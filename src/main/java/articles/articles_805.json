    "title": "New law seeks better protection for caregivers, says Estrada - Manila Standard",
    "text": "CAREGIVERS all over the country can now look forward to better working conditions, better benefits, and protection against all forms of abuses following the enactment of a law ensuring their rights and welfare, Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada said. He noted that this is a big step in improving the condition of Filipino caregivers. Estrada, the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Labor, steered the passage into law of Republic Act No. 11965, also known as the “Caregivers’ Welfare Act.” Estrada underscored the need to defend the rights and ensure the protection against harassment, violence, and economic exploitation of those who devote their lives to caring for others. “It is essential to protect them from any mistreatment. Caregivers are frequently undervalued and should be treated with dignity, respect, and fairness,” he stressed. Aside from RA 11965 which was signed into law on Nov. 23, Estrada also stood as co-author and co-sponsor of several bills that are national in scope that were signed into law this year by the President. Among these are the New Agrarian Emancipation Act (RA 11953), One Town, One Product (OTOP) Philippines Program (RA 11960), Automatic Income Classification of Local Government Units Act (RA 11964), Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Code of the Philippines (RA 11966), Internet Transactions Act of 2023 (RA 11967), and the Cultural Mapping Law (RA 11961). In pushing for the enactment of RA 11964, Estrada said that the income classification of LGUs is already outdated and is no longer in consonance with the prevailing economic conditions and their overall financial status. “For LGUs to remain dynamic and consistent, the institutionalization of the automatic income classification is a welcome development as it will improve their status and correctly reflect their financial capacity. By regularly assessing any changes in their capacity, the LGUs can formulate and direct policies accordingly and better align themselves with the national government’s financial and fiscal policies,” said Estrada, who is a former local chief executive. Estrada, who filed his version of the Internet Transactions Act on July 25, 2022, also noted the need to establish an effective regulation of commercial activities done through the internet to ensure consumer rights and secure online transactions. “Internet transaction is inevitable in the globalized world that has entered the fourth industrial revolution where we are now in. We cannot escape or delay it. Instead, we should embrace it to optimize its benefits while guarding our economy and our people from its deceptive and unfair practices,” he said. Meanwhile, Estrada also backed the enactment of RA 11961, emphasizing the importance of having a record-keeping of the country’s tangible and intangible heritage for the empowerment of communities, education of the younger generation and the wider population. As to the OTOP Philippines Act, the senator said the measure seeks to promote products and services of the different localities nationwide and more importantly, to strengthen micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that comprise 99.58% of all the businesses in the country. Two significant laws were also passed this year, namely RA 11958 which raises the disability pension of veterans, and RA 11939, which mandates fixed terms for the primary officials of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). These laws were principally authored and sponsored by Estrada as Chairperson of the Senate Defense Committee.",

    "text": "The Minister of Labor, Gloria Ines Ramirez, announced that the minimum wage will increase by 12% by 2024, meaning workers will receive an additional $140,000, increasing from earnings of $1,160,000 to now $1,300,000. Following the announcement by the head of the Labor Department, the President of the Republic, Gustavo Petro, spoke, sending a message to businessmen, and proposing a new tax reform to “increase productive activity”. In this regard, the Unitary Central of Workers (CUT) celebrated the wage increase figures for 2024 announced by the President of the Republic, Gustavo Petro, which will contribute to the improvement of the purchasing power of Colombian workers. “It is not what we were thinking, but it is positive, because it regains some purchasing power; However, we register negatively the attitude of the business community, which does not want to recognize the efforts of the workers in terms of wages and their income, unfortunately they remain in extremely low positions,” said CUT President. Fabio Arias said. , Similarly, the CUT includes presidential declarations regarding demands from the Bank of the Republic to cut interest rates; Seek mechanisms to reduce rates for public services, especially electricity; Review taxes and review tax reform for clean energy and tourism, but especially seek an economic context and future that improves productivity and the state of the national productive system. Read Also: He wanted to get a visa for the United States, but he made a fatal mistake and denied: \"I don't know whether to laugh or cry.\" CUT will accompany the National Agreement Table for Productivity proposed by the National Government, which will work through its proposals and debates in informal consultation tables to improve the living conditions of Colombian workers. Fenalco also told about minimum wage FENALCO President Jaime Alberto Cabal called the unilateral decision by national government decree to increase the minimum wage by 12% a mistake for the reactivation of the economy. The commerce sector will be the first to suffer, as indeed reflected in the negative figures recorded throughout 2023. “Commerce is a sector that is, as a general rule, formal and which creates the largest number of minimum wage jobs in the country, a situation that makes it all the more sensitive to decisions taken today regarding minimum wages Is.” We warned, based on a study by the Bank of the Republic, that each percentage increase in the minimum wage, above inflation and productivity – in the case of last year, negative – implies a loss of about 72,000 jobs.",

    "text": "US President Joe Biden said Thursday that he will remain a stalwart ally of Ukraine and will work to marshal international support as Kyiv continues to confront an ongoing Russian invasion. The president said that during meetings with his NATO allies in Washington, he made it clear that he \"will not bow down to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\" \"I will not walk away from Ukraine. I will keep NATO strong. That's exactly what we did, and exactly what we'll continue to do,\" he told reporters during a tightly-watched press conference. \"For those who thought NATO's time had passed, they got a rude awakening when Putin invaded Ukraine. Some of the oldest and deepest fears in Europe roared back to life, because once again, a murderous madman was on the march,\" he added, referring to the Russian president. Much of this week's summit focused squarely on Ukraine and ensuring Kyiv has what it needs to defend itself to eventually oust Russia from the territories it continues to occupy after two years of grueling war. The announcements made this week culminated with the signing of what is known as the Ukraine Compact, which is a shared pledge among 22 NATO allies and partners to ensure Ukraine has what it needs in the long term. Additional weapons transfers were also announced, including the provision of five Patriot air defense systems, and the announcement that F-16 fighter jets long-sought by Zelenskyy are on their way to Ukraine and will be flying above the war-torn nation’s skies this summer.

    "title": "Sapaciencia cita estudiantes para revocarles beneficios por presuntas irregularidades",
    "text": "Antioquia\nMás de 200 estudiantes beneficiarios del programa PUAP de Sapiencia recibieron una resolución oficial en la que se les solicita emitir su consentimiento para revocar parcialmente los beneficios de matrícula y sostenimiento que les fueron otorgados en las convocatorias 2023-2 y 2024-1. El documento, identificado como Resolución N.º 2892 del 10 de junio de 2025, ha generado preocupación entre los jóvenes, quienes temen perder un apoyo clave para continuar sus estudios universitarios.\nLa resolución fue expedida por la Agencia de Educación Postsecundaria de Medellín – Sapiencia, en ejercicio de sus funciones legales y en cumplimiento del Acuerdo Distrital 055 de 2022 y el Decreto 032 de 2023. Allí se establece que los créditos condonables con recursos ordinarios están destinados exclusivamente a estudiantes pertenecientes a los estratos 1, 2, 3 y 4.\n“Después de haberse realizado el proceso de auditoría, se hace necesaria la revocatoria parcial de las resoluciones 2025 de 2023 y 3763 de 2023, a través de las cuales se otorgó el puntaje que permitió la selección de beneficiarios que, según el estrato declarado, pertenecen a los estratos 5 y 6”, dice textualmente el acto administrativo.\nSegún lo estipulado, los recursos ordinarios transferidos al municipio solo pueden beneficiar a los estratos 1 al 4. Para los estratos 5 y 6, solo es posible acceder a los beneficios si su financiación proviene del presupuesto participativo, mecanismo que sí permite incluir a estudiantes de mayores niveles socioeconómicos.\nEl director de Sapiencia, Salomón Cruz, aclaró que esta solicitud de revocatoria es voluntaria y no implica una suspensión inmediata de los beneficios. Reiteró que los estudiantes continuarán recibiendo los giros correspondientes mientras cumplen con los requisitos del programa, como las horas de servicio social.\n“No es una medida arbitraria. Estamos cumpliendo con lo que nos exige la ley tras una auditoría. Pero también estamos acompañando a los estudiantes y será un juez quien determine si se deben mantener o no estos apoyos”, expresó Cruz.\nLa resolución incluye un listado de los beneficiarios implicados, entre ellos estudiantes de diversas áreas académicas. Aunque solo uno de ellos ha aceptado revocar el beneficio de forma voluntaria, el resto continuará vinculado mientras se resuelve la situación por vía legal.\nLa controversia ha abierto un debate sobre la equidad en la asignación de recursos educativos y la interpretación del estrato como único criterio de acceso. Algunos estudiantes argumentan que vivir en un estrato alto no implica tener la capacidad económica para costear una carrera profesional.",
