    "title": "Trump portrays 2024 race as a Christian battle, akin to D-Day",
    "text": "By Nathan Layne and Tim Reid\n(Reuters) – Donald Trump urged Christians on Thursday to support him in the 2024 presidential election, a contest he depicted in religious terms and likened to the great battles of World War Two.\nSpeaking at a forum for Christian broadcasters in Nashville, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination compared the stakes for the election to D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge and said God’s involvement was needed to rescue the country.\n“Today we are in another struggle for survival of our nation,” Trump told the event organized by the National Religious Broadcasters association. “This time the greatest threat is not from the outside of our country, I really believe this: it’s from within.”\n“I am here today because I know that to achieve victory in this fight, just like in the battles of the past, we still need the hand of our Lord, and the grace of Almighty God.”\nSince launching his campaign in late 2022, Trump has regularly painted the state of the country in apocalyptic terms, seeking to undermine President Joe Biden’s support ahead of a likely rematch for the White House.\nAPPEALING TO CHRISTIAN BASE\nTrump has at times sought to portray the choice facing Americans in November as one of good versus evil, couching his rhetoric in language that appeals to the conservative Christian voters who form a core of his support base.\nConservative Christian voters credit Trump for a series of policy victories including the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion.\nThe thrice-married Trump has retained that support even as faces a criminal trial next month in New York that stems from alleged hush money paid to a porn star. It is one of four criminal prosecutions facing Trump, who has derided them all as politically motivated.\n“I’m a very proud Christian, actually,” Trump said. “I’ve been very busy fighting and, you know, taking the bullets, taking the arrows. I’m taking them for you and I’m so honored to take them, you have no idea.”\nCalling the prosecutors “bad people,” Trump attempted to create common cause with his audience by raising fears that the Biden administration was planning to go after Christians and their organizations – despite a lack of evidence to support such an assertion.\n“Christians, they can’t afford to sit on the sidelines in this fight,” Trump said. “The radical left is coming after all of us because they know that our allegiance is not to them. Our allegiance is to our country and our allegiance is to our creator.”\nThe former president’s appearance in the Tennessee capital is no coincidence. The state is one of many holding primaries and caucuses on “Super Tuesday” on March 5, the biggest day of nominating contests.\nTrump is far ahead of Nikki Haley, his sole challenger in the Republican race. He is favored by 30 percentage points in South Carolina’s first-in-the-South primary on Saturday, according to the polling average maintained by website FiveThirtyEight.\nIn his speech, Trump referred to people imprisoned for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as “hostages,” repeating language he has used several times as a way to embrace his supporters involved in the riot.\n(Reporting by Nathan Layne in Charleston, South Carolina, and Tim Reid in Washington; Editing by William Mallard)",

    "text": "Premier Bank faces labour adviser’s stern warning\nLabour and Employment Adviser Brig Gen (Retired) M Sakhawat Hussain today warned Premier Bank of action if it does not disburse cash incentives by the government meant for a garment factory to clear wages ahead of the Eid.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the secretariat in Dhaka, Hussain said the bank was adjusting previous loans of Apparels Eco Ltd, a concern of TNZ Group, instead of releasing the funds designated for workers' wages.\nHe urged the bank's managing director to immediately disburse the amount, warning of stern action otherwise.\n\"You must release the money. If your bank does not comply, you will be held responsible,\" he said.\n\"I will file a criminal case against him. The money has already been provided to the bank, disbursed from the Bangladesh Bank.\"\nHussain said that the funds were government incentives, not subject to loan adjustments.\n\"The government has released this money. There is no provision for adjusting loans with it,\" he said.\nCriticising the bank's stance, he said, \"Premier Bank provided the factory with loans but later forgot its responsibility. This is the workers' money—you must release it. If you do not, remember, I am here as long as I am alive.\"\nHe also warned of action against the bank, its branch, its managing director, and its manager if the disbursement was further delayed.\n\"I have heard that Premier Bank continues to adjust the money instead of releasing it. I am asking the managing director once again—please disburse the funds. You are a private bank; do not take this lightly.\"\n\"The government has arranged this money. If Premier Bank refuses to disburse it, this will be considered an act against the state and the government,\" he added.\n\"I will take whatever action is necessary. This is the government's money—do not stand against the government. Do not test our patience,\" he warned.\nThe Daily Star tried to reach Mohammad Abu Jafar, managing director and CEO of Premier Bank, over the phone regarding the issue.\nIn response, an official of the bank said, \"We have already disbursed the payment, but it was done after receiving approval from the central bank.\"",

    "text": "Cumulus Media Boise’s KBOI-AM, in collaboration with the US Marine Corps Reserve, just completed “Idaho’s Largest Toy Drive” for the seventh year in a row. The event set new records by collecting over 34,257 toys, more than 200 bicycles, and $63,336 in cash donations for Toys for Tots with assistance from sister station KIZN. The drive supports children in Idaho, Eastern Oregon, and Northern Nevada. KBOI PD Nate Shelman expressed “It is truly amazing to see the audience, station partners and other businesses come out, in force, year after year. To think, in the past seven years, this audience has filled almost twenty 53-foot trailers. Each toy, book and bike bring Christmas to a kid and a family in need and lets them know we support them.” First Sergeant Kaleb Wagy from the 4th Marine Division, 4th LAR Battalion Company C, also remarked on the success of the drive, saying, “This year’s ‘Idaho’s Largest Toy Drive’ accounted for more than half of the toys collected in this year’s campaign. Because of this effort, Charlie Co., was able to help more than 15,000 kids and families in the Treasure Valley. We are already looking forward to next year!” Radio Ink‘s 2023 Season of Giving Tally now stands at $28.11 million. Help us show how radio matters to local communities!

La population souffre d’un traumatisme collectif puissant. « Notre pays n’a jamais enduré une telle épreuve », explique Alon Pauker, spécialiste de l’histoire des kibboutz, ces communautés collectives créées par des sionistes socialistes au siècle dernier, qui forment l’ADN de l’État hébreu. L’historien de 57 ans vit depuis 2007 à Be’eri, l’un des villages pris d’assaut par les terroristes. Ici, 96 personnes ont été tuées. Une jeune femme a été violée devant sa famille, puis abattue. Des stigmates toujours visibles A LIRELa Cheika du Qatar interpellée pour faciliter la libération des otages israéliens à Gaza Alon Pauker nous entraîne à travers son kibboutz. De nombreuses habitations portent les stigmates de l’attaque du [Hamas](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/proche-orient/israel-palestine/guerre-israel-hamas-ce-qu-il-faut-retenir-de-la-journee-du-mercredi-21-fevrier_6380257.html) : impacts de balles, brèches provoquées par des tirs de roquettes ou des jets de grenades, traces de sang. Plusieurs personnes ont été kidnappées. « Cent cinquante terroristes nous ont attaqués. Ils avaientconnaissance de détails très précis sur nos maisons. Ils connaissaient même le nom des habitants, savaient précisément où ils vivaient, où étaient entreposées nos armes. En fait, ils savaient tout. Ils avaient ces informations par des Gazaouis qui travaillaient dans la région. » Affligé, il nous fait part des questions qui assaillent les membres de sa communauté : « Nous soutenions le dialogue avec les Palestiniens. Nousétions partisans d’une solution à deux États. Mais après l’horreur que nous avons endurée, je n’ai plus confiance. » Il s’assoit quelques instants, nous regarde d’un air anxieux, puis reprend : « Je ne crois plus à la paix dans un avenir proche. Mais je sais bien qu’il n’y a pas d’autre solution que celle de voir un jour deux États, l’un palestinien, l’autre israélien, coexister. Sans cela, une bombe finira par nous exploser à la figure. » Officiellement, 134 otages sont encore détenus à [Gaza](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2024/02/22/la-bande-de-gaza-est-affamee-apres-quatre-mois-et-demi-de-siege-par-l-armee_6217887_3210.html). Une priorité pour le gouvernement, qui a mobilisé près de 300 000 réservistes pour livrer une guerre totale au Hamas, mais dont la stratégie divise, à droite comme à gauche. « Nous jouons notre survie » « Je n’ai jamais critiqué Benyamin Nétanyahou, même si je sais qu’il a trempé dans des affaires de corruption. Je pense même qu’il a raison de vouloir éradiquer le Hamas », témoigne Yohann, un ancien militaire qui a perdu trois amis le 7 octobre. « Mes propos vont vous paraître choquants, mais avec ce que fait notre armée à Gaza, le monde entier, à commencer par les Arabes, comprend qu’Israël ne se laissera plus jamais faire (…). Pour la première fois depuis la création de notre État, nous jouons notre survie. Ce n’est pas une guerre comme celles que nous avons vécues en 1967 ou en 1973. Ce que le Hamas a fait est comparable aux crimes des SS. Ça rappelle la Shoah. Il fallait une riposte forte. À ceux qui nous condamnent en Europe, je demande : “Quelle autre solution avions-nous ?” Vous rendez-vous compte de ce qui s’est passé ? Imaginez un instant que cela se produise chez vous, comment réagiriez-vous ? » Yohann nuance toutefois son propos : « Le problème, c’est la question des otages. On ne sait pas combien sont en vie. La population en veut à Bibi (surnom de Nétanyahou, NDLR) , car il ne les a pas tous ramenés. Il a aussi montré à quel point il avait failli sur le renseignement. Il a non seulement été incapable d’empêcher l’assaut du Hamas, mais en plus, il a pensé qu’il pouvait le manipuler ». De nombreux Israéliens s’interrogent sur la stratégie militaire À travers le pays, nombreux sont ceux qui pensent qu’il fallait d’abord négocier pour obtenir la libération des otages et ensuite faire la guerre au Hamas. « On a l’impression que le gouvernement ne sait pas où il va. Le fait de tuer des civils à Gaza, même s’ils ne sont pas ciblés, est une tragédie. Car tous les Palestiniens ne sont pas coupables des crimes du Hamas (…). Comment allons-nous faire grandir nos enfants avec les leurs, après ce qui se passe ? Cela pose la question de notre avenir commun », insiste Yohann. Alors que [Tsahal](https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/israel-tsahal-diffuse-des-images-de-la-prise-d-otage-du-bebe-kfir-neuf-mois-et-de-sa-famille-a-gaza-20240220) poursuit ses opérations dans la bande de Gaza, le pays est attaqué chaque jour sur son front nord par les miliciens libanais du Hezbollah. L’armée est également confrontée à la menace des milices pro-iraniennes basées en Syrie, pays frontalier. Au début du mois, elle a bombardé le quartier général de l’une d’elles, non loin de Damas. Le traité de paix israélo-égyptien, qui perdure depuis quarante-cinq ans, semble, quant à lui, menacé ces derniers jours. Autre point qui inquiète les Israéliens : depuis le début du conflit, l’économie est en partie paralysée. Un exemple saisissant : alors que la “tech” représente 18 % du PIB, nombre de ses cadres et de ses employés sont mobilisés, ce qui touche considérablement le secteur. Un signe ne trompe pas, ce sont les parkings des entreprises, généralement bondés, qui sont à moitié vides. Une rupture historique Chaque semaine à Tel-Aviv, comme dans le reste du pays, de nombreuses manifestations anti-Nétanyahou sont organisées. Elles se tiennent parfois à quelques centaines de mètres des rassemblements de soutien aux otages. Ethan, un réserviste de 30 ans venu assister à l’une d’elles, explique : « Nétanyahou a remis en cause les fondements institutionnels du pays. Ce qui le préoccupait, c’était de se maintenir à l’abri des poursuites judiciaires. Il a joué la carte du rapprochement avec les extrémistes religieux en leur faisant des concessions, car ils sont les seuls à le soutenir. Mais qui sont ces gens ? Non seulement ils ne font pas leur service militaire, mais en plus, ils ne sont pas connectés à la société israélienne. Ils n’ont aucune vision. Ils neressemblent en rien à ceux qui nous ont dirigés auparavant car ils n’ont jamais combattu pour défendre le pays. Ils ne savent pas ce que ça fait de voir son fils ou sa fille partir à la guerre. Cette situation représente une rupture dans notre histoire. Je pense que le problème vient de là. » Un sondage réalisé en juillet dernier montrait que plus d’un quart des Israéliens envisageaient de quitter le pays. Ils seraient d’ailleurs plus de 400 000 à être partis depuis le 7 octobre. « Malgré le terrorisme et les conflits que nous avons connus, Israël était considéré, depuis 1948, comme un sanctuaire pourles juifs qui avaient fui l’Europe. Aujourd’hui, ce n’est plus le cas. Al ors, on se demande comment on peut continuer à vivre en tant que nation si l’État ne parvient plus à nous défendre. Ce que nous avons subi le 7 octobre remet en question soixante-seize ans d’histoire. Et ce n’est pas une affaire de droite ou de gauche », commente avec emportement Sam, la cinquantaine grisonnante, qui dirige une exploitation agricole dans les environs de Beersheba, ce de centre administratif pour le sud d’Israël. Il reprend : « Mes grands-parents ont émigré en Israël en sachant qu’ils auraient à se battre. En retour, ilsavaient la certitude qu’ils seraient protégés. Maintenant, je me demande si je ne serais pas mieux en Europe. Là-bas, il y a de l’antisémitisme, mais les commandos du Hamas ne viennent pas vous égorger dans votre maison parce que vous êtes juif. » Pour tous, la priorité est de rester unis face à l’ennemi Malgré les doutes dont ils nous ont fait part, aucun des Israéliens avec qui nous avons parlé ne semble résigné à voir le pays se briser davantage sur les divisions politiques. L’urgence, pour tous, est de rester unis face aux périls, qu’il s’agisse de l’Iran ou de ses pions. Yohann l’affirme : « Nous savons que Nétanyahou est en sursis, même si c’est un bon tacticien et qu’il peut encore tenir trois ans. L’espoir, c’est de voir une coalition s’organiser pour prendre la suite de Bibi. » Des noms reviennent régulièrement : ceux de l’ex-Premier ministre Yair Lapid et de l’ancien chef d’état-major de l’armée israélienne Benny Gantz, qui est aussi le chef de l’opposition, ce que nous a confirmé le géopolitologue Frédéric Encel, auteur de l’Atlas géopolitique d’Israël (Autrement). Selon cet éminent spécialiste, « il existe une fissure importante en Israël, mais moins entre les citoyens qu’entre la population et le gouvernement. Plus des trois quarts des Israéliens, soit bien davantage que la gauche et le centre réunis, critiquent Nétanyahou et son gouvernement pour leur impéritie et leur inconséquence ayant mené au cataclysme. C’est du jamais-vu dans ce pays, surtout en temps de guerre. Mais avant d’être divisée, la population reste soudée et déterminée face aux barbares islamistes du Hamas. » La solidarité, nous l’avons constaté tout au long de notre périple en Israël, demeure le ciment essentiel qui unit cette société. Ce qui confère à ses membres, sans aucun doute, l’impressionnante résilience dont ils font preuve.",

The officials are expecting a congregation of more than 50 lakh pilgrims on the day. Director General of Police (DGP) Prashant Kumar and Chief Secretary D.S. Mishra are closely monitoring the preparations being made for Ram Navami and the nine-day long ‘Ram Janamotsav’ starting from April 9 which will conclude on April 17. The chief secretary and DGP, who also visited Ram Janmabhoomi and reviewed security arrangements at the temple complex, have asked officials to make proper arrangements for devotees to make their visit to Ram temple comfortable. Ram Navami, the festival to celebrate the birth of Lord Ram, will be observed on the ninth day of the ‘Chaitra Navratri’ . According to officials , they are working on a war footing to ensure the safety and comfort of the devotees during Ram Navami. However, it is tough to gauge the actual number of expected devotees and different teams are working on it. Officials are pondering over multi entries and exits for devotees to avoid any stampede-like situation. Keeping in view the hot weather, water and mats on the open floors are also being arranged to save devotees from heat stroke. Officials are also ensuring availability and regular supply of essentials such as milk, sugar, tea, foodgrains and vegetables, etc., in dharamshalas, temples, tent cities and hotels where the pilgrims will stay.
