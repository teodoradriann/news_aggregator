    "text": "Hina Khan , best known for her role in Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai, is battling with stage three of breast cancer. The actress is courageously fighting the cancer battle and has kept fans updated with her journey through. She recently entered a new phase of her life as she got married to longtime boyfriend Rocky Jaiswal. Hina has now made a revelation claiming how she had to throw tons of her hair-care products due to her cancer diagnosis. Hina shared a video on her Instagram stories while opening up about how she had to throw tons of her hair-care products, which got expired as she wasn’t able to use them due to her cancer diagnosis. She further mentioned how she hates wasting her hard-earned money, and she has learnt a lesson now. Hina Khan Shares Cozy Moment With Rocky Jaiswal In the video, she showed the products and said, “All these products are now a waste. I used to keep 3–4 backups of all my products so that I can use it whenever I need. However, because of my cancer diagnosis, I lost all my hair and couldn’t use these products. Now when my hair is growing back, everything has expired. I feel so bad but have learnt an important lesson.” Poll Do you think sharing personal struggles helps celebrities connect with their fans? Yes, definitely No, it doesn't matter She later shared a long note talking about the same. The post read, “Kaash thoda bhi khayal aaya hota to apni family mai hi distribute kar deti but me and my fam, hum pareshaani mai iss qadar ghire hue the ki kuch aur yaad hi nahi tha… It’s my hard-earned money and I hate to waste anything… Koi nai, lesson learnt. You lose some, you win some… Allah achi sehat de. That’s more important thn anything else.” On the work front, Hina is best known for her role in Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai. Moreover, Hina and Rocky are geared up for their first on-screen appearance together on Pati Patni Aur Panga.

    "title": "Controversy surrounds legislation that would likely ban pride flags in schools",
    "text": "Certain flags won't fly in Tennessee schools if state lawmakers pass a new proposal. Only American flags and the official state flag would be allowed on display if HB 1605 is passed. As it is written, public and charter schools could not put up certain political, movement of activism flags such as pride flags. It is pride flags that many people believe are the true target of the bill which was introduced by republican state Rep. Gino Bulso, R- Brentwood. \"With the teachers I've talked to, they have stated that this is censorship,\" said Eli Givens, a recent graduate of Summit High School in Williamson County. Givens, a 19-year-old active advocate with the Tennessee Equality Project, says schools are supposed to be welcoming and inclusive. Pride flags make some students feel comfortable. \"I see a lot on teacher's desks, or on the wall, or they'll have a sticker being like you are safe here. And I don't know what exactly is wrong with that,\" Givens said. NewsChannel 5 reached out for comment from Rep. Bulso, but a spokesperson said he was unavailable. Tennessee law already mandates that all public schools display the American flag. No state has implemented a universal ban on all other flags in schools. \"School is meant to be an environment where students can come — especially queer youth, because a lot aren't accepted in their homes, especially in Tennessee — and [it's] a place you can find solace, and trusted adults you might not have at home,\" Givens said. The bill could also target several other flags, including the Black Lives Matter flag. On Jan. 22, the Tennessee Equality Project is planning Pride Flag Day at the Capitol. People can go to the Capitol at 3 p.m. with their favorite flag to protest the bill. “Grab your tissues for this one. Chris Davis brings us a beautiful story of one man at the end of his life, and another just beginning his in many ways, and their fast and deep friendship forged by happenstance. Trust me, this one is worth your time.\"",

    "text": "WACO, Texas — Baylor University and Waco Mammoth National Monument will celebrate the transfer of \"thousands of fossils and original photographs\" from excavations by Baylor to the National Park Service (NPS) on Oct. 21, the university has announced. A signing ceremony commemorating the transfer will be held at the Mayborn Museum Complex on campus at 1 p.m. that afternoon. While the donation gives legal ownership of the [fossils](/article/news/local/fossilized-mammoth-tooth-found/500-9e22be15-eb43-4082-9d4c-f33081fd0a0a) and materials to the NPS, Baylor said it and the Mayborn Museum Complex are officially designated partners of Waco Mammoth National Monument, and will stay in possession of the materials as the \"repository for all federally owned specimens\". \"The Mayborn Museum will continue its stewardship of all fossils excavated from Waco Mammoth National Monument, and we are committed to supporting this important partnership between the university, the National Park Service, the City of Waco and the Waco Mammoth Foundation,” said Mayborn Museum Director, Charles Walter. “We look forward to years of exciting work ahead as Dr. Yann’s research unveils new information about the Ice Age and the incredible creatures that once roamed our region.” According to Baylor University, excavations and fossil collection began in 1978 and continued through the 1980s and 1990s under the direction of the Baylor University Strecker Museum, which is now the Mayborn Museum Complex. The university's collection documents the history and deposit of the only known nursery herd of Columbian mammoths, which mostly includes females and their children, Baylor said. While most of the fossils belong to Columbian mammoths, the site also reportedly includes other animals like fish, turtles, alligators, birds, camels, horses and bison that lived in Central Texas approximately 65,000 years ago. All fossils that were discovered in the area remained in Waco thanks to the dedication of Baylor staff and volunteers, the university said. Specimens that are still in the ground are on display at Waco Mammoth National Monument and all donated specimens are housed in the Geosciences Collections at the Mayborn Museum Complex. “It is amazing to be able to study all the site’s fossils in one city,” said site paleontologist Dr. Lindsey Yann. “Instead of having to travel to many institutions, I just drive less than 10 miles to the Mayborn Museum.” The donation also reportedly includes multiple \"large\" field jackets of mammoth bones, said Baylor. The work will reportedly be an \"ongoing collaboration\" between the university and the National Park Service to try and \"understand life in Central Texas 65,000 years ago\". \"The National Park Service is honored to accept the donation of this important collection from Baylor University, with whom we share a dynamic partnership as stewards of the key resources for which Waco Mammoth National Monument was established,” said Acting Superintendent Christine Jacobs. “Together, we are committed to the protection and conservation of the site to inspire visitors, foster a learning environment, and support on-going research with the continued and unwavering support from the City of Waco and the Waco Mammoth Foundation.\" More from 6 News:",

    "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- KNN India) New Delhi, Mar 14 (KNN) Economists at Morgan Stanley have identified investment as a significant catalyst behind India's burgeoning economy, drawing parallels to the robust expansion witnessed in the mid-2000s. This resurgence in investment, particularly from private enterprises, alongside expanding exports and a more stable economic environment, signals promising prospects for India's economic trajectory. According to Morgan Stanley economists, India's investment as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is on a steady upward trajectory, poised to reach 36 per cent by 2027 from a recent low of 28 per cent in 2021. This surge mirrors the period between 2003-2007 when investment ratios soared to 39 per cent. The economists project a prolonged growth cycle, indicating ample room for expansion in the current economic landscape. India, acclaimed as the world's fastest-growing major economy, recorded a remarkable growth rate of 8.4 per cent in the last quarter of the previous year. However, a nuanced analysis reveals a deceleration in growth when accounting for one-off factors, prompting considerations regarding the sustainability of India's growth trajectory. Echoing sentiments from Morgan Stanley, economists at Societe Generale highlight investment's pivotal role in propelling India's economic engine. They note early indications of a resurgence in private capital expenditure, indicative of a broader-based investment surge. India's top economic adviser also underscores sustained signs of capital formation, projecting economic expansion exceeding 7 per cent in the upcoming fiscal year, commencing in April. The impetus on investment has resonated positively in key sectors, as evidenced by the remarkable performance of the S&P BSE Industrials Index. This index, encompassing diverse sectors including bridge manufacturing, helicopter production, and wind turbine manufacturing, has surged over 71 per cent in the past year. Such remarkable growth underscores the collective market confidence, amplifying the value of its constituents by over USD 175 billion.

I took the first doorbell back and was given a new one, but that has the same problem. I have tried several transformers. The last one is certainly strong enough.\nIt is on sporadically but was off with an \"empty battery\" yesterday from 13.30 to 18.30.\nThe problem seems to be that the bell apparently cannot work when there are dozens, if not hundreds, of pedestrians and cyclists passing every hour.\nSunday\nHi [@MartinCleaver](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/276414),\nThanks for the follow-up.\nPlease try the steps here:\nLet me know how it goes.\nRegards,\nMelany\nSunday\nHi Melany,\nThanks, but I have done this too.\nSunday\nI am curious.

    "text": "MADRID 27 Mar. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa Sala de lo Social de la Audiencia Nacional ha anulado la constitución de la mesa de negociadora del I Convenio Colectivo de tripulantes de cabina de pasajeros (TCP) de Ryanair, así como todos los acuerdos acordados.\nSegún ha informado el sindicato USO, esta sentencia supone la anulación del convenio, que se empezó a aplicar pero sin registrarse en la Dirección General de Trabajo, y que se empiece a \"cumplir con la legalidad al negociar un convenio franja\", es decir, que incluye a un colectivo de la empresa.\nUSO-Sector Aéreo presentó demanda de conflicto colectivo para impugnar la mesa de negociación del convenio para los tripulantes de cabina ya que se consideraba que se negociaba un convenio franja y no un convenio de empresa, ya que el único colectivo en Ryanair sin convenio eran los TCP.\nEn este caso, según señala el sindicato, al negociarse un convenio franja, la composición de la mesa negociadora a través de las secciones sindicales requiere la designación a través de asambleas de trabajadores, que no se celebraron en este caso.\nTras conocer la sentencia, USO-Sector Aéreo se muestra satisfecho por la decisión judicial y ha declarado que seguirá trabajando para hacer las asambleas de TCP en las que se refleje \"la voluntad del colectivo para negociar un convenio al menos legal, tanto en la forma, como en el contenido\".\nLeer más acerca de:",

    "text": "How to remove the Oovi Appc potentially unwanted application\n Written by Tomas Meskauskas on\nWhat kind of application is Oovi Appc?\nWhile inspecting deceptive sites, our researchers discovered an installation setup containing Oovi Appc. This piece of software is classed as a PUA ([Potentially Unwanted Application](/common-types-of-computer-infections#potentially-unwanted-application)). These apps typically possess harmful functionalities.\nWhat is more, PUAs tend to infiltrate systems in bundles (i.e., packed together with other unwanted or malicious software). This is true of the Oovi Appc installer that we investigated.\nPotentially unwanted application overview\nAs mentioned in the introduction, potentially unwanted applications tend to have harmful capabilities. Data-tracking functionalities are the most prevalent in these apps. Targeted information may include: browsing and search engine histories, Internet cookies, log-in credentials (usernames/passwords), personally identifiable details, credit card numbers, etc. The gathered data can be monetized via sale to third-parties (potentially, cyber criminals).\nPUAs can also operate as [adware](/common-types-of-computer-infections#adware) and [browser hijackers](/common-types-of-computer-infections#browser-hijacker). Advertising-supported software can display third-party graphical content (ads) or generate redirects to various websites. These advertisements promote deceptive and malicious content. Once clicked on, some of the adverts can even execute scripts to perform sneaky downloads/installations.\nBrowser-hijacking software modifies browser settings (e.g., default search engines, homepages, new tab/window URLs, etc.) to promote their webpages. Typically, hijackers endorse fake search engines that cannot provide search results and redirect to legitimate Internet search websites (e.g., [Yahoo](/removal-guides/8835-search-yahoo-com-redirect), [Bing](/removal-guides/9633-bing-com-redirect), [Google](/removal-guides/4251-remove-google-redirect-virus), etc.). In the seldom instances that these sites can generate search results – they are inaccurate and may include sponsored, unreliable, deceptive, and potentially malicious content.\nKeep in mind that PUAs can possess other abilities aside from those described in this article. In summary, the presence of unwanted software on devices may result in system infections, serious privacy issues, financial losses, and even identity theft.\nName | Oovi Appc potentially unwanted application |\nThreat Type | PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program), PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) |\nDetection Names (installer) | AliCloud (Trojan:Win/Agent.AUXZ), ESET-NOD32 (Win32/Agent.AGOE), Tencent (Unk.Win32.Script.404795), Full List Of Detections (\n|\nTo eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software. Our security researchers recommend using Combo Cleaner.[▼ Download Combo Cleaner ](/download-combo-cleaner-windows)\nTo use full-featured product, you have to purchase a license for Combo Cleaner. 7 days free trial available. Combo Cleaner is owned and operated by Rcs Lt, the parent company of PCRisk.com read more.\nPotentially unwanted application examples\n[ResearchSecure](/removal-guides/31543-researchsecure-potentially-unwanted-application), [BpolApp](/removal-guides/31540-bpolapp-unwanted-application), [KipcApp](/removal-guides/31456-kipcapp-unwanted-application), [RoxiApp](/removal-guides/31340-roxiapp-unwanted-application), and [Civia App](/removal-guides/31396-civia-app-unwanted-application) are just some of our newest articles on potentially unwanted apps.\nApplications of this kind often look legitimate and harmless. Users can be enticed into downloading/installing this software by promises of \"useful\" and \"advantageous\" functionalities. However, these functions rarely work as promised, and in most cases – they are completely nonoperational.\nIt must be stressed that even if a piece of software functions exactly as indicated by its promotional material – that is not a guarantee of legitimacy or safety.\nHow did potentially unwanted applications install on my computer?\nWe downloaded an installer containing Oovi Appc (and other suspect software) from a deceptive webpage. PUAs are promoted on legitimate-looking download sites and scam pages. They are primarily accessed via redirects caused by websites utilizing rogue advertising networks, intrusive adverts, [spam browser notifications](/common-types-of-computer-infections#notification-spam), misspelled URLs, and installed adware.\n\"Bundling\" – packing ordinary program installation setups with unwanted/malicious additions – is also used to spread PUAs. These pre-packed installers can be downloaded from freeware and free file-hosting sites, P2P sharing networks, and other dubious sources. The risk of allowing bundled content into the system is furthered by treating installation processes with negligence (e.g., ignoring terms, skipping sections, using \"Easy/Express\" settings, etc.).\nAdditionally, unwanted software is proliferated by intrusive advertisements. Once clicked on, some of these ads can execute scripts to perform downloads/installations without user consent.\nHow to avoid installation of potentially unwanted applications?\nWe highly recommend researching software and downloading it only from official/verified channels. Installation processes must be approached with care, e.g., by reading terms, exploring available options, using the \"Custom\" or \"Advanced\" settings, and opting out of all supplementary apps, extensions, features, etc.\nAnother recommendation is to be careful while browsing since fake and malicious online content usually appears genuine and harmless. For example, intrusive adverts may look innocuous – however, they redirect to unreliable and questionable sites (e.g., scam-promoting, gambling, adult dating, pornography, etc.).\nShould you keep experiencing advertisements/redirects of this kind, check the device and immediately remove all suspicious applications and browser extensions/plug-ins. If your computer is already infected with PUAs, we recommend running a scan with [Combo Cleaner Antivirus for Windows](/download-combo-cleaner-windows) to automatically eliminate them.\nDeceptive website promoting Oovi Appc application:\nInstant automatic malware removal:\nManual threat removal might be a lengthy and complicated process that requires advanced IT skills.

This goal is typically achieved by promoting content (via ads, redirects, etc.), deceiving users into buying fake activation keys, pushing in-app purchases, collecting/selling private information, and so forth.\nIs Oovi Appc unwanted application legal?\nUsually, unwanted applications are considered legal due to their End User License Agreements (EULAs) providing information concerning the software's behavior.\nIs having Oovi Appc installed on my computer dangerous?\nUnwanted applications tend to have harmful functionalities, such as gathering sensitive information, displaying malicious ads, generating redirects to deceptive/dangerous websites, etc. What is more, this software is often bundled with other harmful programs or browser extensions. Generally, the presence of unwanted apps is associated with system infections, severe privacy issues, financial losses, and identity theft.\nWill Combo Cleaner help me remove Oovi Appc unwanted application?\nCombo Cleaner can scan systems and remove all kinds of threats, including unwanted/malicious applications. It must be mentioned that manual removal (unaided by security software) might not be an ideal solution. In some instances, after an application has been manually removed – various file leftovers remain hidden within the system. Furthermore, the remaining components might continue to run and cause problems. Therefore, thorough software removal is essential.\n▼ Show Discussion",
