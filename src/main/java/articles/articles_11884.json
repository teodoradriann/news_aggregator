    "text": "Port Hueneme residents try to stay afloat following disastrous storms\nPORT HUENEME, Calif.—Luz Rodriguez has lost everything following the flooding from last week’s storm.\n“I've gone through whatever savings I had to pay for all this stuff. I have no money left,” said Rodriguez, who lives in Hueneme Bay.\nThe flooding, which followed a record level of rainfall in the area, destroyed cars, garages, and homes.\nResidents like Rodriguez are scrambling to mitigate further damage and mold by removing wet flooring and damaged walls.\n“The longer we sit in this and leave it, the more damage, the more is going to get out of control. So I'm been working day in, day out,” said Rodriguez.\nIn senior communities like Hueneme Bay where many people are evacuated, residents are left vulnerable to looting and burglary, but Luz says safety is the least of her worries.\n“If they break in, they break in. I mean, you know, where they can take everything is a loss as far as I'm concerned. I mean, I'm happy that I got my truck and I have my life. So I thank God for that. But as far as everything else, it's all gone,” said Rodriguez.\nStill, Port Hueneme Police Department is ramping up efforts to keep people safe. They’ve stepped up patrols not just with officers, but also with traffic enforcement, detectives, and administrative personnel utilizing both marked and unmarked vehicles.\nThey are already making progress after several reports came in regarding suspicious behavior.\nMike Federico, Chief of Police, Port Hueneme\n“There was one individual that the police officers and we arrested him on Christmas morning who is now being tied to several events that occurred in one neighborhood. We're tying that together with both video and eyewitness statements,” said Chief of Police for Port Hueneme Police Department Mike Federico.\nThe police department is urging residents to report any suspicious behavior.\nThe city also says it’s critical for residents to report all property and vehicle damages to Ventura county emergency services.\nThe website for that is www.vcemergency.com",

    "title": "Cotton has a waste problem: This startup says it can solve it | BusinessGreen News",
    "text": "Most cotton garments end up as landfill, but Seattle-based startup Evrnu claims it can recycle those items The emerging textile recycling industry is poised to take another step forward in January when Seattle-based startup [Evrnu](https://www.evrnu.com/) breaks ground on a cotton recycling facility in South Carolina. The facility, which is set to run primarily on renewable energy and have the capacity to create the equivalent of 80,000 T-shirts every year from recycled cotton clothing, is scheduled to come online by the end of 2024. Evrnu's technology addresses a key hurdle in the apparel industry's journey towards sustainability: Textile recycling today is basically non-existent. [Ninety-two million tonnes](https://earth.org/statistics-about-fast-fashion-waste/) of textiles are thrown away each year. About [87 per cent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344920306534) of all that material ends up in landfill. Less than [one per cent](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/05/your-clothes-can-have-afterlife) of the collected material becomes new garments in fibre-to-fibre recycling; most of the rest is downcycled — cut up to be used in rugs, insulation and other lesser-quality products. Evrnu is partnering with [UK fashion and textile innovator Pangaia](https://pangaia.com/) to create recycled clothing made of denim — among the hardest-to-recycle versions of cotton. Taking responsibility Creating a viable, commercial-scale circular economy for cotton would drastically reduce the impact the cotton industry has on the planet. Over [25 million tonnes](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-1472-2_1) of cotton are produced globally each year. Cotton [processing and production](https://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/cotton) requires large amounts of water: about [10,000 litres of water for one kilogram of cotton](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/20/cost-cotton-water-challenged-india-world-water-day). The crop also degrades soil quality, and increases pollution and carbon emissions from the production of and use of fertilisers and pesticides. The [top cotton producers](https://www.datapandas.org/ranking/cotton-production-by-country) are India (6.2 million tonnes), China (6.2 million tonnes) and the US (3.6 million tonnes). The European Commission has proposed rules for [extended producer responsibility](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3635) (EPR), where the producer has to take responsibility (pay for) the entire life cycle of their products, including the waste they generate. EPR fees will go toward funding collection and recycling. Five states in the [US have passed EPR](https://www.ncsl.org/environment-and-natural-resources/extended-producer-responsibility#:~:text=In%20the%20U.S.%2C%20five%20states,not%20a%20full%20EPR%20system.) laws, primarily focused on packaging. \"In the United States, we landfill and incinerate somewhere around 90 million tonnes of textiles a year,\" said Karla Magruder, founder of the non-profit [Accelerating Circularity.](https://www.acceleratingcircularity.org/) \"We're making a lot of new materials — putting energy, chemicals and water into them and … just throwing them away.\" \"If we want to move to circular, textile-to-textile recycling systems, we need the whole system in place,\" Magruder said. Solid to liquid, and back Stacy Flynn, founder and CEO of Evrnu, started researching the cotton recycling process in 2011 after a trip to China opened her eyes to the environmental damage produced by the textile industry. While studying for an MBA in sustainable systems at Pinchot University, in Washington state, Flynn shredded an old college T-shirt, dissolved it in a chemical solution and then, using a syringe, [squirted the solution into a bath of sulfuric acid](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160369456A1/en), which re-solidified the liquified cotton into new 'threads'. That was the first prototype of the process now called [NuCycle](https://www.evrnu.com/nucycl). The [patented system](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160369456A1/en) mechanically and chemically reduces a solid cotton to a pulp and then reconstitutes it into fibres for new clothes. The garments are first separated by a grading machine to select the clothes that are the closest to 100 per cent cotton — the rest are discarded for traditional downcycling. The end result, says Evrnu, is a premium fabric made from completely recycled cotton that performs like virgin cotton — and itself is 100 per cent recyclable. \"By linking the existing waste supply chain to the existing apparel supply chain, we can start essentially creating a closed circuit supply chain as we create new products,\" said Flynn. Denim dilemma Evrnu, [which raised $15m in its Series B](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evrnu-raises-15m-series-b-financing-to-scale-its-nucycl-fiber-regeneration-technologies-301413279.html) investment round from its funders two years ago, works with garment collectors such as charities and distribution centres to get the initial clothing. Most of these garments would end up in rugs or insulation otherwise. Evrnu is partnering with Pangaia on a denim jacket made entirely from recycled cotton. Pangaia sells hoodies, jackets, shoes and T-shirts made with its own sustainable alternatives including seaweed, eucalyptus and grapes, as well as collaborating and investing in other textile start-ups similar to Evrnu. Pangaia wanted a product that was created from 100 per cent recycled material and could be 100 per cent recyclable. Designers chose denim, one of the most complicated and hardest to recycle textiles, largely because of the dying process. \"One of the beauties of denim is those dye molecules that chip off so you can see the white core,\" Flynn said. \"That's what makes denim so cool.\" Evrnu's fiber dyes more easily than traditional cotton, so it had to develop a method that would allow some of the color to fleck off while maintaining the integrity of the fabric. The collaboration created [20 Renu denim jackets](https://pangaia.com/pages/evrnu-renu-jacket) that were sold for [$400 each](https://pangaia.com/products/renu-jacket-dark-indigo-wash) on Panagia's website — a price Flynn that acknowledges is high. The clothing industry, she said, has been underpricing fashion for decades. \"Cheap product is way too expensive on the earth,\" she said. \"We as citizens have to pay for the fact that we're not calculating in the cost of the damage to natural resources or people.\" The company also has a [capsule collection](https://www.evrnu.com/case-studies/nucycl-x-zara) with fashion retailer Zara using its NuCycle technology. Flynn said Evrnu has half a billion dollars in volume commitments from brands and retailers (none of which are public yet). With scale, she said, the price of the recycled fabric will start to come down. \"We're starting to really train everyday consumers around the value of the things they put against their skin and to make better choices. Because if we're doing damage to the environment or humans, it's not worth it.\" This article originally appeared at [GreenBiz](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/cotton-has-waste-problem-startup-says-it-can-solve-it).

    "text": "Una serie de vídeos lanzados por VEI HABACHE, bajo el concepto SADBOI LOKO, invitarían a cuestionar, reflexionar y concienciar sobre el estado del sistema de salud en Puerto Rico.\nTres vídeos interconectados componen el proyecto del artista urbano emergente: el primero, difundido en redes sociales, fue un teaser de un cortometraje satírico, contado desde la perspectiva del psiquiatra Lorenzo Piovanetti, interpretado por el actor Juan Botta, que lanzó hoy, miércoles.\nPUBLICIDAD\n“Carlos [Maldonado] se inspiró de mis quejas”, contó VEI, conocido también como Héctor Javier Echevarría. “Cada vez que no podía ir al hospital, el procedimiento que era bien largo, me desmotivaba. Él, cien por ciento, lo cogió de ahí. Me acuerdo cuando me presentó la idea, que fue como ‘esto es todo lo que yo estoy pasando’”.\nEl corto, inspirado por experiencias personales del artista, presenta el lío que atraviesa Piovanetti, y las maniobras que propone hacer, para ofrecerle cuidado, terapia o medicamento a un paciente cuya identidad no se revela hasta el tercer vídeo del proyecto. Este último será el vídeo musical del nuevo sencillo de VEI, la nueva apuesta de la disquera RIMAS, según confirmaron sus portavoces a El Calce, que estará disponible el próximo 8 de julio.\nEl proyecto audiovisual, dirigido por Carlos Maldonado, denuncia la complejidad del sistema, que no tan solo impacta la salud mental, sino cualquier paciente con algún padecimiento que necesite atención médica especializada.\nLo que más lamenta el corto es cómo el paciente y el doctor fungen como piezas de un andamiaje mayor: “el reflejo de una burocracia”, describió el psiquiatra en el corto, cuyos últimos 30 segundos adelantan la música del próximo lanzamiento de VEI.\nMaldonado, fundador del colectivo EsoPega, también editó el corto; aunque algunas ideas quedaron fuera, la esencia del proyecto se mantuvo intacta.\nPUBLICIDAD\n“Yo lo que quiero mostrar es que mira, no soy ni tú ni yo. Es un sistema que nos tiene corrompidos”, explicó el creativo, quien aseguró que el formato de SADBOI LOKO también reta las normas de los vídeos musicales.\nSobre la propuesta, Maldonado afirmó que lo que busca es crear una discusión, tal como se formó en el adelanto del vídeo, al que asistieron alrededor de 20 personas allegadas al exponente.\nEn el caso de VEI, el arte y su música tuvo un impacto positivo en su salud mental, pese al estado de salud comprometido que soportó por meses.\n“[Cuando] estoy como sentimental, me pongo a escribir. Es lo que quisiera llevar a la gente, un poco de todo”, puntualizó HABACHE.",
