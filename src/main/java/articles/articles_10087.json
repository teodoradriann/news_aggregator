    "text": "Harris’s Desperate Smear Campaign Against Trump Gives Voters Even More Reasons To Back His Candidacy\nHarris goes down, Trump goes up: Go figure. Negativity doesn’t always work. Even in politics.\nIf President Trump is so bad, why are all these Democrats lining up to support him?\nVice President Harris takes a break from her basement campaign at the veep’s residence at Washington D.C. to call an emergency presser in order to put out the utterly despicable smear comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler.\nUtterly despicable.\n“Donald Trump is out for unchecked power. He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had, who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution,” she says.\nNot only is the charge despicable, it’s unproven.\nIt comes from a book written two years ago by the New York Times’ Peter Baker and the New Yorker’s Susan Glasser that quotes Trump’s erstwhile chief of staff, General John Kelly.\nYet while General Kelly keeps repeating the charge, no one has been able to actually corroborate it.\nGeneral Kelly is a tragic figure here, a patriotic retired Marine Corps general, who was dismissed by Trump and has been a source of incredible vitriol at Trump ever since then.\nI was in the Oval Office hundreds of times, and never heard Trump talk about Hitler or Nazi generals.\nWriting in the New York Post, Miranda Devine says the left has put a target on Trump’s back with these Nazi Adolf Hitler smears.\nIn other words, Ms. Harris could well be instigating yet another assassination attempt on Trump’s life.\nNow, I’m going to bet virtually the entire country knows that in the final days of what looks to be a losing campaign, Ms. Harris is absolutely desperate.\nYet desperation like this never pays off.\nEver since Trump walked down the escalator in Trump Tower more than nine years ago, Democrats have called him every name in the book.\nThey impeached him, then they impeached him again, he was never convicted.\nThey’ve tried to throw him in jail for 750 years.\nThey’ve tried to bankrupt him. They’ve tried to throw him off the ballot.\nOnly all the weaponized lawfare cases have fallen apart on appeal.\nRussia, Russia, Russia was a lot of baloney financed by Secretary Clinton.\nNow Ms. Harris is calling him a fascist, comparing him to Hitler, and claiming he’s “unhinged” and “unstable.”\nYet Trump is standing a lot taller than she is, right now.\nIn fact, his favorability has just surged to more than 50 percent in two recent polls from the Wall Street Journal and Gallup. More than 50 percent. He’s never been higher than 50 percent before. What does that tell you?\nSince last August, Team Kamala has spent $625 million on broadcast, cable, radio, and digital ads. Team Trump has only spent $378 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nMs. Harris has gone down. Trump has gone up. Go figure.\nNegativity doesn’t always work. Even in politics.\nAnd Trump is lengthening his lead on the issues.\nAccording to the Journal poll he’s now up12 points on the economy, up 15 points on immigration, up 15 points on the Middle East, and up 9 points on crime.\nOf course he is. The country does not want to re-elect the Biden-Harris administration.\nMs. Harris can’t talk issues — because nobody likes her issues.\nSo she calls pressers to throw mud at Trump, even though the mud is not sticking.\nBy the way, fittingly, she didn’t even answer questions from the press at her own press conference.\nFinally, just consider this for a moment.\nMs. Harris is smearing Trump with Hitler, so what is she going to do about this growing gaggle of Democrats running for the Senate, who have favorably mentioned Trump in their own ads against Republicans?\nIt’s a laundry list: Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, Jon Tester in Montana.\nThey’ve all put Trump in their ads. These are positive — not negative — ads about Trump.\nNot to mention, by the way, the likes of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard standing just last night on stage embracing Trump.\nSo does that mean they’re complicit with Ms. Harris’s Nazi smear?\nWith her fascist smear?\nWith her Trump derangement syndrome personal hate campaign against Trump?\nPretty soon half the Democrats running for the senate are going to be backing Trump.\nNow, I wouldn’t necessarily believe them, but it’s pretty clear they’re not paying any attention to Ms. Harris, or her despicable smear campaign.\nWhich, like the weaponized lawfare jihad, has probably given voters even more reason to vote Trump.\nFrom Mr. Kudlow’s broadcast on Fox Business Network.",

    "text": "La statua della Madonna di Trevignano chiusa in un magazzino, Suor Paola: “Datela a me”\nPubblicato il 29 Marzo 2024 - 15:55\nSuor Paola, proprio lei, vorrebbe prendersi la statua della Madonna di Trevignano. Tutto vero. La Madonna, alta un metro e ottanta, dopo le ultime vicende per mesi è rimasta chiusa in un magazzino, fino a quando due settimane fa un ex adepto che aveva donato la statua alla quasi veggente di Trevignano, Luigi Avella, è riuscito a rientrarne in possesso.\nE ora che fine farà? Suor Paola, racconta a Repubblica, ha provato a chiederla: “Quando ho saputo che c’era questa Madonna in un magazzino mi sono fatta dare il numero di Avella e l’ho chiamato: ‘Adesso te la ridanno’, gli ho detto, ‘dove la metti?’ Se vuoi ci terrei ad avere la Madonnina. Io la volevo prendere perché amo molto la Madonna. Vado a Lourdes una volta all’anno, sono un’ammiratrice della Madonna. L’avrei messa a Roma, in via dè Iacovacci, dove stiamo costruendo una struttura per gli anziani. L’avrei presa per loro e per farli pregare”. Ma alla Madonna chiederebbe un miracolo per la Lazio? “Neanche c’ho pensato. La Lazio è un gioco, la Madonna è una cosa seria”.",

    "title": "Hellenistic cult site found near underground river in Italy - The Jerusalem Post",
    "text": "Archaeologists completed an excavation mission within the Pertosa-Auletta Cave in southern Italy, unearthing an ancient Greek sanctuary identified as a cultic structure from the Hellenistic period. The discovery confirms the historical significance of the site and suggests it served as a gathering place for a Hellenistic cult during the 4th to 1st centuries BCE, according to GreekReporter.com.\nLocated in the Cilento mountain range within the Alburni geological park in the province of Salerno, the Pertosa-Auletta Cave revealed a sacred area along its underground waterway. Among the objects found was a small bowl used for incense burning, indicative of cult ceremonies during the Hellenistic period . This artifact suggests that ritual practices were conducted within the cave, shedding light on religious activities during that era.\nExperts propose that the cave may have been used for ritual offerings, purification ceremonies, or oracle practices, paralleling other subterranean sanctuaries in the Greek world. Despite the sanctuary dating between the 4th and 1st centuries BCE, it has not been determined from which type of cult the remnants in the Pertosa-Auletta Cave stem.\nThe archaeological excavation, which began in late January 2025, focused on the cave's entrance area, where researchers explored sections along Italy's only navigable underground river. To facilitate their work, the underground river was dammed, allowing for an examination of the underlying riverbed, according to Popular Mechanics. Approximately 130 feet from the cave's entrance, archaeologists spent weeks sifting through the newly revealed, mud-sodden riverbed.\nWhile investigating the site, researchers studied an ancient wooden village discovered last year within the Pertosa-Auletta Cave. This wooden village, built on stilts, is considered unique in Europe due to its underground location. New evidence suggests that the platform of the village is larger and more complex than previously believed, with extensions revealing greater structural complexity.\nTo determine the exact age of the village and understand how the wooden structures have survived for centuries, researchers collected wood samples for laboratory testing.\nThe excavations were conducted by the MIdA Foundation in collaboration with the Superintendency of Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Landscape of Salerno and Avellino. The project included contributions from the Enzo dei Medici Speleological-Archaeological Research Center. Additional support came from Iren S.p.A. and the municipalities of Pertosa and Auletta, who provided logistical and technical assistance.\nThe article was written with the assistance of a news analysis system.",
