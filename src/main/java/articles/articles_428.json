    "text": "COLUMBIA — University of Missouri researchers have developed a liquid-based solution that eliminates more than 98% of microscopic plastic particles in water.\nMicroplastics are plastic particles ranging in size from 5 millimeters, which is about the size of a pencil eraser, to 1 nanometer, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency . For context, a strand of human hair is about 80,000 nanometers wide — that means a strand of hair is 80,000 times wider than the smallest sized microplastic.\nWater-repellent solvent separates from water, trapping microplastics in its molecular structure\nSiobhan Harms, KOMU 8 Reporter “Our technology is basically a liquid film, so it absorbs the microplastics in its own liquid environment, and then phase separates that from the water,\" said Gary Baker, an associate professor of chemistry at MU.\nThe liquid-based solution is a solvent made from natural ingredients. When mixed with water, the solvent acts similar to oil by floating back up to the surface. But, on its way up, the solvent carries the microplastics within its molecular structure.\n“You can, in principle, reuse that, extract the microplastics from it and recycle it to use it again,” Baker said.\nBaker said researchers across the country have been exploring different ways to address the issues that arise from microplastics.\nSuccess!

Carmelo Cortés, presidente del Comité de Empresa, asegura que aunque hay prevista una reunión mañana, los sindicatos han iniciado ya el procedimiento para ir a la huelga.\nCortés asegura que el comité de empresa ha solicitado a Valoriza que firme por escrito, todos los compromisos a los que llega con los trabajadores.

    "title": "First-Time Dad Hosts Meetup With Other Fathers After Admitting That He Felt 'Isolated' As A New Dad",
    "text": "First-Time Dad Hosts Meetup With Other Fathers After Admitting That He Felt 'Isolated' As A New Dad\nThe turnout ended up being more than he imagined.\nWe rarely hear from first-time dads about their transition into parenthood. Most of the time, it's common for new mothers to be offered support, community, and room to open up about the stresses and obstacles of motherhood, but just as moms can become overwhelmed and feel lonely, the same can be said for dads.\nThis is why a Brooklyn-based content creator and new dad named Joe Gonzales decided to actually do something about the lack of support by sharing his experience on TikTok. He decided to put out a bit of a rallying cry to other new dads in the New York City/Brooklyn area, encouraging a sense of community to help with those feelings of isolation.\nThe new dad hosted a meetup with other fathers after admitting he felt 'isolated.'\n\"If you're a dad or you know a dad in Brooklyn. My name is Joe, I'm a dad myself, and this Saturday at 1 p.m. in McCarren Park, I'm hosting a meetup for dads, so if you're interested, come through,\" Gonzales said, pointing viewers to a link in his bio that had more information.\nHe encouraged dads to come if they wanted to connect with other dads to form a sense of community.\nThe dad was nervous no one would show up for the event, but he was sorely mistaken.\nSharing photos from the event that took place on October 19, the turnout was quite amazing. Gonzales admitted that before the meetup, he was nervous that no one would show up but was genuinely surprised by the number of dads who did. \"I really believe in this generation of dads we are learning and breaking the mold of what we have experienced.\"\nGonzales admitted that he had been feeling \"isolated\" in his new routine and didn't have many friends in the city. To solve this problem, he chose to put himself out there by setting a date.\nIn an interview with People, Gonzales admitted that he was going to make this a routine meetup, calling it the Brooklyn Stroll Club. He told the publication that \"almost 20 first-time dads from all over New York\" showed up and \"shared stories on what it's been like [being parents].\"\nWith five months of fatherhood under his belt, Gonzales credited his own dad and his friend Aaron with preparing him for the sudden shift from having no children to welcoming a son. \"My friend Aaron is the most intentional person I know. I see it with his family but also with himself and others. He has inspired me to be a loving, present father to my son but also be intentional to the people around me. Having a son has [shown] me that I’m a constant example for him, and Aaron has been a great example for me.\"\nHe continued, \"Posting these recap photos on TikTok made me even more surprised because I’ve had so many parents from all over saying how much they wish they could have something like this and how it heals their inner child seeing dads getting together. I have had so many dads in my comments reaching out saying that they want to be at the next one, and the dads that came have been so encouraging about it.\"\nA majority of new dads often experience symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety.\nJust like moms experience periods of anxiety and depression after giving birth, the same happens to dads as they transition into fatherhood. Of course, this is not to say that men's postpartum depression and anxiety outweighs a woman's, but it does exist.\nA 2021 study showed that 1 in 10 men experience prenatal and postpartum anxiety. In a similar survey by Parents and Verywell Mind who partnered to survey 1,600 Dads in the U.S. to find out how dads are feeling, a concerning picture of the state of dad's mental health was painted.\nFindings indicated that many dads are hurting and need more support. When it comes to mental health, many fathers are struggling. Of those surveyed, 2 in 3 dads said they have been at least moderately stressed in the last 30 days, and 43% of dads say at least half their stress is related to child care, with 62% saying the pressure to provide for their family is a major stressor.\nNearly 83% of respondents say they prioritize their family’s needs over their own. At the same time, 59% of responding dads say they do more childcare and/or parenting than they get credit for.\nIt's why, just like mothers, fathers need a sense of community among their peers because there's nothing worse than feeling as if you're alone in your mental health struggles.\nHaving meetups in parks with other dads, grabbing coffee with the dads in your lives, or even reaching out for professional help can make the difference between feeling like you're drowning and finding your footing as a parent. It's why more dads like Gonzales should be encouraging a sense of community among peers because the results are far reaching.\nNia Tipton is a staff writer with a bachelor’s degree in creative writing and journalism who covers news and lifestyle topics that focus on psychology, relationships, and the human experience.",

    "text": "TikTok ha reforzado sus herramientas de control parental, buscando que los padres reciban avisos automáticos cuando sus hijos adolescentes publiquen nuevos contenidos. Esta actualización permite también bloquear cuentas específicas para impedir el acceso a ciertos perfiles, reforzando la supervisión y seguridad en la plataforma. La iniciativa se suma a las mejoras destinadas a mejorar la experiencia tanto para familias como para creadores de contenido.\nDentro de las funciones ampliadas de la herramienta Sincronización Familiar, los padres podrán recibir notificaciones cuando sus hijos suban vídeos, historias o fotos visibles a otros usuarios. Además, podrán ser alertados sobre cambios en la privacidad de la cuenta, como la habilitación de descargas o modificaciones en la visibilidad de seguidores, permitiendo un control más cercano y actualizado sobre la actividad digital de los adolescentes.\nNuevas funcionalidades para padres en TikTok\nLos padres también podrán bloquear cuentas específicas para que sus hijos no accedan a contenidos no deseados. Si los adolescentes desean cambiar esta restricción, podrán enviar una solicitud para desbloquear dichas cuentas, facilitando un diálogo supervisado entre padres e hijos. Esta medida complementa la función de notificación cuando un menor reporta un vídeo inapropiado, fortaleciendo la protección familiar en TikTok.\nAdemás, TikTok brinda acceso a la herramienta “Gestionar Temas” para que los padres ajusten la frecuencia con la que se recomiendan ciertos temas populares en el feed de sus hijos. Desde el perfil de Sincronización Familiar, podrán verificar con qué frecuencia el menor elige contenidos relacionados, haciendo posible una orientación temática más precisa y adaptada a las preferencias y seguridad del adolescente.\nHerramientas de bienestar y apoyo para usuarios\nCon el objetivo de fomentar hábitos digitales saludables, TikTok ha lanzado las “Misiones de Bienestar“, que consisten en pequeñas tareas atractivas diseñadas para promover comportamientos conscientes en el manejo del tiempo en la app. Los usuarios que completan estas misiones obtienen insignias, incentivando la creación de una relación equilibrada con la plataforma.\nAdemás, en pruebas recientes, casi un 40% de participantes exploraron esta función de forma espontánea, mostrando un interés significativo. TikTok también explora crear una función que reúna herramientas de apoyo holístico, pistas de audio relajantes y control del tiempo de pantalla.\nProtección ampliada para creadores de contenido\nPara los creadores, TikTok ha añadido funciones como el “Modo de Cuidado de Creadores” que filtra comentarios ofensivos y no deseados. También permite silenciar palabras, frases o emojis durante transmisiones en vivo, otorgando mayor control y tranquilidad sobre la interacción en directo.\nLa función de “Revisión de Contenido” facilita a los creadores evaluar si sus vídeos cumplen con las normas antes de publicarlos, mientras que herramientas como la Bandeja de entrada y la Sala de chat permiten gestionar mensajes y conectar con seguidores, respetando la edad mínima de 18 años para su uso. La plataforma ofrece además la Academia de creadores para profundizar en las Normas de la Comunidad y buenas prácticas.",

    "text": "Tombstone aimed true, past genre and categorical limitations. It had crossover appeal, offering something most Westerns couldn’t give ’90s audiences. To this day, it comes up in any conversation when discussing the best cowboy movies. Thirty years later, the film still holds its spot tightly and has a small air of mystique surrounding the production. The film isn’t the epitome of historical accuracy in any way, but involves many of the actual events leading up to that famous shootout at the O.K. Corral and Wyatt Earp’s Vendetta Ride. Some events are simplified or condensed, while a few gaps had to be filled in with fictional outcomes that help bring the characters back together. The original script was also much longer and many scenes had to be cut or trimmed down. Still, the narrative we received was amazing, with fleshed-out characters, emotional arcs, and some incredible dialog. What may be the film’s ultimate asset is the impressive ensemble cast. Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer playing Doc Holliday are the two roles everyone remembers the most from this film, which is deserved after all of the prep both men did for the parts, but there isn’t a weak performance in the entire film. Those two acted against Powers Boothe, who portrayed Curly Bill, and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo, with equally magnificent showings. All these characters are human, their motivations realized and made manifest. No one is perfect, with even Wyatt being shown to make mistakes, be selfish, and cheat. The list of notable people in Tombstone is massive. There aren’t many other movies with a laundry list of talent like this. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton play the other Earp brothers, Stephen Lang, Thomas Haden Church, and Jason Priestley ride with the outlaw gang, while other performers like Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Billy Zane, and Terry O’Quinn all help round out important figures in the story. It’s a stellar pool of actors all turning in great work, and even those with only a couple of scenes stand out. There were problems behind the camera, however. The film was written by Kevin Jarre, who was also originally going to direct, but he was fired after only a month on set. George P. Cosmatos (Cobra, Rambo: First Blood Part II) was brought in to take up the reigns, but how good of a fit he was for the production is up for some debate. According to most accounts, Russell actually took on many of the directing responsibilities so that the film stayed on schedule and didn’t go over budget. He even continued to help once Cosmatos was there, to ensure the project kept the feel and tone they wanted. This has been mentioned by others, but Russell himself doesn’t discuss it , apparently due to a promise he made. What does seem certain is that if he hadn’t been there, Tombstone wouldn’t have made it to the screen, or at least not in the state we saw it Several other actors almost starred in the picture, some of which were studio decisions or initial conditions for the financing before everything was worked out. After his performance in Pretty Woman, Richard Gere was considered for the role of Wyatt, while Mickey Rourke turned down the chance to play Johnny Ringo. Willem Dafoe was originally set to take on the character of Doc Holliday, but the studio wanted a bigger name. Jennifer Connelly tried out for the part of Josephine Marcus; Lisa Zane was also considered for that role and Kate as well. A personal favorite rumor from the film is that legendary director John Carpenter was approached to helm it. The movie is also gorgeous, just wonderful cinematography and costuming. The shoot wasn’t an easy one, as the cast and crew had to deal with extreme heat and scorpions while filming out in Arizona, but a few of those shots are just superb. The art department did their best to use historically accurate clothes, saddles, guns, and even the wallpaper, while they had one of Wyatt Earp’s actual descendants in the movie as well as Old West actors. There was also more filmed than what we’ve seen. There are about six minutes worth of scenes included in various releases of the movie, but there were more filmed, a few shots of which can be seen in certain trailers . Tombstone has a solid gold legacy. It broke the mold of Western movies at that time, and resonated with harsher ’90s audiences. That’s true for the actors, too, as many who worked on the film still speak of the movie as a great experience; Kilmer even titled his memoir, “I’m Your Huckleberry.” Just like the story it’s based on, this epic stands the test of time and proves there’s still some fight left in it.

    "text": "[El desesperado pedido de Justicia tras el crimen de Paloma y Josué en Florencio Varela: “Muchos más casos no salen a la luz”Opens in new window ]\nEl 17 de febrero pasado detuvieron a Gonzalo Andrés López por el crimen de Paloma y Josué, los novios asesinados a finales de enero en Florencio Varela. Tras estar casi dos meses tras las rejas, la Cámara de Apelación y Garantías de Quilmes decidió terminar con la prisión preventiva.\nMirá También: Se quebró el único detenido por el asesinato de Paloma y Josué en Florencia Varela: qué declaró el acusado del crimen\nLa teoría del secuestro de Gonzalo López por el crimen de Paloma y Josué en Florencio Varela\nEn un principio había sido detenido ya que la Justicia sospechaba que estaba encubriendo a los responsables del hecho. Esto debido a que se chequeó que su celular tenía el mismo número IMEI que el de una de las víctimas.\nTras un informe hecho por Telecom, se pudo verificar que los números estaban clonados. Por lo que el Samsung A02 de Josué Salvatierra era el duplicado, mientras que el de Gonzalo, comprado en Roca y de color azul, era el original.\nLa hipótesis por la que Gonzalo fue llevado a prisión, sostenida por el fiscal Darío Provisionato, consistía en que alguien llevó el dispositivo de Josué a Río Negro después de que los matarán. Además, como el imputado cursó un año de la carrera de analista programador, levantó las sospechas para que quede detenido en primer lugar.\nMirá También: “Extraño el beso que me daba antes de ir a dormir”: el desgarrador testimonio del papa de Josué, el nene que fue asesinado junto a su amiga Paloma\nLa declaración de Gonzalo Andrés López\nUn mes atrás, el 7 de marzo, López declaró que no tenía vínculo alguno con lo ocurrido. Adquirió su dispositivo por Facebook, mucho antes del crimen, y lo mantuvo apagado hasta agosto.\nEntonces, a partir de la nueva información, su defensa está llevando a cabo el pedido de sobreseimiento para que quede fuera del caso completamente.\nSin embargo, no es lo único que se supo estos días. Se descubrió que el padre de Paloma, Omar Gallardo, tiene otra hija y una exesposa que viven en General Roca, donde se encontró el celular clonado.",

    "text": "La capital almeriense ha acogido en la tarde de este viernes la cabalgata de los Reyes Magos, en la que se ha disfrutado de teatro, música y una lluvia de 13.000 kilos de caramelos que se han repartido desde 13 carrozas con motivos infantiles tradicionales. La estancia de Melchor, Gaspar y Baltasar en Almería ha comenzado por la mañana, con visita al Teatro Apolo, la residencia de mayores Santa Teresa de Jornet y los pequeños ingresados en el Hospital Universitario Torrecárdenas, y ha continuado esta tarde con salida desde la Alcazaba, para llegar al Ayuntamiento y saludar desde el balcón de la Plaza Vieja, y, a las 19,00 horas, han comenzado la Cabalgata, el momento más esperado, que les ha paseado por Obispo Orberá, Paseo de Almería y Avenida Federico García Lorca, según ha recogido el Consistorio en un comunicado. La magia la han proporcionado los Magos de Oriente, que han repartido 13.000 kilos de caramelos aptos para todos, pero la espectacularidad ha llegado de la mano de los cinco espectáculos internacionales, procedentes de compañías de Francia, Bélgica, Italia y España. Los belgas 'Theater Tol' han mostrado el bello 'Pedaleando hasta el cielo', con once actores y actrices, con globos, bailarinas y música. Visualmente muy atractivo, son ángeles gigantes, suspendidos en el cielo por globos, que desplegaban unas armoniosas coreografías y han traído la nieve al centro de la ciudad. Con la boca abierta miraban, absortos, niños y mayores. Los italianos 'Accademia Creativa' han presentado 'Farfalle', unas mariposas luminosas que se pasean por las calles con la técnica de los zancos, realizando una danza y acompañadas de hombres LED. De Francia han llegado para sumarse a la Cabalgata de los Reyes Magos la compañía 'Inko'nito, y sus espectáculos 'Celeste' y 'Sélénites'. El primero es un hinchable que llega hasta los nueve metros y se titula 'Celeste'. Un personaje articulado y luminoso, que ha hecho las delicias de los más pequeños. Y el segundo, 'Sélénites', es otro hinchable gigante que ha estado interactuando con los miles de almerienses que han arropado la Cabalgata. Por último, los españoles HIdrocampus Eventos Artísticos han acompañado a Sus Majestades con 'Las Superheroínas', divertidos personajes con música, que también han sido muy aplaudidos. Junto a los espectáculos, un séquito de 500 personas y trece carrozas, entre ellas el Tren de la Navidad, Correos, Pinocho, El Mago de Oz, Cenicienta, el Portal de Belén, La estrella de Oriente, Peppa Pig y la del Carbón. La música la han traído las agrupaciones musicales Banda Municipal de Almería, Banda Santa Cruz, Banda de la Agrupación Musical San Indalecio y Banda del Carmen.

    "text": "Playing fetch is part and parcel of a dog's life - but now scientists have found many cats enjoy it just as much. A first-of-its-kind survey of 1,000 cat owners has thrown up new information about feline play habits. Academics at Sussex and Northumbria universities said the findings suggest owners should keep an open mind about the stimulation their cats might respond to. The research was first published in the science journal Nature. Many cats instinctively like to play, the report says, and owners are being urged to think more about the types of activities they could do to keep their pets happy and active. It found cats generally prefer to be in control of the game and do not require training to play. The survey gathered information from 924 owners of 1,154 cats (994 mixed-breed and 160 purebred) that play fetch Jemma Forman, a doctoral researcher at the University of Sussex School of Psychology, said: \"Cats who initiated their fetching sessions played more enthusiastically with more retrievals and more fetching sessions per month. \"This perceived sense of control from the cat's perspective may be beneficial for the cat's welfare and the cat-owner relationship. \"I'd encourage owners to be receptive to the needs of their cat by responding to their preferences for play - not all cats will want to play fetch, but if they do, it's likely that they will have their own particular way of doing so.\" The survey gathered information from 924 owners of 1,154 cats (994 mixed-breed and 160 purebred) that play fetch to better understand the behaviour. The vast majority of cats (94.4%) showed an instinctive ability to play fetch from a young age, whether it was retrieving toys or common household items. The Siamese was the most reported (22.5%) purebred to play fetch, followed by Bengal (10%) and Ragdoll (7.5%). Study co-author Dr Elizabeth Renner, a lecturer in psychology at Northumbria University, said: \"We think it's important because it demonstrates how much this behaviour is led by cats themselves, since very few of the owners surveyed explicitly trained their cats to fetch.\" (bbc)",
