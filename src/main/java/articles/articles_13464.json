    "text": "Kelsey McGuire has built Philadelphia Blind Hockey from the ground level.\nPHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A Horsham, Pennsylvania, native is making hockey more accessible for the visually impaired.\nIn 2022, Kelsey McGuire founded Philadelphia Blind Hockey, the first and only blind hockey team in Philadelphia.\nCombining her background as a teacher of the visually impaired with her favorite sport, hockey became accessible to everyone. She trains all the coaches to understand each child's needs so they have the tools to make their experience seamless.\n\"This is how we accommodate this. This is how you're going to describe this skill, this drill,\" McGuire explains. \"So then they have a better idea of how to picture what they need to be doing, what their feet should feel like, where their body, where their head, where their shoulders need to be to be able to get them all up and moving.\"\nMissy Jones' son, Isaac, is a hockey player in the program. She feels so much joy when Isaac takes the ice.\n\"His coaches understand how to direct him based on things he'll understand,\" Jones said. \"It's been really great to see that he can excel at something, and feel good about himself, and build that confidence.\"\nMcGuire has built this program from the ground level. It's been a labor of love as she watches these athletes grow and evolve.\n\"It's a cool experience because all these kids have never skated before a day in their life,\" McGuire reflected. \"So to see them be so scared and wobbling all over the place, now they're doing drills, practicing. It's so cool to see in a short three years that huge change and difference.\"\nPhiladelphia Blind Hockey has become a community where kids and their families feel embraced.\n\"It's so nice because everyone has the same kind of baseline of understanding,\" Jones said. \"Our kids have some challenges, but we all want our kids to try, and do their best, and they don't have to be held back because of their challenges.\"\nThe program is set to compete for the first time this week at the Canadian National Blind Hockey Tournament. It's a milestone for Philadelphia Blind Hockey.",

    "text": "Uttar Pradesh has become the first state in the country to meet the highest demand for electricity, according to information provided by Union power minister RK Singh in response to a question raised in the Rajya Sabha. In the period from April 2023 to November 2023, Uttar Pradesh achieved the highest supply of 28,284 MW securing the top position in the country. The state’s energy and urban development minister AK Sharma shared this accomplishment on social media here on Thursday, expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath.“Uttar Pradesh surpassed Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan to claim the top spot, demonstrating a remarkable increase in electricity supply,” Sharma said highlighting the state’s commitment to providing even better electricity with new production capacity.UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma said the demand in 2024-25 might cross 30,000 MW. “The energy corporations need to upgrade their distribution and transmission systems in advance to avoid any repeat of the grim situation that consumers faced during last summer despite meeting record demand,” he said.",

    "text": "Montana Creates Emergency ‘Drive-Through’ Blood Pickups for Rural Ambulances Given driving distances in the vast state, trauma cases are sometimes transported for more than an hour. One physician compares the first-in-the-nation service to fast-food drive-throughs. Crystal Hiwalker wonders if her heart and lungs would have kept working if the ambulance crew had been able to give her a transfusion as the blood drained from her body during a stormy, 100-mile ride. Because of the 2019 snowstorm, it took 2.5 hours to drive from her small town of Lame Deer, Montana, to the advanced trauma center in Billings. Doctors at the Billings Clinic hospital revived Hiwalker and stopped the bleeding from her ruptured ectopic pregnancy. They were shocked that she not only survived after her heart stopped beating and she lost nearly all her blood, but that she recovered without brain damage. The Montana State Trauma Care Committee, which works to reduce trauma incidents and to improve care, later realized the ambulance that carried Hiwalker had passed near two hospitals that stocked blood. What if Hiwalker had access to that blood on her way to Billings, committee members asked. That realization, and question, inspired committee members to create the Montana Interfacility Blood Network, which they say is the first program of its kind in the U.S. The network allows ambulance crews to pick up blood from hospitals and transfuse it to patients on the way to the advanced care they need. “We kind of came up with the idea of having a blood handoff — like driving through a fast-food restaurant drive-thru — and picking up blood on the way,” said Gordon Riha, a trauma surgeon at the Billings Clinic trauma center, where Hiwalker was treated. Riha said timely blood transfusions can prevent death or permanent brain injury. The network is aimed at rural patients, who “We have to get more creative. We don’t have a blood bank on every corner, and we don’t have a Level 1 trauma center on every corner,” Johnson said. Network leaders say the program has helped at least three patients since it launched in 2022. They hope it will be used more in the future. Hiwalker is excited about the program. “I’m so glad that something like this got started, because it would save a lot of lives from where I live,” she said. Hiwalker said she has heard about people bleeding to death after car crashes, gunshot wounds, and stabbings in her rural community. Johnson said work injuries, cancer, gastrointestinal problems, and childbirth can also cause serious bleeding. The Montana trauma committee began discussing the blood network a few months after Hiwalker’s brush with death. First, it The network is used only during emergencies, which means there’s no time to test patients’ blood types. So it uses only type O red blood cells, which can be transfused safely into most patients. The receiving hospital — not the one that provided the blood — is responsible for billing patients’ insurance for the blood. The cost depends on how much blood patients need but typically ranges from several hundred dollars to more than a thousand, said Sadie Arnold, who manages the blood bank at Billings Clinic. Arnold said blood must be stored in a lab and managed by professionals with specific degrees, clinical experience, and board certifications. Some rural hospitals lack space for a lab or money to recruit these specialists, Arnold said. Or they may not need blood often enough to justify storing a product that can expire and — especially during the current national Rural hospitals that do store blood may have only small amounts on hand. A rural Montanan with severe bleeding experienced that firsthand when he went to the nearest hospital, which had only one unit of type O blood, according to a Ideally, rural patients with serious bleeding would be transported by medical helicopters or airplanes outfitted for transfusions. But, as in Hiwalker’s case, flying can be impossible during bad weather. That can mean hours-long ambulance rides. Some towns in northeastern Montana, for example, are more than 250 miles away from the nearest advanced trauma center. “This was truly designed for kind of that last-ditch effort,” Johnson said. When “we’re out of options, we’ve got to get the patient moving towards a larger center, and we can’t fly.” The blood handoff may involve the ambulance stopping at the second hospital, Johnson said. But during one incident, a police officer picked up the blood and delivered it to the ambulance at a highway exit, she said. Ambulances may also pick up a paramedic or nurse to provide the transfusion along the way, since many rural ambulance crews are staffed by emergency medical technicians, who in Montana aren’t authorized to do so. Medics in other cities and states, She said researchers are also interested in the potential of using frozen and freeze-dried blood products, which could be helpful in rural areas since they’re easier to store and have longer shelf lives. Johnson said the Montana Interfacility Blood Network is the only program she knows of specifically aimed at rural patients and involving ambulances picking up blood from hospitals along their routes. She said the network is gaining interest from other states with large rural regions, including Oregon. Hiwalker said receiving a blood transfusion in the ambulance could have prevented her near-death experience and the trauma her husband faced from seeing her suffer as he rode in the ambulance with her. She’s glad her ordeal led to an innovation that is helping others. ( ©2024 KFF Health News. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

First, it [created a map](https://dphhs.mt.gov/assets/publichealth/EMSTS/Trauma/BloodSiteMap.pdf)of 48 facilities with blood banks. Then, it [created guidelines](https://dphhs.mt.gov/assets/publichealth/EMSTS/Trauma/LaboratoryGuideforBloodTransport.pdf)for how hospitals, blood banks, ambulances, and labs must communicate about, package, transport, document, and bill for the blood.

The network uses blood that has a maximum shelf life of 42 days. Rural hospitals that do store blood may have only small amounts on hand. A rural Montanan with severe bleeding experienced that firsthand when he went to the nearest hospital, which had only one unit of type O blood, according to a [report on the blood network](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10961070/). But thanks to the new program, ambulance medics picked up more blood from a hospital halfway through an 80-mile drive to the trauma hospital.
