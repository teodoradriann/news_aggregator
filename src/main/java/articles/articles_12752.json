    "text": "Digital Heart Care in Hawke’s Bay Slashes Hospital Visits, Boosts Patient Outcomes\nHealth Minister Simeon Brown announced the success of the programme this week, emphasising that it represents a shift toward practical, patient-centred healthcare.\n- Country:\n- New Zealand\nA groundbreaking digital model of care is revolutionising the treatment of heart failure in Hawke’s Bay, dramatically improving health outcomes and reducing pressure on hospitals. The new remote patient monitoring system, backed by the Government, is being hailed as a smart, patient-first solution that blends technology with personalised medical care.\nTransforming Heart Failure Management\nHealth Minister Simeon Brown announced the success of the programme this week, emphasising that it represents a shift toward practical, patient-centred healthcare. The model targets people living with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)—a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to fatigue, fluid build-up, and serious health complications.\n“A core part of managing this condition is careful medication titration—slowly adjusting medications to the right levels based on each patient’s response,” Mr Brown explained. “Traditionally, this required frequent face-to-face appointments and could take six to nine months to complete. Now, it can be done safely and efficiently from home.”\nHow the Digital Care Model Works\nUnder the new model, patients are equipped with hospital-provided remote monitoring kits that include:\n-\nA tablet for video consultations\n-\nA digital scale to track fluid retention\n-\nA blood pressure cuff and pulse oximeter to monitor vital signs\nPatients check their health metrics daily from home and attend regular virtual appointments with clinicians, who can remotely assess their condition and adjust medication as needed.\n“This model eliminates the need for patients to repeatedly travel to hospital clinics for check-ups or medication changes,” said Brown. “Instead, they receive high-quality, frequent monitoring from the comfort of their own homes.”\nImpressive Results Already Achieved\nEarly results from the Hawke’s Bay rollout are promising and suggest major gains in both health outcomes and system efficiency:\n-\nHospital readmissions within 30 days dropped to zero, down from a previous rate of 25%.\n-\nMissed appointments have been eliminated, compared to a former 15.3% no-show rate.\n-\nMedication titration is now completed in just 6 to 8 weeks, a huge improvement on the 6 to 8 months it once took.\n-\nClinicians now have greater capacity, allowing more patients to receive timely care and attention.\n“This programme is delivering more care, closer to home,” Brown said. “Patients are benefitting from early intervention, fewer hospital visits, and more personalised support.”\nA Win for Rural and Remote Communities\nThe digital care model is particularly beneficial for people living in rural or remote parts of Hawke’s Bay, who often face long travel times and limited access to regular healthcare services.\n“By embracing this model, we’re helping to remove barriers to care,” said Brown. “Instead of being dependent on geography or transport availability, patients can now receive consistent, expert care without needing to leave home.”\nA Model for National Expansion\nWith clear evidence of success, the Hawke’s Bay model could serve as a blueprint for digital heart failure care across the country. As health services nationwide face increasing demand, the Government sees the integration of digital health solutions as essential to building a more sustainable, efficient system.\n“This is exactly the kind of smart, modern solution we need in our healthcare system,” Brown said. “It’s faster, safer, and more effective—not just for patients, but for clinicians too. We’re not just improving outcomes, we’re transforming lives.”\nLooking Ahead\nThe success in Hawke’s Bay is already sparking interest from other districts and health providers looking to replicate the model. As New Zealand continues to invest in healthcare innovation, programmes like this offer a glimpse of the future—where technology and human care work hand-in-hand to deliver better health for all.",

    "text": "Skylight, a decentralized short-form video app built on the AT Protocol, is now live on iOS, with an Android beta available on Google Play. Backed by Mark Cuban and the Graham & Walker Venture Fund, the app offers familiar TikTok-style features — editing tools, likes, comments, shares, and user profiles — but with a key difference: interoperability. Posts created in Skylight can be viewed and engaged with across ATProto-based platforms, including Bluesky and Flashes.\nMore importantly, by leveraging the AT Protocol, Skylight is nearly impossible to ban or shut down — a significant advantage as regulators around the world scrutinize centralized platforms.\nFounders Tori White and Reed Harmeyer were motivated by the potential TikTok ban in the US. White, a former influencer, had archived her content and recognized the need for a more resilient platform. She used her TikTok account (@buildwithtori) to document Skylight’s development, generating awareness and attracting a base of early adopters.\nSkylight currently supports videos up to three minutes long and has a roadmap that includes duets, stitches, playlists, and customizable feeds.\nThis is not just another TikTok clone. Skylight is the first short-form video app to integrate directly with Bluesky’s 33.8 million-user network, offering creators the ability to publish content across a decentralized, interoperable ecosystem. As Meta, YouTube, and TikTok continue to expand their closed networks, Skylight represents a different architectural vision. Whether it gains traction remains to be seen, but the timing, protocol, and positioning reflect a growing demand for open, creator-first platforms.\nAs always your thoughts and comments are both welcome and encouraged.

    "text": "Why 'Hafiz Saeed Extradition' Request Is Another Modi Government Masterstroke Against Pakistan? It comes at a crucial juncture when Pakistan is striving to enhance its global image and distance itself from the tag of a \"terror haven.\" Trending Photos NEW DELHI: In a significant move, the Government of India has formally requested Pakistan to extradite Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, confirmed the request during a press briefing on Friday, emphasizing Saeed's status as a UN-proscribed terrorist wanted in numerous cases in India. ''The person in question is wanted in numerous cases in India. He is also a UN-proscribed terrorist. In this regard, we have conveyed a request along with relevant supporting documents to the Government of Pakistan to extradite him to India to face trial in a particular case. We have been flagging the issue of activities, that he's been wanted for. This is a recent request...\" MEA Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. A Modi Govt Masterstroke? This extradition request is strategically timed, marking another masterstroke by the Narendra Modi government. It comes at a crucial juncture when Pakistan is striving to enhance its global image and distance itself from the tag of a \"terror haven.\" The move adds pressure on Pakistan, emphasizing India's commitment to addressing cross-border terrorism. Pak Leaders Acknowledge India's Global Prowess The extradition request coincides with former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's recognition of India's growing global influence and technological advancements. Sharif, speaking to members of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), drew a sharp contrast between India's achievements, including lunar exploration, and Pakistan's economic challenges. Pakistan's Economic Struggles Sharif lamented Pakistan's economic challenges, acknowledging the responsibility for the nation's struggles lies within. The former Prime Minister emphasized the need for internal reforms and acknowledged India's advancements in various fields. Hafiz Saeed: Legal Battles Hafiz Saeed, aged 71, has faced legal repercussions in Pakistan, including a 33-year jail sentence in April 2022 for terror financing. Despite these convictions, he has managed to evade punishment for his involvement in the 26/11 terror attacks. India's extradition request comes amid concerns over his continued influence, especially with his son, Hafiz Talha Saeed, entering the political arena. Political Implications Ahead Of Pakistan Elections The extradition request gains significance as Hafiz Talha Saeed, considered the No. 2 in the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and son of Hafiz Saeed, is set to participate in the upcoming Pakistan elections. The political front backed by the 26/11 mastermind raises concerns about the perpetuation of extremist ideologies within Pakistan's political landscape. India's extradition request for Hafiz Saeed emerges as a strategic move with broader geopolitical implications. It not only addresses concerns related to cross-border terrorism but also underscores India's proactive stance in the fight against terror. As the diplomatic maneuver unfolds, the international community watches closely, anticipating the response from Pakistan and the potential impact on regional stability. Live Tv",
