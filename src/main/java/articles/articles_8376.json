    "text": "Rate of stroke deaths among middle-age US adults hit two-decade high during COVID pandemic, report shows Middle-aged people in the United States are more likely to die from a stroke than they have been in about two decades, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Video above: Junk food is leading to memory problems and strokes After at least a decade of decline, the death rate from stroke for people ages 45 to 64 started to rise in 2012. By 2019, the stroke death rate for this age group had grown 7% from where it was seven years earlier, and it spiked another 12% in the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stroke deaths for this age group dipped slightly in 2022 but were still significantly higher than before the pandemic. More than 19,700 people ages 45 to 64 died from a stroke in 2022, according to the new report – about 24 deaths for every 100,000 people in this age group. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. overall, and most strokes happen to people 65 and older. Earlier [research](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2022/01/covid-19-increasing-stroke-risks-people-of-all-ages) has found that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of stroke for people of all ages. But the longer-term rise in stroke death rates among middle-aged people contrasts with the downward trend seen among seniors and elderly people over the past decade, says Sally Curtain, a statistician with the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and author of the new report. Also, racial and ethnic disparities in the death rate from stroke are much higher among middle-aged adults than they are for older adults, she said. Among those 65 and older, the stroke death rate for Black people was 24% higher than it was for White seniors; among those ages 45 to 64, it was 133% higher for Black people than White people. Middle-aged men are more likely to die from a stroke than middle-aged women, and stroke death rates are higher in the South than in any other region, according to the new report. In 2022, there were about 66 deaths from stroke for every 100,000 middle-aged Black men living in the South – nearly three times more than the overall rate for this age group. Experts warn that middle age is an important time to monitor your health and manage risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. \"Many people think about stroke being an older person's disease, and it is. The longer you're alive, the longer the risk factors have to cause plaque to form in blood vessels,\" said Dr. Elisabeth Breese Marsh, a vascular neurologist and director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview. But the arteries start to harden in middle age, which can exacerbate the build-up and lead to complications. \"All of these risk factors are so prevalent in society, and we're seeing them at earlier ages. It is not uncommon for younger people now to have strokes due to these comorbidities,\" said Marsh, who was not involved in the new report. \"No one wants to feel old, but it's taking care of yourself earlier on that really helps you to thrive in middle and later life.\" Stroke diagnosis and treatment options have evolved greatly over the past decade, experts say. And new ways to address comorbidities – such as blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that are used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity – hold promise in managing risk factors. But it's crucial for people who are having a stroke to act fast – and to have equitable access to health care and treatment, experts say. Strokes are often identified by a sudden severe headache, vision problems in one or both eyes, trouble walking, paralysis or numbness in the face or limbs, and trouble speaking or understanding others, according to the Mayo Clinic. The younger brains of middle-age adults have significant potential to recover if treated quickly and aggressively, Marsh said, but people in this age group may wait longer to seek care because they may be less likely to admit they need help. \"It's really important, whether it's the patient or their family, that they recognize the symptoms and get to the hospital as fast as possible,\" she said. \"Those first couple of hours are critical.\"",

On Friday, the mercury dropped to -1 degree Celsius, following Thursday's chilling low of -3 degrees Celsius.

The mountainous tourist destination witnessed a consistent drop in temperature. Whether it's the open fields with vehicles, the seats of scooters and motorcycles, or even the tables and chairs in hotel gardens, all are covered in a layer of pristine white layer of ice. The relentless cold has disrupted daily life, forcing residents to delay their routines until the late morning hours.

In the hill station of Mount Abu, the relentless cold experienced over the last two days has significantly disrupted daily life. The abrupt onset of the piercing cold has presented people with numerous challenges. With the minimum temperature consistently hovering one or two degrees below freezing, daily routines for residents commence only after ten in the morning. Well before nightfall, individuals are observed taking measures to combat the cold, utilising room heaters or other heating methods, underscoring the necessity to fend off the winter chill. Weather scientists indicate that the potential impact of another western disturbance persists for a few more days. This may result in fluctuations in both minimum and maximum temperatures, signalling a sudden resurgence of intense and biting cold conditions. The mercury in Sikar district plunged below freezing, reaching a bone-chilling minus 0.5 degrees Celsius at Fatehpur Agricultural Research Centre. Residents huddle around bonfires and bundle themselves in warm layers, seeking respite from the biting cold under clear skies. Meteorologists warn of even harsher conditions in the coming days. Meanwhile, as many as 39 passenger trains to Delhi are running behind schedule as dense fog conditions continue to prevail in the national capital, resulting in low visibility, railway officials said on Friday. According to Northern Railway, of the 39 trains, three are running late by six hours. This includes the Ajmer-Katra Pooja Express, Katihar-Amritsar Express, and Khajarao-Kurukshetra Express trains. Zero visibility was reported at Delhi (Palam) Airport due to very dense fog conditions, while Safdarjung Airport reported 200 m visibility in dense fog conditions on Friday morning. Apart from Delhi, visibility was recorded below 500 m in several parts of Uttar Pradesh, West Madhya Pradesh, including Gwalior and Malda, Gangetic West Bengal, Assam, parts of Punjab, and Rajasthan's Ganganagar, as per IMD data.

    "text": "MONTREAL — Quebec provincial police have arrested five people in connection with a multimillion-dollar fraud and the theft of data belonging to almost 10 million clients of the co-operative financial group Desjardins. Among those arrested, police said Thursday, is the alleged architect of the scheme, Sébastien Boulanger-Dorval, 42, who worked in the marketing department at the financial institution until 2019, the year the theft was discovered. The four other people arrested are Jean-Loup Masse-Leullier, 32, François Baillargeon-Bouchard, 35, Laurence Bernier, 29, and Charles Bernier, 31. They face charges including fraud, identity theft, and trafficking in identity information. Police said arrest warrants have been issued for three other people allegedly involved in the crimes at Desjardins: Mathieu Joncas, 38, Maxime Paquette, 38, and Juan Pablo Serrano, 38. At a news conference in Quebec City on Thursday, provincial police spokesman Benoît Richard said the investigation \"shed light on how suspects obtained personal information, the ways in which this personal information was then traded between suspects and how these lists were sold to malicious individuals operating several fraud schemes.\" On Wednesday, Montreal-area police said they arrested three other people connected to the case: Ayoub Kourdal, 36; Imad Jbara, 33; and an unnamed third person. Laval police said the three suspects used the stolen Desjardins data to commit fraud totalling $8.9 million between September 2018 and January 2019. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the Commission d’accès à l’information du Québec published scathing reports in 2020 that concluded Desjardins failed to show the level of attention required to protect its customers' data. The OPC report said Desjardins notified the federal office on May 27, 2019, about a breach involving close to 9.7 million individuals in Canada and internationally. It found that Desjardins had been aware of the security weaknesses that led to the breach, but failed to address them in time. The breach occurred \"over more than a two-year period before Desjardins became aware of it, and then only after the organization had been notified by the police,\" the report said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 13, 2024. The Canadian Press",

    "text": "A new sideline video shows just how brutal the windy will be for the San Francisco 49ers clash with the Los Angeles Rams on ‘Thursday Night Football’ this evening.\nThe 49ers and Rams both face must-win situations for tonight’s pivotal ‘Thursday Night Football’ clash. San Francisco enters Sunday with a 6-7 record, two games behind the Seattle Seahawks for tops in the NFC West. Los Angeles is one game behind Seattle with a record of 7-6.\nRain and wind gusts are in the forecast for tonight’s showdown. To get an idea of just how bad the wind is in the area right now, let this video from NFL Network’s Omar Ruiz paint a picture for you:\nKickers checking the flags on the goal posts for conditions tonight?

    "text": "La précieuse couronne d'épines du Christ vénérée par les fidèles à Paris [L'actu chrétienne](/actualite/lactu-chretienne)La précieuse couronne d'épines du Christ vénérée par les fidèles à Paris Depuis le vendredi 16 février 2024, la vénération de la Couronne d’épines du Christ est proposée aux fidèles chaque vendredi de Carême, jusqu’au Vendredi Saint, le 29 mars. Cet acte de foi et de piété populaire connaît de plus en plus de succès. Les explications de Mgr Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, le recteur de Notre Dame de Paris. Durant [le carême ](https://www.rcf.fr/articles/vie-spirituelle/paques-et-la-semaine-sainte-sur-rcf-programmation-speciale)de nombreux fidèles vont vénérer la Couronne d’épines du Christ. Avant de retrouver sa place dans la cathédrale Notre Dame de Paris est exposée à l'Eglise Saint-Germain-l’Auxerrois, à Paris. La sainte Couronne : 16 siècles d’histoire de la chrétienté La couronne d'épines vénérée par les fidèles aurait pu brûler dans l'incendie de Notre-Dame de Paris le 15 avril 2019. Ce joyau de la chrétienté a pu être sauvé des flammes grâce à l'intervention de la brigade des sapeurs-pompiers “La couronne est un cercle de joncs tressés disposée dans un reliquaire en verre” explique Mgr Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, le recteur de Notre Dame de Paris. Selon la tradition c’est cette couronne que Saint Louis a rapporté et qui est le signe le plus fort et le plus grand de la Passion du Christ. La Couronne d’épines vénérée pendant le [Carême](https://www.rcf.fr/dossiers/quest-ce-que-la-semaine-sainte) Depuis le vendredi 16 février 2024, la couronne d'épines est présentée aux fidèles chaque vendredi à 15h, heure symbolique correspondant à la mort du Christ sur la croix. Mais vendredi 29 mars 2024, vendredi saint, jour de la commémoration de la Passion du Christ, la précieuse relique est exposée toute la journée à Saint-Germain-l’Auxerrois. “Cette couronne d'épines est le signe même de la Passion\". explique Mgr Ribadeau Dumas. “Les récits de la Passion nous disent que le Christ a été revêtu au moment de sa passion d'une couronne avec des épines.\" Si à l'heure actuelle, ajoute t’il, \"la couronne n'a plus d'épines, parce qu’elles ont été, au fil des siècles, distribuées dans différents lieux, ces épines sont le signe de ce que le Christ a vécu après avoir partagé le repas de la Cène avec ses disciples au moment où il allait mourir sur la croix.\" Pour le recteur de Notre Dame de Paris, “cette couronne est donc le signe de la passion et de l'amour du Christ vécu jusqu'à l'extrême. Ce que l’on vient vénérer, c'est le Christ dans sa passion. On prie et on rend grâce et en même temps on se confie à cet amour qui est infini du Christ pour chacun de nous.” La vénération de la couronne, un acte de foi et de piété populaire Ce sont les chevaliers du Saint-Sépulcre de Jérusalem qui ont la charge de garder la précieuse relique de la couronne d'épines. Les chanoines de la cathédrale ont, quant à eux, pour mission de la présenter aux fidèles, car cette vénération s'inscrit dans un acte de piété populaire, une dimension qui touche particulièrement Mgr Ribadeau Dumas. Chanoine de la cathédrale depuis plus de 15 ans, il est sensible à la foi des fidèles. “C'est un acte de foi qui se vit là\", confie t’il. \"Les gens viennent quelquefois avec une photo, la photo d'un enfant, la photo d'un parent. Au-delà des mots, c'est le cœur qui parle pour signifier véritablement la confiance et l'amour que l’on a dans le Christ. Je suis personnellement extrêmement émerveillé de tous ceux qui viennent.\" Le recteur de Notre Dame ajoute que cette couronne est aussi un pont très important avec l'orthodoxie. Beaucoup de fidèles orthodoxes, de fidèles orientaux viennent pour vénérer cette couronne d'épines. Et je crois qu'il y a là quelque chose de très fort et de significatif au moment de la semaine sainte. Entre foi et dévotion, la vénération de la couronne d'épines attire chaque année de plus en plus de fidèles. Prier avec des reliques, une démarche qui revient en force. C’est le cas pour la vénération de [la couronne d’épines](https://www.rcf.fr/dossiers/quest-ce-que-le-triduum-pascal-pour-les-chretiens) car, nous dit Mgr Ribadeau Dumas, “La couronne d'épines nous dit quelque chose du mystère de l'incarnation et en même temps du mystère de la rédemption. Pour le recteur de Notre Dame de Paris, \"Dieu s'est fait homme et cet homme, Jésus, a souffert sur le bois de la croix. Et en même temps, il nous a sauvés. Selon Mgr Ribadeau Dumas, “La signification est très forte sur le plan théologique et sur le plan spirituel. Cela nous dit quelque chose de la vie même du Christ et donc du cœur de notre foi. Le recteur de Notre Dame de Paris se réjouit du regain de cette pratique. \"Ce sont des actes tout simples, que l'on peut faire individuellement ou de manière communautaire.\" Du plus grand savant à la personne la plus simple, nous sommes tous à égalité devant cette couronne d'épines. \"Lorsque je présente cette couronne d'épines\", nous dit Mgr Ribadeau Dumas, \"J'aime à penser au regard que le Christ avait sur le bois de la croix. Il regardait Marie, sa mère, il regardait Jean, le disciple bien-aimé, Marie-Madeleine, aussi la femme pécheresse, de ce même regard de tendresse et de miséricorde. \"Pour le recteur de Notre Dame de Paris, \"la couronne d'épines, c'est quelque part le Christ qui regarde avec une infinie miséricorde tous ceux qui viennent à lui.\" Rappelons qu'aujourd'hui, vendredi saint, la couronne d'épines, la relique la plus importante de la Passion du Christ est exposée de 10h à 17h à l'église Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois dans le 1er arrondissement de Paris.
