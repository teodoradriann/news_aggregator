    "title": "Hassan's 23 heart attack deaths in 40 days: Is the Covid vaccine behind the sudden deaths in Karnataka? - The Economic Times",
    "text": "In Hassan, worry has gripped families after 23 people died from heart attacks in only 40 days. Many victims were young or middle-aged. Some were students, others were workers like the 27-year-old woodworker who died last Tuesday. The data paints a bleak picture—between 28 May and 29 June, the deaths covered all age groups, from teenagers to senior citizens.Jayadeva Hospital in Bengaluru has seen an 8% jump in heart patients in two weeks. Most arrive from Hassan and nearby areas. District Health data shows 507 heart attacks were recorded in Hassan in two years. Of these, 190 people could not be saved.CM points finger at Covid vaccineThe sharp rise has pushed the Karnataka government into action. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has formed a special committee. Dr Ravindranath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, will lead it. The panel must submit its findings in ten days.But Siddaramaiah stirred debate by pointing at Covid jabs. On X, he wrote, “Orders were given to this same committee back in February to conduct a thorough study on the reasons behind sudden deaths among young people in the state, and whether the Covid vaccines could have any adverse effects.”He added, “It cannot be denied that the hasty approval and distribution of the Covid vaccine to the public could also be a reason for these deaths, as several studies worldwide have recently indicated that Covid vaccines could be a cause for the increasing number of heart attacks.”Health Minister asks public not to panicHealth Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao urged people to stay calm while the probe continues. He told News18, “Once we get the report, we will be able to speak with greater clarity. These are matters that must be properly investigated. Speculation at this stage could cause unnecessary alarm.”Centre stands firm on vaccine safetyThe Union Health Ministry stepped in quickly. It said on Tuesday there is no evidence to back claims that Covid vaccines cause sudden deaths. It pointed to studies by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). In its statement, the ministry said, “The matter of sudden unexplained deaths has been investigated through several agencies in the country. These studies have conclusively established that there is no direct link between Covid 19 vaccination and the reports of sudden deaths in the country.”Two major studies say no linkICMR ran a nationwide study from May to August 2023. It checked cases in 47 hospitals across 19 states and union territories. Researchers tracked sudden deaths of healthy-looking young adults from October 2021 to March 2023. They found no rise due to vaccines.AIIMS, New Delhi, with ICMR’s support, is conducting another study. Early results show the leading cause remains heart attacks and other health conditions, not vaccines. The ministry stressed, “Studies by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) affirm that Covid-19 vaccines in India are safe and effective, with extremely rare instances of serious side effects. Sudden cardiac deaths can result from a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-Covid complications.”Experts warn against vaccine fearThe Health Ministry warned, “Spreading such claims without proper evidence is harmful. Vaccines saved millions of lives during the pandemic. Such false claims can damage trust in vaccines.”Medical experts too say panic over vaccines could stop people from getting important shots.Doctors say lifestyle plays a big role. Many young professionals work long hours with little rest. The issue is bigger than Hassan. For example, Infosys recently warned staff against working more than 9 hours and 15 minutes a day for five days a week. The IT giant’s note counters co-founder Narayana Murthy’s controversial pitch for a 70-hour work week. The company wants staff to avoid burnout, as long hours can silently raise heart risks.Back in Hassan, families wait for clarity. The expert panel will file its report within days. Until then, doctors ask people to watch for chest pain, breathlessness, or sudden fatigue. Siddaramaiah posted, “We have formed a committee led by Dr Ravindranath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research. They have been asked to study the situation and give a report within 10 days.”Hassan watches. So does the rest of Karnataka.",

    "title": "Unions hold Yellowknife rally as postal strike enters third week",
    "text": "Members of multiple unions staged a solidarity rally outside Yellowknife’s downtown post office on Friday as a postal strike crossed into a third week of action. On the picket line outside the post office, members of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers said time was almost up for any hope of moving northerners’ mail before Christmas.\n“I almost think it’s already too late but, worst-case scenario, come Monday morning, we should be back to work if we’re going to save anything at all for the Christmas period,” said Loretta Kaminski, who works at the Yellowknife post office.\n“In my mind, even just for Yellowknife to the south? Monday.”\nKaminski said she had little optimism that anyone would be returning to work that day.\nTalks between Canada Post and the union collapsed this week , with each side criticizing the other in a series of statements. Officials said there was no point in negotiations continuing for the time being as the sides remained so far apart.\n“I hope they can get back to the table and just figure it out,” said Danielle Hawes, who works at the mail processing plant near Yellowknife’s airport. “Hopefully they can reach some sort of agreement that both sides can agree on and makes everybody happy.”\nHawes thanked the public for their support on the picket line in this week’s frigid temperatures. Members of the Union of Northern Workers, Public Service Alliance of Canada and Northern Territories Federation of Labour joined CUPW members for Friday’s rally.\nFor Kaminski and colleague Julie Thibault, this is the third time they have each experienced a postal strike.\n“We all ought to be at work right now. There’s a lot of northern communities getting access to nothing because we are their main hub,” said Thibault.\n“Other than that, we’ll just keep trying to wait it out and hope for the best.”\nKaminski said she is due to retire in five months’ time after a quarter of a century with the organization.\n“This is not the way I wanted to go out,” she said, accusing Canada Post of “playing more hardball now than they ever did before” in previous labour disputes.\nCanada Post began issuing records of employment and temporarily laying off workers this week, which Kaminski said was a tactic not seen before, questioning its legality. (“Due to CUPW’s ongoing national labour disruption and the significant impact on the company, we have made adjustments to our operations,” a spokesperson for the company said earlier, confirming the layoffs.)\nOn Wednesday, the CUPW said on its website: “Canada Post refuses to drop its proposed rollbacks that will create a second class of worker and undermine good, full-time jobs. As a Crown corporation, Canada Post needs to lead by example, not engage in a race to the bottom with multinational corporate giants.”\nIn an emailed statement on Thursday, Canada Post wrote in part: “We understand the impact CUPW’s national strike is having on so many Canadians. We remain committed to negotiating new agreements that let all employees focus on the future, without adding new fixed costs that will hamper our future.”",

On Friday, INDOT announced their plans to roll out the reopening of the interstate after a three week closure. The closure of I-465 southbound between I-70 and I-65 on the southeast side started on May 31 as crews worked on pavement restoration and bridge work. Now, three weeks later, the road is ready for traffic again. 📍 Marion County— INDOT East Central (@INDOTEast) Here's what to expect for the reopening of the I-465 southbound lanes and ramps. 👇 We start with restriping all of the lanes to get them back to their original configuration. This is a long process - expect the lanes to steadily reopen. [pic.twitter.com/7cdXGy7Lnf] [June 21, 2024] Lanes and ramps will open between late Friday and Saturday morning. Meanwhile, lane restriping will be done slightly north of the reopening — between 46th Street and I-70. Don't breathe too easy though Hoosiers. WATCH | Indiana's Latest Headlines After a three week break, INDOT will close I-465 northbound through the same stretch. That closure is expected to start on July 12.",

    "text": "The Rollercoaster of Compassionate Death\nThe Euthanasia Coaster is designed to thrill the hell out of its passengers just before it kills them.\nEach inversion would have a smaller diameter than the one before in order to inflict 10 g to passengers while the train loses speed. After a sharp right-hand turn the train would enter a straight, where unloading of bodies and loading of passengers could take place.\nThe Euthanasia Coaster would kill its passengers through prolonged cerebral hypoxia, or insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain. The ride’s seven inversions would inflict 10 g on its passengers for 60 seconds — causing g-force related symptoms starting with gray out through tunnel vision to black out and eventually g-LOC, g-force induced loss of consciousness. Depending on the tolerance of an individual passenger to g-forces, the first or second inversion would cause cerebral anoxia, rendering the passengers brain dead. Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of passengers.",

    "title": "Addio a Marianne Faithfull, icona del rock e della cultura pop",
    "text": "Una vita intensa e controversa Marianne Faithfull, scomparsa a 78 anni, ha lasciato un segno indelebile nella storia della musica e della cultura pop. Nata a Hampstead, Londra, in una famiglia benestante, la sua vita è stata caratterizzata da alti e bassi, successi e sfide personali. La sua voce unica e il suo stile inconfondibile l’hanno resa un’icona della Swinging London, un periodo di grande fermento culturale e musicale.\nIl debutto nel mondo della musica La carriera di Marianne è decollata quando, a soli 17 anni, fu notata da Andrew Loog Oldham, il manager dei Rolling Stones. Fu lui a suggerire a Mick Jagger e Keith Richards di scrivere “As Tears Go By”, il suo primo grande successo. Questa canzone, con il suo testo malinconico e profondo, ha catturato l’attenzione del pubblico, segnando l’inizio di una carriera straordinaria. La sua presenza scenica e la sua voce graffiante hanno fatto di lei una figura centrale nella musica degli anni ’60.\nAmori e relazioni La vita personale di Marianne è stata altrettanto intensa. Dopo un matrimonio breve con John Dunbar, la sua relazione con Mick Jagger ha attirato l’attenzione dei media e del pubblico. Questa storia d’amore, segnata da passione e tumulto, ha influenzato non solo la sua vita, ma anche la musica dell’epoca. Marianne ha vissuto in prima persona le sfide della fama, affrontando anche momenti difficili legati a dipendenze e crisi personali. Tuttavia, la sua resilienza e il suo talento l’hanno sempre riportata sulla scena.\nUn’eredità duratura Marianne Faithfull non è stata solo una cantante, ma anche un’attrice e una poetessa. La sua carriera si è evoluta nel tempo, abbracciando diversi generi musicali e collaborando con artisti di fama mondiale. La sua capacità di reinventarsi e di rimanere rilevante nel panorama musicale è un testamento della sua grandezza. Anche dopo la sua scomparsa, la sua musica continua a ispirare nuove generazioni di artisti e fan.",
