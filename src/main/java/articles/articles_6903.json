    "title": "Tornado In Bunbury, Australia Connected To US Storm Spree? AI Says... | Times Now",
    "text": "A tornado ripped through Bunbury in Western Australia, about 150 kms south of Perth, on Friday. Local media reports and residents of the city said that the twister caused severe damage to property and wrecked a community centre where at least 50 children were present. This comes as the United States is battling severe thunderstorm weather and tornadoes for over a month now. Several US states, including Michigan, Texas, Florida, Nebraska, Ohio, Iowa, have been affected by tornadoes. Damage to property and injuries have been reported. As Australia witnessed a massive tornado on Friday afternoon, several social media users asked if the bad weather is connected to the storm spree in the United States. Read More: Jackson Tornado: Mississippi On Alert, Warnings In Bolton And ClintonWe decided to ask Google's Gemini. When asked 'Can tornadoes in the US cause tornadoes in Australia?' - the chatbot said: \\\"No, a tornado in the US cannot directly cause a tornado in Australia. Tornadoes are local phenomena that depend on specific atmospheric conditions in their immediate area.\\\"It further listed reasons, saying the massive distance between the two countries would make it impossible. Here's where we tried to understand the weather and wind patterns. When asked, 'if weather in the United States influence the weather in Australia?', Google's Gemini said: \\\"Yes, to a certain extent, weather in the US can influence weather in Australia, but not in the way a single event like a tornado can directly cause another.\\\"Read More: San Marcos Tornado: Texas City On Alert, Warning Issued In AustinThe chatbot added that the movement of 'air masses around the globe can influence weather patterns in distant locations. For instance, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts both the US and Australia'.However, it is important to note that the influence of US weather on Australia is indirect. Hence, the Bunbury tornado was likely not influenced by the storm spree in the United States.",

    "title": "El Athletic hunde al Leganés bajo el diluvio | Andalucía Información. Noticias de Torremolinos",
    "text": "El Athletic de Bilbao salió victorioso de su visita a Leganés (0-2), un duelo disputado bajo un intenso diluvio del que escapó sin ahogarse gracias al acierto reflejado por el gol de Dani Vivian que desvió Jorge Sáenz, y el de Iñaki Williams mientras los intentos del cuadro madrileño se topaban con los palos. La que iba a ser, aparentemente, una tranquila, y poco habitual en Butarque, tarde de fútbol entre semana, tornó en caótica cuando media hora antes del inicio del choque comenzó a desplegarse sobre el estadio y sus inmediaciones una densa cortina de agua, como hacía muchos años que no se recordaba. Debido a ello se complicó el aparcamiento y el acceso de los aficionados al recinto; se inundó una parte de los pupitres destinados al trabajo de la prensa; y la zona descubierta de la grada, tres cuartos de la misma, lució casi vacía con el pitido de salida. Los problemas fueron poco a poco solucionándose y al cuarto de hora, cuando comenzó a salir el sol, la sensación era la de que no había pasado nada. Eso sí, se quedó por espacio de cuarenta minutos la lluvia, pegajosa y molesta para el desarrollo de un juego fluido. Por ello la primera parte fue gris, tanto o más que el cielo. Solo la rasgó un destello del 'mesías' blanquiazul Sébastien Haller. El esperado delantero, que debutaba ante su público, se hizo con un balón en el centro del campo y, tras dejar por el camino a varios contrarios que fueron al choque con él, sirvió un excelente pase en profundidad para Miguel de la Fuente. Se plantó este ante el portero, que bloqueó su disparo. Apareció entonces de nuevo Haller para intentar definir con un potente disparo, pero se encontró otra vez con Julen Agirrezabala. Fue la ocasión más clara de una mitad inicial en la que el Athletic solo creó peligro de manera tímida con centros laterales y disparos lejanos. Todo ello lo vio Iñaki Williams desde el banquillo, y también a su hermano Nico renqueante tras un choque con Valentin Rosier en el minuto 43. Se quedó este último en el vestuario durante el descanso y a los diez minutos de la reanudación irrumpió en escena el mayor de la saga. Lo agradeció el cuadro rojiblanco, que de su mano mejoró el aspecto. Aún así, estuvo cerca de encajar el primero cuando un pase al interior del área de Miguel de la Fuente lo desvió Unai Núñez hacia el palo. Susto aislado para un conjunto visitante más sólido que poco a poco fue precipitándose sobre el área rival, llamando a una suerte que vino en su auxilio cuando un golpeo de Dani Vivian tras una acción de estrategia se introdujo en la portería al tocarlo Jorge Sáenz. No se conformó el equipo bilbaino con mantener su ventaja y acabó por ampliarla diez minutos más tarde. Lo hizo por medio de Iñaki Williams, que se filtró con sigilo entre Sergio González y un Renato Tapia convertido en central, para recoger una buena asistencia de Andoni Gorosabel y superar al arquero. Sin nada que perder, se lanzó el Leganés a por un tanto que le diera esperanzas. Sin embargo su voluntad chocó una vez más de bruces contra el poste, esta vez en un tiro de Diego García. También se topó con él, casi al final, un cabezazo de Gorka Guruzeta. No hubo mucho más y el Athletic se llevó tres puntos que le dan tranquilidad a costa de un rival que encadena su tercera derrota seguida. - Ficha técnica: 0 - Leganés: Soriano; Rosier, Jorge Sáenz (Tapia, m.71), Nastasic, Sergio González, Franquesa; Brasanac (Juan Cruz, m.71), Cissé, Roberto López (Munir, m.78); Haller (Diego García, m.78) y Miguel de la Fuente. 2 - Athletic: Agirrezabala; Gorosabel, Núñez, Vivian, Yuri; Vesga (Prados, m.56), Ruiz de Galarreta (Ander Herrera, m.62); Berenguer, Unai Gómez (Sancet, m.56), Nico Williams (Guruzeta, m.46); y Djaló (Iñaki Williams, m.56). Goles: 0-1, m.66: Vivian. 0-2, m.76: Iñaki Williams. Árbitro: Francisco José Hernández Maeso (Comité extremeño). Mostró tarjeta amarilla a Miguel de la Fuente (m.41), Rosier (m.63) y Tapia (m.89); jugadores del Leganés. Incidencias: Partido adelantado de la jornada 7 LaLiga EA Sports disputado en el estadio de Butarque ante 8.304 espectadores. En la previa fue homenajeado y realizó el saque de honor Javier Eraso, ex jugador de ambos clubes, al que además se le entregó una camiseta del conjunto local con el dorsal número ocho. En el descanso se homenajeó también al tenista Rafa Jódar, vecino de Leganés y campeón del US Open Junior, quien recibió igualmente una camiseta de manos del presidente Jeff Luhnow y una bandera con el escudo de la ciudad otorgada por el alcalde Miguel Ángel Recuenco.

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main)\n'The work is incredibly important': How a Winnipeg woman has been helping in Ukraine\nHome for the holidays has taken on a whole new meaning for a Winnipeg woman who has spent more than a year in Ukraine rebuilding schools and helping students.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, Patricia Maruschak answered the call and headed to Kyiv in October 2022 to help. She works with Finn Church Aid, a Finnish humanitarian organization that provides education support in emergencies.\nOn her way to Ukraine, she said Russia bombed the centre of Kyiv, killing several people.\n\"That hadn't happened for a long time since the war started. I think it was quite shocking and it was a little bit of a surprise to myself, my family was a little bit concerned,\" she told CTV News.\nBut she noticed something else in Ukraine too – resilience.\n\"Entering into Ukraine by train, you see that despite the fact that it's a country in the middle of a full-blown war, I mean life does go on, people do continue with their everyday normal lives,\" she said.\n\"They persevere despite some difficult and uncertain conditions.\"\nMaruschak heads up Finn Church Aid's office in Ukraine. She and her team work to reopen schools that have been damaged in bombings. Students in Ukraine can't go to school unless it has a functioning bomb shelter, so that is another priority Maruschak tackles.\nHer work goes beyond the school's brick-and-mortar, focussing on the staff and students inside.\n\"They often have to deal with children who have been through some traumatic things, or who have parents who maybe are fighting at the front, or maybe some have even been taken prisoner of war,\" she said.\n\"We try to help them with some psychosocial support, coping mechanisms, and skills as well.\"\nIt is work that Maruschak has made personal sacrifices to do. While working in Ukraine, she has had to leave her husband and two children behind in Winnipeg.\n\"It's still a big change, the fact that she's not here, and then also worrying about what's going on over there, especially when you hear about air raids and alarms and that type of thing,\" her husband Keith Swinton said.\nBut the family strives to include each other in their everyday lives even though they are on different continents most of the year.\n\"If you see a deer on the street, you can photograph it and send it to her,\" Keith said. \"Just including her a bit more in the day-to-day.\"\nStill, her family is proud of the work she is doing.\n\"She's an incredible woman. She's got a unique set of talents and abilities and experience that just led to this. And the work is incredibly important,\" Keith said.\n\"It's important for people to remember what's going on there, that every day children are being affected. Children are dying as a result of Russian bombs in an absolutely senseless war that Ukraine didn't start.\"\nMaruschak has been home in Winnipeg with her family for the holidays, but she says it has been a shift.\nThe sounds of explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire – a part of everyday life in parts of Ukraine – are hard to leave behind.\n\"I also have an air raid alarm app that is on and will tell me when there's an air raid alarm happening,\" she said. \"I still see the notifications, but to just try and go back to a life where that's not a part of the daily reality.\"\nMaruschak is planning to return to Ukraine to continue her work following a Ukrainian Christmas celebration with her family.\nShopping Trends\nThe Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "title": "'The 1% Club' Moves to Fox for Season 2, Joel McHale to Host",
    "text": "Quiz competition series “The 1% Club” has been renewed for a second season, which will air on Fox after previously streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Joel McHale will host Season 2, taking over from Patton Oswalt.\nEach episode of “The 1% Club” begins with 100 contestants who face elimination as they answer a series of questions meant to measure logic, reasoning skills and common sense. They strive to make it to the end and win a $100,000 prize by answering a question only 1% of the country can get right.\nBased on an international format created by Dean Nabarro and Andy Auerbach, “The 1% Club” is produced by BBC Studios Los Angeles Productions and Magnum Media, with BBC Studios distributing. Executive producers include Nabarro and Auerbacfor Magnum as well as Ryan O’Dowd and Krystal Whitney for BBC. Wes Kauble serves as showrunner. The original version of “The 1% Club” began airing on the U.K.’s ITV in 2022, and BBC has since launched the format in Netherlands, Australia, Germany, France, Israel, Spain, Turkey, Mexico, Greece, Ukraine and Hungary along with the U.S.\nMcHale is best known for leading the NBC sitcom “Community” as Jeff Winger from 2009 to 2015, as well as for hosting several unscripted programs, most notably “The Soup” on E! from 2004 to 2015. Currently, he hosts the E! reality competition series “House of Villains” and Fox’s baking competition series “Crime Scene Kitchen.” He also stars as Frank Shaw in the Fox sitcom “Animal Control,” which is currently on its third season.\nMcHale is repped by UTA, Ziffren Brittenham and Johnson Shapiro Slewett Kole.\n“Joel’s outstanding comedic timing and hosting charm already make him a standout talent here at Fox, and now — building on “The 1% Club”‘s strong first year on the network — we’re bringing his unrivaled energy, irreverence and charisma to Season 2,” said Michael Thorn, president of Fox Television Network. “We look forward to expanding on our successful relationship with Joel and continuing our partnership with the incredible production teams at BBC Studios and Magnum.”\n“I am 1,000,000% excited to be partnering with Fox to host “The 1% Club,” said Joel McHale. “I absolutely love the show and love the game play to the 10 𝑥 and guarantee my hair, makeup and wardrobe will look great at least 68% of the time.”\n“99% of us are unfortunately not as funny as Joel McHale, which makes him the perfect host for ‘The 1% Club.’ His unmatched approach to comedy is innately unpredictable and will take audiences on a thrill-ride as they watch him in action with our contestants, striving to put their wits to the test,” said Ryan O’Dowd, president of unscripted at BBC Studios Los Angeles Productions . “’The 1% Club’ has proven to be a massive global hit, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to partner with Rob Wade, Michael Thorn and the talented and passionate team at Fox who believe in this show and in our shared vision for this new season.”",

    "text": "The Good Friday service at EFKS Southwest Brisbane drew churchgoers dressed in white. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\nLocals have gathered across the country to mark Good Friday this Easter long weekend.\nFrom special church services, to family days out in the sun, and seafood-rich dishes — here’s how you’re spending the public holiday.\n‘Blessed’ churchgoers gather in Brisbane In Brisbane, dozens of churchgoers at EFKS Southwest Brisbane dressed in white and gathered at the Samoan Church to celebrate Good Friday.\nIn Samoan culture, traditionally, white is worn during the Easter period.\n“For us, white represents a new life in our culture; it’s such a significant day, so we wear white clothes,” churchgoer Vao said.\nThe Queensland service consisted of hymns, singing and prayer.\nRosie Alaalatoa, who attended the service, said it was a “blessing” to embrace culture and language.\n“It’s a special day for all of us in the Samoan community; we come together and worship, and we’re able to see each other,” she said.\n“This is a beautiful day for the islanders.”\nAnglican Church Southern Queensland Archbishop Jeremy Greaves said in his Good Friday message, “no matter how desperate things seem, it does get better”.\n“Love will endure. Hope will win out,” he said.\nArchbishop Greaves said he hoped people could use the Easter break to find strength, hope and courage to “sing alleluia” in the face of “the darkness of the world”.\nCalls for harmony in Sydney At the St Patrick’s Cathedral in Western Sydney, hundreds gathered to pray through the Stations of the Cross, marking the different phases of Jesus’s life and death.\nBishop Vincent Long led the procession.\nHe began with an Easter message calling for harmony in the Israel-Gaza war, which has been front-of-mind for many in the local community.\nPilgrimage across Melbourne Melbourne Christians also marked Good Friday, by participated in the annual Way of the Cross walk.\nHundreds began the walk at one of Melbourne’s oldest churches, St Francis on Lonsdale Street, and concluded at St Paul’s Cathedral on Flinders Street.\nThe walk takes Christians of different denominations on a journey through Melbourne’s city centre, stopping at many of the city’s historic churches to share reflections, songs, and prayers.\nThe annual pilgrimage has been running since 1998.\nIt passes from church to church, commemorating Jesus’s journey from the Last Supper to the crucifixion and resurrection.\nFollowers were invited to continue the walk when it resumed early on Easter Sunday.\nEaster egg hunt in Hobart Meanwhile, Tasmanians marked Good Friday with an Easter egg hunt for the kids.\nAround 2,000 children and their parents took part in the annual egg hunt and family picnic at the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens.\nClues to find a special chocolate Easter egg surprise were hidden throughout the gardens.\nIt is the 12th year the event has been hosted, which raises funds for medical research across Tasmania.\nSeafood spreads in Perth Over in Western Australia, many are eagerly lining up at the fish markets to score a fresh catch for their Good Friday feast.\nRichard Karagania’s religious background means it’s important to him and his wife — who is Catholic — to avoid red meat on Good Friday, so he was at the fish market bright and early on Friday.\n“It’s all very nice, a tomatoey fish stew,” he said of the fish fillet and extra-large prawns he was picking up.\n“But also it’s a nice time of the year to sit outside and have a seafood meal.”\nThird-generation fishmonger Matt Kailis said the most important thing is to look for this Good Friday is local produce.\n“We’ve got all variety of fish to suit basically any budget and any cooking style,” he said.\n“Traditionally people might have just bought their snapper, but they’re trying a lot of different species of fish, they’re more adventurous in their cooking.”",

    "title": "Focusing on unconditional gratitude for the new year",
    "text": "The Rev. George Matheson was a 19th-century Scottish minister, hymn writer and accomplished author. At the age of 17, Matheson started losing his eyesight and was deemed fully blind at the age of 20. Despite the hardships brought on by blindness, Matheson graduated first in his class at the University of Glasgow and became a clergyman. He dedicated his life to ministering to others through his sermons, writings, and theological and historical studies.\nIn his book, “Moments on the Mount,” now out of print, Matheson wrote a meditation on the value of his affliction — a prayer that reflects a heart seeking to live a life of unconditional gratitude:\n“My God, I have never thanked you for my ‘thorn.’ I have thanked you a thousand times for my roses but never once for my ‘thorn.’ I have been looking forward to a world where I shall get compensation for my cross as itself a present glory. Teach me the glory of my cross; teach me the value of my ‘thorn.’ Show me that I have climbed to you by the path of pain. Show me that my tears have made my rainbow.”\nThe “thorn” in Matheson’s prayer refers to the Apostle Paul’s writing in the 12th chapter of his second letter to the Corinthian church, where he writes about a disease or hardship he endured. He called it his “thorn in the flesh.” The apostle pleaded with God to remove this affliction three times, and God’s answer and the apostle’s response echo the sentiment in Matheson’s prayer:\n“And (God) said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore, most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”\nThe week between Christmas and New Year’s Day is often used as a time to inventory the year that comes to an end. For many years, I have used this week to look back, rejoice in the year’s accomplishments, and acknowledge where changes need to happen before establishing goals for the new year.\nDuring this time, I also ask God to give me a word and a Bible verse to focus on for the next 365 days.\nAs I prayed for 2024, the word “gratitude” rested in my spirit, and the verse that came to mind is found in Paul’s first letter to the church in Thessalonica, chapter 5:\n“Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”\nFor the past couple of months, this mindset of unconditional gratitude has repeatedly come into focus during my devotion time.\nThis year has undoubtedly brought many moments of joy, but it has also brought about difficult circumstances that escape my control. I have found myself crying out to God for deliverance and heard in response the same words that the apostle Paul highlighted throughout his writings. “Be thankful.” “Rejoice.” “My grace is sufficient.”\nIt is so easy to thank God for the beautiful things that have happened in the year that is coming to an end. But to thank him for tribulations can feel like calling pain pleasurable. An oxymoron indeed, until we grasp the importance of changing our perspective concerning difficult circumstances from what we see (or feel) to what God can see and wants to accomplish in and through us.\nWhere we see pain, God sees a purpose in the making. Where we see painful waiting, he sees our faith in his promises.\nGratitude is not a feeling. It is an attitude of the heart. It is a deliberate choice. Unconditional gratitude is born when we understand, as Matheson did, that God desires to make rainbows out of our tears and teach us that it is only through our weaknesses that we experience his strength and grace.\nMay we start the new year with an unwavering commitment to unconditional gratitude, recognizing that God’s grace is sufficient, even in the most challenging circumstances, and immeasurable worth is hidden behind our “thorns.”\nPatricia Holbrook is a columnist, author, podcaster and international speaker.
