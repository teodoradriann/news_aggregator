    "text": "(Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday said the U.S. had surpassed a goal of permitting more than 25 gigawatts of clean energy projects on public lands by 2025 and finalized a plan to slash project fees for wind and solar energy on federal acreage.\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\nThe announcement marks the latest effort by the administration of President Joe Biden to leverage the nation's 250 million acres of federal land to reach his goal of decarbonizing the U.S. power grid by 2035.\nThe permitted projects also appeared to satisfy a Congressional mandate from 2020 that the Interior Department permit at least 25 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2025.\nKEY QUOTE\n\"We know that clean energy including transmission lines, solar energy and storage projects on public lands is helping communities across the country to be part of the climate solution while creating good paying jobs,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said on a call with reporters.\nBY THE NUMBERS\n* The Interior Department has permitted nearly 29 GW ofclean energy on public lands - enough to power more than 12million homes. * The Bureau of Land Management, which manages 250 millionacres of federal lands, has permitted more than 7 GW of projectssince 2021. The agency is processing permits for an additional32 GW of renewable energy. * The finalized Renewable Energy Rule will reduce fees forsolar and wind projects on federal lands by 80% whilestreamlining the application process. WHAT'S NEXT\nThe administration is undertaking a separate effort to identify areas in 11 western states best suited for solar energy development. A final plan is expected by the end of the year.\n(Reporting by Nichola Groom; editing by Diane Craft)\nBy Nichola Groom\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "CORONA, Calif. (KABC) -- A 93-year-old veteran from Corona was recently awarded a Bronze Star Medal for his service in the Korean War after more than seven decades. George Mello, 93, said he's lucky to be alive after having some close calls during combat, but despite all of it, he's lived a fulfilling life. \"I was overwhelmed with all the publicity and the congressman and so forth,\" said Mello about his ceremony in March. Corporal Mello was 17 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army, spending his first two years traveling the country as a construction engineer, but in 1950, he was sent to the Korean peninsula. \"I got there five days after the Korean War broke out,\" he recalled. Mello still remembers the sights and sounds of the battles. \"They fought at night. You could hear the bugles blowing and the chaos, just to frighten us all,\" he said. He fought in five major battles, which he says nearly cost him his life on more than one occasion. Mello's acts of bravery and heroism in combat earned him a Bronze Star and a trip home to spend his final year of enlistment stateside. \"The problem that I had with the service ... they lost my paperwork,\" he said. He never forgot about his award and decided to reach out to Congressman Ken Calvert's office to see what he could do. Calvert's office had him fill out paperwork and got the ball rolling. In March, 71 years after Mello was recognized for his heroism on the battlefield, Calvert pinned the Bronze Star on Mello in a ceremony at his retirement home, surrounded by his children and friends. \"He was a brave soldier who served for some time in that conflict and was finally given the recognition he deserved,\" said Calvert. The Bronze Star Medal is the 4th highest military honor given for heroism and meritorious deed performed in combat.",

    "title": "Union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers reaches deal, ends unlimited strike - Victoria Times Colonist",
    "text": "MONTREAL — A union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers has reached a deal in principle with the government and is ending a strike that has shut around 800 schools since Nov. 23. Fédération autonome de l’enseignement — or FAE — said Thursday night on social media that it spent the day analyzing a tentative deal with the province and will recommend it to its members for approval during general assemblies after the holidays. Details of the agreement have not been released. Even though the FAE called the deal \"a new step,\" it emphasized \"it is up to the teachers to respond to (Premier) François Legault's government and to say whether they feel they have been heard.\" The union said it has ended all of its pressure tactics, such as the general strike that has shut 800 schools, including in Montreal, since the end of November. If students affected by the FAE strike return to school as scheduled in January, they will have been away from classes for almost seven consecutive weeks. The FAE, which represents more than 66,000 teachers, took the most hard line out of all the public sector unions negotiating new contracts with the government when it launched an unlimited general strike. Earlier today, the government announced it had reached tentative deals on salaries with an alliance of unions, excluding the FAE, representing 420,000 public sector employees, including teachers and health-care workers. They had walked out sporadically since November, for a total of 11 days. The only major labour group without any sort of agreement is a nurses union with about 80,000 members — Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec — which said today that negotiations are ongoing. Earlier Thursday, before the FAE announced the end to its strike, Sylvain Martel, spokesman for parents group Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec, said he was feeling optimistic but remaining cautious that 800 schools would reopen after the holiday break. \"We're glad that we're able to hope for going back to school on Jan. 9, but everything is tentative, lots of people have to agree to what's on the table, so let's hope that it's a real deal and (union) members will get what they want,\" he said in an interview. Martel said discussions have been taking place between teachers, parents and administrators about how children will catch up after missing so much school. How that happens will vary, he said, because the effects of the strikes were unequal — some parents taught their children at home, others hired tutors, but many less-fortunate students spent weeks with little to no learning at all. \"It's very difficult for students to go back to the same rhythm they were in November, so it's going to take a little while, but we'll get there,\" he said.

    "title": "Bethlehem’s Palestinian Christians observe sombre Christmas amid Gaza onslaught - Doha News | Qatar",
    "text": "In support and solidarity of Palestininians in Gaza, Christians in the occupied West Bank will be observing a sombre Christmas this year.\nThe Christmas season will be muted among the occupied West Bank’s Christian community amid Israel’s relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip.\nReplacing the accustomed festive celebrations and the Biblical quarter being bedecked with Christmas lights, instead, Palestinian Christians held a vigil on Saturday to pray for peace in Gaza.\nNo Christmas tree in Bethlehem this year amid Israel’s war on Gaza Commenting on the saddened nature of this year’s holiday, Bethlehem’s Deputy Mayor, Hanna Hanania, said during the vigil that “this Christmas comes to Bethlehem in a different shape. Nowadays Bethlehem, as any other Palestinian city, is in mourning,” according to a New Arab report.\nPalestinians in the West Bank are mourning the deaths of their brethren in Gaza. According to Gaza Health Ministry figures, the death toll now stands at over 20,258 people, Anadolu Agency reported on Sunday.\nAmong the casualties, at least 62 of those people were Palestinian journalists and media personnel. In a news release published on Saturday by the Committee to Protect Journalists , ruthless Israeli shelling, communications disruptions and power cuts mean that “journalists in Gaza face particularly high risks as they try to cover the conflict”.\nIsrael attacks 600-year-old monastery in South Lebanon a day before Christmas Eve Also Notably absent this year is the large Christmas centrepiece tree in Bethlehem. Speaking on the solidarity in sorrow among Christian Palestinians during this time, Ibrahim Faltas, a senior Franciscan friar, told Reuters on December 2 that this year’s holiday will omit “the fanfare and [be] without too many lights”.\nIsrael’s collective punishment Aside from an emotional toll of the devastation unfolding just 50km away, Bethlehem’s tourism sector has also suffered financially.\nUsually abuzz with tourists and pilgrims to the biblical birthplace of Jesus, Bethlehem’s streets are a shell of its customary hustle and bustle glory. The muted nature of this year’s Christmas observance has seen a sharp fall in tourists flocking to the historic town.\nLocal businesses, that were just beginning to see recovery in the post Covid-19 era, have been hit hard.\n“We had to let nine employees go,” said Jack Issa Juqman, the owner of a 200-year-old antique workshop in Bethlehem.\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Juqman added that the financial toll taken on the occupied West Bank’s tourist sector is another form of collective punishment by the Israeli forces against the Palestinians.\nFor Reverend Mitri Raheb, a Palestinian Pastor, the story of Christmas draws a harrowing parallel to the current plight of Palestinians. Christmas’ story “talks about Mary, the pregnant woman, on the run. Exactly like 50,000 women in Gaza who are actually displaced” he said to Middle East Monitor .\nHighlighting the dire needs of mothers amid war, the United Nations Population Fund stressed in a post via X on Friday that pregnant women require greater daily water and food intake to prevent malnourishment and dehydration.\n“We must have an immediate humanitarian ceasefire!” their x post concluded.\nUnderscoring the poignant message behind the West Bank’s sombre Christmas observance amid Israel’s renewed aggression on the Gaza Strip, Reverend Munther Isaac said that “if Christ were to be born today, he would be born under the rubble and Israeli shelling”.\nOf the over 20,000 Palestinian casualties since October 7, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated on December 22 that 70% of the victims were women and children.",

    "title": "Tolkien Among the Greeks",
    "text": "J.R.R. Tolkien understood, as many social activists do not, that mercy and forgiveness are essential for human life.\nTolkien Among the Greeks\nIt is not too strong to say that the writings of Oxford don, J. R. R. Tolkien, are a pillar of our collective psyche. But for Tolkien, there is no Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Official Ukrainian government communiques routinely talk of stopping incursions by Orc squads, and Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister, regularly quotes Tolkien in her speeches. In the battle of memes, that other tremendously influential fiction, James Bond, is bested by Gollum and Gandalf.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien’s Utopianism and the Classics expands how we think about Tolkien. It is part of a wave in Tolkien scholarship correcting the long-held focus on the medieval, Nordic Tolkien. Tolkien’s professional life centered on medieval English literature and one of the first reviewers of The Lord of the Rings described it magnificently as the last great medieval epic. Undoubtedly, an Anglo-Saxon and knight-errant mood characterizes his writing, but the legendarium scholars now contend has much to do with his interest in modern books. Tolkien was by no means rigidly anti-modernist. He loved typewriters and cars and was—like his contemporary and fellow veteran of WWI, Ludwig Wittgenstein—an avid reader of crime fiction, with an appreciation of science fiction, too.\nHamish Williams wants to supplement the fresh focus on Tolkien and the moderns with a nod to Tolkien and the ancients. His volume balances the mood of the Germanic, beer-swilling rugged climes of the North in Tolkien with the warmth of the sun-soaked civilization of the South. He points to a Tolkien letter where the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith, is imagined on a latitude with Florence, the Númenórean port city of Pelargir on a latitude with ancient Troy, and Aragorn’s revival of Gondor heralds “an effective Holy Roman Empire with its seat in Rome [rather] than anything that would be devised by a `Nordic.’”\nIf an eyebrow is raised at the thought of Tolkien and the classics, the eyes positively pop at the thought of Tolkien as a utopian. An infantry officer at the Somme, here is what he wrote at the conclusion of WWII after serving in the Home Guard:\nThere is a stand-down parade of Civil Defence in the Parks in the afternoon, to which I shall prob. have to drag myself. But I am afraid it all seems rather a mockery to me, for the War is not over (and the one that is, or the part of it, has largely been lost). But it is of course wrong to fall into such a mood, for Wars are always lost, and The War always goes on; and it is no good growing faint!\nThis is not just Tolkien in a mood. It was a deeply held position. The urtext of the legendarium, The Silmarillion, begins with war breaking out even before God has completed creation.\nLecturer in Classics at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, Williams means something rather specific by utopianism. As with the ancients, utopianism in Tolkien is a method of critique, an exploration of ideas about value order. The idylls of the Shire, Rivendell, and Lothlórien stand in judgment of the dystopian Moria, Isengard, and Mordor. For Williams, Tolkien’s thinking evokes a classical frame, philosophically “establishing precisely which ideals or values were evident in better, relatively more perfect, past communities.”\nThe premise of the book is an intuition ably validated by Williams, though perhaps with overreach. The premise is that Tolkien’s pre-WWI elite education meant his mind was saturated with the classics. Classical literature must then have shaped his writing in some noticeable ways. Tolkien tells us that he never warmed to the classics and did not like Greek civilization. In the just-released, expanded edition of Tolkien’s Letters, which Williams had no access to, Tolkien explains to his son, Christopher:\nIt is part of the nasty Hellenism in which we (certainly I) was brought up, in which that highly dubious character Socrates became more than a saint. The Ancient Greeks were for all their talents, a very nasty people of degraded habits and revolting attitude to women, and profoundly disliked by those among them whom we are supposed to take as representative—such as Plato.\nTolkien disapproved then, but also leaves us in no doubt that he was steeped in the classics and never got too far from them since an English professor’s duties at Oxford once included marking the Latin exams of undergraduates. Williams identifies three themes from classical literature that shape Tolkien’s writing—narratives of hospitality, the sublime, and decline and fall.\nHospitality\nTo explore the common theme of travel far from home in Tolkien, Williams turns to Homer’s Odyssey and its portrait of hospitality. Of course, Williams stresses that the ethics of hospitality is one of the great topics of myth in all civilizations, but Williams identifies striking similarities with Homer’s specific treatment that helps us think afresh about The Hobbit. Tolkien’s first book and perhaps the most cherished is markedly different from, as Williams puts it, the “grand geopolitical scale” of The Lord of the Rings.\nHospitality has a prominent place in the tale. The story begins in Bilbo’s home with the reluctant but generous hospitality he gives to Gandalf and the dwarves. It includes the much-loved scene by the fireside of the trolls and the negotiated welcome Gandalf’s party receives in the home of the shapeshifting Beorn. The book closes with the dwarves reclaiming their ancient home from the dragon Smaug. Tolkien grew the story from the bedtime tales he would tell his children and Williams contends that The Hobbit is an “ethical scrutiny” into what makes a good and bad home.\n“Odyssean reception can also be found in the religious background to various hospitality scenes in the children’s story, which posits benevolent hospitality as essentially absolute, as watched over by a magical, supernatural, even divine order.” Calypso’s cave has a “great fire” that is a welcome to Odysseus on his travels. Later, the cave becomes his prison, his detention blocking his desire to get home. Calypso is forced to release the traveler by the intervention of higher divinities. Throughout The Hobbit, Gandalf stands as a corrective for each infraction of the hospitality principle.\nStrong pages include a close reading of Tolkien’s humorous troll passage. Williams acknowledges the Nordic heritage of trolls but points to Homer’s ogre host Polyphemus as a template. The ogre eats his guests, but they had also planned to raid him. The cyclops is a primitive chef just like William and his pals, and the dwarves get caught and readied for eating because Bilbo tried to pinch food from them. In the Odyssey, the feast of the giants is interrupted by a linguistic trick and Gandalf saves his traveling band similarly.\nAfter this encounter, the hobbits are guided by Gandalf to Elrond’s house. There are similarities with the island-palace of Aeolus. Odysseus arrives there after his encounter with the giant man-eaters. Both homes are out-of-the-way places, little utopias watched over by authorities with divine-like magical powers. Aeolus is master of the winds and Elrond has power over the rivers. Each offers grand hospitality, Elrond’s home, relays Bilbo, “was perfect, whether you like food, or sleep, or work, or storytelling, or singing, or just sitting and thinking best.” In both stories, stays in such paradises are short, pointing to a glimpse of a joy not typical of human life. Williams points out that the orphaned Tolkien lived in no less than nine different homes between 1892 and 1904.\nSublime\nOvid’s orphic Old Forest is a template for the many examples in Tolkien of transcending the ordinary through experience of nature, contends Williams. In addition to the voluminous commentary on Tolkien as an eco-writer, Williams argues that Tolkien’s dense detailing of the natural world relies on the Roman literary device of nature as an encounter with the sublime. As many have pointed out, Tolkien is not straightforwardly a champion of nature. The hedge about Buckland does constant battle with the trees of the Old Forest that would take over the pastures of the Shire. Tolkien’s oft-stated attachment to trees does not exclude his Old Forest from being a bewildering place that has something in common with ancient Orphism played out in “the archetypal forest” of Ovid’s Metamorphoses.\nOvid’s forest is dark, destructive, and numinous and Tolkien’s Old Man Willow is similarly a “quasi-divine figure of destruction.” A malign presence in the forest, the willow’s influence is offset by Tom Bombadil. Bombadil is “in line with the Ovidian motif of finding a god in the central glade of the sacred grove.” Encountering Bombadil in the woods, the disoriented hobbits are inducted into rare knowledge as Bombadil “told them tales of bees and flowers, the ways of tress, and the strange creatures of the Forest.” Williams points out that Orpheus’s recital of a long list of trees could hardly have failed to make an impression on the tree-loving Tolkien. As Williams astutely points out, Tom also has a bit of the Bacchus about him. Tom would never indulge the manic Dionysian rites, but he has a mad-cap quality and a definite “best not disturb” mood attached to him since it is indicated that he has tremendous reserves of power despite his jocular silliness. Even the august Lord Elrond, who is over six thousand years old, admits that he is completely mystified by the orphic Bombadil.\nNarratives of Decline and Fall\nMiddle-earth is dotted with the ruins of earlier ages. For example, the dwarf mines of Moria and Gondor’s Argonath both speak to greatness long lost. In classical literature, lapsarian narratives, Williams tells us, are “a means of reflection on utopian communities,” a device used “to reinforce definite moral and social virtues.” Throughout his life, Tolkien had a recurring nightmare of an enormous wave washing all away. In his letters, he frequently mentions Atlantis. In the legendarium, Númenor is washed away by a retributive tsunami of the gods.\nThe moral meaning of Númenor is tricky. In Williams’s gloss, Númenor transitions from a moderate occidental island realm to an expansionist orientalized kingdom. This expansion brings ruin. Númenor in its infancy points to a core value in Tolkien of “ontological moderation.” I think this point is very strong. For Tolkien, respectful of the limits placed upon us by the gods, rule should always be temperate and restrained. This important observation leads Williams to a perceptive portrait of Faramir. He is the only character in The Lord of the Rings who prays. His hideout in Ithilien is “plain and unadorned for the most part.” He consciously looks west to old Númenor, to “that which is beyond Elvenhome and will ever be.” However, it is too strong to link Númenor to our Occident. Williams writes, “It is a means of establishing what ideals or virtues defined the once-utopian community of Númenor—a moderate, pious, ascetic, economically insular, sophocratic and, to an extent, ideally Occidental community.” Here, Williams drifts too close to Greek history, I think. He parallels Númenor to the experience of Athens once too involved with Persia: in the classic telling, a case of the corruption of empire bleeding through and corroding Athenian republican virtue.\nTo understand Tolkien’s Númenor right, myth, not history, is needed. The struggle between sea and land is a staple of myth. Geopolitical thinkers have used the myth of the conflict between the Leviathan and Behemoth as a template for thinking about the basic tension between sea and land powers. Númenor’s fall reflects this tension. In Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth, Tolkien compresses this tension into the fraught relationship between King Melendur and his son, Aldarion, a sea captain. “Melendur looked coldly on the enterprises of his son, and cared not to hear the tale of his journeys, believing that he sowed the seed of restlessness and desire of other lands to hold.” Melendur warns his son to no avail that his love of the sea will make him forget what is owed the gods and their Ban on sea-borne adventuring. Aldarion develops Númenor as a sea power, a path that ultimately provokes divine cataclysmic punishment. Tolkien’s story, I believe, traces not to Greek history but a mythic worry about the sea as an immodest subverter of boundaries.\nBefore concluding, I should note that I wish this good book had been edited differently. Another version of this book would have been welcome amongst the classical education movement in the US. There is a significant interest in Tolkien amongst these students, as seen for instance in the Agathon Institute in Syracuse. However, the volume is written in a language typical of modern university scholarship with good ideas clouded by phrases like “gothic genre-codes” and “retrotopianism.” It would read so much leaner if ordinary language had been used throughout to develop concepts. Regular conservative readers would have enjoyed Williams’s treatment of Tolkien’s conservatism, the worth of which can be glimpsed in “an imperial `Augustan’ regency backed up by a Platonic sophocratic nobility, with perhaps further medieval class hierarchies implied.” For those interested in Tolkien, I strongly recommend this book and just advise barreling through some of its phrasing.",
