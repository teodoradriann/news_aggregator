    "text": "The State Administration for Religious Affairs, China's primary body overseeing recognised religions, introduced an updated version of the Measures for the Administration of Tibetan Buddhist Temples on December 1, 2024.\nAccording to a report by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), the new law--adopted in September 2024 and enacted on January 1, 2025--\"greatly increased state control over Tibetan religious practice by integrating political directives into Tibetan religious administration.\"\nTo further entwine religious practice with state ideology, the amendment \"adds explicit political conditions. By making these demands legally binding, the CCP strengthens its hold over monasteries and clergy,\" the TCHRD report stated.\n The report highlighted that to \"'create a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation,' Tibetan Buddhists are subtly under pressure to integrate their unique culture and identity into the prevailing Han Chinese framework.\" This policy aligns with China's broader efforts to assimilate Tibetan culture and \"fits in with the CCP's overarching objective of sinicising religion.\"\nThe updated Measures for the Administration of Tibetan Buddhist Temples enforce \"political loyalty criteria in religious administration, therefore methodically enforcing the Chinese Communist Party's ideological grip over Tibetan Buddhism.\"\nTCHRD outlined how these measures undermine China's legal protections, specifically Article 36 of the Constitution, which \"expressly grants citizens the right to freedom of religious belief,\" and Article 11 of the Regional National Autonomy Law. These actions, it stated, \"are a part of the larger state efforts to integrate Tibetan spiritual and cultural identity into the dominant Han identity.\"\n\"The Chinese government has significantly escalated its suppression of religious freedom in Tibet in the last decade,\" said Dawa Tashi, a researcher at TCHRD. \"Through coercive 'patriotic education' campaigns designed to instil loyalty, strict control over monastic institutions, and widespread arbitrary arrests and detentions, authorities have tightened their grip. Today, religion in Tibet is not just regulated--it is ruled with an iron fist.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "text": "Quadrantids light up the heavens - 2024's first meteor shower The Quadrantids meteor shower, one of the best annual meteor showers, will peak in early January 2024, offering a spectacular display with up to 120 meteors per hour. This event is particularly notable for its potential to produce bright fireballs, [according to USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/01/quadrantids-2024-meteor-shower-how-to/72077114007/#:~:text=The%20meteor%20shower%20is%20active,to%20dawn%2C%20according%20to%20EarthSky.). From December 26, 2023, to January 16, 2024, the Quadrantids will peak on January 4. The optimal viewing time of this year's Quadrantids meteor shower is at 7:53 a.m. EST (12:53 GMT) on January 4. Therefore, the optimal viewing time in North America would be the pre-dawn hours, approximately from 4:53 a.m. EST until dawn. Viewers in the western parts of the continent will have a better opportunity to observe the Quadrantids earlier at night. However, the maximum activity of this meteor shower is brief, lasting only about six hours, and is often hindered by poor weather conditions typical in early January. Additionally, the moon's half illumination during this period might make it more challenging to view the shooting stars. However, the brighter fireballs are expected to be visible even in light-polluted areas. The Quadrantids are known for their sharp peak in activity, similar to the Lyrids, Leonids, and Ursids, the other three major meteor showers with a distinct peak each year. Tips for observers [NASA advises](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/quadrantids/) observing the Quadrantids meteor shower during the night and the hours before dawn for optimal viewing. To enjoy the Quadrantids fully, select a location far from the city and street lights and be equipped for cold weather conditions. NASA recommends lying on your back with your feet pointed northeast and gazing upwards to cover a broad expanse of the sky. Your eyes will adjust to the darkness in under 30 minutes, allowing you to start seeing meteors. Meteor shower The background of the Quadrantids meteor shower lies in its unique characteristics and annual occurrence. This meteor shower is named after a now-obsolete constellation, Quadrans Muralis, and is renowned for its intense peak activity and the potential to produce bright fireballs. The Quadrantids and the other major meteor showers offer a recurring celestial spectacle that attracts astronomers and stargazers alike, highlighting our night sky's dynamic and ever-changing nature. Also, we [recently wrote](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/strong-magnetic-storm-to-hit-soon-when-and-1704191129.html) that a strong magnetic storm will hit soon.",

    "text": "Snow, cold and a delayed game were not enough to stop the Buffalo Bills.\nThe team beat the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31-17, in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs on Monday.\nThe game was originally scheduled to be played on Sunday, but had to be delayed after more than nine inches of snow fell over the weekend. The team put out a request on social media for fans to help shovel snow ahead of the game.\nThe fans and ground crew did an amazing job at getting Highmark Stadium ready ahead of the game. The field was completely clear of snow by kickoff time.\nQuarterback thrived in the cold conditions, leading the Bills to a touchdown on their first drive of the game.\nSEE MORE: Body-numbing cold hospitalized 15 during Chiefs-Dolphins playoff game\nThe Bills built a 21-0 lead before a blocked field goal shifted the momentum of the game. The block allowed the Steelers to go down the field and score a touchdown before halftime.\nIn the second half, the Steelers would cut the Bills' lead to seven, but that's as close as Pittsburgh would get. The Bill would tack on another touchdown with about six minutes left in the game.\nThe win sets up a highly-anticipated matchup between the Bills and Kansas City Chiefs. It's a rematch of a game in the regular season that the Bills won. It ended in controversy as the Chiefs were flagged for being offsides on a play that would have gone for a touchdown.\nSunday's game will take place in Buffalo at 6:30 p.m. Eastern.",

    "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan caught everyone’s attention after the actress shared Clint Eastwood’s quote about not seeking luxury through money but via the small joys in life. The actress is receiving backlash for endorsing not chasing luxury although her wealth includes her husband, Saif Ali Khan’s palace!\\nThe quote shared by Kareena on Instagram read, “Don’t look for luxury in watches or bracelets, don’t look for it in mansions or sailboats; luxury is laughter and friends, luxury is not being sick, luxury is the rain on your face, and luxury is hugs and kisses. Don’t look for luxury in stores or in gifts, don’t look for it in parties or events. Luxury is that people love you, luxury is that they respect you, luxury is that your parents live, luxury is being able to play with your grandchildren, luxury is those little things that cannot be bought with money.”\\nKareena shared the post with the caption, “Read it again and again (red heart emoji).” This found its way on Reddit where people slammed the actress for her ‘hypocrisy’. One person wrote, “Made me laugh. People living in luxury talking about how luxury is not the most important thing in life.” Another added, “No hate or jealousy here but I always find it funny (and tone-deaf) when people who are uber-rich post about how money is not everything in life. I mean if you had gotten the short end of the stick in life, surely ‘materialistic’ things would be first on your list.”\\nOne person wrote, “As Micheal Corleone said in Godfather 2, ‘This contempt for money is just another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it.’” Another added, “The irony. This woman has Pataudi Palace and goes to Gstaad every year.” “They live in their own bubble. Take luxury out of their lives then we’ll see,” a comment read. “This is like the thing where people with money preach of money not giving you happiness and people with things preaching abt minimalism. This is a luxury. Money gives you that luxury to talk sh*t like this,” read another comment.\\nMeanwhile, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Hansal Mehta recently announced the release date of their long-awaited film, The Buckingham Murders. Kareena confirmed that The Buckingham Murders will be a theatrical release. She revealed that The Buckingham Murders will be released on September 13. The film will take the slot left empty by Sara Ali Khan’s Metro In Dino, which also stars Aditya Roy Kapur.",
