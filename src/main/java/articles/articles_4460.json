    "text": "A man has appeared in court charged with murder after the death of a 23-year-old man in Cardiff on Christmas Eve. William Bush – described by relatives as “loyal, funny and caring” – was found with injuries at an address in Chapel Street at about 11.30am on Sunday, South Wales Police said. Dylan Thomas, 23, of Llandaff, appeared at Cardiff Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. He was remanded in custody to appear at Cardiff Crown Court on January 2. In a statement after the hearing, the Bush family said: “This week our beloved Will was taken away from us in such a cruel and indescribable way. “Will was such a loyal, funny and caring son, brother and boyfriend. “We are absolutely devastated and as a family request that our privacy is respected at this difficult time.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Augustman Cancer To Scorpio, These Zodiac Signs Will Be Unlucky In 2024 Read full article Kriti Nayyar 28 December 2023 at 10:26 am · 6-min read\nRemember when Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky Balboa said, “The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place..” While we all wish we could live in a warm and fuzzy fantasy world, life hits us hard and we’re often cursing our luck. Every year brings new opportunities, new decisions and new choices and all of us are hoping 2024 to be phenomenal. For some zodiac signs, 2024 will surely be a blessing. However, other zodiacs might find themselves caught up in a series of unfortunate events and obstacles as the stars aren’t in their favour. Let’s take you on a journey through the cosmos and familiarise you with the four unlucky zodiac signs that’ll have a challenging 2024.\n2024 looks different for everyone, but it certainly promises more fun and surprises for all regardless of your zodiac sign, so don’t worry! Just because some folks will have a bit more cosmic luck on their side, doesn’t mean fortune Gods have nothing in store for you. Let’s explore the fate of these unlucky zodiac signs .\nFour zodiac signs that will be unlucky in 2024 Cancer ( June 21 to July 22) Image credit: Darkmoon_Art/ Pixabay Cancerians, 2024 will bring joy and success as well as pain and failure. You’ll finally let go of all the negativity and hurt that your trusted ones have given you, becoming a totally new person who seeks and embraces change. The upcoming year is filled with emotional hurdles, so don’t shy away from indulging in self-love and having an open line of communication with your loved ones.\nOn the bright side, your social circle, friendships and relationships will be at an all-time high in the middle of 2024. You’ll be surrounded by people who adore and love you and even chance upon a soulmate through your network of friends. Your love life will be crazy and chaotic, and things will get intense if you act wisely. Steer clear of lover’s quarrels! There’s also a Mars retrograde in your zodiac sign that can cause friction in relationships towards year-end and into 2025. This year will be fairly good from a family point of view and domestic bliss will bring you joy.\nStory continues Coming to finances, you have to protect your future security by doing some research and managing how you allocate your wealth. Consult experts, be open to new ideas, tweaks and adjustments that will benefit you. Make finances your homework project and work seriously on it.\nLeo ( July 23 to August 22) Image credit: Darkmoon_Art/ Pixabay Leos , you might encounter some intense energy from Saturn and Pluto and face some unexpected obstacles in 2024. 2024 will take you through a series of professional setbacks and strained relationships. But with your charisma and confidence, you can thrive in the face of adversity. You have to be humble and open to new experiences, embrace your creativity and venture outdoors to boost your spirits. By seeking guidance and reaching out to your close entourage, you can navigate many trials and tribulations.\nNotably, the planet of expansion, Jupiter, will enter your realm after June 2024 – imbuing your life with joy that will last through the rest of the year. The upcoming year will be full of epiphanies and realisations as you come to terms with the losses in your life and find meaning out of those to move ahead gracefully.\nWhen it comes to love life, 2024 comes with highs and lows. You might have to move away from your loved ones, or you might even fall in love with someone who lives far away. Navigating the distance will be challenging. From a family point of view, things look tumultuous. Family discords will happen frequently in the first half of 2024, so tread with patience and caution. Things will likely take a positive turn towards the second half.\nLastly, your health and career horoscope aren’t the best either. Pay special attention to your eating habits, steer clear of fights that will drain your mental health and avoid unnecessary journeys. In terms of career, you will feel overwhelmed and unmotivated to complete daily tasks and your colleagues might add to workplace hindrances. But the second half of 2024 will be much better professionally.\nWellness\nThese Are The Lucky Numbers For Your Zodiac Signs According To Numerology By Preeti Kulkarni, Jul 21\nWellness\nFind Out Your Lucky Car Colour According To Your Zodiac Sign By Tania Tarafdar, Jul 07\nVirgo ( August 23 to September 22) Image credit: Darkmoon_Art/ Pixabay Your shy and hesitant nature will do you more harm than good in 2024, Virgos . It’s time to shed away your insecurities and self-deprecating streak and grab every opportunity that knocks at your door. You might have trouble executing your plans because of being precision oriented. All we suggest is that you be open-minded, social and carefree instead of beating yourself up for every hiccup. Your meticulous approach will be disrupted by the cosmos, leading you into unchartered territories and uncertainty. Don’t stress and overthink – at least that’s what your stars are asking.\nWhether it’s romantic and family relationships or friendships – communication is the key theme for you in 2024. Forge deeper connections by having uncomfortable conversations, asking big questions, delving into the future and discussing each other’s hopes and fears. 2024 is also a great time to solidify your friendships as this is where you’ll find a lot of joy. Plan get-togethers, coffee-catchups, mini getaways, dinners, and chill sessions with your pals.\nAs for money and finances , it’s time to plug away the restrictions, go a little easy and invest where you think there’s potential. Be open-minded (and just a little speculative) and you’ll see a noticeable shift in your financial status.\nScorpio ( October 23 to November 21) Image credit: Darkmoon_Art/ Pixabay Stubborn Scorpios , your sense of control will be challenged in 2024. So, brace yourself for the unexpected. You’ll shift and evolve in many ways, outgrowing many people, relationships and jobs that you once held dear to you. The presence of Saturn can cause turbulence in matters of dating, romance and true love, making them harder to attain and enjoy.\nYour bull-headed nature on wrong things can be very disastrous. It’s time to get free-spirited and concentrate on work. Unleash and execute your ideas about wealth, revenue creation and savings and you might get blessed with the stream of money and security that comes with it. Just have faith in your abilities.\nComing to love and relationships, the first half looks promising. There are good chances of both marriage and engagement, and even married couples will thrive in this period. However, the second half of 2024 looks quite packed, and you won’t be able to spend as much time with your partner. This could lead to altercations, which is why you need to stay calm and try to be more accommodating of their needs.\nWellness\nWhere You Should Be Travelling To In 2024, According To Your Zodiac Sign By Preeti Kulkarni, Dec 18\nWellness\nHow Will All The Mercury Retrogrades In 2024 Affect Your Zodiac Sign?

    "text": "Dice que harán una oposición \"constructiva\" y el respaldo del PSOE dependerá de las políticas que proponga cada gobierno autonómico\nMADRID, 12 Jul. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, ha celebrado la ruptura de los gobiernos autonómicos de PP y Vox y le ha pedido al líder nacional de los 'populares', Alberto Núñez Feijóo, que derogue las \"contrarreformas\" aprobadas durante este año y además que rompa los pactos con la formación de Santiago Abascal en los ayuntamiento.\nEn una rueda de prensa desde Washington, al finalizar la cumbre de la OTAN, ha asegurado que los socialistas harán una oposición \"constructiva\" y su apoyo a los gobiernos autonómicos gobernados por el PP dependerán de las políticas que ponga sobre la mesa en cada comunidad.\nEn todo caso ha afirmado que es \"un gran día para España\" y que, después de la ruptura de los gobiernos de PP y Vox, es \"un país mejor\" y por tanto ha señalado que no puede ocultar su \"alegría y felicidad\".\nEn este sentido, ha advertido de que en los próximos días habrá mucha \"politiquería\" para interpretar a quién beneficia o perjudica esta nueva situación, pero, según ha señalado \"los beneficiarios netos de la salida de la ultraderecha de los gobiernos autonómicos es la mayoría social de españoles y españolas\".\nQUE ACEPTE LA REFORMA DE EXTRANJERÍA No obstante, Sánchez ha remarcado que esta es una decisión que toma Vox y por tanto pide al PP que rompa con las políticas que ha aprobado con los de Abascal hasta el día de hoy. En primer lugar le exige que acepte la reforma de la Ley de Extranjería para que el reparto de menores migrantes entre las comunidades autónomas sea obligatorio.\nSegún indica, sería \"la prueba del algodón\" de que el PP \"ha roto con las políticas de Vox\", dado que esta crisis viene provocada por la negativa de esta formación a aceptar el reparto de menores migrantes.\nEl presidente considera que ha quedado demostrado que la estrategia de \"gobernar con la ultraderecha ha fracasado\" y reitera que es una gran noticia para los españoles, porque estos gobiernos han aprobado políticas \"ultraderechistas\" en materias como violencia de género, memoria democrática, servicios sociales y calidad de servicios públicos, transición ecológica y también sobre cambio climático, según ha enumerado.\nLeer más acerca de: Feijóo Pedro Sánchez Santiago Abascal PP VOX",

    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. – Future farmers and leaders in agriculture need to understand and implement technologies that use artificial intelligence. A team of University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) faculty are working toward creating new curriculum to train the next generation of agriculture students.\nLed by Hao Gan, assistant professor in the Department of Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science, the team won a four-year grant for $741,102 from the USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The project, “Development of a Smart Agricultural Experiential Learning Program for Youth,” will create hands-on curriculum about using drones, ground robots, computer vision systems, and other AI-related technologies. The team will recruit 10-12 youth participants, ages 15-20, each year for four years to participate in a four-week hands-on learning experience, starting in 2025.\n“The ultimate goal of our team is to establish the Smart Agriculture Education Center at the University of Tennessee ,” Gan said. “We believe this curriculum also will improve the perception of working in agriculture, enhance the future workforce and bring about the adoption of more smart agricultural technology to produce more food.”\nThe experiential learning program will be developed in collaboration with Tennessee 4-H Youth Development, UT AgResearch and Education Centers and Rocket Drones, a Memphis-based company that provides drone training programs.\nThe team also includes Lori Duncan, assistant professor in the Department of Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science; Hongping Zhang, clinical assistant professor in the UT Knoxville Department of Retail, Hospitality, and Tourism Management; and Lynne Middleton, Extension specialist for 4-H Youth Development.\n“I am excited to recruit 4-H members from across the state who will participate in this annual four-week initiative to be held on the UT campus in Knoxville,” Middleton said. “The youth chosen will hone their skills in coding, drone-work, and robotics. They will walk away with new skills that support the smart ag industry, and hopefully, decide on their future career path.”\nThe University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture is comprised of the Herbert College of Agriculture, UT College of Veterinary Medicine, UT AgResearch and UT Extension. Through its land-grant mission of teaching, research and outreach, the Institute touches lives and provides Real. Life.
