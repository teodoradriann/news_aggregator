    "text": "Arsenic in Drinking Water Tied to Kidney Cancer Risk\nBy Lori Solomon HealthDay Reporter\nTHURSDAY, Dec. 19, 2024 -- Even low levels of arsenic exposure in drinking water may increase the risk for kidney cancer, according to a study published online Dec. 15 in Environmental Pollution.\nNishat Tasnim Hasan, Dr.P.H., from Texas A&M University in College Station, and colleagues assessed the association between county-level drinking water arsenic levels and kidney cancer incidences using data from 240 counties in Texas. The analysis included 28,896 cancer cases among adults aged 20 years and older and 101,776,294 person-years from 2016 to 2020.\nThe researchers found that when adjusting for spatial factors and covariates (e.g., demographic and socioeconomic factors and cancer risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and diabetes), there was a 6 and 22 percent higher incidence of cancer in the medium (1 to 5 ppb; relative risk, 1.06) and high arsenic (>5 ppb) group counties (relative risk, 1.22) versus low arsenic-level counties (<1 ppb), showing a dose-response relationship. When arsenic was treated as a continuous variable, the incidence increased by 4 percent for each doubling of drinking water arsenic level (relative risk, 1.04).\n\"This suggests that even low-level arsenic exposure in drinking water may be associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer, which aligns with previous research indicating an association between this exposure and lung, bladder, and skin cancers,\" coauthor Taehyun Roh, Ph.D., also from Texas A&M University, said in a statement.\nAbstract/Full Text (subscription or payment may be required)\nDisclaimer: Statistical data in medical articles provide general trends and do not pertain to individuals.

Una fuente palestina, bajo condición de anonimato, dijo que “hay un gran avance en las negociaciones entre el movimiento palestino [Hamás e Israel](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo/2024/05/02/israel-terminara-la-guerra-en-gaza-sin-cumplir-su-objetivo-de-destruir-a-hamas/)”, y detalló que la delegación egipcia en el proceso negociador “ha alcanzado una formulación acordada en cuanto a los puntos de discrepancia”. Precisó que el último acuerdo sobre el que discuten actualmente incluye una primera fase de 40 días de tregua en la que se liberarán 33 [rehenes israelíes](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo/2024/04/17/rehenes-en-israel-3-mil-600-palestinos-estan-en-carceles-israelies-sin-cargos/) del total de unos 128 retenidos por Hamás, mientras que el Ejército israelí se retirará de las zonas en las que esté presente en la Franja de Gaza. Según esta misma fuente, la segunda fase continuará por otro periodo de 42 días durante el cual se liberarán todos los rehenes restantes y se extenderá un proceso de “calma permanente en Gaza”, mientras que la tercera y la última fase incluirá intercambiar los cadáveres y durará también 42 días. También apuntó que quiere un compromiso estadounidense por escrito para el fin incondicional de los combates” y solicita también que Israel no impida regresar al territorio ocupado de [Cisjordania](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo/2024/04/22/amnistia-internacional-denuncia-apartheid-en-palestina-tras-ataques-de-israelies-en-cisjordania/) a los palestinos liberados a cambio de los rehenes. Según un alto funcionario de Hamás citado por la cadena catarí Al Jazeera, el hecho de que [Netanyahu](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo/2024/04/22/conflicto-israel-vs-iran-cual-es-el-objetivo-secreto-de-benjamin-netanyahu/) insista en que Israel entrará en la ciudad de Rafah con independencia de un posible acuerdo es un “elemento clave” que también se está discutiendo hoy en las conversaciones. Hasta el momento, en el enclave palestino, al menos 32 personas fallecieron en las últimas 24 horas, lo que elevó a 34 mil 654 el número de víctimas mortales registradas en los hospitales del enclave, además de más de 77 mil 900 heridos, según datos del Ministerio de Sanidad gazatí, dependiente de Hamás.",
