    "text": "La familia del soldado Carlos León Rico, de 24 años, natural de El Viso del Alcor (Sevilla) y fallecido recientemente junto con el cabo Miguel Ángel Jiménez Andújar en unas maniobras en la base de la Brigada Guzmán el Bueno X de Cerro Muriano, en Córdoba, se ha personado en las diligencias previas incoadas por el asunto por el Juzgado de Instrucción Número Cuatro de Córdoba y prevé formalizar este viernes su denuncia contra el capitán responsable del ejercicio y sus tres superiores inmediatos. El letrado Luis Romero, que representa a la familia del difunto soldado Carlos León Rico, ha informado de que la denuncia se dirige contra dicho capitán, retirado del mando por el Ejército de Tierra a cuenta de los hechos; el teniente coronel inmediatamente superior a él, un coronel y un general, con petición de que todos ellos sean llamados como investigados al procedimiento judicial. Las diligencias previas, según el letrado, giran en torno a dos presuntos delitos de homicidio imprudente, toda vez que ambos efectivos fallecieron ahogados en un lago de la base, realizando un ejercicio práctico. Según la Asociación de Tropa y Marinería Española (ATME), este suceso saldado con la muerte por ahogamiento de dos militares de tropa del Regimiento de Infantería La Reina 2 y otros dos hospitalizados por hipotermia \"se produjo sobre las 9,00 horas, con una temperatura muy baja, mientras se realizaba ejercicio de paso de cursos de agua con equipo completo en el embalse situado en el Campo de Maniobras\" de la base de la Brigada Guzmán el Bueno X. En dicho ejercicio \"participaban, entre otros, los nuevos militares que se habían incorporado hacía pocos meses del Centro de Formación, los cuales, a la finalización de este, recibirían la tradicional boina de la unidad\", según ha precisado ATME. La asociación ha solicitado \"información sobre el número de horas, recogidas en el Plan de Instrucción, que realizó el personal de nueva incorporación que participaba en el ejercicio, con el fin de aprender los procedimientos que se deberían poner en práctica para saber reaccionar en las situaciones ambientales en que se realizó el ejercicio dentro del embalse\". También quiere saber la asociación de militares profesionales, \"si el ejercicio de paso de cursos de agua estaba recogido en la programación de las maniobras y qué medidas de seguridad y sanitarias se tomaron\", tales como la \"presencia de ambulancia, de médico, de sanitarios, etcétera\".

    "text": "“Arise From the dead!” The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (John 10:10). Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light (Ephesians 5:14). This letter was from a man named Steve who was trapped in the snares of Satan. Maybe his story is like yours! I had basically a normal happy childhood, with caring parents who loved us. I had no teaching though about salvation, or how to know the true God of the bible. My parents left that up to the Catholic church. I spent half of my school years in Catholic schools, and half in public schools. I was a quiet kid, and did not speak really unless spoken to. I had an older brother and sister, and I was the youngest for 8 1/2 years. Then my parents had another child. I was used to getting a lot of attention, and that quickly changed. Of course, the new baby needed more time and attention than me, but I felt rejected, I did not understand it all. I felt like my parents did not love me as much anymore. It was at this point in my life, I started becoming depressed quite frequently, and as time went on, I felt happiest when alone. I started to feel uncomfortable around family members, feeling like an outsider, and always felt like I was a burden to everyone.\nLater on in my childhood, I accepted the idea that I must just be a bad kid. I noticed that I did not enjoy being around my little brother, like the rest of the family did. Then I started having evil thoughts come into my mind about physically hurting my brother. This always made me sad and depressed. Because, I did not want to hurt him, I wanted to love and enjoy him like everyone else. At this time I didn’t know much about Satan and how he works to destroy anyone he can! As a teenager I was rebellious, I dove into a life centered on myself, and seeking pleasure. I smoked cigarettes, and chewed tobacco. I looked at as much pornography as possible, magazines mostly, but some XXX movies. I smoked pot, took acid, snorted cocaine, and drank alcohol heavily. I listened to the most evil heavy metal music available (Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue to name a few). I lived mostly for sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll. It was my God at the time, and my savior for a short while (it was actually, leading me quicker to my destruction). It was in these rebellious teenage years, that I started having thoughts about killing myself. I was afraid to do it, but it happened so much (thoughts), that I believed it was probably only a matter of time. I always daydreamed about people coming to my funeral, or how they would react when they found out I died. Would they cry? Would they say good things about me? By they’re reactions did they really love me?\nI didn’t really feel like living, but I certainly didn’t want to die either. At this point of my life I basically felt unworthy of anyone’s love. Sometime during my late teen xxx porn HD FREE years, or early adult years, I started a new plan. I decided being Mr. nice guy, would eventually make me happy, and solve all my problems. I tried to everything to everybody. That was ‘mission impossible’, mankind is so hard to please. This did not work, it made things worse, I became very anxious, very fearful and very insecure, and not to mention, I lost my individual personality. I got to the point where I couldn’t even make a simple decision without constant questioning. I was always worried about what others thought about me. My life got to a point to where I could not even converse with family and friends. The pressure to please (to be everything to everybody), and feeling like I was always on stage in front of an audience, was to much for me. I would even have to muster courage before calling my parents, or going somewhere with friends. After a while I totally dreaded talking on the phone, or just coming in to contact with people. One night I was talking to my mom and dad on the phone.\nI could barely speak, everything was forced and jumbled. I was terribly anxious, and so afraid to even talk to my own parents. After the terrible phone call, Satan made his big move to seal the deal, and get me to take my life (therefore sending me to an eternal hell). I started hearing in my mind, over and over, without end, KILL YOURSELF! KILL YOURSELF! KILL YOURSELF! KILL YOURSELF! At the same time I had evil violent thoughts running thru my head. I was trying to fight the thoughts (power of positive thinking), but that was fruitless, and I was losing the battle. I stopped eating, stopped sleeping, and stopped basically doing anything a normal person may expect to do. I did a lot of pacing around in fear, not knowing what to do. Mentally there were no reasoning skills whatsoever, I had absolutely no control of my mind and what went through it! I really wanted to give up, and find a way to kill myself, but every time I got real close, a thought came into to my mind, that said, you could not do that to your family. I agreed with that thought (which I know was from God), but could not figure out how in the world I could live anymore.\nMy whole life had been getting progressively worse year by year. If it got any worse, I would either totally loose my mind, hurt somebody in an uncontrollable crazy rage, or what I felt was the best option kill myself. I didn’t know, but God was getting ready to give me another option. What was it? A brand new start through His Son Jesus Christ. Let me explain. On the fourth day of Satan big offensive, I was watching t.v. I was futilely trying to take my mind of things. I was flipping the channels, flipping, flipping, flipping, finding no peace, no comfort, until it happened! I came upon TBN (note: I do not agree with most of what they do on the trinity broadcasting network, but God can even use them to help someone), and a man was about to be shot out of a canon. I stopped to watch. After he was shot out of the canon, he took his helmet off, and he started talking about his life. He talked about he had tried just about every way of living, but always felt something was missing, never had complete peace. I felt like he was reciting my own life’s story. Then he said after so many years of looking he finally had found what he was looking for.\nI was probably literally on the edge of my seat at this point. He said it was a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. He said Jesus Christ was the only one who could fill that void, and make us complete. No one but Jesus Christ could do it. Not drugs, not pleasure, not being Mr. nice guy, not family, not friends, nor anything in this whole world could do it, but Jesus! It was at this point the Holy Spirit began to move me, and I became a child of God. (After I heard the message I saw on TBN) I started reading the bible every day and praying all the time. When I decided I better start going to church again, probably a year later, I naturally went back to the Catholic Church, the only church I knew. In the event you loved this post and you wish to receive more info about xxx mom son fuck HD movies i implore you to visit our own webpage. By then I had probably read through the whole bible, and heard many messages about the Lord. When I went back to the Catholic Church, I immediately felt something was wrong, I could not articulate it, but I felt the Lord pointing out many errors, that they were teaching, that were contradicting His Word. I left that Catholic Church after about six months, and started going to a conservative Christian Church. I am now a changed man, praise be to God alone. I do not even resemble the person I was seven years ago. I have a wife and two beautiful children, I am happy even in the tough times, and I am full of hope for the future.\nI peace in all things when I realize the Lord is my shield, and that he will never leave of forsake me. The best thing is, the One who created me love me and always will. He loved me even when I was His enemy. He is truly an awesome God! My parents, sister, brother, and many other relatives are Roman Catholics. My mom said she will never leave the church, but I know our God can do what is impossible for man, and save them all. Hopefully if God is willing, he will use me to lead others to the truth which is only found in the Lord Jesus Christ of the KJV bible. I would like to mention one last thing, that all my years going to mass every Sunday, going to those Catholic schools. I never heard any gospel that would lead me to way of salvation. You would think that someone so desperately looking for a savior, would find it, if it was to be found in the Catholic church. I love all the people in Catholic church, and hope they will come to know the truth as I have and be set free! My parents, and many relatives are among those still trapped in that church, not knowing they are on the wrong path.\nI have written this testimony for the specific purpose, to let people know they cannot be saved by adhering to the teachings of the Catholic church, or by any other fruitless way of living, but only through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ! John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. And now why tarriest thou? Mark 16:16: He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Acts 22:16 Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. This verse, like Acts 2:38, again confirms that baptism is when our sins are washed away. Baptism is how we “call on the name of the Lord.” That is why when people are baptized the person who baptizes them proclaims aloud they are being baptized “into Jesus Christ” or “into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” We see in Acts 2:21,38 how closely the phrase “calling on the name of the Lord” is associated with baptism.\nThis calling on the Lord (coupled with faith and repentance) is what distinguishes baptism from merely getting wet. Ananias spoke these words to Paul three days after Jesus struck down Paul on the road to Damascus. Paul had believed and acknowledged Jesus as Lord for three days at this point in time. If belief alone brought forgiveness, then his sins would have already been washed away. Let’s take a closer look at this situation: Here is Paul, who, after having persecuted the church of Christ, is confronted by none other than Jesus Christ Himself in his glorified state. Jesus tells Paul he will be told what he must do (Acts 22:11). Jesus did not tell him what it was he must do. No, Paul would be told by someone else what it is he must do. So while waiting for three days Paul:1) had faith and believed in Jesus as the Son of God 2) fasted and prayed in repentance (Acts 9:9,11) 3) Yet his sins were still counted against him (Paul is told, “wash your sins away”) So for three days Paul was repenting and prayed. Do you think that just maybe, possibly, any of his prayers were asking God to forgive him? But when Ananias comes to him, Paul is told he still has sins that need to be washed away.\nThis is indisputable Scriptural evidence that the “sinner’s prayer” is insufficient to save someone and we are NOT saved before baptism even if we have faith and repentance! Notice also, Paul is not told to “pray for Jesus to come into your life.” He is not led in a prayer requesting salvation. No, Paul is told to “be baptized!” And the reason he was told to “be baptized” was that his sins were still counted against him–and it is in baptism that they are washed away. The servant of the Lord Jesus Christ asks Steve: How has life changed since knowing Christ? “At this time I am spending most of my time learning about the Lord, how to serve him, how to witness to others about him, and apologetics how to defend the faith against false cults (especially Catholicism). As far as spiritual gifts it seems like the Lord has mainly used me to be an encourager to brothers and sisters in the faith. He has used me to witness to a small number of people in word, but alot I know in action. I feel the Lord leading me more towards sharing the gospel boldly. The Lord also has me building a strong bond with my wife and children, that I know the Lord will use as a witness to others one day, if not even now. Again in all these things praise be to God that he could use a man like me! The Lord can use anyone if they are willing to let Him!” Peace of Christ Jesus be with you in all things, Love, Brother Steve.",

    "text": "Un nuovo video mostrerebbe prigionieri palestinesi spogliati dei loro vestiti. È stato girato allo stadio Yarmouk di Gaza City, secondo quanto ricostruito da Cnn e Sky News, che non hanno potuto verificare a quando risalgano le immagini: per la Bbc tra il 14 e il 18 dicembre, quando nelle rilevazioni satellitari della zona compaiono le tracce dei cingolati, in azione nel filmato.\nUn nuovo video mostra prigionieri palestinesi senza vestiti a Gaza City\nLe immagini sarebbero state girate allo stadio Yarmouk a metà dicembre. L’Idf a Sky News: «È necessario perquisire chi è sospettato di terrorismo»\nNella sequenza, di quasi 3 minuti, si vedono quelli che sembrano alcuni minorenni in mutande e un paio di bambini, a giudicare dalla statura, obbedire agli ordini dei soldati. La folla comprende donne velate e anziani, viene radunata sul prato.\nSfila con le mani in alto. In un frame si notano due donne bendate, inginocchiate con le mani dietro la schiena, sotto la porta da calcio, sulla traversa c’è una bandiera israeliana. In un altro, sei file di uomini seduti e inginocchiati, con le braccia dietro il torso.\nIl video è stato\ncaricato su YouTube il 24 dicembre dal fotografo YoSee Gamzoo Letova, che al Corriere\nha confermato di essere l’autore. «Al momento sono in una zona di guerra nel pieno di una battaglia», dice tramite WhatsApp. Il 19 dicembre scriveva sul suo profilo Facebook di essere andato embedded\ncon i «guerrieri eroici» della brigata Nachal.\nIn un video pubblicato il 21 dicembre si intravede già lo stadio dove, secondo la ong Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, l’Idf avrebbe arrestato centinaia di civili, «inclusi bambini fino a 10 anni e ultrasettantenni».\nL’esercito israeliano, interpellato da Sky News , non ha negato l’autenticità del filmato. La replica: a essere fermati sono i sospettati di terrorismo, dopo gli interrogatori comincerebbero i rilasci. «Sono trattati in accordo alla legge internazionale», che nel caso dei bambini prevede (nella Convenzione di Ginevra e nei proto-colli aggiuntivi del 1977) però tutele speciali.\n«È spesso necessario che i sospettati consegnino i vestiti perché le perquisizioni escludano la presenza di cinture esplosive o altre armi», aggiunge l’Idf. Gli abiti «non sono restituiti subito ai prigionieri», prima vengono ispezionati. In uno scorcio del video si vedono alcuni vestiti appesi sugli spalti o adagiati in cima alle recinzioni.\nIl 7 dicembre avevano iniziato a circolare online\n altre immagini che mostravano alcuni uomini catturati dalle truppe israeliane nel nord della Striscia: bendati, genuflessi, anche loro spogliati dei vestiti e circondati dai soldati dell’Idf. La prima versione, avvalorata dai media israeliani, è che si trattasse di miliziani di Hamas che si erano arresi. La Cnn, dopo le verifiche, aveva sostenuto di poter escludere che fossero tutti miliziani: alcuni di loro sarebbero stati invece civili, non affiliati a a gruppi jihadisti.\nCorriere della Sera è anche su Whatsapp. È sufficiente\ncliccare qui per iscriversi al canale ed essere sempre aggiornati.\n28 dicembre 2023 (modifica il 28 dicembre 2023 | 21:53)\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "text": "By Ann Marie Welser ,\n3 hours ago\nAcross Chicago, bakeries are seeing an uptick in pie orders. Pi Day, or March 14, is a celebration of the mathematical constant used to measure the circumference of a circle. For Hoosier Mama Pie Company, the holiday also marks another milestone.\n“It’s Pi Day; the best day of the year and it’s also our 15th anniversary of opening today,” said Olivia Sweets, Pastry Chef and General Manager of Hoosier Mama Pie.\nSweets began baking as a child with her mom during the holidays. Now, she runs the West Town bakery which was packed with customers as slices of pies flew off the shelves. From Maple Bacon to Matcha Custard, the local bakery specializes in a variety of artisanal pies made by scratch.\n“Whenever you get a pie from us, almost all of our bakers have had a hand in it,” said Sweets.\nOn a normal Thursday, Sweets said the bakery goes through around 50 pies. Today, her team has baked nearly 500. The preparation for the holiday began last week and the group of bakers worked tirelessly to make hundreds of pies.\n“You’re getting something that we’ve all come together and collaborated on as a team to make for you which I think is one of the coolest things about making pies,” said Sweets.\nThe phenomenon surrounding Pi Day seems as infinite as its digits. Today also marks Albert Einstein's birthday and the anniversary of Stephen Hawking's death. Whether you’re a math enthusiast or just very passionate about sweets, Happy Pi Day!\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Share Brian Everstine April 02, 2025 The L3Harris Vampire counter-drone system.\nCredit: L3Harris L3Harris later this year will conduct the first test of its platform-agnostic mobile counter-drone system at sea, after years of using it effectively in Ukraine.\nThe company quickly developed and deployed the Vehicle-Agnostic Modular Palletized ISR Equipment (Vampire) system to launch laser-guided, 2.75-in. Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System rockets at incoming drones and sent more than a dozen of the vehicle-mounted systems to Ukraine. Vampire uses a Wescam MX-10D multisensor, multispectral targeting system on a tower to detect the drones and target the rocket, with the goal of using the relatively cheap APKWS instead of much more expensive air defense missiles.\nTom Kirkland, vice president and general manager of targeting and sensor systems at L3Harris, told reporters April 2 that the company is planning its first test of Vampire at sea in the late second quarter or early third quarter of this fiscal year. The company already has integrated the electro-optical infrared sensor system at sea, and “now we’re just moving into the full integration of the entire system onto a maritime platform.”\nVampire is in regular use in Ukraine and is effectively downing drones, though the company would not provide specifics on how many are still in use since the first deployment in 2023.\n“Since that time, we have been relentless in innovating our counter unmanned technology,” Kirkland says.\nThe Navy is deploying new counter-UAS systems to protect its ships, including integrating the Raytheon Coyote and Anduril Roadrunner on the USS Winston Churchill guided-missile destroyer, alongside the ship’s Standard Missile-2 and Aegis system.\nL3Harris also is looking beyond APKWS for Vampire, seeking to integrate fire-and-forget missiles and rockets onto it, Kirkland says.\nBrian Everstine Brian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.\nL3Harris Technologies UAS Ukraine war Related Content Airbus To Pit Missile-Armed Target Drones Against Loitering Munitions UK To Lead Counter UAS Trials, Install Lasers On Type 45 Warships U.S. Air Force Studies LAIRCM Replacement For Large Aircraft Fleet Australia Fields Himars After Fast-Tracking Effort Debrief: Building ‘What Already Works’ For Golden Dome Defense Digest Get free defense news, insight and analysis from our award-winning editors delivered to your inbox daily.\nSubscribe Now",
