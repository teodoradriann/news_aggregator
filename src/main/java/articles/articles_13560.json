    "text": "An international children's rights organization has called for an arms embargo on Israel, citing the regime’s massacre of women and children in Gaza. The call by Save the Children UK came on Thursday after a recent Israeli airstrike killed nearly a dozen women and children, including a group of ten-year-old quadruplets, and their mother. “We’re absolutely heartbroken to see that six children – including a group of ten-year-old quadruplets, and their mother – are the latest victims of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza,” Save The Children UK said on X. “We simply cannot accept the violence that Palestinian children continue to face as normal.” We're absolutely heartbroken to see that six children - including a group of ten-year-old quadruplets, and their mother are the latest victims of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.— Save the Children UK (@savechildrenuk) We simply cannot accept the violence that Palestinian children continue to face as normal. [https://t.co/f9h9tercHh] [August 22, 2024] The rights organization urged the British government to immediately stop selling arms to the Tel Aviv regime. It said there is a clear risk that weapons sold to Israel might be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law. The new development came after a group of international rights organizations launched legal action to stop UK arms sales to Israel over the regime’s war crimes in Gaza. The UK has continued arms supplies to Israel despite the ongoing genocide in Gaza, issuing more than 100 arms export licenses since last October. Israel has hit more than 500 Gaza schools in the past 10 months, according to an Al Jazeera report as schools in the Gaza Strip have been used to shelter nearly two million displaced Palestinians. Within 10 days in August, the regime's military forces struck five schools in Gaza City, killing more than 179 people and injuring scores more. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, schools are considered civilian objects and should be protected from attacks. The Israeli regime has killed more than 40,223 and wounded 92,981 Palestinians since the regime launched its campaign of death and destruction in Gaza on October 7, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

    "title": "Dak Prescott Hints at Cowboys Departure Amid Contract Drama",
    "text": "By Benedetto Vitale ,\n7 hours ago The Dallas Cowboys have several key players in need of a new contract by next season, one of them being star quarterback Dak Prescott. While talking with the media, Prescott hinted at a potential departure from Dallas.\nPrescott made it clear that he wants to remain with the Cowboys for the long haul. But he is also being realistic about his contract situation, according to Jett Beachum of CBS News Texas. The business aspect of the NFL could ultimately play a role in Prescott's future in the league.\n\"I want to be here, but when you look up -- all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams. ... That's not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.\"\nPrescott, who will turn 31 on July 29, is due to hit free agency after the 2024 season. He can certainly continue playing at a high level for several more years.\nWith that said, Jerry Jones and the Cowboys have difficult decisions to make. Prescott isn't the only player on the roster in need of an extension, as wide receiver CeeDee Lamb is also in the final year of his contract. Linebacker Micah Parsons has a strong case for a payday as well. And then there's coach Mike McCarthy, who is not under contract beyond 2024.\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) reacts during the first half against the Green Bay Packers for the 2024 NFC wild card game at AT&T Stadium. © Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports\nPrescott has been a relatively consistent quarterback throughout his career. He doesn't turn the ball over much, and the Cowboys have been successful with him leading the way. But the franchise is starving for a Super Bowl, as Dallas hasn't won a championship since the 1995 season.\nGiven his public comments, it's unclear what Jones and the Cowboys plan to do about Prescott's contract. For all we know, he could be hitting the free agency market next offseason. But if he has another stellar season, Dallas may feel it's necessary to re-sign him at a massive price tag.\nRelated: Rich Eisen Turns Heads Naming NFL's Top 5 Sleeper Teams, Surprise Playoff Prediction\nRelated: Titans QB Will Levis is Blowing Minds With 'Impressive' Development at Training Camp\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

You said to me 'Zohar, I want you to be happy and joyful.' How can I be happy, my love? You are the living spirit in our home. We had so many dreams together.

Peace in Ukraine after the war with Russia must be just and based on the international order. The Bulgarian Prime Minister said this in an interview with [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/01/17/bulgaria-pm-ukraine-is-fighting-for-europe.html) at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, January 18. At the same time, he noted that Europe must be \"united to be strong.\" Answering a journalist's question about how European leaders could convince Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to support Ukraine, Denkov said that \"logical arguments\" should be used. One such argument is that the war in Ukraine started by Russia should end as soon as possible on fair terms, not on Moscow's demands. \"We do not need any other peace rather than a just, fair and consistent with the international order. This is the only way it can be sustainable. If Hungary is isolated in this process, it will create problems for this country, not just for Europe. Therefore, I believe that the states located on the eastern flank, in particular Hungary, will benefit from being united in this matter,\" Denkov emphasized.

    "text": "EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — As the borderland mobilizes to provide supplies and support to the people affected and the crews fighting the Ruidoso wildfires, one man shared his story of how he is helping by rescuing horses. KFOX14/CBS4 caught up with self-described \"regular cowboy\" William Molinar outside a Walmart in far east El Paso, as he was loading crates of water bottles and Gatorade products into his truck. Molinar said he's taking the drinks to Ruidoso to hand them out to fire crews and first responders. However, this isn't Molinar's first trip. Since the disaster started, Molinar has taken around six to seven trips wrangling horses out of harm's way and reuniting them with their owners. “If I can make somebody's day better or an animal's life better then I'm able to do it. No matter if I have money or not I'm going to go out of my way to do it,” said Molinar. Transporting two to three horses at a time, Molinar said he has rescued a little over a dozen horses, placing them in safe nearby ranches or stables in Albuquerque and Sunland Park before reuniting them with their owners. RELATED: [List of resources for victims of Ruidoso wildfires](/news/local/list-of-resources-for-victims-of-ruidoso-wildfires-new-mexico-salt-fire-south-fork-fire-american-red-cross#?src=link) Molinar added that the horses he has rescued have been noticeably scarred by the situation. Molinar said they are sensitive creatures, requiring patience. “If you're calm and patient and trying to take care of them, make sure they’re okay, then they calm a little bit down, but yeah you have to be very careful and patient with these horses,” said Molinar. Molinar mission is a team effort, as he explained his trips have been fueled by donations. “Without El Paso, Las Cruces, Tularosa—everybody that donated I wouldn’t have done without them. So, my respects to them, without them, I can’t do this,” said Molinar. Molinar said he plans to continue to go on his horse-saving runs until donations dry out, adding that after the fires die down, he will ride around the area to wrangle stray horses that might still be roaming the area scared after surviving the South Fork and Salt fires.
