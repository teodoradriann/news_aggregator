    "text": "Builder awarded $20,000 after WeChat dismissal A builder who was let go from his job when the company employing him ran out of work has been awarded more than $20,000 by the Employment Relations Authority. Liuju Wang was described as an experienced builder and joiner by the authority. He took a job with Y&L Building in late May 2022. He started out on $38 an hour but that increased to $40 when he took a permanent role. En Cun Ye, the company’s director, had Wang’s work visa transferred over to his company. Having an employer linked to his visa was a requirement for Wang to be able to stay in the country. But a day after that happened, Ye messaged Yang on WeChat telling him that there was no more work available and he should find another company to work for. Wang did not return to his job from that point, saying he was actively looking for other work. He got another job three weeks later but went to the Employment Relations Authority claiming unjustified disadvantage and unjustified dismissal and seeking remedies of compensation for lost income, distress and hurts, costs and reimbursement of costs associated with his visa. For his part, Ye sad it was only fair he let Wang know in advance he would not be able to continue to offer full-time hours as they had agreed. He told Wang on WeChat that the company was about to go bankrupt. Ye told the authority his business was a framing subcontractor and when he employed Yang he had a stream of work lined up. But in late July last year he discovered a job he had expected would not be going ahead. He said he felt it was fairer to tell his staff as soon as possible. Wang’s final pay was on August 2. Messages showed that he was asked if he could work on a number of occasions but declined, because, he said, he did not see any point going to work knowing his job was going to end and he was better to use his time finding a new job. He started with his new employer in late August. Authority member Claire English said it was clear that Wang had been dismissed by Ye, and she accepted what Ye said about the sudden and unexpected loss of work leaving him with limited options. “I also accept that it was fairer of him to warn employees in advance, as he did. However, this is still a dismissal, even if it is done for genuine reasons.” She said he might not have realised it was a dismissal because there were no performance or behaviour concerns. But she said it was arguable he did not sufficiently investigate all the circumstances before telling Wang his job was about to end. “In addition, Ye did not raise the concerns he had with Wang before deciding to dismiss him. Instead, he told Wang of his concerns, that there would be no more work after the conclusion of the current job, and instead of asking Wang to respond Ye immediately moved to dismissal before discussing other possible solutions with Wang. “Together, these two things meant that Wang was dismissed before he had time to consider his position or think about what he wanted to do next. It also meant that even though Ye later found more work, by this time, Wang had already been dismissed. Wang was aware that the company had not closed as had been indicated on 21 July and that others continued to work for Ye, and this also meant that he felt he had been misled and what he had been told was not genuine, which is unfortunate.” She said he had been unjustifiably dismissed. She said he was owed $5120 in lost wages as the equivalent of the three weeks and one day between his job ending and starting a new one. She also accepted his account of the impact of the dismissal on him. He said he was devastated, had to seek help from family and friends in China and was still emotionally affected by it. She said it was appropriate to award $20,000 compensation. But she reduced the compensation component by 10% because he had turned down requests to work.",

    "text": "This year, we need the inspiration of Easter to follow Jesus' example of healing and hope 3-minute read The Pulaski Skyway is one of the worst roadways in the state. There are no shoulders and only one midway off-ramp. Any accident or car breakdown can back up traffic for miles for well over an hour. Instead of fuming while driving east, take a gander at the skylines in front of you. New York City still dominates, but New Jersey is giving it a run for the money. But what you can pick out on this side of the Hudson are the church steeples that still stick out of the skyline despite the many new high-rises. When those churches — like the now closed St. Michael’s Monastery in Union City or still active St. Aedan’s in Jersey City — were built, they were the first “skyscrapers.” St. John the Baptist’s steeple was the tallest structure in Jersey City when it was built in 1897. There’s a reason they point upward, reminding us that heaven is our final destination. And that’s the reason on Easter Sunday most Catholic and Christian churches will be packed, or at least filled more than ordinary Sundays. It is perhaps the most joyful Sunday liturgy of the church year. In fact, every Sunday is often referred to as a “little” Easter Sunday. The Triduum — three days — leading up to Easter is among the richest ritual celebrations in Christianity. It’s what makes us Christians — Jesus suffered and died to conquer death forever. It gives us a vision of the salvation that defies despair and inspires hope. When I am stuck on the Skyway, I also look on either side and can pick out all the local churches. One is Holy Rosary, an Italian-American parish in downtown Jersey City, where I grew up and found my priestly vocation. The modest-sized church has more colorful, lifelike statues than almost any other church I’ve visited; it’s an Italian custom. One statue, which I had never seen elsewhere, showed Jesus laid in the tomb. He was horizontal, not vertical. Years later I found a replica in a religious article shop and bought it. It brings back memories of the religious devotions, novenas, all-night vigils and Masses I attended throughout my formative years. Though the statues were inanimate, they animated a congregation that found comfort in church because everyone from the neighborhood was there. While we gathered to hear Mass or sing and pray, the gathering strengthened the community where we lived our daily lives in the blocks around the church. And it was intergenerational. Senior citizens, parents, families and all the “characters” we would encounter on the streets would come together as one. And the priests were really our “Fathers” in the way they cared for us through so many activities and events sponsored year-round in the parish. They would come to class in the grammar school, sit on the desk and talk to us about life and faith. Many adult Christians carry warm and good memories of church. Even though more young adults today are checking “Nones” — or unaffiliated — their parents and older relatives may have had different experiences of church. Even if less consistent weekly church attendance is more common today, there is something about the lure of Easter that can pack people into the pews. And it has to do with harnessing hope and bringing it back into our daily lives. Opinion: [This is how Easter can move us from hate to hope](/story/opinion/2023/04/05/easter-2023-we-can-move-from-hate-to-hope/70079056007/) The empty tomb could have been a killer until Mary Magdalene — the misidentified feminist and preeminent apostle — and other women disciples found it and heralded it to the male apostles: Jesus had risen. They did not believe her and her companions and ran to see it for themselves. What could this mean? Was he alive? Will we see him? Now we know and believe in his Resurrection. Despite all the persecution and crucifixion, the disciples would learn that Jesus was still with them. And the Gospels bring that reality into our lives today. This salient message of triumph of life over death inspires so many people all over the world to carry on Jesus’ mission of healing and helping. And don’t we live in a world and a country that need to celebrate that message. Wars are killing hundreds of thousands of people in the last two years alone. Our country is torn apart by the desecration of democracy to prop up a would-be demagogue. Unity is sparse and hatred is rearing its ugly head toward minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals and oppressed peoples in Gaza and many third world countries. Easter is an antidote to despair. We need to heal and move beyond division to find a way to get along. Hearing Easter messages from the pulpit, varied as they are, is what we need to live on. This is the comfort of Easter church.

Get out of your head. Who cares if your shoe falls off? Who cares if you forget a lyric?’” she said. “Honestly, it’s just about being able to be up there and be vulnerable and that feels really beautiful.”\nJessica Simpson. (Photo by James Devaney/GC Images) In May, Simpson stepped out for her first TV performance in 15 years, singing at the Season 23 American Idol finale.\nEarlier this year, Simpson released her comeback EP, Nashville Canyon: Pt. 1 , and part two is slated for release on September 4, 2025.\nThe pop star alludes to her marriage troubles with ex-husband Eric Johnson in the lyrics of several songs.\nAmong these songs is “Leave,” which includes the lyrics: “What we had was magic / Now you made it tragic / Giving her what you gave to me / Now the well that you drank from’s empty.”\nRelated: Jessica Simpson and Eric Johnson ‘Want Different Things’: Source For months, there was speculation of trouble in Jessica Simpson’s marriage to husband Eric Johnson. They’ve both been spotted without their wedding rings on multiple occasions and — in an out-of-character move for Simpson — neither noted their 10th wedding anniversary in August 2024 on social media. Simpson, 44, also failed to acknowledge Johnson’s 45th […] Simpson and Johnson separated after 10 years of marriage earlier this year. After dating for several years, the former couple tied the knot at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California in 2014. The pair share three children, Maxwell, 12, Ace, 11, and Birdie, 5.\n“Eric and I have been living separately, navigating a painful situation in our marriage,” Simpson, who began dating Johnson in 2010, told Us Weekly in a statement in January. “Our children come first, and we are focusing on what is best for them. We are grateful for all of the love and support that has been coming our way, and appreciate privacy right now as we work through this as a family.”",
