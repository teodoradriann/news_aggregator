    "title": "Stellantis, nuovo stop dello stabilimento di Mirafiori. Il monito: le vetture non basta produrle, bisogna anche venderle",
    "text": "Non c’è pace sull’automotive. Le notizie poco liete arrivano a grappoli e lo scenario sembra fosco in tutto il Continente. In Germania si attendono con preoccupazione la manovre del Gruppo Volkswagen che ormai ha una necessità impellente di tagliare i costi e il sacrificio di qualche stabilimento appare ormai necessario per salvaguardare il funzionamento aziendale. Il cielo non è certo più sereno da questa parte delle Alpi e ieri è arrivata la comunicazione di un’ulteriore stop delle attività produttive di Mirafiori. La speranza è nelle nuove attività che potrebbero portare ossigeno, come la realizzazione delle trasmissioni automatiche per vetture ibride eDCT e l’impianto di economia circolare. Le vetture, infatti, sembrano impantanate e non è così facile tirarle fuori dall’impasse. Nella fabbrica torinese si realizzano infatti la 500 elettrica e le Maserati che non attraggono più i consensi del mercato visto che le vendite sono crollate. Almeno nella Penisola dove la penetrazione del marchio Fiat è sempre stata forte e le richieste interne ritenute fondamentali per il successo del modello ed il funzionamento della relativa fabbrica che lo realizza. Per quanto riguarda i prodotti del Tridente non si è ancora placata la polemica per una mail aziendale inviata ai dipendenti per l’acquisto a prezzi agevolati. I sindacati e parte della politica sono insorti perché l’offerta è alquanto fuori luogo, fatta ad operai che non attraversano un momento facile per vetture di lusso decisamente fuori portata. Lo stock della baby Fiat BEV è sufficiente per soddisfare le poche richieste d’acquisto e la produzione è stata fermata per un altro mese, almeno fino all’11 ottobre. La frenata è stata quasi improvvisa. La vettura è ancora recente e spinta da brand (Fiat e 500) da sempre apprezzatissimi nel nostro paese. Anche la più recente 600e, che pur non è prodotta in Italia, non è decollata ed in quasi nove mesi è stata scelta da poco più di 600 clienti italiani. Non si tratta del fiacco mercato elettrico che non tira perché la nuovissima Fiat è preceduta in classifica da 15 modelli a batteria, molti dei quali più costosi ed esclusivi. Con la transizione il mercato è diventato ancora più difficile da interpretare, anche nel breve termine. Intanto i rappresentati dei lavoratori si agitano giustamente e chiedono un incontro Stellantis-Governo per affrontare la situazione.",

    "text": "Bien qu’elle reste peu connue, la pluie d’étoiles filantes des Quadrantides est l’une des plus intenses de l’année. En 2024, il sera possible de voir jusqu’à 200 météores par heure dans la nuit du 3 au 4 janvier. Pour bien commencer l’année, rien de tel que de s’installer confortablement pour observer les étoiles filantes. La première pluie d’étoiles filantes de l’année est celle des Quadrantides, dont la période d’activité s’étend du 26 décembre au 16 janvier. Pendant cette période, la Terre rencontre l’essaim des Quadrantides, provenant de la comète Konzik-Peltier, selon des informations de [Science et Vie](https://www.science-et-vie.com/ciel-et-espace/les-quadrantides-une-pluie-detoiles-filantes-breve-mais-intense-121940.html). Jusqu’à 200 étoiles filantes par heure Cette année, le pic d’activité de la pluie d’étoiles filantes aura lieu dans la nuit du 3 au 4 janvier. En moyenne, il est possible de voir environ 80 météores par heure mais selon l’ [Organisation Météorologique Internationale](https://www.imo.net/resources/calendar/), jusqu’à 200 étoiles filantes pourraient être observées cette année. Pour profiter du spectacle, il ne faudra pas être en retard car l’essaim des Quadrantides est très concentré et dense, et la période d’activité ne s’étendra que sur une durée de 6 heures. Comme le précise [Star Walk](https://starwalk.space/fr/news/quadrantid-meteor-shower), bien qu’elle soit moins connue que les autres, la pluie d’étoiles filantes des Quadrantides est l’une des plus prometteuses et intenses de l’année, aux côtés des Perséides et des Géminides. Pour observer pleinement le spectacle, il est conseillé de s’éloigner de la pollution lumineuse et de s’installer dans un endroit sombre, à la campagne, pour profiter d’un ciel dégagé. Pensez à vous couvrir de vêtements chauds, installez-vous confortablement et laissez vos yeux s’habituer à la pénombre. Enfin, n’oubliez pas de faire un vœu, qui se réalisera peut-être en 2024.",

    "text": "Truus Wijsmuller, or “Auntie Truus” as she was also known, dedicated her life to helping children affected by WWII. She was energetic, cheeky, and fearless — even when facing the Gestapo.\nBorn in Alkmaar in 1896, Truus was the daughter of a drugstore worker and a self-employed dressmaker. In 1913, she moved to Amsterdam with her family.\nThere, her parents not only taught her to help people in need but set an example by taking in a homeless Austrian boy after the First World War.\nREAD MORE | Meet Mata Hari: the famous Dutch First World War spy\nSome years after moving to Amsterdam, Truus fell in love with Joop Wijsmuller and the couple married in 1922.\nHowever, when they discovered that they couldn’t have kids, Truus decided to dedicate herself to helping the children of others instead.\nThrough social work, Truus unknowingly began her journey towards becoming a resistance heroine.\nThe beginning of her resistance work Besides her social work, Truus was also very politically involved. 💭\nThe combination of her hard work in these two areas and her general good-hearted nature earned her the respect of many.\nThanks to these attributes, she could rely on an extensive network of people when she began her resistance work in 1933.\nTruus Wijsmuller with a rabbi in 1962. Image: Ben van Meerendonk /WikimediaCommons/ CC2.0 Her first endeavour was to travel to Jewish acquaintances in Germany and bring their children safely to the Netherlands.\nAfter Kristallnacht (The Night of Broken Glass) in 1938, she went to the Dutch-German border having heard rumours of lost children wandering about in the forest.\nREAD MORE | The 14-year-old assassin who lured Nazis and traitors to their deaths\nThere, she found a Yiddish-speaking Polish boy. In order to avoid being caught, she smuggled him across the border and into the Netherlands.\nHow, you might ask? Under her skirt! 👗\n“Truus was our guardian angel.. she gave me my life. That’s the reason I am here,” said Philip de Groot , who was saved by Truus as a child.\nEngland comes calling Having been involved in rescuing Jewish children from Germany for years, Truus’ operation became more extensive at the end of the 1930s.\nIn November 1938, the British government decided to provide temporary refuge for Jewish children who lived in countries under Nazi control.\nHaving made a name for herself, Truus was asked to help with the operation. 🤝\nTruus was requested to go to Germany and meet with Otto Adolf Eichmann (who later played a major role in the organisation of the Holocaust).\nREAD MORE | Laureen Nussbaum talks about her friend Anne Frank, the Holocaust and taking responsibility\nAt the time, Eichmann was the official in charge of the forced emigration of Jews from Germany and Austria. Fearlessly, she agreed.\nAn impossible task On December 11, 1938, Truus met with Eichmann to arrange for the emigration of Jewish children to England via the Netherlands.\nWhen she arrived at the meeting, she had expected to negotiate how many children she could bring back with her on her first trip.\nHowever, Eichmann refused all negotiations and instead gave her a challenge.\nHe charged her with the care of 600 Jewish children, believing it would be an impossible task and that her operation was doomed to fail.\nHe couldn’t have been more wrong.\nTruus Wijsmuller was responsible for saving thousands of Jewish children through the #KinderTransport and may have saved the most lives of all during the #Holocaust . She is a #RighteousJew and has a tree planted in her honor in #YadVashem . #NeverForget pic.twitter.com/j7qRNRtFUa\n— Stephen Uzzell (@StephenUzzell2) January 14, 2021 Getting to work immediately, Truus managed to bring all 600 children out of Austria.\nWithin a few days, 500 of the children had safely arrived in England via Hoek van Holland, while 100 stayed in the Netherlands. Take that, Eichmann — never underestimate a woman! 💪\nREAD MORE | Being a feminist in the Netherlands: surprisingly, it’s a challenge\nTruus continued this work until the outbreak of the war, bringing 150 children to safety each time she travelled between England and the Netherlands.\nEven more impressively, she organised the transport of these children without any support from the Dutch government. They were too busy being not-so-happy about her work.\nPrior to the war, the country didn’t want to offend Nazi Germany. Plus, in 1938 the Netherlands was already struggling to accommodate a high influx of refugees.\nTruus, therefore, relied mainly on her own network to transport the children through the Netherlands.\nRefugee children housed at Amsterdam orphanage Although most of the children were supposed to go to England, many ended up staying in the Netherlands.\nFrom March 1939, these children were housed at an orphanage in Amsterdam called the Burgerweeshuis (now the Amsterdam Museum ).\nBoth Truus and her husband Joop spent much of their time with the children from the Burgerweeshuis .\nThey even let children stay in their own homes for small periods of time to provide them with more gezellig surroundings. Joop also took children with him on trips to the ARTIS zoo in Amsterdam.\nThe children from the Burgerweeshuis. Source: Overwijsmuller /Wikimedia Commons/ CC4.0 “The Burgerweeshuis was, because of Mrs Wijsmuller, the only place where so many children were rescued,” said Rita Mayer-Brown , who was saved by Truus as a child.\nWith the amount of love that she and her husband dedicated, it’s no surprise that an obituary after her death in 1978 read, “Mother of 1001 children, who made saving Jewish children her life’s task.”\nHowever, in May 1940, the Netherlands was occupied by Nazi Germany.\nTruus was in Paris at the time but instantly dropped everything to return to the Netherlands.\nTime was ticking, but she managed to pull off the impressive feat of evacuating the Burgerweeshuis children to England before it was too late.\nContinued to work illegally under occupation Truus moved to Belgium during the German occupation of the Netherlands. From there, she continued her work illegally, though on a different scale.\nREAD MORE | 7 unmissable movies about the Netherlands in WWII\nShe began working with the Dutch, the Belgian, and the French Red Cross. Aside from continuing to smuggle children to safety, she also smuggled packages with essentials such as medicine, food, and clothing to refugee camps in southern France. ⛑\nWhenever possible, she would reunite the children with their families.\nArrested by the Gestapo In May 1942, Truus was arrested by the Gestapo upon entering the Netherlands. They suspected that she was helping Jews get safely to Switzerland (you bet she was!), but they couldn’t prove her guilty.\nThankfully, the refugees that the Gestapo had gotten hold of only knew her by her alias, and she was released after a few days.\nAn unstoppable woman Neither war, occupation, nor being arrested by the Gestapo could make Truus stop her resistance work.\nAll throughout the war, she continued to do everything in her power to help children in need.\nEven after the war ended , Truus continued making an impact as social policy became an important focus for her when she returned to an active role in politics after the war.\nOverlooked for decades, Truus Wijsmuller is finally beginning to get the recognition she deserves.\nA documentary called Truus’ Children premiered on NPO (Dutch Foundation for Public Broadcasting) in May 2020 and can now also be found on Netflix.\n“Truus did not only save me, she saved the three generations after me as well,” said Hannele Scheinowitz , who was saved by Truus as a child.",

    "text": "As the year comes to an end, I’m taking a look back at where we’ve been and sharing the highlights. Last week, I shared [moments from the first half of 2024.](https://wp.me/p7ShJJ-LtyM) Here are the rest:\nIn July, a reader begged for help in reclaiming her home. Maureen Rabazinski, a 62-year-old nurse practitioner, and her husband’s empty nest home had been repopulated as their two adult sons — and three grandkids and their toys — moved home during various life transitions, taking over guest rooms and turning her home office into a nursery.\nLesson: The advice I offered Maureen is something we all can benefit from: Every home needs boundaries, and every room needs one clearly defined purpose, no more. The office should not double as a nursery.\nIn August, I was planning my third wedding in eight years. Not all mine, thank goodness. Though we’ve been lucky in love, my girls and I, it’s been an expensive decade. I’m not the only one dealing with sticker shock. According to The Wedding Report, the price tab for the average U.S. wedding last year was over $30,000.\nLesson: Because no one wants to begrudge a bride a memorable wedding day, I found dozens of ways to save hundreds, even thousands of dollars by cutting costs in imperceptible ways. Here’s a sampling: Keep the guest list tight. Go with large blooms of in-season flowers. Pass on the champagne toast; have guests raise the drink they have in hand to cheer the newlyweds. And just say no to favors.\nIn September, thanks to the kindness of strangers, one deserving family achieved the American dream of homeownership. Maynor and Leticia Aldana moved out of their slum-like apartment, which had sewage leaking into the kitchen, and into a newly renovated house in Northfield, Minn. Their monthly mortgage payment is now less than they were paying in rent. With the help of their local Habitat for Humanity, Bob Thacker and his wife bought a dilapidated 1,200 square-foot townhouse, then teamed up with more than 100 local volunteers — framers, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, designers and master gardeners — and worked alongside Leticia and Maynor to renovate the home.\nLesson: Never underestimate the power of a community with a goal or the power of people and how much they want to help.\nIn October, I saw what happens when a world-class design firm, with a soft spot for helping those with disabilities, and a leading furniture retailer join forces. The result: Quietly Accessible Furniture. Recognizing that age isn’t easy on us but that the right furniture can make it easier, and help prevent falls, Michael Graves Design and Pottery Barn launched a furniture line that looks like it belongs in a home not a rehab center.\nLesson: More than three-fourths of those over age 50 say they want to age in place. Thankfully, furniture is becoming available that looks residential, not medical or institutional, allowing them to do just that.\nIn November, we met the “Heirloomist.” Photographer Shana Novak captures special keepsakes on film to “make something seemingly ordinary feel magical.” Ticket stubs, keys, pregnancy sticks, a faded airline boarding pass, teddy bears, worn-out work boots, and muddy slobbered-on tennis balls are among the ordinary but dear items Novak has dignified through photography and in her new book “The Heirloomist — 100 Treasures and the Stories They Tell,” (Chronicle Books).\nLesson: Most of us think an heirloom is a cherished valuable relic from an ancient relative, but an heirloom can be anything, expensive or humble, as long as it tells your story, a story you want to keep alive for generations.\nIn December, I started breathing easier and sneezing less after I investigated ways to bust the fur flying around my home and other unwelcome evidence of our two dogs — including their, ahem, aroma. Initially skeptical of home air purifiers, because you have to believe in what you can’t see, namely that they eliminate 99.7% of invisible toxins in our air, such as pollen, dust, dander, mold, viruses, bacteria, and odors from cooking, tobacco smoke and pets, I was dubious. But as I saw independent studies, including ones from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, supporting the claims, I got a portable air purifier, and became a believer.\nLesson: Take care of your air. While this and many other home design columns focus on how homes look, just as —or even more— important, may be how our homes smell. Here’s to clearing the air and cleaner living in 2025!\nMarni Jameson has written seven books, including “Downsizing the Family Home.” Reach her at marni@marnijameson.com.",

Congress MPs provided him with a chair, and he was eventually assisted back to the House by his colleagues. \"With great difficulty and with the support of my colleagues, I limped to the House at 11 am,\" he noted in his letter to the Speaker of Lok Sabha Om Birla.\nHe charged the BJP of holding “lathis,” and demanded a probe into the incident.\nExpressing serious concern over the violent incidents, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the injured MPs and inquired about their health.\nHe also demanded a probe into it. On the other hand, the demand for making cctv footage was also increasing.\nFormer Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot alleged that the BJP MPs stopped the leaders of opposition and other MPs of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha from entering Parliament and condemned the incident. Gehlot said Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla should investigate the incident \"as soon as possible\" and take action against the guilty BJP MPs.\nHe said it is surprising that the security personnel of Parliament did not intervene during this time and alleged it seems it was a conspiracy of the BJP to divert attention from the issue of insult of Babasaheb Ambedkar by Home Minister Amit Shah.",
