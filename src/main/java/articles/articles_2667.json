    "text": "Five players on Australia's women's water polo team for the Paris Olympics tested positive for COVID-19 this week. Paris is the first Olympics since the Tokyo Summer Games in 2021 and Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 were staged in COVID bubbles with rigorous testing protocols.Video above: A look at what it's like getting around Paris ahead of the 2024 OlympicsSo, what are the protocols for positive tests at the Games this year? A Paris 2024 spokesperson told CNN that the protocols recommend mask-wearing for people who test positive.“We regularly remind athletes and all other Games stakeholders of the good practices to adopt should they experience any respiratory symptoms: wearing a mask in the presence of others, limiting contacts and washing hands regularly with soap and water or using hand sanitiser,” the statement says.“Hand sanitiser stations can be found at all the residential areas and also the restaurant of the Olympic Village,” according to the statement. “We continue to carefully monitor the public health situation in France, in conjunction with the relevant government ministry.”Many of the national teams also may have their own safety protocols to protect their athletes, said Lucia Mullen, an associate scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a member of the World Health Organization’s mass gathering expert group, which regularly works on these issues.“For the COVID-19 cases, as with other respiratory diseases and also other gastrointestinal diseases, they will really promote hand hygiene and other basic hygiene measures – so, keeping distance, reporting to the clinics to get tested if you are feeling unwell and certainly if you’re displaying symptoms,” Mullen said. “Then, of course, isolating if you do test positive.”The Australian water polo team is treating COVID-19 no differently than any other respiratory illness, said Anna Meares, the chef de mission for the Australian Olympic team.“This is a high-performance environment, so we are being diligent,” Meares said at a news conference Tuesday when the team’s first COVID-19 case was announced.“We’re also having the fellow teammates wear masks and just adhere to social distancing measures as well – meeting outside, those sorts of things,” she said.She added that, when respiratory illnesses occur, the person is isolated until their symptoms subside and testing comes back clear.“But I need to emphasize that we are treating COVID no differently to other bugs like the flu. This is not Tokyo,” Meares said, referring to the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games, which were delayed by a year due to the pandemic and held without in-person spectators.Although the world is no longer under a public health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Olympic Games come as a wave of COVID-19 infections has hit the United States. Even President Joe Biden recently tested positive for the disease.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that, if you test positive for COVID-19, you stay home until you are fever-free without the help of fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours and your symptoms have been improving for 24 hours. It then recommends wearing a mask around other people for the next five days.“We’re in a time period where COVID is still circulating. We are seeing increases of cases again,” Mullen said.“And we’re probably underreporting levels. A lot of countries are reducing their surveillance measures,” she added. “We are expecting that there will be some people traveling to the Games – whether it’s spectators or just to go visit Paris – that may not know they have COVID and be sick, and of course, spread it on to others.”The French capital is expected to welcome about 15 million tourists while it hosts the Olympic Games.Separate public health guidance for travelers attending the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games was released last week by WHO, the French Ministry of Health and Prevention, Santé publique France and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The guidance recommends checking your vaccination status against common infectious diseases including measles, whooping cough, polio and COVID-19.“Cases of measles are on the rise worldwide, including in Europe and in France,” the guidance notes. “Attending a mass gathering event increases your chances of being exposed to respiratory diseases, including whooping cough and COVID-19. If you have symptoms, such as a cough, fever or sore throat, stay at home or in your hotel if possible and consider wearing a mask when you leave your hotel or home.”",

    "text": "- India [International](https://indianexpress.com/international/) My papa, my amazing father, left us on June 1, 2011, for his heavenly abode. Papa fought a brave fight with NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which taught all of us who knew him, loved him, admired and adored him the futility of playing by rules, living a life of a disciplined human and doing as the doctor suggested. That his count of breaths in the human form where he was father to us three siblings and husband to my mother were over so soon, and that he was taken away sooner than one who had lived as conscientiously as he had, with such generosity of self, caring and sharing with stranger, friend and relative alike – was irksome beyond measure. But I find [myself](https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/what-money-cant-buy-suvir-saran-9335989/) shocked all these years later to find myself even closer to him now than I was when he lived. His soulful actions, his graceful gestures, his remarkably brilliant mind, his thoughtful magnanimity and intuitive affection and responsive thoughtfulness are even more alive today through a connection with my siblings and me and in the strength shown by my widowed mother in the calm and ease she puts into practice in the journey of her life. Mom and Dad had been together over 50 years when he passed. Five rich decades that gave them much to be proud of, to reflect upon and learn from, and to use as fuel for better outcomes in trying times when their humanity would be challenged and questioned, rattled and shaken. They met as teens and had a love marriage in 1967 in India where such nuptials were very uncommon. He became a part of Mum’s family, so much so that her siblings, who had addressed him by his name till that moment, started calling him Bhaisahab, a respected elder brother. In the relationship between my father and my mum’s siblings, I saw the fruits of an investment that turns outsiders into family. Papa could talk both sides of a question and, in doing so, give comfort and frustration, hope and questioning, love and hunger to those he spoke with and those watching the exchange. I remember well Papa’s bestie, Ajay Kumar, a man who visited our home daily with Aunty Abha, his wife, and my other mother. After their habitual morning walk, they would visit, and no morning would end without robust arguments about the politics of the nation, social values, and topics that touched on their combined morals. Papa would go against his own beliefs to heat up the mood and make Uncle argue his side to give us kids a lesson in history and politics and on debating and conversing. A dozen-plus years after Papa’s passing and a few short years after we lost Aunty and Uncle Kumar to Covid within days of each other, I find myself in Papa and Uncle’s awe for having given us kids the best tutelage on life and living, on understanding the pulse of the nation, on scratching deeply beneath the surface, and never settling for mediocrity and comfortable answers. Papa was the tough one, I thought, but in hindsight, I realise it was Mom who was tough. When I outed myself to them as being gay, Mom was the one with the questions that scratched beneath the surface. Papa would remain calm and play composed. When Newsweek magazine reviewed the opening of my first restaurant in India, Veda, where I had partnered with my bestie Rohit Bal, and my New York partner of our restaurant Devi, Rakesh Agrawal, their feature on me shared with millions across the world that I was a gay man. The issue came out while I was in Delhi and staying at my parents’ home. It hit the stands on Monday morning, and I made sure I didn’t come home till late into the night. I thought Papa would be asleep, but he called for me when he heard me arrive. He was recovering from a dangerous stay at the hospital where we had almost lost him, and this was his first night at home, miraculously so. When I arrived at his bedside, he reached for my hand, and in his faint and exhausted voice told me that he was most proud of me. He said he was thrilled that in outing myself I had given millions of kids my skin colour and other shades of brown and black a role model the world celebrated and held with respect and admiration. He went further and said I had provided for them what I never had: a person to connect with, to aspire to and fashion myself after; and with moist eyes, he kissed my hands. My trip home from New York to Delhi had been one of fear about how Mom and Dad would take Newsweek using my sexuality as a small step in normalising homosexuality for a young nation, albeit an old civilisation. Papa’s reaction, which I know had been articulated after meaningful and deep discussion with my mother, his beloved wife and best friend, was the affection that a smart man comes to after deliberation and thoughtful introspection. This same collegiality of [thought](https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/need-to-guard-plurality-ram-mandir-ayodhya-suvir-saran-9127957/) and action that he worked on with my mum made him accept my choosing art school over my other love, medicine, which was more in sync with his own gut. When Papa passed, my sister Seema reminded us that we had lost him in the physical form but that he was living and ticking in our shared DNA. This knowledge has been the greatest eye-opener and gift that Papa gave us in his passing. Our hopelessness at his death, our pain and suffering because of the finality of this loss – it was bigger than anything we had prepared ourselves for and came with no salve or solution. Luckily, I now find my Papa with me every breath that I breathe. He never leaves me. The realisation that he is in my blood, that he is part of me and I of him, has freed me of the suffering that comes from being consumed by the cycle of mortal life and death. In connecting with Papa at this level of familial union, I am never bereft of his company and counsel, of his support and love, his guidance and his questioning. I only have to go inside me, and both the questions and answers, the doubts and assurances, the direction and suggestions, all come to me with the same clarity of thought and action that symbolised Papa. June 1 was when we lost Papa to this world but was the day I found him connected to me in a holistic fashion, immortalised by our relationship and for eternity. Tears for his loss have turned into smiles that are my strength as I struggle with the challenges of life. Those smiles turn into gratitude for having had the blessing of being born to a man who devoted his life to his family, his wife and his kids, his friends, and to strangers he easily turned into supplicants and admirers because of his hungry brand of living, loving and caring.

    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WSYX) — A father pleaded not guilty today to child abuse charges involving his seven children. Jason Fuller was in court to answer to a 13-count indictment. Fuller is charged with eight counts of child endangering and one count of intimidating an attorney, victim or witness. His wife, Kristelle Fuller, was arraigned Wednesday. She's accused of abusing her children by using a belt on them, locking them in a shed, feeding them dog food, physically restraining them and more. Prosecutors said the incidents allegedly occurred between October 2015 and February 2024. Court documents spelled out a pattern of abuse. Prosecutors also said punishments included extreme physical exercise, to the point where one child passed out, and that the Fullers instructed their kids to lie to authorities about the abuse in order to protect them. The couple was arrested at their home last week after after a complaint was filed with [Job and Family Services](https://jfs.ohio.gov/). Kristelle Fuller's [bail was set](https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/kristelle-dawn-fuller-delaware-county-mother-mom-shed-dog-food-7-kids-children-abuse-jason-columbus-ohio#) at $75,000 dollars, and Jason Fuller's bail was set at $200,000. Both are under a no-contact order for any witnesses, victims or each other. The couple will be back in court on Friday, May 31.",

    "text": "Rare wetland birds with spoon-shaped beaks - once driven to extinction in the UK - have made a comeback with a new nesting site in the country's largest floodplain.Bird lovers say it is \"tremendously exciting\" to see Spoonbills thriving again, with successful breeding sites in Norfolk, Suffolk and now Cambridgeshire.The wading birds catch small fish, shrimps and small invertebrates by sweeping their spoon-shaped bill from side to side in shallow water.For the first time since the 17th century, Spoonbills have been seen nesting in Cambridgeshire's Ouse Washes, the UK’s largest 'washland' – areas adjacent to rivers which are flooded when water levels are high.The white birds were a familiar sight in the 16th century, but the draining of the Fens and hunting drove them to extinction. They did not breed successfully in the UK for 300 years.It was not until 2010 that the first regular colony made itself at home at Holkham nature reserve in Norfolk, the RSPB said.The conservation charity, which has been restoring wetland habitat, said the birds are now breeding at multiple RSPB reserves - including Havergate Island in Suffolk.Jonathan Taylor, site manager at RSPB Ouse Washes, said: “The Ouse Washes are the perfect habitat for spoonbills and we are delighted to have these birds breeding for first time.“Although they are breeding later here compared with other spoonbills in the UK, as is often the case with new colonies, it is fantastic that this iconic and highly adapted heron species has returned and is using our wetlands once again.”At Havergate Island, work to encourage nesting began in the mid-2000s and breeding started in 2019. The site is home to the only ground-nesting colony of the birds in the UK, with 17 pairs.Aaron Howe, south Suffolk sites manager for the RSPB, said: “We have undertaken lots of work over the years to create a haven for spoonbills, such as making the nesting island secure with fencing and ensuring there is ample suitable feeding in the estuary.“It’s fantastic to see them nest here and we’re expecting another successful year with more than 30 chicks ready to fledge.”Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?
