    "title": "Ultra-processed foods and health risks",
    "text": "Ultra-processed foods. It’s not a term many of us heard 10, or even five, years ago. But that’s starting to change. We now see it in news stories and posts on social media. And there’s good reason for that.\nEven as more ultra-processed foods fill grocery store shelves, we’re also learning more about their possible health risks.\nSo, what are these foods exactly? While a precise definition can vary a bit depending on who’s talking about them, there are a few simple ways to identify many ultra-processed foods.\n“Put simply, if you don’t see a food’s main ingredients in their natural forms — like grain, vegetables and meat, it is highly likely to be an ultra-processed food,” said Yikyung Park, professor in the Division of Public Health Sciences at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “Ultra-processed foods are highly manipulated and contain many added ingredients and additives. In most cases, we cannot make ultra-processed foods at home.”\nExamples include: soda (sugary and diet), lunch meat, instant noodles, instant soup, sausage, hot dogs, frozen meals (including pizza and burritos), many store-bought cakes and sweets, and even most breakfast cereals.\nEating higher amounts of ultra-processed foods is associated with a higher risk of several serious conditions, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, poor sleep, poor mental health — including anxiety and depression — and premature death, Park continued.\nHow ultra-processed foods increase these risks likely relates to their collection of ingredients. They tend to be high in those ingredients we should limit in a healthy diet and low in those we should focus on.\nThey can be high in calories, salt, unhealthy fats and added sugar and sweeteners, which can cause long-term inflammation in the body, disrupt the normal function of our metabolism and impact the development and release of neurotransmitters that play roles in mood disorders, such as depression, Park said.\nUltra-processed foods also tend to be very low in fiber, another potential negative. Higher fiber diets help promote a healthy microbiome, which is the collection of bacteria and other microorganisms in our gut that helps keep many processes in the body working normally, Park said. Eating lower-fiber, ultra-processed foods can have the opposite effect.\nSwitching from pre-packaged or fast foods to less-processed choices is one easy way to cut back on ultra-processed foods. Instead of frozen French fries or chips, choose a bag of nuts or buy raw popcorn and pop it in a pan at home. Instead of a frozen bean burrito, buy some tortillas, beans and cheese and make your own. In place of breakfast cereals, which can have refined, processed grains and many other ingredients, choose oatmeal, which is a simple whole grain.\nThese switches may take some extra effort at first, but it gets easier the more we do it, and often we can find that the less-processed options taste just as good — maybe even better — than the more processed foods.\nStart with a small goal of cutting back on a couple of ultra-processed foods. Then, build from there. Small changes have real health benefits and can also lead to bigger changes and improvements down the road.\nWhether we’re new to cutting back on ultra-processed foods or have been doing it for a while, Park shared one quick way to identify the types of foods we should try to steer clear of to improve our overall health. And all it takes is a glance at the food label.\n“If the ingredient list is very long and you don’t recognize those ingredients, it’s better not to eat that food,” Park concluded.\nDr. Graham A. Colditz, associate director of prevention and control at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is an internationally recognized leader in cancer prevention and the creator of the 8ightWays® to Prevent Cancer series.",

Anyone experiencing symptoms, such as high fever, cough, red rash, red, watery eyes, is advised to contact their health care provider and stay home from work or school.\nOntario's Ministry of Health says over 90 cases of measles have been confirmed in southwestern Ontario since January. Many of those cases have been found in children, and almost all have involved people who are not unvaccinated.\nThe ministry is asking some health units in the province to accelerate and expand administering measles vaccines.\nPPH is advising people in Peel Region to make sure their measles vaccinations are up to date, especially as March Break approaches and many people plan to travel. All Ontarians over six months old are eligible for vaccination against measles if travelling, PPH says.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease, PPH warns, and poses an increased risk of health complications to infants under the age of one, as well as unimmunized pregnant people and people with weakened immune systems.",

    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ (FOLHAPRESS) – Depois de um forte calor ao longo do dia nesta quinta-feira (21), a previsão é que a chegada de uma frente fria provoque uma chuva forte já durante a noite em todo estado do Rio de Janeiro.\nA dimensão que a chuva pode tomar até o fim de semana fez com que os municípios fluminenses antecedam medidas de atendimento à população.\nO prefeito Eduardo Paes (PSD) usou sua conta no X (antigo Twitter) para pedir que as pessoas se desloquem mais cedo nesta quinta-feira, e evitem de se deslocar pela cidade na sexta-feira.\nAo lado da chefe de meteorologia do Centro de Operações Rio, Raquel Franco, Paes pediu para as pessoas que moram em áreas de risco tomem cuidado e respeitem a sirene, respeita. “Parece que teremos um evento severo”, afirmou.\nOs números indicam que, da noite de quinta a domingo (24), pode chover de 300 a 500 milímetros por dia. O volume é maior do que o da média prevista para março inteiro na capital (135mm); ou quase o esperado para todo este mês em Petrópolis (207,5mm), na região serrana.\nO Cemaden (Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alerta de Desastres Naturais), alertou que o maior risco dessa vez está nas regiões metropolitana, serrana e no litoral sul do estado.\nA situação motivou uma reunião, nesta quarta (21), de representantes do Cemaden com as Defesas Civis fluminenses, para deixar a população de sobreaviso. O órgão nacional emitiu aviso de “grande perigo” para todo o estado, por causa da previsão de grandes volumes de chuva e ventos fortes.\nO Climatempo também emitiu alerta de que essa será uma situação “excepcional” e que os níveis pluviométricos entre esta quinta e domingo “podem superar o volume médio para todo o mês de março em 24/48 horas”.\nEm relação a temperatura, a previsão é de que os termômetros marquem entre os 18°C e os 29°C na sexta, e entre os 17°C e os 26°C no sábado. No domingo, a mínima deve ser de 17°C e máxima de 27°C.\nNesta quinta, o Greenpeace Brasil protocolou um ofício, com outras 34 organizações, cobrando medidas emergenciais do governo do estado antes que uma tragédia ocorra. Entre as recomendações, a organização destaca a suspensão de aulas e gratuidade no transporte viário para auxiliar no deslocamento da população.\n“É um pedido de socorro das nossas favelas, bairros e cidades do Rio de Janeiro, que se movimentam em busca de soluções diante da previsão de tempo para o final de semana”, disse a coordenadora da Casa Fluminense, Larissa Amorim, que está entre as organizações que assinam o documento.\nO governador Cláudio Castro (PL) reunirá ainda nesta quinta com representantes de órgãos sobre o tema para alinhas as ações do plano de contingência para reduzir os impactos da possível tempestade.\nNa capital, o Plano Verão foi acionada com horários estendidos das equipes, caso seja necessário. As medidas do programa também incluem um trabalho preventivo, como o de desassoreamento de rios, obras contra deslizamentos de encostas, e limpeza de ralos.\nNa Baixada Fluminense, que ficou debaixo dágua durante os temporais de janeiro e fevereiro, a cidade de Duque de Caxias informou que mobilizou todo seu efetivo para atuar em caso de necessidade. Já a Prefeitura de Nova Iguaçu disse que seguirá um plano de contingência em caso de eventos climáticos extremos e que poderá abrir pontos de atendimento e abrigos temporários.\nEm Niterói, na Região Metropolitana do Rio, a Defesa Civil está com toda a sua equipe de prontidão e conta ainda com mais de três mil voluntários para atuar em caso de chuvas fortes. Outros dois mil agentes também poderão ser mobilizados para atuar em casos de emergência.\nNa região serrana, o distrito de Petrópolis, que teve mais de 200 mortos na tragédia climática de janeiro de 2022, emitiu um aviso meteorológico, que dura até a tarde de segunda-feira por causa da chuva. A Defesa Civil do município disse que segue monitorando o tempo, podendo emitir novos alertas a qualquer momento.\nO prefeito Rubens Bomtempo também convocou o Comitê de Ações Emergenciais e instalou o Centro Integrado de Comando e Controle.\nEm Teresópolis, a Defesa Civil afirmou que as equipes estão “de sobreaviso e preparadas para o atendimento em caso de emergência”. A prefeitura entregou nesta quarta um muro de contenção construído no bairro do Caleme, atingido nas chuvas de 2011.\nJá a prefeitura de Friburgo informou que foram realizados simulados e que inaugurou obras de drenagem nos bairros de Olaria e do Centro. Com 36 sirenes instaladas, o município disse que conta ainda com novos computadores na sala de monitoramento e viaturas 4×4 adquiridas para atender ocorrências em terrenos adversos.\nEm todo estado, o Corpo de Bombeiros do Rio informou que irá dobrar o afetivo de militares de serviço “nas áreas onde há maior probabilidade de inundações, alagamentos, deslizamentos e desabamentos”, como na Baixada Fluminense, além das regiões serrana, sul, norte e noroeste fluminense. Nesses locais, segundo a corporação, os comandantes ficarão aquartelados e de prontidão, junto com a tropa.\n“Estamos a postos, preparados para agir com força total, caso o cenário de risco se confirme. Todos os recursos do Corpo de Bombeiros estão à disposição da população fluminense”, disse o coronel Leandro Monteiro.\nA Marinha do Brasil emitiu um aviso de ressaca, das 15h de sexta-feira até a madrugada de domingo, com ondas que podem chegar aos 3 metros de altura.",

    "text": "State Reps. Guzzardi, Cassidy got it right by calling for a cease-fire in Gaza The Netanyahu government’s aggressive military policy has endangered Israeli hostages and destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands who were living in Gaza, a reader in Logan Square writes. As a Jewish Chicagoan and a constituent of state Rep. Will Guzzardi, I thank him and state Rep. Kelly Cassidy for their brave and thoughtful explanation of why they signed a letter to President Joe Biden calling for a cease-fire in Gaza (“We’re Jewish legislators, calling for a cease-fire in Gaza” — Jan. 11). By acknowledging both their personal concern for Jewish friends and relatives in Israel and their horror at the nearly 25,000 Palestinian people killed in recent Israeli military action in Gaza, Cassidy and Guzzardi help us to see that concern for the safety of Jewish people cannot be meaningfully expressed as a singular focus on the welfare of Jews. They note the Netanyahu government’s aggressive military policy has endangered Israeli hostages. It also has maimed, widowed, displaced and destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of human beings who were living in Gaza. How can any of us be well amid such violence? I thank them for reminding us the most immediate need for everyone living in Israel and Palestinian territory is to stop the brutality, demand a cease-fire in which both parties put down weapons, distribute humanitarian aid, and return home every hostage and political prisoner. I hope President Biden heeds the letter. To do this with any credibility, he also must cease the U.S. financing of the Israeli military. Shari Stone-Mediatore, Logan Square Consumers, ditch natural gas and help the planet In “Illinois Commerce Commission steps up for natural gas customers” last month, the Sun-Times Editorial Board rightly celebrated the Illinois Commerce Commission for denying local gas utilities a requested rate hike that would have disproportionately hurt lower-income residents and recommitted everyone to a costly long-term investment in yesterday’s energy source. The atmospheric emissions of methane from the production, storage, transportation and combustion of natural gas fuels global climate change even more powerfully than carbon dioxide. The gas industry would have us believe its product is part of the “solution” to climate change, but it’s only fueling it. And we can’t wait for a gradual transition: 2023 was the hottest year on record, and extreme weather events have become commonplace. As recently [reported](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/8/24030075/great-lakes-warm-winter-ice-coverage-climate-change) in the Sun-Times, Lake Michigan was almost ice-free — in early January. Climate change is not a future problem. Consumers can do their part to ditch gas and its toxic methane emissions. If you have a clothes dryer, hot water heater, stove or furnace due for replacement, switch to an electric appliance, such as an induction stove or a heat pump dryer, water heater or HVAC system. Your home’s indoor air will be more healthful, and these more-efficient appliances cost less to run. More benefits? Heat pump HVAC systems heat and cool more evenly for greater comfort. Restaurant chefs are sharing their love for induction cooking because it’s ultra-fast, allows precision control and keeps commercial kitchens cooler. And while the upfront costs of electric appliances may be somewhat higher (for now), rebates and federal tax credits will help: Check them out at [energystar.gov/rebate-finder](http://energystar.gov/rebate-finder). The benefits to the environment? Priceless. Wendy Greenhouse, Oak Park Transfer Joliet Training Area to Midewin Thirty-one years ago, I served on the 24-member Joliet Arsenal Citizens Planning Committee formed by then-U.S. Rep. George Sangmeister to determine the future uses of the 23,000-acre former Army munitions plant. Out of this planning process came the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, two industrial zones, a county landfill and the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie. During the planning process, the committee foresaw the adjacent Joliet Army Training Area would itself someday be declared surplus due to development pressures all around it. The Joliet Training Area was part of the arsenal’s original footprint, as was the 170-acre Cantigny Woods, previously owned by the Forest Preserve of Will County, and they share a two-mile boundary. The connection was clear. To ensure the approximate 3,000-acre area be kept as open space, and not wanting to go through another protracted planning process, the committee unanimously approved the plan with the Joliet Army Training Area as a future addition to Midewin. Shepherded through Congress by then-U.S. Rep. Jerry Weller, the plan was codified into law by the Illinois Land Conservation Act of 1995. The committee’s foresight has proven to be spot-on because 29 years later, the area is now flanked by over 11,000 acres of intermodal facilities and over 1,000 new homes.dic It’s important to transfer the Joliet Training Area to Midewin because the land is home to globally rare examples of dolomite prairie, rare species, sedge meadows, the Millsdale Seeps, Jackson Creek, Jackson Creek Woods, Cantigny Woods and access to over a mile of the Des Plaines River shoreline. Moreover, it represents the work of dedicated citizens, bipartisan agreement among elected officials and the statewide support of conservation and veteran’s organizations that worked to pass the Midewin legislation. With increasing development pressure reducing the buffer around the Joliet Training Area, the Army may see it as more valuable as a real estate asset than a training area. Without congressional intervention, the Army may make incremental and irrevocable decisions that will jeopardize the commitment of the Forest Service to accept the land and thus diminish its future use. The current Illinois delegation and Gov. J.B. Pritzker should fulfill the vision that created America’s first National Tallgrass Prairie. Francis M.
