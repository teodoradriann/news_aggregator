    "title": "Britain's Cameron, in Kyiv, promises Ukraine aid for 'as long as it takes'",
    "text": "British Foreign Secretary David Cameron promised three billion pounds ($3.74 billion) of annual military aid for Ukraine for \"as long as it takes\" on Thursday, adding that London had no objection to the weapons being used inside Russia. \"We will give three billion pounds every year for as long as is necessary. We've just really emptied all we can in terms of giving equipment,\" he told Reuters in an interview on a visit to in Kyiv, adding that the aid package was the largest from the UK so far. \"Some of that (equipment) is actually arriving in Ukraine today, while I'm here,\" he said. Cameron said Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by London to strike targets inside Russia, and that it was up to Kyiv whether to do so. \"Ukraine has that right. Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,\" Cameron told Reuters outside St. Michael's Cathedral. Cameron, who led the UK from 2010 and 2016 as prime minister and only returned to frontline politics several months ago, met Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on his second visit to Kyiv as foreign secretary. Britain's top diplomat celebrated the release of a long-delayed $60 billion aid package by the U.S. Congress. \"It's absolutely crucial, not just in terms of the weapons it will bring, but also the boost to morale that it will bring to people here in Ukraine.\" However, Cameron did not answer directly when asked how he thought the possible re-election of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump to the White House could affect U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump and hardline Republicans in Congress oppose further aid to Ukraine, with the possible exception of a loan. \"It's not for us to decide who the Americans choose as their president - we will work with whoever that is,\" Cameron said, adding that the strategy for Ukraine's allies ought to be to ensure Ukraine is on the front foot by the time of the U.S. elections in November.

    "text": "Status: 29.12.2023, 08:30 a.m.\nBy: Sandra Barbara Furtner\nCommentsPrint Share\nThey are noisy and extremely alert: geese. To prevent prisoners from escaping, the chattering birds patrol along the fence.\nUsually, dogs such as German Shepherds or Malinois are used to protect state institutions. However, in São Pedro de Alcântara, a municipality in Brazil, geese take care of the approximately 1,300 inmates of a correctional facility. The attentive birds patrol along a green strip that lies between a fence and the prison wall. At the slightest movement, they get started.\nCheaper than dogs Geese are considered to be very intelligent \"guard dogs\" and protect their territory from predators. © biky/Imago\nAs the news program Zeit im Bild reports, geese are excellent guard animals. Chattering loudly and with wide-spread wings, the intelligent animals report every unusual movement. And according to the prison director, they are also much cheaper to keep than dogs.\nAccording to a report by Waz-online , geese are not unusual as guardians of the house and yard. The brave fowl is said to have successfully protected the Capitol in Rome as early as 386 BC. In Italy, too, geese are supposedly used on campsites to protect against burglars and theft.\nYou can find even more exciting animal topics in Landtiere.de's free partner newsletter, which you can subscribe to right here.\nThis makes it all the more clever to use geese in a prison as an additional living alarm system. According to local media, the herd consists of around 16 animals. To make them feel comfortable, a small pond is available for them.\nInstagram users joke with amusement: \"They make the prison goose safe\". \"I wouldn't mess with geese either.\" \"Brazil has been paying attention in Latin lessons\". \"One of them wanted to attack me on the Danube. Have respect for them.\" \"Learned from Medias In Res\". \"Goose good idea\".",

    "title": "Ahead of Easter rush, officials say drought must not put off Barcelona tourists",
    "text": "BARCELONA (Reuters): Tourists arriving at Barcelona’s airport or gazing at its iconic Sagrada Familia basilica will this Easter holiday be met with large signs in English that read: “Drought alert. During your stay, save water”.\nAs the impact of climate change intensifies across southern Europe, Spain’s Mediterranean region of Catalonia, which includes Barcelona, is enduring its worst drought on record.\nReservoir levels are only around 15% of their capacity, prompting curbs on water use by residents, visitors, agriculture and industry. Beach showers are shut and swimming pools cannot be filled with tap water, among other restrictions.\nCatalan officials have appealed for tourists to act responsibly, but are also adamant the drought should not put them off coming to the Spanish city and region most-visited by foreigners, where tourism accounts for 14.5% of the local economy.\n“The message from Catalonia’s tourism agency and business department to campsites and hotels is one of calm: (People) can enjoy their holidays here as usual,” said David Mascort, the regional government’s environmental chief.\nBarcelona’s hotel association warned in February the city could not afford to project an image abroad of hotels with empty pools. Hotels’ lobbying prompted the authorities to relax a total ban on filling pools, allowing desalinated water to be used instead.\n“Tourists are not scared by the drought and are not aware of it (before arriving),” said the hotel association director Manel Casals. “If we are not careful the image of Barcelona will be impacted (by the drought restrictions) but we are not aware of any negative impact so far. Tourists are still coming.”\nTourists visiting Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia confirmed they had known nothing of the water restrictions before seeing the billboards.\n“Of course, tourists can expend less water if they are aware of the situation,” Finnish traveller Johan Saltin said.\nBarcelona’s hotels have halved their water use since 2016, according to a recent hotel association study, though five-star hotels still using the most – 242 litres of water per day on average in 2022 – and all hotels represent 9% of the city’s consumption. Current water restrictions order residents to use only 200 litres per day.\nTourism over-saturation is already prompting protests by some Barcelona residents, and the drought may exacerbate the issue.\nHolding signs that read “Let’s close the faucet to tourism” and “Rivers and aquifers without water, hotels’ pools full”, environmental activists held a protest on Wednesday at Barcelona’s tourism agency, demanding restrictions for the sector.\n“With the situation we are living, it is indecent that the concern is to (avoid) sending an image of alarm to tourists when the real problem we have is that our territory is drying up,” said protester Josep Sabate.",

    "text": "Host cites spend years of resources and billions of dollars to create state-of-the-art facilities for the Olympics. But after the Closing Ceremony, often those venues are left abandoned to decay. Nearly a quarter of a century later, Sydney Olympic Park continues to host major events, but other cities didn’t utilise their facilities as effectively post-Games. BERLIN 1936 Abandoned houses for athletes marked with their housing complex names stand at the site of the former Olympic Village in Elstal, Germany. Built for the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the village later served as an infantry school for the Nazi-era Wehrmacht and a military hospital during World War II. After the war the Soviet Army took it over as a military base and training facility for Olympic athletes. Located just west of Berlin, the site has finally become interesting to investors due to the rapid rise in value of the Berlin real estate market over the last decade SARAJEVO 1984 Four decades after Bosnia's capital Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics, residents remember the event with a mixture of pride and melancholy because it marked one of the last unifying moments in Yugoslavia before war destroyed the country. Most of the Olympics infrastructure was destroyed during the war that raged from 1992 to 1995. The stunning reversal of the city's fortunes remains a bittersweet wound for residents with living memories of both the Olympics and the war that followed. ATHENS 2004 Images of the abandoned 2004 Olympics beach volleyball centre are jarring. The building interior is heavily graffitied, strewn with garbage and stripped of anything not bolted down. One corridor is ankle deep in mouldy documents. A tree has sprouted at the front door. A homeless man shuffles in the back. “It’s no secret that Greece had spent a lot of money in building state-of-the-art facilities. But then after the construction, there was no budget,” Spyros Capralos, head of the Hellenic Olympic Committee, explained to AFP. RIO 2016 The Olympic Aquatics Stadium in Rio de Janeiro lies abandoned, with very few events organised in the years since. The Rio pool was dismantled after the Games, but the building remains a facility in decay. The Aquatics Stadium was meant to be dismantled, but progress has been slow. Numerous areas of standing water can be found inside and outside the venue, making them dengue and zika risk areas.",

    "text": "Vietnam veteran reunited with dog tag he lost nearly 60 years ago LAKE CITY, S.C. (WPDE) - A Vietnam veteran from South Carolina has been reunited with his dog tag that he lost decades ago, thanks to a treasure hunter and the power of social media. Larry Morganti is still stunned the dog tag he lost in a rocket attack nearly 60 years ago is back in his possession. He was the crew chief on a C-123 cargo plane during the Vietnam War as part of the 311th Squadron of the Air Force from October 1967 to October 1968. Morganti recalled that while serving, he once heard a loud bomb and began running for his life. Somewhere in the chaos, he lost his dog tags and later went to his first sergeant for a new pair, thinking little of it. It hadn’t really crossed his mind where the originals might be until a Swedish construction worker named Kristoffer Hansen made contact with him. Hansen saw Morganti’s artwork on a Facebook post for The Vault, a shop that holds works by an array of vendors, and realized he’d been searching for the man for two years. He reached out to store manager Debrah Lane for help contacting Morganti. Hansen said he found one of the veteran’s dog tags with a metal detector. At first, Lane was skeptical of the claim, wary of scammers and hackers, but she says she knew it was real when Hansen provided Morganti’s personal information, such as when and where he served. “I thought, ‘What a wonderful moment that this guy felt the need to return these tags to their original owner’ and the fact that he cared enough to do it,” Lane said. “And the fact that Mr. Larry is still alive is fabulous to me. I just thought that it was the best story that we, as Americans, can hear today.” During an art event where Morganti was being honored, Lane shared the incredible news about his dog tag, bringing chills and tears of joy to all. Morganti himself says he’s still in shock. “It was real surprising. In fact, for a second, I didn’t believe it. It’s such a far-fetched idea to find tags 56 years old and then another two years to bring them to me. He searched, I’m sure, long and hard to find them,” Morganti said. Lane says it was a gift from God that she was able to bridge that gap and make this phenomenal connection. Hansen sent the dog tag to Morganti, along with a letter thanking him for his service, in late April. Copyright 2024 WPDE via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Estephan veut garder Mbilli à Québec\nAppel d'offres de l'IBF\nCamille Estephan n’en démord pas, il faut que son boxeur Christian Mbilli dispute son prochain combat au Centre Vidéotron de Québec.\n• À lire aussi: Estephan face à un dilemme cornélien\nLe président d’Eye of the Tiger Management (EOTTM) espérait s’entendre avec le promoteur du boxeur français Kevin Lele Sadjo (24-0, 21 K.-O.), mais il n’y a pas eu d’entente pour ce combat face à Mbilli (28-0, 23 K.-O.) et l’International Boxing Federation (IBF) a lancé un appel d’offres dont le gagnant sera connu le 30 janvier.\nLe promoteur Yohan Zaoui a tenté de convaincre Estephan de franchir l’Atlantique, mais il n’a pas été en mesure de le convaincre.\nJe veux le faire à Québec, mais il a essayé de me dire que c’est deux Français invaincus en me disant qu’il faut considérer la France. Au début, il a fait miroiter Canal+ comme partenaire et ç’a achoppé. Il a parlé d’une billetterie de 15 000 billets, il parait qu’il y a beaucoup de billets donnés à Paris et tout d’un coup, tu veux leur vendre des billets, c’est difficile», a confié Estephan jeudi en marge d’une conférence de presse pour annoncer le gala qui va mettre en vedette Steven Butler et Eric Bazinyan.\nRisque\nCamille Estephan se dit ouvert à toutes les offres, mais il place surtout l’avenir de Mbilli au centre de ses préoccupations et aller boxer dans l’Hexagone était un gros enjeu pour lui.\n«Je trouve que ça représente un grand risque pour Christian et c’est un risque que je ne veux pas prendre. Ce qui a vraiment pesé beaucoup dans la balance, c’est l’heure de grande écoute en Amérique du Nord. Il va être beaucoup plus sous les projecteurs pour un éventuel combat forcé contre Canelo Alvarez même si je ne prends pas Sadjo à la légère.»\nCamille Estephan n’a pas encore sorti le champagne, mais il croit qu’il sera choisi pour organiser le duel.\n«J’ai confiance de gagner l’appel d’offres et de pouvoir présenter le combat à Québec en avril. Je pense que le boxeur veut boxer contre Christian, peu importe la situation. Tu ne peux pas passer à côté d’une opportunité comme celle-là.»",
