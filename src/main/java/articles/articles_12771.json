    "title": "‘From lab to love’: Former research beagles play in Kelowna after rescue - Today in BC",
    "text": "Ten sweet pups have made their first steps towards a life outside of a laboratory, thanks to the Beagle Alliance. “These dogs have never felt the sun on their snouts or the grass under their paws. It’s a special moment to see their first few steps”, says Lori Cohen, executive director of The Beagle Alliance, an organization that works to help dogs that were used as animal test subjects in laboratories. The 10 pups came from an undisclosed lab in the United States and have been travelling across Canada since April 16, on the “dogs know no border tour.” The crew has been travelling from Manitoba to Vancouver Island, dropping off pups with their new foster and forever families along the way. Six of the former test subjects are already snuggled in and acclimatizing to a life of luxury. On April 18, the four remaining dogs got to stop for a play break in Kelowna while two of the rescued beagles met their new foster families. The last two pups will continue their journey to foster homes in Castlegar and Nanaimo. Forever homes are still being sought for the pups and people who are interested in adopting a dog are asked to contact the [Beagle Alliance](https://thebeaglealliance.org/) at 1(204)266-1968. While the rescue organization cannot disclose the name or type of lab the dogs were rescued from or what exactly the animals endured, it is evident that they have suffered trauma, said Cohen. She has assisted in the rescue of more than 50 beagles from animal testing and is a fur mom to two pups, including the first-ever Beagle Alliance rescue. “They do suffer in varying degrees with PTSD and anxiety,” said Cohen about the former research subjects. To help the beagles overcome the anxiety associated with entering a new phase of life and to learn to overcome their trauma, Cohen said the rescue tries to send the rescued pups to foster homes that already have friendly dogs. She said that having a puppy dog role model helps the rescued pups learn to play and act like a dog. “They never learned how to be a dog and do not even know how to play,” said Cohen. The use of animal testing for research is legal in Canada and the USA. Most commonly, dogs are used in veterinary medicine and cosmetic testing. Cohen said that beagles are the primary breed of dog used in research because they are friendly, do not typically bite, and most importantly are forgiving. Typically, after a life of being used as a test subject, the animals are euthanized once they are no longer of use to the lab. To give the animals an opportunity to experience life outside, the Beagle Alliance rescues the critters so that they can go “from lab to love.” Rescue organizations, like the Beagle Alliance, are only able to step in once the research animals are no longer of use to the laboratory and are deemed acceptable for release. The Beagle Alliance also rescues other breeds of dogs, cats and farm animals that were used in research or were in situations of abuse and neglect, across Canada and the midwest United States. The 10 beagles that were rescued by the Alliance are between the ages of four and seven and are ready to start exploring the world outside of a sterile laboratory.

    "title": "Vanessa Low sets T63 long jump world record in Paris | The Canberra Times | Canberra, ACT",
    "text": "Vanessa Low reckons motherhood is her superpower and with her young son Matteo watching from the stands of Stade de France she took flight.She set a new world record of 5.45m in the T63 long jump, on her first jump. She jumped the exact same distance with her fifth jump, and after she fouled her final jump she rushed to the fence where her husband and coach Scott Reardon and Matteo were waiting.Low and Reardon embraced, there were tears of joy, little Matteo was just taking it all in. He'll be too young to remember what his mother achieved in Paris but memories were made.It was Low's fourth Paralympics, she won gold for Germany in Rio before switching her allegiances to Australia where she defended her medal in Tokyo. She knew her competing days weren't over but she was keen to start a family. Matteo was born in 2022.Low and Reardon are based in Canberra. Reardon is considered one of Australia's greatest ever Paralympians, with a gold medal from Rio and a silver from Tokyo, and multiple world championship titles under his belt. He famously learned to walk again in a week and a half, after an accident on the family farm in Temora severed his right leg when he was 12.But on Friday morning, he was first and foremost a proud husband and father and coach.Lauren Parker wasn't going to let a stomach upset get in the way of her medal dreams. She added to her Paris collection by dominating the women's h1-4 cycling road race, finishing the 28.4km course in 52min 4sec, 4min 11sec ahead of reigning Paralympic champion Jennette Janson.She revealed she's been ill since Monday's triathlon where she swallowed some water during the swim leg in the Seine on her way to the gold medal.The water quality of the Seine has been a talking point since Paris was awarded both the Olympics and the Paralympics. In both Games, events have been delayed until organisers deemed it safe.But Parker put that all aside. In 2017, she was told she would never be an athlete again after she suffered a broken back, spinal-cord damage, a broken shoulder, four broken ribs, a punctured lung and a shattered pelvis when she crashed in training for the Ironman Australia triathlon. She called on all that resilience on the road race couse at Clichy-sous-Bois.She broke clear on the first climb after six kilometres and was a minute and a half ahead at the halfway mark.Torrential rain early in the day caused confusion as officials firstly delayed the start by an hour, then advised the race would be cut to one lap before finally confirming only minutes before the start that it would remain at two laps. With two gold and a silver in her luggage, Parker is now wondering what's next.No one was going to catch reigning world record holder Tim Hodge in the men's SM9 200m individual medley.He swam a strong opening butterfly leg and held the lead throughout, setting a new Paralympic record of 2min 13.31sec.It was his second gold medal in Paris, after the mixed 100m medley relay (34 points) gold on day five in Paris,Samuel von Einem continued Australia's great run in the table tennis, grabbing a bronze medal in the men's MS11 singles table tennis.He went down to Korea's Gi Tae Kim 11-5, 8-11, 11-9, 15-13 but both losing semi-finallists are awarded bronze medals. Australia's ninth on the medal tally at the end of Day 8. We've won 14 gold, 12 silver and 19 bronze for a total of 45 medals.China surges ahead with 74 gold, in their amazing total of 166. Great Britain, the USA, the Netherlands and France round out the top five.",

    "text": "HOPEWELL, Va. -- For the second year in a row, the city of Hopewell will utilize an old city-owned building to serve as an inclement weather shelter. \"It's a much-needed thing,\" said Beacon Hill Church Pastor Michael Moore. \"Huge plus, huge need, so thankful and we're happy to be a part of supporting them.\" The shelter is different from others in the area as it houses men and women in separate areas of the building at night. \"This is a safe place, where those individuals can come and get the services they need, which is a bed to sleep in, a warm meal and just a safe warm place,\" Director of Hopewell Department of Social Services Wanda Williams said. \"We don’t want our Citizens to be out in the elements during that time of the year, especially late at night when the temperatures drop.” The shelter is the only nighttime, winter shelter that is open in the Tri-Cities area. With rain and snow possible in the forecast, the shelter is already a safe haven that receives plenty of use. \"It's estimated it could be as many as 30, that do not have a place to lay their head at night, a warm stable place,\" Williams said. Even though not all without a home are willing to come to a shelter, they say there is enough room in the building to add more beds. \"To have this facility and have this space available for those who don’t have any alternatives, it makes me feel good,\" Williams said. \"I think what it says to the citizens of Hopewell, as well as across the Country, is that we are concerned about our Homeless Population and it is important to us, we ensure their safety.” The Hopewell Inclement Weather Shelter will run through March, from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. In the summer months, during intense heart, an alternate location will be open during the daytime hours.

    "text": "RAPID CITY, S.D. – One Heart Inc. is an organization focused on programs for those struggling with addiction, homelessness, and domestic abuse. One of their programs, The Towers at One Heart, provides transitional housing for those in need. However, The Towers are currently at capacity. We spoke with Charity Doyle, the CEO of One Heart, to get insight into the challenges The Towers are faced with. “We don't want to add trauma to people when they're already in a very difficult place in life by splitting people up,” said Doyle, “We worked really hard to make sure we found a property that could accommodate those needs and keep families together. Expanding it would be really, really difficult right now. We are, however, always keeping our eye on properties that come up for sale to keep the campus contiguous.” One Heart is currently focused on sustaining the services they already provide at The Towers such as 24-hour security, ensuring a safe environment for residents. While approximately 80% of the residents at The Towers suffer from substance abuse, upon leaving One Heart for bigger and better things, the rate of relapse is less than 30%. This is achieved in part to various programs adjacent to The Towers such as The Atrium, a program for supporting longevity and sobriety who those who have been freed from substance abuse issues. The Towers also provide services to students of the nearby South Dakota Mines. For Charity Doyle, a large part in developing the programs at One Heart involved her personal experience with homelessness while attending South Dakota Mines. She extends from her personal experience by providing housing for students in similar situations. To show support for The Towers and One Heart’s mission, head to oneheartrc.org",
