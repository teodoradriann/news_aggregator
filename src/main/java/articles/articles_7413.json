    "text": "UN Climate Change News, 05 July 2024 - As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events around the world, early warning systems (EWS) can save lives and livelihoods. The June UN Climate Meetings in Bonn brought together experts to discuss how innovative technologies can boost risk-informed adaptation and climate resilience. Technology plays a crucial role in enhancing risk knowledge, strengthening EWS, and informing climate development and investment policies, particularly in vulnerable regions. A side-event on technology, convened during the June Meetings by the UNFCCC Technology Executive Committee ( [TEC](https://unfccc.int/ttclear/tec)) and the UNEP Climate Technology Centre and Network ( [CTCN](https://www.ctc-n.org/)), focused on scaling up EWS globally and supporting the UN Secretary-General's [Early Warnings for All](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/early-warnings-for-all#:~:text=The%20%22Early%20Warnings%20for%20All,by%20the%20end%20of%202027.&text=If%20playback%20doesn%27t%20begin%20shortly%2C%20try%20restarting%20your%20device.,-More%20videos%20on) initiative, which aims to ensure that by 2027 every person on Earth is protected by EWS. Cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence, remote sensors and satellites can be used to analyse data, predict extreme weather events, and provide targeted alerts for communities at risk, among other things. EWS will be greatly boosted by artificial intelligence, says UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. \"AI can offer remarkably precise foresight on imminent climate impacts and disasters,\" he said at a [recent meeting on climate and AI](https://unu.edu/ehs/announcement/bonn-ai-climate-2024). \"This could be instrumental in helping countries and communities prepare - providing real time information that saves lives and livelihoods on a massive scale. As we fight for an equitable and just transition, we need to make sure that these technologies are accessible to all.\" During the technology side-event, UN Climate Change Senior Director Daniele Violetti emphasized that nearly 50 percent of countries have included early warning systems in their national climate plans (known as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs), and that one in four prioritize enhancing technology and innovation. Prioritizing people-centred solutions A policy brief on innovation for risk knowledge is being developed by TEC and the Group on Earth Observations ( [GEO](https://earthobservations.org/)) and will be launched later this year. TEC Chair Thibyan Ibrahim noted that the brief highlights the importance of context-specific technology and locally led, people-centred solutions. Location-based messaging, for example, can help communities receive targeted warnings directly on their phones, ensuring they have the information they need to protect people and livelihoods ahead of extreme weather events. Similarly, real-time monitoring can empower residents to take swift community action and build resilience. The Maldives - the first country to launch a roadmap for achieving Early Warnings for All - serves as a key example. Gaia Righini, from the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), noted how improved monitoring networks, supported by Italy, have strengthened the Maldives Meteorological Service since 2017. However, in vulnerable regions, deploying innovative technologies remains challenging. Lack of funding, insufficient technical expertise, and inadequate infrastructure can significantly hinder progress. Overcoming these barriers is crucial to achieving the UN Secretary-General's vision of Early Warnings for All. Fostering collaboration Anne Rasmussen, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), emphasized the challenges remote island communities face in accessing modern technology. She stressed the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with scientific data to improve EWS effectiveness, and the need for international cooperation to better prepare Small Island Developing States (SIDS) for climate-related disasters. A significant part of the side-event focused on the need to scale up technologies for climate information and early warnings in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), and to address global disparities accessing disaster risk data, especially in LDCs and SIDS. Insights from the discussions will feed into the joint policy brief under development by TEC and GEO. Ambrosio Yobanolo, co-lead of the TEC Activity Group on EWS, and Fred Onduri, CTCN Advisory Board Chair, concluded the event by stressing the need to stay abreast of the latest technologies, strengthen collaboration among stakeholders, and leverage EWS to create more resilient and climate-adaptive communities.

    "text": "Le président du Rassemblement national, Jordan Bardella, a assuré jeudi qu&#039;il ne laisserait pas &quot;l&#039;impérialisme russe absorber un État allié comme l&#039;Ukraine&quot; tout en répétant qu&#039;il refuserait l&#039;envoi de soldats français sur le sol ukrainien s&#039;il devenait Premier ministre à l&#039;issue des élections législatives. &quot;Ma position est très simple sur ce conflit (...) Elle n&#039;a jamais varié. C&#039;est celle d&#039;un soutien à l&#039;Ukraine et d&#039;éviter une escalade avec la Russie qui est, je le rappelle, une puissance nucléaire&quot;, a déclaré le leader d&#039;extrême droite lors du dernier débat télévisé avec le Premier ministre Gabriel Attal et le socialiste Olivier Faure. Interrogé sur les propos de Marine Le Pen qui a estimé la veille que le rôle de chef des armées pour le président de la République se réduit à un &quot;titre honorifique&quot;, Jordan Bardella, candidat pour Matignon si le RN obtient la majorité absolue à l&#039;issue des législatives , n&#039;a pas reculé. &quot;Prendre le pas sur les institutions&quot; &quot;C&#039;est le Premier ministre qui décide du budget de fonctionnement des armées&quot;, a-t-il martelé. Une position qu&#039;a vivement dénoncé Gabriel Attal: &quot;Derrière le &#039;titre honorifique&#039;, il y a l&#039;idée que le président de la République ne serait plus en mesure de prendre de décisions&quot;, s&#039;est-il alarmé. &quot;Si le Rassemblement national venait à gagner cette élection, il y aurait une forme de dispute entre le Premier ministre et le président de la République pour savoir à qui a le rôle de chef des armées&quot;, a-t-il ajouté. &quot;C&#039;est un message envoyé aux puissances mondiales, au monde entier, qui est un message très grave pour la sécurité des Français.&quot; &gt;&gt; LIRE AUSSI - Guerre en Ukraine : Zelensky compte sur le maintien du soutien de Paris après les élections françaises Pour Olivier Faure, les propos de Marine Le Pen montrent que l&#039;extrême droite cherche à &quot;prendre le pas sur les institutions&quot;. Jordan Bardella veut &quot;tout prendre&quot;, a-t-il accusé. Le président du RN s&#039;est aussi dit de nouveau opposé à l&#039;envoi de missiles longue portée qui pourraient frapper directement le territoire russe. Cela pourrait &quot;placer la France et les Français dans une situation de cobelligérance&quot;, a-t-il déclaré. Le premier secrétaire du parti socialiste s&#039;est dit, au contraire, &quot;favorable&quot; à l&#039;envoi de missiles s&#039;ils &quot;permettent de viser sur le sol russe des infrastructures qui servent à bombarder le sol ukrainien&quot;. De son côté, Gabriel Attal, qui mène la campagne pour le camp présidentiel, a répété qu&#039;il fallait soutenir les Ukrainiens à la fois &quot;parce qu&#039;ils défendent des valeurs qui sont les nôtres: la démocratie, la liberté&quot; et &quot;parce qu&#039;en les soutenant, on défend aussi les Français et leur quotidien&quot;.",

    "text": "Some of the most memorable parties this New Year’s Eve will be wedding celebrations.\nThe number of couples going to the chapel for New Year’s Eve weddings in Las Vegas could be significantly higher than normal this year, a Las Vegas Review-Journal article reports, due to the date’s repeat pattern of numbers, 1-2-3-1-2-3. (12/31/23.)\nClark County, Nevada — expecting an increased stream of travelers to Vegas to get married — opened a pop-up satellite office Tuesday for marriage licenses at Harry Reid International Airport.\nThe combination of the first three numbers in Dec. 31 (1-2-3) is considered good luck for couples pledging their love this Sunday. According to numerology, 123 represents harmony, connection, growth, co-existence, as well as self-reliance.\nThose promises have proven true for one Atlanta couple, Coy Dumas Jr. and Teresa Dumas, who have been married for decades. Their wedding ceremony began at 11:50 p.m. on New Year’s Eve 45 years ago. The couple said “I do” at midnight, Coy Dumas said.\n“We considered Valentine’s Day and June but thought everybody seems to do that,” Coy Dumas said. “We like to do things a little different from everybody.”\nTheirs was a quiet wedding celebration with a handful of family in attendance at the home of Coy Dumas’ mother back in 1978. But, nuptials and New Year’s Eve festivities can make for a perfect combination.\nExplore This is why we eat black-eyed peas on New Year’s Day\nCredit: Courtesy Lora Sommer\nCredit: Courtesy Lora Sommer\nDJ Topher Taylor, owner of Radial Entertainment in Atlanta, said there is an exuberance that takes place with ringing in the new year just before the wedding couple’s official departure.\n“It’s wonderful for couples to have weddings on New Year’s Eve,” Taylor said. “We try to maximize the celebration of the newlywed couple and excitement of New Year’s Eve. The wedding and New Year’s celebration can complement each other.”\nThis is the fourth consecutive year that Taylor will spin music for a wedding reception taking place on New Year’s Eve. Radial’s DJs spin records alongside a live band that’s performing simultaneously.\nDJ Victor Jones, a contractor for Radial and a former longtime DJ at Johnny’s Hideaway nightclub in Buckhead, is already booked for a wedding set for New Year’s Eve 2024, Taylor said.\nTaylor was hired for this Sunday’s wedding of Paige Wolkin and David Port.\nThe couple had previously attended New Year’s Eve weddings and the feel of the events was special, Wolkin said.\n“Just the energy surrounding the evening was double that of other weddings we had been to,” she said.\nThere are pluses and minuses to planning a wedding that takes place on the most popular night of the year.\nWolkin said that because some businesses close for the holidays, she picked up her wedding dress three weeks early.\nBooking venues and limousines could be an issue unless they are reserved far in advance, and travel costs could be high during the holiday season, says Shelly Danz, owner of Atlanta Wedding Connection.\n“If you want to have a wedding date of this significance, sending out a ‘save the date’ notice far in advance would be a priority,” Danz said.\nAtlanta Wedding Connection will host a wedding show of vendors offering live music, bridal gowns, floral arrangements, wedding cakes and other must-haves for weddings at the Georgia Aquarium on Jan. 28 .\n“There’s a lot of fun things that can be added to the wedding event,” she said of a New Year’s Eve ceremony.\nSpecialty cocktails, New Year’s Eve fireworks or inside sparklers that appear similar to fireworks, add to lasting memories of the wedding event. And despite some of the planning challenges that come with a New Year’s Eve wedding, a year-end ceremony can offer relief to guests who might otherwise not know how to spend the evening.\n“For your guests, some of them may see it as ‘Oh great I have a party to go to on that night. I don’t have to worry about what I’m doing,’” Danz said.\nRelated\nTikTok: Numerologists, lovebirds excited for 123-123 date\n4 tips for finding love in the new year About the Author\nAdrianne Murchison Adrianne Murchison covers local government in north Fulton County for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.",
