    "text": "More protests were staged on the streets of Nairobi on Thursday, a day after President William Ruto bowed to pressure mounted by Gen Z over the contentious Finance Bill, 2024. The protesters, unbowed, chanted “Ruto must go” as they changed course of protests, which had earlier targeted State House and engaged police in running battles for the better part of the day. The protests were driven by mobilisation through #OccupyParliament hashtag and #RejectFinanceBill2024 mainly on X and TikTok. Administration Police and General Service Unit in anti-riot gear shoot in the air and launched teargas canisters to disperse youth who engaged officers in running battles in the city. Initially, the protesters had vowed to march to State House but heavy security deterred their cause. Roads leading to State House were [completely cordoned off](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001497944/roads-to-state-house-blocked-security-heightened-ahead-of-protests) by police. There was little vehicular movements with most shops closed for the better part of the day. Public service transport was interrupted as vehicle owners grounded their vehicles For the entire part of the day, teargas rented the CBD air, as police battled the demonstrators, arresting many in the process. Downtown areas of Kirinyaga Road, River Road, Ronald Ngala Street remained battle zones the entire afternoon as police, both in uniform and plain-clothes chased demonstrators out of the CBD. Several protesters were shot and some injured in the downtown streets as media were denied entry to the areas. According to Kelvin Mwololo, secretary-general of Medics for Kenya, which had set a medical centre at Jamia Mosque area since demonstrations started, they received over 50 injury victims. “We have received people who have sustained injuries from live bullets, teargas canisters and rubber bullets and so far we gave received about 50 cases,” said Mwololo. Part of those attended to included journalists who got injured in the protests. But even as protestors engaged police in running battles, they argued that not assenting to the Bill by the President was not enough. In fact, they wanted the President to step down. After they occupied Parliament on Tuesday and the President withdrawing the Bill, the protestors were on Thursday on the streets for an expanded cause: ‘Ruto must go’. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter Some of the protestors who spoke to The Standard expressed their displeasure with how Ruto’s regime has handled their taxes. According to them, the President’s reluctance to address rampant graft in government institutions and the perceived misappropriation of public funds signalled incompetence by the Head of State. “They tell us the government cannot function without taxes. Yes, we are willing to pay, but why is the President reluctant to curb graft in the government?” asked Mary, one of the protesters. To others, high unemployment in the country pushed them to the streets to protest. “We are jobless, the government is unwilling to listen to us, and we will force them to respond. We are tired,” said Alice Githinji, a Nairobi resident participating in the demonstrations. Alice said she holds a bachelor’s degree in Computer science. As the course of protests [took a new twist](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001497954/developing-teargas-running-battles-as-more-protests-rock-parts-of-kenya), businessmen were counting losses for the second time this week. Most businesses including retail supermarkets, clothes and mobile phone shops, eateries and banks remained closed as police battled the deviant protesters most of the day. On Thursday, looters took advantage of demonstrations to cut metal barriers and break glass windows of shops and made away with goods worth millions of shillings. Naivas supermarket outlets along Ronald Ngala Street and on Development House suffered major looting by protesters, who broke metallic doors and emptied shelves. Quickmart supermarket located on Mfangano Street near Afya Centre was not spared either, so was Nairobi Veterinary Centre, Agricultural Development Corporation branch and ATM machines belonging to KCB and Absa Kenya banks located on Development House. Medallion restaurant near Development House on Moi Avenue was broken into and looted. Several shops on ground and first floors of RNG Plaza on Ronald Ngala Street were looted. “I have suffered a loss of more than Sh2 million worth of phones and CCTV equipment stock,” said Chrispus Mwanzi, a shop owner at RNG Plaza.",

    "text": "近期，上市券商一季度业绩轮廓逐渐明晰，密集披露的业绩预增公告揭示了多家公司归母净利润显著增长的态势，凸显出资本市场回暖背景下券商板块的业绩弹性。其中，综合实力雄厚的头部公司持续领跑，中小券商则展现出“弹性十足”的业绩表现。\n　　基于目前已披露的业绩预增情况，分析师普遍对上市券商一季度业绩持乐观态度，认为券商整体业绩有望超预期。开源证券非银金融行业首席研究员高超表示：“上市券商一季度业绩增速整体超预期，预计一季度交易量高增长、投资收益低基数是主要驱动力。”\n　　 业绩弹性足\n　　截至4月16日记者发稿，共有9家上市券商发布了一季度业绩预增公告，均预计净利润实现较大幅度增长。\n　　从头部券商来看，券商“新巨头”国泰海通预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润112.01亿元至124.45亿元，同比增长350%至400%。中信证券预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润约65.45亿元，同比增长32%左右。华泰证券预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润34.37亿元至36.66亿元，同比增长50%至60%。\n　　同时， 中国银河 （ 601881 ）预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润27.73亿元至31亿元，同比增长70%至90%。 中金公司 （ 601995 ）预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润为18.58亿元至21.06亿元，同比增长50%至70%。 中信建投 （ 601066 ）预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润约18.43亿元，同比增长50%左右。\n　　中小券商业绩表现则“弹性十足”。其中，东北证券预计一季度实现营业收入14.85亿元，较上年同期增长25.94%；实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润2.02亿元，较上年同期增长859.84%。 华安证券 （ 600909 ）预计一季度实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润为5.02亿元至5.58亿元，同比增长80%至100%。东吴证券预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润9.12亿元至10.03亿元，同比增长100%至120%。\n　　对于一季度上市券商业绩增长的原因，多家券商表示，主要得益于财富管理、投资交易等业务收入的增长。中信证券表示，一季度，公司锚定打造一流投资银行和投资机构的发展目标，积极服务实体经济，综合金融服务能力持续提升，财富管理、投资交易等业务收入同比增加较多。华泰证券表示，一季度，公司不断深化平台化、一体化与国际化运营，财富管理、机构服务、投资管理等主要业务线均同比显著增长。\n　　国泰海通业绩实现大幅增长的原因，除了上述提及的财富管理、投资业务向好之外，还涉及公司之间的吸收合并交易。国泰海通表示，一季度，公司主动把握市场机遇，全面推进零售、机构和企业三大客户服务体系建设，推进各项业务稳步发展，取得较好经营业绩。同时，公司积极推进换股吸收合并海通证券相关工作，加速向国际一流投资银行迈进。一季度，公司归属于母公司所有者的净利润增长的主要原因为吸收合并海通证券产生负商誉。\n　　“预计经纪与信用业务是上市券商一季度业绩增长的主要支撑，投资业务也同比改善。”国泰海通非银首席分析师刘欣琦预计，经纪及信用业务合计贡献增量收入的78.5%，是券商板块业绩增长的主要支撑。同时，预计投资业务同比有所改善。\n　　 经纪、信用业务成“增长引擎”\n　　回顾今年一季度市场走势，数据显示，一季度A股日均交易额1.52万亿元，同比增长70.27%。上交所数据显示，一季度A股新开户数量为747.14万户，同比增长32.75%。\n　　“一季度上市券商业绩的增长，一方面受去年同期自营业务低基数效应影响，另一方面得益于一季度股票成交量同比高增带动经纪业务收入增长。”中信建投非银及金融科技首席分析师赵然表示，4月份以来，券商板块经历短暂回调后，性价比再度凸显，看好板块后续估值修复动能，核心逻辑在于业绩韧性筑牢安全边际，政策与宏观环境改善形成双重催化，板块估值具备向上空间。\n　　针对上市券商一季度整体业绩，方正证券研究所所长助理、金融首席分析师许旖珊表示：“预计上市券商一季度主营收入同比增长33.1%，归母净利润同比增长77.7%；剔除国泰海通吸收合并的负商誉影响后，预计一季度券商板块归母净利润同比增长51%。分业务看，预计一季度经纪、信用业务为券商业绩增长的主要驱动力，经纪、投行、资管、净利息、净投资收入分别同比增长65.7%、27.8%、2.8%、77.1%、2.7%。”",

Reuters\nEuropa Rusia y Ucrania refuerzan la carrera armamentística: Kiev dobla su producción y Moscú la multiplica por 50 El Gobierno de Zelenski busca incrementar la fabricación propia de armas este 2024 para dejar de depender del suministro extranjero. 28 diciembre, 2023 22:10 guardar Guerra Rusia-Ucrania Rusia Ucrania Vladimir Putin Volodímir Zelenski Miguel Flores Rostyslav Averchuk Casi dos años después del comienzo de guerra, Rusia y Ucrania han hecho balance del desempeño en el frente de batalla este 2023. Ambos países llegan a la misma conclusión: en un tablero internacional tan volátil, la carrera armamentística se gana invirtiendo en la producción doméstica . Este jueves, la corporación estatal rusa Rostec anunció que la producción de munición para armas ligeras y de misiles para lanzaderas se multiplicó 50 veces desde el comienzo de la guerra en Ucrania.\nKiev busca seguir la estela de Moscú, aunque las posibilidades son mucho más limitadas. De cara al año próximo, Ucrania se propone duplicar la producción nacional de armas, que ya se triplicó de 2022 a 2023. El Gobierno de Volodímir Zelenski persigue dejar de depender de la provisión de municiones extranjeras: tras el paquete de ayuda militar por valor de 250 millones de dólares anunciado por Estados Unidos el miércoles, Kiev no espera grandes aportaciones de Washington en 2024. Al Congreso estadounidense ya le costó aprobar el lote de esta semana, y no hay indicios de que el país norteamericano acuerde más proyectos de financiación a Ucrania en los próximos meses.\nLas entregas del millón de proyectiles de artillería prometido por la Unión Europea también van mucho más lentas de lo esperado. A finales de noviembre, Ucrania sólo había recibido 300.000, según el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores. Es poco probable que la UE envíe a tiempo el resto, unos 700.000 proyectiles, antes de marzo de 2024. Mientras tanto, los soldados ucranianos han reducido considerablemente el número de proyectiles de artillería que disparan cada día, según diversos informes procedentes desde la línea del frente. Se ven obligados a racionar las existencias restantes mientras hacen frente a la creciente presión rusa, informa Efe .\n[ La UE prepara un plan B de ayuda de 20.000 millones a Ucrania para esquivar el veto de Hungría ]\nEl desarrollo de la producción nacional adquiere especial importancia en tales condiciones, según dejaron claro el miércoles altos funcionarios ucranianos en una serie de declaraciones dedicadas al sector de defensa del país. Según el ministro de Industrias Estratégicas, Olexandr Kamishin, 300.000 ucranianos están empleados actualmente en 500 empresas del sector . Su producción se triplicó en 2023 y se espera que se duplique en 2024, reveló Kamishin, según informa Ukrinform .\n200 de las empresas del sector están implicadas en la producción de drones, que cada vez son más importantes en el campo de batalla. Según Zelenski, se espera producir un millón de drones \"suicidas\" de corto alcance en 2024, mientras el Estado busca una mayor celeridad en sus actuaciones, tras un lento comienzo en el que fue criticado por mostrar poca iniciativa en asegurar la ventaja de Ucrania en este ámbito.\nUn programa de financiación de 1.000 millones de euros , puesto en marcha por el gobierno en 2023, ha contribuido a acelerar su producción, subrayó Kamishin. Ucrania también debería tratar de reducir su dependencia del suministro de piezas de repuesto procedentes de China, aunque no es probable que esto ocurra pronto, según había declarado anteriormente a Efe Yuri Kovalchuk , productor voluntario de drones de Leópolis.\nSegún Kovalchuk, una ventaja importante de los productores ucranianos es que pueden contar con la reacción constante de los soldados para aumentar la eficacia de los drones. También se ha avanzado en la producción de artillería, con seis obuses Bogdana listos cada mes , reveló Kamishin. Señaló que Ucrania ha estado trabajando en la creación de sus propios sistemas de defensa antiaérea, al tiempo que se negó a revelar detalles sobre el programa \"más importante\", el de misiles de largo alcance.\n[ Rusia da por abortada la contraofensiva ucraniana: \"La misión de 2023 fue cumplida con éxito\" ]\nSin embargo, seguir el ejemplo del enemigo puede no ser la idea más inteligente para Ucrania. En Rusia, varios medios independientes han denunciado que Rostec elude las sanciones impuestas por Occidente por medio de compañías fantasmas que les permiten importar componentes sujetos a restricciones e indispensables para la fabricación de misiles y drones.\nTanto Putin como el ministro de Defensa ruso, Serguéi Shoigú , han informado durante el último año sobre el incremento de la producción de armas en el país. Según informó el mandatario ruso en septiembre pasado, la producción de blindados se incrementó al triple durante los primeros nueve meses de este año. Putin ha llamado en varias ocasiones a aumentar también la fabricación de medios antiaéreos , de lucha antibatería y en particular de drones.\n¿Es posible no depender de EEUU? En 2024, es probable que en el caso de Ucrania la dependencia del extranjero continúe. Kiev ha multiplicado por 42 su producción de granadas de mortero y por tres la de proyectiles de artillería en 2023, aunque no se espera que la producción de proyectiles de artillería de 155 mm estándar de la OTAN, tan urgentemente necesarios, comience hasta 2024. \"Por desgracia, en este calibre dependemos de nuestros socios , dependemos del suministro de la pólvora de disponibilidad limitada\", explicó Kamishin.\nA pesar de los progresos en algunos ámbitos en 2023, la producción nacional sólo podría aspirar a disminuir la dependencia de Ucrania de los suministros del exterior y no a eliminarla por completo , dijo a Efe Oleksí Melnik, experto militar del Centro Razumkov. \"Más bien podría complementar [la ayuda exterior] y reducir el nivel actualmente crítico de dependencia de la ayuda exterior\", subrayó Melnik al señalar que ningún país del mundo es capaz de producir todas las armas completamente por sí mismo.\n[ Ucrania combate sobre el hielo mientras espera la munición que no llega de Occidente ]\nLa escasez de especialistas altamente cualificados y la financiación insuficiente probablemente seguirán obstaculizando la producción nacional, advirtió Kovalchuk asimismo. Para superar las dificultades, el Estado debería liderar la producción de armas, aunque las empresas privadas, más flexibles, y los voluntarios civiles deberían seguir desempeñando un papel importante, considera Melnik.\nSigue los temas que te interesan",
