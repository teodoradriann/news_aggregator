    "text": "The Reason Bedside Baby Bed Is Everyone's Obsession In 2024\nBedside Baby Beds\nBaby bedside cribs let parents keep their newborn close during the night without compromising on safety. They are designed specifically for newborns and can be used up to 4 to 6 months.\nThe Halo Bassinest is a swivel-over-the-parent's-bed that has the ability to be pushed down to let parents pick up their infant during feeding times at night. However, the base won't be able to fit under beds less than 4.5 inches high.\nSafety features\nA crib that is placed at the bedside allows parents to monitor, comfort and feed their children at night without having leave their bed. This arrangement of sleeping is ideal for new mothers recovering from childbirth or with mobility issues. It may also help parents sleep better at night. It is essential to think about safety features when purchasing a bedside crib.\nThe primary safety concern for this type of sleep surface is that it's not a complete barrier between the bed of the parent and the baby's sleeping space, resulting in gaps that could pose the risk of suffocation for infants. Sharing a bed increases the body heat of the parent and can increase the risk of overheating. This could result in SIDS.\nAlthough some manufacturers claim that bedside co-sleepers are more secure than traditional cribs, these products aren't subject to the the safety standards of the CPSC. They could have the slats which allow babies' legs or heads to become trapped and their attachment mechanisms can be unstable and lead to separation.\nMany of these surfaces also contain loose bedding, which can lead to suffocation. Babies don't have the muscle or coordination to free themselves from entanglement in soft bedding, and gaps between the frame and the mattress can cause a suffocation risk. Some of these products also have a hard bottom that can hurt a child when they fall on it. One commenter suggested the CPSC include pictograms in warnings to these products. This could decrease the likelihood that caregivers miss key elements. In addition, bedside cribs should come with a smooth transition mechanism to keep the baby from falling off the bed of their parents.\nBedding\nA bedside crib (also called a co-sleeper or bassinet) lets babies sleep next to their parents' beds, while maintaining a separate space. This type of safe co-sleeping helps reduce the risk of suffocation and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome by keeping babies close to their parents.\nBaby bedding for a bedside sleeper could include crib sheets blankets, bumpers, and toys. Make sure that the bedding you select is appropriate for the bedside sleeper to avoid pockets or bulges that could obstruct the baby's breathing. Also, ensure that the mattress you buy for your bedside sleeper is firm and fits comfortably without gaps around the edges.\nIf you're looking for a bedding set that will keep your baby clean in case they fall or spill up in the night, choose something that is easy to wash and dry. You may also want to think about a travel bag for your bedside sleeper, to make it easy to carry it around when you travel with your family or visit grandparents home.\nIf your baby has outgrown the bedside sleeper, you can move your child to a crib or toddler that is all on its own. When you transition to a crib, move it away from the parents' bed over a period of time, either weeks or months, to let your child learn to sleep in his own space but still feel connected to them. Be sure to choose a crib that is able to fold easily for storage and transportation. Some cribs can be converted to a play yard or deeper bassinet. This makes them an excellent choice for parents who frequently travel.\nTilt function\nA bedside sleeper, also referred to as bassinet is a bassinet that is attached to the bed's side for adults. One side is lower than the other to allow parents to reach their child at night. It could have tilt features that help ease reflux in infants. Some parents have found that this feature can help their child sleep better. It is important to keep in mind that a slanted, or elevated, sleeping surface could encourage your baby's chin to the chest position. This can cause suffocation, and should be avoided.\nA good mattress is crucial in deciding on the right crib for your child's bed. It must be flat and firm as well as ventilated. The mattress should be similar to the size of the crib and fit comfortably into the frame. It is recommended to buy a new mattress for your crib as a second-hand one could increase the chance of SIDS. Some retailers offer mattresses designed for specific bed frames, therefore it is recommended to stick with those if you can.\nSome cribs designed for bedside are made to tuck under your bed to save space and bring your child close, such as the Halo BassiNest. However certain beds are too low for this kind of crib. The feet that are splayed out of the BassiNest make it difficult to slide under some beds. It's also difficult to slide it under a divan bed, which can cause it to slide or sway out of alignment with the mattress.\nOther types of bedside bassinets such as the Ingenuity Sleep and Grow Bedside Crib can be set close to your mattress however, they aren't able to tilt. CHOICE recommends that parents use these beds if they have a solid air-conditioned bed. The tilt of a bassinet or bedside crib can encourage your baby to fall into a dangerous position and increase the risk of suffocation.\nPosition of foot-to-foot\nA bedside crib, also known as a co-sleeper or a bassinet, is a small crib that is attached to the side of a bed for adults. This allows parents to access their child easily at night. They are generally larger than the standard cots and bassinets.\nSome cribs for bed have a tilt feature that can aid babies suffering from digestive issues such as reflux or colic. It's important to use the tilt function with care and at a very small angle to avoid from suffocation. Consult your physician or health professional if you are unsure whether to use the feature.\nThe mattress is another important safety factor to consider when selecting a crib for your child's bedside. To minimize the risk of SIDS, the mattress should be flat, firm and airy. A mattress that is too firm can result in obstruction of the airway in infants, which can lead to danger. A breathable mattress can also help your child remain cool during the night, which reduces the risk of overheating.\nIt's recommended that you put your baby to sleep in their own safe sleeping area - either a crib, cot, or Moses basket. It could be tempting to sleep in the same bed with your baby, but this can result in SIDS. It's best to wait until your baby is old enough to sleep independently before you attempt to co-sleep. If you must, ensure that your bedroom is smoke-free in order to protect your child from secondhand smoke. Plunket can assist with a crib or bassinet for those with a low income.\nSecond-hand cribs\nParents looking to save money might be tempted by a second-hand bassinet, crib, or cradle that they receive from a relative or friend. But, cribs are among of the most common causes of deaths involving nursery products, especially when older ones have missing or damaged parts or have larger spaces between slats (which could lead to suffocation risks). In addition, older mattresses may develop dips and other conditions that could pose danger to your child. And if a crib is old enough to be predated by the safety guidelines in place it may be contaminated by lead paint, and could contain other toxic chemicals.\nIf you are considering a used crib, always look to see if it has been removed from sale by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It's also an excellent idea to determine whether the crib has been painted with water-based paint which is much safer for infants than phthalic or oil paint. Ensure that the mattress is firm, and that it fits comfortably. Babies can easily slip off mattresses that are soft and also present a risk of suffocation.\nBe especially cautious of used bassinets and cradles as well as play yards. All of them should be JPMA-certified, and free of sharp edges that could scratch or poke your baby. Avoid putting blankets, pillows or toys to these products which could create entrapment hazards.\nInfants have died in cribs that were altered or tampered with. The majority of these deaths occurred when parents or caregivers tried to make the cribs functional or more attractive by adding or modifying items. Since 1973, crib makers and the CPSC have teamed up to establish standards that are mandatory for cribs that are safer, and have addressed issues like side height, slat spacing, corner posts, mattress fit and cutouts on end panels. In the last few years the number of deaths attributed to cribs has dropped from 150 to 200 per year to just 50.\nBaby bedside cribs let parents keep their newborn close during the night without compromising on safety.

    "text": "Jayson Tatum Far from Satisfied, Eying Next Championship Ring After First NBA Title Jayson Tatum was recently hanging out with friend and championship teammate Oshae Brissett at the Auerbach Center as the Celtics were getting fitted for the rings they'll receive on opening night, Oct. 22, prior to their rivalry clash against the Knicks to kick off the 2024-25 NBA season. Brissett captured the conversation for all to see, filming the two talking about where they want the placement of their rings on his vlog, [BrissyTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH2BBAiD1S4), which includes the use of explicit language. His doing so provided the latest example that the Celtics are far from satisfied after capturing Banner 18. “I was going pinky, but index, going to save the pinky for the next one,” Tatum said to Brissett in the video. “I got middle finger,” the latter joked. Tatum also utilized the Celtics reconvening to get fitted for their championship rings to [deliver a warning](https://www.si.com/nba/celtics/top-stories/jayson-tatum-shares-warning-to-celtics-at-championship-ring-fitting-01j6fxdyjy1n) to the team as it aims to become the first since the 2017 and 2018 Warriors to win back-to-back championships. Between Jaylen Brown's Olympic snub, which he [said](https://www.si.com/nba/celtics/top-stories/jaylen-brown-wasn-t-surprised-by-team-usa-summer-olympics-snub-01j2x3vfy84z) is providing him with \"all the motivation in the world,\" and Tatum getting benched multiple times in Paris, which he [described](https://www.si.com/nba/celtics/top-stories/jayson-tatum-opens-up-about-challenging-and-humbling-team-usa-paris-olympics-experience-01j4zjgpy9c9) as \"challenging and humbling,\" the Celtics have ample ammunition as their upcoming title defense turns into a revenge tour.

    "title": "Daily Mail Torches \"LIAR\" Janet Mills Over Bogus Claim National Weather Service Didn't Forecast Storm - The Maine Wire",
    "text": "The Daily Mail, one of the biggest newspapers in western civilization, roasted Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) on Thursday for making false claims about warnings provided to her administration by the National Weather Service in advance of a devastating Dec. 18 wind storm. [[RELATED: Bangor News Outlet Removes “False Criticism” from Headline to Make Storm Story Janet-Friendly…]](https://www.themainewire.com/2023/12/bangor-news-outlet-removes-false-criticism-from-headline-to-make-storm-story-janet-friendly/) “Maine’s Democrat Governor Janet Mills is branded a LIAR by the National Weather Service after she claimed they didn’t warn her historic storm would bring up to six inches of rain,” screamed the Mail’s headline. “ [Maine](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/maine/index.html)‘s [Democrat](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/democrats/index.html) Governor Janet Mills has been branded a liar by the National Weather Service after claiming its forecasters didn’t warn her about a historic storm,” wrote reporter Sophie Mann. The storm left more than half of Maine without electricity, yet Mills made no public appearance until more than 36 hours after the power outages began. The Maine Wire has filed a public records request with the Governor’s Office seeking her official schedule for the time period surrounding the NWS forecast, the storm, and her response. From the Mail: The esteemed federal agency lashed Mills after she was slammed for failing to adequately warn locals that up to half a foot of rain would fall on December 18, causing huge floods and leaving 400,000 without power. Mills put her foot in it last Wednesday while touring flood-battered Kennebec County, saying: ‘The National Weather Service did not predict five or six inches of rain in any community in Maine.’ But a NWS spokesman said the 75 year-old lawmaker was talking nonsense, insisting state and local officials had been briefed about the impending inundation on December 15. And on Sunday the 17th – the day before the storm – the weather service met with state officials to further brief them on expected flooding, winds, and impact to the state’s coast line.",

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar Recruits SZA For Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show [Watch]",
    "text": "[Update 1/23/25]: Kendrick Lamar will be joined by frequent collaborator SZA when he headlines the Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show at New Orleans, LA’s Caesars Superdome on February 9th, 2025. In a promo clip shared on Tuesday, SZA announces her appearance by running up behind Kendrick on a football field set and dousing him with a celebratory cooler full of lemonade as his 2024 track “hey now” plays in the background.\nPlenty has happened for both Kendrick Lamar and SZA since the rapper’s Super Bowl headlining gig was announced in October 2024. Following the initial announcement, New Orleans-native rapper Lil Wayne was vocal about his disappointment that he was not offered the halftime show in his home city. “That hurt, it hurt a lot,” he said in a statement posted on Instagram. “It broke me, but I’m just trying to put myself back together.”\nLamar went on to release his sixth studio album, GNX, on November 22nd. The feeling of immediacy that pervades the LP is perhaps most apparent in a line from opening track “wacced out murals” that directly references Wayne’s comments a month prior: “Used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud / Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down.”\nGNX also featured two separate collaborations with SZA, “luther” and “gloria”. The prolific pair added to their joint resume yet again when SZA’s new SOS Deluxe: LANA, released on December 20th, featured a third new Kendrick collab, “30 For 30”.\nKendrick Lamar and SZA also announced an extensive co-headlining stadium tour dubbed the Grand National Tour. Due to run from mid-April through mid-June, the 21-date trek’s billing is a nod to GNX, which takes its name from the limited-run 1987 Buick “Grand National Experiment” coup, a model known by many as one of the last great American muscle cars. Find a full list of dates here. Tickets are on sale now via Ticketmaster.

While he uses a passing machine to fire off practice throws to an off-camera receiver, Lamar deadpans, “What the deal, everybody? My name Kendrick Lamar and I’ll be performing at Super Bowl LIX [59]. Will you be pullin’ up? I hope so.”\n“Boom!” he adds as one of his passes seems to hit its receiver in the numbers. “I wouldn’t want you to miss it. Meet me in New Orleans. February 9th, 2025. Wear your best dress, too, even if you’re watching from home.”\nWhile the Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show will mark Lamar’s first time leading the annual spectacle, he notably appeared during the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show in Inglewood, CA alongside fellow hip-hop luminaries like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Eminem, 50 Cent, and Anderson .Paak in early 2022. That edition marked the first time a rapper had headlined the Halftime Show. Read our full rundown of that performance and its significance here.\nRelated: Dr. Dre & His Protégés: Hip-Hop Royalty Finally Captures The Super Bowl Halftime Show Stage\nLamar also seemingly throws another jab at Drake in the announcement video. Earlier this year, after the two rappers traded dis tracks for weeks this past spring, Lamar’s scathing “Not Like Us” helped him pull away as the war of words’ consensus winner. He only added to that perception on Juneteenth when he hosted a one-off show at L.A.’s Kia Forum billed as The Pop Out during which he welcomed out a crew of notable guests including Mustard, Ty Dolla Sign, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy, Tyler, the Creator, Roddy Ricch, YG, Schoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and Dr. Dre. and performed four of his five Drake-aimed diss tracks—”Like That”, “Euphoria”, “6:16 in LA”, and “Not Like Us”—for the first time during his headlining set. Seemingly adding insult to injury, Lamar performed “Not Like Us”, the de facto “nail in the coffin” for the Kendrick/Drake beef, five separate times at the show.\nNote: There are plenty of explanations and [breakdowns of the Kendrick Lamar/Drake feud out there online, but we think this explanation Chet Hanks gave his dad, Tom Hanks, is as good as any.]\n[Screengrabs via Chet Hanks Instagram – Chet Hanks explains Kendrick/Drake beef to Tom Hanks, May 2024]\nWhile things seemed to simmer down after that, Drake has since begun dumping large caches of music, demos, video clips, and other content in 100gb chunks. At the time of his first “100 Gigs” drop, Drake posted an Instagram story on his @plottttwistttttt Instagram account featuring a photo of former professional basketball player Rasheed Wallace and accompanying text quoting a famous 2004 interview by the Detroit Piston during the NBA Finals: “We will win Game 2.” Many fans took the eventually deleted post as both an admission of his defeat in the rap beef du jour and a forecast of his intentions to come at Kendrick once again in the future.\n[Related: Kendrick Lamar Brings ‘The Big Steppers Tour’ To New Orleans [Review]](https://liveforlivemusic.com/features/reviews/kendrick-lamar-mr-morale-the-big-steppers-tour-2022-new-orleans/)\nIn the video announcing Lamar’s Super Bowl performance, as the American flag towers behind him, Kendrick throws a bit more “sweet chin music” at Drake, his Canadian rival. “You know there’s only one opportunity to win a championship. No ’round twos.’ Let’s get it!”\nWatch the full announcement video for Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show below.\nView this post on Instagram",

Depuis le lundi 22 janvier, la circulation est perturbée sur les lignes 2 et 3 du tramway à Marseille en raison d' un incendie dans un parking souterrain de la rue de la République.\nUn incendie dans un parking souterrain à Marseille en 2024 © Métropole de Marseille Des navettes en place La métropole a demandé à la RTM de mettre en place des bus de substitution. Dès vendredi, des aménagements sur la circulation des lignes vont entrer en vigueur pour gagner en fluidité.\nLes stations Arenc le Silo, Euromèd Gantès et Joliette seront desservies par une rame de tramway avec une fréquence de 10 minutes, rapporte la RTM dans un communiqué.\nLa ligne sera exploitée dans les deux sens de circulation mais sur une voie unique \"afin de permettre la correspondance avec le métro M2 à La Joliette ainsi qu'avec le service de bus de substitution navette tram\", précise-t-elle.\nLe service de substitution assurera la liaison entre La Joliette et Canebière Bourse \"avec en moyenne un bus toutes les sept minutes en heure de pointe\".\nÀ partir de la Joliette, un système de navette sera mis en place, de 5h30 à 00h30, pour descendre jusqu’à Belsunce Alcazar avec une fréquence de 7-8 minutes en heure de pointe et de 10-12 minutes pour le soir.\nLe point trafic après les perturbations sur le tramway T2-T3 à Marseille. © Métropole de Marseille Pour les usagers qui souhaitent se rendre à Arenc le Silo peuvent \"au-delà de la ligne de métro M2, également emprunter le bus 82 en correspondance aux Vieux Port ou la ligne de bus 35 à la station Métro Joliette\".\nLa RTM rappelle que le tramway T2 circule normalement entre les stations Belsunce-Alcazar et La Blancarde, indique la RTM dans son communiqué. Les stations République-Dames et Sadi Carnot ne sont pas desservies.\nLe T3 circule lui aussi normalement entre le Cours Saint-Louis et Castellane. Trois stations ne sont toutefois pas desservies: Républiques-Dames, Sadi Carnot et Belsunce-Alcazar.\nConcernant la circulation routière, une voie de circulation est maintenue du nord vers le sud de rue Catala à Sadi Carnot. La route est fermée totalement dans le sens Joliette-Vieux-Port mais la circulation est maintenue dans l'autre sens. Concernant la rue François Moisson et la rue Catala, les automobilistes pourront traverser la plateforme du tramway.\nSur le même sujet Marseille: deux individus en garde à vue après un incendie dans un parking Marseille: l'incendie au parking République a \"potentiellement\" causé des dommages sur le sol où passe le tramway Le parking souterrain est, lui, visé par un arrêté de mise en péril.
