Bargaining Committee, which represents more than 12,000 Stater Bros. workers in Southern California, has reached a tentative agreement with the grocer, the group announced on Wednesday.\nThe agreement includes higher wages, increased pension contributions, improved health care, enhanced staffing and safety measures, and more.\nWorkers must now vote on the deal. Had a deal not been reached, it would have been the first strike in the grocer’s history. “We look forward to sharing and discussing the details of this agreement with our coworkers before we make our voices heard during the voting process,” the UFCW Stater Bros. Bargaining Committee said in a statement.\nStater Bros. employees had been working under an expired contract since March. On Monday, some gathered at a store in Pasadena, California, to urge shoppers to boycott the location. Workers had threatened to escalate their actions if a deal was not reached soon.\n“Negotiations were conducted in good faith, with both sides working hard to reach a fair deal that supports our teammates and helps keep prices steady for our customers,” Stater Bros. said in an emailed statement to Supermarket News. “We appreciate the collaborative effort and are encouraged that the union is recommending the agreement for ratification.”\nWorkers had pushed for a deal similar to the one reached in July for 45,000 employees at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions. That new three-year contract includes wage increases, a supplemental pension plan, expanded health care benefits, and improved staffing levels.\nThe union filed charges against Stater Bros. with the National Labor Relations Board. The allegations include:\nUnlawful surveillance of members active in the contract campaign\nDiscrimination against members based on union support\nUnlawful interrogation of members\nRetaliation against union supporters\nBypassing the union to negotiate directly with employees\nFailing to provide information necessary for collective bargaining\nRead more about:\nStater Bros.\nAbout the Author\nYou May Also Like",

I normally like this type of terrain but today I didn’t feel 100 percent comfortable so I didn’t want to push too hard. I didn’t lose too much time so that puts us in a good place for tomorrow. We’ve been testing some things on the bike too, which is very important in preparation for the next Dakar.”",

    "text": "Tuesday, January 16: The Kashmir Valley’s scenic beauty has been marred by the dearth of snowfall activity over the region in the last 45 days — leaving both locals and residents bereft. Travellers visiting Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Sonmarg and Doodhpathri have been left disappointed by the absence of snow these places are so famous for. And the locals have even more pressing problems, like water shortage and a dry cold holding them hostage. Unfortunately, immediate respite from the bitter frost seems unlikely, with weather models projecting the ongoing dry spell to continue for almost ten more days, until January 24. However, we come bearing some good tidings today. Wet weather will make a soft comeback in Jammu & Kashmir and its neighbouring areas this week. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a fresh but feeble western disturbance will be impacting the Western Himalayan Region starting tonight, January 16. And under its influence, Jammu-Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh will be in for light rainfall/snowfall activity on Tuesday and Wednesday, January 16 and 17. Similar conditions will prevail over Uttarakhand on Wednesday and Thursday, January 17 and 18. Dense fog will also continue blanketing some of these areas in the morning and night hours of Tuesday. Given these forecasts, a yellow watch has been issued over the region so as to urge people to “be updated” about the wet conditions and foggy weather. As for the mercury levels, no significant changes are likely. Nighttime temperatures have continued to slip in Kashmir, remaining in deep freeze with bone chilling cold on Tuesday. Jammu city continued to reel under unusually low night temperature as people struggled to keep themselves warm. On Tuesday morning, Srinagar recorded -4.6°C, Gulmarg -3.1°C and Pahalgam -5.4°C as the minimum temperature. Leh town in Ladakh region had -10.4°C, and Kargil -12.3°C as the night’s lowest temperature. As we approach the end 40-day long period of harsh winter cold known as the ‘Chillai Kalan’ around January 30, the people of Jammu & Kashmir will experience some relief. Meanwhile, the Kashmir Valley has barely witnessed any snowfall, resulting in a deficit of 79% for the month of December in 2023 and a shortfall of 100% in January 2024 so far. However, the precipitation forecast for January 25-27 is encouraging. According to MeT director Mukhtar Ahmad, there is a possibility of light rain/snow at scattered places from January 25 to 27 as per indications of different models. ** For weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).
