    "title": "Quad-City Times: Caitlin Clark transforms and inspires",
    "text": "Breaking long-held records and barriers and scaling obstacles to open doors to new possibilities, both Caitlin Clark and Solomon Butler changed the world around them.\nMost of us are lucky to make some small impact on the people closest to us.\nClark has changed women’s basketball, entertained hundreds of thousands and inspired a generation of young athletes. All the while, she’s acknowledged those around her and has lacked the hubris we might expect from the all-time leading scorer in the NCAA Division I basketball who helps sell out arenas wherever she plays.\nClark isn’t just a scorer, she’s a team leader and a team player, known for her sharp passes to teammates. She leads the Big Ten in career assists and ranks 15th for career assists in the NCAA.\nThe way Clark scores is also game-changing. She broke the NCAA women’s career scoring mark with a 35-foot three-pointer. Keep in mind, the NBA three-point line at the top of the key is 23 feet and 9 inches. According to CBB Analytics, Clark has hit 84 three-pointers this season from beyond 25 feet. She sank 76 from that distance last season. The next seven players with the most “long threes” since 2018, when the stat began being tracked, are all men.\nPeople are also reading…\nAll across Iowa and beyond, girls are sporting Clark’s \"22\" on shirts and jackets. They are motivated by Clark’s accomplishments. Seeing is believing.\nClark is a remarkable, transformational, once-in-a-generation athlete.\nClark’s exceptional feats were made possible by pioneers in women’s basketball, such as Lynette Woodard and Pearl Moore, who remains the top scorer in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Before the 1981-82 season, the NCAA didn’t recognize or fund women’s basketball or other sports.\nSometimes the spotlight eludes the trailblazers, or flickers out prematurely.\nButler broke barriers in NFL\nSuch was the case with Butler, the second Black quarterback in the NFL. With the Jim Crow era in full force, Butler played professional football decades before Jackie Robinson broke the professional baseball color barrier in 1947.\nHe competed in the 1920 Olympics, 16 years before Jesse Owens’ world famous four-gold-medal performance.\nThe Dispatch-Argus and Quad-City Times of Iowa recently published a story about David Sebben’s book: “Nothing Great is Easily Won: The Solomon Butler Story.”\nButler graduated from Rock Island High School in 1915.\nAt the University of Dubuque, he earned 12 varsity letters in football, track, basketball and baseball. From there he won gold in the 1920 Olympics for long jump.\nButler entered the NFL for the Rock Island Independents in 1923 as the league’s second Black quarterback. He also played for the Hammond Pros and the Canton Bulldogs.\nWhile he was a quarterback for Canton Bulldogs, the New York Giants refused to play against Butler because of his race. They insisted Butler withdraw for the game. He was the starting quarterback.\nIn 1925, he took a break from the NFL and played professional baseball for the Kansas City Monarchs in the Black baseball leagues. Black players were not yet allowed in the Major Leagues.\nAs David Sebben, author of \"Nothing Great is Easily Won: The Solomon Butler Story,\" puts it: “He met (racism) head-on … A lot of people, even in his day, looked up to him.”\nSolomon went on to become the sports editor for the Chicago Bee and The Defender, two of Chicago’s prominent Black newspapers, and he helped found what is now the Harlem Globetrotters.\nQuincy Black, a junior at Rock Island High School, finds inspiration in Butler’s story.\n“It’s really shown me that I should take advantage of the opportunities I have now,” Black told the Dispatch-Argus. He hopes to emulate many of Butler’s qualities.\nThe best athletes transcend sports, expanding equality and opportunity for those who follow.",

    "title": "A Black Hole Is Causing Stars To Explode",
    "text": "Scientists observing the black hole in the M87 galaxy have discovered that it seems to be causing nearby stars to explode. A jet of plasma emanating from the region destroys celestial bodies they come in contact with, but even stars too close to the jets explode at an increased rate. The cause of these celestial explosions remains a scientific mystery.\nStars Are Erupting Using the Hubble Space Telescope, researchers have found that white dwarf stars near the black hole’s plasma jet were twice as likely to become novae.\nThe phenomenon occurred exclusively in two star systems with the smaller dwarf star erupting.\nThese types of eruptions usually happen when the older companion star spews hydrogen, which is absorbed by the dwarf star until it explodes in a nova, but the jet may be speeding that process up somehow.\nBlack Hole Possibilities The higher rate of novae in the area leads to two possibilities: either the region around the black hole has twice as many two-star systems, or the white dwarfs in the region are twice as likely to erupt.\nResearchers are leaning towards the second possibility as the more likely option. That would mean that the jet itself is doing something to the stars.\nThe idea researchers initially proposed was that the black hole jet caused the dwarf’s companion star to heat up as it passed by. That would cause the companion star to spew out more hydrogen, which could kick-start the nova eruption.\nHowever, this idea was dismissed based on the amount of heat that process would require.\nPlasma Jet Pushing A more likely possibility is that the black hole plasma jet is pushing hydrogen into the white dwarf stars as it passes by.\nThe pressure from the jet could cause a more rapid absorption of hydrogen, setting off the explosion.\nEither an increased rate of absorption or the presence of more actual hydrogen in the system could cause the eruption to occur faster than normal.\nStudying It Closely Scientists have been studying the M87 black hole closely for years, but their impact on nearby space is still being understood.\nScientists were aware of the 3,000 light-year-long plasma jet traveling at close to light speed but hadn’t realized how catastrophic it was to the celestial bodies it passed by.\nThis discovery could illuminate more about what causes stars to erupt and the nature of the mysterious plasma jet in M87.\nHubble Space Telescope Images The discovery was made by taking photos of the area around the black hole from the Hubble Space Telescope with new, higher-quality cameras.\nThese wide-view cameras allowed researchers to count novae eruptions in M87 and compare them to other regions of space. Taking pictures of the galaxy every five days, scientists were able to calculate the rate of explosions.\nA New Layer Of Mystery For those researching black holes, the incredible power of a plasma jet generated by the phenomenon adds a new layer of mystery.\nThe fact that the jet is powerful enough to detonate nearby stars as it streaks through space is awe-inspiring.\nNow that scientists are aware of the phenomenon they can set about studying the celestial event to understand why the jet causes stars to explode.\nSource: NASA",

    "title": "July temperatures set national record - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "China experienced its hottest month on record in July, with the highest average temperature since the country began releasing comprehensive data in 1961, the China Meteorological Administration said on Thursday. Jia Xiaolong, deputy director of the National Climate Center, said the national average temperature hit a record 23.2 C last month, 1.1 C higher than in the previous hottest July dating back to 1961. \"In July, China encountered a combination of extreme heavy rainfall and extreme high temperatures nationwide,\" Jia said at a news conference in Beijing. Southern China faced a widespread and prolonged heat wave in July, with multiple regions experiencing continuous high temperatures for over 20 days. A total of 59 national meteorological stations recorded daily maximum temperatures that broke or hit historical records. Temperatures above 41 C were observed in places like Cili in Hunan province, Tongshan in Hubei province and Lishui in Zhejiang province, Jia said. Hot weather records were shattered around the world last month, with July 22 being Earth's hottest day on record as the global daily average temperature reached 17.15 C. The sudden rise in average daily temperature from July 21 to 22 was mainly due to significantly higher than average temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America and Europe, as well as most of Antarctica, Jia said. According to forecasts, temperatures in most parts of China will remain higher than usual this month. Two significant heat waves will hit in the first half of August, and the high temperatures are expected to ease late in the month, the CMA said. In July, national average precipitation was 140 millimeters, 15 percent more than in the same period in previous years and the third highest since 1961. The previous two records, when the country was hit by catastrophic floods, were 148 mm in July 1996 and 146.8 mm in July 1998. Frequent heavy rains battered a large expanse of China from north to south last month, with the provinces of Shandong and Jilin receiving their highest precipitation since 1961. Daily precipitation records were broken at 33 national meteorological stations. Among them, Sheqi in Henan province, Hengshan in Hunan province and Pingyi in Shandong saw daily precipitation exceed 300 mm. Jia said the rainy season in North China began on July 22, and on July 30 Beijing experienced its most intense rainfall since the start of flood season. Local authorities urged extra efforts to prevent secondary disasters such as floods and landslides, he said. A total of 2,492 red alerts were issued nationwide in July, an 84 percent increase compared to the average for the month in the previous seven years, he added. Two-thirds of the red alerts were for heavy rain. zhaoyimeng@chinadaily.com.cn [July temperatures set national record](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/02/WS66ac1d85a3104e74fddb80ee.html) [Ten photos from across China: July 26 - Aug 1](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/02/WS66ac0ec0a3104e74fddb80ca.html) [State Grid's Jiaxing unit facilitates major green certificate transactions](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/01/WS66ab8ac2a3104e74fddb80a7.html) [Mailing: The rising town of shoemaking in Central China](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/01/WS66ab89cea3104e74fddb80a1.html) [China's green electricity trading sees remarkable growth in 2024](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/01/WS66ab7b08a3104e74fddb8098.html) [Rescue and cleanup efforts intensify in flood-hit Hunan](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/01/WS66ab77bda3104e74fddb808f.html)",
