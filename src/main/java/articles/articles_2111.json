    "title": "A blow in Junín: Racing misplaced within the go to to Sarmiento for the League Match",
    "text": "Coup on Wednesday evening. Racing Membership misplaced 1-0 on the go to to Sarmiento, for the seventh date of the League Match The match was performed on the Juan Domingo Perón stadium in Junín and thus the Academy was left and not using a probability to take a giant step within the struggle for these on the prime of the desk.\nNaya scored the profitable objective for Sarmiento towards Racing, in Junín. Fotobaires\nAssociated 2 Associated\nRacing, which arrived in Junín with 13 factors, one level away from the highest of the championship, is undoubtedly one of many candidates to struggle for the title as a result of hierarchy of its squad. It arrived in an incredible second from a footballing viewpoint and leads the annual desk along with River and Talleres. It’s the crew that received probably the most on the native stage in 2024, however suffered an affect away from dwelling.\nSarmiento has a transparent goal: to remain within the league. El Verde is aware of that it should add factors to keep away from relegation and that’s the objective proposed along with its coach Israel Damonte. It was in twenty sixth place within the annual factors desk and twenty fifth within the common desk and now it’s wanting ahead to climbing the ranks.\nThe customer began higher and the scorer Adrián Maravilla Martínez warned, however The rating was opened by Ezequiel Naya, for Sarmiento. At 20 minutes, in his first match on the membership He transformed from the correct within the penalty space, making the most of the truth that the ball deviated barely off a defender and thus difficult the goalkeeper, the skilled Chilean Gabriel Arias. And the house crew, led by Israel Damonte, grew by stopping the rival very properly and greater than as soon as reaching the opponent’s objective with hazard.\nRacing improved within the second half and got here shut with danger. After a shot by Gastón Martirena at 11 minutes, it was Joaquín Gho who prevented what might have been the Academia’s equalizer after Maravilla Martínez’s end. And the clearest probability got here for the house crew at 22, when Arias blocked a strong shot from Gabriel Gudiño. Many followers of the Verde cheered, believing that it will be the second objective, however they have been left wanting. And Gudiño might have shouted objective once more, when at 42 his shot went simply broad of Arias’ left put up.\nThus, Sarmiento dealt a blow towards Racing, led by Gustavo Costas, a crew that had received six of the final seven video games between the native event and the Copa Sudamericana, however this time lacked adequate soccer towards an organized and neat rival. In all these victories, additionally they saved a clear sheet. However away from dwelling they solely managed one victory within the final 5 duels (4-0 towards Tigre) and earlier than that that they had received 4 in a row away from dwelling.\nRacing was solely capable of declare victory twice in Junín. On this means, Sarmiento, who had misplaced to Central in Arroyito, raised its head a bit. Of the ten earlier matches, it had misplaced seven and its victories over San Lorenzo and Estudiantes stood out. Now it beat one other huge crew like Racing and the Verde had additionally received the earlier match 1-0. And it was a celebration all through its metropolis.",

    "title": "Another Raw Pet Food Tests \"Not-Negative\" for Avian Flu",
    "text": "Savage Cat Food recently made the following statement, posted on their website :\n“Savage Pet was made aware of one cat in Colorado who contracted highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), got sick and recovered. The cat owner contacted the retailer who notified us on January 30, 2025. Savage Pet contacted the Colorado State Veterinarian for verification but did not receive a response until February 13, 2025. Meanwhile, Colorado contacted the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) who contacted Savage Pet on February 11, 2025.\nThus far, the Colorado State University Laboratory has tested sealed packets of Savage Cat Food using PCR testing for HPAI. The PCR test results are “not negative” for lot number 11152026 (chicken packets). Two other lot codes were tested and the results were negative. The product with “not negative” PCR results has been sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa for virus isolation testing. Virus isolation testing is currently the only laboratory test that determines if the DNA in the product is infective. We are awaiting these test results.\nSavage Pet has always been dedicated to the health of its feline consumers. All of our poultry ingredients are USDA inspected and passed. Our suppliers follow the National Poultry Improvement Plan and work under daily USDA inspection. Savage Pet has adhered to Good Manufacturing Practices and sanitation standard operating procedures for almost 10 years.\nAs a precaution, we have contacted every retailer who may have received the product with lot code/best buy date of 11152026 which was manufactured and sold in Large and Small Chicken Boxes in November 2024. Consumers can cook the packets in a sous vide at 165°F or return them to the retailer for a full refund.”\nSavage Pet Food also provides some Questions and Answers for pet owners, a few we share below:\n“Are you testing the final product for H5N1?\nThere are no FDA-approved food commercially available lab tests available for H5N1/HPAI. We have sent inquiries to our laboratory partners to let us know when a food test becomes available.\nWhat are the safety measures Savage Pet is taking to address H5N1 in their products?\nThe USDA is responsible for keeping H5N1 out of the supply chain by testing flocks and culling any flock with a bird that tests positive. We source only USDA inspected and passed poultry slaughtered for human consumption.”\nThe Bigger Picture TruthaboutPetFood.com has been informed by multiple parties that the ONLY lab in the US that can confirm active Avian Flu in a pet food (or human food) is the National Veterinary Services Laboratories , which is part of the USDA.\nWe sent this USDA laboratory the following questions…\nDoes the National Veterinary Services Laboratories offer testing of pet food samples for avian flu? I am aware you have done testing for Oregon Department of Agriculture, but do you offer testing for the public? I have been told the FDA has instructed your lab to “do not test” for pet food companies or the public, is this correct? It took two attempts, but finally the USDA laboratory responded with:\n“ NVSL has performed PCR testing on pet food samples in collaboration with state public health and animal health departments.\nNVSL primarily conducts testing for regulatory and surveillance purposes in collaboration with state and federal agencies.\nThe FDA has specific guidelines and regulations regarding the testing of pet food and around any claims that may lead to a recall.”\nThe absurdity of only one laboratory in the U.S. having the capability/testing method to confirm active Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu (HPAI) is magnified when you know that this pathogen has been in the U.S. for decades. In a 2015 report prepared by the Congressional Research Services (CRS) for Congress, “ Prior HPAI outbreaks in the United States occurred in 1924, 1983, and 2004. “\nRegarding the 2014/2015 outbreak, this CRS report stated: “The U.S. poultry industry is experiencing a severe outbreak of highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has reported 223 cases of HPAI in domestic flocks in 15 states.”\nIn decades of outbreaks of HPAI – why does only ONE laboratory have the method to confirm a food is positive/infective for such a serious pathogen?\nFor decades, government authorities have done nothing to enable easy-accessible testing of pet food/human food for HPAI. Decade after decade, members of Congress have done nothing to require easy-accessible testing for the public and food industries. How can any food manufacturer assure their products are safe if they have no access to testing?\nBut there is one more thing in the bigger picture…\nThere are currently two pet foods (both raw) that regulatory authorities are claiming to have products HPAI positive: Wild Coast and Savage. With a previous (raw) pet food – Northwest Naturals – regulatory also claimed the product was HPAI positive, however National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed this pet food was NOT contaminated with HPAI. All of these pet foods source ONLY USDA inspected and passed meats; the same meats from the same meat suppliers that sell in your local grocery.\nIF…and we must wait for the National Veterinary Services Laboratories testing of the recently claimed positive products for confirmation (because they are the ONLY lab that can do the confirmation testing)…if these products test positive/infective for HPAI avian flu – this means that the human food chain is likely contaminated as well.\nIF that scenario plays out…will regulatory tell the general public of the risk in their grocery, will meats in the grocery be recalled, or will they only link the Avian Flu to (raw) pet food – misleading the general public?\nTime will tell.\nSusan Thixton\nPet Food Safety Advocate\nAuthor Buyer Beware, Co-Author Dinner PAWsible\nTruthaboutPetFood.com\nAssociation for Truth in Pet Food\nBecome a member of our pet food consumer Association.

    "text": "Amid numerous bipartisan endeavors in the U.S. Senate to revamp the country’s wildfire response apparatus, Sen. Tim Sheehy and fellow Republicans are now looking toward Pres. Trump to expedite change with executive power.\nIn a letter sent Wednesday, 17 Republicans praised Trump’s recent mention of a Federal Wildland Fire Service to provide a “streamlined approach to wildfire response,” and urged him to take “immediate, decisive action”.\n“While some improvements to our federal wildfire response will require congressional action,” the group wrote, “we believe executive action offers the most immediate path to fostering interagency cohesion, streamlining outdated processes, and ensuring a robust response to wildfires.”\nSince his inauguration, Sheehy has introduced or cosponsored 15 bills — many with bipartisan support — aimed at different facets of how the U.S. deals with wildfires, from mandating response times to improving wildland firefighter wages and creating a federal response agency.\nThe letter redirects some focus toward Trump, urging more immediate changes through executive action to how federal, stateand local agencies respond to wildfires.\n“We stand ready to fully support your leadership in protecting American communities from the devastating impacts of catastrophic wildfires,” the letter said.\nSheehy has previously cited the recent fires around Los Angeles that burned some 11,500 homes and $275 billion in damages as a sure sign fire season is a year-round problem.\nWith his background as the co-founder of Bridger Aerospace, he expected he’d attempt to tackle the issue, but he’s said he hadn’t planned on it from the get-go.\n“After L.A., it’s clear now’s the time,” Sheehy recently told the Chronicle.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Laurenz Busch can be reached at 406-582-2633 or lbusch@dailychronicle.com .\n(0 Ratings)",

    "text": "O presidente Lula sancionou, nesta sexta-feira (29), o protocolo conhecido como “Não é Não”, em referência ao movimento “Me Too”, de combate e prevenção à violência contra a mulher em bares, boates e shows que vendam bebida alcoólica.\nA texto de autoria da deputada Maria do Rosário, do PT, teve como inspiração as leis espanholas, que motivaram a prisão do jogador Daniel Alves. Ele prevê o combate contra constrangimento sofrido por mulheres ao discordarem de alguma interação (e o homem continuar insistindo físico ou verbalmente) e também, contra a violência em sim, que diz respeito sobre o uso da força.\nRelacionadas Sociedade Morte brutal da jovem Carol Campêlo escancara invisibilidade do lesbocídio Sociedade Silvio Almeida defende regulação das redes contra fake news Sociedade Menina de 12 anos é vítima de estupro coletivo; namorado é suspeito Os principais pontos exigidos pelo protocolo de combate à violência contra a mulher Os estabelecimentos deverão ter pelo menos uma pessoa no quadro de funcionários qualificada para atender ao protocolo; Ter em locais visíveis cartazes ou panfletos com informações sobre como acionar o protocolo e telefones de contato da Polícia Militar e da Central de Atendimento à Mulher (Ligue 180); Em caso de violência, o local da agressão deve ser preservado até que autoridades investigadoras colham os materiais necessários; As imagens das câmeras de segurança devem ser preservadas por, no mínimo, 30 dias e o estabelecimento deve entregar este material à Polícia para ajudar nas investigações; Os estabelecimentos deverão preservar a dignidade e integridade da vítima, protegendo-a e acionando os órgãos de segurança pública; Em casos de constrangimento, o estabelecimento pode (e deve) retirar o ofensor e impedir o seu reingresso até o término das atividades.

    "text": "[Energy Management Network](/c/emn)»\n[Energy Efficiency Group](/c/ee)\nIn partnership with AESP: The increasing roles of DERs, connected technology and Big Data are driving rapid change in energy efficiency. As we shape the Utility of the future, this community will help you keep up with the latest developments.\nPost\nHeat Pump Assisted Water Heater Technology Could Make Big Lift\nNew Technology Lowers Prices for Food Service Operations to Electrify\nReliable hot water is critical for restaurants for preparing food and washing dishes and equipment, as well as hand washing. However, water heating is one of the biggest energy users in restaurants. Heating water for restaurant use accounts for 16 percent of all commercial gas usage in California[[1]](#_ftn1). Food service buildings are among the highest intensive energy users on a per-square-foot basis, largely because of their hot water usage. Foodservice operations may soon feel the pressure to electrify. The California Air Resources Board is analyzing proposed zero-emission GHG standards for new space and water heaters. It is currently planned for consideration in 2025 with any implementation beginning in 2030, and would only be applicable to the purchase of new equipment.\nDoing so will be difficult, particularly for existing restaurants. Many food service operations, especially small and independent businesses, do not have the space for the size of a storage tank that would be required for a heat pump water heater. Restaurants in California, as with most states, are legally required to have sufficient hot water to meet all these demands under peak conditions.\nIn response to these challenges, an emerging technology, the heat pump-assisted water heater, is gaining traction. It is designed to meet this existing gap between what the market needs and the cost and challenges of installing available heat pump water heaters. It is geared to meet the needs of existing food service businesses that want to be able to transition to a heat pump while still retaining the benefits of their current water heating system.\nWith funding from CalNEXT – California’s statewide emerging technology initiative – the TRC Advanced Energy team recently published a report, “Market Potential for Heat Pump Assisted Hot Water Systems in Foodservice Facilities.” This report, which TRC Advanced Energy developed with research support from Frontier Energy and Energy Solutions, assesses the benefits and challenges of adopting heat pump-assisted water heater technology for a range of food service establishments.\n“Heat pump-assisted water heaters are a solution that we have available today,” said Amin Delagah, Associate Director of Research and Consulting for TRC Advanced Energy, an environmental services provider. “Heat pump water heater adoption rates in restaurants are still very low due to a lack of familiarity, space and electrical capacity requirements and primarily, the health department water heater sizing regulatory barrier, but the heat pump assist concept is a solution that we can move forward today to overcome these barriers.”\nThe heat pump-assisted water heater, as its name suggests, is designed to operate in series with an existing water heater, which makes it attractive for restaurants that do not want to overhaul their current system completely. During down times for the business, the existing heater would maintain the recirculation temperature of already heated water in its system. During off hours, the heat pump-assisted water heater would produce sufficient hot water to restock the system. Because the existing heater is already large enough to meet food service needs during business hours, the heat pump-assisted water heater system can be built to fit the available space, even if it is undersized.\nThe benefits of using a heat pump-assisted water heater are similar to those of a heat pump: improved energy efficiency and possibly lower long-term energy costs, although cost issues largely depend on the type of system being replaced. Natural gas fuel, which is used by 90 percent of food service operations for water heating, is currently cheaper than electricity in most of California.\nHeat pump systems also provide cooling as a byproduct, which could be useful to counteract kitchen heat.\nHeat pump-assisted water heaters are designed to address the big disadvantage of heat pump water heaters for restaurants – the longer time needed to heat the water from cold. One workaround is a much larger tank, but floor space is typically at a premium in restaurants, making this workaround unappealing for many food service operations. For a heat pump water heater to meet health department requirements, it would need a much bigger tank than its gas-fired counterpart (because the gas-fired water heater can heat water faster).\nHeat pump-assisted water heaters may also be cheaper to install than a conventional, retrofitted heat pump water heater system, and the heat pump-assisted water heater does not need to meet these sizing regulations because the legacy water heater still functions as a backup system. At this point, the technology is still emerging and has not been installed commercially, but the authors estimate that initial costs for the heat pump water heater that acts as the assist, including installation, could range between $6,000 to $20,000. This amount, while significant, is still much cheaper than what it could cost a full-service restaurant to install a heat pump water heater capable of meeting water demands, which could well exceed $100,000.\n“The costs for heat pump assisted heat pumps are largely driven by the electrical work and the space required, and there may be incentives available to offset these,” Delagah said.\nAnother benefit is that because the heat pump-assisted water heater is a backup system, it does not require health department approval, making the process simpler. Both heat pump water heaters and heat pump-assisted water heaters also have the additional operational benefit of being able to benefit from time-of-use rates and the additional cooling they could provide for kitchens.\n“This year in October, it was 95 degrees in the Bay Area,” Delagah said. “There are new California OSHA[[1]](#_ftn1) rules on the books for indoor temperatures – if your facilities are over an 82°F temperature indoors, you have to provide cooling centers for employees. That’s becoming an emerging concern for restaurants to meet a new heat illness standard.”\nOn the downside, the higher upfront costs will likely still be a significant barrier to the adoption of heat pump-assisted water heaters, even if they are relatively less expensive than heat pump water heaters.\nOne big hurdle is that health departments, by and large, are not familiar with the technology – and may be more resistant to its approval. The relatively high price of electricity in California, compared with gas, may be another barrier. Yet regulations and the need to decarbonize are moving closer, with California’s 2030 deadlines for reducing its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent, in comparison with 1990 levels. Restaurants are well positioned to be the public face of doing their part.\n“This is great equipment for restaurants that are thinking about positioning themselves for where things are going in terms of air quality regulations,” Delagah said. “If you’re a chain restaurant, you should probably be trying this out, kicking the tires a bit, and preparing for what your solution is going to be when there is a mandate.”\n1. This statistic comes from earlier research conducted by the same author, “Energy Efficiency Potential of Gas-Fired Commercial Water Heating Equipment in Foodservice Facilities” (Delagah and Fisher 2009),\n2.
