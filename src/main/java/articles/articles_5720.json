    "text": "FARMINGTON — The two women found dead at their business on Red Schoolhouse Road earlier in the week were remembered Friday as valued members of the Farmington community who sought to help others in times of need.\nAllison Joy Cumming, the 53-year-old owner of Pawsitive Dog Kennel, had in recent years started a Facebook community to help those who were suffering due to the various complications of the COVID pandemic. As an Army veteran, she also helped others who had been in the service.\n“She was the kindest, sweetest person you could ever know,” said one friend. “She loved her country, she loved her community, she loved her friends and she loved her dogs.”\nCumming and her mother, 76-year-old Jean Robinson, were\nfound dead Wednesday at the business. Maine State Police were investigating but have not disclosed how the pair died.\nDozens of people Friday took to social media to share their memories about the women. Many of them were dog owners who frequently housed their pets at Cumming’s business. Others knew Cumming through her Farmington NEEDS group, established during the early part of the pandemic.\n“.. so many of us are so heart broken,” wrote one member of the Facebook group. “We loved both Joy and her mom Jean, who was also an amazing, kind, incredible friend and part of our Farmington dog group for many years. So many hearts will need to heal and I hope we get some answers soon. They deserve that.”\nThe women were discovered dead at 274 Red School House Road on Wednesday morning. State police, along with Farmington Police and the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office, have been investigating since.\nOnce the deaths became publicly known, dog owners began asking police for help getting their dogs out of the kennel. There were no indications that any of the animals were harmed. Cumming’s personal dogs were taken to the Franklin County Animal Shelter, although friends were working to get those dogs placed in a home later Friday.\nThe two women were well-known and popular in the area, in part because of the dog kennel and in part because of the way they engaged with the community and tried to help where they could.\n“This is a tragedy,” wrote another woman, on the Facebook page. “Joy’s mother, Jean, was my close friend — people often joked we were made from the same stardust. Her zest for life and to find the best in every moment and to live every moment were gifts. We had several adventures together that I will always remember. Joy had a giving kind soul.”\nMany of those who commented about the tragedy asked for anonymity. They wanted it this way, they said, because Cumming and her mother were private people. They liked to keep things intimate and confined to their own community.\nCumming started the Facebook NEEDS group to help people who needed various things while the pandemic was grinding on. Through the group, local people could share information on where and how to get things like baby clothes, food items or whatever was needed at the moment.\nThose looking to sell things through the group were quickly removed. Cumming, her friends said, was not looking to profit. She was looking to help.\nAfter the pandemic wound down, the group remained a place for people in need to ask for clothes, for rides, for information on housing — whatever situation they were in, the Facebook community was there to help.\n“She was just wonderful to this community,” one friend said.\nRobinson had recently moved to 274 Red Schoolhouse Road to live in a separate residence near her daughter, according to a family friend.\n“They were loving people,” the woman said, “and they were good to each other.”\nWhile police haven’t disclosed the manner in which the two women died, they did stress that there is no threat to the public. That was little consolation for those who were missing Cumming and Robinson on Friday.\n“It just isn’t fair,” said a woman who frequently housed her dog with Cumming’s kennel. “And everybody that knew her and or her mom is all saying the same thing — they’re feeling that same heartbreak.”\nAlso on Friday, local woman Carolyn Fast organized a fundraiser to raise money for the two women’s burial expenses.\n“Our community suffered a tremendous loss with the passing of Joy Cumming and her mother, Jean Robinson,” Fast\nwrote on the GoFundMe page. “Joy made a difference in the lives of many, both human and canine, and now is our turn to help her family with burial and memorial costs. As most of you know, Joy was a tremendously giving and spiritual person. She overcame so many obstacles in her life and emerged an inspiration to us all. She was an artist in every sense of the word.”\nThe fundraiser can be found at\ngofundme.com/f/joy-cumming. Central Maine arrest log: Dec. 22-29",

    "text": "Índice Índice O que se esconde atrás dos vídeos que divertem 90 mil seguidores no Instagram ? “Uma pessoa normal”, responde António Leal e Silva, 60 anos, com o gatilho sempre rápido. “Bem-disposto, alegre, de bem com a vida”, concede, antes de confessar: “Sei lá, não estou muito habituado a falar de mim próprio.” Essa mesma confissão repetir-se-ia muitas vezes ao longo de quase duas horas de conversa com o Observador, que confirmaram categoricamente, pelo menos nesta instância, o fator boa-disposição.\nNada faria prever que os vídeos que grava com o smartphone em riste, apontado para o ecrã da televisão, o fariam chegar a tanta gente. “Não estava à espera, porque o que faço, no fundo, acaba por ser uma crítica. Podia não ser bem recebido”. Sem pretensões e de língua afiada, começou a partilhar nas redes sociais comentários de moda sobre os looks dos famosos com que se deparava no televisor. “Com o tempo, cheguei à conclusão de que não vou mudar o mundo e que o melhor é levar as coisas a brincar”, explica. “As pessoas dizem-me que riem imenso comigo.” O tom suavizou, o sentido de humor ganhou protagonismo.\nDe Ibiza a Monte Carlo, frequentou as festas “mais fabulosas do mundo”. Foi relações públicas de “praticamente todas as discotecas de Lisboa” e arredores, do Kremlin ao Plateau, com um pezinho no T Clube, na Quinta do Lago. “Houve uma altura que não havia festa em que não estivesse presente.” Trabalhou com Ana Salazar e chegou a lançar uma coleção de moda. Foi comentador na SIC, na TVI e na CMTV. “Nunca me faltou nada e sempre fiz o que queria, fui muito mimado. Não me posso queixar e agradeço todos os dias a Deus pela vida que tive, que tenho, e que espero continuar a ter.”\nEste artigo é exclusivo para os nossos assinantes: assine agora e beneficie de leitura ilimitada e outras vantagens.

    "text": "Microsoft is laying off a further 650 employees from its gaming division, according to a memo sent by Phil Spencer yesterday (12 September). This follows several previous rounds of layoffs to affect the tech giant.\nMicrosoft Gaming CEO Spencer said the job cuts will mostly affect corporate and supporting staff in the division.\n“As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming – mostly corporate and supporting functions – to organise our business for long-term success,” said Spencer.\nSpencer said that no games or devices will be cancelled because of these cuts and no studios are being closed as part of these layoffs. However, he said there would be “some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games”.\nSiliconRepublic.com reached out to Microsoft Ireland for comment.\nGaming industry suffers layoffs Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard in a $68.7bn deal last October. The acquisition followed a lengthy investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to decide whether the deal between these two major gaming companies would harm competition in the sector. After the tech giant made some concessions to the authority, the CMA found that the new deal will stop Microsoft from “locking up” competition in cloud gaming and preserve competitive prices and services for UK cloud gamers.\nFollowing the acquisition, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees at Blizzard and Xbox and Blizzard’s president resigned. At the time, Spencer said the layoffs came as a result of “aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business”. In May, it was revealed that the company is working on further cost-cutting efforts in its gaming division .\nElsewhere, the gaming industry has seen big layoffs.\nIn February, Sony Interactive Entertainment laid off roughly 900 staff from its global PlayStation workforce. And in April, Take-Two Interactive Software, the Rockstar Games parent company, revealed plans to fire around 5pc of its workforce and scrap several titles in development.\nDon’t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

According to Anadolu, the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) found that Micbel al-Shuveyhi, code-named “Abu Yakin al-Iraqi,” and Muhammed Hilaf Ibrahim Ibrahim, code-named “Abu Leys,” the intelligence officer for Turkey’s ISIL network, were plotting attacks on synagogues and churches in Turkey, while Iyheb Elani, code-named “Abdullah al-Jumaili,” was readying attacks on the Iraqi Embassy in Ankara. The three suspects and 29 others connected to them were captured in an operation carried out jointly by MİT and the police, according to a statement from Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya on X. The detentions took place across nine provinces as part of an İstanbul-based operation, the minister said.

    "text": "I’m a Financial Advisor: Here’s How I Broke My Own Bad Money Habits\nIt’s not uncommon for people to think they might have the worst money habits ever, but the first step in breaking them is acknowledgment and\naiming to improve. And don’t worry too much about past mistakes you’ve made!\nChances are if you are looking to get on the right track, you’ll be working with a financial advisor — possibly one who has been there, done that, and broken free of the cycle.\nGOBankingRates spoke with James M. Comblo, president of\nFSC Wealth Advisors, and Jenny Whichello, money coach at Bliss + Wealth, to talk about their worst money habits and the changes they made to reverse these behaviors. Here’s how two financial advisors were able to break their bad money habits.\nScarcity Mindset\nGrowing up, every decision in Comblo’s life was dictated by money. His family had very little means and money ruled the food they ate, the doctors they saw and the sports he played. So, having a scarcity mindset was the bad habit which stuck with him.\n“The fear was always we couldn’t afford it or we wouldn’t have enough if we did that,” said Comblo.\nAs Comblo started to settle into his adult life and become more financially successful, he maintained the scarcity mindset. What if he lost his job? What if he had an emergency? The “what ifs” resulted in stockpiling money into bank and investment accounts without enjoying any of his earnings.\nWhen someone close to Comblo passed away at age 58, he changed his mindset. He allowed himself and his family to enjoy their money using\nreverse budgeting. This is where you save the money you want first. Then, you can spend the rest of it guilt-free.\n“Healthy relationships with money include enjoying some of the money as you earn it,” said Comblo. “The point is not to watch the money grow somewhere in an account. It’s about what money can do for you and how it can help you enjoy your life today while also saving for later.”\nAvoiding Finances\nIn her twenties, Whichello said her biggest, unhelpful habit was avoiding her finances. “I would destroy my bank and credit card statements without opening the envelopes. I had an ‘ignorance is bliss’ mentality around money,” Whichello said.\nThis mentality resulted in several adverse effects including maxing out credit cards, overdrafting bank accounts and dipping into savings to cover living expenses.\nTo stop the cycle, Whichello said she needed to get to the root cause of why she avoided her finances. For several months, she reflected on her relationship with money and uncovered some of her core beliefs about it.\nOne core belief she had was that money is stressful. Avoiding money is the best way to minimize the pain. Whichello said this belief originated from watching her mother at the kitchen table paying the monthly bills. This was her mother’s most stressful, dreaded activity.\nOnce she understood this core belief — money was stressful, therefore she avoided managing her finances — Whichello said she looked for evidence to the contrary.\nShe was then able to retrain herself to adopt a new belief: I am fully capable of managing my money and having a blissful relationship with it.\n“I coupled reviewing my finances with a treat. For me, that was a pedicure. This trained my mind to look forward to the activity, instead of dreading it,” said Whichello.\nMore From GOBankingRates",
