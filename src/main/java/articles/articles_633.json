    "title": "Fact check: Trump falsely claims Democratic states are passing laws allowing people to execute babies after birth - NORTHEAST - NEWS CHANNEL NEBRASKA",
    "text": "Fact check: Trump falsely claims Democratic states are passing laws allowing people to execute babies after birth By Daniel Dale, CNN Washington (CNN) — Former President Donald Trump continues to try to depict Democrats as the “ [true radicals](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4215291-trump-urges-supporters-in-iowa-to-back-abortion-ban-exceptions/)” on abortion policy. To make his case, though, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has made wildly inaccurate claims. In a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump said, “Hard to believe, they have some states passing legislation where you can execute the baby after birth. It’s crazy.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. No state has passed or is passing a law that allows the execution of a baby after it is born. Killing a person after birth is [illegal in every state](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/jul/21/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-false-claim-that-some-states-allow-po/). “Every state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,” [Mary Ziegler](https://law.ucdavis.edu/people/mary-ziegler), a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said Thursday. “There is no basis for this claim,” [Kimberly Mutcherson](https://law.rutgers.edu/directory/view/mutchers), a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Thursday. The Trump campaign did not respond to a CNN request to specify which states Trump was talking about. Mutcherson said: “The falsity of the claim can be seen in the fact that Trump never identifies such a state.” There was at least one instance, in an interview with NBC last year, in which Trump specified that he was making the claim about the state of New York in addition to unspecified “other places.” But he was [wrong then, too](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/17/politics/fact-check-donald-trump?cid=ios_app): New York did not pass a law allowing babies to be killed after birth, though [false social media posts](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N30F16K/) claimed it had. Similar false claims have circulated about California. Some of those claims were based on criticism of vague language in an early version of a Democratic state legislator’s 2022 [bill](https://a14.asmdc.org/press-releases/20220927-asm-wicks-reproductive-health-advocates-celebrate-signing-ab-2223) that was intended to protect people from being prosecuted over miscarriages, stillbirths and self-managed abortions. But the vague language was [revised](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N37Z2H5/) before the bill was signed into law. Months before passage, a Democratic-led legislative committee [acknowledged](https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/202120220AB2223_Assembly-Judiciary.pdf) that the early text’s vague use of the phrase “ [perinatal death](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/137/5/e20160551/52158/Standard-Terminology-for-Fetal-Infant-and?autologincheck=redirected)” might have inadvertently left open the interpretation that the bill would immunize people from punishment in all cases in which their baby died in the first days of its life, even in cases where the death was caused by acts after the baby was born. The final bill that was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom [clarified](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2223&showamends=false) that the “perinatal death” immunity is specifically for “perinatal death due to causes that occurred in utero.” In other words, there is no basis for a claim that California passed a law legalizing post-birth executions. A repeated false claim about legal scholars Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country. During his current presidential campaign, he has repeatedly made the [false claim](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/politics/fact-check-trump-abortion-roe-overturned-legal-scholars/index.html) that all legal scholars had wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and power over abortion policy returned to individual states. Trump said it again in the Fox News interview: “I say, let the states decide. This is — every legal scholar wanted this to be where abortion should be.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that “every legal scholar” wanted Roe overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to the states is not even close to true. Many legal scholars wanted Roe preserved, as several of them reiterated in April comments to CNN. “Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,” Mutcherson, who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. “Donald Trump’s claim is flatly incorrect,” [Maya Manian](https://www.wcl.american.edu/community/faculty/profile/mmanian/bio/), an American University law professor who also did not want Roe overturned, said in April. Trump’s claim is “obviously not” true, said Ziegler, another scholar who did not want Roe overturned. She said in April: “Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn’t want to overturn Roe. … It wasn’t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.” You can read a more detailed fact check of this claim [here](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/politics/fact-check-trump-abortion-roe-overturned-legal-scholars/index.html).

Instead of exploring alternative options, the owner's son made the drastic decision to surrender her to a high-kill shelter, even requesting euthanasia for this healthy young dog. When she arrived at the shelter, Mila was in a severely neglected state, with her coat so matted that it required complete shaving.\n[ · Followuser · 4.5K followers](/m/alameda-post-1716088)\nAlameda Post\nA Reunion in Lincoln Park 102 Years Later\nIn 1922, a group of immigrant German sisters gathered their children and picnic baskets and hopped on the streetcar at East 14th Street and 71st Avenue in Oakland.

He’s the 19th century version of the guy yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off his lawn, the meanie who won’t give their ball back once it lands in his yard. But he’s also, next to the person on whom the entire season is based, someone who represents one of the most important tenets of our humanity— the understanding that we are responsible for our neighbors, and that in acting on that belief we grow and become better people . That beautiful notion is also the core value of The Foodbank Players , which makes our third annual production of the play something nearly sacred.\n[Richmond ·](/richmond-ca)16d\n[ · Followuser · 627 followers](/m/feelingvegas-1713562)\nFeelingVegas\n11 Free Activities in Las Vegas That’ll Make Christmas Unforgettable\nIs it possible to dive into the glitzy world of Las Vegas without emptying your wallet, especially at Christmas?

    "text": "Digital Media Pad prototype The healthcare landscape is constantly evolving, demanding innovative solutions to address challenges faced by patients and medical professionals alike. In this pursuit of progress, health resources and strategy leader Ela Vashishtha has emerged as a pioneer, spearheading the development of a groundbreaking invention: the Digital Medical Pad. More than just a technological innovation, this patented device embodies Ms. Vashishtha's deep understanding of healthcare complexities, honed through her vast experience managing a $3 billion portfolio and driving data-driven initiatives across 25+ hospitals in her state of residency. This expertise shines through in every facet of the Digital Medical Pad, designed to address critical issues plaguing healthcare systems, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Secure Access, Streamlined Processes At the heart of the invention lies a secure biometric scanner. Gone are the days of misplaced charts and stolen identities; fingerprints grant authorized personnel instant access to a patient's medical history, ensuring both privacy and efficient care delivery. Medication management takes a leap forward with the pad's ability to display medication history and facilitate digital order creation. This not only reduces waiting times but also minimizes errors and potential drug interactions. Real-Time Intelligence Powering Decisions The Digital Medical Pad transcends mere data storage. Embedded AI and machine learning algorithms work synergistically with real-time data to empower healthcare professionals. Imagine a scenario where a doctor, upon entering a patient's fever symptom, receives treatment suggestions tailored to the patient's unique medical profile, considering factors like co-existing conditions and potential allergies. This level of real-time decision support enhances diagnostic accuracy and optimizes treatment plans, paving the way for personalized, effective care. Bridging the Global Healthcare Divide Ms. Vashishtha's vision extends beyond borders. Recognizing the immense potential of the Digital Medical Pad in resource-limited countries, she is leading the charge in adapting the technology for these specific contexts. The device's affordability and portability make it ideal for rural areas, where access to quality healthcare has traditionally been limited. By eliminating paper records and cumbersome processes, the pad promises to revolutionize care delivery in underprivileged regions, democratizing access to crucial medical information and services. Partnerships for Progress The journey towards widespread adoption of the Digital Medical Pad is underway. Ms. Vashishtha is actively seeking partnerships with multiple entities in India, aiming to pilot the device in rural areas and smaller cities. These collaborations will serve as testaments to the pad's effectiveness and pave the way for its broader implementation across developing nations. Currently, she is partnering with and providing strategic advice on product advancement ideas, market strategies, future iterations of testing the pad in Indian healthcare market. A Beacon of Hope Ela Vashishtha's Digital Medical Pad opens the possibility of a future where healthcare is accessible, efficient, and personalized in developing and developed worlds alike. By harnessing the power of technology and focusing on real-world needs, Ms. Vashishtha is trying to forge a path towards a healthier, more equitable world. This innovation holds the potential to bridge healthcare divides, empower medical professionals, and improve the lives of millions, making it a truly transformative force in the global healthcare landscape.

    "text": "It's Women's History Month, and According to One Pastor, The Rights of Women Were Established by a Higher Power Even more surprising might be the words of the late Dr. Pieter Noomen, a psychotherapist and senior minister at three Protestant churches, who counseled those with mental health issues and helped with hospice. According to Dr. Noomen, the equality of women and men was established eons ago by \"I AM,\" the name spoken to him by an entity that others might call God, Allah, the Heavenly Father, etc. Actually, \"Heavenly Father\" wouldn't be an accurate title, because according to Dr. Noomen, \"I AM\" is not gender specific. \"Only Love can tell us who we are or are not. Her/His light is in us, as we are made from it. Our person - as every appearance - can radiate it, notwithstanding our inefficiencies,\" Dr. Noomen wrote. \"The female part in us wants our person to dazzle.\" Dr. Noomen said he had many conversations with \"I AM,\" and he wrote down much of what he was told. Although he died in 2019, Dr. Noomen left behind copious notes from those conversations, and they remain available for all on his website, www.wordsforall.org - free for anyone to peruse on their own. Whether one believes Dr. Noomen really spoke to \"I AM\" or not, the words on his website likely will pique enough interest to engage visitors to explore the myriad subjects and sections, all of which are categorized, and any individual subject can be found via the search bar. \"It is important for us to see that our highest achievement is not a show of perfect harmony in whatever love relationship. This is a branch of the tree of love; it as such can be utterly fulfilling and beautiful,\" Dr. Noomen wrote. \"Yet, if there is a pinnacle of human glory, it is that within each individual the female and male identities embrace, unite and walk in harmony.\" Dr. Noomen also said \"I AM\" told him this: \"The beauty of the ongoing love affair in every piece and particle of existence is as it were projected on the big screen of universal life. All the different societies, dimensions, shapes and densities have within them the utterly satisfying, invigorating and always embracing duality that causes the universe to be so lively and colorful. I AM is reflected in everything.\" Dr. Noomen fully understood that some of what he wrote might raise eyebrows and doubts, but he also had a sense of humor about it. This is how he explained the \"his/her\" conundrum: \"Finally, I personally was glad he (\"I AM\") addressed an issue that I know some readers of these words will find annoying. It is the use of He/She and Her/His for referring to I AM. He said I would leave behind the need for that unusual but nevertheless correct use when I die; then I would never have to use it again.\" An example of Dr. Noomen's \"Words of Wisdom,\" one of the many categories on his website: \"Our body and our mind have quite a love affair going. They never stop interacting. They couldn't even survive without each other.\" Media Contact Company Name: Ascot Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Rising comedy star Kenyi Flores died on Tuesday. He was 28.\nThe Los Angeles Medical Examiner’s Office has not yet determined the cause of death, stating that the case is still under investigation, according to officials.\nFlores’s manager Cameron Silzle didn’t immediately return a request for comment from NTD.\nFlores, born June 10, 1996, had been making waves in the Los Angeles comedy scene and quickly became a beloved figure among fellow comedians and audiences alike. His sudden death has sent shockwaves through the entertainment community.\nThe comedian’s family announced his death on his Facebook page, which boasts over 277,000 followers. “It is with great sadness that we confirm the untimely passing of our friend, brother, and son, Kenyi Flores. Please respect our privacy at this time as we are all shocked and devastated by this loss,” the statement read.\nFans and fellow comedians expressed their grief and shared memories of Flores on social media.\nOne fan, identified as Chamorrita Britty, commented on the Facebook post, recalling a recent performance she attended: “I just saw him live on tour in Portland earlier this month, January 11th. He was so proud to go from opening on a Thursday to headlining five SOLD-OUT shows during primetime, Friday through Sunday.”\nFlores had recently begun his “Butterfly Effect” tour, which began Jan. 10 in Portland, Oregon, and was scheduled to finish in San Diego on April 19. His last performance was in Norcross, Georgia.\nFellow comedian Gabriel Iglesias shared his thoughts with the Los Angeles Times, saying, “I feel honored to have spent time with Ken. Of course he was hilarious but above all he was kind, respectful and fun to be around. He will be missed.”\nComedian Jo Koy, who was on a USO tour in Japan when he heard the news, told the Los Angeles Times he was “crushed” by Flores’ passing. “I would always check on him, I truly loved this guy,” Koy said. “I literally posted about a pic of his tour schedule a couple days before he passed. It’s all so crazy.”\nFlores had recently celebrated a personal milestone, sharing on social media platform X that he had completed several tour shows without drinking alcohol. “So I started my tour a couple weeks ago and I’m proud to say I’ve done every single show, 5 in Portland 1 in Albuquerque and 4 in Atlanta without a single drop of alcohol,” he wrote.\nHe said he wasn’t sober but just wanted to take a break. “Nervous for Phoenix next weekend but I think I got it. I’m not sober just wanna chill a bit,” Flores wrote.",

    "text": "Gupta highlighted that Auto LPG, described as a 'Net Zero Hero,' generates 20% less CO2 than petrol and 60% less than diesel. The Indian Auto LPG Coalition (IAC) is urging major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Hyundai Motor India, Bajaj Auto, and Kia Motors to include Auto LPG in their vehicle lineup. This move aims to promote cleaner and more cost-effective fuel alternatives. Suyash Gupta, Director General of IAC, has reached out to the executives of these companies, emphasizing the significant advantages of Auto LPG.Gupta highlighted that Auto LPG, described as a 'Net Zero Hero,' generates 20% less CO2 than petrol and 60% less than diesel. It emits almost no particulate matter and has considerably lower NOx emissions. \\\"Auto LPG emits 20% less CO2 than petrol and 60% less than diesel, producing almost no particulate matter and significantly lower NOx emissions,\\\" Gupta emphasized, underlining the potential of Auto LPG to reduce air pollution and associated health risks.Additionally, Gupta pointed out the cost benefits, noting that Auto LPG is approximately 40% cheaper than petrol. Converting a petrol vehicle to Auto LPG incurs a cost of about INR 30,000, which is significantly lower than the INR 3-5 lakh required for electric vehicles (EVs).Gupta further elaborated, \\\"Adopting Auto LPG offers numerous advantages for OEMs, including meeting the growing demand for cleaner, economical fuel options amid rising fuel prices and environmental awareness. It provides a competitive edge and cost benefits due to lower conversion and infrastructure costs compared to EVs and CNG. Additionally, Auto LPG helps OEMs comply with India's stricter emission norms, ensuring sustainability.\\\"To underscore the underutilization of Auto LPG in India compared to other countries, Gupta shared global statistics: \\\"Auto LPG has experienced significant global growth over the last few years, with over 27 million vehicles using it and 25 million tonnes consumed annually. Leading the way are countries like Russia, South Korea, Poland, and Italy. In contrast, despite having more than 1,500 Auto LPG stations, India's consumption remains at just 0.35 million tonnes.\\\"The initiative by the IAC is part of an ongoing effort to engage with policymakers and automotive leaders. The goal is to foster a supportive environment for Auto LPG, aligning it with India’s objectives for sustainable development.",
