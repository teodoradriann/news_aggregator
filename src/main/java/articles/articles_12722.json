    "text": "Buenas noticias para Gonzalo Caballero. El diestro fue intervenido con éxito este jueves en el Hospital Vithas Madrid La Milagrosa tras la grave cogida que sufrió el pasado 15 de junio en la plaza de toros de Alba de Tormes en Salamanca. Muy a su pesar, el pasado fin de semana, el madrileño terminó la corrida con una triple factura del húmero y dos costillas rotas. Casi una semana después de la grave lesión, el ex de Victoria Federica reveló a través de sus redes que ya está en planta y que la intervención ha sido todo un éxito. \\\"La operación ha sido un éxito. Ya en planta y con los mejores cuidados de mi princesa\\\", desveló Caballero este jueves en su perfil de Instagram. Asimismo, el torero publicó una fotografía con su inseparable María, la niña que apadrina en el proyecto que investiga el Sarcoma de Ewing en el Hospital Infantil público Universitario Niño Jesús de Madrid. En una entrevista con Informalia, el diestro ya nos habló muy ilusionado de esta iniciativa. \\\"Por un lado siento mucha emoción, porque cuando empezamos este proyecto era un salto al vacío con muchos miedos, y te aseguro que nunca imaginamos la gran repercusión que ha tenido y cómo se ha involucrado la sociedad\\\", manifestó Caballero.",

    "text": "Thanh Vũ competed in the 500km annual Montane Lapland Arctic Ultra, completing the race on March 13 in Sweden. Photos courtesy of Thanh Vũ\n The event offered four distance categories of 20km, 50km, 185km, and the toughest, 500km. Vũ was among just 19 participants at the start line for the 500km category. She successfully crossed the finish line more than nine days later.\n\"Like many ultras, Montane Lapland Arctic Ultra (MLAU) is an emotional roller coaster. The stark difference between the days and nights, sunshine and no sunshine, means you can be singing and loving it in the forest but once the disorienting darkness descends, you're in the abyss, struggling to put one foot in front of the other,\" Vũ posted on Facebook after completing the competition.\n\"There were many moments when I was worried if I would ever see the finish line. MLAU is very different in the sense that the checkpoints can be 39-77km apart, which make timing for water, sleep and small rests very difficult.\n\"All things considered, the weather during the later days of the race was extremely cooperative which made the course much more runnable and I was able to push hard for some mileage gains.\n\"The race is so extremely difficult. But even when it was really tough and I felt depleted, what made it enjoyable was the loveliest crew of volunteers and staff at check points. They become a lovely physical and mental refuge where I could piece myself back together.\"\nStarting on March 3 in Overkalix, participants could run, cycle or sky their chosen distance.\nThanh Vũ completed her race on foot on the night of March 13, covering 503.1km of trail in 9 days, 9 hours and 18 minutes. Her moving time was 7 days 19.31 hours with a total rest time of 1 day, 13.47 hours, and an average speed of 3.2km/h.\nShe placed No 15, while the winner was German Florian Reiterberger who competed with a fat bike and wrapped up his race on March 8. Four racers of this tough class did not finish the course.\nThanh Vũ, 34, earned many people's respect when she took top place in the triathlon Swiss Ultra 2022, where she swam 38km, cycled 1,800km and ran 422km in 328hr 27.55min.\nPreviously, she was the first Asian woman to complete the 4 Desert Grand Slam of 250km Namibia, 250km Gobi March, 250km Atacama Crossing and The Last Desert of 250km in the Antarctic.\nShe also took part in other ultramarathons such as running 522km through Australian desert in 2017, 230km in the Arctic in 2018, and 273km at the Grand Canyon in Arizona in 2018.\n“I always set the goal of becoming the most resilient Vietnamese person in the world. When I conquer new milestones and return to everyday life, I want to be a better version of myself, so life will be meaningful,\" Vũ said during an event in 2022. \"When I push myself, I feel more valuable to myself and those around me. I also want to inspire people, so that everyone can find challenges and overcome them.\" VNS",

    "title": "Así puedes llegar a Valencia en el puente de Todos los Santos desde Madrid después de la DANA",
    "text": "Las fuertes lluvias torrenciales provocadas por la DANA han causado estragos en Valencia y en otras regiones, como Andalucía, Castilla La Mancha o Cataluña. El Gobierno tiene previsto aprobar el próximo martes la declaración de zona catastrófica en las áreas afectadas en el Consejo de Ministros y tres días de luto por los más de 200 fallecidos contabilizados hasta ahora. Muchas infraestructuras ferroviarias y carreteras han quedado gravemente afectadas por las fuertes lluvias. Respecto al transporte ferroviario, el ministro de Transportes y Movilidad Sostenible, Óscar Puente, afirmó durante una rueda de prensa que la línea de alta velocidad entre Madrid y Valencia permanecerá cerrada para su reparación durante al menos 15 días, si bien se podría alargar este periodo hasta las tres semanas. Puente también ha señalado este viernes en una entrevista en RNE que existen 80 kilómetros afectados en carreteras de titularidad del Estado en la provincia de Valencia. El ministerio ha habilitado 25 millones en las últimas 24 horas con el objetivo de empezar a reconstruir las carreteras más gravemente dañadas por la DANA en la A-7, la N-330 y la N-322. De ellos, se han habilitado de emergencia 12,6 millones para reconstruir el viaducto \\\"colapsado\\\" de la A-7, ubicado en el municipio de Quart de Poblet, y construir un desvío provisional de tres carriles junto a la propia autovía. \\\"Los daños son tan graves que tenemos la A7 en este momento cortada e imposible de transitar por ella\\\", ha detallado. La suspensión de servicios ferroviarios y la incomunicación por distintos puntos del mapa en la Comunidad Valenciana debido a los destrozos ha coincidido con el puente de Todos los Santos, un momento en el que personas de todo el país se mueven hacia otras regiones bien para disfrutar de unos días con su familia y amigos, bien para descansar y hacer turismo. Sin embargo, la alerta todavía permanece activada, por lo que tanto los servicios de emergencias como los de movilidad desaconsejan los desplazamientos que no sean estrictamente indispensables. Si este es tu caso y necesitas llegar a Valencia desde Madrid, todavía quedan opciones. En este momento, y tras las palabras del ministro de Transportes, llegar a Valencia solo es posible en autobús, por avión o en coche, aunque existen ciertas limitaciones en este último caso por el impacto del agua en algunas carreteras. La mejor opción es tomar el autobús de Avanza, la compañía que opera esta línea. En su web y en sus redes sociales han avisado de la reanudación del servicio entre la capital y el Levante con una ruta alternativa por Albacete, aunque hay que tener en cuenta que el tiempo de recorrido podría verse incrementado por este motivo. Por su parte, Alsa mantiene suspendidos los servicios con origen-destino Valencia y alrededores hasta que la situación se normalice. Otra manera es llegar por carretera. Es posible ir hasta Alicante en tren (solo está suspendido el trayecto en alta velocidad) y desde allí seguir en coche por la AP7 hasta enlazar en el entorno de Silla con la V31, una de las circunvalaciones de Valencia. Los servicios de carreteras están habilitando las circunvalaciones de la ciudad, las V30 y V31, como alternativa a la A7 por la acumulación de daños en ella. La V30 está abierta en ambos sentidos y en la V31 esta mañana se han abierto dos carriles, uno por sentido. Si optas por este medio de transporte, existen limitaciones muy severas en el tráfico, especialmente en la A7 por el colapso de un puente cerca del cruce con la A3, un punto crítico porque está en la circunvalación de Valencia y por el volumen de tráfico (unos 100.000 vehículos al día). La red de alta velocidad ferroviaria entre Madrid y Valencia no está operativa porque hay dos túneles muy afectados por las lluvias (el de Chiva y el de Torrent) y no estará en funcionamiento al menos en las 2 o 3 próximas semanas, según ha explicado el ministro. \\\"No les puedo decir hasta donde llega el daño en infraestructuras\\\", ha admitido Puente, aunque ha confiado en que \\\"los daños no sean muy graves\\\" porque se trata de una vía de hormigón. Preguntado sobre si existe alguna alternativa a esta vía, el ministro ha afirmado que la única posibilidad sería por la vía de Albacete, pero que esta también está afectada. La última manera es por aire. Desde Aena insisten en que los viajeros deben contactar con las aerolíneas para comprobar el estado de sus vuelos y consultar el estado de las carreteras en fuentes oficiales para llegar hasta los aeropuertos pertinentes. Transit Valencia -la cuenta oficial del Centro de Gestión del Tráfico del Ayuntamiento de Valencia- ha detallado que la carretera A3 hasta su llegada al aeropuerto ya está operativa. El aeropuerto de Valencia ha permanecido operativo en todo momento y tiene previstos entre este jueves y el domingo 878 vuelos: 219 vuelos para hoy; 234 para el viernes, día 1 de noviembre; 194 más para el sábado y 231 para el domingo. A nivel general, se desviaron 30 vuelos y otros 49 se cancelaron y el miércoles la operativa ya fue la habitual, aunque los problemas estaban en el acceso al aeropuerto, debido a los daños en las carreteras.",

    "title": "Delhi Now Has The Third Biggest Fleet Of E-Buses In The World",
    "text": "Taking a major step towards sustainable mobility, Delhi has added 350 more electric buses to its fleet. With this, the total number of electric buses plying on the roads of the national capital has gone up to 1650. Delhi Lt Governor V K Saxena, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot flagged off the 350 electric buses on Wednesday. Jump To Third biggest fleet of electric buses Minister Gahlot said that the national capital now has the 3rd largest such fleet in the world, only after Chinese cities and Santiago. The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) had launched its first electric bus service in January 2022 between IP Depot and Pragati Maidan. Since then DTC has added hundreds of electric buses to its fleet. Delhi to phase out CNG buses In January 2023, the Delhi government had ordered 2,026 electric buses to be added to its fleet by December 2025. The Delhi Government had also unveiled a plan to have the second largest fleet of electric buses in the world by the end of 2025. According to the Delhi Government by 2025, over 10,000 buses will ply on Delhi's roads and 80 per cent of them will be electric-powered. Why Delhi need more electric buses By adding more electric buses and phasing out the CNG ones, the Delhi government is hoping to cut 4.67 lakh tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. Vehicular emissions are one of the major components of air pollution in Delhi. Though CNG buses are not as polluting as diesel-powered ones, they still emit polluting gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides besides Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 and ultrafine particles. A 2022 study by researchers at Kyushu University in Japan had said that if CNG buses are replaced with e-buses, around 74.67 percent of the total pollutant emissions from the existing bus fleet in Delhi could be reduced.

    "text": "Basketball legends and fans gathered in Zagreb to honor the late Drazen Petrovic, with Team Drazen securing a 110-107 victory over the Croatian national team in a special exhibition game. Basketball stars paid tribute to the legendary Drazen Petrovic in a special Legacy Game held in Zagreb, Croatia, marking what would have been his 60th birthday. More than 15,000 fans gathered to honor Petrovic's memory. The exhibition game featured a matchup between the Croatian national team and 'Team Drazen,' coached by Zeljko Obradovic and Neven Spahija. In a thrilling finish, 'Team Drazen' secured a narrow 110-107 victory, with Dzanan Musa delivering a decisive dunk in the final 20 seconds. Mario Hezonja attempted to tie the game with a three-pointer, but his long-range shot missed the mark. [Mario Hezonja](/players/9225-mario-hezonja.html) |Team:|| | Real Madrid forward finished the match with 36 points, also winning the three-point contest during halftime. Players for 'Team Drazen' included EuroLeague stars like Walter Tavares, Shane Larkin, Dzanan Musa, Mathias Lessort, Vanja Marinkovic, Dyshawn Pierre, Tornike Shengelia, Andreas Obst, and NBA big Boban Marjanovic. The Croatian team featured talents like Mario Hezonja and Roko Prkacin. Luka Doncic and Goran Dragic were in attendance, having also taken part in another tribute game in Ljubljana, 'I Feel Slovenia Night of the Dragon,' in August.

    "title": "Water Supply: Water Crisis in Hubballi and Dharwad Twin Cities | - Times of India",
    "text": "Hubballi: As the mercury level rises and the heat waves persist, residents of the twin cities, Hubballi and Dharwad, are grappling with worsening drinking water shortages. Recent protests in some areas of Hubballi City reflect growing frustration with authorities and service providers like L&T, responsible for water supply.Presently, the Malaprabha reservoir holds 4.67 TMC of live storage, providing a potential two-month reprieve. However, prolonged rain delays and unchecked water waste could worsen the situation. The twin cities rely on a daily supply of 245 MLD, sourced primarily from the Malaprabha reservoir (220 MLD) and Neerasagar (20 MLD). Neerasagar's water serves 22 wards in the Old Hubballi area.E Thimmappa, superintending engineer, KUIDFC and also HDMC, said that currently, there is sufficient water available at Malaprabha Reservoir. To supply of water for Hubballi-Dharwad for the next two months, there is a requirement of 0.5 TMC water. Currently, there is live storage of enough water available in the reservoir. “If rain is delayed even after two months, we will have to worry about water scarcity,” he said. He also said that before the situation gets worse, people should start using water carefully, without wasting it. Many people use water to wash vehicles. If people join hands with the authorities, then Hubballi-Dharwad will be able to have a water supply uninterruptedly.Ramesh S, a social activist, said that the civic authorities should take appropriate measures to avoid a water crisis. People should also stop using water for washing vehicles, gardening etc. “The authorities should be prepared with alternative arrangements,” he added.Sources in HDMC said its officers have discussed with the officials of HDMC, KUIDFC, L&T and others regarding the availability of water in reservoirs and other issues related to water supply.The L&T, which takes care of the water supply in twin cities, also chalks out the strategies to supply water in the areas of 24/7 water zones. The L&T officials are working out plans to provide service uninterruptedly. For a smooth supply of water in 24X7 water zones, the officials plan not to keep the pipelines empty. If once the 24X7 pipeline dried then the whole water supply system may get affected, added sources.

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Bills shake off Steelers, Mother Nature for win, playoff date with Chiefs ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. – Early on in Monday’s AFC wild-card playoff game, it looked like the [Buffalo Bills](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/team-page/buffalo-bills/296) would do a cakewalk over the underdog [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/team-page/pittsburgh-steelers/298). Before a joyous crowd literally sitting on snowbanks in the stands at Highmark Stadium, the Bills made it look easy in a 31-17 victory in a game that was rescheduled from its original Sunday time slot due to a weekend snow storm in Buffalo. The win was the Bills’ fourth consecutive wild-card victory, setting them up for a divisional round matchup against the [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/team-page/kansas-city-chiefs/321) on Sunday night in Buffalo. Monday’s wild-card game started with a Bills touchdown on their first possession that came on a 10-play, 80-yard drive where the only third down was a one-yard sneak by quarterback [Josh Allen](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/josh-allen-310023/310023). Another happened on a one-play drive on their third possession, a touchdown throw to rookie [Dalton Kincaid](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/dalton-kincaid/985644) that followed an uncharacteristic Steelers turnover on the Pittsburgh 29-yard line. Another touchdown came on the Bills’ fifth possession to make it 21-0, this one capped by a spectacular 52-yard run by Allen on a drive that began on their own 20-yard line. The Steelers had turned the ball over for the second time in the first quarter on an interception in the end zone by Bills cornerback [Kaiir Elam](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/kaiir-elam/868790). Meanwhile, the Steelers were being blanketed by the Buffalo defence, with their first six possessions of the game going like this: punt, punt, fumble, punt, interception, punt. But football is often a game of attrition and Monday night was a great example of this. After being ravaged by injuries on defence for a period early this season, the Bills entered their final game the regular season a week ago as healthy as they’d been in months. But in their 21-14 win over the Miami Dolphins last Sunday, the Bills lost both starting corner [Rasul Douglas](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/rasul-douglas/257525) and linebacker [Tyrel Dodson](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/tyrel-dodson/354783) and neither was a go to face the Steelers on Monday. So when the Bills lost another starting corner in [Christian Benford](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/christian-benford-868976/868976) and linebacker Baylin Spector (who was subbing for the injured Dodson) during Monday’s first half, and then starting linebacker [Terrel Bernard](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/terrel-bernard/868880) and slot corner [Taron Johnson](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/taron-johnson/310139) after halftime, the Steelers were suddenly facing a much easier challenge on offence. Pittsburgh had scored its only touchdown of the first half – a 10-yard catch by [Diontae Johnson](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/diontae-johnson-353832/353832) –late in the second quarter after a blocked field goal ricocheted into Buffalo territory. This put them on a short field, which they cashed in on a five-play drive beginning on the Bills’ 38-yard line to make it 21-7. So when Buffalo went three-and-out to open the second half, the door was opened for the Steelers to mount a comeback. But offensive football isn’t just about scoring points. It’s also about protecting leads and trying to shorten the game. And that became especially critical for the Bills with their depleted defence, as they used up nearly half a quarter of football on their third quarter field-goal drive. The defence did its part shortening the game as well by forcing the Steelers to earn their way down the field and avoiding giving up the big play. The weakened Buffalo defence then forced Pittsburgh to go 12 plays over six minutes for their only touchdown of the second half to make it 24-17 before the Bills slammed the door shut with a four-and-out that essentially ended the game. The entire second half had just eight possessions. For the second week in a row, the Bills had some unlikely heroes. Linebacker [A.J. Klein](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/player/aj-klein/8175), who came in for Spector, had joined the Bills on Wednesday, coming off his couch after cancelling a family vacation to the Florida Keys so the 32-year-old could re-join the Bills. Elam, who made the key interception in the end zone, was the Bills’ first-round pick in 2022 but had been either injured or a healthy scratch for much of this season. It all added-up to the Bills’ sixth consecutive win since losing to the [Denver Broncos](https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/team-page/denver-broncos/314) at home on Monday Night Football, back on Nov 13, to drop to 6-6. After that game, Allan said that playing win-or-die football for the final six weeks of the regular season hadn’t been easy. And that getting to the playoffs and playing a team with the same circumstances was a bit of relief. The Chiefs were under no such pressure when Buffalo took them down 20-17 at Arrowhead Stadium back on Dec 10. At that time, a Kansas City at Buffalo AFC playoff game seemed like a huge longshot. But these Bills have earned their way to the match they wanted, in the place they wanted it to be played. And suddenly, they find themselves just two wins away from the Super Bowl.",
