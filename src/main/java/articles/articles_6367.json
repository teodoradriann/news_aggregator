    "text": "Kendrapara: Despite a fishing ban, turtles continue to die intermittently at Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary (GMS), world’s largest nesting beach for rare Olive Ridley sea turtles, according to a recent report. The reasons are many, as the globally renowned Gahirmatha has reported the deaths of 197 Olive Ridley turtles in the past four months, according to the latest report by the forest department. The carcasses have been found buried in the sand, though environmentalists fear the actual number of deaths could be much higher. Dead turtles have also been found scattered along the coastline. Despite strict restrictions in the protected zone, illegal incursions by fishing boats and trawlers persist. Authorities have taken action, confiscating 30 boats and arresting 247 fishermen in the past four months. However, the swift release of seized boats and the prompt granting of bail to the accused have undermined the effectiveness of the restrictions, environmentalists say.\nAs a result, the GMS has become an unprotected and dangerous zone for the rare turtles. Nature lover Manoj Kumar Nayak said that the Gahirmatha marine zone has been under a fishing ban from November 2024 to May 2025 to protect the nesting of Olive Ridley turtles. During this period, the forest department, marine police, and the Coast Guard are expected to enforce strict surveillance to ensure marine conservation. However, the unregulated movement of boats and trawlers has led to a significantly higher number of turtle deaths than reported by the forest department. Despite a high court order, most boats and trawlers still do not use turtle excluder devices (TEDs). Additionally, the boats operated by the forest department are mostly underpowered and in poor condition, alleged Nayak. Previously, impounded boats and trawlers were not released until the end of the restricted fishing period.\nHowever, now, seized vessels are being promptly released by the courts, allowing their owners to resume fishing activities, he further said. Prakash Chandra Das, president of the Marine Life Protection Committee, warned that turtle nesting sites are under threat. Coastal erosion continues in islands such as Babubali, Madali, and Ekakula. The Forest Department had planned separate conservation initiatives to protect these eroding coastal areas, but no concrete action has been taken so far, he claimed. Environmentalist Hemant Kumar Rout noted that Olive Ridley turtles used to nest along the Chandrabhaga and Ramachandi coasts. However, due to habitat destruction and illegal fishing activities in trawlers, mass nesting of these turtles has not occurred in the region since 2012.\nAlso Read: Man bludgeoned to death over suspicion of sorcery Given that only one in 1,000 eggs typically survives to adulthood, their protection is crucial. Illegal use of gill nets, unauthorized settlements in the protected Bhitarkanika region, and prawn farming enclosures are further endangering the Olive Ridley population, Rout said. When contacted, Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) Manas Kumar Das stated that dedicated surveillance measures are in place. Over the past four months, 30 boats and trawlers, along with 247 unauthorized intruders, have been apprehended. Independent camps and marine patrolling efforts are ongoing in Babubali and Madali islands, with more than 50 personnel deployed around the clock. Forest personnel have collected 255 turtle eggs from sporadic nesting sites, and additional support is expected from the Coast Guard and marine police, he added.",

    "text": "Tall, broad-shouldered and dressed in his distinctive combo of tweed jacket and cravat, Graeme Hall is recognisable to millions as the man who helps desperate pet owners in Channel 5 ’s Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly. The show has legions of followers, many of whom make themselves known to him when we meet to take my own occasionally unruly dog through his paces. Most bustle over to praise him for the pleasure his programme gives them and the advice it doles out. But one fan is a dog, according to its owner, who gushes, ‘You mean so much to him. He’s seen every show.’ Dogs – and their owners – can now enjoy a new series of the show. Highlights in last week’s first episode (available on My5) included a St Bernard with kleptomania and a pug with a foot fetish. Such cases are not unusual in the programme – part of its appeal is the litany of bizarre pet problems, ranging from the hilarious to the horrifying or very moving. Graeme Hall (pictured with Andrew Levy's labradoodle Waffles), who is trained in schutzhund, the German tradition of training dogs in the manner of police hounds for competitions, helps desperate pet owners in Channel 5 ’s Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly Issues have included a disabled boy with speech problems who was constantly being licked in the face by the family pet. His mother eventually admitted the lad kept mumbling ‘Good boy’ to his beloved mutt as he was lashed by its tongue. Filming this sixth series had to be squeezed into Graeme’s schedule. He’d just returned from Down Under shooting Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly Australia when these episodes were made last summer. And a new series, The Dog Hospital With Graeme Hall, aired on Channel 5 in autumn. For someone with such an affinity for dogs, you’d think Graeme, who’s 58, had owned them all his life. In fact, he got his first dog when he was 40, a Rottweiler puppy called Axel. Dogs were banned as a child at home, where his father John was an electrician and mother Mollie a swimming teacher in Selby, North Yorkshire. Graeme believes this was linked to his father’s teens in the war, watching RAF bomber crews drink at his parents’ pub before going out on missions and never returning. Given dogs’ short lifespans, why set yourself up for more grief, he must have thought. Graeme went to grammar school in Leeds before taking a degree in Hispanic Studies and then a job at a Weetabix factory. It was while there that he became interested in schutzhund, the German tradition of training dogs in the manner of police hounds for competitions, and when he decided to leave Weetabix after 21 years a schutzhund trainer convinced him to go into the profession full time. Within months he was holding Kennel Club-listed dog classes and just three years later he was in demand across the UK, and that’s when Channel 5 snapped him up. Pictured: Weekend reporter Andrew Levy with his labradoodle Waffles. After just a few minutes with Graeme, Waffles's behaviour had already improved I’m hoping Graeme can help me with our three-year-old labradoodle Waffles, who goes wild with excitement if he spots another dog, and leaps up on strangers to say hello. Worryingly our other dog Bella, a two-year-old goldendoodle, is picking up some of his habits. Graeme’s skill is explaining why dogs do what they do in simple terms. When we meet up in Hertfordshire he tells me the fact we’d picked up the then eight-week-old Waffles during lockdown is significant. ‘There were no visitors for dogs. So when people like delivery drivers did come, it was, “What the heck is going on? People have come to the door. I’ll scare them away. Job done,”’ he says. ‘The problem is, this leaves them in a world of confusion.’ A few minutes with Graeme and Waffles is already showing a marked improvement. Graeme’s mantra is that it’s seldom dogs that are getting things wrong – it’s their owners. In our case, admonishment needs to be timed exactly right, otherwise Waffles ends up being told off when he’s actually being a good boy. Shortening the lead keeps him close at heel, meaning a small twitch will catch his attention and show him who’s boss. Jumping up at strangers is solved by gently shoving him to the side. ‘Dogs don’t like to be off-balance,’ Graeme explains. Now, with all of us re-educated, Waffles has become an even more lovable pet and we are a happier – and less stressed – family. No wonder Graeme is top dog in his field.",

    "text": "This article was a winner of Lookout’s 2025 Journalism Scholarship Challenge, which invited high school students to highlight an unsung hero in their life. Learn more and find all of the winners here.\nHe champions. He empowers. He listens. He shows up.\nHe is there for every student, every athlete, every workout, race, game, musical and theatrical performance.\nHis welcoming presence, supportive spirit and quiet influence speak volumes about the person he truly is.\nPeople become so mesmerized by the grand gesture and so enveloped by loudness or boldness that it is easy to overlook the quiet forces that bring about significant change. These are the unsung heroes in our community who work tirelessly to improve the lives of others without recognition.\nCoach Todd Hoffman is that type of hero. His selflessness and humility keep him from stepping into the spotlight, but those whom his light touches are forever grateful.\n“We lift each other up. That’s who we are.” These words from Todd, head coach of Scotts Valley High School’s cross-country and track & field Teams, are not empty phrases, they are the bedrock upon which his teams are fortified. So much so that this year’s cross-country captains had it printed on the teams’ shirts.\nHis words are not just reserved for his athletes; they are the words he lives by. Todd’s counsel is sought out by students from all across campus. His authenticity, coupled with his way of not just hearing but listening to others, helps students work through struggles and boost confidence.\nAs one of his athletes, I know first-hand how challenging the sport can be. It takes dedication, tenacity and focus. But the role of coach is much harder. As our coach, Todd simultaneously balances workouts, injuries, goals and mindsets for over 30 runners. He is the champion of our dreams, the cheering squad at each success and the support system at every setback. He has taught me to not only trust the process, but trust myself, a gift of confidence I will not soon forget.\nIn addition to volunteering his time as head coach of two sports teams, Todd is a driving force in generating funding for all sports programs, for better facilities, for injury prevention lectures and for opportunities for athletes. He is a constant presence at all sporting events – often found sitting in the bleachers of basketball games, in the stands for football games, or on the start line for running events. Unbeknownst to many, Todd is there before the teams take the field or court, setting up the sound system or staying late to help put things away.\nA long-standing board member of the Falcon Club, the SVHS Parent Club and the recently formed SVHS 25th Anniversary Committee, Todd is a fierce advocate for funding opportunities, like Measure O.\nTodd Hoffman and the track. Credit: Dylan Turzak Beyond athletics, Todd is an integral part of SVHS’ drama department. From the start of each production to the final curtain call, Todd is there to help the actors become their best selves and lean into their roles. He is considered the “theater angel” to many of the drama students. Todd stays late for auditions and rehearsals, helping actors run lines until late in the day. He helps actors with blocking while boosting their confidence and settling nerves, all while assisting with other miscellaneous tasks such as lighting and set building. His presence in the theater is enough to provide a sense of calm and support.\nTodd has changed my life for the better. He helped me surpass my athletic goals and strive for new ones all while being plagued by injuries and moments of intense self-doubt. He had confidence in me even when I didn’t have any in myself. It is his superpower; a way of letting you walk away feeling better than when you walked in.\nAnd he always seems to have time for each of us who need him, even if it is just to rant about a tough day.\nTrack captain Rayne Leonetti recently said that she “can always expect Todd to bring me out of my head — help me make my anxious and obsessive thoughts fizzle out. That’s what he does, he’s a listener, a true listener, and he always seems to know what to do to help in just the way you need, whether it’s saying something you wanted to hear or something that pushes you in the way you need. He is more than just a coach, he knows how to connect with you, he knows how to push you, how to support you.”\nAs we honor all of the unsung or quietly sung heroes who shape our community, let’s celebrate Coach Todd, a silent guardian and confidant. His service to not only Scotts Valley High School, but to the greater community, is a reminder that heroism comes from the commitment to stepping up to make a difference, no matter how unnoticed or celebrated.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#131](c131#c-131)\nYa veo que eres un negacionista de la realidad. Supongo que encima defenderás a la organización terrorista OTAN.\n[#131](c131#c-131) vamos, que no es para justificarlo ni ahí, pero eso sucede en Rusia desde que existe más o menos. Es como pretender que Estados Unidos no deponga presidentes o asesine a propios y ajenos, bombardeen países y se maten entre ellos.\nNo hay que ser tan simplista.\n#_23 Pura gehopolítika.\n- Sobre la unidad histórica de Rusos y Ucranianos: Durante la reciente Línea Directa, cuando me preguntaron por las relaciones ruso-ucranianas, dije que rusos y ucranianos eran un solo pueblo, un todo único. Estas palabras no estaban motivadas por consideraciones a corto plazo ni por el contexto político actual. Es lo que he dicho en numerosas ocasiones y lo que creo firmemente. Por ello, considero necesario explicar detalladamente mi posición y compartir mis valoraciones sobre la situación actual.\n- La venida de Rusia y el Nuevo Mundo (RIA Novosti): Rusia está restaurando su unidad — la tragedia del año 1991, esta terrible catástrofe en nuestra historia, su antinatural dislocación, ha sido superada. Sí, por un gran coste, sí, a través de los trágicos eventos de una verdadera guerra civil. Porque ahora, aunque todavía haya hermanos se disparándose los unos a los otros, separados por pertenecer a los ejércitos ruso y ucraniano, Ucrania ya no será más anti-Rusia. Rusia está restaurando su completitud histórica, reuniendo el Mundo Ruso, todos los Pueblos Rusos juntos - la totalidad de los grandes rusos, de los rusos blancos, y de los pequeños rusos [rusos, bielorrusos, y ucranianos, respectivamente]. Si hubiéramos abandonado esto, si hubieramos permitido esta separación temporal asentarse durante siglos, entonces no sólo habríamos traicionado el recuerdo de nuestros ancestros, sino que también habríamos maldicho a nuestros herederos con la desintegración de la Tierra Rusa.\n- Putin se compara con Pedro el Grande, el zar que invadió Suecia y Polonia, y lo usa de ejemplo para su guerra en Ucrania: En una sorpresiva declaración, el mandatario ruso se comparó a sí mismo con el zar Pedro I el Grande, y equiparó las campañas militares del despiadado conquistador con la actual invasión a Ucrania.\n\"Pedro el Grande libró la Gran Guerra del Norte durante 21 años. Parecería que estaba en guerra con Suecia, que les quitó algo. No les quitó nada, le devolvió [parte de Suecia a Rusia]\", dijo Putin el jueves tras una visita a una exposición por los 350 años del nacimiento del zar.\n- Entrevista con final feliz de Tucker Carlson a Vladimir Putin: Bajo el reinado de Catalina la Grande, Rusia recuperó todas sus tierras históricas, incluso en el sur y el oeste. Todo esto duró hasta la Revolución. Antes de la Primera Guerra Mundial, el Estado Mayor austriaco, apoyándose en las ideas de la ucranización, empezó a promover activamente las ideas de Ucrania y la ucranización. Su motivo era obvio. Justo antes de la Primera Guerra Mundial, querían debilitar al enemigo potencial y asegurarse unas condiciones favorables en la zona fronteriza. Así que esta idea que había surgido en Polonia de que las personas que residían en ese territorio supuestamente no eran realmente rusas, sino que pertenecían a un grupo étnico especial, los ucranianos, empezó a ser promovida también por el Estado Mayor austriaco.\n[...]\nEn 1922, cuando se estaba creando la URSS, los bolcheviques empezaron a construir la URSS y establecieron la Ucrania soviética, que nunca antes había existido.\n[...]\nStalin insistió en que esas repúblicas se incluyeran en la URSS como entidades autónomas. Por alguna razón inexplicable, Lenin, el fundador del Estado soviético, insistió en que tuvieran derecho a retirarse de la URSS. Y, de nuevo por alguna razón desconocida, transfirió a la recién creada República Soviética de Ucrania algunas de las tierras junto con las personas que vivían allí, a pesar de que esas tierras nunca se habían llamado Ucrania; y, sin embargo, pasaron a formar parte de esa República Soviética de Ucrania.\n[...]\nTras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Ucrania recibió, además de las tierras que habían pertenecido a Polonia antes de la guerra, parte de las tierras que antes habían pertenecido a Hungría y Rumanía (lo que hoy se conoce como Ucrania Occidental). Así que a Rumanía y Hungría se les quitaron algunas de sus tierras y se las dieron a Ucrania, y siguen formando parte de Ucrania. Así que, en este sentido, tenemos todos los motivos para afirmar que Ucrania es un Estado artificial que se formó a voluntad de Stalin.\nComo el gehopolítiko me ha puesto en el ignore para no sufrir disonancia cognitiva, me cuelgo de [#27](c27#c-27). Mis disculpas.\n[#101](c101#c-101) pues eso es lo que me da miedo, que lance un pepino antes de que alguien lo suicide, no porque tenga derecho o porque tenga sentido táctico sino por no caer él\n[#104](c104#c-104) Los hijos de la mayoria de oligarcas en Rusia, estan en las democracias occidentales... antes de que Putin lance la orden, le meten un tiro en la nuca. Yo el riesgo nuclear, lo veo en un cero absoluto.. joderu qeu Rusai lelva años amenazando con el Satan II/Sarmat, y resulta que van 4 intentos de hacerlo volar, cuatro fracasos.\n[#93](c93#c-93) Pues en la guerra de Corea fue por los pelos.\nLlegaron a pisar suelo coreano.\nSolo esperaban la orden.\nY eran mas de dos.\n[#128](c128#c-128) y desde entonces viven perseguidos y paranoicos, pues claro, murieron unos cuantos millones en ese conflicto bastante reciente…. como para no estarlo.\n[#92](c92#c-92) Les ha salido cojonudo. Han hecho una guerra preventiva para evitar el muy improbable escenario de que Ucrania en algún momento dura parte de la OTAN y a consecuencia Suecia y Finlandia se han unido a la coalición y Dinamarca se ha integrado en los planes de defensa de la UE. El mar Báltico que es un punto estratégico para la flota militar Rusa se ha convertido en un lago de la OTAN.\n[#142](c142#c-142) es tu punto de vista, el mío ya le he dado, pero es que además está permitiendo a todos los países que no están sometidos por el imperior alinearse y poder hacerles frente, tener un mundo multipolar. Las prisas han permitido que Finlandia y Suecia no hagan referéndums y queden en evidencia sus dictaduras, y de otra forma les da tiempo a moldear la opinión publica.\nLa alternativa a lo que comentas es que mañana es Ucrania y a los pocos años se unan Finlandia y el resto, porque la expansión de la OTAN no iba a parar. Y tienes lo mismo pero sin el colchón de Ucrania y con misiles a 15 minutos de Moscú. Es decir que dejas que tengan el escenario que ellos han querido para atacarte.\n[#143](c143#c-143) ¿En serio no te das cuenta de hasta que punto tu mensaje es una parodia ridícula?\nClaro que sí, las famosas y despiadadas dictaduras de Suecia y Finlandia, dos de los países con la mayores índices de calidad democrática a nivel mundial, expuestas por el \"democrático\" gobierno del amado líder Putin, que gobierna directa o indirectamente de forma vitalicia desde hace décadas uno de los países más corruptos y autoritarios de toda Eurasia. Un país en el que se encarcela o asesina a opositores de forma constante, en el que se encarcela a gente por referirse a su ataque a Ucrania como guerra, y del cual han huido sus propios conciudadanos por decenas de miles en una fuga de cerebros galopante.\nTu \"mundo multipolar\" no es más que un eufemismo barato para referirse a un mundo dividido y en conflicto constante, repleto de guerras de agresión a diestro y siniestro con millones de muertes de por medio, y con una mayor parte de la población bajo el yugo de gobiernos dictatoriales y fascistas.\n[#144](c144#c-144) ¿democracia burguesa es democracia?\nPero claro, si no sabes distinguir entre ambas es lo que tiene, que confundes vivir bien con tener democracia.\nNo sabes ni por dónde te sopla el aire como para ponerme a discutir contigo sobre la bobada absoluta que has escrito en tu último párrafo.\nMe imagino que las dictaduras te parecen muy mal, pero la de Zelenski estoy seguro que te la pone dura. El dictador Zelensky que no convoca elecciones es tu amigo.\n[#145](c145#c-145) Anda y deja el vino que te sienta mal y dices chorradas.\nQue me salgas hablando de democracia burguesa como si cualquiera de las alternativas que representan tus supuestos participantes de ese mundo multipolar con el que alucinas estuviese más cerca de un sistema más democrático es delirante.\nQue parece que viváis jugando algún videojuego en lugar de tener los pues en la tierra. Vives en en uno de los países con mayores libertades, mejor calidad democrática, y en general con mejores perspectivas a nivel de vida del mundo, y eres tan arrogante que ni te das cuenta de la suerte que tienes y que nada de ello es algo que se pueda dar por supuesto.\nY en lugar de querer extender esa perspectiva o calidad de vida a quienes aún no la poseen, te dedicas a hacerte pajas pensando en un mundo en que gobiernos infinitamente más corruptos, autoritarios y directamente fascistas tengan mayor voz en el mundo y extiendan la influencia de sus políticas de mierda para que aún más gente las sufra.\nPero vamos, que seas incapaz hasta el punto de no entender la imposibilidad logística que suponen unas elecciones en tiempos de guerra, con parte del país ocupado y con bombardeos constantes, pues ya me deja a las claras que tu capacidad lógica escasea. A ti lo que te mola es convicar elecciones amañadas en las que cualquier oposición real o está en la cárcel o en el cementerio, como suele ser habitual en el régimen del colega Putler.\n[#146](c146#c-146) menudo saco de propaganda te han metido en el cerebro, apesta a kilómetros.\nEspaña es un país tan maravilloso que los jóvenes no pueden emanciparse hasta los 30, hay una enorme tasa de desempleo, los sueldos son una mierda y donde se está desmantelando cualquier estado de bienestar. Nuestro jefe de estado es el heredero del un dictador genocida y donde únicamente porque ha tenido la suerte de nacer en un país que por contexto geográfico no ha sido exterminado ni llevado a la edad de piedra como otros que han tenido que partir de cero. Comprarse una vivienda es imposible y tener hijos una utopía. Lo tuyo roza la locura. La prosperidad europea no hubiera sido posible sin la explotación de África y de otros pueblos del mundo, pero vives en tu burbuja ombliguista y de ahí no sales. China ha pasado por la derecha a todos los países del mundo y por eso es una amenaza para quienes solo viven de las guerras.\nHaznos un favor y vete a Argentina a vivir, es una tierra de oportunidades.\n[#29](c29#c-29) Y Morón, San Javier y Zaragoza también\n[#102](c102#c-102) Ucrania y sus socios occidentales llevan mas de un año humillando a Putin y a Rusia, a ver si alguien en el Kremlin se da cuenta de que esto va a terminar muy mal para su pais y para su pueblo, y le meten una bala en la cabeza al zumbado de Putin..\nPara mi, una de las imagenes mas humillantes para el Kremlin, la vimos hace justo un año, un misil britanico donado a Ucrania, en video golpeando el cuartel general de la flota rusa del Mar Negro en Sevastopol, Crimea\n[#47](c47#c-47) Estás que te sales. Que gustazo ver como rabian.\n[#119](c119#c-119) Pues que se vayan a escuchar los chistes de Zelenski.\nEsos marujos de resiliencia nuclear.\n[#85](c85#c-85) Rusia es un país que aún tiene un largo camino por recorrer para ser democrático. Es el más corrupto de Eurasia y le falta mucho para cumplir los requisitos mínimos para ingresar en la OTAN. Sin embargo, hubo un tiempo en que tanto Rusia como la OTAN mantenían muy buenas relaciones.\n[#56](c56#c-56) Pues si contemplaban en el que están metidos, menudos estrategas!\n[#123](c123#c-123) no invade Finlandia porque ya está en guerra con la OTAN en el frente abierto de Ucrania y no necesita abrir dos frentes.\nFinlandia es ejemplo perfecto de qué pasa si esperas a que te acepten, que cuando quieras reaccionar ya pertenece a la OTAN y es demasiado tarde. En este caso Finlandia no supone un frente tan peligroso como el de Ucrania, con el que había un acuerdo de neutralidad que se rompió y que está ubicada en un punto clave. Para Rusia mucho mejor atacar Ucrania ahora que pertenenciendo a la OTAN.\n[#72](c72#c-72) Pero eso no entra dentro de la doctrina nuclear.\n[#99](c99#c-99) Ya se encargaron los pensadores de la guerra fría de montarlo de tal manera que si Rusia o EEUU atacan por sorpresa lanzándolo todo al otro, aunque no quedase nadie vivo en el país, los misiles de respuesta se lanzarían solos y destruirían al oponente (y al resto del mundo).\n[#4](c4#c-4) Para los naziotánistas, parece.\n#_9 ¿El que se ha cargado un barco con todos los aparejos para los F16.\nVaya floripondio no permite que se le ratifique.\n[#13](c13#c-13) No le queda otra,... y lo sabe.\n[#39](c39#c-39) Claro porque al contrario de EEUU/EU necesitan mas de lo que tienen en su país, si es que donde no\nhay...\n[#47](c47#c-47) Pobre Finlandia, ni los escombros quedaría.\n[#69](c69#c-69) los guía el líder Supremo\nEso no se\nPero si consideramos un rango de 1000-2500km largo alcance, Rusia ha recibido y usando armas de otros países, y mas que probado.\nY a saber lo que ha conseguido de China por debajo de las sabanas...\n[#112](c112#c-112) EEUU humillo al ejercito de Hussein en 5 semanas.. EEUU es una superpotencia economica, industrial y militar en todos los jodidos aspectos, lo vemos a diario, su capacidad militar, sus empresas tecnologicas, su industria, su programa espacial.....los indices microeconomicos en Rusia son similares al de paises tercermundistas. Rusia en la practica es un pais subdesarrollado que sobrevive de la propaganda, la mentira, y una herencia caduca que le dejaron otros hace mas de 30 años. En el pueblo de mis yayos, tienen mejores salarios y mejor calidad de vida que en Moscu y San Petersburgo, las dos superurbes rusas, las mas ricas....\n[#114](c114#c-114) EEUU es una superpotencia economica, industrial y militar en todos los jodidos aspectos\nPero tuvo que salir huyendo miserablemente al intentar luchar contra un puñado de campesinos en Vietnam. De hehco... ¿qué guerras ha ganado?\nEso te demuestra que se puede ser una \"superpotencia militar\" y perder una guerra cuando todo parecía indicar que sería fácil ganarla. Lo mismo puede estar pasando con Rusia. O no. Lo sabremos cuando esto termine.\n[#83](c83#c-83) ahora me entero que cuando EEUU lanzo las bombas la USRR ya tenia bombas nucleares...\n[#121](c121#c-121) ¿qué tiene que ver con bombardear población civil con armas nucleares?\n[#57](c57#c-57) Apuesto a que no se hizo para joder a nadie excepto a Rusia.\n[#91](c91#c-91) Queda claro que no fue una victoria aplastante como se podría esperar de una potencia militar. Pero no debería sorprendernos después de ver cómo perdió Estados Unidos en Vietnam por ejemplo.\nPero yo prefiero esperar a ver el resultado porque no me fío para nada de las noticias.\n[#105](c105#c-105) No fue una victoria aplastante, por que la mentira tiene las patas muy cortas. .Y no, Rusia nunca fue potencia militar, solo son potencia en vivir de la propaganda y la mentira, no tienen industria ni capacidad para lograr sus objetivos contra uno de los paises mas pobres de occidente...Rusia en 3 meses, ha tenido bastantes mas bajas de personal militar que EEUU en mas de 60 años de guerras en las que se ha metido. Los rusos llevan años viviendo del cuento de la herencia sovietica, sus aviones 'modernos' realmente son aviones sovieticos con ligeras mejoras, realmente Rusia no tiene nada de industria moderna, no producen una mierda de nada, hace mas de 30 años que no producen un solo tanque blindado nuevo, los programas del armata y el su57 estan muertos, Rusia solo extrae recursos cuya inmensa mayoria ni si quiera son capaces de procesar.\nLa URSS perdio en Afganistan, Rusia perdio las dos guerras chechenas, solo recordar que toda Chechenia tenia menos poblacion de la que hoy tiene la capital Kyiv.\n[#107](c107#c-107) No fue una victoria aplastante, por que la mentira tiene las patas muy cortas. .Y no, Rusia nunca fue potencia militar, solo son potencia en vivir de la propaganda y la mentira,\nEntonces tendríamos que decir exactamente lo mismo de Estados Unidos, ¿no?\n[#74](c74#c-74) te voy a contestar con una simpleza, Crimea y el mar negro, eres un ignorante y lo sabes. Para que voy a votar negativo tu comentario, que te crees que soy un crio como tú?\n[#113](c113#c-113) ya vemos el control del mar negro de Rusia incluso con Crimea en su \"poder\".\nIgnorante yo? espero que no te salga mi reflejo en el espejo cuando te mires\n[#116](c116#c-116) hombre si no sabes lo que implica que pase con Crimea si Ucrania si entra en la OTAN, si no lo sabes y estas hablando de todo el tema del origen de la guerra, eres totalmente un ignorante. Sin más.\n[#89](c89#c-89) Querido #89, me alegra que preguntes. Los acuerdos de Minsk son como una receta de cocina que nadie en la cocina se molestó en seguir. Firmados para ponerle fin al conflicto en Ucrania allá por 2014 y 2015, establecían un cese al fuego y una serie de medidas diplomáticas, como si todos estuvieran en una telenovela mala prometiendo no tirar más platos… pero, sorpresa, nadie cumplió con su parte. Así que, ¿de qué hablo? Hablo del clásico ‘yo no fui, fue Teté’, pero a nivel geopolítico. Si no lo entendiste, no te culpo, los firmantes tampoco lo hicieron.\n[#157](c157#c-157) Exacto, Rusia continuaba con su intervención y Ucrania no movía la línea del frente. De hecho, tanto estaba funcionando que en 2022 el conflicto ya estaba desactivado. Las regiones apoyadas por Moscú habían perdido impulso después de saquearlo todo, además de no tener ningún derecho. No eran ni rusos ni ucranianos y tenían a un agente de la inteligencia rusa como gobernador. Al ver que estaba perdiendo influencia, Putin decidió recuperarla invadiendo.\nTonto. Los demás también.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Es muy peligroso el juego que tiene los anglosajones en Europa a los anglosajones les gusta mucho los juegos y las apuestas jugar al límite puede ganar o puede ser eliminado totalmente del juego.",

    "title": "Calzature e pelletterie. La crisi non risparmia il segmento del lusso",
    "text": "Nel 2025 le vendite di calzature saliranno dell’1% mentre per le pelletteria l’incremento previsto è del 2%\nLa crescita a valore delle vendite di calzature nel 2025 saranno pari a +1% mentre per le pelletteria l’incremento previsto è pari a +2%. Questi sono alcuni dei dati contenuti nel rapporto Altagamma Consensus . Nel rapporto emerge che l’aumento definito modesto è causato: \"per la pelletteria, gli aumenti di prezzi, il calo dei consumatori occasionali e del turismo cinese hanno ridotto le vendite e aumentato gli stock. Le vendite delle calzature vedono una saturazione del casual e una ricerca di nuove proposte sempre focalizzate sul comfort\".\nPer quanto riguarda l’analisi dei canali distributivi dei beni di lusso il rapporto evidenzia come \"il canale retail continui ad essere il canale d’elezione per i Personal Luxury Goods e cresce in modo significativo accompagnato dal retail digital. Il canale wholesale sia digitale che fisico riduce drasticamente il proprio impatto\". È particolarmente importante analizzare l’approccio dei consumatori soprattutto stranieri agli acquisti di beni di lusso. Nel distretto del fermano, infatti, soprattutto negli ultimi anni sono state numerose le aziende di brands del lusso che hanno deciso di aprire stabilimento per utilizzare la competenza delle maestranze della zona. Inoltre nel fermano possono contare su quelle realtà aziendali spesso di piccole e piccolissime dimensioni che lavorano come terziste.\nFino a pochi anni fa era la Cina il mercato più importante per i prodotti del lusso, ma le previsioni per il 2025 sono dettate da un cauto ottimismo. Secondo il report di Altagamma, infatti i cinesi \"non sono più i best performer del comparto e la contrazione è stata significativa. La crescita resta positiva con un +2% e una possibile ripresa dei viaggi nella seconda metà dell’anno. La fiducia è fortemente intaccata dalla crisi del real estate e dai tassi di disoccupazione giovanile. Il nuovo Luxury Shame , fenomeno socioculturale, potrebbe protrarsi\". Il Luxury Shame è quel fenomeno che interessa le persone ricche, appartenenti alla classe medio-alta, le quali si vergognano di mostrare in pubblico la propria agiatezza. A causa della paura di essere giudicati male, se non maltrattati, da coloro che non posseggono altrettanta fortuna economica. Attualmente il luxury shame è un fenomeno decisamente forte in Cina e il Governo ha adottato una serie di misure contro l’ostentazione del lusso\".\nPer quanto riguarda il mercato europeo, invece, \"Continuano a risentire del contesto macroeconomico: tassi di interesse alti, inflazione, venti recessivi e due guerre vicine indeboliscono la spinta ai consumi. Crescono però i risparmi e dunque la ricchezza permane. Sono da sempre consumatori più cauti e maturi: nel 2025 non si stimano crescite significative 2%\". Best performer nel 2025 saranno gli americani \"con un +4,5%. Nella fase post elezioni i consumi dovrebbero riprendere e il calo dell’inflazione (anche se la Fed non ha operato il taglio dei tassi generando parecchio malcontento) potrebbe agevolare i consumatori medio-alti e aspirazionali che avevano sofferto\".\nVittorio Bellagamba\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo",

    "text": "Voir mon actu Suivre L'Orne Hebdo L’association Sauvegarde du patrimoine de Macé , créée en 2022 , a pour mission de faire connaître l’histoire du village, situé près de Sées, et soutenir la commune pour la sauvegarde de l’église Saint-Aubin . « C’est le bâtiment communal qui sert le plus, après la mairie », justifie Guillaume Leveel, secrétaire de l’association. Un édifice dont la construction remonte à plus d’un millénaire .\nUn chantier de grande ampleur L’église a été profondément remaniée vers 1880 et, actuellement, les éléments les plus anciens datent du XI e siècle . « Les travaux à réaliser sont titanesques et la commune ne peut les supporter seule », précise Guillaume Leveel. On recense plusieurs dizaines de milliers d’euros de travaux urgents.\nÀ lire aussi\nVIDEO Symbole de la Libération, ce char de l’Orne restauré : « on a même conservé les trous d’obus » Il s’agit principalement de travaux de toitures , de drainage et de reprise de maçonnerie . Certains sont impérieux car l’eau s’infiltre et fait des dégâts à de nombreux endroits de l’édifice, notamment à la sacristie qui est très abîmée. L’association, qui compte actuellement une trentaine de membres , fait appel aux donateurs et à toutes les bonnes volontés. Elle organise un concert avec la chorale Résonance du Mêle-sur-Sarthe (variété française et polyphonies), samedi 1er juin à 20 h 30, à la salle polyvalente de Surdon, au profit de la restauration de l’église. Libre participation.\nD’autres événements prévus D’autres événements en lien avec l’église sont à venir comme les auditions de l’école de musique de Sées, organisées le samedi 15 juin, à 14 h, pour les classes de clarinette et de trompette, et le jeudi 4 juillet, à 18 h 30, pour les classes de guitare et de hautbois. Entrée libre.\nDes actions auront lieu dans le cadre du 150e anniversaire du retour des reliques de Saint Rasyphe et Saint Raven en l’église de Macé. Une procession à la pierre des martyrs se tiendra, samedi 8 juin à 18 h, suivie d’une messe célébrée par Mgr Feillet, évêque de Séez. Dimanche 28 juillet, un pèlerinage sera organisé entre la basilique de l’Immaculée-Conception de Sées et l’église de Macé.\nUn peu d’histoire… Saint Rasyphe et Saint Raven sont deux frères (un prêtre et un diacre), originaires de Grande-Bretagne, venus s’installer à Macé au IVe siècle. Ils attirèrent rapidement les foules, édifiant leurs ouailles par leur vie ascétique et soignant les malades. Ils furent martyrisés sur une pierre, dite « pierre des martyrs » , encore visible dans le bourg de Macé. Au VIIe siècle, l’église Saint-Aubin fut construite sur leur tombeau et fut, au Moyen-Âge, le centre d’un prieuré bénédictin.\nCependant, au IXe siècle, les habitants de Macé mirent leurs reliques à l’abri des vikings dans la forteresse de Saint-Vaast-sur-Seulles, près de Bayeux. En 1047, elles furent transportées à la cathédrale de Bayeux dont les deux saints devinrent patrons secondaires. » En 1065, on peut penser qu’Harold prêta serment de fidélité à Guillaume le Conquérant sur leurs reliques dans une scène représentée sur la tapisserie de Bayeux « , souligne Guillaume Leveel, qui est également féru d’Histoire.\nÀ lire aussi\nLa stèle à la mémoire de l’aviateur américain Paul Chaufty dévoilée Au XVIe siècle, les reliques furent sauvées des protestants qui pillèrent Bayeux et conduites à Grancey, en Bourgogne. Ce n’est qu’en 1874 que l’évêque de Dijon redonna une partie de ces reliques à l’évêque de Séez qui, le 26 juillet 1874, les fit conduire en procession de la basilique de l’Immaculée-Conception de Sées à l’église de Macé, en présence de plus de 3 000 pèlerins .\nContact de l’association : [email protected] ou 06 72 56 90 30.

La FGE Guerrero indicó que su aprehensión responde a una orden de captura girada en su contra por el delito de extorsión agravada. ‘El Aguado’ es señalado de cometer dicho delito en las colonias El Coloso, El PRI y en el poblado de La Sabana, donde tenía su bastión. La orden girada en su contra consta en una carpeta iniciada por extorsión a un comerciante de venta de carne en el mercado de La Sabana, registrada en 2019. “De acuerdo a la investigación, el hecho por el que se le persigue, sucedió entre el 15 y 20 de septiembre del 2019, cuando el hoy imputado en compañía de otros tres sujetos, exigieron la cantidad de 70,000 pesos al propietario de un establecimiento comercial en el poblado La Sabana, con la finalidad de no hacerle daño a él ni a su familia”, explicó la dependencia en un comunicado emitido esta mañana. Sin embargo, la Fiscalía Estatal destaca que Víctor Hugo ‘N’ también era identificado como objetivo prioritario en la entidad. De acuerdo con la institución trabajos de inteligencia lo ubican como jefe de plaza de ‘Los Rusos’, grupo armado con presencia en Acapulco y en la región Costa Chica. A “El Aguado” también se le atribuyen homicidios y narcomenudeo. Esta mañana en punto de las 08:30 horas, Víctor Hugo fue presentado ante el Juez de Control, en una audiencia inicial que se lleva a cabo en los juzgados de la zona Diamante de la ciudad. En sus redes sociales, el Fiscal General, Zipacná Jesús Torres Ojeda, destacó que con la captura de Víctor Hugo “se logra la inhabilitación de un importante número de extorsiones en la zona oriente del puerto.”",
