    "title": "Propel People: $3 Million Seed Raised To Help Contractors Hire Skilled Tradespeople",
    "text": "1848 Ventures, an AI-focused venture studio that creates SaaS solutions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the US, announced leading a $3 million seed funding round for Propel People, a mobile-first hiring platform designed to help contractors find skilled tradespeople more quickly.\nThe company also appointed industry expert Dexter Bachelder as its CEO, bringing extensive experience in construction technology and go-to-market strategies. Developed within the 1848V Venture Studio, Propel People addresses one of the construction sector’s most significant issues: hiring.\nWith most contractors struggling to find skilled workers and over $20 billion lost annually due to labor shortages, their AI-driven platform streamlines and accelerates trade hiring through features like intelligent candidate ranking, instant screening, and engaging SMS communication. Propel’s proprietary ProScore engine rapidly ranks applicants, while two-way texting improves response rates and pre-screening.\nThe platform supports both English and Spanish and is tailored for contractors who work primarily in the field. Dexter Bachelder offers over 25 years of experience in SaaS, AI, and construction technology, including leadership roles at Aconex (IPO and acquired by Oracle), Command Alkon (acquired by Thoma Bravo), Togal.AI, and Slate.AI.\nThis investment highlights 1848 Ventures’ dedication to scaling AI-native software companies that address tangible SMB needs. Propel exemplifies how the studio is building and investing in vertical SaaS startups that aim to transform overlooked areas of the economy.\nHow the funding will be used: The funding will boost product development, grow the engineering and go-to-market teams, and support Propel’s expansion into key contractor markets across the U.S.\nKEY QUOTES:\n“Labor shortages are the number one threat to growth, profitability, and safety in the construction industry. Propel People was built from the ground up to address this exact problem. By combining AI-native infrastructure with a field-first user experience, Propel is redefining what hiring can look like for the trades. With Dexter at the helm, we’re confident the company will lead the next wave of innovation in skilled labor recruitment.”\nKal Amin, Managing Partner at 1848 Ventures\n“After 25 years in construction tech, I’ve learned that solving the skilled labor shortage is not just the industry’s biggest challenge, it’s also its greatest opportunity. Contractors need to hire great people to deliver quality projects, yet the industry is short more than 500,000 skilled workers just to meet current demand. Most hiring tools weren’t built for how construction actually works—on the move, in the field, and under pressure. Propel People is different. We’re using AI and a mobile-first platform to help contractors build crews faster, smarter, and more efficiently—from job post to jobsite. I’m proud to partner with 1848 Ventures to support the people who build our world and help solve one of their most urgent problems.”\nDexter Bachelder, CEO of Propel People",

    "title": "Nord Stream Ecocide & Fall of Germany ‘Engineered by Western Powers’ – Analyst",
    "text": "The United States must answer some day for the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline and the resultant collapse of its German ally’s economy, says analyst George Szamuely.The senior research fellow at London’s Global Policy Institute joined Sputnik’s The Critical Hour program this week to discuss the controversial incident, which some experts claim represented “the largest single methane gas” release ever recorded.“It's always remarkable that the most belligerent actors in any drama are the ones who are the furthest away from the action,” said Szamuely, responding to reports that the UK has taken a leading role in providing drones and other equipment for Ukraine’s proxy war against Russia. “The British have been consistently the most belligerent on Ukraine.”“There is no way in the world it can be done, an invasion, without very accurate satellite intelligence. You can't do it. You can't just simply launch an invasion without knowing the terrain, the exact disposal of Russian forces. So clearly this was engineered by the Western powers, the British obviously – the British are now boasting about it – but above all, the Americans.”German authorities claimed they had wound a new lead in the case of 2022’s Nord Stream pipeline explosion last week, pinning the blame on a small group led by a Ukrainian diving instructor. The whereabouts of the new suspect are conveniently unknown, the officials claimed.Germany’s economic growth has cratered in the wake of the country’s loss of cheap Russian natural gas, with the European Commission estimating the country’s GDP will only expand by .1% this year. Polling has shown most Germans remain concerned over the lack of clarity over the pipeline’s explosion, which has widely been alleged by journalist Seymour Hersh and others to have been engineered by the United States.“The more serious issue is that Germany is really losing its position as an economic giant, as an economic superpower,” said Szamuely. “It's now steadily going from one quarter after another into recession. But even more seriously, the German industries are being sidelined. They're moving out of Europe and they're being priced out of markets because there's just simply the energy costs. They're now really going through the roof.”Host Garland Nixon agreed that the situation is “very dangerous,” speculating that the US and its allies are likely escalating their involvement in the Ukraine proxy war to attempt to negate the threat of a newly-reelected President Donald Trump seeking to end the conflict. Szamuely suggested that Republican allies such as notorious neoconservative Lindsay Graham would likely move to impeach Trump in such an event.Szamuely also claimed Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Deutschland party could stand to gain from the declining popularity of the NATO-backed war, with the German establishment seeking to “crackdown” on the controversial party.At some point Germans will seek to regain their sovereignty and oppose Washington’s influence over the country, Szamuely speculated.“No one in Germany is buying it,” Szamuely said of German officials’ latest explanation for the Nord Stream pipeline explosion. “It's a violation of common sense… Even if the German government is committed to this and saying, ‘oh, well Ukraine is behind this, which of course undercuts its position as to why you are assisting Ukraine since Ukraine is destroying your own infrastructure, Ukraine is creating ecocide.”“‘They humiliate you, they destroy your infrastructure, they destroy your industry. This is what we're supposed to sacrifice ourselves for?’ So it's a huge problem. And the Germans are going to try and kick the can down the road, try not to address it. But… at some point they're going to have to really seriously look at this.” https://sputnikglobe.com/20240229/explosive-truth-of-us-nord-stream-sabotage-could-destroy-nato-1117047722.html https://sputnikglobe.com/20240816/western-governments-sell-farfetched-nord-stream-tale-to-wary-public-1119787937.html https://sputnikglobe.com/20240823/beyond-mccarthyism-fbi-promises-continued-crackdown-on-us-journalists-dissidents-1119879025.html united kingdom (uk) germany ukraine",
