    "text": "By Brian Knapp ,\n21 hours ago\nPaul Hughes leans into the tasks placed before him, no matter how difficult they may seem.\nThe surging 27-year-old contender will answer the Professional Fighters League ’s call to arms when he challenges an undefeated Usman Nurmagomedov for the Bellator MMA lightweight title in the PFL Champions Series 1 headliner on Saturday at Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Hughes steps back into the spotlight with a seven-fight winning streak in tow. The former Cage Warriors Fighting Championship titleholder last saw action at PFL Super Fights “Battle of the Giants,” where he was awarded a split decision over A.J. McKee in their three-round battle on Oct. 19.\nAs Hughes makes final preparations for his “Road to Dubai” main event opposite Nurmagomedov, here are five things you might not know about him:\n1. He traveled non-traditional routes to martial arts.\nHughes was born on March 27, 1997 in Sydney—a whopping 10,628 miles from his current base of operations—but grew up in Lavey, Northern Ireland. He flirted with Gaelic football and hurling before he transitioned to mixed martial arts .\n2. Youth was served in his case.\n“Big News” made his professional MMA debut at the age of 19, when he needed just 92 seconds to put away Adam Gustab with punches under the British Association of Mixed Martial Arts banner on Feb. 24, 2017. Hughes finished his first six opponents, four of them inside one round, and established himself as on of Europe’s top prospects in short order.\n3. Adversity did nothing to quench his fire.\nHughes suffered his first setback at Cage Warriors 119, where he wound up on the wrong side of split scorecards against Jordan Vucenic . A little less than two years later, he took a unanimous decision from Vucenic in their Cage Warriors 145 rematch, cementing himself as the superior fighter.\n4. He backed up his promise with achievement.\nThe once-beaten Irishman remains one of only 14 men who have captured the undisputed Cage Warriors featherweight championship. Vucenic, Paul McVeigh , Emmanuel Fernandez , Danny Batten , Conor McGregor , Jim Alers , Alex Enlund , Paddy Pimblett , Nad Narimani , Dean Trueman , Mads Burnell , Morgan Charriere and Harry Hardwick complete the list. Hughes held the title for less than a year before he decided to move up to 155 pounds.\n5. Loyalty has not been an issue.\nHughes operates out of the Fight Academy Ireland in Belfast, where he provides the under-the-radar gym with a true cornerstone and trains under longtime coach Liam Shannon .",

    "title": "Varadero Beach in Cuba Ranked Among World’s Top 50 Beaches 2023",
    "text": "London, Jan 7 (Prensa Latina) Varadero Beach, in Cuba, was selected as one of the 50 best in the\nworld in 2023, after an analysis that included the opinions of various experts.\nAccording to the specialized portal Las\n50 best beaches of the world, it is a list that compiles the votes of about 750 of the influential people.\nThe most recognized and experienced journalists and travel experts in the\nworld, including the Beach Ambassadors, were in charge of developing the relationship.\nVaradero, the Cuban resort, was ranked 48th on the list headed by Lucky Beach located in Australia.\nAccording to the website, it is the most accurate and best-researched summary of beaches ever collected.\nThe first ten:\n1- Navagio Beach, in Zakynthos, Greece\nNavagio Beach in Zakynthos, Greece is located in a beautiful, secluded cove surrounded by towering golden cliffs that is only accessible by boat. On the shore is the Freightliner MV Panagiotis wreck, adding another unique element to this stunning location.\n2- Playa de Whitsunday (Queensland)\nThis stunning beach is located on Queensland’s Whitsunday Islands and is only accessible by helicopter or seaplane. The contrast of the piercing white sand with the fluorescent green background of the tropical forest in the island’s mountains will leave you speechless. With over 290 days of sunshine a year and an average temperature of 27 degrees Celsius, you are sure to enjoy a soak in the sun and sand while enjoying the Coral Sea from this remote island.\n3- Hidden Beach (Marietas Islands, Mexico)\nYou can distinguish this postcard-perfect beach from the rest by one magnificent feature: those unmistakable limestone cliffs. Leaving the turquoise blue lagoon directly into the sky, they draw your eyes away from the spectacular reefs and palm tree-lined shores. Until recently, the only people who came to this remote island were the cliff-nesting swiftlets. Now, luxurious resorts invite you to spend a unique vacation.\n4- Praia do Sancho (Brazil)\nLocated on the small island of Fernando de Noronha, about an hour off the coast of Brazil, remote Praia do Sancho is one of the best beaches in the\nworld. But while its beauty is easy to appreciate, the beach itself is difficult to reach. You have to walk, slide through a dark and narrow tunnel and go down steep stairs to finally reach this beach. Furthermore, being in a national park you also have to pay to access it. However, it is definitely worth it.\n5- Tulum Beach (Quintana Roo, Mexico)\nTulum beach is a destination par excellence for travelers looking for an idyllic and serene getaway. Stunning white sands and bright blue-green waters combine to create a beach that leaves an impression on travelers. The boardwalk that runs along the beach offers a collection of bohemian-style restaurants and accommodations.\n6- Grace Bay (Turks and Caicos Islands)\nAt Grace Bay in the Turks and Caicos Islands, bright blue water laps against a white sand beach, inviting you to immerse yourself in paradise. Grace Bay is one of the most famous beaches in the\nworld for good reason. An offshore reef is home to thousands of marine animals. The reef protects the beach from powerful waves, creating a smooth surface that allows swimming and diving.\n7- Seven Mile Beach (Jamaica)\nSeven Mile Beach in Negril, Jamaica, offers an idyllic ocean scene. Palm trees leaning at 30-degree angles almost brush the sand while turquoise water flows over the beach. The island’s vegetation separates the beach from the city, creating a remote environment even though it is easily accessible.\n8-Anse Source D’Argent in Seychelles\nAnse Source D’Argent in Seychelles is the most photographed beach in the\nworld and it is not surprising because this beach with fine sand and turquoise waters is worth keeping forever in your memory. Its shore adorned with pebbles, fine sand and turquoise water delight sun and beach lovers and even more so those who like to walk about a kilometer before the ocean reaches their waist.\n9- Playa Maya Bay (Tailand)\nIt’s easy to see why this beach has been chosen as the backdrop for dozens of movies. Looking at the turquoise bay from the sand, protected by the lush mountains, the visitor feels a million miles away from everything. To get here you have to rent a boat, but it is worth the adventure for the opportunity to experience true paradise.\n10- Varadero Beach (Cuba)\nIn recent years, Cuba has become a major vacation destination thanks to its history, pastel-colored houses, and spectacular beaches. Varadero beach is the best on the island with its fine white sand bathed by blue water. Hotels lining the beach ensure impeccable accommodation and excellent luxury dining options.\n2024-01-07 21:33:08\n#Varadero #Beach #Cuba #among #\nworld #Photos",
