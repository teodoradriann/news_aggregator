    "title": "Violent and property crime down in Hampton, police chief says",
    "text": "Both violent and property crime are down the first six months of this year compared to the start of the last two years, according to Hampton Police Chief Jimmie Wideman.\nWideman briefed the City Council Wednesday on year-to-date crime statistics from 2022-2024, showing how crime rates compare from Jan. 1 to July 8 of each year.\nSo far, there have been 153 violent crimes reported this year, which include murders or nonnegligent manslaughter, rape or sexual assault, robberies, and aggravated assault. This is down 17.3% from the 185 violent crimes committed at this same point last year and also below the 175 violent crimes committed by this point in 2022.\nThe city has reported 5 cases of murder or nonnegligent manslaughter so far this year — down from 17 in 2023 and 13 in 2022.\nHowever, there was a slight uptick in “forcible rape” (15 this year compared to 14 in 2023) and “forcible sodomy” (6 this year compared to 4 in 2023). Regarding rape and sexual assault, Wideman told the council “none of those instances” involved situations where the suspect and victim did not know each other.\nHe said most of the violence in the city was not random and that a majority of the violent crimes were among people who knew each other, which increases the chances police are able to make an arrest.\n“Once we remove them from the communities, the communities are instantaneously safer because we have bad actors that commit multiple offenses,” Wideman told the council. “So even by the numbers that you see, some of those numbers are attributed to the same suspect.”\nCity Manager Mary Bunting said the city’s Hopeful Hampton initiative — which aims to reduce gun violence among teens and young adults — is based on the premise that most violent crime in the community is committed by a limited number of actors. By focusing the city’s attention on those people, she said the city can bring down the rates of crime. She said she believes the city has been making progress.\n“Many of the people that we’re talking about have deep-rooted issues in their life,” Bunting said. “I mean, these are not people who just decide to be criminals. Many of these people have struggled with trauma, unresolved trauma in their life. And I’m not making excuses for them, because they’re doing bad things, and we need to hold them accountable. But these are difficult, difficult situations, and that’s why (we have) prevention and intervention and enforcement all working together.”\nAlso down this year are property crimes. The city reported 2,010 property crimes so far this year — which include burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft — down from 2,199 property crimes in 2023 and 2,095 in 2022. That includes 1,702 larcenies so far, compared to 1,850 in 2023 and 1,770 in 2022. Motor vehicle thefts dropped 42% from 215 in the first six months of last year to 173 this year.\nSince taking over as police chief last year , Wideman said he’s made an effort to ensure that police are building and capitalizing on relationships with local businesses and communities so that they can help police identify names of criminals and provide tips about situations that require police attention. He said his department has also been dedicating more resources to various areas of the city that are known to have more problems.\nWideman told the Daily Press he attributes the reduction in crime to a better relationship between law enforcement and the city’s residents. He said that police have formed key partnerships with the local faith community, businesses, community organizations, nonprofits, and concerned citizens to help address gun violence in the community.\n“I have an amazing staff that is very proactive,” Wideman said. “I stay out of the way and let them take their talents and invest their talents into the work that we do. And they’re very, very invested in the mission.”\nJosh Janney, joshua.janney@virginiamedia.com",

    "text": "Easter is meant to be a symbol of hope, renewal and a new life for Christians across the world as it is believed by the community to be the dawn of a new beginning, a time of resurrection and a celebration of life that reminds us that hope must never be lost, for as dark as the road may seem, there always lies light at the end of it. It is a day of feasting and celebration during which people attend prayer services, decorate and distribute Easter eggs and play traditional Easter games but unlike Christmas, there is no fixed date for the festival of Easter.According to the New Testament of the Bible, the holiday occurs three days after the crucifixion of Jesus by Romans and concludes the “Passion of Christ”, which begins with a 40 days period of fasting – Lent and is concluded by the Holy Week.Date:This year, Easter will be celebrated by the Christian community across the world on Sunday, March 31.History:The story behind Easter lies in the New Testament of the Bible which narrates how Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities because he claimed to be the “Son of God”. He was then sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate, the Roman emperor by crucifixion. His resurrection three days later marks the occasion of Easter. This day is also closely associated with the Jewish festival of Passover.According to the New Testament, it is believed to have occurred on the third day (after his burial) following his crucifixion by the Romans at Calvary. It is the culmination of the religious season of Lent, a 40-day period of fasting, prayer, and penance.Significance:The day marks the return of Christ who sacrificed himself for the sins of humanity. The resurrection proves him as the true son of God who defeated evil and death before ascending to heaven.Easter marks the completion of the Passion of Christ, beginning from Lent and ending with Holy Week, which includes Holy Thursday (also Maundy Thursday which celebrates Jesus’ Last Supper with his 12 Apostles), Good Friday (when Jesus’ crucifixion is observed) and finally ending with Easter Sunday.Celebration:People tend to splurge during Easter as it comes after 40 days of Lent. Brightly painted chocolate-filled eggs are exchanged, and Easter Bunny delivers chocolate eggs to kids, there are Easter eggs hunts and plenty more fun activities on Easter.Easter Vigil, a religious service, is how many churches begin Easter celebration in the late hours of the Saturday before. There are several non-religious celebrations too including Easter eggs. Eggs represent birth and fertility, and it is believed they are used during Easter festivities to symbolise Jesus’ rebirth. Non–religious celebrations include the tradition of Easter eggs, which represent fertility and birth and Easter bunny which delivers chocolates and sweets to kids on Sunday morning.Easter Sunday and related celebrations, such as Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday and Palm Sunday, are considered “moveable feasts”. Although Easter has a lot of religious significance in Christianity, several traditions date to pre-Christian, pagan times. This Christian celebration is also closely associated with the Jewish festival of Passover as well as the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, as described in the Old Testament.It is a day of feasting and celebration during which people attend prayer services, decorate and distribute Easter eggs and play traditional Easter games such as egg rolling, egg tapping and egg decorating. The Easter egg like the Easter lily (that is used for decoration in Churches) represents new life and fertility.",

    "title": "Community collects and destroys invasive plants in battle to save local lands from harmful species: 'What we're trying to do here is to establish the prairie'",
    "text": "An Indiana community has come together to rid an area of ecological importance from invasive plant species.\nWith help from AmeriCorps, a U.S. government agency that engages volunteers, the City of Mishawaka is working to remove invasive foxtail grass, thistle , and honeysuckle, among other problematic plants.\nNative plants will replace the invasive species . Native plants are suited to local soil types and weather conditions and help to prevent the future growth of invasives. Sugar maple, red oak, and purple coneflower will be some of the plants that will soon thrive in the area.\nThe mission is to restore the land to help local wildlife set up habitats and pollinate plants, while the addition of some exotic plants will keep pests away .\n\"These are all just woody things, not all of it is invasive, but it is forest, woody shrubs, and so if these establish then they'll become trees, which will knock out the prairie below it, and what we're trying to do here is to establish the prairie, so these prairie species have a place to be,\" AmeriCorps member Emme Thomas told WNDU .\nWhile community efforts like these are vital, creating a better ecosystem and boosting biodiversity doesn't have to be the work of many. In fact, it can happen in your backyard .\nWatch now: Would you wear a shirt made out of oysters? Even a small patch of land dedicated to native plants can make a difference. We all benefit from the birds and insects these garden additions will bring.\nAccording to the U.S. Forest Service , around 80% of the plants used in the food sector and for the production of plant-based industrial products rely on the presence of pollinators .\nIf you need any more convincing to take the native plant path, then consider that they require significantly less maintenance than a standard monoculture lawn. That means no need to get the lawnmower out every couple of weeks. Native plants aren't as thirsty as grass, which means you'll save money on your water bill.\n🗣️ Should we be actively working to kill invasive species? 🔘 Absolutely 💯 🔘 It depends on the species 🤔 🔘 I don't know 🤷 🔘 No — leave nature alone 🙅 🗳️ Click your choice to see results and speak your mind The Mishawaka community knows all about the benefits native plants can bring. It won't be long until the hard work pays off.\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",
