    "text": "Il forte maltempo che ieri sera si è abbattuto sul Veneto ha costretto i Vigili del Fuoco ad effettuare 135 interventi . Particolarmente colpite le province di Treviso dove sono stati svolti 60 interventi, Vicenza (30 interventi), Padova (25) e Venezia (20). Le squadre dei comandi hanno lavorato tutta la notte per alberi abbattuti, danni d’acqua e allagamenti.\nIn Friuli Venezia Giulia, il vento forte che ieri sera ha sferzato Trieste ha causato la rottura degli ormeggi di tre navi mercantili nel porto, secondo quanto reso noto dalla Capitaneria di porto – Guardia Costiera di Trieste. Le raffiche hanno raggiunto picchi di 8 0km/h.\n“ L’equipaggio della nave K-Stream – fa sapere la Capitaneria in una nota – ha risolto in autonomia la situazione, rinforzando gli ormeggi e rimanendo in banchina. La nave Ulusoy-14 è riuscita ad accendere i motori e, con pilota a bordo, a dare fonda all’ancora. Situazione più critica per la nave Maersk Hidalgo, risolta con l’intervento di rimorchiatori, ormeggiatori e piloti, grazie ai quali è stata ricondotta in sicurezza presso il proprio ormeggio “.\nUna motovedetta della Guardia Costiera è intervenuta anche per sgomberare il molo Audace, nel centro cittadino, gremito di gente nonostante le onde alte e il vento forte.\nANALISI E SITUAZIONE Maltempo, violenti temporali al Nord-Est: nubifragi, grandine e forte vento in Veneto | FOTO e VIDEO\nPer monitorare nel modo migliore possibile la situazione meteo in tempo reale, di seguito forniamo un elenco delle pagine con tutte le informazioni utili per seguire il nowcasting meteorologico minuto per minuto:\nSatelliti Satelliti Animati Situazione Fulminazioni Radar Di seguito i link per l’accesso diretto alle pagine con le previsioni meteo, particolarmente accurate nei dettagli, per le aree geografiche d’Italia (link sempre raggiungibili anche dal Menù in alto in tutte le pagine del sito):\nNord Italia Centro Italia Sud e Isole Le Previsioni Meteo Regione per Regione: Lombardia Lazio Campania Veneto Sicilia Emilia Romagna Piemonte Puglia Toscana Calabria Sardegna Liguria Marche Abruzzo Friuli Venezia Giulia Trentino Alto Adige Umbria Basilicata Molise Valle d’Aosta",

    "text": "Conditions were mostly nice this year for travelers flying ahead of and on Christmas, but some naughty disruptions again plagued those flying with Southwest Airlines. For millions of people traveling over the holiday, this year was much better than last. Christmas morning put a bow on a relatively smooth weekend. Only 157 flights within, into or out of the U.S. had been canceled and 2,111 were delayed as of late afternoon on Monday, according to the tracking website FlightAware. For this holiday season, U.S. airlines prepared for massive waves of travelers by hiring thousands of pilots, flight attendants and other workers — in an effort to avoid the delays and cancellations that marred travel in 2022, culminating with the Southwest Airlines debacle that stranded more than 2 million people. People are also reading… Still, Southwest experienced hiccups again over the weekend that the airline was looking to clear by Monday. Check out how airline performance has been recently at North Carolina airports.",

    "title": "'Manhunt,' about hunt for John Wilkes Booth, may make you wish you paid attention in history class - Japan Today",
    "text": "A new series transforms the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln into a true crime thriller that goes deeper into the story than most textbooks.\nMost who studied Lincoln in school learn he was assassinated by a man named John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln was watching a play with his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, at Ford's Theatre when Booth came from behind and shot him.\nWhat isn't as widely remembered is that Booth killed the president just five days after the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee effectively ended the Civil War. It was a pre-planned, coordinated attack on the president, Vice President Andrew Johnson and the Secretary of State. Only Booth was successful.\nA Confederate sympathizer, Booth relied on a network of supporters to help him hide. Edwin Stanton, the Secretary of War, led the search by the Army to track Lincoln's killer down. He was found 12 days later hiding in a barn where he was shot and killed.\n“ Manhunt,\" debuting Friday on Apple TV+, dramatizes the hunt for Booth and the trial that followed. It’s based on the book “Manhunt: The 12-Day Chance for Lincoln’s Killer” by James L. Swanson. Tobias Menzies stars as Stanton, who also helped convict Booth's conspirators.\n“Most no one knows the details of this story unless they’ve done a Ph.D or it’s a special interest of theirs,” said creator- showrunner Monica Beletsky in a recent interview.\nBringing Stanton to life is exciting, said Menzies, because he had a close, respected relationship with Lincoln.\n“A big part of Stanton’s journey is both a political loss and also a personal loss. He loses a friend. ... I studied very little American history, and I certainly didn’t do this period of history,” said Menzies. “As an actor, I’ve done quite a lot of period stuff and I find it enjoyable to get the chance to find out about a new part of these stories and this is a really good example of that.\n\"Truth is stranger than fiction.”\nAnthony Boyle plays Booth and his awareness of the man began with an episode of “The Simpsons” where Bart portrayed him in a school play. He knew his research needed to dig deeper to understand Booth's psyche and read letters he had written between the ages of 15 until his death at 26. Boyle describes them as a “descent into madness.”\nBeletsky hopes “Manhunt” underscores how Lincoln's killing was especially shocking at the time.\n“That kind of murder was so uncommon,” she said. “Lincoln famously left the White House door unlocked during the Civil War, even though he had piles of death threats. It wasn’t even imagined that kind of crime could happen in our culture. My costume designer told me that Booth, wearing all black that night, is the origin of villains wearing all black in our storytelling.”\nThere was a boldness and conceit to the way Booth decided to kill Lincoln so publicly in front of an audience that fit his desire for attention.\n“The theater was absolutely jammed,” said Menzies, a British actor who's starred in “The Crown\" and “Outlander.” “And then to run out and disappear into the night and then take 12 days to find this man, you couldn't make it up.”\nBooth was an actor in a family of actors, but lived in the shadow of his older brother Edwin, who was well-respected for his talent. “I'm gonna be the most famous man in the whole world,” Booth says on the show, prior to the assassination. While on the run, he reads newspaper articles about himself and loves the attention.\n“It was like, Leonardo DiCaprio’s brother killed the president,\" said Hamish Linklater, who plays Lincoln. \"I mean, (Edwin) was the biggest celebrity of his time,\" he said.\n“This was before the internet and before television, this was word of mouth,\" added Boyle. \"People were hearing about it (asking), ”John Wilkes Booth, the actor, killed the President? Was this some sort of farce?”\nBesides telling Stanton's story, Beletsky introduces viewers to Mary Simms, a slave belonging to a physician named Dr. Samuel Mudd, (played by Matt Walsh), who treated Booth while he was on the run. She was freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. The series depicts Simms — played by Lovie Simone— as interacting with Booth when he shows up at Mudd's house to hide, but in reality, she never met him.\nSimms went on to testify in the trial of Booth's conspirators — which included Mudd — and confirmed his allegiance to the Confederacy. Because there is not a lot of information available on Simms, she was written as a composite of a number of people who helped to convict Booth's co-conspirators.\n“It was a real opportunity to bring some of these heroes to light, like Stanton and Simms, and also to sort of set the record straight in some ways of what happened in our past and how that still continues to affect us,\" said Beletsky.\n“It feels like a good time to be telling this story. You know, there is a big election coming up in November. Our story is partly a story about the fragility of democracy to some extent,\" Menzies said. “I think that’s as true now as it was then. It has a relevance and a resonance which feels kind of rich to be telling now.”",
