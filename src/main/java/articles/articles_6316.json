    "text": "Posted Feb 29, 2024 03:48:26 PM. Last Updated Feb 29, 2024 03:48:31 PM. The Ontario Senior Achievement Awards recognize 20 seniors each year for their contributions to communities across the province. The awards are given out by the Minister for Seniors and Accessibility, Raymond Cho and Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Edith Dumont. “Thank you for showing us that one is never too old to make a difference in the lives of others,” said Cho. “They have given generously their wisdom and experience in making their communities, Canada and the world a better place to live.” One of those seniors is from Waterloo Region, volunteering with a local charity called Strong Start. Strong Start first launched with its pilot program in 2001. It aims to help children in Ontario learn to read, helping any child that may be falling behind improve their literacy skills. Howlett received the award for his volunteer work where he developed the charities website and volunteer portal which has helped thousands of children. Howlett was recognized for bringing his skills in technology together with the charity to improve their services. In 2020, Strong Start introduced the Chris Howlett Award in recognition of his contributions. Howlett’s most recent accomplishment was creating a volunteer information portal that connects trained volunteers with schools in need. When he first started working with the charity in 2010, they had already helped about 10,000 children improve their literacy. Since then that number has grown to over 56,000 children. Howlett received his award during the ceremony that took place at Queen’s Park in Toronto Feb. 29 inside the Lieutenant Governor’s Suite. The first Ontario Senior Achievement Awards ceremony took place back in 1986. It honours individuals aged 65 or older for their volunteer work and other contributions that benefitted the communities they live in. “Together you have had a tremendous positive impact on just about every aspect of life in Ontario. You have helped conserve the environment and have improved the quality of life in cities and communities,” said Dumont during the ceremony. By next year, the province is estimating the population of people 65-years or older will grow to 3 million people and become the fastest growing demographic group.",

С мальчиком побеседовал инспектор по делам несовершеннолетних, разъяснив недопустимость подобного поведения.\nВ отношении родителя составлен административный протокол по ч. 1 статьи 5.35 КоАП РФ за ненадлежащее исполнение обязанностей по воспитанию ребёнка.\nНапомним, в конце мая в Артёме двое несовершеннолетних попытались поджечь палку от Вечного огня.

    "text": "Sui, a decentralized layer-1 blockchain designed for swift smart contract deployment, faced a significant outage on Nov. 21, halting block production for over an hour.\nAccording to data from the Sui Network explorer, SuiVision, no blocks were produced after 9:15 a.m. UTC, marking a serious disruption.\nIndustry reactions Observers quickly weighed in on the downtime, with some noting Sui’s aspirations to rival Solana, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n“SUI blockchain is down. And they claimed to be a Solana Killer,” crypto YouTuber Ajay Kashyap commented on X.\nImpact on SUI token and exchanges The outage also affected SUI, the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, which dropped nearly 11%, trading at approximately $3.40.\nDespite the decline, SUI remained up 75% over the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko data.\nSome exchanges responded to the disruption, with South Korean platform Upbit temporarily suspending SUI deposits and withdrawals, citing network issues.\nSui Foundation addresses the issue Roughly two hours after the block production halt, the Sui Foundation acknowledged the problem on X, stating, “We’ve identified the issue, and a fix will be deployed shortly.”\nPossible cause: A DOS bug Web3 security firm ExVul suggested a denial-of-service (DOS) bug might have caused the outage.\n“After our analysis, it was found that the Sui Network node occurred DOS due to integer overflow,” ExVul wrote in an X post.\nMoving forward The outage has raised questions about the reliability of Sui as it aims to compete with established networks like Solana.\nObservers will be watching closely as the blockchain works to resolve the issue and restore confidence in its system.",

    "title": "5 Stages A Narcissist Goes Through When You Break-Up With Them | Times Now",
    "text": "Breaking up with a narcissist is very different from ending a relationship with a typical person. Narcissists see relationships as a way to get admiration and maintain control, so a breakup can seriously hurt their pride. They often go through specific stages that show their strong need for attention and power. In this article, we will discuss the five stages a narcissist goes through when you separate from them. Stage 1: They become the eternal victim - Once you leave them, they fabricate a web of lies. They weave a narrative, and each part of it is based on their distorted perception of reality. To everyone they meet, they play the victim with one purpose: to make you look like the villain. The narcissist never takes a step back to consider the role they played in creating the situation they now pretend to cry about. They never miss or grieve you, and they never feel remorse or think they should have treated you better. Stage 2: They make you jealous - A narcissist depends on you more than you depend on them. They are more affected by your life than you are by theirs. To keep you hooked and hurt, they post pictures with their new supply online, ensuring you see them. They do this to trigger chronic self-doubt and make you ask questions like, \\\"Was I not enough? Why do they look so happy with this new person? Does that mean this new person is better, offering everything the narcissist needed, and I was a failure?\\\" The narcissist tries to stay involved in your life more than in the life they seem to be building with this new supply. They do not like to be ignored or forgotten. Stage 3: They start hoovering - They begin hoovering and might try to win you back. A narcissist cannot stand to see you moving on, breaking free, and starting to thrive. Their main goal is to make you suffer because that makes them feel powerful and in control. You might get a message from them on your birthday, the anniversary of no contact, or any other significant day — a milestone. Then the narcissist shows up, attempting to pull you back in, trigger regression, and make you lose all your progress by reinitiating contact and going through the same cycle once again. Hoovering is their last attempt to re-establish control. Stage 4: They run a massive smear campaign - When a narcissist can no longer control you directly, they will try to control how other people see you. They will reach out to your friends and family, spreading lie after lie to isolate you and bring as many people as possible to their side. When this starts happening, know that you have already won. They are desperate and helpless. They know they cannot get a hold of you, and their actions are a testament to their loss of control. This desperation is a clear indication that you are no longer within their grasp — emotionally or mentally. Stage 5: They repeat the cycle - In this final stage, the narcissist inevitably repeats the cycle with someone new, leaving a trail of emotional destruction in their wake. They move on, not to find a genuine connection or stability, but to seek a new person who can fulfill their endless need for attention and validation. The narcissist's inability to maintain stable, loving relationships becomes glaringly evident as they shift their focus to a new target. Each relationship is merely a reflection of the previous one, characterized by the same deceit, emotional exploitation, and eventual abandonment.

    "text": "Por fin 2023 nos trae una buena noticia, se ha hecho esperar pero ya tenemos la buena noticia del año: que se acaba. La mejor noticia de 2023 es que por fin se acaba, que en dos días despediremos un año abundante en malas noticias. No es que por una vez esté de acuerdo con Feijóo y piense que este año “han ocurrido todas las indignidades imaginables a la vez”; pero basta hacer memoria o leer los resúmenes anuales que estos días publican los medios, y está claro: ha sido un año de mierda. No ya es que en 2023 volviese a ser, parafraseando al Colectivo Todoazen, “el año que tampoco hicimos la revolución”. Es que nos contentamos con haber sobrevivido a doce meses de sustos y destrozos. La guerra en Gaza –que ya ha superado los 21.000 muertos– sin haber terminado la de Ucrania –estancada y acumulando muertos, destrucción y dinero de occidente en armamento–; los nuevos avances de la ultraderecha en el mundo –con Milei a la cabeza en Argentina–; el planeta batiendo récords históricos de temperatura mes a mes y estación a estación; la cumbre del clima que no sirvió para gran cosa mientras seguimos cruzando líneas rojas en la crisis climática. Y en España, la ultraderecha entrando en gobiernos municipales y autonómicos, imponiendo su agenda en materia de derechos sociales y cultura, a la vez que ocupando las calles en las protestas contra la amnistía.\nMe propuse terminar el año, igual que el anterior, recopilando las buenas noticias que también ha habido y que pasan desapercibidas o se olvidan bajo la impresión de año nefasto. Pero por más que lo he intentado, no he encontrado muchos motivos para la esperanza en este 2023. Así que he preguntado a gente de mi entorno, a ver si recuerdan cosas buenas que también hayan pasado este año, y nos quitamos entre todos el mal sabor de boca. Me ha salido un artículo colaborativo, ahí van algunas buenas noticias que me han recordado amigas y amigos a los que nombraré en agradecimiento:\nEl freno a la derecha y la ultraderecha el 23-J es la buena noticia más repetida: esa bala que nos pasó rozando, faltaron unos pocos miles de votos para que hoy Abascal fuera vicepresidente del Gobierno, y quién sabe si el matón Ortega Smith tendría también un ministerio. Que la sociedad española se movilizase contra los sondeos y contra el fatalismo, y consiguiera revertir la tendencia mundial al ascenso ultra, es la noticia del año para la ciudadanía de izquierda.\nJunto a ello, que finalmente haya un gobierno progresista, con todas sus dificultades, y el mantenimiento de las principales medidas del escudo social, salva un poco el mal año político. El uso de las lenguas cooficiales en el Congreso fue también un avance, me recuerda Marta. Y algunas medidas que sí salieron este año, como las bajas para las menstruaciones dolorosas, que recuerda Elena; o la ley de bienestar animal, que persigue el maltrato a los animales, y que está entre lo mejor del año para Marta y Victoria.\nLo mismo con la guerra de Gaza: el reverso positivo de la mala noticia del año es la movilización ciudadana en todo el mundo, mayoritaria en señalar los crímenes de Israel y en solidarizarse con el pueblo palestino. A la agenda internacional añade Marta los procesos contra Trump en Estados Unidos, y José Manuel tiene un recuerdo para los ecuatorianos, que en referéndum decidieron proteger dos zonas naturales frente a petroleras y minería.\nTambién hubo buenas noticias en materia de memoria democrática: Paco me recuerda lo avanzado en las exhumaciones del Valle de Cuelgamuros, donde han encontrado restos de republicanos y con material genético viable para identificarlos. Paqui destaca que concluyese la exhumación de la fosa de Pico Reja en el cementerio de Sevilla, y Ricardo la inauguración del monumento a las víctimas en la misma fosa. Además, Joaquín recuerda cómo se localizó al asesino de Arturo Ruiz en Buenos Aires.\nLa victoria doble de la selección femenina de fútbol, ganando el mundial y logrando con el apoyo ciudadano echar a Rubiales, es una gran noticia para Marta, Antonio o Elena. José Antonio se acordó de ese instituto del Raval barcelonés, el Miquel Tarradell, modélico en su ambiente escolar y en sus resultados académicos teniendo un 95% de alumnado inmigrante, un buen argumento contra la agenda racista de la ultraderecha.\nEn Andalucía se creó el sindicato andaluz de Kellys, recuerda Charo. En Córdoba, Fabio señala la lucha de familias, profesorado y barrios que ha conseguido que el ayuntamiento dé marcha atrás en su intención de externalizar las plazas de portería de los colegios con seguridad privada. En Cádiz, recuerda Joaquín, la empresa concesionaria de la Ayuda a Domicilio fue condenada a pagar 60.000 euros a 25 trabajadoras. Y el Supremo reconoció a las parejas de hecho con familia numerosa los mismos derechos que a los matrimonios, gracias al abogado Luis Ocaña.\nJesús mira a los trabajadores suecos en su lucha contra Tesla; y Virginia a los docentes marroquíes, en huelga por la mejora de sus salarios, y cómo su lucha se va extendiendo a otros colectivos como funcionarios municipales o la sanidad pública de Marruecos. Alfons cuenta cómo los comercios de su pueblo valenciano han resistido a la pandemia y a la despoblación. José Manuel se acuerda de los 50 años de la cabalgata participativa de Hortaleza. Marta destaca la apertura de la encomienda cooperativa La Manuela en Villamartín (Sevilla). Y Olga reivindica la fuerza del colectivo DIME, de Docentes por la Inclusión y la Mejora Educativa, que están haciendo un importante trabajo.\nLa ciencia siempre deja buenas noticias: Marta recuerda el medicamento contra varios tipos de cáncer desarrollado por un científico español, Asier Unciti; o los ensayos clínicos exitosos en dos nuevos medicamentos para tratar el Alzheimer. Valle me cuenta que una científica vasca ha desarrollado junto a su equipo un sistema para detectar las fugas de metano en la industria fósil, y subraya la reducción en la deforestación en la Amazonia. Para José Antonio la buena noticia es que doce países africanos puedan recibir la primera vacuna contra la malaria, que podría salvar la vida de miles de niños. Y Juan recuerda que la OMS dio por acabada la pandemia de COVID.\nMarta añade una noticia cultural: el estreno de la película Creatura , que normaliza el placer femenino. Y Azahara celebra que haya sido el año de menor consumo televisivo en España.\nSeguro que hay muchas más buenas noticias. Si te acuerdas, puedes dejarlas en los comentarios, a ver si entre todos nos quitamos el mal sabor, y concluimos que ha sido un mal año, sí, incluso un muy mal año, pero lleno de buenas noticias. Venga, dime algo bueno del 2023.",
