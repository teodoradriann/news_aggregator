    "text": "Your AI-Trained Oncology Knowledge Connection!\nNews\nArticle\nPacritinib was active and safe in patients with multi-refractory chronic graft-vs-host disease.\nPacritinib (Vonjo) demonstrated preliminary efficacy with an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with multi-refractory chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGVHD), according to data from a phase 1 study (NCT05531786) presented at the 51st Annual EBMT Meeting.1\nAt a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 8-20.3), the agent elicited an overall response rate (ORR) of 67% at 6 months, with 4 patients experiencing partial responses (PRs) and 2 achieving stable disease (SD). The treatment was found to be tolerable with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) reported. Only 1 patient experienced grade 3 or higher arthralgia, which was not determined to be related to study treatment.\n“Pacritinib, an oral CSF1R/JAK2/IRAK1 inhibitor, has shown a favorable safety profile with promising response rates in [patients with] multi-refractory severe cGVHD at the initial dose level,” Noa G. Holtzman, MD, of University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center, in Florida, and colleagues, wrote in a poster. “Accrual for dose level 2 [DL2] is ongoing.”\nPacritinib targets CSF1R, JAK2, and IRAK1, which are important inflammatory and fibrotic pathways associated with GVHD pathophysiology. The agent received accelerated approval from the FDA in February 2022 for use in adult patients with intermediate- or high-risk primary or secondary myelofibrosis with a platelet count under 50 × 109/L.2 Investigators hypothesized that pacritinib could potentially be an effective option against severe cGVHD—one that would not lead to dose-limiting cytopenias.1 To this end, they launched a phase 1 study to further explore this agent in this population.\nThe modified dose-escalation study, which was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, enrolled patients with moderate or severe cGVHD who did not respond to at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy.3 Patients were required to be at least 18 years of age, have a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60%, and have acceptable organ and bone marrow function.\nStudy participants received pacritinib at 100 mg twice daily (dose level 1; DL1) or 200 mg twice daily (DL2) on days 1 to 28 of a 28-day treatment cycle.1 Treatment continued for up to 1 year if PR or SD was achieved. Accrual to DL1 has been completed, and accrual for DL2 is still underway. Investigators monitored adverse effects (AEs) and conducted clinical response assessments after 6 weeks, and then 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment in accordance with the 2014 National Institutes of Health cGVHD Response Criteria.\nIn phase 1, the primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose after DLT. Secondary efficacy end points comprised 6-month ORR. Investigators also examined patient-reported outcomes (PROs). At the time of data cutoff, half of patients had completed 12 months of treatment.\nAt the time of data cutoff, 7 patients had been enrolled to the trial and 6 had received treatment. The mean patient age was 44 years (range, 27-69), and most patients were male (83%) and Caucasian (67%). The median time from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to study enrollment was 5.4 years (range, 4.1-12.3), and the median time from cGVHD diagnosis to study enrollment was 3.4 years (range, 2.2-7.5). All patients had severe cGVHD with a median of 3 organs involved. The median prior number of therapies received was 6 (range, 2-9); all patients had received steroids, and 83% received ruxolitinib (Jakafi)/belumosudil (Rezurock).\nWith regard to PROs, 60% of patients were noted to have a meaningful decrease of 7 or more points in the Lee Symptom Scale.\nIn terms of safety, the most common grade 2 or higher AEs experienced at DL1 were upper respiratory infection (n = 5), dyspepsia (n = 2), abdominal pain, increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, infective conjunctivitis, dysgeusia, decreased ejection fraction, eye disorders, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia (n = 1, each).\n“Treatment was tolerated well without any early treatment discontinuation or dose [reductions], and there have been no cases of relapse or death,” study authors concluded.",

    "text": "HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Authorities in Harris County are warning everyone not to drink and drive this New Year's holiday weekend. The Harris County Sheriff's Office announced its plans on Thursday to pull over intoxicated or impaired drivers under a \"No Refusal DWI Initiative\" ahead of the end-of-year celebrations. Drivers will not be allowed to refuse a blood alcohol test if they are suspected of being impaired. Checkpoints will be set up across Harris County starting Friday night. This is something officials do every year just in time for the holidays. Last year's efforts yielded 42 DWI arrests and 18 additional non-DWI arrests. SEE PREVIOUS REPORT: Houston police warn against DWI and celebratory gunfire ahead of New Year's Eve Harris County has one of the highest rates of deadly DWI crashes in the country. According to TxDOT, the county had 148 people killed in DUI crashes in 2022. Statewide, more than 1,000 people died in crashes that involved impaired drivers. During Thursday's press conference, the family of Deputy Jennifer Chavis, who was killed by a suspected drunk driver in 2022 , reminded everyone that each one of those is more than just a number. \"When we talk about realities, this is the reality of drunk driving that you see before you,\" Chavis' sister said. \"We and their family as well stand before you with pictures because that's all that we have left.\" HPD Chief Troy Finner also attended Thursday's meeting, saying these incidents are \"100% preventable.\" \"And that's what's so frustrating, because we come time and time again - and Harris County time and time again leads the nation in DWI-related deaths,\" he continued. \"Because you don't want to be in jail, but we're going to be out there. And most importantly - we don't want to see any more victims.\" SEE ALSO: House Bill 393 was passed earlier this year , which requires drunk drivers to pay child support if they kill a child's guardian. If the driver is convicted of intoxication manslaughter, they will have to make payments to the child until they turn 18 years old or graduate from high school. If you're celebrating this New Year's Eve, you are asked to plan ahead. Set up a ride home with a sober friend, family member, or rideshare service. Or, stay put until you're sober.",
