    "title": "Inside Duke's Blue Crew, the student-run club building community and spirit at women's sporting events",
    "text": "As the music built up in Cameron Indoor Stadium Nov. 3, the Duke volleyball starting lineup sprinted onto the court, stopping momentarily to throw small volleyballs into the scattered crowd. Sophomore Amiah Burgess stood in the corner with two bags full of boom sticks — large, Duke blue cylinders. When the Blue Devils attacked Clemson in the first set, Burgess traversed through the crowd, handing boom sticks to the families and children lining the bleachers. After the Blue Devils scored, the stadium erupted with cheers and the hollow noise of the boom stick, producing twice the noise expected of a crowd of 653 attendees.\nOn Feb. 25, Duke baseball capped off its series against Northwestern in front of 793 attendees. A week later, future Women’s College World Series participants Duke softball bested Syracuse to a crowd of 390 attendees. On Feb. 29, Duke women’s basketball defeated Virginia, playing for 2,005 attendees. The day before, the men’s team conquered Louisville in front of 9,314 attendees.\nTwenty-seven of the 36 Blue Devils with individual NCAA Championship appearances were women. Ten of the 17 teams ranked in the top 25 for the 2023-24 season were women’s sports. Despite the success of female athletes and sports at Duke, they don’t often get the same crowd support as the men.\nEnter Blue Crew. Founded by sophomores Burgess and Ava Littman, the club's idea was sparked by a Writing 101 final paper for the class Women, Leadership and Purpose. The question prompted Littman and Burgess to think about what they would change about Duke or anything to do with women.\nThe sophomore duo had two distinct answers in their papers.\n“We both wrote our final papers about women’s sports. Hers was more from the perspective of an athlete, and then mine was more from the perspective of a fan,” Littman said. “It was basically just about how women could feel more comfortable in the sports space from the perspective of fans and the business perspective. One of the things [Burgess] talked about in hers was Blue Crew.\"\nExcited about her first year as a student-athlete on the Blue Devils’ history-making softball team, Burgess was inspired by her experience.\n“We knew what kind of season we were gonna have before we had even come together. So, knowing that, I was like … it’s gonna be such a good season for us, and I feel like people at Duke should experience that,” Burgess said.\nBut, why aren’t they?\nBurgess asked and answered the same question for her paper, concluding that it wasn’t a matter of attendance but rather organization.\n“[Football and basketball] have designated student sections,” Burgess said. “Everyone sits on the wooden benches, and at football you have those color-coded tickets. For women’s games, they don’t do that.”\nSeeing fans at games encourages more to come. Blue Crew brings fans, posters and a sense of community. By creating a community for women’s athletes and fans of women's sports, it gives curious students and potential fans friendships between one another and the athletes they support. These friendships are the foundation of the organization, as Burgess was inspired by her own experience.\n“My freshman year experience was a little bit different from a lot of student-athletes here because there were only two of us in our class … and you’re living on East Campus,” Burgess said. “So it was that isolation that was almost like, ‘we have to make other friends’ … and that was one of the best things we had ever done.\"\nBurgess described those friends as “some of the most loyal people to show out for us.”\nFor Blue Crew, game day doesn’t start at kickoff or faceoff; outreach begins long before. Blue Crew coordinates with a team representative about which games they would like for the club to attend. From there, the work begins, as the club gathers materials for the game, tables at the Bryan Center Plaza and blasts out promotional materials on social media. On game day, Blue Crew comes prepared with posters, boom sticks and energy to support the athletes.\n“We’re still ironing out what’s a good time to come. When will students show up? When will students leave?” Burgess said.\nAs of right now, Blue Crew takes two different approaches. In some games, Blue Crew organizes the student sections, getting the fans to sit together. For other ones, Blue Crew focuses more on increasing attendance, with a long term goal of consistent support.\n“Once we have a consistent flow of people going to those events, it’s going to be more of the organizing size where we’re leading cheers [and] getting everyone to sit together,” Littman said.\nThe future only holds bigger and better things for Blue Crew, as they continue to foster community between athletes and non-athletes. They are toying with the ideas of movie nights and open scrimmages, all with the goal of fostering community and building engagement with women’s sports on this campus.\nNow, as Burgess sat in Cameron Indoor Stadium, she watched two children stumble up the steps. They paused momentarily and gazed at the Blue Crew signs scattered on the bleachers.\n“Do you guys want to hold a sign up?” asked a Blue Crew member.\nThey nodded their heads vigorously and outstretched their hands for the “Let’s Go Duke” and the “Blue Crew at Work” signs. After the children ran up the bleachers with their posters, they turned toward the game and began screaming for Duke volleyball. As they screamed, Burgess rushed for the bag with the boom sticks and handed a pair to the children, who added to the symphony of the crowd.\nEditor's note: Sophomore Ava Littman, who is a co-founder of Blue Crew, is an associate news editor of The Chronicle’s 120th volume.\nGet The Chronicle straight to your inbox\nSignup for our weekly newsletter.

Those companies are serious about hiring.\nAccording to an article in Bonnie Dilber, a recruiting manager with 9 years of experience, companies that post jobs at the end of the year are serious about filling them. This means they will move quickly and prioritize a more efficient hiring process. Despite the challenges of scheduling interviews and managing the hiring process during the holiday season, companies posting jobs in December and January are in urgent need of filling the roles.\nChallenges of hiring at the end of the year\nEnd-of-year hiring poses challenges such as scheduling interviews around holiday schedules and planned time off for both applicants and hiring teams. Many employed individuals are not interested in pursuing new jobs at this time due to potential interference with their bonuses. Hiring managers and recruiting teams may want to wait until after the new year to post jobs, but those who do post jobs in December are facing urgency in filling the roles.\nJobs posted in January are also worth applying for\nCompanies that post jobs in January are often in urgent need of filling roles, which they couldn’t manage hiring for during the winter holidays. Hiring managers may schedule multiple interviews at once, review resumes themselves, and skip recruiter screens to speed up the hiring process.\nPhoto Credit: i.insider.com",

(WCJB) - Members of North Central Florida Fire Rescue are currently assisting with rescue efforts in Texas, following severe flooding.\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis authorized the deployment of six members from Florida Task Force Eight, including teams from Gainesville, Ocala, and Marion County Fire Rescue.\nAmong the team is District Chief Devin Chapman from Gainesville Fire Rescue.\nDeSantis emphasized the state’s search and rescue capabilities.\n“Florida has a robust search and rescue system where we take care of a lot of our own emergencies, we want to be on the ground immediately for our citizens and be able to take care of them,” DeSantis said. “But also, when we can, we will reach out to other communities and assist them, and we have a history of doing that.”\nThis week, Task Force Eight was dispatched to areas where flash floods have submerged roadways and overwhelmed drainage systems.\nClick here to subscribe to our newsletter.\nCopyright 2025 WCJB.

    "text": "A solar storm revealed the magical illumination of the Northern Lights across the United States on Thursday evening as the celestial event struck Earth.\nThe Northern Lights – also known as the aurora borealis – are a natural light phenomenon in the night sky that is most commonly observed in the aurora zone – an area within 2,500 kilometers of the North Pole.\nThe phenomenon occurs when charged particles from the sun collide directly into the Earth’s magnetic field. The reaction transforms the dark sky into one that glows vibrantly with swirling curtains of colored light, including green, pink, red, yellow, blue and violet.\nNormally the lights can only be seen in areas such as Scandinavia, Alaska and Iceland. But the timing of Thursday’s solar storm provided a beautiful show not only for Europe, but also for North America.\nThe Northern Lights were seen Thursday evening in Key Largo, Florida\nA user on\nNew York City was able to catch a glimpse of the colored spot in the night sky.\nOn social media, people as far south as Washington DC and Kentucky could also witness the neon pink and hazy purple skies, The New York Times reported.\n“I’m just shocked that it took my whole life to see it,” Gabriela Aguilar, a 37-year-old New Yorker, told The New York Times.\nAs she stepped onto the roof of her Harlem apartment building with her dog, she saw the sky turn pink, purple and green.\n“And – of all places – to see it in New York City!” she added.\nThe light show started with a solar storm – a sudden explosion of particles, energy, magnetic substances and material blown into the solar system by the sun. NASA reported.\nEarth’s protective magnetic bubble was temporarily disrupted and the fast-moving ejection hit the planet at nearly 1.5 million miles per hour, The Washington Post reported.\nThe Northern Lights were captured in Lexington, Kentucky after the massive solar storm\nA hue of purple and green curtains of light was captured in Zimmerman, Minnesota\nPeople in Salida, Colorado witnessed the pink and purple skies after the solar storm\nWhen the sun’s particles interact with the gases in Earth’s atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen atoms, they release colored lights into the sky at dusk.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classified the recent storm as “severe,” with a four out of five severity rating.\nIf the storm were to expand to “extreme intensity” – a level seen only twice in the past two decades – the display could be seen with the naked eye as far south as Florida.\nThe storm may persist through Friday morning, but is expected to decrease in severity and drop to “strong” or even “moderate” levels.\nThe storm, or coronal mass ejection, produces an influx of energy and particles when it hits Earth.\nThe incident could potentially disrupt power, GPS and communications systems, the New York City Department of Emergency Management said in a post on X.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classified the recent storm as ‘severe’, ranking it a four out of five in severity\nThe storm may persist through Friday morning, but is expected to decrease in severity and drop to ‘strong’ or even ‘moderate’ levels\nNorway is one of the best places in the world to see the Northern Lights as it is located in the heart of the aurora zone in the Norwegian Arctic\nBut despite the disruptions, the department suggested there was no real reason for New Yorkers to worry.\nThe solar storm hit Earth about 14 hours after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida on Wednesday night, potentially impacting some recovery efforts.\nEmergency measures, including communications systems that rely on satellites in low Earth orbit or high-frequency communications, risk damaging power grids already weakened by the hurricanes and further disrupting navigation systems, The Washington Post said.\nIn previous major solar storms, planes have been diverted due to radio signal interference. Some GPS systems lost their accuracy. Satellites were put into safe mode and successfully deorbited.\nBut NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center has already made contact with several government agencies involved in recovery operations.\nEither way, thousands of Americans were able to witness what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity from the aurora borealis.\nPeople rushed to X to share photos of their thoughts on the rare incident.\nThe photos were taken from dozens of states across the country and each one appears to look slightly different, but no less beautiful, than the last.",

    "text": "The National Communications Officer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Sammy Gyamfi, has stated that the investigations into the Airbus deal were solely initiated because former President John Mahama and his brother, Samuel Foster Adam, were linked to it.\nAccording to him, the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) saw it as an opportunity to tarnish Mr Mahama’s reputation.\nHe argued that the former Special Prosecutor, Martin Amidu once alleged that President Akufo-Addo was mounting pressure on him to indict the NDC flagbearer.\nSpeaking on Joy FM’s Top Story, he explained that this was the NPP’s attempt to promote the propaganda that Mahama is not fit to run for office again, alleging that during his term as Vice President, he awarded contracts to his brother.\nMr Gyamfi told the host that candidate Mahama is clean and incorruptible, and the Office of the Special Prosecutor has only enhanced his image publicly.\nRead also : Airbus bribery scandal: John Mahama is ‘Government Official 1’ but… – OSP “Martin Amidu, the first special prosecutor actually came out to say that there was incessant pressure on him from President Akufo-Addo for him to indict John Mahama at all cost relative to this airbus matters.\n“It’s been clear from day one that the NPP had an evil agenda to smear Mahama with lies that have been exposed. John Mahama’s innocence is vindicated and today he stands squeaky clean as an incorruptible leader, seven and half years after leaving office,” he said on August 8.\nRead also : Airbus bribery scandal: Once again, John Mahama has been vindicated – Sammy Gyamfi The Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) named former President John Dramani Mahama as the individual referenced as ‘Government official 1’ in the Airbus bribery scandal, but said there is no evidence to show that he was paid any bribes.\nThis conclusion, according to the Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng, follows an extensive investigation spanning four years by his office.\nAddressing the media in Accra, Mr Agyebeng explained that the investigation into the scandal and the revelation of the identities of the persons involved were necessary due to the public interest in the issue.\nThe NDC’s National Communicator explained that Mr Mahama had no intention of awarding contracts to his brother.\nHowever, Mr Adam and his associates were introduced in the Airbus deal as intermediaries after the government had agreed to the purchase. As the Special Prosecutor put it, this “was a case of a lacklustre coincidence.”",

    "text": "A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river. Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said. Chris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane. The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said. It came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said. He and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said. Police said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment. Mr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards. “They were part of an off-road club. “I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up. “You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water. “I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.” Two other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help. They said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident. Mrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions. The area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.” A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous. “Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale. “There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm. “Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety. “The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary. “Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.” Witnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.

    "title": "El sueldo de los funcionarios subirá en 2024 hasta un 2,5% | Andalucía Información. Todas las noticias de Cádiz",
    "text": "El salario de los más de 3,5 millones de empleados públicos subirá en un porcentaje fijo del 2% con la llegada de 2024, que podrá elevarse en otro 0,5% adicional en función de la evolución del IPC armonizado (IPCA). Así lo pactaron Gobierno, CCOO y UGT en el 'Acuerdo Marco para una Administración del siglo XXI' firmado en octubre de 2022 y en el que se contemplaba una subida salarial para el conjunto de los tres años de hasta un 9,5%. En concreto, el texto del acuerdo contempla para el nuevo año un incremento salarial fijo del 2% sobre la base de las retribuciones ya incrementadas en el ejercicio anterior. Adicionalmente, si la suma de la variación del IPCA de los años 2022-2024 superara el incremento retributivo fijo acumulado de esos mismos ejercicios, se aplicará un incremento retributivo adicional y consolidable del 0,5%, con efectos desde el 1 de enero de 2024. Los sueldos de los empleados públicos aumentaron en 2022 un 3,5% y, de momento, han subido un 3% en 2023, pues queda pendiente de saber si se les practicará, con carácter retroactivo y consolidable, un alza adicional del 0,5% en caso de que el PIB nominal de 2023 supere el previsto por el Gobierno. Si este dato de PIB, que no se conocerá hasta entrado ya 2024, supera las estimaciones del Ejecutivo, el salario de los empleados públicos habría subido en 2023 otro 3,5%, lo mismo que en 2022, y sobre esa cuantía final de 2023 operará el incremento fijo del 2% acordado para 2024. Fuentes del Ministerio de Hacienda han trasladado a Europa Press que los funcionarios tendrán que esperar, no obstante, hasta el primer trimestre del próximo año para ver actualizadas sus nóminas, una vez que se aprueben los Presupuestos de 2024, puesto que el aumento de sus salarios, al contrario que ha sucedido con las pensiones, no se ha incluido en el decreto-ley de medidas económicas aprobado el día 27 de diciembre. No obstante, las mismas fuentes precisaron que dicha subida se aplicará con carácter retroactivo desde el 1 de enero de 2024, y recuerdan que el Gobierno cerró un acuerdo con los sindicatos, que implica subidas superiores al 9% en tres años (2022, 2023 y 2024) y que \"obviamente\" va a cumplir lo pactado. \"Lo que pactamos se cumple\", han asegurado. El aumento salarial del nuevo año beneficiará a cerca de 3,5 millones de personas que desempeñan su labor en las Administraciones Públicas como funcionarios, personal laboral u otro tipo de asalariados del sector público. La mayoría trabaja para las comunidades autónomas; les siguen por número de personal las entidades locales y la Administración Central. Por otro lado, otras medidas que afectarán a los funcionarios en 2024 están relacionadas con su evaluación de desempeño. Pocos días antes de terminar 2023, el Gobierno introdujo medidas de refuerzo para evaluar el desempeño de todos los empleados públicos. En concreto, éstas entraron en vigor el pasado 21 de diciembre como parte de un Real Decreto-Ley mucho más amplio, de medidas urgentes para la ejecución del Plan de Recuperación. En el Libro II de dicha norma se recogen cambios estructurales en el modelo de la Función Pública, con avances en la planificación estratégica de los recursos humanos y la incorporación de la evaluación del desempeño o nuevos sistemas de acceso. En particular, el texto regula la evaluación del desempeño obligatoria, el procedimiento por el que se valora la conducta profesional y se mide el rendimiento del personal, todo ello con el objetivo mejorar la productividad para, a su vez, mejorar la prestación del servicio público, ha alegado el Gobierno. Dichas evaluaciones \"se plantean en positivo\", según el Ejecutivo, por lo que \"en ningún caso implicarán la pérdida de la condición de funcionario para quienes no las superen\". En el caso de que un empleado público no tengan resultados satisfactorios en las mismas, \"se fomentarán medidas de formación para dotarles de herramientas que les permitan un mejor desempeño\". \"El fomento de la participación y las ofertas constantes de mejora de condiciones se convertirán además en incentivos para que puedan dar la vuelta a esa situación\", según el Ejecutivo. Para quienes superen estas evaluaciones, habrá beneficios directos en distintas variables, como la remuneración del complemento de desempeño, que sustituye al complemento de productividad. Además, se fomentará su progresión en la carrera profesional con la introducción de la carrera horizontal, sistema por el que se pueden mejorar las condiciones sin cambiar de puesto de trabajo. Para ello, se utilizará un sistema de tramos donde se valora la trayectoria, la evaluación del desempeño, la formación o la participación en actividades de docencia o investigación. Todo lo anterior podrá traducirse en una retribución adicional con el complemento de carrera. A esto hay que sumar cambios en el acceso a puestos de alto funcionario \"para que prevalezcan los criterios de mérito y competencia\", según el Gobierno. Entre las novedades de esta norma que entró en vigor hace apenas unos días está la posibilidad de que las plazas no cubiertas tras una convocatoria de oposiciones puedan volver a ofrecerse si no han pasado más de tres años desde la publicación de la oferta. También se establece la posibilidad de que el departamento competente convoque a través de la Secretaría de Estado de Función Pública concursos unitarios abiertos y permanentes para incluir puestos de trabajo vacantes en los distintos ministerios. En lo referido a los procesos de acceso y selección de empleados públicos, el Gobierno impulsa \"un modelo más ágil y eficiente\" con la duración máxima de los procesos selectivos y la territorialización de las pruebas. Para ello, se establecerá obligatoriamente la publicación de convocatorias en el mismo año de la aprobación de la Oferta de Empleo Público, que deberán ejecutarse en un máximo de dos años. El proceso de oposición, además, no podrá durar más de un año. El Gobierno habilitará al Ministerio de Hacienda y Función Pública para elaborar un modelo de bases comunes en los procesos selectivos. Las pruebas para seleccionar a los nuevos integrantes de la Función Pública también serán reformadas, con el objetivo de que el modelo de selección responda a las funciones a desempeñar en los puertos ofertados.
