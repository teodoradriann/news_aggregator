    "text": "Canadians Paralympians strike gold twice, with one bronze on Day 8\nPARIS – Canada earned three medals, with two golds courtesy of two of its biggest names at the Paralympic Games on Day 8.\nWheelchair racer Brent Lakatos earned gold in the men’s T53 800 metres on the track on Thursday, while Aurelie Rivard picked up gold in the women’s S10 400-metre freestyle in the pool. Swimmer Tess Routliffe added bronze in the women’s SB7 100-metre breaststroke.\nFor the 44-year-old Lakatos, it was career medal No. 13 and his first Paralympic gold since the 2016 Games when he won the 100. The Dorval, Que., native won four silvers at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021.\n“It’s a really great feeling,” said Lakatos, who is competing in his fifth Paralympics. “This has taken a lot of planning. The Canadian support staff have been great.\n“We had a great strategy, taking control of the race. We executed the plan and it worked out really well.”\nLakatos now has two medals in Paris, having also taken silver in the 400. But it was a tough road.\n“My training has been modified due to a broken rib,” he said. “But I was able to get back for here and I’m obviously in great shape. I had a stress fracture. I was in really great shape then something started hurting at the very end of May.\n“Luckily I had just enough time to get back, though I missed the whole competition season. That’s why I’ve got no season’s bests.”\nMeanwhile, for the 28-year-old Rivard, it was also career medal No. 13 and her third in Paris. Rivard also earned bronze in the 50 freestlye and silver in the 100 freestyle.\nThe St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., native became the first Canadian swimmer to win a gold medal in the same event in three consecutive Paralympic Games since Stephanie Dixon won the S9 100 backstroke in 2000, 2004, and 2008.\nWhile calling it a surreal moment, Rivard referenced back to her silver in the 100 freestyle, an event she had won gold in at the previous two Paralympics. She was disappointed and even said she thought of going home after it, adding she had not swam that slow in 10 years.\n“I had to find the confidence to show up tonight and deliver,” Rivard said. “It took a lot and I am really proud. I am happy I was able to overcome my fears.”\nFor Routliffe, it was a long time coming after finishing fourth eight years ago at the 2016 Rio Paralympics.\nThe 25-year-old was unable to compete at the Tokyo Games in 2021 due to a back injury as well.\n“It was a good race. I get in the water and I just want to race the person next to me,” Routliffe said. “That’s exactly what I did. I put my heart into that race and I am happy to be on the podium again.\n“Getting on that podium is huge. We’ve been working on that race a lot. Those girls are quick. Just got to get out and race them.”\nIt’s the second medal of these Games for Routliffe, having also earned silver in the SM7 200-metre individual medley.\nIn women’s sitting volleyball, Canada will play Brazil for bronze on Saturday. The Canadians fell 3-0 to China on Thursday in the semifinals.\nCanada’s men’s wheelchair basketball squad will play Germany for bronze on Saturday.\nThe Canadians fell 80-43 to the United States in the semifinals on Thursday. Patrick Anderson paced Canada with 16 points.\nIt’s the first time Canada will play for a medal since winning gold at the 2012 London Games.\nCanada fell 6-1 to Thailand in the bronze-medal game in mixed pairs BC4 boccia action.\nIn judo action, Priscilla Gagne of Sarnia, Ont., lost her bronze-medal match against Argentina’s Paula Karina Gomez.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 5, 2024.",

    "title": "India’s Broadband Subscriptions Drop to 944.4M in September, Marking 2024’s First Decline",
    "text": "\\nBroadband connections in India have dropped by 0.51% to 944.4 million in September 2024, from 949.21 million in August . This is the first time in 2024 that India has seen a decline in broadband connections this year. This loss of connections is coming from a decline in India\\u2019s wireless connection base which went from 906.37 million to 900.77 million. Further, within the wireless connections, mobile connections (phones and dongles) declined by 0.63% going from 905.46 million to 899.79 million in September.\\xa0\n\\nThis decline in subscribers comes after the three major private telcos\\u2014 Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi)\\u2014 increased the prices of their internet plans in July this year. Given that the tariff hike was directed towards mobile connections , this decline in subscribers could be motivated by the higher prices.\\xa0\n\\n \\nOn the other hand, in the fixed wireless segment (like Wi-Fi), connections have increased by 9.01% going from 0.91 million in August to 0.99 million in September. Similarly, wired connections in India also increased by 1.83% going from 42.84 million in August to 43.63 million in September.\\xa0\n\\n Other observations from the data: \\n Jio sees further decline in subscriber base: \\nJio\\u2019s broadband connections have been falling since July. In June, the company had 488.94 million connections, which have since fallen to 477.94 million as of September. Specifically between August and September, the company lost 7.35 million connections. The decline in connections across the past few months is coming from the wireless segment, which, between August and September, fell from 471.75 million to 463.78 million.\\xa0\n\\nIn its most recent earnings call , Jio acknowledged that on a quarterly basis, it has lost about 11 million subscribers as of September 30. The company said that this subscriber decline was nothing unusual with its CFO V Srikanth adding that this was lower than the subscriber decline the company saw in its past tariff hike.\n\\n Airtel and Vi see subscriber increases: \\nWhile all three companies increased prices, Airtel and Vi did not lose broadband connections in September. On the contrary, Airtel\\u2019s connections went from 284.04 million in August to 284.55 million in September, and Vi\\u2019s connection base grew from 125.92 million to 126.36 million.\\xa0\n\\nBetween the two companies, Vi was the only one who experienced a hit because of the tariff hike in the past couple of months. In June, the company used to have 127.82 million connections, however, its connection base dropped to 125.92 by August, only to recover by 0.44 million in September. Just like Jio, Vi has also previously addressed the impact of tariff hikes, stating that its customers have temporarily shifted to BSNL and will return back. \\u201cCustomers who are used to a good coverage, and experience of 4G, probably the current offering of BSNL may not be to that extent,\\u201d Vi\\xa0 CEO Akshay Moondra said in August .\n\\n BSNL benefits from private telcos\\u2019 tariff hike: \\nAs Jio loses its subscriber base, BSNL has been steadily seeing an improvement in wireless connections. Between August and September, BSNL\\u2019s total broadband connection base grew by 1.53 million. The growth in connections is coming from the wireless segment which increased from 32 million to 33.5 million in September.\\xa0\n\\n Airtel maintains a prominent position in the M2M market: \\nAirtel\\u2019s machine-to-machine (M2M) connections stood at 28.44 million in September which is a slight increase of 0.3 million from August. The company maintains a market share of 52.06% followed by Vi, Reliance Jio Infocom Limited and BSNL with a market share of 27.12%, 15.29%, and 5.54% respectively. Total M2M connections in India stood at 54.64 million in September 2024.\\xa0\n\\n \\n Source: TRAI Data\n\\n Also read:\n\\n\\n",

    "text": "TN AG calls for action against sellers of counterfeit, contaminated weight-loss drugs\n“Millions of Americans rely on GLP-1 drugs to improve their health, but bad actors are peddling dangerous fakes.”\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, among other attorneys general, is calling for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take action against the sale of counterfeit and unsafe forms of the weight loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound (GLP-1 drugs).\n“Millions of Americans rely on GLP-1 drugs to improve their health, but bad actors are peddling dangerous fakes,” said AG Skrmetti. “These counterfeit or copycat drugs can be contaminated through shady supply chains running from China, Turkey, and other overseas suppliers, or they can contain entirely different drugs manufactured and packaged to look like GLP-1 drugs. We are asking the FDA to lead efforts to safeguard our American supply chain and to work with other federal and state agencies to stop bad actors from producing counterfeit drugs.”\nHe said that the sky-high demand for GLP-1 drugs alongside high price tags and tight supplies is creating opportunities for bad actors to take advantage of consumers. Skrmetti said that there’s been an increase of the manufacturing and selling of counterfeit, untested products.\n“And counterfeit versions pose not only a risk to public health but also to our national security. There are reports that counterfeit GLP-1 drugs from India, Turkey, China, and other foreign sources have infiltrated the U.S. supply chain,” he said.\nCopyright 2025 WSMV. All rights reserved.",
