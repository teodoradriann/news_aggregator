    "title": "War Books: The Best Books We Read in 2023 - Modern War Institute",
    "text": "Editor’s note: Welcome to another installment of our weekly War Books series! The premise is simple and straightforward. We invite a participant to recommend five books and tell us what sets each one apart. War Books is a resource for MWI readers who want to learn more about important subjects related to modern war and are looking for books to add to their reading lists. This week we have a special year-end edition of War Books. We asked a number of people across the MWI network to share with readers the best books they read in 2023—nonfiction or fiction, quick reads or massive tomes, newly published or rediscovered classics. Here’s what they told us. John Amble [Defense Will Not Win the War](https://www.amazon.com/Defense-Will-Not-Win-War/dp/B001G50VX4), by W. F. Kernan Looking backward at history tends to smooth the jagged edges of uncertainty that characterize warfare. It’s easy to see the Allied war effort in Europe during World War II as a strategically wise march toward victory, and even that victory feels, if not inevitable, certainly more likely than it must have appeared to strategists charged with sequencing Allied campaigns to defeat Axis power. In 1942, when this book was written, opinion was divided on how best to pursue a military victory. It advocates for one such approach—eschewing the strategy of defense-first, liability-limiting warfare in favor of an offensive thrust directly at the heart of Europe. It’s value to readers today, though, is in challenging our biases and assumptions as we conceptualize the next big war—and how it will be won. [Conflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine](https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Evolution-Warfare-1945-Ukraine/dp/0063293137/), by David Petraeus and Andrew Roberts Studying a number of wide-ranging conflicts over an extended period of time to correctly identify both through lines that connect them and significant but often subtle departures from existing trends is challenging. Doing so in a narrative manner that presents a comprehensive, detailed, and nuanced picture of warfare’s evolution is even more so. This book fulfills this task better than almost any book that sets out to do so. Pieter Balcaen [The Utility of Force: The Art of War in the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/Utility-Force-Art-Modern-World/dp/0307278115), by General Rupert Smith This book contributes to an important discussion on how the military instrument can and should be introduced to achieve strategic aims (and the necessity of having clear strategic goals to start with). [SAS: Rogue Heroes](https://www.amazon.com/SAS-Authorized-Wartime-MacIntyre-2016-09-22/dp/B01N40F8RG/), by Ben Macintyre It is interesting to see the degree of innovation the SAS (Special Air Service) had during World War II, a good reflection when we see the degree of changes taking place in the current Ukrainian-Russian conflict. Kevin Benson [Confronting Saddam Hussein: George W. Bush and the Invasion of Iraq](https://www.amazon.com/Confronting-Saddam-Hussein-George-Invasion/dp/0197610773/), by Melvyn P. Leffler [Leap of Faith: Hubris, Negligence, and America’s Greatest Foreign Policy Tragedy](https://www.amazon.com/Leap-Faith-Negligence-Americas-Greatest/dp/1541768361/), by Michael J. Mazarr Mazarr Max Brooks [Japan at War: An Oral History](https://www.amazon.com/Japan-at-War-Oral-History/dp/1565840399/), by Haruko Taya Cook and Theodore F. Cook Like Studs Terkel’s The Good War, but focused on Japan, this is a vast, insightful, humanizing look into an enemy we tried so hard to dehumanize in World War II. In light of current competition with China, it’s more important than ever to study cultures that are so fundamentally different from our (still) largely Eurocentric way of thinking. Elizabeth Buchanan [Cobalt Red: How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives](https://www.amazon.com/Cobalt-Red-Blood-Congo-Powers/dp/1250284309/), by Siddharth Kara Energy transitions have not occurred neatly—many sources of renewable and low-emission energy have quite messy origin tales. Take for example, cobalt, largely found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It’s worth knowing more about just one of the supply chains in our “new era” of energy. [Conflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine](https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Evolution-Warfare-1945-Ukraine/dp/0063293137/), by David Petraeus and Andrew Roberts Our obsession with mapping wars and seeking elements of change or continuity rages on. This book expands our quest with assessments of the ongoing war in Ukraine and leaves me questioning if humans ever really learn from the past war—can we truly evolve in warfare? [On Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Wars-Michael-Mann/dp/0300266812/), by Michael Mann I think we need to hear a lot more from sociologists and anthropologists in matters of conflict and war. Mann delves into the role of individuals in opting to declare war or negotiate for peace. [Red Arctic: Russian Arctic Strategy under Putin](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Arctic-Russian-Strategy-Under/dp/0815738889/), by Elizabeth Buchanan Red Arctic charts Arctic strategy under Putin—how it is formulated, what drives it, and where it’s going. It’s a great book, although I may be biased. Help me feed my kids. Mark Cancian [Fighting Power: German and U.S. Army Performance, 1939–1945](https://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Power-Performance-1939-1945-Contributions/dp/0313091579/), by Martin Van Creveld I had occasion to reread this book this year, and it is still a superb analysis of the effect of personnel systems on military capability, a subject that gets much less attention than equipment or tactics. Kerry Chávez [War on the Ballot: How the Election Cycle Shapes Presidential Decision-Making in War](https://www.amazon.com/War-Ballot-Election-Presidential-Decision-Making/dp/0231209649), by Andrew Payne This book is a tremendous contribution to literatures on the domestic politics of war and civil-military relations. Positioned at the confluence of domestic and international politics, both require complex and clever analyses. Payne’s book is innovative, important, and researched at an impressive scale. Not only is it compelling, but it’s artfully written and a lovely read. David Clouse [Defeat Into Victory: Battling Japan in Burma and India, 1942–1945](https://www.amazon.com/Defeat-Into-Victory-Battling-1942-1945/dp/0815410220/), by Field Marshal Viscount Slim [Science, Strategy and War: The Strategic Theory of John Boyd](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Strategy-War-Strategic-History/dp/0415459524/), by Frans P.B. Osinga Nicholas Dockery [Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology](https://www.amazon.com/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002/), by Chris Miller Miller explores the influential impact of Moore’s Law, which projected the doubling of transistors on a chip every two years and has been a driving force in the rapid advancement of technology, exemplified by the growth from four transistors on a chip to 11.8 billion today. The book delves into the geopolitical and economic significance of semiconductor chips, detailing their role in global power structures and the race for technological supremacy, particularly highlighting the strategic importance of the semiconductor industry in global politics and economics. The narrative spans historical figures and pivotal moments in semiconductor development, including the Cold War’s tech race, Europe’s lag in transistor technology, and the rise of Asian semiconductor powerhouses, while also critiquing the industry’s masculine culture and providing insights into the global implications of chip manufacturing and distribution. [2034: A Novel of the Next World War](https://www.amazon.com/2034-Novel-Next-World-War/dp/1984881272/), by Elliot Ackerman and James Stavridis Ackerman and Stavridis delve into a futuristic conflict where technology and military strategy collide. The novel’s story, drawing a parallel with the historical hoax of “The Turk” chess machine, reflects on the dangers of overreliance on technology in warfare. Central characters navigate a tense geopolitical landscape involving the United States, China, Russia, Iran, and India, revealing a world where strident nationalism contrasts with global interconnectedness. The novel underscores the pivotal role of human decision-making in warfare, even as it is increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence and cyber capabilities, leading to a conclusion that the key to overcoming technological dominance might lie in eschewing technology altogether. Zachary Griffiths [Men at Arms](https://www.amazon.com/Men-at-Arms-Evelyn-Waugh/dp/0316926280), by Evelyn Waugh I’d like to recommend Evelyn Waugh’s Men at Arms (and the broader Sword of Honor trilogy). I turn to these books most years. As I wrote in a [review](https://warontherocks.com/2023/11/waugh-we-fight/) around Veterans Day this year, “Waugh helps me make sense of my military service.” Thom Hawkins [The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin and Reward](https://www.amazon.com/Misbehavior-Markets-Fractal-Financial-Turbulence/dp/0465043577/), by Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard L. Hudson While on its face this is a book about the volatility of financial markets, the ideas apply more broadly to complex systems, including situational awareness and prediction in the tactical environment. Frank Hoffman [Command: The Politics of Military Operations from Korea to Ukraine](https://www.amazon.com/Command-Politics-Military-Operations-Ukraine/dp/0197694578/), by Lawrence Freedman [Planning for Protraction: A Historically Informed Approach to Great-Power War and Sino-US Competition](https://www.amazon.com/Planning-Protraction-Adelphi-Iskander-Rehman/dp/1032734779/), by Iskander Rehman [The Arms of the Future: Technology and Close Combat in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.amazon.com/Arms-Future-Technology-Twenty-First-Perspectives/dp/1350352950/), by Jack Watling Laura Keenan [Brave Men](https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Men-Ernie-Pyle/dp/0803287682), by Ernie Pyle This is a valuable firsthand account of World War II that captures the essence of the human experience during wartime. Pyle brings to life the stories of ordinary soldiers, depicting their struggles, camaraderie, and resilience amid the chaos of war. It is a reminder of how universal the emotions of soldiers fighting are, no matter what conflict or time period. Steve Leonard [Fighting in the Dark: Naval Combat at Night, 1904–1944](https://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Dark-Naval-Combat-1904-1944/dp/1682477800/), edited by Vincent P. O’Hara and Trent Hone This is a fantastic collection of historical essays that trace the evolution of the naval technological and procedural innovations that fostered the ability to fight at night, something that was rare and deliberately avoided before the twentieth century. [Military Culture Shift: The Impact of War, Money, and Generational Perspective on Morale, Retention, and Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/Military-Culture-Shift-Generational-Perspective/dp/1934617784/), by Corie Weathers For everyone who complains about the “woke” military this book should be required reading. Generational cultural shifts are nothing new, nor is how older generations react to them. Theo Lipsky [People in Glass Houses](https://www.amazon.com/People-Glass-Houses-Shirley-Hazzard/dp/0312424221/), by Shirley Hazzard This book, the funniest I read this year, satirizes the bureaucracy of the 1960s United Nations. Yet those serving in the military today will recognize the world Hazzard sketches as theirs, and so get much from it—perhaps above all, catharsis. Paul Lushenko [Should We Ban Killer Robots?](https://www.amazon.com/Should-Killer-Robots-Political-Theory/dp/1509548513/) by Deane Baker I found this book useful to understand how we think about the moral and ethical implications of lethal autonomous weapons systems, and what can shape soldiers’ trust in partnering with them during future wars. [Radical War: Data, Attention, and Control in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-War-Attention-Control-Twenty-First/dp/0197656544/), by Matthew Ford and Andrew Hoskins I found this book useful to understand how emerging technologies have not only respatialized war but potentially instituted a new trinity of interdependent mechanisms that shape modern warfare and its outcomes, thus replacing the fabled Clausewitzian model of chance, passion, and politics. Collin Meisel [Diary of a Madman, and Other Stories](https://www.amazon.com/Diary-Madman-other-stories-Xun/dp/0824813170/), by Lu Xun (translated by Willam A. Lyell) Written during China’s Republican Era following the fall of the Qing dynasty, Lu Xun’s stories offer a unique and intimate view into the chaos and tragedy that defined much of that period. The book helped me better understand why so many Chinese were drawn to the Chinese Communist Party in the Republican Era and the years that followed, as the promise of order—virtually any order, so long as it did not involve domination by foreign powers—must have been extraordinarily appealing. And it has helped me empathize with—while continuing to strongly disagree with—adherents to other at-times fanatical movements in today’s modern wars. Walker Mills [White Sun War: The Campaign for Taiwan](https://www.amazon.com/White-Sun-War-Campaign-Casemate/dp/1636242502/), by Mick Ryan Ryan’s book is a thrilling, fictional take on what an invasion of Taiwan and resulting war might look like in the next decade or so. This book will keep you reading all through the night. [Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland](https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Men-Reserve-Battalion-Solution/dp/0062303023/), by Christopher Browning Browning’s study of a single unit’s role in the Holocaust is a powerful and chilling portrait of how evil can be done by the eponymous “ordinary men” who made up the battalion, and the effect that it had on them. Rick Montcalm [Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153/), by Susan Cain As an introvert, I appreciate the candid assessment of the dangers of relying on extroverts as leaders. This book provides a more comprehensive differentiation between introverts and extroverts based on energy management versus simply saying an extrovert is a people person and an introvert is not. [Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don’t Know](https://www.amazon.com/Talking-Strangers-Should-about-People/dp/0316299227/), by Malcolm Gladwell I appreciate this book’s case study approach to showing the dangers of inherent bias and preconceived notions. As a member of a security force assistance brigade, this hits home considering how often we find ourselves in some form of negotiations with foreign partners, each of whom operates within a context distinct from ours and other partners with whom we may interact. Randy Noorman [We Few](https://www.amazon.com/We-Few-Special-Forces-Vietnam/dp/1636240534/) and [Whispers in the Tall Grass](https://www.amazon.com/Whispers-Tall-Grass-Nick-Brokhausen/dp/1612007759/), by Nick Brokhausen These were written by a former member of MACV-SOG (Military Assistance Command, Vietnam–Studies and Observations Group) in the Vietnam War. The reason I liked them both so much was first the immense bravery of these guys fighting at such close distances and second the author’s ability to describe the tactical situations he was in so that at least people with military experience can imagine it the way it actually was. Elena Pokalova [The Weaponisation of Everything: A Field Guide to the New Way of War](https://www.amazon.com/Weaponisation-Everything-Field-Guide-New/dp/0300270410/), by Mark Galeotti [Hybrid Warriors: Proxies, Freelancers and Moscow’s Struggle for Ukraine](https://www.amazon.com/Hybrid-Warriors-Proxies-Freelancers-Struggle/dp/178738795X/), by Anna Arutunyan [Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism](https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Democracy-Seductive-Lure-Authoritarianism/dp/1984899503/), by Anne Applebaum [Daring to Struggle: China’s Global Ambitions Under Xi Jinping](https://www.amazon.com/Daring-Struggle-Chinas-Ambitions-Jinping/dp/0197545645/), by Bates Gill Alec Rice [Let the Sea Make a Noise . . . A History of the North Pacific from Magellan to MacArthur](https://www.amazon.com/Let-Sea-Make-Noise-Macarthur/dp/0465051529/), by Walter A. McDougall What is old is new again: a keen reminder of the principle that geopolitics trumps ideology. This book is composed in a bit of a strange style (interludes are scattered throughout consisting of fictional banter between numerous historical figures). Setting that quirk aside the book is extremely readable and full of information. It clearly traces the connections between the activities and motivations of multiple nations regarding the Pacific over the past few hundred years as Russia ventured east into Siberia and North America, the United States forged west across the North American continent, and Japan modernized in response to encroaching European powers in Asia. I believe every US military leader should be required to read this book. Now. Mick Ryan [Military Agility: Ensuring Rapid and Effective Transition from Peace to War](https://www.amazon.com/Military-Agility-Ensuring-Effective-Transition/dp/0813178843/), by Meir Finkel [The Russo-Ukrainian War: The Return of History](https://www.amazon.com/Russo-Ukrainian-War-Return-History/dp/1324051191/), by Serhii Plokhy Rebecca Segal [A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental Illness](https://www.amazon.com/First-Rate-Madness-Uncovering-Between-Leadership/dp/0143121332/), by Nassir Ghaemi This is about why successful crisis and wartime leaders would often be described as mentally less healthy than successful peacetime and garrison leaders, who are typically very mentally healthy. [Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World](https://www.amazon.com/Originals-How-Non-Conformists-Move-World/dp/014312885X/), by Adam Grant This one is about making change. It’s less directly war related and more focused on organizational leadership. [White Sun War: The Campaign for Taiwan](https://www.amazon.com/White-Sun-War-Campaign-Casemate/dp/1636242502/), by Mick Ryan This novel paints a great picture of a future fight. Peter Schrijver [The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine](https://www.amazon.com/Gates-Europe-History-Ukraine/dp/1541675649/), by Serhii Plokhy This book on Ukrainian history from a Ukrainian perspective is essential reading for gaining a deeper understanding of Russia and Ukraine today. From a review of the book: “Plokhy combines scholarly authority with narrative flair.” Frank Sobchak [The Hardest Place: The American Military Adrift in Afghanistan’s Pech Valley](https://www.amazon.com/Hardest-Place-American-Military-Afghanistans/dp/0812985222/), by Wesley Morgan This should be on every military reading list. Frankly, it best explains the challenges of counterinsurgency in general and in Afghanistan specifically. [Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Kill-First-Targeted-Assassinations/dp/0812982118/), by Ronen Bergman This book seems especially relevant in light of the Israel-Hamas war and was quite revelatory. John Spencer [Elon Musk](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281/), by Walter Isaacson Among this book’s themes, one that stands out is the degree to which—and the manner in which—social media is influencing the information dimension of politics and war, which we’re seeing today in Israel and Ukraine. [World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War](https://www.amazon.com/World-War-Oral-History-Zombie/dp/0307346617/), by Max Brooks This is without a doubt the best audiobook ever created. The novel’s plot might be science fiction, but so much of it is actually very real. It is fundamentally about human reactions to catastrophes and a lot can be learned from it. Kevin Stringer [Small State Irregular Warfare in the Twenty-First Century: Strategic Utility of Security Sector Assistance](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Irregular-Warfare-Twenty-First-Century/dp/1977262139/), by Marius Kristiansen A highly recommended small book that stimulates integrated thinking on strategy, irregular warfare, and security sector assistance. [Germany 1923: Hyperinflation, Hitler’s Putsch, and Democracy in Crisis](https://www.amazon.com/Germany-1923-Hyperinflation-Hitlers-Democracy/dp/1324093463/), by Volker Ullrich An examination of Germany and the Weimar Republic one hundred years ago. It offers unique insights and understanding of the post-WWI victor’s peace and its results for Germany. Patrick Sullivan [The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz](https://www.amazon.com/Splendid-Vile-Churchill-Family-Defiance/dp/0385348738/), by Erik Larson This book chronicles Winston Churchill’s first year as prime minister, a period that saw the United Kingdom stand alone as the last line of opposition to Nazi Germany’s attempted conquest of Europe. Employing the “novelistic” approach to history that he popularized with Devil in the White City, In the Garden of Beasts, and Dead Wake, Larson deconstructs all the personalities and debates of the various orbits that informed Churchill’s strategic decision-making, from his war cabinet, to his political and military opponents in Nazi Germany, to his noncommittal American ally, and, most importantly, to his family and closest friends. This treatment provides essential insight into the nature and character of Churchill’s well-earned profile in courage, but without exclusive focus on him and removed from the hagiography of other recent popular works (especially in film and television). As such, The Splendid and the Vile is essential scholarship for any student of Churchill, World War II, or strategic leadership. Beyond this, Larson continues to churn out bestsellers for a reason—he’s a damn engrossing writer, and at the risk of sounding gauche, I would read anything by him sight unseen. Benjamin Van Horrick “ [How Is It Possible to Be Loved and Yet to Feel Deeply Lonely?](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faeon.co%2Fessays%2Fhow-is-it-possible-to-be-loved-and-yet-to-feel-deeply-lonely&data=05%7C02%7Cjohn.amble%40westpoint.edu%7C4bd98a9306d345ec314d08dc076016a1%7C99ff8811351740a9bf1045ea0a321f0b%7C0%7C0%7C638393356504353319%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=R%2FtxNQDEB18oO8QTRW0ghWfVAV3Av9veZ5ElOlRFKMw%3D&reserved=0)” by Kaitlyn Creasy Dr. Creasy’s essay treats return and the loneliness that often follows with rare depth, nuance, and warmth. The essay articulates many emotions servicemembers and veterans feel upon reentry. A thankful nation and relieved families welcome home veterans, but for servicemembers, nagging loneliness often persists following their transformative, both negatively and positively, deployment. Reading this generative essay can stoke a meaningful discussion for those returning and those eager to embrace. “ [How to Beat Roulette: One Gambler Figured It Out and Won Big](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Ffeatures%2F2023-how-to-beat-roulette-gambler-figures-it-out%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cjohn.amble%40westpoint.edu%7C4bd98a9306d345ec314d08dc076016a1%7C99ff8811351740a9bf1045ea0a321f0b%7C0%7C0%7C638393356504353319%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=VYZHrTSbwbwqzTx9duskLJFgjry1lNsmHKDGst4SuwE%3D&reserved=0),” by Kit Chellel Risk, luck, and persistence punctuate Kit Chellel’s Bloomberg long-form piece on how one gambler learned how to beat to roulette. Chellel’s detailed reporting and breakneck prose are not just a mediation on beating the odds but how obsession and practice overcame a once insurmountable obstacle.

One hopes that his analysis will renew the determination of US and Chinese policymakers to ensure that competition does not culminate in catastrophe.

    "text": "Assam gets lion’s share as Centre clears Rs 458 Cr aid for flood-hit Northeast\nMeghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram together receive over Rs 80 crore to tackle monsoon-triggered floods & landslides\nGuwahati, July 10: In a major relief for flood and landslide-affected northeastern states, the Centre has approved a financial package of Rs 458 crore for Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, and Mizoram under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).\nThe funds form part of a larger Rs 1,066.80 crore allocation for six states — including Kerala and Uttarakhand — reeling under the impact of this year’s intense southwest monsoon.\nAssam, among the worst-hit states in the Northeast, has been sanctioned Rs 375.60 crore, followed by Rs 30.40 crore for Meghalaya, Rs 29.20 crore for Manipur, and Rs 22.80 crore for Mizoram.\n“Today the central government has approved ₹1066.80 crore for flood- and landslide-affected states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Kerala, and Uttarakhand as part of the Central share under SDRF. More than Rs 8000 crore from SDRF/NDRF funds has been provided to 19 states this year,” wrote Union Home Minister Amit Shah in social media.\nAccording to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Centre’s priority has not only been financial assistance but also comprehensive logistical support.\nThis includes the deployment of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Indian Army, and Air Force for rescue and relief missions.\nThese allocations come at a time when large swathes of the region remain submerged or cut off due to landslides and road washouts.\nNortheast states have witnessed severe monsoon-triggered calamities this year, with overflowing rivers, breached embankments, and deadly landslides impacting thousands.\nIn Assam, five districts remain severely affected by floods, with over 29,000 people impacted across 170 villages. As of Wednesday, two people have lost their lives in Golaghat district, one of the worst-hit among the five.\nNationwide, the Centre has disbursed over Rs 8,000 crore this year through the SDRF and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).\nOf this, Rs 6,166 crore was allocated to 14 states under SDRF and Rs 1,988.91 crore to 12 states via NDRF.\nAn additional Rs 726.20 crore was released from the State Disaster Mitigation Fund, while Rs 17.55 crore came from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund.\nDuring the current monsoon, over 100 NDRF teams have been deployed across 21 states and Union Territories — a large number stationed in the Northeast — underscoring the gravity of the situation in the region.\nPTI",

    "text": "Stop alla vendita di ostriche francesi Arcachon per intossicazioni dovute al norovirus, quali sono i sintomi Vietata la vendita delle ostriche del Bacino d'Arcachon, in Francia, a causa di un'epidemia di norovirus Pubblicato il: Ostriche francesi infette. Le autorità hanno sospeso la vendita dei molluschi allevati nel Bacino di Arcachon, a sud di Bordeaux, per un’infezione da norovirus. Protestano gli allevatori, che danno la colpa ai sistemi di depurazione delle acque. [Bloccata la vendita delle ostriche di Arcachon](#iol-toc-7c3e323ab49f3a637febb9dd3d67c3f6) [I sintomi del norovirus](#iol-toc-534983d07c9a6184b43408b4a7d0c7d9) [Duramente colpiti gli allevatori francesi](#iol-toc-1167bb6d314df3ce8296f082ab92342d) Bloccata la vendita delle ostriche di Arcachon La prefettura regionale di Bordeaux ha sospeso le vendite delle ostriche e di tutti i molluschi allevati nell’area del bacino di Arcachon, nella Francia sud occidentale, sull’oceano Atlantico. La decisione è stata presa dopo diverse segnalazioni di intossicazioni alimentari avvenute dopo che i pazienti avevano mangiato alcuni dei prodotti provenienti dalla zona, tra le più attive in Francia nell’allevamento dei molluschi. La zona del Bacino di Arcachon Oltre al Bacino di Arcachon, che sarebbe l’area più colpita, la prefettura ha sospeso le vendite anche dei prodotti provenienti da altre due zone: il mare attorno all’isola della Banc d’Arguin e della vicina Duna del Pilat, pochi chilometri a sud di Arcachon. I sintomi del norovirus Secondo le autorità, i sintomi presentati da molte persone che hanno ingerito i molluschi coltivati nel sud ovest della Francia sarebbero dovuti a un’infezione da norovirus. Si tratta del patogeno che rappresenta la causa più comune della gastroenterite. I sintomi presentati sono infatti quelli dei virus che colpiscono stomaco e intestino. Nessuno dei casi analizzati sembra essere grave. Solitamente, la ripresa dei pazienti affetti da norovirus avviene in pochi giorni. Duramente colpiti gli allevatori francesi Il divieto di vendita, esteso poi anche alle attività di allevamento e alla pesca, arriva in un pessimo momento per i commercianti di molluschi francesi. Circa un terzo della produzione annuale infatti viene consumata a Capodanno. Si tratta, secondo le associazioni che rappresentano la categoria, di un danno economico senza precedenti. Fortunatamente per gli allevatori questo divieto è arrivato dopo Natale, festività durante la quale vengono venduti la maggior parte dei molluschi allevati. La causa dell’infezione da norovirus nei molluschi francesi sarebbero le forti piogge che hanno colpito la zona di Bordeaux negli ultimi mesi. I sistemi di depurazione delle acque reflue, obsoleti secondo gli allevatori, non avrebbero funzionato adeguatamente. Questo avrebbe comportato l’inquinamento del mare del Bacino di Arcachon e di conseguenza dei molluschi allevati nella zona.",

    "text": "Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of New York on Thursday, staging a mock funeral in a demonstration against Israel's continued heavy bombardement of the besieged Gaza strip.Holding banners demanding an immediate ceasefire, the activists gathered in Manhattan's Bryant Park while some briefly stood in the middle of the busy Sixth Avenue in the heart of New York's Midtown district.Several women shrouded in black held baby dolls swaddled in white cloths to represent the toll the fighting has taken on children in the coastal territory.The mock funeral procession headed to New York's iconic Times Square where the protest continued with giant electronic advertisements as a backdrop.\"Today's action is to draw attention to the fact that, as of now, almost 10,000 children, just children alone, not counting everybody, not counting all Palestinians, have been killed... in Gaza,\" said archivist Grace Lile, 64.The war, which started with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, has devastated much of northern Gaza, and the bombardment and fighting has intensified especially in the southern city of Khan Yunis.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack, which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 21,320 people, mostly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry.New York City has seen dozens of protests since the October 7 attack and Israel's military response, with both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel demonstrators taking to the streets.© ",

    "title": "Bitcoin has surged 67% in value since September—here's why",
    "text": "Bitcoin has surged 67% in value since September—here’s why\nEven with a regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past year, the price of bitcoin rose steadily through most of 2023, and now sits at around $43,610 — a nearly $18,000 increase in value since September.\nBitcoin hit a peak value of around $68,000 in November 2021. But by November 2022, it had lost more than 75% of that value following the collapse of FTX, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time. And now, it’s bounced back up again.\nOther popular cryptocurrencies have followed a similar trajectory in what has been a remarkable turnaround for an industry battered by scandal. But why now?\nA pending decision on cryptocurrency ETFs seems to be driving demand Investors have been buying cryptocurrencies ahead of the much-anticipated approval of the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which is expected later in January.\nPending approval, a slew of investment firms are expected to offer ETFs, most notably Blackrock, the largest asset management firm in the world.\nAn ETF is an investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset or index — in this case, bitcoin.\nThe advantage of a bitcoin or crypto ETF is that it would offer a way for investors to benefit from the price movements of bitcoin without owning the cryptocurrency directly.\nIf approved, cryptocurrency ETFs are expected to be traded on traditional SEC-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, according to CoinDesk.\nThat would open up the cryptocurrency market to a wider array of buyers who don’t use cryptocurrency exchanges already. In anticipation of ETF approval, investors have been piling back into the market, which has driven up the price of bitcoin.\n“It really opens the door for all kinds of demands. And if demand goes up, price goes up,” says Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of CNBC’s Financial Advisor Council. Boneparth holds investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThere are other factors at play, too. The Federal Reserve has signaled that its interest rate hike cycle is over, an encouraging sign for the economy as inflation continues to fall. This has made riskier assets like crypto more attractive to investors.\nAnother factor is bitcoin’s “halving,” which is expected in April. Halving is a built-in mechanism related to bitcoin mining that periodically reduces token supply. Decreasing the supply of bitcoin is expected to further stoke demand.\nTo break it down, the factors behind the recent surge in bitcoin prices are “60% bitcoin ETF, 20% halving and 20% economic conditions,” says Boneparth.\nHowever, “be mindful about the relentless upward [price] movement over the past few months,” says Owen Lau, executive director at financial services company Oppenheimer & Co. “A lot of the good news appears to have been priced in.”\nBitcoin remains a risky investment Cryptocurrency is widely seen as a speculative asset that doesn’t derive its value from an underlying entity. It’s also extremely volatile, sometimes with price fluctuations of 5% to 10% in a single day. There are no guarantees that it will retain any of its current value, either.\nAs such, financial planners typically advise against investing more than you’re willing to lose.\n“Bitcoin is the best performing asset class in the last 10 years,” says Boneparth. “But owning that performance comes with a large amount of risk.”\nDON’T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?
