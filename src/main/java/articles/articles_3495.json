    "text": "Pope meets with U.S. Cardinal Burke December 29, 2023By Cindy Wooden Catholic News Service Filed Under: Feature, News, Vatican, World News VATICAN CITY (CNS) — U.S. Cardinal Raymond L. Burke, a former top Vatican official, met privately with Pope Francis Dec. 29, about a month after reports that Pope Francis wanted to stop giving him a monthly salary and would ask him to pay the market rate for his Vatican apartment. Pope Francis and U.S. Cardinal Raymond L. Burke meet in the library of the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican Dec. 29, 2023. (CNS photo/Vatican Media) The Vatican press office provided no information on the meeting other than to announce it had taken place. Reached at the cardinal’s apartment, his secretary told Catholic News Service, “His Eminence wishes to give no comment at this time.” During a meeting Nov. 20 with the heads of the offices of the Roman Curia, Pope Francis reportedly informed the Curia leaders of his plan. Various reports say Cardinal Burke is expected to find his own apartment in Rome and move out of the Vatican accommodations by the end of February. Pope Francis “didn’t see why he should continue to subsidize Burke attacking him and the church,” and the pope thought “he seemed to have plenty of money from America,” a person who spoke to Pope Francis told Catholic News Service. Cardinal Burke, 75, is the former head of head the Apostolic Signatura, the church’s highest court. Before Pope Benedict XVI appointed him to that role, he had served as archbishop of St. Louis. In 2016, Cardinal Burke and three other cardinals publicly released a critical set of questions, known as “dubia,” that they had sent to Pope Francis about his teaching on the family. They published the questions after waiting in vain for two months for a response from the pope. A few days before the Synod of Bishops on synodality opened in October, Cardinal Burke and four other cardinals released another set of “dubia” that they had sent the pope seeking clarification on doctrinal and pastoral questions expected to be raised at the synod. They did not release the pope’s responses to them, but the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith did later.

The drones were launched from the territory of the Kursk, Oryol and Rostov regions of the Russian Federation, including from Millerovo, as well as from Primorsko-Akhtarsk and from the temporarily occupied Crimea from the area of Cape Chauda.\nThe main blow fell on the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Odessa regions.\nAt the same time, enemy drones were hit in seven locations, and debris fell in four. Despite the scale of the strike, Ukrainian air defense once again demonstrated high efficiency.\nLet us recall that on the night of Thursday, June 12, Russian occupation forces attacked Kharkov with kamikaze drones, 11 hits were recorded.\nAlso follow “Pryamy” on Facebook , Twitter , Telegram and Instagram.",

    "text": "Boeing sufre su primera huelga en 16 años. Los trabajadores comienzan este viernes los paros tras rechazar el acuerdo al que habían llegado los sindicatos con el fabricante de aviones.\nAlrededor del 95% de los miembros del sindicato International Association of Machinist (IAM) ha votado en contra, al considerarlo insuficiente, del pacto que contemplaba un incremento general de los salarios del 25% en cuatros años.\nAseguran que los trabajadores llevan sufriendo una década de estancamiento salarial. La petición del sindicato incluía aumentos de alrededor del 40%.\n\"Se trata de luchar por nuestro futuro. Volveremos a la mesa siempre que podamos para impulsar las cuestiones que nuestros miembros dicen que son importantes\", ha señalado el presidente del sindicato IAM, Jon Holden.\nHa defendido que la huelga está justificada \"por prácticas laborales injustas\", puesto que asegura que los empleados han sufrido una \"conducta discriminatoria, interrogatorios coercitivos, vigilancia ilegal y promesas ilegales de beneficios\".\nPor su parte, el nuevo consejero delegado de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, había pedido que evitaran la huelga: Pido que no sacrifiquen la oportunidad de asegurar juntos nuestro futuro, por las frustraciones del pasado\". Mientras, el CEO de la unidad de aviones comerciales, Stephanie Pope, ha defendido que el acuerdo era el \"mejor que hemos presentado jamás\".\nTras el rechazo, más de 30.000 trabajadores están llamados a hacer huelga desde este viernes, deteniendo la producción de la mayoría de los aviones de la compañía.\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nSeptember 13, 2024 03:29 ET (07:29 GMT)\nComparte © Dow Jones - 2024",

    "title": "La ONU alerta de aumento de un 8% de la violencia en Haití en el último trimestre de 2023",
    "text": "Puerto Príncipe.- La\nviolencia experimentó un aumento del 8% en Haití entre octubre y diciembre de 2023 respecto al trimestre anterior, para alcanzar un total de más de 8,400 víctimas desde enero de ese año, informó este jueves el Departamento de Derechos Humanos de la Oficina Integrada de Naciones Unidas en Haití (Binuh).\nLa expansión de la violencia por parte de grupos criminales se produjo particularmente en el departamento de Artibonite y en la periferia sur de la capital, con un aumento de la violencia sexual en varios municipios, según el último informe trimestral de la organización.\nLa representante especial del secretario general de la ONU y jefa de la Binuh, María Isabel Salvador, enfatizó que esta violencia conduce a una inseguridad crónica, amenazando la estabilidad y el bienestar de los ciudadanos.\nTambién te puede interesar:\nMiles de desplazados en zona de Puerto Príncipe a causa de la violencia de las bandas\nEl documento también revela el impacto en los niños, con al menos 53 menores víctimas de violencia o involucrados en actividades criminales, y destaca los obstáculos existentes para entregar ayuda humanitaria o para desplazarse en vehículos debido al control de las carreteras por parte de las pandillas armadas.\nPor otra parte, el texto señala que el sistema judicial, afectado por la violencia y problemas estructurales, muestra algunos signos de mejora con medidas para reducir la prisión preventiva durante este período, en el que se procesaron 400 casos que resultaron en la liberación de al menos 258 personas.\nSin embargo, las operaciones policiales han visto un aumento de víctimas, lo que pone de relieve la persistente inseguridad, de acuerdo con un comunicado de la ONU.\nAnte esta situación, el informe llama a la comunidad internacional a mantener a Haití en la agenda y respalda la importancia de desplegar una misión multinacional de apoyo a la seguridad, que estaría liderada por Kenia y en la que participarían fuerzas de Bahamas, Antigua, Barbuda y Jamaica, aunque su entrada en acción se mantiene en suspenso.\nLa nota resalta el compromiso y la determinación de los Estados miembros de Naciones Unidas para enviar una fuerza internacional a Haití, tal y como solicitara el primer ministro haitiano, Ariel Henry, en octubre de 2022, sin que se haya establecido una fecha y un plan concreto de actuación para pacificar el país caribeño.",
