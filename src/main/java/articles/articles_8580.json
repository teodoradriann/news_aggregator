    "title": "Israel diz estar a concluir operação em Khan Yunis e anuncia envio de tropas para Rafah",
    "text": "Israel diz estar a concluir operação em Khan Yunis e anuncia envio de tropas para Rafah\nO ministro da Defesa israelita, Yoav Gallant, afirmou hoje que o Exército desmantelou o comando do movimento islamita palestiniano Hamas em Khan Yunis e vai deslocar-se para Rafah, no sul da Faixa de Gaza, para aí fazer o mesmo.\n\"A brigada do Hamas em Khan Yunis, que se vangloriou de estar a repelir as Forças de Defesa de Israel (FDI), está a ser desmantelada, e digo-vos que estamos a concluir a missão em Khan Yunis e que também chegaremos a Rafah e eliminaremos todos os terroristas que estão a tentar fazer-nos mal\", declarou Gallant durante uma visita à cidade.\nNum encontro com militares da 98.ª Divisão do Exército israelita, o ministro congratulou-se com o facto de as operações em Khan Yunis \"estarem a avançar com resultados incríveis\", o que torna a situação cada vez \"mais complicada\" para os combatentes palestinianos, noticiou o diário The Times of Israel.\n\"Não têm armas, não têm munições, não tem capacidade para tratar os feridos. Têm 10.000 terroristas mortos e outros 10.000 feridos que não estão operacionais\", asseverou o ministro da Defesa israelita, sublinhando que Israel desferiu um golpe que \"corroeu\" o poder do Hamas.\nAssim, o governante indicou que estas operações israelitas tanto à superfície como no subsolo da Faixa de Gaza, e concretamente em Khan Yunis, \"aproximam o regresso dos reféns\" mantidos em cativeiro pelo Hamas, que acusou de só entender a linguagem da força.\nA 07 de outubro, combatentes do Movimento de Resistência Islâmica (Hamas) -- desde 2007 no poder na Faixa de Gaza e classificado como organização terrorista pelos Estados Unidos, a União Europeia e Israel -- realizaram em território israelita um ataque de proporções sem precedentes desde a criação do Estado de Israel, em 1948, fazendo 1.163 mortos, na maioria civis, e cerca de 250 reféns, 132 dos quais permanecem em cativeiro, segundo o mais recente balanço das autoridades israelitas.\nEm retaliação, Israel declarou uma guerra para \"erradicar\" o Hamas, que começou por cortes ao abastecimento de comida, água, eletricidade e combustível na Faixa de Gaza e bombardeamentos diários, seguidos de uma ofensiva terrestre ao norte do território, que depois se estendeu ao sul.\nA guerra entre Israel e o Hamas, que hoje entrou no 118.º dia e continua a ameaçar alastrar a toda a região do Médio Oriente, fez até agora na Faixa de Gaza mais de 27.000 mortos, 67.000 feridos e 8.000 desaparecidos, na maioria civis, de acordo com o último balanço das autoridades locais, e quase dois milhões de deslocados (mais de 85% dos habitantes), mergulhando o enclave palestiniano sobrepovoado e pobre numa grave crise humanitária, com toda a população afetada por níveis graves de fome que já começou a fazer vítimas, segundo a ONU.",

    "text": "This year, the non-stop Israeli bombardment and thousands of lives lost means that Valentine’s day will be a difficult day in Gaza. Bombings have destroyed most properties in Gaza and thousands face imminent famine. People will not be celebrating in ways Gazans have in past years: sharing sweets, Gaza-grown flowers, balloons, and red teddy bears.\nWe join many throughout the world demanding a cease-fire and continuing our advocacy for an end to Israeli military occupation, apartheid, genocide, and blockade.\nNow more than ever we wish to reach Palestinians in Gaza with a message of love, as we work for a day when flowers once again can bloom in Gaza.\nHow to share your Valentine to Gaza\n- Print this graphic, take a photo holding it and share on your social media. Tag @ afsc_org on\nTikTok, and use #LoveToGaza.\n- Download\nthis graphicand change your social media profile picture for the month of February and reshare our posts on social media.\nIdeas for where to take your photo:\n- With your legislator\n- At a city landmark or iconic location\n- With your congregation/club/class\n- At a rally or event\nWhat to do after you send a Valentine\nCall on Congress to support an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Ask your followers to call and write everyday.\n- Share about the immediate need for humanitarian aid. Ask your followers to donate to\nwww.afsc.org/give2gaza.\n“If you grew up in [Gaza] Palestine like I did, you knew it was Valentine’s Day season when the best pop songs are released, when everyone on the streets was wearing red, and when all the locally grown roses were nearly sold out. As a little boy, I wasn’t concerned with buying romantic gifts, but I did enjoy the atmosphere and the energy on the streets of Gaza as people took the time to step away from the harsh reality of our surroundings to focus on romance, beauty, and gratitude.” Hani Almadhoun, UNRWA-USA, 2020",

    "text": "JACKSON COUNTY, Ore. -- \"We work on ecological restoration projects for the benefit of wildlife habitat on the one hand, but tremendous community benefits as well,\" Rogue River Watershed Council Executive Director Brian Barr tells NewsWatch 12. “All of our projects have a positive impact on the water quality in streams like Bear Creek, Elk Creek, Little Butte Creek, and those benefits to water quality run to everyone that uses the river.”\nIn 2024, RRWC worked on a habitat restoration project along the Bear Creek greenway in Talent, Ore., an area that was devastated by the Almeda Fire in 2020.\n“The total cost of that project was just short of $1 million,” Barr says. “It took about four years to develop and a summer to implement. A fairly sizable chunk of that funding came from the United States Forest Service, federal funds that helped us get this work on the ground. This summer we were slated to do seven projects throughout Jackson County. The total price tag of all that work is around $4 million and $2.5 million was tabbed as federal funding and we’re not entirely certain that money is going to be available when we go to do the restoration work.”\nThese projects aim to restore habitats by improving water quality, soaking flood plains with water to help creeks and rivers flow in dryer months and creating natural environments that are welcoming for wildlife like salmon, steelhead and more. However, wildlife aren’t the only living beings that benefit from RRWC’s work.\n“This water [in Bear Creek] will flow into the Rogue River and down to the cities of Gold Hill, Rogue River and Grants Pass,” Barr says. “Some portion of this water will get pulled up into the drinking water intakes in those cities and get sent out to folks that rely on drinking water in those towns. Cleaner water impacts you when you turn your faucet on and I really think that’s one of the things we take for granted when we turn our faucet on.”\nWith the funding uncertainty, RRWC is holding off on contracting work for five of the seven projects along the Upper Rogue River this year.\n\"We have saddled up to our computers and we are writing a lot of proposals right now to foundations and other sources of funding that we haven't really tapped into in the past,” Barr explains. “We'll see how our story plays with them.\"",

    "text": "В Беларуси запретили продавать популярные леденцы от российского изготовителя.\nЛеденцовую карамель «Монпансье», производимую компанией «Изобилие профит» из РФ, признали опасной, – сообщает корреспондент сетевого издания «Белновости».\nТеперь эта сладость фигурирует в «черном списке» опасной продукции Госстандарта.\nОб этом пресс-служба ведомства сообщает в своем телеграм-канале «Безопасность и качество».\nПричиной запрета называется несоответствие требованиям следующих технических регламентов Таможенного союза:\n– «О безопасности пищевой продукции»;\n– «Пищевая продукция в части ее маркировки»;\n– «Требования безопасности пищевых добавок, ароматизаторов и технологических вспомогательных средств».\nОбращается внимание: во время проведенных испытаний специалисты обнаружили превышение в карамели заявленного в маркировке красителя.\nРечь идет о веществе, именуемым как желтый солнечный закат (Е110).\nЕго количество составило 59,5 мг/кг при максимально допустимом уровне 50 мг/кг (превышено в 1,19 раза).\nТакже в ходе испытаний был выявлен и незаявленный в маркировке синтетический краситель понсо 4R (Е124) в количестве 33,6 мг/кг.",
