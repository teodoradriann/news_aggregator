    "text": "Why Africa should invest in modern weather forecasting technology What you need to know: - Early warning systems are an essential tool for risk management and disaster preparedness. - They predict hazards such as floods, tsunamis, landslides, volcanoes, and droughts, and aim to reduce the risks associated with them. When it comes to military strength, most African countries are matching their peers in the West. Egypt in possession of several F-16 Fighting Falcon, South Africa boasting the Saab JAS 39 Gripen and Kenya running away with the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. But as the continent suffers the greatest impacts of climate change in form of extreme weather, African countries aren’t anywhere close to matching the worlds’ investment in weather forecasting infrastructure. The main types of disasters that have affected Africa are droughts and floods, which are all forecastable. Regrettably, the continent has the least developed land-based observation network of all continents and one that is in a deteriorating state. It’s the only continent in the 21st century where religious leaders and politicians still make weather pronouncements. Based on the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) database, Europe and the United States have a combined total of 636 weather radar stations for a population of 1.1 billion. In contrast, Africa, with a population of 1.2 billion people ,has 37 weather radar stations variably distributed across the continent. Africa needs to increase her funding in weather forecasting infrastructure. Early warning systems are an essential tool for risk management and disaster preparedness. They predict hazards such as floods, tsunamis, landslides, volcanoes and droughts, and aim to reduce the risks associated with them. An effective early warning is capable of saving many lives and reducing damage by 30 per cent if activated 24 hours before the event. A seven-day forecast can accurately predict the weather about 80 per cent of the time while a five-day forecast can accurately predict the weather approximately 90 per cent of the time. The atmosphere ‘forgets’ its current state in 14 days. That means that no matter what’s happening with the weather now, in 14 days the current situation can change in any direction. The 14 days are called the ‘theoretical limit’ of weather prediction. Every day of weather not recorded means that more crucial data is missing. For Africa, climate risks are expected to pose significant challenges to food security, biodiversity, poverty eradication, economic growth and human health. The implications of scarce meteorological data are severe. If the weather isn’t reliably recorded, weather models cannot be calibrated. Without accurate models, meteorologists cannot make accurate forecasts and warn people about upcoming extremes, nor can we build better-quality climate models. The lack of data has led to challenges in measuring the extent of climate change. Political leaders should note that the absence of hard numbers could make it difficult to prove global warming’s impact on the continent in accessing the Loss and damage fund. The Systematic Observations Financing Facility is a recent United Nations initiative to address climate and weather data gaps and to ensure that early warning systems are established wherever they’re needed. Africa needs long-term investment to develop climate science programmes, increase local meteorological expertise, maintain weather stations and digitise weather records. With the continent aware of where the shoe pinches, it must take the initiative not to be caught unawares.",

    "text": "U.S. Rep. Dale Strong (R-Monrovia) is calling for the use of AI and drones to deal with the drug problem at the southern border.\nDuring a Tuesday House Homeland Security Committee hearing about using unmanned aircraft systems for DHS, Strong discussed the use of drones and AI to target drug cartels who bring fentanyl over the border.\n“In the previous administration, for every drone flown by border patrol, the Mexican cartel flew 17,” Strong explained, “many times entering us airspace to land and offload pounds of fentanyl in an attempt to kill a generation of Americans.”\nThe congressman said that much of the technology that could be used to stop drones at the border is being developed in Huntsville.\n“What is most interesting in Huntsville, Alabama, we have the proven technology to neutralize that drone threat. We can intercept and do forensics, we can block their flight, or we can drop and destroy them. Our time is now.”\nJerry Hendrix, who is the Director of UAS Programs at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, testified in front of the committee and answered questions by Strong and other members of Congress about this issue of drones.\nHendrix said there needs to be some regulatory reforms dealing with use of drones for national security.\n“If you look at the county UAS side, for example, we deal with, and I mentioned these in the testimony, the different types of regulations that need to be adjusted to allow us to do a full set of testing in the county UAS area, whether it also be detection or mitigation,” Hendrix said.\nPresident Donald Trump signed an Executive Order designating the drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\nYaffee is a contributing writer to Yellowhammer News and hosts “The Yaffee Program” weekdays 9-11 a.m. on WVNN .

    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Severe storms moved through Louisville again on Thursday with winds that would knock down trees. In St. Matthews, a pick-up truck driver was driving down Grandview Avenue when a giant tree crushed his truck bed. It was a close call for the driver who was behind the wheel when the tree fell. In Jeffersontown, the storms led to property damage. Resident Sierra Edds believes a lightning bolt is responsible for a tree trunk that came crashing down on her home at about 5 p.m. She said it was the first time her family has faced damages as a result of weather. She added that every time she gets in her car, Edds admires her family's \"cute little house.\" \"Now look at it; it's kind of a slap in the face,\" Edds said. Now, they're working to remove the tree and cover the roof with a tarp, as it was punctured by tree branches. She said there were \"ripple effects\" to the damage, including some side panels of the home coming off and holes in the roof. Louisville Metrosafe was overwhelmed with emergency calls Thursday. A backyard garage in Jeffersontown was also crushed. The resident said the tree took down power and data lines with it. He said that because of the damage severity, it could take a while before the lines are reconnected. Numbers peaked at around 15,000 power outages for customers around Louisville. But downpours that began around 4:30 p.m. did not stop Savannah Bananas fans from watching the performance baseball game at Slugger Field in downtown Louisville. \"It's just rain,\" said Savannah Bananas fan Tom Robbins. \"I'm not going to die.\" One family that drove to the game from Indianapolis found a tree limb on their car, but it didn't damage their vehicle. \"It's just fine,\" said Jim Yeater. \"It just barely came down.\" Once the clouds parted, many people found the best in another stormy, summer day.

    "text": "In the heart of Taumarunui, a small town renowned for its lush landscapes and tranquil atmosphere, a transformation is quietly underway. The Lines Company (TLC) has embarked on a significant journey, one that promises to fortify the town’s lifelines. With a hefty $1.4 million pledged towards upgrading its electricity infrastructure, the project is not just about replacing the old with the new—it's about reimagining the future of energy supply in this community. As we stand midway through this ambitious endeavor, initiated in mid-January 2024, the promise of progress is both palpable and inspiring.\nThe Spark of Transformation\nThe essence of this project lies in its meticulous planning and execution. With over 50% of the work already completed, TLC's commitment to staying on schedule and within budget shines through. The task at hand involves the replacement of critical yet aging electricity assets, including power poles and crossarms, elements that are vital for the safe and reliable distribution of power. The choice of contractors for this significant task fell to Omexom, working alongside the dedicated staff from TLC's Taumarunui depot. Together, they form the backbone of this transformative project, ensuring each step is taken with precision and care.\nLighting the Way Amid Challenges\nHowever, progress of such magnitude does not come without its set of challenges. Approximately 1,500 households have experienced short-term power outages, a necessary inconvenience to pave the way for a more reliable future. Understanding the potential impact of these outages, TLC has taken proactive steps to work closely with the local community and businesses. Their approach has been one of transparency and collaboration, providing advance notice and working diligently to minimize disruptions. It’s a testament to TLC’s commitment not just to the project's physical execution but to maintaining the trust and support of the Taumarunui community.\nA Future Charged with Possibilities\nAs we look towards the completion of this upgrade, the horizon holds much promise for Taumarunui. The investment of $1.4 million is not just a financial figure; it represents a leap towards securing a more reliable and efficient energy supply for the future. Upon the project's completion, residents can look forward to an infrastructure robust enough to meet modern demands and flexible enough to adapt to future innovations. This upgrade project is a cornerstone in ensuring that the energy needs of Taumarunui’s residents are met with the diligence and foresight they deserve.\nIn the grand scheme of things, the ongoing project in Taumarunui is a microcosm of a broader narrative—a narrative that speaks to the resilience of communities and the importance of forward-thinking infrastructure investments. As TLC nears the completion of this critical upgrade, the anticipation within the community is palpable. It’s a story of progress, of embracing change, and of collectively moving towards a brighter, more sustainable future. And as this chapter in Taumarunui’s story unfolds, it sets a precedent for what community-focused, future-ready projects can achieve.",

Das Programm \"Wir stärken Mädchen - future ready (WSM)\" hat es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, die freie Berufswahl zu unterstützen und Gleichberechtigung zu fördern. Es wurde von der Deutschen Kinder- und Jugendstiftung zusammen mit der \"Stiftung RTL - Wir helfen Kindern e.\nV.\" initiiert. Auch die Deutsche Vermögensberatung (DVAG), Annabell Pohl und der gemeinnützige Verein \"DVAG hilft e. V.\" setzen sich dafür ein, Mädchen und jungen Frauen eine chancengerechte Zukunft zu ermöglichen. Mit der gemeinsamen Förderung konnten bereits zum dritten Mal fünf hessische Schulen an \"WSM\" teilnehmen.\nAnnabell Pohl besucht Marburger Schülerinnen zum Projektabschluss\nEine davon: die Marburger Elisabethschule. Dort war Annabell Pohl, Gründungsmitglied von \"DVAG hilft e. V.\", am 11. Juni zu Gast. Sie tauschte sich mit den Schülerinnen aus und informierte sich in einer Präsentation über die Abschlussprojekte der Teilnehmenden. Seit dem Auftakt im Herbst forschten die Mädchen mit ihren Lehrkräften zur Wasserqualität oder zur Vermeidung von Lebensmittelverschwendung. Annabell Pohl macht sich mit \"DVAG hilft e. V.\" aktiv für mehr Gleichberechtigung stark. \"Wir stärken Mädchen\" ist für sie ein echtes Herzensprojekt: \"Ich bin begeistert von den Ergebnissen. Man sieht, dass die Schülerinnen mit großem Engagement dabei waren. Durch die intensive Projektarbeit wurden viele wichtige Kompetenzen der Mädchen geschult und ausgebaut. Das hat sie selbstbewusster gemacht und ihnen neue Perspektiven aufgezeigt.\"\nSelbstbewusstsein stärken, Interesse an Wissenschaft und Technik fördern\nDie Themen aus den Bereichen Mathematik, Informatik, Naturwissenschaft und Technik (MINT) vermitteln nicht nur tiefere Einblicke als der Schulunterricht, sondern stärken auch Kreativität, Zusammenarbeit und kritisches Denken. Anna Brückner, Projektmanagerin bei der Deutschen Kinder- und Jugendstiftung, sagt: \"Wir freuen uns, dass wir den Teilnehmerinnen wertvolle Einblicke in den MINT-Bereich bieten konnten und sie dazu ermutigt haben, sich vorurteilsfrei und selbstbestimmt für einen Beruf zu entscheiden. Dass wir unser Programm auch im neuen Schuljahr dank der Unterstützung der DVAG wieder an Schulen in Hessen anbieten können, freut uns umso mehr.\"\nÜber die Deutsche Vermögensberatung Gruppe\nRund 8 Millionen Kunden setzen bei den Themen Absicherung, Altersvorsorge und Vermögensaufbau auf die Kompetenz und Erfahrung der Vermögensberaterinnen und Vermögensberater der Deutschen Vermögensberatung Unternehmensgruppe.

Mehr Infos gibt es unter: www. dvag-hilft.org.\nÜber \"Wir stärken Mädchen\"\n\"Wir stärken Mädchen\" ist ein Programm der Deutschen Kinder- und Jugendstiftung mit dem Ziel, Mädchen darin zu bestärken, selbstbestimmt und unabhängig von Stereotypen ihren eigenen Weg zu gehen. Mädchen und junge Frauen sind bis heute in vielen Berufsfeldern unterrepräsentiert, obwohl ihre schulischen Leistungen und Abschlüsse ihnen alle Türen öffnen. Berufswahlprozesse und -entscheidungen sind weiterhin stark vom Geschlecht geprägt. So sind Frauen bis heute in MINT-Berufen unterrepräsentiert, die Wahrscheinlichkeit ist geringer, dass sie ein eigenes Unternehmen gründen, und sie haben weiterhin weniger Chancen auf Führungspositionen als Männer.
