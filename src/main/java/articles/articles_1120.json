    "title": "New Mexico village rebuilds all over again after record-breaking flash flood kills 3 - The Boston Globe",
    "text": "RUIDOSO, N.M. (AP) — The mountain village of Ruidoso returned to the grim rituals of rebuilding after flash flooding and a deadly natural disaster, just one year after wildfire and intense flooding reshaped the popular vacation getaway and its surroundings.\nBroken tree limbs, twisted metal, crumpled cars and muddy debris remained as crews worked to clear roads and culverts in the wake of Tuesday’s flash flood that killed three people — including two children — and significantly damaged as many as 50 homes, with one home carried away entirely.\nTracy Haragan, a Ruidoso native on the verge of retirement, watched from his home as a surging river carried away the contents of nine nearby residences.\n“You watched everything they owned, everything they had — everything went down,” he said. “It is such a great town, it just takes a tail-whipping every once in a while. ... We always survive.”\nAdvertisement\nAn intense bout of monsoon rains set the disaster in motion Tuesday. Water rushed from the surrounding mountainside, overwhelming the Rio Ruidoso and taking with it a man and two children from an RV park along the river. The bodies were found downstream during search and rescue efforts.\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up The children — a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy — had been camping with their parents when they were swept away. The father and mother were being treated for injuries at a hospital in Texas, according to officials at Fort Bliss, where the father is stationed.\nMayor Lynn Crawford said hearts are broken over the lives lost and stomachs are in knots as residents begin to take stock of the damage.\nAdvertisement\nRebuilding — again A popular summer retreat, Ruidoso is no stranger to tragedy. It has spent a year rebuilding following destructive wildfires last summer and the flooding that followed.\nRebuilding again in Ruidoso will be hard, if not impossible, said Riverside RV Park owner Barbara Arthur.\nArthur says her guests scrambled up a nearby slope when the river started coursing through the site Tuesday afternoon. She also lost her home in flood.\nIt was the sixth time the river rose in the last several weeks and by far the worst, she said. And Tuesday’s rainfall was more than could be absorbed by the hillsides and canyons within a wildfire burn scar.\nSetting records The floodwaters of the Rio Ruidoso rose more than 20 feet (6 meters) on Tuesday to set a new record high-water mark, said National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Shoemake in Albuquerque. That eclipsed the previously recorded high in July 2024 by nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters).\nAbout 3.5 inches (8.9 centimeters) of rain fell over the South Fork burn scar in just an hour and a half, Crawford said. As little as a quarter of an inch (about 6 millimeters) of rain over a burn scar can cause flooding.\n“They were probably already getting some runoff from upstream before it even actually started raining on top of the wildfire burn scar,” Shoemake said. “It really was just kind of a terrible coincidence of events that led to that.”\nHe likened the intense rainfall to a 100-year storm, which has a 1% chance of happening in any given year.\nCleanup begins Emergency crews completed dozens of swift water rescues before the water receded Tuesday. Two National Guard teams and several local crews already were in the area when the flooding began, said Danielle Silva of the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.\nAdvertisement\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham requested a presidential disaster declaration, tallying more than $50 million in emergency response expenditures, including water rescues, and damage to public infrastructure, including toppled bridges and washed out roadways. The estimate includes flood damage at Ruidoso and beyond from monsoon rainstorms since late June.\nRuidoso has also recently requested $100 million in federal aid to convert flood-prone private land to public property after successive years of violent flooding laid bare the dangers of an expanded floodplain.\nThe floods at Ruidoso came just days after flash floods in Texas killed more than 100 people and left more than 160 people missing.\nBracing for more Local officials said the village, as the flood hit, was still in the process of replacing outdoor warning sirens destroyed in last year’s wildfire and reassessing risks along the local flood plain.\nCrawford reiterated Wednesday that Ruidoso will continue to be in the crosshairs with each monsoon, as there’s still work to do to recover from the wildfire. The rainy season begins in June and runs through September.\nThe river, meanwhile, is running thick with sediment that can settle and raise future water levels.\nThe village’s tourism-based economy also has been thrown into turmoil again. With floodwaters running through Ruidoso Downs, one of the horse track’s signature races that was scheduled to start Friday has been derailed.\nThe mayor said people are anxious as the monsoon is sure to bring more rain throughout the summer.\n“Yesterday was a good lesson — you know, that Mother Nature is a much bigger, powerful force than we are,” he said Wednesday. “And that we can do a lot of things to protect ourselves and to try to help direct and whatever, but we cannot control.”\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "OK, the joke's just lying there, waiting. Somebody has to pick it up.\nLadies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to...The Confederacy Of Dunces.\nGovernor Greg Abbott is sucking around to be the Orval Faubus, Ross Barnett, and George Wallace of the 21st Century and most of the Republican governors around the country are joining in on his little Jeff Davis Memorial Project down at the southern border. So far, Kevin Stitt (Oklahoma), Jeff Landry (Louisiana), Brian Kemp (Georgia) Kristi Noem (South Dakota), Greg Gianforte (Montana), and Ron DeSantis (Florida) have joined Abbott in the Articles of Confederation Defense Fund. And now, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's saying out loud that federal immigration policy is now being set by a sexual predator toting around 91 federal indictments, this movement now has its Clement Vallandigham as well. From MSNBC:\nMcConnell, who has been willing to occasionally ignore the former president’s legislative priorities, is now prepared to bow to Trump’s demands. As Punchbowl News reported overnight, the Senate minority leader told his members , in reference to the party’s presumptive 2024 nominee, “We don’t want to do anything to undermine him.” The president should nationalize the Texas National Guard yesterday and put a stop to this before it truly gets out of hand. (Tentherism is another one of those loopy rightist ideas that modern conservatism has entertained for decades, long before the former president* turned all those existing ideas loose.) My major concern is that both the Texas Guard and the Border Patrol may be so seriously compromised by MAGA sympathizers that actual brawls may break out all along the borderline.\nAnd I was just musing that we seem to be on the brink of an actual federal-state crack-up, and over an issue that may well damage this country's alliances with a huge chunk of North America, and over an issue that, in Washington, the issue is also threatening collaterally to kill off aid to Ukraine, so I was musing what element of this tangled and volatile situation Vladimir Putin wouldn't enjoy.\nRelated Story Who Is Charles Koch When He's At Home?

    "title": "Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Bowls with Chili-Lime Dressing",
    "text": "As a\nCeliac girlie, one of my go-tos for a safe, easy meal when I’m out and about is Chipotle. I’ve been eating their burrito bowls since before going gluten free so it feels like a “normal” meal that I never had to give up. That actually means a lot!\nWhile Chipotle’s burrito bowls have always been there for me, their price increases have done me dirty. What used to be an $8 meal now costs nearly $20. TWENTY DOLLARS. I mean of course I get a scoop of guacamole in my bowl, and of course I get a bag of chips with gluten free queso on the side, and of COURSE I round up for charity when checking out, but still — $20?!\nThere’s a better way, and it goes by the name of Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Bowls with Chili-Lime Dressing. These fresh, healthy, filling bowls are made with humble, inexpensive ingredients, and pack a nutritious punch. They keep me full for hours and don’t cost an arm and a leg to assemble!\nHealthy + Gluten Free + Vegan Lunch\nThese sweet potato black bean bowls are an excellent option for lunch because they’re filling yet light (aka you won’t need a nap after eating) and meatless. I try to eat meat free before dinnertime so this recipe fits the bill for me.\nAdditionally, while it’s full of fresh vegetables and healthy ingredients, this dish is NOT a cold salad. During the season that shall not be named, a chilled, lettuce-based salad is the the last thing I crave. The combination of warm rice and roasted sweet potatoes with fresh lettuce and toppings puts these bowls into the healthy yet cozy meal category.\nIngredients Needed\nBetween the cilantro-lime rice, sweet potatoes, and chili-lime dressing, these bowls have a few hands-on components, but they come together quickly and several are make ahead too. Also several ingredients like extra virgin olive oil, chili powder, lime juice, and salt and pepper are used in several of the components. Here’s what you’ll need:\nFor the Sweet Potatoes:\n- Sweet potatoes: you’ll need 2lbs which is ~4 small sweet potatoes. Peel then chop them into 1″ cubes.\n- Seasonings: chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder lend a smoky + savory contrast to the sweet potatoes. Add salt and pepper to taste as well.\n- Extra virgin olive oil: for roasting.\nFor the Chili-Lime Dressing:\n- Extra virgin olive oil: feel free to use vegetable oil if you prefer.\n- Fresh lime juice: for the acid portion of the dressing.\n- Mayonnaise: gives the dressing a bit of creaminess. Use vegan mayonnaise to keep the recipe vegan. You could also use plain Greek Yogurt.\n- Honey: to balance out the tart lime juice.\n- Chili powder: is delicious with the lime juice and honey!\n- Salt and pepper: to taste.\nFor the Cilantro-Lime Rice:\n- Long grain white rice: I am brand loyal to Lundberg Farms white jasmine rice which is a great, high-quality rice.\n- Extra virgin olive oil and salt: to flavor the rice.\n- Chopped cilantro: stirred in at the end for a pop of freshness.\n- Fresh lime juice: pairs with the chopped cilantro to give you that classic, craveable Chipotle-rice flavor.\nFor the Toppings:\n- Black beans: simply drain then rinse a can of black beans before scooping into each bowl. You could use pinto beans if you prefer!\n- Red onion: thinly slice for a fresh and spicy bite. If you don’t love the flavor of raw onions, dice the red onion then roast it with the sweet potatoes for a more mild and sweet flavor.\n- Jalapeno: thinly slice then scatter on top of the bowls. DYK: the larger the jalapeno the less spicy it is? Feel free to use pickled jalapenos instead of fresh if you prefer.\n- Avocado: fresh avocado gives each bite a cool and creamy flavor and texture.\n- Arugula: I love the flavor of spicy arugula, though baby spinach, mixed greens, or even shredded lettuce are all great options.\nHow to Make Ahead of Time\nAs I mentioned, several components of this recipe can be prepped or made ahead of time. Here are my recommendations:\n- For the sweet potatoes: either store the peeled and chopped sweet potatoes in a bowl of water in the refrigerator for up to 4 days before patting dry and roasting, OR roast the sweet potatoes according to recipe directions then cool to room temperature and store in the refrigerator. You can heat them up in the microwave before eating or add them to your bowl cold.\n- For the Chili-Lime Dressing: make up to 5 days ahead of time and store in the fridge. It gets better as it sits!\n- For the black beans: drain and rinse up to 5 days ahead of time then store in an airtight container in the fridge.\n- For the red onion and jalapeno: slice then store in an airtight container in the fridge up to 3 days ahead of time.\nWait to dice the avocado and make the cilantro-lime rice before serving.\nGreat for Meal Prep\nWhile I enjoy eating this bowl warm, it truly is just as delicious cold which makes it great for meal prep.\nLayer the ingredients in large, wide-mouth mason jars with a tight fitting lid or pack in Pyrex containers. Voila — easy, healthy, make ahead lunches! Wait to add the dressing until it’s time to eat.\nPump Up the Protein\nWhile the roasted sweet potato black bean bowls are meatless — and plenty filling on their own — if you want to add meat, it’d be totally delicious. Here are my recs:\n- Chopped\nroasted chickenor chicken thighs Sliced grilled steak Sauteedor roasted shrimp Pulled pork\nAlrighty, let’s eat!\nHow to Make Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Bowls\nStep 1: Roast the sweet potatoes.\nStart by placing 2lbs of peeled and diced sweet potatoes onto a half sheet pan lined with parchment paper or nonstick-sprayed foil. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil then season with chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper\nToss with your fingertips to coat then spread the sweet potatoes into an even layer and roast at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until they’re tender and browned.\nWhen I tell you 1/4 of these never make it from the sheet pan to the bowls, I am not exaggerating. SO delicious!\nStep 2: Make the Cilantro-Lime Rice.\nMeanwhile, to a small / medium-size saucepan add long grain white rice, water, salt, and extra virgin olive oil then bring to a simmer. Once simmering, place a lid on top, turn the heat down to low, then simmer until the rice is tender, 12-15 minutes.\nAdd chopped cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice then stir to combine.\nStep 3: Make the Chili-Lime Dressing.\nAs I mentioned, this zippy dressing can be made up to 5 days ahead of time! To a mason jar with a tight fitting lid, or a mixing bowl, add extra virgin olive oil, fresh lime juice, mayonnaise (or plain Greek Yogurt), honey, chili powder, salt, and pepper, then shake or whisk to combine.\nTaste then add more fresh lime juice for tartness, honey for sweetness, and/or mayo for less tartness.\nStep 4: Assemble.\nAssembly time! This recipe makes enough for 5-6 bowls, so to each bowl add a scoop of warm Cilantro-Lime Rice and roasted sweet potatoes, plus drained then rinsed canned black beans, thinly sliced red onion, diced avocado, sliced jalapeno, and a handful of fresh greens.\nDrizzle with the creamy Chili-Lime Dressing then devour! I hope you love these gorgeous, healthy, filling bowls as much as I do — enjoy!\nMore Healthy Bowl-Style Meals\nSpicy Tuna Roll Bowls Greek Chicken Bowls Steak and Potato Bowls Vegetable Fajita Toastada Bowls Chicken Power Bowls\nfree email bonus\nDinner Made EASY\n5 days of simple yet flavorful recipes that take the stress out of dinnertime!\nRoasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Bowls with Chili-Lime Dressing\nDescription\nRoasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Bowls with Chili-Lime Dressing are healthy, plant-based bowls packed with flavor, texture, and staying power!\nIngredients\n- 15oz can black beans, drained then rinsed\n- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced\n- 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced\n- 2 avocado, diced\n- 4 cups arugula (or baby spinach, or mixed greens)\n- For the sweet potatoes:\n- 2lbs sweet potato (~4 small), peeled then sliced into 1\" cubes\n- 2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon chili powder\n- 1 teaspoon onion powder\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n- salt and pepper, to taste\n- For the Chili-Lime Dressing:\n- 6 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice (~2 limes)\n- 2 Tablespoons mayonnaise (or plain Greek Yogurt)\n- 1 Tablespoon honey\n- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder\n- salt and pepper, to taste\n- For the Cilantro-Lime Rice:\n- 1-3/4 cups water\n- 1 cup long grain white rice, I like Lundberg Farms White Jasmine Rice\n- 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro\n- juice of 1/2 lime (may not need all)\nDirections\n- For the sweet potatoes: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees then line a half sheet pan with parchment paper or nonstick-sprayed foil.

    "title": "Antes de Emma Stone esta actriz de Harry Potter perdió su papel en 'La La Land' por exigencias sin sentido",
    "text": "Emma Stone ha construido una carrera muy sólida en Hollywood y cada vez sorprende al público con su versatilidad. Tan solo este año ha recibido cientos de elogios con su protagónico en Poor Things, la nueva película de Yorgos Lánthimos, una de las grandes contrincantes para los premios Oscar 2024. Mientras que en los Globos del Oro, la serie The Curse, en la que también es protagonista, ha recibido varias nominaciones. Dos géneros completamente diferentes en la que la actriz ha logrado brillar y cautivar al público.\nSi bien, su carrera cuenta con varios proyectos icónicos, uno de los favoritos del público y la crítica es, sin duda, La La Land en la que comparte créditos con Ryan Gosling, la estrella de Barbie. La química del dúo fue suficiente para convertirse en una de las parejas más entrañables de Hollywood. Además, la historia solo confirmó a Damien Chazelle como uno de los cineastas más prometedores de la industria, pues años atrás ya había mostrado su potencial con Whiplash.\nA pesar de obtener un Oscar por su papel de Mia, Stone no fue la primera opción para el personaje, de hecho, una de las candidatas más fuertes fue Emma Watson, conocida por su estelar en la famosa saga de Harry Potter, en la que interpretó a Hermione Granger. Mientras que para el papel de Sabastián fue seleccionado Miles Teller, con quien Chazelle ya había trabajado en su ópera prima. Sin embargo, la actriz de Mujercitas fue descartada de inmediato debido a sus altas exigencias.\nDe acuerdo con un artículo de Page Six, la excompañera de Daniel Radcliffe y Rupert Grint exigió que los ensayos de la película se hicieran en Londres, cuando la preproducción estaba programa en Los Ángeles. Aunque no detallaron más al respecto, años después la actriz aclararía que tuvo que rechazar la oferta ya que coincidía con el rodaje del live acción de La Bella y la Bestia, por lo que tuvo que poner la producción de Disney sobre la de Chazelle.\nPor otro lado, el actor de Top Gun Maverick exigió un desorbitante salario. “A Miles Teller se le ofreció USD 4 millones, pero él dijo que quería USD 6 millones”, reveló una fuente a Page Six. Considerando que la producción tuvo un presupuesto de 30 millones de dólares, su propuesta simplemente pareció descabellada, además de que el actor tiene fama de ser muy difícil para trabajar en set.\nFinalmente, Stone y Gosling fueron fichados para el papel y la película alcanzó la impresionante cantidad de 14 nominaciones al Oscar, incluyendo Mejor Película, un premio que ya tenían en sus manos pero que les fue arrebatado tras un error garrafal de los organizadores, el cual originalmente le pertenecía a Moonlight.",

    "text": "BHPian Aceman82 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\nI got the dreaded HV critical error today. The car had around 32% state of charge (SOC) when the HV Critical error appeared. The vehicle is approximately 1.5 years old and has only been driven for about 5,000 km. It's primarily used for school runs and is the third car in our garage.\nThe HV critical error suddenly appeared at around 32% SOC, and the vehicle went into limp mode before coming to a full stop. I turned off the car and restarted it; the error went away, but the car was operating with reduced performance. I drove it to my home garage and parked it, at which point the HV alert appeared once more.\nI tried to charge the car, but the alert keeps popping up, and it refuses to charge. I'll need to call Roadside Assistance (RSA) tomorrow and request a tow to the service center if it fails to charge in the morning as well.\nIf a vehicle with only 5,000 km on it experiences battery issues, what are the chances of reliability in a high-mileage vehicle? Who would want to own such a car outside of warranty?\nThis is my third car in the garage (I have two other cars and two two-wheelers), so I don't mind it being in the service center for extended periods. Saying that, My 8 year old XUV500 would had less service centre visits than the 1.5 year old Tiago EV .\nThis is quickly turning out to be a garage queen where one needs infinite money and patience to keep a EV car from Tata.\nWill keep this thread posted on updates to the Battery issue.\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

    "text": "Le petit enfant brésilien de 4 ans était moqué à l’école en raison de ses longs cheveux. Par L.M Publié le 28/12/2023 à 23:12 Temps de lecture: 1 min C ’est la chouette vidéo du jour ! Un jeune brésilien de 4 ans qui subissait du harcèlement dans son école primaire a reçu le soutien de son joueur préféré : Erling Haaland !\nDepuis tout petit, le petit Vini est moqué suite à sa coupe de cheveux : ils sont longs et arrivent aux épaules du petit garçon. La mère du petit enfant, Angelica raconte l’histoire de son fils au journal brésilien du Globo : « Chaque jour, les gens lui disaient : ‘Ce sont des cheveux de filles, pas de garçons. Coupe-les, ce n’est pas joli.’ Il était triste parce qu’ils l’appelaient une fille ».\nUn jour un de ses camarades vient voir la maman de Vini et lui demande s’il peut l’appeler Haaland, en raison de la ressemblance au niveau de la coupe de cheveux. La mère accepte et le petit Vini commence à s’intéresser de plus en plus à la star norvégienne jusqu’à en devenir son fan numéro un : « Maman, il est beau et il a des cheveux comme les miens ! »\nPour fêter ses 4 ans, le petit garçon a réalisé une fête spéciale « Haaland » avec des photos de l’attaquant de Manchester City un peu partout. En postant la vidéo sur Instagram et en identifiant le joueur, Erling Haaland a pu prendre connaissance de l’histoire de Vini et a décidé, en guise de cadea de Noël de lui dédicacer une petite vidéo dans laquelle il lui apporte tout son soutien et lui dit d’être fier de ses longs cheveux !",

    "text": "A surface does more than simply cover a space—it transforms it, infusing personality, rhythm, and soul. It evolves from being a mere backdrop to becoming an active element that shapes the atmosphere through the interplay of material, form, and light. The balance of the touch, the thickness, incisions, tones, and luminous reflections can transform surfaces into sensory experiences. Textures can evoke stability or lightness, grooves introduce dynamism, colors define moods, and light sculpts depth and movement. Ceramic, with its aesthetic and functional versatility, is particularly well-suited to this role, offering architects a broad palette of creative possibilities.\n[Fiandre](https://www.granitifiandre.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com), a renowned manufacturer of porcelain surfaces, has introduced its latest collection, [Tribute100](https://www.granitifiandre.com/tribute100?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com), that combines innovative aesthetics with sustainability. Paying homage to the iconic Serie 100, launched in 2010 and celebrated for incorporating a high percentage of recycled materials, this new collection renews that commitment by reinterpreting sustainable design. It reutilizes resources, values their intrinsic memory, and reduces environmental impact.\nInspired by the timeless qualities of nature, the collection recreates the look and feel of marble, stone, and other luxurious surfaces in sustainable porcelain pieces. Available in versatile formats, it is ideal for a variety of applications, including wall coverings, flooring, countertops, and even furniture. The collection also stands out for its exceptional durability, resisting scratches, stains, and thermal shocks. Additionally, its non-porous surface is easy to clean and inhibits the growth of bacteria and mold, making it particularly appropriate for kitchens, bathrooms, and healthcare spaces.\nThe collection innovates by exploring the interplay between surface and light, a defining aspect of contemporary design. Available in three modular sizes—120x60 cm, 60x60 cm, and 60x30 cm—the surfaces offer versatility for creative applications, from flooring and wall coverings to custom projects. Enriched with intricate three-dimensional patterns, these surfaces transform under different lighting conditions, creating dynamic and engaging effects. Key designs include [Paint](https://www.granitifiandre.com/porcelain-slab/tribute-100/pearl-paint?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com), inspired by bold industrial brushstrokes that lend expressive and modern textures; [Fold](https://www.granitifiandre.com/porcelain-slab/tribute-100/shark-fold?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com), which draws on the soft irregularity of crumpled paper to add elegance and movement; and [Net](https://www.granitifiandre.com/porcelain-slab/tribute-100/mink-net?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com), featuring a delicate lattice of metallic and silky threads that exude sophistication and precision. The use of metallic glazes adds a subtle yet sophisticated sheen, bringing the pieces to life as they respond to both natural and artificial light, revealing depth and dynamism from different angles. The four color options enhance the collection's versatility:\n- Pearl: A luminous, iridescent white that bathes spaces in radiant light, enhancing sensory and aesthetic experiences. Its patterns reveal glimmers of brilliance that shift and transform with the light.\n- Shark: A deep gray with a fluid quality that alternates between solid and liquid impressions. Its laminated textures create grooves and subtle shadows that ripple with rhythmic highlights.\n- Mink: A warm, earthy tone with a silky finish that exudes sophistication. Its layered patterns explore a rich spectrum of brown, delivering a soft, contemporary aesthetic.\n- Titanium: A perfectly balanced neutral shade with warm and cool tones. Subtle gold accents dance across the textured surfaces, adding depth and a discreet sense of luxury.\nThe ongoing dialogue between light, texture, and material creates environments that transcend functionality, offering an engaging and emotional aesthetic while awakening new senses in visitors. With this approach, the collection not only celebrates the timeless beauty of surfaces but also invites us to rethink environmental impact and explore the infinite possibilities of modern design.\nLearn more about the collection on [Fiandre's official website](https://www.granitifiandre.com/porcelain-slab/tribute-100?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com).",
