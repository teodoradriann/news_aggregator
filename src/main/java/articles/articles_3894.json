    "title": "Toledo, Pitt wrap season of bigger dreams in GameAbove Sports Bowl | | news-journal.com",
    "text": "One day after Christmas, Pittsburgh and Toledo meet in Detroit in the GameAbove Sports Bowl hoping to put a bow on a 2024 season that began with bigger wishes. The Panthers (7-5) were No. 18 in the initial 2024 College Football Playoff rankings on Nov. 5, three days after suffering their first loss at SMU. However, that 48-25 defeat to the Mustangs was the start of a five-game skid that ran the rest of the regular season. Injuries plagued Pitt in November. Quarterback Eli Holstein missed the Nov. 16 game against Clemson after suffering a head injury the week prior in the loss to Virginia. The freshman returned to start against Louisville on Nov. 23, but he didn't make it out of the first quarter after injuring his left ankle. That caused him to miss the last game against Boston College. Several offensive line injuries also affected the team during the skid, and an undisclosed ailment kept Desmond Reid, the Panthers' second-team All-American all-purpose back, out against Boston College. \"I would imagine on the 26th we're going to be a heck of a lot healthier than we were coming out of that BC game,\" coach Pat Narduzzi said to reporters during a press conference for the bowl earlier this month. \"I promise you that.\" Narduzzi hopes Holstein can play. In 10 games, the signal caller completed nearly 62 percent of his throws for 2,228 yards, 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions. It could become an issue since Nate Yarnell, who threw for 1,056 yards and 10 TDs with five picks, entered the transfer portal. David Lynch, who threw just nine passes this season, would back up, the coach said. Reid ran for 797 yards and four touchdowns and caught 47 passes for 564 yards and four scores. He also averaged 12.3 yards on a dozen punt returns, one of which was returned for a TD. Pitt also has an All-American on defense. Linebacker Kyle Louis registered 16 tackles for loss, including seven sacks. He also picked off four passes, scoring on one. The Rockets (7-5), who ended the season with consecutive losses, are bowl bound for the fourth straight season. Toledo sports the best passing attack in the Mid-American Conference, averaging 246.2 yards a game. Tucker Gleason threw for 2,457 yards and has a 22-to-7 touchdown-to-interception ratio. Jerjuan Newton caught 64 passes for 949 yards and a MAC-leading 11 scores. The defense, led by safety Maxen Hook (107 tackles, two interceptions), allows an average of five yards a play. That ranks 27th in the country. Coach Jason Candle, who is one win away from matching Gary Pinkel for the most victories in school history (73), said at the press conference the game gives the seniors one last chance to celebrate their careers, many of which will end this week, while giving underclassmen additional practices that can pay off next season. \"This is a reward for having a great year,\" the ninth-year coach said. \"You want to finish it off the right way, and you want to do a great job of balancing what it looks like for the future of your program. I think if this is handled the right way, it kind of sets the culture and the tempo for what your offseason starting point is in January or February.\" --Field Level Media\nOriginally published on fieldlevelmedia.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",

    "title": "Canada Post confirms it is laying off striking workers",
    "text": "Canada Post has confirmed that it is laying off striking postal workers following a union complaint that workers were getting layoff phone calls as a “scare tactic.”\nIn a statement to the Star, Canada Post said the layoffs are temporary.\n“Our business has been significantly impacted leading up to and throughout this labour disruption. We have taken steps to adjust our operations,” Canada Post said. “That means the previously expired collective agreements no longer apply and the terms and conditions of employment for employees have therefore changed.”\nThe Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) posted in a bulletin Monday that Canada Post had been “calling CUPW members to lay them off.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Carl Girourard, the union’s national grievance officer, wrote that the calls “are merely a scare tactic” and that workers should not “panic if (they) receive such a call.”\nCanada Post said that “a limited number of employees” have been impacted by the layoffs and that employees who “have been laid off have been contacted directly.”\nCUPW confirmed in a statement to the Star that Canada Post had begun laying off its members, but did not specify the number of workers laid off.\nTalks ‘grind to a halt’ between union and Canada Post as federal mediator suspends talks\nEarlier in November, Canada Post issued a lockout notice but said it didn’t intend to lock out employees, instead saying the notice would allow the company to make changes to its operations in order to respond to the effects of a strike.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Larry Savage, a professor of labour studies at Brock University, said layoffs are “a very aggressive move by Canada Post that seem designed to scare union members into abandoning their strike.”\n“I think as we inch closer to the holiday season,” Savage said, “government intervention becomes more and more likely.”\nOn Wednesday, federal Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon said that the special federal mediator was suspending mediated talks between the two parties after Canada Post said talks had “ground to a halt.”\n“This pause in mediation activities will hopefully permit the parties to reassess their positions and return to the bargaining table with renewed resolve,” MacKinnon wrote on the social media platform X .\nOn Thursday, MacKinnon wrote that he spoke with striking CUPW workers in Vancouver to “hear about what is important to them in this dispute.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Daniel Tisch, the president and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, called the strike “an economic risk to Canada” in a statement Wednesday.\n“Instead of thriving during the holidays, businesses face delays, damaged reputations, and lost sales,” Tisch wrote.\nStriking workers have a legal right to return to their jobs when the strike ends, said David J. Doorey, a professor of labour and employment law at York University, “unless those jobs no longer exist.\n“It may be that a lack of work at that point results in some employees being laid-off, at least temporarily, but that is just hypothetical at this point.”\nA key issue in bargaining has been a push to expand parcel deliveries into the weekend, but the union and Canada Post are at odds over how to make it work.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Canada Post has been struggling to compete with other delivery providers and posted a $315 million loss before tax in its third quarter, and has pitched weekend deliveries as a way to boost revenue.\nOn Thursday, CUPW members rallied outside Canada Post’s corporate headquarters in Ottawa.\nWith files from The Canadian Press.",

    "text": "News / Scotland\nTravel disruption expected as heavy snow forecast across Scotland The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow that comes into effect at midnight on Sunday.\nSTV News Forecasters warn some areas of Scotland will see 'significant' snowfall this weekend. STV News Beth Franklin Friday, January 3rd, 2025 Share this story\nFacebook\nX / Twitter\nCopy Link\nPosted in Weather Heavy snow is expected to cause travel disruption across Scotland as wintry conditions continue into next week.\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning that comes into place at midnight on Sunday and expires at 12pm on Monday.\nThe warning covers central Scotland, Aberdeenshire, the Highlands, the Scottish Borders, and Strathclyde.\nForecasters warned that outbreaks of snow will likely develop on Sunday, with some affected areas seeing “significant” snowfall.\nThe Met Office said the greatest risk is in southern and eastern Scotland, where up to 5cm of snow may accumulate in quite a few places and as much as 10-20cm over higher ground.\nRain or sleet is more likely near some northern and eastern coasts.\nThe Met Office also warned there is a chance of travel disruption and that some rural communities could become cut off.\nAn amber warning for snow has also been issued for parts of England and Wales.\nThe new warning comes after multiple warnings for snow and ice have been in place throughout the week.\nFriday has a warning for ice after temperatures plummeted overnight with some parts of Scotland reaching -6.4C.\nInsight Philip Petrie STV Weather presenter\nLast night, temperatures dropped to lows of -6.4c in Eskdalemuir, -4.7c in Salsburgh, -4.6c at Tyndrum and -4.1c at Tulloch Bridge. We saw a fairly widespread frost and further wintry showers moving into the north, bringing further snowfall accumulations.\nAs of 6am this morning, locations such as Dyce in Aberdeenshire and Loch Glascarnoch in the north-west Highlands were reporting 8cm of snow and 4cm of snow at Altnaharra in Caithness & Sutherland.\nMet Office weather warnings are in force until 10am this morning, but even after that, we will see some impacts throughout the day. We have a snow and ice warning covering the Northern Isles and parts of the northwest Highlands, Angus, Moray, Aberdeenshire and Argyll & Bute. This is because we have further wintry showers moving in, but generally, these will fizzle out throughout the morning and into the afternoon.\nFurther west, an Ice warning covers the Western Isles, stretching down much of the western side of the country. With temperatures dropping below freezing quite widely and struggling to recover throughout the morning, there will definitely be icy roads and pavements.\nCome Saturday, it’s not looking too bad overall. There are plenty of sunny spells around, with some showers—again, these will be most prominent around the north and west of the country. But on the whole, it’s a largely dry day, but it’s still bitterly cold out and about.\nSunday is the day we need to watch. An area of low pressure starts to move in from the southwest, bringing with it a band of rain. As that rain bumps into the colder air, it will bring heavy snow across central and southern Scotland, with the snow continuing to develop overnight into Monday.\nThis is why we already have a yellow weather warning for snow covering the vast majority of central Scotland. It comes into effect at midnight Sunday and runs until midday Monday.\nThe snow could end up being quite disruptive if the current models follow through, but if the low pressure moves a bit further south, then there is a chance the heaviest snowfall will impact more southern parts of the UK. As always, we will be keeping an eye on this over the next 24 hours.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country\nFollow STV News\nFollow STV News on WhatsApp Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country\nPosted in Weather",

Mayor Lamar Hernandez-Thorpe, who sets the agenda, requested an extension because of the delay, noting the requester – Antioch’s Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment – had done so in a timely fashion. “I reviewed the request and thought it was a great idea,” the mayor said of the flag flying in what is now one of the Bay Area’s most diverse cities. Mayor Pro-Tem Monica Wilson moved for approval, with an extension until Juneteenth, the June 19 holiday that commemorates the end of slavery. Unlike past requests for other flags, this one received unanimous support on Tuesday. After much controversy, Antioch approved its first flag flying policy on a split vote in 2022, allowing the Progress Pride flag to be flown for the first time outside City Hall. All flag requests must now come before the council for approval before being flown. “If there are any flags that are requested to be flown in the interim, we can certainly fly them as well,” Hernandez-Thorpe said. “So this does not preclude other flags from being flown.” Some other area cities that fly the Pan-African flag include Richmond, Emeryville, Oakland and Tracy. Leslie May told the council she was proud of her heritage, which is African and Native American, and she would like to see the flag flown all year. “I would like to see this flown in honor of me, my ancestors before me and the ancestors before them,” she said. “Since we were forced to come over here to this land, we lost our opportunity for the real (African) flag to be flown.” Antioch-ACCE member Tachina Garrett thanked the council for raising the flag. “This flag was created to give Black people in America and the world a symbol that unifies the diaspora,” she said. “The red, which symbolizes our blood that was shed. The black symbolizes those bodies that were beaten and burned and everything else, and the green represents the land that was stolen.” The Pan-African flag was developed by activist Marcus Garvey and others in response to racism as a symbol to connect people of African descent across the world. It is also known as the Black Liberation flag and the Afro-American flag, and was adopted by the UNIA at a conference in New York City in 1920.",

    "text": "Britain is being battered by a tidal wave of festive flu, health chiefs warned today.\nSurveillance programs monitoring the current flu outbreak in the UK indicate that flu-related hospital admissions in England have already exceeded last year’s peak and are currently at their highest level this winter.\nFigures show more than 2,600 beds alone have been taken up by flu patients, an increase of almost 40 per cent on last week (1,795).\nOf these, 125 were in critical care — up 90 per cent on the previous seven days.\nRates of the winter vomiting bug norovirus, meanwhile, are also almost 25 per cent higher than expected for this time of year.\nHealth officials are concerned that the number of cases will continue to rise in the upcoming weeks due to increased social gatherings indoors during the holiday season.\nThey are advising individuals experiencing symptoms like cough, sore throat, or runny nose to avoid contact with high-risk groups such as the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health conditions to prevent potential severe illness from the virus.\nIt comes as experts have already warned the health service must brace itself for a ‘quad-demic’ driven the four winter illnesses — flu, covid, norovirus and cold-like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\nSurveillance programmes that monitor the UK’s outbreak suggest flu hospital admissions in England have already surpassed last year’s peak and are running at their highest level so far this winter\nRSV, which is most common in infants and young children, was 25 per cent higher in the week ending December 17, than the previous year.\nNHS national medical director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said: ‘The NHS has been hit hard with an early festive flu season, putting increased pressure on staff as they prepare for the long winter ahead of us.\n‘In response to the flood of flu cases so early in the season, the NHS has been making it as easy as possible for people to get protected with a jab, including vaccination centres in supermarket car parks and football clubs.\n‘As children finish school and friends and families congregate over the Christmas period we expect viruses to continue to spread.\n‘So if you haven’t got your flu jab and are eligible please come forward, and the public should think twice about seeing loved ones if they are seriously unwell.\n‘I would remind anyone who needs medical support to continue to use 999 and A&E in an emergency and for everything else, use NHS 111 or 111 online.’\nPeople who are aged over 65, those with long term health conditions, pregnant women, care home residents and carers are eligible for a free jab.\nThere are signs that calls for eligible Brits to roll up their sleeves and get jabbed have been heard.\nNHS England said staff had now delivered a total of 28.5 million vaccines since the start of September.\nToday marks the last day to book winter vaccinations online or via NHS 111 for an appointment at a local vaccination site.\nFrom Friday, Brits will only be able to visit a Covid walk-in vaccination site or attend a pharmacy to get the jab.\nFears of a bad flu year come just days after experts warned this year’s flu vaccine could be 30 per cent less effective than hoped.\nThe flu vaccine is changed each year based on data from countries in the southern hemisphere, like Australia and New Zealand ,who have their winter season six months before Britain.\nThis is because the same types of flu that struck those countries usually goes on to cause the majority of cases in the UK.\nHowever, sometimes this forecasting is wrong.\nIn 2017, a mismatched flu vaccine was responsible for 50,000 extra deaths in the UK, according to the Office of National Statistics.\nData suggests the flu jab used in the southern hemisphere, which the one being rolled out in the UK is based on, could be up to 30 per cent less effective than normal.\nExperts consider a successful flu jab to be one that prevents people from needing hospital care for the virus in about 7 in 10 cases.\nHowever, data from countries like Australia and New Zealand, suggests the latest jab only stopped 4 in 10 hospitalisations.\nFlu, also called influenza, is responsible for about 40,000 hospitalisations and more than 10,000 deaths in the UK every year, though this can be higher in bad years.\nThe symptoms typically include fever, sore throat, muscle aches and a cough.\nEmma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma + Lung UK, said: ‘ For the 1 in 5 people living with a lung condition in the UK, flu can lead to a potentially life-threatening asthma attack or a flare up of their lung condition and worsen symptoms such as breathlessness and coughing.\n‘As well as having your flu vaccine, it’s equally important that people with lung conditions such as asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) take their medicines as prescribed.\n‘This includes using their preventer inhaler daily and always carrying their reliever inhaler with them.’",
