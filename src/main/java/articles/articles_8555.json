    "title": "Clémentine Célarié très émue : elle se confie sans filtre sur son combat contre le cancer dans Sept à Huit",
    "text": "Comme chaque dimanche, Audrey Crespo-Mara recevait dans son \"portrait de la semaine\" une personnalité dans Sept à Huit sur TF1. Ce 7 janvier 2024, il s'agissait de l'actrice [Clémentine Célarié](/people/clementine-celarie_p1262) qui s'est confiée sans détour sur son combat contre le cancer. Un sujet très intime qu'elle n'a pas hésité à évoquer pour aider les mentalités à évoluer. Ce n'était d'ailleurs pas la première fois qu'elle évoquait le sujet publiquement. En 2021, soit deux ans [après avoir été diagnostiquée d'un cancer du côlon](/article/clementine-celarie-sa-carriere-menacee-par-son-cancer-les-producteurs-ne-voudront-plus-t-engager_a461803/1), elle publiait son livre intitulé Les Mots défendus, aux éditions Albin Michel, dans lequel elle abordait sans fard sa bataille contre la maladie. En février 2023, elle confiait à nos confrères de France Bleu : \"Quand vous avez eu un cancer, vous êtes comme un incendie de forêt. Quand vous êtes guérie d'un truc comme ça, vous êtes tellement reconnaissant à la vie qu'on ne va pas perdre du temps\". Puis quelques mois plus tard, en mai 2023, elle déclarait confuse dans l'émission En Aparté : \"De toute façon, [il y a toujours une épée de Damoclès, même après 5 ans](/article/-ca-me-rattrape-clementine-celarie-guerie-mais-pas-completement-liberee-de-son-cancer-du-colon_a508209/1). Bientôt, je vais atteindre les 5 ans (...) Il y a des gens qui vous disent des conneries, même des docteurs que vous croisez en tournée. Ils vous disent 'Oui, le terrain...' Le terrain ? Le terrain quoi, le terrain cancéreux ? Ça veut dire que j'ai un 'terrain' ? Pourquoi tu me dis que j'ai un terrain ? Pourquoi me dire ça ?\". Ce dimanche 7 janvier, Clémentine Célarié était donc l'invitée du portrait de Sept à Huit et s'est de nouveau confiée avec beaucoup de sincérité sur la maladie. Audrey Crespo-Mara lui demandait : \"Et vous intimement, [comment vivez-vous ce combat contre la maladie](/article/clementine-celarie-isolee-depuis-son-cancer-du-colon-je-n-ai-pas-de-vie_a508425/1) ?\". L'actrice se lançait alors dans une réponse pleine d'émotion. \"Je suis toute seule, je suis dans mon lit, parce que là je parle de la chimio. Pour moi, le combat, c'était pendant la chimio. J'ai envie de ne pas sortir du tout. Je n'ai pas du tout envie de sortir dans le monde\", débutait-elle. Et d'ajouter : \"J'ai envie de me créer un monde\". Curieuse, l'épouse de Thierry Ardisson lui demandait alors quel monde elle souhaitait se créer. Et Clémentine Célarié, les yeux rougis, de répondre du tac au tac : \"Je pense que c'est relié à l'enfance qui est toujours en moi\". Elle précisait avec les yeux qui brillent : \"Je ne pleure pas... Je suis émue, parce que je me rends compte qu'en fait, c'est la force qu'on a de l'amour que l'on a reçu petit, qui fait qu'on a de la force quand on est malade\". Clémentine Célarié ajoutait : \"Je suis émue de parler de ça parce que l'enfance, en fait, c'est une richesse et mon enfance s'est passée en Afrique. Donc quand je parle d'enfance, ce sont mes parents et ce sont les gens qui étaient à la maison, et qui aidaient Maman...\". C'est ma bouée de sauvetage... Je me créé un monde, j'imagine que des gens sont là, je pense au public, il faut que je me batte pour eux, il faut que je remonte sur scène\", poursuivait l'actrice très émue. Et de conclure : \"J'imagine qu'ils sont là, que l'on discute et qu'ils me disent 'ne t'inquiète pas', j'imagine qu'ils me rassurent, j'imagine que le public est un ami éphémère mais profond et ça, c'est tout le merveilleux de la maturité\".",

Transcript It has been edited for clarity. Hello everyone, I’m Lama Aria Drolma, an ordained nun and a Buddhist teacher. I’m a graduate of a traditional Tibetan three-year retreat program in the Karma Kagyu lineage and I’ve completed over 13 years of Buddhist monastic study and mindfulness meditation. READ MORE I now lead mindfulness meditation retreats, workshops, and seminars worldwide on topics related to improving metacognitive awareness, emotional intelligence, mental clarity, and overall mental wellness. The topic I will discuss in this talk is Buddha’s teachings on the four noble truths and living life with purpose. To begin, we start with taking refuge and engendering bodhichitta. In the Buddha, Dharma and the supreme Sangha, I take refuge, until I reach enlightenment, by the merit of practicing the paramitas, may I attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all beings. Buddha’s teachings on the four noble truths is one of the most profound insights into the nature of life. The four noble truths are not just philosophical ideas. Rather, the Buddha taught them as scientific truths, such as laws of gravity and evolution. And to not know these truths is like sleepwalking through life and repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results. Centering Meditation Before we start, let’s center ourselves so we can pay attention to these profound teachings and be in the present moment with a brief meditation. I’ll ring the bell. Let’s start by sitting up straight but be comfortable. Focus the mind’s attention on the breath. Breathe in and breathe out at your own pace, and just pay attention to your breath going in and going out. Let’s sit for a few moments. Continue breathing. As you breathe out, rest your mind in that present moment of awareness. Inhale and exhale. As you exhale, just rest your mind in that present moment of awareness. Letting go of all your stress and being centered here and now. Relax. I’ll ring the bell now, and you can gently open your eyes. The Four Noble Truths The four noble truths are the core foundation of Buddhism, offering profound insights into the very nature of human existence. The first noble truth states that suffering is inevitable, and an inherent part of life itself. The second noble truth is that there are causes and conditions of the suffering. The third noble truth is that there is an end to the suffering. The fourth noble truth is that there is a path that liberates us from suffering. By decoding the four noble truths, we can have a roadmap to navigate life’s challenges, have freedom from suffering, and live a life of contentment. So let’s explore the four noble truths of the Buddha’s teachings and see how these ancient teachings can guide us towards a more meaningful existence and enrich our lives. The First Noble Truth The first noble truth is the truth of suffering, and suffering is referred to as dukkha in Pali, the language of the Buddhist scriptures. It states that human lives have inherent feelings of dissatisfaction, discomfort, unpleasantness, and restlessness. The suffering can manifest in physical pain, or emotional distress. From the moment we’re born, until the moment we die, we encounter suffering in many different forms, such as birth, old age, sickness, death, separation from loved ones, loss of wealth, unhappiness, and dissatisfaction due to all the changes in our lives. Due to the impermanence of life itself. A good example can be someone who has a successful business. Even with all the wealth and success, they may suffer from overwhelming stress, strained relationships due to work, work demands and constant fear of failure. So despite all outward achievements, they could be very unhappy and suffering because wealth doesn’t necessarily bring us happiness. However, Buddha’s teaching was not just to point out suffering as an inherent fact of life, he also gives us insight into the causes. The Second Noble Truth So this leads us to the second noble truth, the truth of the causes of suffering. The Buddha taught that the root cause of suffering is craving, attachment, and ignorance. The endless desire and attachment to acquiring and possessing, as well as to avoid unpleasantness, unpleasant experiences chains us to this vicious circle of endlessly seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. An example is someone constantly seeking external validation and material possessions. Their attachments and desires lead to a cycle of dissatisfaction as they continually crave for more without finding lasting fulfillment, and they suffer because of this constant craving. But in the midst of this reality, there is hope. The Third Noble Truth The third noble truth is the truth of the cessation of suffering. The Buddha taught that it is possible to overcome suffering by eliminating its causes. For example, by cultivating present moment awareness and letting go of these attachments such as craving, desire, ignorance, hatred, greed, and delusion, we can gradually find inner peace and contentment of our mental anguish and suffering. So how do we achieve the cessation of suffering? The Fourth Noble Truth This brings us to the fourth noble truth, the truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. Often called The Noble Eightfold Path. This path consists of eight interrelated principles. They are right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right lifestyle, right effort, right mindfulness, and right meditation and concentration. By cultivating qualities such as these, in our thoughts, words, and action, we can progress towards a meaningful and fulfilling existence. Living a Life of Purpose So now let’s reflect on how these profound insights into the four noble truths can guide us towards living a life of purpose. Firstly, by recognizing the truth of suffering, we can develop a greater empathy and compassion towards ourselves and others. Secondly, understanding the origin of sufferings allows us to examine our thought patterns of craving and attachment. By cultivating mindfulness and awareness, we can observe our desires without being consumed by them, leading to greater freedom in our own choices. Thirdly, by embracing the possibility of the cessation of suffering, we can cultivate hope and optimism in all life’s challenges. Finally, by committing to the noble eightfold path, we can embark on a journey of personal and spiritual growth. Each step along this path brings us closer to the realization of our full potential, and living in alignment with our deepest values and aspirations. So in conclusion, the four noble truths offer profound insight into the very nature of human existence, providing us a roadmap for living life with purpose and fulfillment. By acknowledging the reality of suffering, understanding its causes, embracing the possibility of liberation, and following the path towards awakening, we can transcend the limitations of our conditioned existence, and experience profound peace and freedom, and embark on life’s journey with courage, wisdom, and compassion. I conclude this talk with the dedication of merit. By this virtue, may I quickly attain the state of buddhahood, and then lead every being without exception to this very state. I thank you all. May you have peace and happiness in your life. Thank you.",

    "text": "Peace agreement with ULFA faction will bring lasting peace: Assam Chief Minister A peace dialogue between the central government and a faction of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) which has been on for over a decade now, has been signed this evening here in the national capital in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. [ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 18:27 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 18:27 IST - Country: - India The tripartite agreement signed between the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)'s pro-talks faction, the Centre and the Assam government will bring lasting peace in the state, asserted Chief Minister HImanta Biswa Sarma. \"This is a historic day for Assam. The process for peace has been on in Assam under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the guidance of Home Minister Amit Shah. We did accord with Bodo, Karbi, and Adivasi insurgent group,\" Sarma said here in the national capital, as the agreement was signed. \"This agreement will fulfil many of the aspirations of the people of Assam. In general, PM Modi's outreach towards Assam and other parts of the northeast has made this possible,\" Sarma added. Sarma assured that the points mentioned in the tripartite agreement will be 100 per cent implemented by the Centre and the State government. A 29-member delegation of the ULFA's pro-talks delegation, including 16 ULFA members and 13 from civil society, signed the agreement. A peace dialogue between the central government and a faction of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) which has been on for over a decade now comes to a close after the signing of today's agreement in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. The insurgent group ULFA came into being in April 1979 in the aftermath of an agitation against undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan). The illegal influx in Assam has been on, though with varying degrees, ever since India's independence. Locals in Assam feared a massive change in demography, which may pose a threat to their culture, land, and other political rights. ULFA was split into two factions in 2011 when the pro-talk faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa decided to return to Assam from \"abroad\" and participate in peace talks while the other group ULFA (Independent), led by its commander Paresh Barua, was opposed to negotiations unless the 'sovereignty' clause was discussed upon. Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction gave up violence and agreed to unconditional talks with the government. Anup Chetia, another top ULFA functionary, later joined the pro-talks group a couple of years after. In 2011, ULFA submitted a 12-point charter of demands to the government which includes constitutional and political arrangements and reforms, protection of the identity and material resources of the local indigenous population of Assam, which has since been under discussion at various levels. The Union government in April sent it a draft agreement. A series of talks with officials concerned in the Central government has taken place since the delegation arrived in Delhi before the signing of the peace pact. The Union government has signed peace deals with rebel Bodo, Dimasa, Karbi, and Adivasi outfits in Assam over the last three years. The banned ULFA-Independent led by Paresh Baruah would be the only major insurgent outfit in the state once the deal with the ULFA pro-talks faction is inked. Since Himanta Biswa Sarma became chief minister in May 2021, over 7,000 insurgents from various rebel groups have shelved their guns to join the mainstream. The state government has been running various rehabilitation programs to accommodate these former insurgents to live a respectable life. Himanta Biswa Sarma has on various occasions since becoming the chief minister appealed to ULFA(I) leader Paresh Baruah to return to the mainstream and join the massive development process that has taken place in the state. CM Sarma also emphasised the need to resolve all the outstanding issues through dialogue. Assam has witnessed decades-long insurgency, necessitating operations from the central paramilitary and Armed forces. The most prominent operations against ULFA were Operation Bajrang and Operation Rhino. The insurgency in Assam led to the loss of lives of civilians, personnel of armed forces, state police personnel, and of course the members of insurgents. Over the past decades, an estimated 10,000 have died in Assam due to insurgency, the chief minister said today. Due to the insurgency activities, the Disturbed Areas Act and Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) had to be brought in in Assam in 1980. However, now it is just limited to a few districts in Upper Assam with about 15 per cent land mass.
