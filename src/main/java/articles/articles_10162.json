    "title": "Chiang Rai's View Point Phu Chi Fa Closed Due to Border Clashes in Laos",
    "text": "CHIANG RAI – Phu Chi Fa National Park in Chiang Rai has temporarily closed its popular viewpoint after a clash near the Laos border. The fighting broke out between unidentified armed groups and Lao soldiers in Pak Tha, Bokeo, just across from Wiang Kaen district in Chiang Rai. Stray bullets crossed into Thai territory during the incident.\nOn 6 May 2025, officials from Wiang Kaen district, soldiers from the Pha Muang Task Force, and rangers stepped up security at Doi Pha Tang in Por subdistrict. The border skirmish began on 3 May and led to gunfire that damaged homes in Ban Rai Pha Mon village. One house was hit by a bullet through the roof, while another took two hits.\nThe Park Chief, Thanitpong Rattanapol, has announced the temporary closure of the Phu Chi Fa viewpoint starting from 5 May and continuing until the situation is safe.\nBefore this, Suphot Lankawiranan, the district chief of Wiang Kaen, sent an urgent notice to all subdistrict heads and village leaders along the Thai-Lao border. The letter urged them to keep residents informed and alert after gunshots and stray bullets struck local homes.\nPeople were advised to stay updated with news from officials.\nThe district has also asked everyone to avoid unnecessary activities near the border for their safety. Locals have been encouraged to report any suspicious activity or unfamiliar people in the area, either to officials or directly to the Wiang Kaen security hotline at 063-904-1427, or contact local military units at any time.\nThe recent clash took place about two kilometres from the Thai border. Reports said there was no fighting or gunfire in the border area yesterday, but Lao forces have yet to fully secure the site.\nThree people detained by Lao troops stated they belonged to an ethnic minority group that has long been involved in conflict within Laos. The reason for the attack on the Lao military post is still unclear.\nInitial reports suggest the incident may be linked to drug trafficking groups using the border route, after Lao authorities increased anti-drug operations. Another possible cause is unrest among an ethnic group that has faced discrimination in Laos, leading to organised resistance.\nPhu Chi Fa (also spelt Phu Chee Fah), meaning “mountain that points to the sky,” is a renowned mountain and national forest park in Thoeng District, Chiang Rai Province, Northern Thailand.\nLocated on the border with Laos, it is part of the Doi Pha Mon mountain range and sits at an elevation of approximately 1,628 meters above sea level. The area is famous for its breathtaking sunrise views over a “sea of mist,” offering panoramic vistas of misty valleys, the Mekong River, and the Thai-Lao border.\nPhu Chi Fa Key Highlights Scenic Beauty : Phu Chi Fa is celebrated for its 360-degree views, especially at sunrise when the mist blankets the valleys, creating a surreal, cloud-like landscape. The cliff’s unique shape and elevated position make it a prime spot for photography. Hiking : The hike to the main viewpoint is short and relatively easy, covering about 760 meters from the parking lot and taking 10–30 minutes. The trail can be steep and slippery, so proper footwear is recommended.\nBiodiversity : The forest park is home to diverse flora and fauna, including wild boars, barking deer, various reptiles, amphibians, and plant species like white orchid trees and Thai cherry blossoms (blooming December–February).\nCultural Experience : The area is near Hmong and Yao hill tribe villages, where visitors can explore local culture, traditions, and purchase handmade crafts.\nThe ideal time to visit is from November to February, during the cool, dry season when the sea of mist is most prominent, and temperatures can drop to 6–10°C at night. Mornings are chilly, so bring warm clothing. The rainy season (May–October) can obscure views with clouds and fog, and the burning season (February–April) is best avoided due to air quality issues.\nRelated News: Laos Military Base Attacked on Chiang Rai Border, Thai Military on High Alert",

    "text": "By Brittany Kriegstein ,\n7 hours ago Pigeons sit on a ledge at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Midtown on a cold day on Dec. 6, 2024. Bundle up, New Yorkers, because it's about to be unseasonably cold into the weekend, according to meteorologists.\n“ Typically, this time of the year a normal high would be somewhere around 45 degrees,” John Cristantello with the National Weather Service said on Friday. “For today, we're only going to be in the mid 30s.”\nSaturday and Sunday should warm up slightly, with Sunday’s highs in the low 40s, he said. But the real thaw-out won’t happen until the beginning of next week, when temperatures are expected to climb back into the 50s.\n“ On Monday and Tuesday, the winds are going to shift a little more from the south, and that should help push up the temperatures a bit,” Cristantello added. “So it'll actually be above normal on Monday.”\nThe skies should stay dry and mostly sunny throughout the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. The New York region is still experiencing drought conditions despite the recent rains, experts told Gothamist this week.\n2",

This update also includes redesigned icons and appearance options for CarPlay, along with widget support.\nThe upcoming iOS 26 will enable applications to display videos on CarPlay screens, a functionality restricted to instances when the vehicle is parked. This feature requires explicit enablement by individual automakers; it will not be universally active by default upon the iOS 26 release. Consequently, some manufacturers may not implement the support, or their rollouts could be significantly delayed.\nBeyond video playback, iOS 26 will implement redesigned icons and new appearance options for CarPlay. The update also incorporates support for widgets and introduces enhancements to the Music and Messages applications. These particular updates do not necessitate specific approval from car manufacturers and are expected to be available in September.\nCarPlay Ultra, a more advanced iteration of CarPlay, was initially announced in May in conjunction with Aston Martin. Future support for CarPlay Ultra is projected to extend to vehicles from Kia, Hyundai, Porsche, Genesis, Ford, Nissan, Infiniti, Jaguar, and Honda. However, several manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Polestar, Renault, and General Motors, are not expected to integrate CarPlay Ultra into their vehicles.",

    "title": "He Was Muslim but the Virgin Mary Appeared to Him and on Christmas Eve He Became a Monk",
    "text": "(ZENIT News – Porta Luz/ Madrid, 29.12.2023).- Every now and then different media offer readers testimonies of Muslims who have converted to Catholicism due to encounters – including extraordinary ones – with Saints, the Virgin Mary and Christ Himself. However, in some countries, taking the step to embrace the Catholic faith can cost them their life. Charbel, his name now as a Christian, is an example of such conversions. A Sunnite Muslim of Lebanon, he was baptized in 2017, and came to the Church through the mediation of the Virgin Mary. He has given his life to God, being part of a contemplative religious community, in a monastery close to Beirut. The Voice from Heaven During Ramadan Charbel recalls that the first extraordinary event took place during the month of Ramadan. He was walking in Beirut after morning prayers in the mosque, when he heard a voice from Heaven that pronounced words he had never heard before: “Glory to Jesus, the only Son of God, and glory to the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.” Charbel grew up in a Sunnite neighbourhood of Beirut. He didn’t know any Christian with whom he could share that impressive experience, he said in an interview published in the National Catholic Register: “This was impactful for me.” “Do Not Be Afraid” Then, on Christmas Eve of that year and while he was studying at home, he had a vision. “I saw the Virgin Mary for the first time in front of me and She said to me: “Do not be afraid, go on seeking, I am with you.” All I can say is that it was the most beautiful thing that I have seen in my life. From the moment I saw Her, I felt peace in my heart. I felt as if I were at home,” added Charbel. After these events, he tried to meet Christians through the social networks, but between fear and mistrust, in the end he had no success. However, this was not the last time he saw the Virgin Mary. It happened again on Christmas Eve over the next three years. “She always said to me the exact same words,” he noted. Charbel’s Conversion and Baptism It was then, after the last vision, that Charbel tried to establish a link with a Christian. And he found a Catholic where he least expected to, at a party. He told that Catholic about his visions of the Virgin, his anxieties, and that he wanted to learn more about the Christian faith. His new friend introduced him to a priest, who gave him a Bible and gave him ‘John Paul’ as a contact, a Christian who had converted from Islam and who has accompanied numerous Muslims of Beirut in their path to Catholicism. After meeting with John Paul, Charbel joined a catechesis and formation group and was finally baptized in 2017, on the Feast of the Holy Cross, eight months after initiating his catechumenate. He chose the name Charbel in honour of the well-known and much loved Lebanese Saint Charbel. “The day I was baptized I cried like a baby the whole day: they were tears of joy, of knowing myself loved,” he said. From that moment up to today, Charbel has been godfather to two Muslims who followed in his steps and converted to Catholicism. His bond with Christ and the Church, his love of God are so strong that, six months after being baptized, he decided to enter a monastery of contemplative life near Beirut. “Some of us have to choose: I took the decision to jump ship to eternal and holy love. Now my reason for living is to be with the person I love, Jesus,” he confided.",

    "title": "¿A tu mascota se le cae los dientes? Conoce las posibles causas",
    "text": "La pérdida de dientes en perros y gatos puede ser un problema preocupante para los dueños de mascotas. Existen diversas causas, desde el envejecimiento hasta factores como las peleas o enfermedades específicas. Conocer las razones detrás de este fenómeno es clave para prevenir y tratar estos problemas a tiempo.\nLas mascotas, al igual que los seres humanos, tienen una salud dental que requiere atención y cuidado. Sin embargo, hay situaciones en las que notamos que sus dientes comienzan a deteriorarse o caerse de manera inesperada. Aunque es un tema que muchos dueños de mascotas pasan por alto, la pérdida de dientes puede ser una señal de algo más profundo. ¿Cuáles son las razones que podrían estar detrás de este problema?\nLa doctora Ana Paola Vera, médica veterinaria de Groom Room, explicó en RPP que la causa más común de la pérdida de dientes en perros es el envejecimiento. Con el paso de los años, los perros van experimentando un desgaste natural de las encías y una progresiva pérdida de calcio, lo que puede llevar a la caída de sus dientes. Según la doctora Vera, este proceso suele comenzar entre los 8 y 9 años de edad, cuando los perros ya son considerados mayores.\nOtra causa común de la pérdida de dientes en perros es la predisposición genética de ciertas razas. Un ejemplo claro es el yorkshire, que, debido a su particular forma dental, tiene una mayor tendencia a acumular sarro en sus dientes. Esto hace que, en cada limpieza, sea frecuente que se le caigan un par de dientes. Para evitar este problema, es fundamental mantener una rutina de higiene dental constante, realizando profilaxis al menos de una a dos veces al año.\nOtra razón de la pérdida de dientes se encuentra en los cachorros que no han recibido suficiente amamantamiento. En casos donde son destetados demasiado pronto, como cuando se les separa de la madre a la semana de nacidos, o cuando nunca han amamantado, pueden presentar un déficit de calcio. Esta falta de nutrientes esenciales puede afectar el desarrollo adecuado de sus dientes, aumentando el riesgo de pérdida dental prematura.\nEl sarro es otra de las causas de la caída de dientes. La acumulación de sarro en los dientes provoca irritación en las encías, lo que puede generar molestias y picazón en los dientes. Si no se trata a tiempo, esta condición puede llevar a la pérdida de piezas dentales o incluso a la necesidad de una extracción dental obligatoria para evitar complicaciones mayores en la salud bucal del animal.\nDe acuerdo con la especialista, es fundamental que los perros pasen por una revisión dental al menos dos veces al año. A partir de los 3 años de edad, estas revisiones son obligatorias, mientras que antes de esa edad no son tan esenciales. La doctora recomienda que los dueños empiecen a acostumbrar a sus mascotas desde cachorros a que les revisen la boca, para que el perro se familiarice con el proceso. Además, es importante acostumbrarlos al lavado de dientes desde pequeños, lo que contribuirá a mantener su salud bucal y prevenir problemas a futuro.\n¿Qué podemos darle de comer a un perro de avanzada edad que empieza a perder sus dientes? Si la mascota está acostumbrada a las croquetas, una opción es mojarlas con agua caliente y luego machacarlas con un tenedor hasta obtener una textura similar a un puré. Esta adaptación facilita la alimentación, evitando que el perro tenga dificultades al masticar. Además, actualmente existen dietas especiales en forma de comida licuada, diseñadas para perros sin dientes, ya sea por una extracción o por la caída natural de sus piezas dentales, lo que les permite continuar con una nutrición adecuada.\nEn el caso de los gatos, la causa principal de la pérdida de dientes no es tanto la edad, sino la gingivitis. Una enfermedad común en los felinos es la gingivitis idiopática, que está estrechamente relacionada con condiciones como la leucemia y el sida felino. En estos casos, el cuerpo del gato reacciona como si el diente fuera un cuerpo extraño, lo que a menudo lleva a la extracción dental como única solución. Según la especialista, no hay mucho que se pueda hacer una vez que la enfermedad avanza, salvo prevenirla a través de la vacunación y mantener una rutina de limpieza regular de los dientes y encías del gato.\nLa segunda causa común de la pérdida de dientes en los gatos son las peleas, especialmente cuando salen al exterior. Los gatos que se aventuran fuera de casa corren el riesgo de pelear con otros animales, lo que puede resultar en heridas orales que dañan sus dientes. Por esta razón, es recomendable mantener a los gatos dentro de casa siempre que sea posible, para reducir el riesgo de lesiones y proteger su salud dental.\n¿Qué podemos darle de comer a un gato que comienza a perder sus dientes? En estos casos, lo más recomendable es ofrecerle paté, ya que es un alimento que no requiere masticar, lo que facilita la alimentación. Sin embargo, dado que los gatos son animales con preferencias muy específicas, se sugiere acostumbrarlos a comer paté incluso antes de que se produzca la extracción dental, para que el cambio en su dieta no resulte tan brusco y puedan adaptarse mejor a la nueva forma de alimentarse.\nComparte esta noticia",

    "title": "La fascista Línea de Defensa Inglesa legitima el genocidio de Gaza",
    "text": "La fascista Línea de Defensa Inglesa, protagonista de los últimos disturbios antimusulmanes en el Reino Unido, es desde el atentado de Hamás contra Israel del pasado 7 de octubre el principal legitimador del genocidio de Gaza. «Es como si volviéramos a los días más oscuros que siguieron a los ataques terroristas del 11 de septiembre en EEUU», señala la periodista británica Shaista Aziz al diario alemán Junge Welt. Aziz se dio de baja en el Partido Laborista después de que su líder y hoy primer ministro, Keir Starmer, pareciese condonar el castigo colectivo infligido por Israel a los gazatíes. «Los musulmanes británicos que reclaman que se ponga fin a esa masacre son tachados de «predicadores de odio» por la clase política y los medios nacionales», denuncia Aziz. La Liga de Defensa Inglesa la fundó en Luton en 2009 el ultraderechista Stephen Christopher Lennon, más conocido por el pseudónimo de Tommy Robinson, después de que un grupo de manifestantes llamaran «carniceros de Basora» a los integrantes de un batallón británico que volvía de la guerra ilegal de Irak. Matones de extrema derecha se dedicaron entonces a atacar y saquear comercios de la comunidad musulmana local, algo parecido a lo que ocurre también estos días en el Reino Unido. Según un análisis del blog político British Politics and Policy, la Liga (ADL, por sus siglas en inglés) reclama la firme defensa de la identidad británica frente a la que califica de «violencia islamista». De acuerdo con la periodista alemana Susann Witt-Stahl, especialista en movimientos de ultraderecha europeos, entre ellos el ucraniano, la ADL mantiene estrechas relaciones con los iraníes del exilio que combaten al régimen de Teherán. Tommy Robinson llama a la rebelión del pueblo iraní contra los ayatolás y afirma que allí existe una situación inversa a la de Gaza, «donde la población (palestina) apoya a un régimen de terror». Los llamamientos de índole fascista del fundador de la Liga y sobre todo un vídeo de denuncia de la llamada «cultura de la cancelación» han servido a aquél para recaudar donaciones de millonarios islamófobos. Entre quienes le apoyan figura, según Witt-Stahl, el ex director general de la empresa minorista Overstock.com y promotor del bitcoin Patrick Byrne, quien ha hecho también campaña a favor del movimiento conspiracionista de extrema derecha Qanon y redes similares. El multimillonario del sector tecnológico Robert Shillman, fundador de Cognex Corporation, que ocupa puestos directivos en varias organizaciones sionistas de EEUU como la de Amigos de las Fuerzas de Defensa Israelíes, financió también durante algún tiempo a Tommy Robinson. Éste ha recibido asimismo dinero para su defensa legal –tiene un amplio historial delictivo– del derechista Foro de Oriente Medio fundado por el conocido historiador y reputado islamófobo Daniel Pipes. Los artículos que Robinson escribe como periodista son difundidos por el Instituto Gatestone, fundado por el halcón estadounidense John Bolton, ex asesor de Trump, quien incluso decidió despedirle por considerar demasiado extremos sus consejos belicistas en relación con Afganistán, Irak, Corea del Norte o Irán.",

Ensenada, BC.- La Asociación Civil Ciudadanía Mexicana, que junto a un grupo de ciudadanos han pugnado durante años para que Ensenada cuente con playas libres de contaminación, consideró que 2023 fue un año en el que la problemática tocó fondo. “El problema sigue y el próximo año vamos a seguir trabajando principalmente para lograr la transparencia en la inversión pública, seguir trabajando para lograr que las plantas de tratamiento funcionen bien, vigilancia interna a la Cespe, como ciudadanía creemos que hemos cometido un gran error al dejar que esta institución se torne opaca y esto ha derivado en esta problemática social y ambiental que pone en riesgo nuestra economía”, declaró Gabriel Camacho Jiménez, representante legal de la asociación.

Contaminación peligrosa para diversas especies Además de la afectación a la ciudadanía y la economía de Ensenada, mencionó que el problema de contaminación también ha sido trágico para diversas especies. “Tenemos información cualitativa, nos refieren aves y mamíferos muertos en un mayor porcentaje de incidencia, sin embargo, es necesario hacer estudios como podrían ser autopsias a los organismos para determinar las causas de estas muertes y aseverar con datos la relación entre las descargas de aguas negras y esta mortandad de especies silvestres, visualmente el impacto es grande si vamos a los sitios vemos especies protegidas entre las aguas negras”, reveló.",
