    "text": "Este viernes 2 de agosto, a las alertas de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) por altas temperaturas se sumarán otras de aviso por tormentas. Aunque con algo menos de intensidad que los últimos días, el calor prosigue y los termómetros van a seguir marcando cifras elevadas. Además, durante esta jornada en muchas provincias se producirán fuertes rachas de viento con precipitaciones e incluso, granizo. Las alertas decretadas para este viernes se concentran en el sur y en el este de España. En el caso de Cataluña, a partir del mediodía habrá riesgo importante por tormentas en el Prepirineo de Barcelona, en el Pirineo de Girona y en la Depresión central de Barcelona. Las lluvias estarán presentes en toda la región, a excepción de la zona de Ampurdán (Girona), en la que se combinan los avisos costeros con los de temperaturas elevadas. Estos últimos también se han establecido en Lleida. En la Comunidad Valenciana, las tormentas, el probable granizo y las intensas rachas de viento se concentrarán en Castellón y también se extenderán hacia Teruel. Quedan las áreas de interior de la región marcadas por las temperaturas elevadas, que podrán llegar a los 39 grados. Los termómetros asimismo marcarán estas cifras en Albacete y en Murcia. En Baleares hay alerta por \\\"rissagas\\\" en Menorca y por calor importante en el interior de Mallorca, donde se producirán máximas de 37 grados. También habrá avisos costeros en el sur y en el oeste de las islas Canarias. Los puntos más calurosos del país este viernes se encontrarán en los siguientes territorios andaluces, donde habrá 40 grados durante la tarde: Valle del Almanzora y Los Vélez (Almería), Sol y Guadalhorce (Málaga), Axarquía (Málaga), Nacimiento y Campo de Tabernas (Almería), Campiña cordobesa (Córdoba), Litoral de Huelva (Huelva), Morena y Condado (Jaén), Valle del Guadalquivir de Jaén (Jaén) y Campiña sevillana (Sevilla). Las autoridades sanitarias y los expertos en meteorología recomiendan adoptar medidas contra el calor como beber agua con frecuencia para mantenerse hidratados y vestirse con prendas frescas que permitan la transpiración. Además, se debe evitar la exposición directa al sol. También hay que cuidar la piel aplicando a menudo sobre ella crema solar de alto factor de protección.",

    "text": "Interested in getting The Pine Bluff Commercial's Newsletter delivered to your inbox every morning?\nIn a powerful testament to redemption and the enduring human spirit, the Rev. Charles Banks, once entrenched in the perilous world of gang life in southeast Arkansas, has emerged as a beacon of hope, now serving as a devoted church pastor. His journey, marked by hardship and profound transformation, offers a compelling narrative of how faith and determination can pave the way for a new purpose.\nBanks, an original-gangster Crip member in the 1990s, who transformed his life to become a church pastor, shared his powerful testimony Tuesday at the Trinity Community Learning Center's summer camp. The event, organized by program coordinator Jackie Brimsley, aimed to provide young people with a compelling message of hope and redemption.\nBrimsley, a long-time friend of Banks, felt a strong calling to invite him to speak. \"The Lord put him on my heart to call and ask him all the way in Louisiana to come and speak to the young people here, because I knew he had a word for them,\" she explained.\nBanks shared his raw and unfiltered experiences, painting a vivid picture of the destructive path he once trod. He spoke candidly about the allure of gang life, the false sense of toughness, and the brutal realities that ultimately lead to imprisonment, injury, and even death. His profound words echoed, detailing the clear division between a life of aggression and one committed to learning and constructive transformation.\n\"You want to go somewhere in life and be something, pick up something productive,\" Banks implored, emphasizing the importance of choosing a path far removed from the streets. He reflected on the regret of past choices. \"If I can do it again, I wish I could do it all over,\" said Banks.\nBanks has shared his story he titled \"From Crip to Christ,\" of what he describes as being a former gangster, drug dealer and drug user, which led him to prison. He was also featured in the 1994 HBO documentary \"Gang War: Bangin' in Little Rock.\"\nBanks said it is precisely these past experiences that now fuel his mission to guide others away from similar pitfalls.\nBanks is now a member of Faith, a peaceful gang.\n\"God has changed me and set me free from the drugs,\" said Banks.\nA poignant moment in his discourse involved a visual demonstration using a body bag, starkly illustrating the ultimate consequence of gang involvement. \"This is a body bag when they put dead folks in,\" he explained, driving home the message that a life of crime often ends in tragedy and a loss of freedom.\nHe also shared personal scars, revealing a \"scar on my leg\" and explaining he had been shot and stabbed, tangible reminders of the violence he endured.\nBanks stressed the importance of education, urging the children to \"go get your education\" and \"don't do drugs, don't join gangs.\"\n\"If you fall, get back up and keep on running. Don't let nobody tell you that you can't get this,\" he said.\nNow a pastor with 12 children and a program in Louisiana called \"Road to Success,\" Banks embodies the very transformation he preaches. He speaks with the authority of someone who has lived through the darkness and emerged into the light, using his own life as a powerful example. Banks now devotes his time to his family, his church, and his community with a desire to see \"every last one of y'all be successful.\"\nBrimsley spoke on how Banks' story is a powerful reminder that change is possible, no matter how daunting the past may seem. She explained how Banks' story resonates deeply with the challenges many young people face today, including the pressures of drugs, alcohol and negative peer influences.\n\"Children now have a whole lot of things to deal with, like drugs, alcohol, and wrong friends. All of that,\" she said. \"Charles has been through all that ... he can tell them how they would make a mistake by going the route he went, and he can show them how he went from gang member ... to pastor in a church. And that's amazing. That's a really amazing story.\"",

And it would not be a sin for those who do,” Ndayishimiye said in response to a question at a public event in the east of the country that was broadcast by Burundian media.\\nHe also criticised Western countries that urge smaller nations to allow gay marriage or risk losing aid, saying: “Let them keep their help, let them keep it.”\\nBurundians living abroad who have “chosen the devil” and practise homosexuality should “not come back”, he added.\\n\\nHomosexuality is illegal in many East African countries, which have a history of repression and stigmas against gay people, often encouraged by conservative Muslims and Christians.\\nUganda in May adopted what has been described as one of the world’s harshest laws against homosexuality, prompting outrage among rights groups and Western powers.\\nIn response, Washington has said it would remove Uganda from a key trade deal and has imposed visa restrictions on some officials, while the World Bank suspended new loans to the country.\\nThe legislation is currently being challenged at Uganda’s constitutional court.\\n\\n\\nIn March this year, Burundi charged 24 people with “homosexual practices” in a crackdown on same-sex relationships.\\nThe move followed a call by Ndayishimiye for citizens to root out homosexuality and treat gay people as “pariahs”.\\nNdayishimiye took power in June 2020 after the death of president Pierre Nkurunziza and has been lauded by the international community for slowly ending years of Burundi’s isolation under his predecessor’s chaotic and bloody rule.\\nBut he has failed to improve a wretched human rights record, and the country of 12 million people remains one of the poorest on the planet.\\n",

    "text": "MSFS 2024 Devs Are Working Around The Clock, but It's Still Not Enough. Server Problems Continue to Give Players Hard Time\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 looks beautiful - when it doesn't have the server problems that continue to plague the Asobo studio's game 3 days after its release.\nUpdate (November 22, 1:36 a.m.)\nAnother day, [another announcement from the devs of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024](https://x.com/MSFSofficial/status/1859692521707671589). Unfortunately, once again it cannot be considered positive:\nWe continue to see access and bandwidth issues as more users come online globally. We're actively working on increased capacity fixes. We want to express our gratitude to the community and apologize for this frustrating experience. We'll share ongoing updates across our channels, wrote Jorg Neumann, head of the team responsible for MSFS 2024.\nMeanwhile, [fewer and fewer people are playing](https://steamdb.info/app/2537590/charts/) on Steam, although the game's reception is improving slightly - [currently 29% of player reviews are positive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/).\nOriginal news (November 21, 00:29 a.m.)\nThe release of the \"most complex flight simulator in history\" hasn't yet proven to be a historic success for the Asobo studio series. After allegedly dealing with the launch problems, the developers of [Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024](https://www.gamepressure.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/z166b3) reported further problems with accessing the game. They already increased server performance but [admitted that this isn't how the release of the new MSFS should look like](https://x.com/MSFSofficial/status/1859397025508262094).\nNot all players are experiencing problems and - interestingly - it doesn't seem to be related to the bandwidth of their internet connections (at least judging by the comments on social media). Nevertheless, the disappointment with MSFS 2024 is widespread. Just take a look at the reviews on Steam – [currently, only 24% of user reviews are positive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/).\nThere is also no need to look far for the reasons for players' irritation. Fans had concerns from the beginning about the decision to use data streaming, but the technical alpha from last month didn't foreshadow the problems.\nThere is one main complaint: problems with accessing the game and loading objects. Due to server problems, starting the game can be difficult, and during gameplay, the title sometimes fails to load high-quality textures and [models](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvwai1/hmmm_expectation_vs_reality/), [including planes](https://x.com/Jackaluk1/status/1859411282975481872). As a result, a game that was supposed to take MSFS's visuals to the next level ends up looking too often like [a title from almost 30 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvtykp/msfs_2024_after_24_hours). Or, [as malicious internet users claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvt04e/my_contribution_to_this_absurd_situation/), [Minecraft](https://www.gamepressure.com/games/minecraft/zd652) ([and this isn't just a joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvkhry/msfs_2024_is_awesome/)).\nNot all players encounter such issues, and when Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 works as it should, it can truly impress with its visuals. However, excessively long loading times for the game (reportedly exceeding 6 hours according to internet users), glitches, and crashes are ruining the enjoyment for fans of the latest flight simulator, even 2 days after its release.\nThese access and gameplay issues are likely the reason why the number of people playing MSFS 2024 on Steam [is decreasing](https://steamdb.info/app/2537590/charts/). Of course, data from just 2 days should be viewed critically, especially due to gameplay issues and the fact that the title is also available on Game Pass. However, at this moment, a clear downward trend is visible.",
