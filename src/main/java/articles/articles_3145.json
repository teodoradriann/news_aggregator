    "text": "Cincinnati Zoo Fellows: The Next Generation of Wildlife Conservationists\nProspère TEBERD\nMeet Prospère TEBERD, a wildlife conservationist with a deep passion for studying primate behavior and preserving their habitats. Originally from Congo, Prospere currently works closely with gorillas while pursuing his masters in the U.S. When he’s not working in the field, you might catch him playing volleyball, strumming his guitar, or exploring new cultural perspectives on conservation. His long-term goal is to lead large-scale projects that balance protecting wildlife with improving local livelihoods across Africa.\nAs a Cincinnati Zoo Fellow, Prospère’s project focuses on promoting gorilla conservation through sustainable ecotourism and community engagement in northern Congo. By creating initiatives like revenue-sharing from ecotourism, environmental education, and job creation, he hopes to reduce human-wildlife conflict and foster long-term conservation efforts. For Prospere, coexistence means creating an environment where humans and wildlife thrive together, with solutions that benefit both. 🌍🦍\n#GorillaConservation #ConservationImpact #CZBGFellow\nMarisa Phringphroh (“Kie”)\nMarisa Phringphroh, or Kie as she’s known to friends, is a passionate field researcher from Thailand with a love for the great outdoors! Whether she’s trekking through the forest, camping under the stars, or birdwatching on the weekends, Kie is always seeking new ways to connect with nature. When she’s not outdoors, you can find her gardening or reading at home. Her work as a researcher with Bring The Elephant Home Foundation focuses on reducing elephant-caused crop damage through sustainable agriculture practices.\nKie’s Fellowship project is all about finding solutions for human-elephant coexistence. By exploring alternative crops that reduce crop damage, Kie hopes to create a future where both elephants and humans can thrive along the borders of national parks. For Kie, coexistence is about ensuring that both species benefit from shared spaces, creating safe zones where they can live, eat, and thrive together. 🐘🌾\n#ElephantConservation #CoexistenceInAction #CZBGFellow\nNatsuda Sutthiboriban (“Mo”)\nSay hello to Natsuda Sutthiboriban, also known as Mo! She’s an outdoor enthusiast who loves biking, running, and spending time with her pets. She steers clear of anything made with durian! Mo’s goal is to find ways for wildlife and people to coexist happily and safely, ensuring that both sides feel comfortable and secure. Through her research, she’s working to better understand how villagers living near forests can coexist peacefully with the elephants that roam nearby.\nMo’s Fellowship project focuses on studying elephant populations and their distribution in and around protected areas. By understanding where elephants are present and how they interact with local communities, she hopes to help foster positive relationships between humans and wildlife. For Mo, coexistence means more than just sharing space—it’s about creating an environment where both people and animals can live in harmony. 🐘🌿\n#ElephantResearch #HumanWildlifeCoexistence #CZBGFellow\nMariana Catapani\nFor Mariana Catapani, life is all about creating meaningful connections—both with the natural world and the people around her. In her free time, she enjoys escaping to her cabin in the forest, spending time with her three dogs, and getting lost in a good book. Mari is passionate about conservation and is driven by a desire to find inclusive and just solutions that foster a harmonious relationship between people and biodiversity.\nAs a Cincinnati Zoo Fellow, Mari works with the Wild Animal Conservation Institute (ICAS) in Brazil. Her project spans multiple areas, from reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions to creating a certified honey production initiative that supports over 100 beekeepers. She’s also leading efforts to improve domestic dog-wildlife interactions, address wildlife conflicts in urban areas, and collaborate on Pantanal wildfire policy. For Mari, coexistence means respecting both human and wildlife needs and finding sustainable ways for both to thrive. 🐾🌍\n#ConservationImpact #HumanWildlifeCoexistence #CZBGFellow\nKai Davis\nKai Davis is an outdoor enthusiast and sports lover with a passion for conservation! When he’s not on the basketball court or enjoying a good board game, Kai is working on projects that aim to benefit both wildlife and the environment. His goal is to find harmony between people, wildlife, and nature through science and conservation. For Kai, coexistence is more than just an ideal—it’s something we can strive toward by finding innovative solutions that benefit everyone involved.\nKai’s Fellowship project is focused on assessing the impact of restored habitats at Bowyer Farm on avian species. By studying which bird species are present, where they are found, and how they use the restored spaces, Kai’s research will help guide future restoration efforts. He’s also collaborating with the Cincinnati Parks Department to explore similar assessments in urban settings. His work is laying the foundation for understanding the impact of habitat restoration on wildlife and creating a brighter future for species across the region. 🐦🌿\n#HabitatRestoration #AvianConservation #CZBGFellow",

    "text": "Sozial-Doku-Serien wie „Hartz und Herzlich“ oder „Armes Deutschland“ des Senders RTL2 ziehen Millionen von Fernsehzuschauer in ihren Bann. Fernsehteams begleiten den Alltag von Sozialhilfe- und Bürgergeld-Empfängern und zeigen ihre zwischenmenschlichen und finanziellen Herausforderungen auf.\nAuch Protagonistin Carmen muss sich ihre Finanzen bedacht einteilen. Doch zu den ohnehin schon belastenden Alltagssorgen kommt jetzt auch noch ein Problem der etwas anderen Art hinzu. Denn die sechsfache Mutter hat zu allem Übel auch noch mit einer Mäuseplage zu tun.\nBürgergeld-Empfängerin am Rande der Verzweiflung\nDie Wohnung von Carmen und ihrem Nachwuchs ist ohnehin nicht sonderlich groß. Doch zu allem Übel macht dem „Hartz und Herzlich“-Star seit Kurzem eine Mäuseplage zu schaffen. Schon acht Nagetiere hat die Bürgergeld-Empfängerin gefangen, mindestens zwei laufen nach wie vor in ihren vier Wänden umher.\nCarmen berichtet frustriert: „Wir haben den Kammerjäger da gehabt, aber jetzt sind die alle abgezogen.“ Die Nagetieren treiben dennoch weiter ihr Unwesen. Deshalb kümmert sich die sechsfahre Mutter nun selber um das Problem. Die 52-Jährige hat Mäusefallen bestellt. Einige der kleinen Gerätschaften hat sie bereits in der Wohnung aufgestellt, nun sollen weitere Fallen dazu kommen.\n+++ Bürgergeld-Empfänger protzt im TV: Dummerweise schaut auch die Polizei zu +++\nMit Nutella beschmiert, sollen die Apparaturen für ein Ende des Mäuse-Terrors sorgen. Die Kammerjäger haben der Bürgergeld-Empfängerin dazu geraten, alle Vorräte wie Mehl und Zucker zu entsorgen und lediglich verschlossene Dosen aufzuheben. Doch die Bilder aus Carmens Wohnung verraten: Umgesetzt hat der RTL2-Star diese Empfehlung bisher keineswegs.\nAuf den Regalen stapeln sich Toast-Packungen, Mehl und offene Backwaren. Doch Carmen gibt zu bedenken: „Die haben dann eine Mitteilung gemacht, wir hätten zu viele Lebensmittel. Musst du dir mal vorstellen! Ja mein Gott, wir sind sieben Personen. Soll ich jetzt nur noch eine Scheibe Brot für sieben Personen hinlegen?“ Für ihre Großfamilie scheint die Protagonistin die großen Mengen an Lebensmittel zu brauchen.\nOb die Mäusefallen den gewünschten Effekt haben werden, bleibt abzuwarten. Die Bürgergeld-Empfängerin gibt sich vorerst nicht geschlagen.",

    "text": "A rare December flood warning has been issued for the Red River of the North in North Dakota.\nThe Red River of the North flows on the border of Wahpeton, in North Dakota, and Breckenridge, in Minnesota.\nThe National Weather Service has issued the rare flood warning following high amounts of ice and rain in North Dakota throughout the month of December. This is the first time a flood warning has ever been issued for the river at this time of year, according to one of the agency's meteorologists.\nStock photo shows a car driving through a flooded road. A rare December flood warning has been issued for the Red River of the North. Ajax9/Getty \"We believe this is the first,\" Carl Jones, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service based in Grand Forks, told Pioneer Press . \"It's very unusual in the heart of winter.\"\nFlood warnings in the spring and summer months are not uncommon. This is because the river is fed by snowmelt, which typically happens as the weather warms. Rain storms are also more common at that time of year.\nOver the past few days, the Red River Basin in the south has seen 1 to 2.5 inches of rainfall. Over the past week, 3 inches of rain fell, Pioneer Press reported.\nJohn Wheeler, chief meteorologist at WDAY-TV, told the news outlet that this amount of rain in December is \"unprecedented in the record book.\"\nRead more Could Lake Mead end up drying out like the ill-fated Aral Sea? NOAA maps reveal how El Niño will impact US rain and snow this winter How Lake Mead Water Levels Changed in a Year The flooding is to particularly affect low-lying areas in Elm Street in North Fargo, and Wahpeton. The flooding should only be minor. Residents can expect water to remain in ditches for some time, ValleyNewsLive reported.\nSo far, the river in Fargo is expected to increase to 21.1 feet. The river in Wahpeton has already risen to about 11 feet. The flood warning is in effect from Friday morning to Wednesday, January 3.\nThe Red River of the North flows for about 550 miles. It flows all the way to Lake Winnipeg in Canada. Not to be confused with the Red River of the South, which flows through the southern Great Plains. The river is so named due to its reddish-brown, silt-filled waters.\nNorth Dakota has been seeing some unusual weather this December. Some areas have seen its first ice storm warning in seven years, local outlet KFYR TV reported. An ice storm over the Christmas period saw thousands without power. The storm also caused disruption to the state's roads, including the Interstate 29 which closed between Fargo and Grand Forks.\nIt is normal for rivers to change with seasonal fluctuations, but climate change appears to have affected rivers across the U.S. Not only are some rivers flooding at unusual times, but some are drying up altogether due to drought. The Colorado River's flows, for example, are the lowest they have been in a century, due to extremely dry conditions.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

    "text": "Veronica Ferres in der Kritik: Jetzt reagiert die Schauspielerin\nIhre Botschaften zu Wertschätzung und Feminismus gingen nach hinten los – jetzt steht Veronica Ferres massiv in der Kritik. Ihre Reaktion spaltet die Meinungen.\nMünchen – Die Schauspielerin Veronica Ferres (60) sieht sich mit ungewöhnlichen Vorwürfen konfrontiert. Eine bekannte Autorin beschuldigt sie im Netz, Content-Klau begangen zu haben. Jetzt meldet sich die „Das Superweib“-Darstellerin zu Wort und zeigt Reue.\nAutorin Tara-Louise Wittwer erhebt schwere Vorwürfe gegen Veronica Ferres\nAm 12. Juli veröffentlichte Veronica Ferres ein Instagram-Video, das ein wichtiges gesellschaftliches Thema behandelt. Darin sprach sie über ungleiche Anforderungen an Männer und Frauen mit dem prägnanten Satz: „Ein guter Mann ist immer noch eine durchschnittliche Frau.“ Was als feministisches Statement gedacht war, wurde ihr jedoch schnell zum Verhängnis. Tara-Louise Wittwer (34), bekannt als „Spiegel“-Kolumnistin und spezialisiert auf feministische Themen, erkannte in Ferres‘ Video Ähnlichkeiten zu ihrem eigenen Content.\nBereits Ende Juni hatte Wittwer ein nahezu identisches Video veröffentlicht. Ihre Reaktion ließ nicht lange auf sich warten: „Äh? Könntest du bitte nicht mein Video klauen?“, kommentierte sie direkt unter Ferres‘ Post. „Das macht man einfach nicht, dass man performativ Videos klaut“, so die Kolumnistin in einem weiteren Beitrag auf ihrem Profil. Die Kritik blieb nicht unbemerkt. „Das Video wäre cool, wenn Tara-Louise tatsächlich auch ihre Credits bekommt“, schrieb auch eine Nutzerin stellvertretend für viele enttäuschte Follower.\nVeronica Ferres räumt Fehler ein\nKurz darauf reagierte Veronica Ferres schließlich auf die Vorwürfe. In ihrer Instagram-Story verwies sie plötzlich auf Tara-Louise Wittwer: „Auch gesehen bei der großartigen Tara-Louise.” Wenige Stunden später folgte eine weitere ausführliche Entschuldigung der Schauspielerin. „Hier ist ein Fehler passiert, für den ich die Verantwortung trage. Deinen Ärger, liebe Tara-Louise Wittwer, verstehe ich und du hast recht, das zu benennen“, erklärte die 60-Jährige in einem Statement. Sie gab zu, lediglich das ursprüngliche TikTok-Video der Influencerin Jessie Song als Quelle genannt und dabei Wittwers „klare Worte“ übernommen zu haben.\nKonsequenterweise löschte Veronica Ferres ihr umstrittenes Video. „Den Credit an dich habe ich nun nachgeholt, aber natürlich viel zu spät. Deswegen habe ich entschieden, das Video zu löschen“, betonte sie. Abschließend würdigte sie die Arbeit der Autorin: „Liebe Tara, bitte entschuldige! Dein Content ist stark, wichtig und inspiriert Frauen, laut zu werden. Bitte mach weiter so.“\nApropos: Veronica Ferres spricht über mögliche Filmprojekte mit ihrer Tochter. Doch die Pläne scheinen komplizierter als gedacht zu sein. Verwendete Quellen: Instagram/veronicaferres, Instagram/wastarasagt",

    "title": "'The Netherlands Full of Jesus': Dutch Pentecost Conference Sees 63K Participants Glorify God",
    "text": "The month of May brought some amazing examples of the power of God on display around the world from multiple massive baptisms in California, Florida, and Texas to a huge march for Jesus in Paris, France. But there's one example we missed, until now – a stunningly huge gathering for Christ in the Netherlands.\nMissiologists have long considered Europe to be post-Christian, and the Netherlands is seen as a major example of that as the Dutch country has embraced atheism, legalized drugs, and publicly glorified prostitution.\nBut roughly 60,000 Christians, a stunning number for any European country, showed up less than two weeks ago in the Netherlands to publicly praise the name of Jesus at the 54th annual Opwekking Pentecost Conference on the grounds of Walibi Holland.\nThe faith-based organization shares its mission over the last 60 years has been to follow \"Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit,\" and the conference held over Pentecost Sunday weekend had 63,000 people unashamedly glorifying God and an additional 700,000 participating online, according to the\nOpwekking Foundation.\n\"Revival means following Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit. This is our desire: The Netherlands full of Jesus,\" the organization wrote on Instagram.\nGospel artist Travis Greene led worship at the four-day conference and Pastor Pete Greig, founder of THE 24-7 Prayer Movement, was one of several speakers to share an uplifting message with attendees.\nAccording to the Netherlands Institute for Social Research, more than half of the Dutch identify as atheist or agnostic. A 2018 survey reveals that 69% of the population have never attended a church service and 29% of people considered themselves atheists.\n\"From the mid-1960s until today, this religious and political structure of the Netherlands has slowly dissolved and society has become more secular. Consequently, the percentage of people who proclaim to be active believers has decreased by two-thirds,\" wrote Benjamin Roberts for\nThe Holland Times.\nIn a 2021 survey, the\nCentral Bureau for Statistics (CBS), the official source for the country's government stats, reported that 57 percent of the population aged 15 or older in the Netherlands declared no religious affiliation.\nThe Netherlands is one of the very few countries in the world whose majority is mostly irreligious, meaning atheism, agnosticism, and other forms of irreligion.\n\"Currently, only a small minority of the population (between 14% to 28%) still believe that God is personally concerned with each individual's wellbeing, that the Bible is the Word of God, and that there is life after death,\" Roberts writes. \"People nowadays no longer look for the answers to the meaning of life in organized religions such as Christianity...Instead, they seek to find meaning in life from within.\"\nThese statistics are something Opwekking General Director Ruben Flach has been working to change for the last ten years.\nIn his farewell message at the Opwekking, he encouraged attendees to embrace the conference's theme of \"Closer\" by passionately pursuing God.\n\"The effect of the coming of the Holy Spirit is more powerful than miracles and signs: it causes people to go into the world to bring the gospel,\" he shared.\n\"We read in the Bible that God draws near to those who draw near to Him,\" he shared. \"People who respond to His invitation to come closer...It makes us grateful for what God is doing in the Netherlands and also digitally to so many other places. And that is also why we organize this conference every year: we desire that people become familiar with who Jesus is and with the powerful work of the Holy Spirit.\"\nAccording to the foundation, Flach is retiring from his position on July 1 but sees Opwekking continuing on a trajectory to win souls for Jesus Christ.\n\"The Pentecost Conference no longer belongs to Opwekking, but to the Netherlands. Given by God to us all,\" he told the crowd.\n***Please sign up for\nCBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\nDid you know?\nGod is everywhere—even in the news.

    "title": "La DANA regresa a Mallorca: alerta naranja de la AEMET y aviso del Govern a la ciudadanía",
    "text": "Mallorca se encuentra en alerta naranja durante este viernes 1 de noviembre por la DANA (sigla de depresión aislada en niveles altos) que ha dejado al menos 155 de fallecidos y decenas de desaparecidos en la provincia de Valencia. El pasado lunes, Manacor vivió los efectos de este fenómeno meteorológico con fuertes precipitaciones que dejaron 174 litros por metro cuadrado que provocaron inundaciones, carreteras cortadas e intervenciones de los Bomberos de Mallorca, una de ellas en la Rafa Nadal Academy. Para este viernes se espera que regrese la DANA. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología ha activado la alerta naranja en toda la isla por precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, llegando a acumularse 120 litros por metro cuadrado en algunas zonas de la isla en pocas horas. Las lluvias se mantendrán hasta el sábado 2 de noviembre, alargándose el aviso naranja hasta primera hora de la mañana. Con el avance de las horas la alerta desaparecerá, pero las precipitaciones se mantendrán a lo largo del día. Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en Mallorca y Menorca. Para coordinar posibles actuaciones conjuntas, la Dirección General de Emergencias ha reunido esta mañana al Grupo de Soporte Técnico del Plan con representantes, entre otros, de los Bomberos del Consell de Mallorca, Bomberos de Palma, Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, Guardia Civil, AEMET, Carreteras del Consell de Mallorca, Ibanat, SAMU 061, Recursos Hídricos y RiscBal. Así, ante la posibilidad de que se produzcan inundaciones como consecuencia de las intensas lluvias y dado que este viernes se celebra la festividad de Tost Sants, se han consensuado estas recomendaciones: Planificar las visitas a los cementerios en función de las condiciones meteorológicas y extremar las precauciones, prestando especial atención a las personas más vulnerables.\\n En el hogar, asegurar puertas y ventanas y quedarse en las zonas altas de la casa. Se aconseja también retirar del exterior todo lo que pueda ser arrastrado por el agua y trasladar medicamentos, documentos y elementos de valor, así como comida y agua potable a los lugares altos de la casa.\\n Se recomienda evitar los sótanos o zonas bajas, como garajes, y desconectar el interruptor general de electricidad en el caso de que el agua ya haya entrado en la casa.\\n En el exterior, aconsejan alejarse de torrentes y zonas inundables y, en zona urbana, buscar refugio en un edificio. No se aconseja caminar por zonas con agua en movimiento, ya que, cuanto más rápido corre el agua, más peligro hay.\\n Hay que evitar los desplazamientos en coche y, si es necesario circular, se debe moderar la velocidad y aumentar la distancia de seguridad. Se tiene que hacer por autopistas, autovías y carreteras principales. En caso de baja visibilidad, se debe detener el vehículo y señalizar su posición.\\n No se debe entrar en zonas inundables, aunque parezca que hay poca agua, ya que, con poca altura de agua, los coches flotan y son arrastrados fácilmente. Si el coche comienza a flotar y es arrastrado, hay que salir del vehículo de forma inmediata y, si no se puede por la puerta, se debe hacer por la ventana. En estos casos es recomendable abandonar el vehículo y dirigirse a zonas más altas en caso de que el coche quede inmovilizado por el agua o que el nivel de agua ya llegue al eje.\\n Aconsejan también llevar el móvil cargado y suficiente combustible en el vehículo y no aparcar en puentes, aceras o desembocaduras. En caso de emergencia, hay que llamar al 112.",
