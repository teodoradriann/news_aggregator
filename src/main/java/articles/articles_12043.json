    "text": "Congress candidate Imran Masood’s victory in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur turned into an outrageous display of celebration as his supporters created a ruckus on the roads and harassed women which led to panic in the area. A video of the incident has also become viral on social media.\nMultiple bikes and four-wheelers are seen blocking the busy road as the supporters of the politician raise slogans in favour of him and disrupt traffic. Now, the authorities have taken cognisance of the development and registered a case against fifty-five individuals.\nSaharanpur, Uttar Pradesh: Newly elected MP Imran Masood enjoys Rajput votes. Samajwadi type Rally afterwards in Rajput area pic.twitter.com/s8u6tWp6U2\n— Megh Updates (@MeghUpdates) June 6, 2024 The instance reportedly transpired on the night of 4th or 5th June after the results of the general election were announced. The instance happened near Kutubsher Police Station on Ambala Road. The supporters of Imran Masood can be heard yelling slogans and making a commotion in the footage due to which one side of the road was blocked and commuters had to face problems. The Senior Superintendent of Police in Saharanpur mentioned that a case had been filed against fifty unidentified and five named persons after taking notice of the widely shared video.\nCongress-Samajwadi Party candidate Imran Masood registered a massive victory and secured 547967 votes while his nearest rival Raghav Lakhanpal of the Bharatiya Janata Party received 483425 votes and the Bahujan Samaj Party candidate came in third place with 180353 votes. The Congress leader won by 64542 votes and as a result, his supporters took to the streets and celebrated by violating the rules and regulations. They took out a bike rally with hundreds of two-wheelers. Some bikes had one rider while others had three. They were hooting and even made obscene gestures towards the females as the cops watched helplessly. It was captured on camera by a bystander, who then posted it to social media where it rapidly gained popularity.\nSenior Superintendent of Police Dr Vipin Tada stated that he is aware of the video and all the CCTV footage of Ambala Road is being retrieved. He informed that a case would be filed and the accused would be prosecuted following the investigation. On the other hand, similar scenes were witnessed in Shamli and Muzaffarnagar during the processions of Samajwadi Party workers despite prohibition.\nMeanwhile, another video of the newly-appointed parliamentarian has surfaced in which he is thanking the Rajput community for voting for him while talking to his supporters and stating a famous proverb derived from the epic Ramayana, “Raghu kul reet sada chali aye, praan jaaye par vachan na jaaye. (We keep our tradition of giving our lives for the sake of fulfilling our promises at all costs).” He added that nothing could stand before the community and the BJP lost because of them.\nNotably, Imran Masood came into the limelight when he abused and issued death threats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 during his election campaign. He was contesting the Lok Sabha election from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh and during an election rally, he declared, “Narendra Modi se kaun ladega? Jo thok ke jawab dena jaane Modi. (Who will fight against Modi? The one who knows how to give it back to this Modi).” He then added, “Who Gujarat samaj raha hai, 4% Musalman hai Gujrat mei, yaha 42% Musalman hai. Yaha Gujarat bana denge, uski boti-boti kaat denge choti-choti. (If Modi tries to make Uttar Pradesh into Gujarat, then we will chop him into tiny pieces. I am not scared of getting killed or attacking someone. I will fight against Modi. He thinks UP is Gujarat. Only 4% of Muslims are there in Gujarat while there are 42% of Muslims in UP).”",

    "title": "Why the iPhone 17 Air might be the best \"Plus\" iPhone yet - Retail Technology Innovation Hub",
    "text": "This is why the iPhone 17 Air might be the best “Plus” iPhone yet\nApple has often refined its iPhone lineup in response to user habits. The iPhone 17 Air continues this process, taking over the spot once held by the discontinued “Plus” model. The “Plus” never fully aligned with long-term user expectations, but the Air enters the scene with a clearer purpose. It focuses on portability, a new design, and a specific role between standard and Pro models.\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be considered the most suitable replacement Apple has introduced for the former “Plus” category.\nThe iPhone 17 Lineup and the Air’s Role\nApple introduces four models under the iPhone 17 name: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and the new iPhone 17 Air. This marks the end of the “Plus” variant, which has not appeared to satisfy Apple’s expectations for mid-tier appeal.\nThe Air is not simply a rebranded version of the Plus. It targets a slightly different group which is looking for more portability but unwilling to sacrifice display size or certain design upgrades.\nThe Air model carries a screen size of around 6.6 inches. That places it between the standard iPhone 17 and the Pro Max, both in terms of physical dimensions and expected pricing. Apple positions it as a middle offering, not a flagship, but above entry level. It fills a space between cost-efficiency and premium design that has, until now, remained slightly underdeveloped in the iPhone catalogue.\niPhone 17 Air: Apple’s Slimmest iPhone Yet\nThe Air’s defining trait is its size. It is not only regarding the screen, but the overall thickness. At roughly 6mm or less, it is likely Apple’s thinnest phone in years. This design marks a return to sleek hardware decisions last emphasised during the launch of the iPhone X. The flat edges remain, but the reduced depth gives it a lighter feel and a visual shift from the Pro models, which are generally heavier and thicker due to their feature load.\nWith its ultra-thin design and likely emphasis on portability, the iPhone 17 Air seems tailored for users who rely on their phones as their primary device. Mobile becomes the go to platform for tasks once done on desktop, so the demand for immersive, high performance apps continues to grow, especially in the entertainment world, games and online slots, where visual fidelity and responsiveness are key to the experience.\nModern slot games are designed to run very well on smartphones, so playing on mobile means people can play online slot games at their convenience. This weight and size reduction changes the feel of the device. It brings it closer to the MacBook Air and iPad Air naming strategy that it needs to be lightweight, minimalistic, and designed for daily utility.\nPrice and Market Positioning\nInitial speculation about the Air suggested that it might surpass the Pro Max in price. This is not the case. The Air positions itself between the standard iPhone 17 and the Pro models. It is not intended to compete with the Pro Max in terms of specifications or materials. Its pricing strategy reflects the replacement of the “Plus” tier. A tier that aimed for screen size without Pro-level performance.\nThe Air does not carry features like ProMotion or Always-On display technology. Those remain tied to the higher-end models. This pricing logic keeps the Air as a mid-tier option, suited for users who prioritise screen size and modern design but do not need every new hardware feature offered on Pro models. That places it in a more refined niche than the Plus ever occupied.\nDesign Differentiation from the Pro and Standard Models\nDespite its mid-range positioning, the iPhone 17 Air presents several notable design changes. These do not necessarily involve premium materials but reflect deliberate structural choices. The camera layout is empowered. It gives the back of the phone a different appearance. Though still using dual or triple lenses, their configuration sets the Air apart visually from the rest of the lineup.\nThe increased screen size, up from the standard model’s 6.3 inches to approximately 6.6 inches, also gives the Air a stronger viewing presence. Still, it manages to weigh less and offer a slimmer frame. This combination may appeal to users who found previous large screen iPhones too heavy or bulky for single-hand use. Apple likely designed this model for people who prioritise comfort, visual appeal, and portability, while still expecting more than the base configuration.\nComparison to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro\nWhere the standard iPhone 17 targets the entry level, and the Pro delivers high end performance, the Air serves a new midpoint. It carries neither the advanced display features of the Pro nor the simplified structure of the base model. Its function is not to bridge the two but to offer a standalone alternative.\nIt matches the Pro in screen size but excludes some performance features. Its appearance may reflect a hybrid identity that is distinct from the minimalist 17 and the utility heavy Pro. This balance may be where it finds its audience. The Air does not attempt to attract power users. It speaks to those who expect design fluency, convenience, and moderate technical capability.\nThe “Plus” model tried to do this as well but suffered from unclear differentiation. The Air, by contrast, begins with clearer separation based on form and pricing.\nRationale Behind Dropping the “Plus”\nThe removal of the “Plus” model is not surprising. It consistently fell into an awkward space. It offered size but lacked distinguishing features to justify its place between the standard and Pro tiers.\nThe Air avoids the trap of being a size upgrade alone. It introduces design distinctions that distance it from the models above and below. This addresses the core issue that limited the appeal of the “Plus.”\nThat model never fully delivered a compelling reason for users to skip either the more affordable base model or the feature rich Pro version. By altering form, structure, and possibly weight, the Air resets that middle ground with different dimensions and with an actual change in design philosophy.\nDisplay and Performance Expectations\nThe iPhone 17 Air does not use ProMotion or Always-On displays. These features remain reserved for the Pro and Pro Max models. The Air is expected to feature the same display resolution and colour calibration found in other non-Pro phones. It still represents a visual upgrade over older models or entry-level phones.\nThe display is likely aimed at balance in place of peak performance. Apple likely assumes that those interested in high refresh rates and advanced graphical processing will look toward the Pro lineup. The Air, on the other side, maintains display quality within a range acceptable for mainstream use.\nIts performance targets casual and moderate users. This includes those who browse regularly, stream content, use productivity apps, or manage files and communication heavily via phone. By keeping its technical ceiling lower than the Pro line, it helps distinguish its place in the lineup while meeting general-use expectations.\nToday, retailers focus on frictionless mobile interaction, including payment and checkout UX, so devices like the iPhone 17 Air are well placed to support that without overcommitting to high-spec hardware.\nNaming Strategy and Apple’s Product Structure\nThe naming of the “Air” fits a broader naming system that Apple has used with other devices. In the Mac and iPad lines, “Air” products are thinner and simpler, with reduced feature sets compared to the “Pro” versions. Applying this structure to the iPhone lineup gives users an immediate sense of what to expect.\nThis system clarifies intent. It removes the ambiguity that surrounded the “Plus” models. By borrowing from an established naming framework, Apple signals to buyers that the Air is part of a leaner, lighter product family, but not one that tries to push into Pro territory or expand on the base model’s specifications. That makes the Air easier to classify and possibly easier to market.\nThis also reflects a clearer separation across price points and features. That distinction helps it step into the space the Plus never quite settled.",

    "text": "The pope has left open the option of resigning if he became unable to carry out his duties\nPope Francis, who has been diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs, passed a \"peaceful night\", the Vatican said Wednesday, amid growing concerns over the 88-year-old's condition.\nThe pontiff was admitted with bronchitis last week after suffering breathing difficulties, but has since developed pneumonia in both of his lungs.\n\"The pope spent a peaceful night, woke up and had breakfast,\" the Vatican said after Francis's fifth night at the Gemelli hospital in Rome.\nOn Tuesday, the Vatican had reported that Francis was in \"good spirits\", adding that he had been alternating resting and reading in the suite reserved for popes on the 10th floor of the hospital.\nBut in a late evening medical bulletin, it warned that \"the laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father's clinical condition continue to present a complex picture\".\nA \"polymicrobial infection\" which has come on top of \"bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, and which required the use of cortisone antibiotic therapy, makes therapeutic treatment more complex\", the Vatican said.\n\"The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy,\" it added.\nThe pontiff had part of his right lung cut away when he was 21, after developing pleurisy that almost killed him.\nThe Vatican has cancelled a papal audience on Saturday and said the pope will not attend a mass on Sunday, although it has yet to announce plans for his weekly Angelus prayer, which is held on Sunday at midday.\nCandles, some with pictures of the pope on them, have been set at the bottom of a statue of Pope John Paul II outside the Gemelli hospital, where pilgrims have been coming to pray.\n\"I came to say a prayer for the pope so that he may recover soon. I send him my best wishes\", Jacqueline Troncoso, a Bolivian resident in Rome, told AFP late Tuesday.\nThe Vatican published drawings done by children in the hospital for Francis, as well as letters from parents asking him to pray for their sick offspring.\nFrancis, the head of the Catholic Church since 2013, was admitted to hospital after struggling for several days to read his texts in public.\nJesuit theologian Antonio Spadaro, who is close to Francis, told Italy's Corriere della Sera daily the pope could be in hospital for two to three weeks.\n\"It is clear that the situation is delicate, but I have not perceived any form of alarmism\", he said.\nThe pope \"has an extraordinary vital energy. He is not a person who lets himself go, he is not a resigned man. And that is a very positive element, we have seen that in the past\", he said.\nThe pneumonia is the latest of a series of health issues for the Jesuit, who has undergone hernia and colon surgery since 2021 and uses a wheelchair due to pain in his knee.\nThe pope has left open the option of resigning if he became unable to carry out his duties.\nBut in a memoir last year he said it was just a \"distant possibility\" that would be justified only in the event of \"a serious physical impediment\".\nSign up for the Daily Briefing\nGet the latest news and updates straight to your inbox",
