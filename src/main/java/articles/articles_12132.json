    "text": "FILE PHOTO: Federal Trade Commission seal is seen at a news conference at FTC Headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 24, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Melissa Holyoak said on Thursday the agency should look into how artificial-intelligence products use the data they gather from younger users, amid privacy and safety concerns.\nHolyoak, one of two Republicans on the commission who could end up as its acting chair after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, said the agency should review what authority it has to gather information about AI privacy practices regarding children.\nThe former Utah solicitor general gave the example of kids using AI services in the way older generations looked to a Magic 8 Ball fortune-telling toy, asking, \"should I go to the dance?\"\n\"Who is collecting that? Who has that information? Where is that information going?\" Holyoak said during a speech at an American Bar Association antitrust meeting in Washington.\nThe FTC enforces the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which regulates how platforms collect younger users' data, and has sued TikTok over alleged violations.\nThe FTC is headed for a shakeup when its current chair, Lina Khan, steps down or is replaced by a Trump-appointed successor. Khan's fight against corporate consolidation in the name of consumers won fans among Democrats and some Republicans, including Vice President-elect JD Vance. But she has drawn criticism from some in the business community over her aggressive approach.\nKhan has said that greater scrutiny of deals deters mergers that would illegally harm competition.\nHolyoak said the FTC should not take a dogmatic approach towards mergers and acquisitions.\n\"We are not in the business of trying to stop deals to just stop deals,\" she said.\nHolyoak also said she thinks the FTC will lose its appeal defending the worker noncompete ban. Holyoak did not comment on vocal support for the ban from former U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz, Trump's pick for attorney general.\n\"I think we all could benefit from the court and the Supreme Court weighing in on this issue,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in Washington; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nOpen Modal × Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

    "text": "Winter Storm Watch issued for entire Cincinnati area: Heavy snow, sleet, ice all possible\nFriday’s brush with some overnight snow showers is just the first brush with winter weather as we head into the weekend.\nA Winter Storm Watch has been issued for the entire Greater Cincinnati area that will go into effect Sunday morning through Monday evening.\nFor Friday, plan on snow through 8 a.m. Around an inch of snow looks likely for most. This will likely impact the morning commute on Friday, especially on untreated roads.\nA Winter Weather Advisory is in place through Friday morning for areas that could see closer to 2 inches of snow in Fayette and Union counties in Indiana and Warren, Clinton and Highland counties in Ohio. After the snow ends around 8 a.m., it gets cold. Temperatures will be in the 20s in the afternoon but feel like the teens.\nCold and dry weather lasts Saturday. Highs feel more like the teens.\nA winter storm takes aim at Greater Cincinnati Sunday into Monday. Nailing down the track is still up in the air, but early outlooks still bring a heavy snow in Sunday around midday. At some point, a wintry mix looks possible. That brings the chance for sleet and or freezing rain, which would cut back snow totals where that happens. It's likely that we switch back to snow at some point Monday as the system moves out. Significant impacts to travel look likely, but much is to be determined (totals and timing) beyond that.\nA cold stretch settles in through the first full week of January. By Wednesday, dangerously cold wind chills struggle to make it out of the single digits.",

    "title": "Governor Hochul Signs Legislation to Encourage the Safe Use of E-bikes and Lithium-Ion Batteries and Protect New Yorkers",
    "text": "Governor Kathy Hochul today signed a legislative package to raise awareness about the safe use of e-bikes and products that contain lithium-ion batteries and protect New Yorkers. As e-bikes have surged in popularity, these new laws build on Governor Hochul’s number one priority of keeping New Yorkers safe both on and off the road.\n“As e-bike adoption increases and battery technology continues to develop, I urge New Yorkers to be aware of safety best practices and to use their devices and chargers properly,” Governor Hochul said. “These laws underscore our commitment to help New Yorkers make educated, safe, smart choices with their purchases of products with lithium-ion batteries and how to best store and use them in order prevent any more tragedies from occurring.”\nLegislation S.154F/A.4938-D prohibits the sale of lithium-ion batteries used in micro-mobility devices, bicycles with electric assist or mopeds unless such batteries are manufactured in accordance with certain standards and specifications. Legislation S.154F/A.4938-D provides a civil penalty and authorizes district attorneys, county attorneys, and corporation counsel to have concurrent authority to seek the relief.\nLegislation S.8743/A.9338 directs the Department of State, in consultation with the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, to develop and maintain safety resources, information, and protocols in regard to fire hazard prevention relating to, but not limited to, lithium-ion batteries, second-use lithium-ion batteries, bicycles with electric assist as defined in section one hundred two-c of the vehicle and traffic law, mopeds, and micro-mobility devices.\nLegislation S.8742/A.9337 requires the State Fire Administrator within the Office of Fire Prevention and Control of the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Services to provide training materials for first responders regarding emergency response to incidents involving lithium-ion batteries.\nLegislation S.7503-B/A.01910-B requires retailers of micro-mobility devices, bicycles with electric assist and mopeds powered with lithium-ion batteries, and lithium-ion batteries intended for use in such devices or bicycles to provide customers with an operating manual.\nLegislation S.9419/A.7628-A requires police and judicial officers investigating an accident with an e-bike or e-scooter that results in death or injury to make a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles, consistent with current requirements for motor vehicles and motorcycles. Legislation S.9419/A.7628-A also requires police to investigate such incidents when they are made aware of them.\nLegislation S.7703-B/A.8450-B requires mopeds to be registered by dealers at the point of sale, if they are to be used in the State.\nLegislation S.7760-A/A.8102-A requires micro-mobility devices, mopeds, and bicycles with electric assist to have a red tag attached to the charging cord which states to unplug when not in use.\nLegislation S.7744-D/A.8310-C requires retailers to affix a notice on any bicycles with electric assist and micro-mobility devices which states to always yield to pedestrians and follow traffic laws. This legislation also authorizes that any retail entity who violates the law may be penalized with a fine of no more than $250 per unit for the first offense and not more than $1,000 for each subsequent offense.\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles Commissioner and Chair of the Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee Mark J.F. Schroeder said, “I applaud the Governor’s and Legislature’s actions to promote the safety of e-bikes and to raise awareness of the dangers of lithium-ion batteries. These are important steps to keep New Yorkers safe. Before buying an e-bike, familiarize yourself with everything you need to do to maintain it safely and prevent fires.”\nSecretary of State Walter T. Mosley said, “E-bikes and other products powered by lithium-ion batteries are being used more and more in our everyday lives, but many consumers are unaware of the potential dangers they pose when not handled properly. It’s critical for New York consumers to understand how to safely use, charge and store these products to help prevent accidents and injuries. These new laws not only put necessary precautions in place, they will also help to increase awareness and provide educational resources that can help keep New Yorkers safe.”\nDivision of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said, “As the use of these batteries continues to grow, so does the potential for more fires caused by them. New York State Fire has trained nearly 5,000 firefighters statewide on lithium-ion battery emergencies and we will continue to expand these educational tools that will save lives and property.”\nNew York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “The guidelines and manufacturing standards adopted for e-mobility devices, such as e-bikes or e-scooters, powered by lithium-ion batteries are essential to helping more consumers use flexible, clean, electric modes of transportation. Understanding safety requirements and protocols, information on purchasing, storage, and avoiding risks are ways that we can work together to ensure that New Yorkers maximize benefits while lowering exposure as we build a more sustainable future.”\nState Senator Cordell Cleare said, “Lithium-Ion Battery Fires have proliferated in Senate District 30 and I have been diligently working on crafting proactive solutions all year long. I commend Governor Hochul for signing this essential legislative package which includes three bills that I am the proud Prime Sponsor of. Starting today, New Yorkers will benefit from enhanced protections and informed interventions that will minimize and mitigate the likelihood of new fires by increasing safety, awareness, training and outreach.”\nState Senator Iwen Chu said, “Electric assist mobility devices are essential for New York workers, but the dangers posed by lithium-ion batteries have gone unchecked for too long and have led to too many fires in our communities. Today, we take a significant step forward in safeguarding our communities with the signing of legislations to enhance the safety use of lithium-ion batteries and street safety. These measures, including establishing clear charging cords directions, and requiring retailers selling e-bikes to include notice of proper rules, will promote safer charging habits, raise awareness about street safety, and help prevent accidents.”\nState Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal said, “There are far too many unlicensed mopeds on our streets, and even worse, on our sidewalks. I’ve received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue, which is why I hosted a symposium this spring at the Midtown Community Justice Center with government colleagues and stakeholders to seek policy solutions to the growing problem of e-bikes and mopeds. The legislation being signed today by Governor Hochul is a direct outcome of our symposium and will require mopeds to be registered and licensed at the point of sale — before leaving the premises of moped retailers. With this new law in effect, more registered mopeds will mean easier enforcement of our traffic laws and safer streets. I thank the Governor, with whom I’ve had conversations about this issue, along with Senate Majority Leader Stewart-Cousins and my colleague Assembly Member Bores, for helping get this bill passed and signed today.”\nState Senator Liz Krueger said, “Micromobility devices are here to stay, and their use is continuing to expand, so we must act quickly to ensure they are used in a responsible way that doesn't put other people at risk. Unsafe batteries are contributing to a serious threat to the health and safety of New Yorkers in their homes and in their jobs, whether it's delivery workers trying to make a living, or residential tenants living next to a fly-by-night charging business. When a piece of equipment has the potential to cause so much damage, we simply cannot have a wild west approach without any oversight. I thank Governor Hochul for signing these important bills today.”\nState Senator Jeremy Cooney said, “Far too often, poorly manufactured batteries injure electric scooter and bicycle users and in some occasions have cost people their lives. This is unacceptable. I commend Governor Hochul for signing my bill to require the safe usage of lithium-ion batteries in electric scooters and bicycles-a long overdue standard for the safety of New Yorkers.”\nState Senator Luis Sepúlveda said, “Today's legislative package is a critical step toward ensuring the safety and well-being of all New Yorkers. By addressing the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries, we are taking proactive measures to protect our communities, empower our first responders with the necessary training, and promote the safe use of these essential technologies. I applaud Governor Hochul for her leadership and dedication to this cause, and I am proud to support these vital initiatives.”\nState Senator Brian Kavanagh said, “I am proud to stand with Governor Kathy Hochul and our colleagues in the legislature as we enact this crucial legislative package aimed at protecting New Yorkers and promoting responsible use of electric bikes and scooters, and the lithium-ion batteries that power them. With the rapid and widespread adoption of these desirable and environmentally responsible modes of transportation, we must take action to prevent accidents and tragedies and to empower individuals to make informed choices that contribute to a safer, more sustainable future. Together, we can harness the potential of these innovative technologies while ensuring the well-being of our communities and preserving the environment for generations to come.”\nAssemblymember Alex Bores said, “E-bikes are fast, but today we showed that New York's government moves even faster. E-bike and moped use has surged in New York City. Our report last year found that an e-bike was 27 times more likely to cause a death than a normal bicycle. This package of common-sense bills will keep New Yorkers safer from battery fires and collisions. By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.”\nAssemblymember Christopher W. Eachus said, “This legislation will save the lives of everyday New Yorkers. As a former physics teacher, I worked with lithium-ion batteries for years. I understand how dangerous they can be if not handled properly. Something as simple as placing a red tag on the charging cord as a reminder to unplug the cord when not in use can help prevent future deadly fires. I thank my colleagues in the legislature for passing this bill, and I thank Governor Hochul for signing this important piece of public safety legislation.”\nAssemblymember Manny De Los Santos said, “The fire hazards caused by lithium-ion batteries have resulted in the loss of people’s homes, injuries, and the loss of life due to a lack of information on proper usage and a lack of safety standards. The resources and protocols produced by the Department of State under these new laws will allow consumers and suppliers to be more informed about the proper use of these batteries and the devices that power them. This information, along with the series of measures signed into law today by Governor Hochul, will help keep people and people’s homes safe.”\nAssemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz said, “Lithium-ion batteries are the number one cause of fire deaths in New York City. This legislation will go a long way toward addressing this horrible problem. I appreciate the work of State Senator Liz Kruger on our bill, and I thank Governor Hochul for signing this life-saving legislation.”\nAssemblymember Stefani Zinerman said, “For the past two years, we've collaborated with the FDNY to raise awareness about the hazards of lithium batteries. Thanks to these efforts, New Yorkers now have the knowledge to protect themselves and their communities, safeguarding both commercial and residential properties. I am grateful to my colleagues in government for their advocacy and partnership on this vital legislative package.”\nAssemblymember Al Taylor said, “As a New York State legislator representing the 71st Assembly District, I am immensely proud to see our efforts come to fruition with the signing of this crucial legislation by Governor Hochul. Our district, like many areas in New York City, has experienced numerous fires caused by lithium-ion batteries, highlighting the urgent need for this bill. This new law ensures that our emergency responders are equipped with the specialized training they need to protect our communities and enhance public safety. This legislation represents a significant step towards improving public safety and underscores our commitment to proactive, forward-thinking solutions for the challenges we face. I am so pleased that we are signing this package of bills. I thank Governor Hochul for her support and dedication to safeguarding the well-being of all New Yorkers.”\nAssemblymember Nily Rozic said, “As Chair of Consumer Protection, I am proud to have moved this package of bills that prioritizes micromobility safety and mitigates lithium-ion battery fire risks across New York. These bills represent a step forward in supporting public safety and sustainable transportation options and I am grateful to Governor Hochul for signing them into law.”\nAssemblymember Rebecca A. Seawright said, “Lithium-ion battery fires and careless e-vehicle usage pose deadly threats to our communities. With the enactment of today’s legislative package, which I proudly co-sponsor, we will secure these growing technologies and require accountable use for all New Yorkers. No one should fear navigating their own neighborhoods.”\nAssemblymember Deborah Glick said, “I was pleased that we were able to pass several bills this Session that will protect pedestrians who are forced to be vigilant while navigating around e-bikes and scooters, ensure the safety of those who rely on e-bikes for transportation, and require safe handling and use of lithium-ion batteries. Gray market batteries continue to present a danger not only to users but to all of us. We all must follow the rules of the road and do more to ensure the safety of those who could be inadvertently harmed by unregulated micro-mobility devices or the batteries that power them, and I applaud the Governor for signing this important package of legislation.”\nAssemblymember Steve Otis said, “Thank you to Governor Hochul and her team for prioritizing these bills to alert consumers and improve safety of lithium battery use. Risks to first responders and the public can be reduced by making sure everyone follows proper use, storage, and charging practices so that we can benefit from this emerging technology.”\nAssemblymember Jessica González-Rojas said, “In my district, constituents have reached out regularly because there have been e-bike and moped incidents, and they want our streets to be safer. Today, our state is taking several steps to not just signal to New Yorkers that we care about their safety but to do things to make them safer. I'm proud to have co-sponsored several of these bills and thank my colleagues and the advocates for getting them across the finish line and Governor Hochul for signing them into law. It is incumbent on all of us to work together to keep our neighbors safe.”\nAssemblymember Charles D. Fall said, “In recent months, we have witnessed numerous incidents involving these batteries causing deadly fires in my district, including Staten Island and Lower Manhattan. I want to thank Governor Hochul for her leadership in moving these lifesaving bills into law. These new measures will ensure safer standards and provide critical resources for first responders and consumers alike, significantly enhancing safety and saving lives.”\nAssemblymember Steven Raga said, “It's imperative that our government is responsive to the consumer safety needs that arise when new technology becomes available to New Yorkers. Today's package of bills is indicative of a responsive government and will keep New Yorkers safe through stronger regulations and consumer safety practices.”\nAssemblymember David Weprin said, “I applaud Governor Hochul for signing these bills that will protect New Yorkers into law today. Far too often we hear stories on the local news of fires that originate from lithium ion batteries, causing damage, destruction, and sometimes loss of life. These new batteries need to be regulated so residents can feel safe. New Yorkers should be protected and be able to feel safe at home.”\nNew York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, “Deadly fires caused by lithium-ion batteries have taken an increasingly devastating toll on our communities and New Yorkers, underscoring the importance of advancing solutions at every level of government. The signing of this critical state legislation into law builds on the work of the City Council, which has taken decisive actions to curb fires and save lives. While more work is required to mitigate these preventable tragedies, we remain dedicated to working together to bolster protections and safeguard all New Yorkers.”\nNew York City Council Member Gale A. Brewer said, “Lawmakers have to stay focused on rider responsibility and battery safety as New Yorkers transition to e-bikes, scooters, and other legal micromobility devices. There are some legislative changes that can only be made by the State, so I thank the legislature and governor for passing and enacting these much needed laws. I am confident they will make a big difference in New York City.”\nNew York City Council Member Rita Joseph said, “I remain deeply committed to the safety and well-being of our community and I am proud to support this legislative package on lithium-ion batteries. These measures will ensure that only high-quality batteries are sold, provide crucial safety resources, and offer vital training for our first responders. By mandating operating manuals and enhancing reporting on e-bike and e-scooter accidents, we are taking significant steps to protect New Yorkers. This comprehensive approach underscores the dedication and commitment to public safety and technological progress, making our streets and homes safer for everyone.”\nNew York City Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh said, “Lithium-ion batteries are a dangerous problem we have worked tirelessly to address. We are grateful to Governor Hochul and our leaders in the state for their partnership on this issue. We implore New Yorkers to use best practices when it comes to these devices, and think about their safety, the safety of their families, their neighbors and first responders.”\nNew York City Police Department Commissioner Edward A. Caban said, “Many unregistered scooters and limited-use motorcycles not only pose a risk to pedestrians and other motorists when driven recklessly, but also diminish safety along New York City’s tourist and commercial corridors because they facilitate chain-snatching, armed robberies, and other violence. While the NYPD continues to remove record numbers of illegal motorized bikes from our streets and sidewalks, this commonsense law will halt the problem right at the point of purchase, helping us fight crime and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers.”\nNew York City Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “Legal micromobility offers safe and convenient options for New Yorkers to get around the city. By banning uncertified batteries and requiring mopeds to be registered at the point of sale, we can help stop the spread of dangerous, illegal devices and reduce fires from unregulated equipment. We thank the Governor and our partners in the Legislature for their support.”\nThe Uniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro says, “That the unprecedented increase in fires, serious injuries and deaths due to unregulated or remanufactured e-bike batteries needed to be addressed. Governor Hochul’s new legislation that prohibits the sale of Lithium batteries that are not up to industry standards will protect the health, safety and well being of both New Yorkers, and New York Firefighters.\"\nThese new laws build on the “Buy Safe, Charge Safe” statewide campaign Governor Hochul announced earlier this year to raise awareness about the dangers of lithium-ion battery fires. This multi-agency effort aims to educate consumers about how to properly purchase, use, charge and maintain devices with lithium-ion batteries, and the potential dangers of their improper use.",

    "text": "Thursday, December 28th 2023, 4:40 pm Pineapples, known to have many impressive health benefits, are now being used to treat patients with deep burns. A Long Island man severely burned by his fire pit was one of the first patients to receive the treatment since the Food and Drug Administration gave approval. \"Just to be in a ball of flame was indescribable,\" said Charles Garrison. Garrison, a disabled Mastic man, was burned while using his backyard fire pit. \"It flashed up and the gas came out, hit my leg and I went up like a torch,\" he said. \"The pants I was wearing melted and when I took the pants off that were on fire, the skin slid off the leg.\" Just one month later, he's healing without any of the surgery or skin grafting that's been the standard of deep burn care for decades. Garrison's burned legs are still tough to look at, but vastly improved thanks to the novel new treatment recently approved by the FDA. \"It wouldn't have been available if I did it the day before. I just lucked out,\" said Garrison. Stony Brook Medicine doctors called it a game changer. Garrison was among the first in the nation to be treated with NexoBrid, cream derived from the stems and cores of pineapples. \"Enzymes present in the pineapple, bromelain is actually the enzyme which actually does all of the work for us,\" said Dr. Steven Sandoval, medical director at Stony Brook Medicine's burn center. The cream dissolves the burned, dead tissue and stops at healthy tissue. \"Within four hours, it completely dissolves the dead tissue. It's very selective, so it leaves the normal tissue alive,\" said Dr. Adam Singer. \"Patients can have this done and not require any surgical intervention,\" said Sandoval. The treatment came to Stony Brook by way of Israel, where Singer trained 30 years ago. He recently completed a study on its effectiveness. \"This has completely revolutionized the was we take care of burns,\" said Singer. In a matter of months, Garrison will begin to seek actual skin and hair instead of enduring months of surgery and painful skin grafts. \"To a burn surgeon, this is fantastic. This is, you're showing signs of healing, the growth of new skin, new tissue,\" said Sandoval. Garrison's scars are expected to look as good, if not better, than skin grafting. \"He offered me no promises, but gave be the world,\" said Garrison. \"So now everybody calls me the pineapple guy. When I make my appointments, it's the pineapple treatment.\" The drug was also developed for mass casualty events when a large number of people have suffered burns.

    "text": "Cerca de meia centena de oficiais de justiça manifestaram-se hoje diante do Ministério da Justiça, em Lisboa, com críticas ao acordo assinado em junho com o Sindicato dos Funcionários Judiciais (SFJ) e exigindo a revisão da tabela salarial. A concentração foi desencadeada por um movimento espontâneo de trabalhadores, em cujas reivindicações o Sindicato dos Oficiais de Justiça (SOJ) também se revê e apoia, esperando abrir novo processo negocial com a tutela, depois do acordo de junho que consagrou o aumento do suplemento de recuperação processual. \"A ministra da Justiça tornou público que estavam representados 87% dos oficiais de justiça e a verdade é que nem sequer 40% dos oficiais de justiça se revê nesse acordo. A esmagadora maioria não se revê, quer que haja negociações sérias, uma revisão da tabela salarial e que este sindicato possa levar a cabo esse desiderato que a carreira quer\", disse à Lusa o presidente do SOJ, Carlos Almeida. O dirigente esclareceu já ter pedido uma reunião à ministra Rita Alarcão Júdice, mas criticou a ausência de resposta da tutela, assegurando também que o acordo não trouxe paz aos tribunais, depois de mais de um ano de greves sucessivas (e que se mantêm da parte do SOJ). \"A conflitualidade continua a existir. A procuradora-geral da República salientou há pouco tempo no parlamento: só vamos ter conhecimento do impacto destas greves daqui a um ano ou dois, mas nós, nas secretarias judiciais, já temos a perceção de que serão milhares e milhares de processos que vão prescrever ou já estão a prescrever neste momento\", disse. Carlos Almeida denunciou também que é necessário travar violações ao estatuto profissional da carreira antes da elaboração de um novo estatuto, ao apontar como exemplo o último concurso aberto, e referiu que só a revisão imediata da tabela salarial pode conferir maior atratividade à carreira. \"Tem de ser revista, há mais de 20 anos que não é revista. Essa é a prioridade, até para tornarmos a carreira atrativa e que se possa integrar pessoas na carreira e manterem-se no exercício das funções de oficial de justiça\", sustentou, continuando: \"O Estado de Direito não está a ser realizado em Portugal, pelo menos nas secretarias, e isso tem de ter um fim\". A apresentação da proposta de Orçamento do Estado em outubro é, no entender do líder do SOJ, o prazo limite para encontrar uma solução que vá ao encontro dos anseios da classe. \"Esperamos que venha lá contemplada a verba para dar resposta aos problemas dos oficiais de justiça. Se depois dessa data percebermos que não está lá colocada essa verba, teremos de enveredar por outras formas de luta que não só a greve\", avisou.",

    "text": "The Orlando-area theme parks see millions of visitors each year, and between the 100+° weather and the physical exertion it takes to navigate the parks, it’s no surprise that in-park injuries are reported from time to time.\nWelcome to Walt Disney World Each year, the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services publishes its “ MOU Exempt Facilities Report ,” which documents serious ride-related Injuries at Orlando theme parks, including Walt Disney World, Universal, Busch Gardens, LEGOLAND, and SeaWorld. Now, we have the data from last year, and the document reveals the most commonly reported injuries in 2024.\nIt is important to note that the MOU Exempt Facilities Report does not cover minor incidents; the injuries recorded in this document are only serious incidents that required hospitalization for at least 24 hours.\nMagic Kingdom In 2024, 46 serious injuries were reported between Walt Disney World, Universal, Busch Gardens, LEGOLAND, and SeaWorld. The majority of those injured were 65+ years old (about 37%), while 28% were 45-60 years old. Ten of those injured were 30-45 years old, four were 20-30 years old, and two were less than 20 years old.\nMagic Kingdom As we mentioned, the injuries recorded in this document were serious incidents that required hospitalization for at least 24 hours. Of those injuries, ten were reported as “Syncope/Loss of Consciousness.” Five people experienced “Nausea/Emesis,” and five cases were labeled as “Dizziness.” Below, you can see the full list of injuries reported in 2024:\nSyncope/Loss of Consciousness: 10 Nausea/Emesis: 5 Dizziness: 5 Injury while entering/exiting attraction: 5 Chest Pains: 5 Seizure: 5 Shortness of Breath: 4 Headache/Head Pain: 3 Motion Sickness: 2 Vomiting: 1 Cardiac Event: 1 Dislodged medical device: 1 Leg Pain: 1 Back Pain: 1 Disoriented: 1 The most commonly reported incident in 2024 was fainting. While summer is the hottest part of the year in Orlando, only three of the ten syncope incidents happened between April and June 2024. Two cases were reported between October and December, and five cases were reported between January and March of 2024.\nEPCOT Disney World and Universal appear to have the most reported incidents in 2024, though these parks likely welcome thousands more guests than the other three smaller theme parks in Orlando.\nChina Pavilion Looking for more details about the 2024 MOU Exempt Facilities Report ? We’ve got everything you need to know about these injuries, where they happened, and the attractions that had the highest number of reported injuries. Check out the full story below.\nNew Report Reveals All the Ride-Related Injuries at Theme Parks in 2024 While these injuries are significant, it’s important to remember that there are ways to protect yourself from serious injuries. Drink lots of water on vacation — especially in the summer — and know your body’s limitations. It can be surprisingly easy to overdo it on vacation, but that can lead to some painful consequences.\nFirst Aid Center at Magic Kingdom Don’t forget that Orlando theme parks have First Aid Centers you can visit for minor injuries. Even if you just fall and scrape your arm, it’s important to clean your injury and protect it as soon as possible.\nFirst Aid at Blizzard Beach In the meantime, we’re always on the lookout for the latest Disney news, so stay tuned for more.\nI Got Hurt at Universal Orlando.

Israeli high-tech fundraising totaled $6.9 billion over 392 rounds according to a report released by IVC and LeumiTech.\nIN Q4/2023 – during which the Iron Swords War in Gaza was and is being fought – Israeli tech companies saw a decrease in both money raised and the total number of fundraises held of 15% and 16%, respectively, compared to Q3/2023. The totals in Q4 were $1.45 billion raised in 75 different deals.\nSeed rounds climbed to $220 million in 31 rounds, however.\nWill you offer us a hand?

A full report will be released in January.)\nThe report also found that fundraising activity in 2023 was similar to the long-term pattern found in 2018-2019. The data reflected a 44% decrease in the number of deals and a 56% drop in the amount of raised capital compared to 2022.\nLeumiTech CEO, Maya Eisen-Zafrir said “We continue to see in the 3rd quarter’s data the first signs of stabilization in the amount and scope of capital raising, which bring us to the levels of 2018-19.”\nShe added that there was still a decrease in initial investments (early rounds) saying that it was more moderate compared to what was seen.\n“In addition,” she added, “we recognize a stabilization in the rate of follow-on investments, an indication that the companies are beginning to adjust their value to the new interest rate environment.”\nAccording to Ben Klein, CEO of IVC, “The year 2023 was challenging for the Israeli economy in general, and local high-tech in particular. The results of the entire year, especially the fourth quarter, support an optimistic approach towards the local industry.”\nBut, explained Klein, despite the “complexity” foreign investors’ participation level was a “clear sign of the attractiveness of Israeli high-tech companies, even in difficult times.”",

    "text": "Researchers who found a giant freshwater turtle fossil discovered in Brazil have named it Peltocephalus maturin after a character in one of Stephen King’s novels.\nThe fossil was “among the largest freshwater turtles ever found,” researchers said in the release of their findings on Wednesday in the British journal Biology Letters.\n“Only a handful of them have crossed the 150 cm threshold in the past,” researchers said.\nBone samples found by gold miners in the Taquaras quarry in Porto Velho, Brazil, were sent to the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the University of Georgia to be analyzed, the researchers said. The findings were astounding: the shell of the fossil measured about 180 cm in length, an incredibly rare occurrence, and far larger than the 140 and 110 cm recorded for today’s freshwater turtles.\n“Today we have no idea how a freshwater turtle with a carapace of almost 2 meters looks like,” Dr. Gabriel S. Ferreira, lead study author and scientist at the Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution Palaeoenvironment at the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen in Germany.\n“What would our ancestors have thought if they really saw such a giant alive? Would they be afraid of it? Would they hunt it for food or worship it? Or both?” Ferreira wrote in an email to CBS News.\nThe turtle’s size inspired the etymology, Ferreira said. As researchers were casting around for a name, one of them, Miriam Pacheco, a big fan of King’s novels, suggested Maturin. The giant sea turtle is a recurring character in the author’s novels, a wise grandfather-like figure that serves as a guardian and protector.\n“See the TURTLE of enormous girth! On his shell he holds the earth. His thought is slow but always kind; He holds us all within his mind,” King wrote.\nOther findings showed a suspected omnivorous diet. Others point to the possibility that the giant turtle “inhabited the Amazon rainforest on the fringe of human occupation of the Americas.”\nScientists cautioned that “more data from the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene deposits of the Amazon basin are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.”\n“We hope this finding triggers further support to continue exploring and collecting more fossils in the region,” said Ferreira. “But also finding other fossils in the area might help us to better constraint their age and to understand the local fauna back then.”\nCara Tabachnick\nCara Tabachnick is a news editor and journalist at CBSNews.com.
