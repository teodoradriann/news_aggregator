    "text": "A thrifting expert has stunned the internet after revealing the secret trick for hunting down priceless items at thrift stores. Marie Chane, from Texas , took to TikTok to share a video of her friend shopping for wine glasses in the second-hand shop. The woman holds two items in her hands as she divulges the ingenious hack to decipher their true quality. The overlaid text in the clip read: 'Get you some friends who can teach you something.' Marie Chane, from Texas, took to TikTok to share a video of her friend shopping for wine glasses in the second-hand shop The woman holds two items in her hands as she divulges the ingenious hack to decipher their true quality In the clip, which has so far been viewed more than 10.1 million times, Marie recorded her fellow shopper 'explaining the difference between crystal and not crystal.' Her friend continued: 'So the way to check to see if something is pure crystal or just regular glass is to do the little \"thump test.\"' She then flicked her finger at the rim of the glass and listened to the subsequent sound. 'If it goes to just a [short] ring, it's glass,' the exert explained. 'Now the difference with crystal is you're going to hear that ring like a bell chime.' Having identified which of the two items in her hands was made out of crystal, she revealed that the high-quality product was being sold in the thrift store for just $1. The woman added: 'Chances are this is probably something like Waterford or Mikasa or one of those brands.' Given that crystal products often solicit hefty prices tags, finding similar thrifted products can save consumers from shelling out hundreds of dollars. And other social media users flooded to the comment section to praise the advice as one person wrote: 'This video just upgraded me' And other social media users flooded to the comment section to praise the advice as one person wrote: 'This video just upgraded me.' Another person commented: 'That's the clearest explanation I've ever heard. Thank you!' A third follower wrote: 'Yesss I feel upper class now that I know the difference.' 'Excuse me while I start flicking glasses at the thrift store lol,' a fourth person added. Other thrifting enthusiasts previously learned the trick from the popular movie Miss Congeniality (2000). In the film, actress Sandra Bullock assumes the role of Miss United States pageant contestant Gracie Heart, who is actually an undercover FBI agent. For the talent show section of the competition, Gracie used crystal wine glasses filled with varying degrees of water to create a harmony. One follower commented: 'Miss Congeniality taught me lmao. But your way is better.' Another commenter wrote: 'Crystals sings. I learned this in Miss Congeniality.'",

    "text": "Indigo, owner of Scarborough’s largest bookstore, Chapters at Kennedy Commons, says the store is closing permanently on Jan. 27. Its union says the store’s staff, 30 to 40 people in all, are not being offered jobs at other Chapters Indigo stores. Chapters 929 Union organized pickets around the store, an anchor of the Kennedy Road power centre for 24 years, before Christmas and on Boxing Day. In posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, the union alleges the company is treating Scarborough employees unfairly because they chose to unionize. “We’ve taken care of you, and now we hope you’ll take care of us,” one post said, asking members of the public to call Indigo and support employee transfers and a severance package that exceeds the legal minimum offered. In a statement this month, the company said it makes decisions to close stores based on many factors, including profitability. “As part of our normal business practices, we regularly review and optimize our real estate portfolio,” Indigo said. The company added it is “working closely with all employees to ensure they are fully supported” as the store closes, but a company spokesperson didn’t respond to an inquiry on why transfers were not being offered. A spokesperson for the union could not be reached for comment. Over a quarter century, the Kennedy Commons store hosted many events celebrating books and literacy. A long list of writers, including Scarborough author Catherine Hernandez, have signed a letter protesting the closing. The company, Canada's largest book retailer, still owns the smaller IndigoSpirit store at Scarborough Town Centre and Coles in Eglinton Square.",

    "text": "El presidente ruso Vladímir Putin ordenó a sus tropas invadir la vecina Ucrania el 24 de febrero de 2022. Desde entonces, la guerra sigue anclada en el este de Europa. Sigue al minuto las últimas noticias del avance militar de Rusia y de la respuesta de Kiev. Estados Unidos impulsa vías para alcanzar el fin de la guerra. La tregua está más cerca.\nActualizar 12 JUN 2025 - 9:00\nUcrania dice que bajas rusas, entre muertos y heridos, han superado el millón desde 2022 El ministro de Asuntos Exteriores ucraniano, Andrí Sibiga, afirmó este jueves que el número de bajas rusas ha superado el millón, entre muertos y heridos, en los casi tres años y medio desde que empezó la guerra en febrero de 2022. \"Un millón perdido para nada: Rusia no ha alcanzado ni uno solo de los objetivos estratégicos de sus objetivos a gran escala. Y no lo hará\", aseguró Sibiga en la red social X. El ministro subrayó que Ucrania no comenzó la guerra y quiere \"más que nadie\" que termine, pero que Rusia está obstaculizando todos los intentos para llegar a una solución negociada del conflicto, rechazando la propuesta de Kiev de un alto el fuego y de una reunión a nivel de presidentes. \"Hay que incrementar la presión sobre el agresor\", reclamó.\n12 JUN 2025 - 8:30\nAl menos 14 heridos en un nuevo ataque nocturno ruso contra Járkov Al menos 14 civiles resultaron heridos este jueves en un ataque nocturno con drones rusos contra la ciudad de Járkov, en el noreste de Ucrania, y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, un día después de que murieran tres personas y otras 60 fueran heridas en circunstancias similares. \"Por la noche, el enemigo atacó Járkov con drones. Se produjeron incendios en los distritos de Saltivski, Slobodski y Shevchenkivski de la ciudad; ardieron viviendas, locales comerciales y coches. 14 personas fueron heridas, incluidos cuatro niños\", informaron los servicios de emergencia del Estado en Telegram. Las labores de rescate y de apagado de incendios todavía continúan.\n11 JUN 2025 - 15:59\nSistema de misiles antiaéreos Patriot Rusia afirmó este miércoles haber recibido aclaraciones de lsrael acerca del supuesto envío de un sistema de misiles antiaéreos Patriot a Ucrania, que le permiten desmentir esta información. \"Hemos recibido aclaraciones del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Israel que indican que estas declaraciones no se corresponden con la realidad\", señaló en rueda de prensa la portavoz del Ministerio de Exteriores de Rusia, María Zajárova.\n11 JUN 2025 - 13:26\nRusia dice que sus tropas avanzan en la región ucraniana de Dnipropetrovsk Unidades de dos agrupaciones militares del Ejército ruso avanzan en la región ucraniana de Dnipropetrovsk tras cruzar la frontera de la región de Donetsk , según informó este miércoles el Ministerio de Defensa de este país. \"Unidades de la agrupación militar Este salieron a la frontera occidental de la República Popular de Donetsk y están llevando a cabo una ofensiva en el territorio de la región de Dnipropetrovsk\", señala la nota castrense. Según el parte militar, en esta dirección los ucranianos contaron con 225 bajas desde el último comunicado durante combates en las localidades de Shevchenko, en la región ucraniana de Donetsk, Guliáipole y Malínovka, en la región de Zaporiyia, a unos 100 kilómetros entre las capitales de ambas regiones.\n11 JUN 2025 - 12:55\nEl presidente de Serbia viaja a Ucrania por primera vez desde el inicio de la invasión rusa El presidente de Serbia , Aleksandar Vucic , aterrizará este miércoles en Ucrania en la que es su primera visita al país desde que comenzó la invasión rusa del territorio, un viaje que se enmarca en la cumbre que tendrá lugar en la ciudad de Odesa y en la que participarán más de una decena de líderes del sureste de Europa. Así lo ha confirmado la Presidencia serbia en un comunicado, en el que ha matizado que la visita de Vucic, que mantiene buenas relaciones y lazos históricos con Rusia, durará únicamente un día.\n11 JUN 2025 - 12:11\nRepatrian a Ucrania los restos mortales de más de 1.200 soldados caídos Los restos mortales de un total de 1 .212 soldados ucranianos caídos cuyos cadáveres estaban en manos de las autoridades rusas han sido retornados a Ucrania , según anunció este miércoles en un comunicado el órgano del Estado ucraniano que se ocupa de los prisioneros de guerra. Se trata del primer retorno de cadáveres que se anuncia desde que ucranianos y rusos acordaran el 2 de junio en Estambul canjear los restos mortales de 6.000 soldados de cada bando que están en posesión del enemigo.\n11 JUN 2025 - 8:33\nAl menos dos muertos y 60 heridos en un nuevo ataque ruso contra Járkov Al menos dos personas murieron y otras 60 resultaron heridas en un nuevo ataque con drones lanzado anoche por las fuerzas rusas contra la ciudad de Járkov , en el noreste de Ucrania y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, según ha informado la Policía ucraniana en un comunicado.
