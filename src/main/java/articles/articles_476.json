    "text": "CES 2025 Read and watch our complete CES coverage here Updated less than 0 just now ago Table of Contents Table of Contents Tech-savvy design remains unchanged Interior is still just a screen and a steering wheel UX is TBD Driver assist could make the difference What does this add up to?\nThe Sony car is almost here. After its creation via a joint venture with Honda in 2022 and two years’ worth of prototypes, the electronics giant’s Afeela brand is finally taking reservations for its first electric vehicle, with deliveries scheduled to start in 2026.\nBut will it be worth the wait? Coinciding with the opening of reservations, Sony Honda Mobility brought updated prototypes of the Afeela 1 (as it’s now officially known) to CES 2025 , representing what California customers (Afeela is only taking reservations in that state) who put down a $200 refundable deposit can expect when they take delivery.\nRecommended Videos This gave me the opportunity to finally sit behind the wheel of the Afeela 1, and while I wasn’t able to drive it out of Afeela’s booth in the cavernous Las Vegas Convention Center, I did get to experience some of the tech features that are really supposed to set this car apart from other EVs. But that still left a lot of questions.\nRelated Royal Enfield to introduce the Flying Flea electric motorcycle brand at CES 2025 Audi levels up its EV game with the A6 e-tron but still makes unforced errors Honda previews future EV lineup with Zero Series concepts Tech-savvy design remains unchanged Sony Honda Mobility In contrast to the many startups that have cannonballed into the EV pool in the wake of Tesla, Sony has taken a slow and methodical approach to launching its first car. It announced that intention at CES 2020 with the Vision S concept , an electric sedan much like the Afeela 1. It followed that up with the Vision S-02 , an SUV, before teaming up with Honda and then announcing the Afeela brand at CES 2023 .\nThat makes this the third time Afeela has shown the car it plans to sell at CES, although 2023’s version was more like a concept car, with a broad-strokes indication of the design direction and planned features. Afeela brought a more refined version to CES 2024, and made few apparent changes to the version shown at CES this year.\nThe near-production-ready version maintains a rounded, computer-mouse shape.\nThe near-production-ready version sitting under spotlights and behind ropes at CES 2025 maintains the rounded, computer-mouse shape Afeela has used all along. It also retains the “media bar,” a projection surface where the grille would normally be that lets drivers display cutesy messages like “Have a nice day” or PlayStation video-game wallpaper, as well as a bump in the center of the roof for a lidar unit. However, it’s now flanked by two cameras angled to either side for maximum field of view. They’re among 40 sensors for the Afeela’s driver-assist features.\nInside, it’s hard to spot any differences from last year’s prototype. The screen spans the dashboard and spills onto the doors. It’s mounted high to keep it closer to the driver’s line of sight, and Afeela employed a yoke-shaped steering wheel to further maximize visibility.\nInterior is still just a screen and a steering wheel Sony Honda Mobility It’s now safe to say that this really is the setup Afeela plans to go to production with, and at first glance it has some good points. I found it easy to glance at even the far-right parts of the screen without tilting my head down or to the side, which explains why this design is being adopted not just by Afeela but by traditional automakers. Ford’s version debuted on the 2024 Lincoln Nautilus luxury SUV, and BMW announced its Panoramic iDrive display for future EVs at this year’s CES.\nLike Ford and BMW, Afeela plans to offer in-vehicle video streaming and gaming — but with Sony content. You can even bring along your PlayStation controller and play Ghost of Tsushima or Gran Turismo while you wait for your car to charge.\nThe screen is the only premium-feeling thing in this nearly $90,000 car.\nThe Afeela 1 cabin also feels like it was designed around the screen. It’s the only premium-feeling thing in this nearly $90,000 car, with impressive graphics and a bezel-less design that minimizes the split between the different segments of the display. That contrasts a cabin that otherwise has no points of interest.\nThe dashboard display also has small winglets that project video from exterior cameras. Automakers like Audi have been trying to bring this tech to the U.S. for years, mainly for the aerodynamic benefit of replacing drag-inducing side mirrors with small camera pods, but have faced regulatory roadblocks. But Afeela just kept the conventional mirrors, sidestepping those issues, but also making the cameras unnecessary.\nUX is TBD Sony Honda Mobility The interior really comes alive once you start engaging with some of the features on the screen. Changing the background also changes the ambient lighting, and an audio system utilizing Sony 360 Spatial Sound Technologies produces an impressive 3D effect whether you’re listening to streaming audio or watching anime on Crunchyroll. I did a bit of both with in-car apps that didn’t require connecting a phone.\nWhat I couldn’t do was get a good sense of how well the car’s voice assistant worked because it, well, didn’t. That, along with a navigation system that refused to load, were reminders that the cars Afeela brought to CES 2025 are still prototypes.\nThis was particularly inopportune, because without any demonstration of different features or better comprehension, Afeela’s voice assistant appears similar to what’s already available from Audi , BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz . Like those features, it’s designed to help drivers access basic vehicle functions, while responding to commands in a conversant manner. Unless it proves vastly superior in production cars, this won’t be much of a distinguisher from established brands.\nDriver assist could make the difference Sony Honda Mobility It’s a similar story with the advanced driver-assistance system Sony designed for this car. This will be one of the Afeela 1’s marquee features, if for no other reason than that the screen-dominated interior could be a distracting hazard otherwise.\nThe car’s 40 sensors should at least offer good reliability. The number of sensors creates redundancy, and the mix of sensor types (radar, lidar, camera, and ultrasonic) follows the industry-standard protocol of overlapping capability to ensure there are no weak spots. It will also be interesting to see if Afeela has truly integrated its lidar, unlike Volvo, which started selling EX90 electric SUVs without activating their roof-mounted lidar units.\nThe car’s 40 sensors should at least offer good reliability, creating redundancy.\nInitially, though, Afeela only plans to offer Level 2 automation, meaning drivers can take their hands off the wheel but must keep their eyes on the road. A monitoring sensor mounted above the screen in the center of the dashboard checks for this, just as it does in the Level 2 General Motors Super Cruise and Ford Blue Cruise systems already deployed in the U.S. The goal is to move up to Level 3 — allowing for eyes-off driving in some situations — in the future.\nEven Level 3 isn’t unprecedented. Mercedes-Benz brought its Drive Pilot system to market in 2023 (albeit on a limited basis) and Honda announced its own system at CES 2025, which will go into cars built at the same factory as the Afeela. Honda developed its system independently, though, so it will be interesting to see how it compares to Sony/Afeela’s.\nWhat does this add up to? Sony Honda Mobility That Afeela is preparing to bring the sensor-studded, screen-filled EV that first appeared at CES 2023 to production is impressive. It’s just too bad that the rest of the auto industry has already caught up.\nNearly every feature of the Afeela 1 — from its screen layout, to its ability to stream videos, to its voice recognition and driver assist — is already offered or slated to be offered by existing automakers. And as a car, the Afeela 1 looks pretty ho-hum. It should be decently quick, but its estimated 300-mile range is merely adequate and its 150-kilowatt DC fast-charging power rate just isn’t good enough for a car this expensive. It’s $89,900 base price is higher than that of a Lucid Air or Tesla Model S.\nA road test could prove that the Afeela 1 is more than it seems. It could handle nicer, provide more seamless connectivity, and more capable driver-assist features than the competition. Otherwise, it may not have much to offer that customers can’t already get from other brands. The Sony name only counts for so much.\nEditors’ Recommendations Honda unveils sleek electric sedan and SUV prototypes at CES 2025 The sensor-studded Sony electric car won’t be cheap Cheapest Cybertruck now costs way more than $60,990 The Sony Honda Afeela car is peak CES, and I’m totally here for it The Sony car is real.

    "text": "TORONTO — The Los Angeles Lakers' mystique was alive and well with Ontario bettors.\nThe Lakers, led by superstar LeBron James, were the second-most bet on team on DraftKings' Ontario sportsbook last year. Only the Toronto Blue Jays drew more action.\n\"The Lakers are a popular team, whether it's the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, it doesn't matter,\" said Johnny Avello, DraftKings' director of race and sports operations. \"The team has a big following and has for many years because of all the great players that go through their doors.\n\"You go anywhere and you'll see people wearing Lakers shirts.\"\nThe Buffalo Bills -- popular in southern Ontario -- held down third spot. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the only other Canadian franchise to make the cut, standing eighth ahead of basketball's Phoenix Suns and football's New York Jets.\nThe Jays (89-73) finished third in the American League East to qualify for the playoffs. However, they were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Twins in the AL wildcard series.\nToronto was the most-bet on World Series team, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The champion Texas Rangers were fourth.\nToronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the most bet-on player to win the AL MVP, ahead of New York's Aaron Judge and Texas's Corey Seager. But Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani, the fourth pick, was the runaway winner of the award before signing a mega 10-year, US$700-million free-agent deal with the Dodgers.\nAvello wasn't surprised to see the Jays atop the list.\n\"When you look at certain jurisdictions where we are, teams in that jurisdiction are bet on more than others,\" he said. \"So that's no surprise.\"\nThe Toronto Raptors were the seventh-most bet on team to win the NBA crown. The Milwaukee Bucks, Suns and eventual-champion Denver Nuggets held the top three spots.\nNo Raptors were listed as favourites for the NBA's outstanding player award but Hamilton's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was the fourth most-bet on individual by handle. Denver's Nikola Jokic, Boston's Jayson Tatum and Dallas's Luka Doncic were the top-three picks.\nToronto's Darko Rajakovic was fourth in betting for the NBA's top coach award. Former Raptors boss Nick Nurse, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, was tops.\nLast month, Gilgeous-Alexander was named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year.\n\"He is a tremendous player and has been for a few years now,\" Avello said. \"It's not unusual that he'd be bet up there because he's certainly one of your top players in the NBA.\"\nSurprisingly, the Cincinnati Bengals were the most bet-on NFL team to win the Super Bowl. Buffalo was second ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (12-4), who've clinched top spot in the NFC.\nBuffalo (10-6) can secure the AFC East for a fourth straight year with a road win Sunday over Miami. The Dolphins (11-5) have already clinched an NFL playoff spot.\n\"I found that (Cincinnati selection) to be a little surprising,\" Avello said. 'Buffalo has always been a top choice because it has had a good, competitive team over the last few years and there's also the proximity to Canada.\n\"But the Bengals have had a good team knocking on the door so I think this was about value . . . going for a double-digit underdog and trying to get a better price for your buck. I don't blame (bettors) because going into the season I thought Cincinnati would also contend for the title but unfortunately when you lose (quarterback) Joe Burrow and a couple of receivers . . . it was just a bad overall year for Cincinnati.\"\nBuffalo quarterback Josh Allen was the third pick for the NFL's most valuable player award behind San Francisco's Brock Purdy and Dallas's Dak Prescott. Lamar Jackson, who has led Baltimore (13-3) to top spot in the AFC and emerged as the favourite to win the honour for a second time, was initially ninth.\nOntario bettors made the Maple Leafs the most bet-on team to win the Stanley Cup. Edmonton was No. 2 ahead of Las Vegas, last year's champion.\nToronto last won the Stanley Cup in 1967.\n\"Toronto has been there, it has had great, outstanding regular-season records, it just hasn't been able to get far enough,\" Avello said. \"I think it (Leafs topping list) should be.\"\nThe Vancouver Canucks were fifth, ahead of the Ottawa Senators (sixth).\nRick Tocchet, in his first full season behind Vancouver's bench, was the top selection to win the Jack Adams Trophy as the NHL's top coach. The Canucks (24-11-3, 51 points) currently top the Pacific Conference.\nPeter Laviolette of the New York Rangers (26-10-1, 53 points) and Mike Sullivan of the Pittsburgh Penguins (19-14-4, 42 points) were the other top two candidates.\n\"Obviously it makes sense that (Tocchet) would get bet,\" Avello said. \"But (Laviolette) is also a good choice and value play.\n\"That was probably bet more toward the beginning of the year so I see that also as a very smart play by bettors.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.\nDan Ralph, The Canadian Press",
