    "text": "Keep your pets safe and warm during the cold weather RAPID CITY, S.D. (KOTA) - With temperatures being unable to reach the positives, the cold is affecting more than just people. While the temperature is cold, the wind chill is making it even colder. Chief Meteorologist David Stradling says people shouldn’t spend more than about 10 minutes outside, but we shouldn’t forget about how the cold can affect our pets. “Well when it’s this cold, I’d say do it like we do it. Just don’t take them out for long walks, keep them shorter, maybe when you get back from walks wipe off their paws. You’re looking for salt and deicers, that stuff can build up and they can lick it,” Said Jerry Steinley, director at the Humane Society of the Black Hills. Along with trying to keep your animals inside as much as possible, dressing your animals in a warm sweater or putting booties on their feet can help as well. “You know, we wear our coat when we go outside, they can definitely wear a coat. You just want to make sure that it’s comfortable, not constricting for them, and that they easily wear it, and that it doesn’t cause much problems when they do wear it. Sometimes the boots can come in handy, especially if they’re going to be walking outside, and they maybe have more tender feet than other dogs. So if your dog is a little tender-footed, sometimes the booties can be helpful,” said Dr. Lorraine Corriveau, primary care veterinarian at Purdue Veterinary Hospital. If you do have a more outside dog or one that doesn’t come inside, there are some tips to keep them warm “Those guys need to be in some sort of protected environment so they’re not 100% exposed to those outside weathers. So the proper shelter for animals really should be a good house that has three sides that are enclosed, so you’ve got good barriers against the wind. You want to have it actually raised up off the floor, believe it or not, so you want to have it up off of that cold, cold surface. Then you want to have a good amount of straw or hay or some kind of insulation that’s in there for them to kind of provide some snuggling abilities that are there,” continued Dr. Corriveau. Along with making sure the outside shelter is well insulated, keeping the shelter smaller can also keep your pet warmer. If you see any animals out in the cold, Steinley says you can pull the animal into your car if it’s safe to do so, or you can call animal services and enforcement at (605) 394-4132.

    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — The cause of death was revealed for former Ohio State offensive lineman Ben Christman.\nAccording to his obituary, Christman died in his sleep from natural causes. He was found dead in an apartment near UNLV on Feb. 11, a day before his 22nd birthday.\nChristman began his college career at Ohio State as a highly ranked prospect in the 2021 recruiting class. He redshirted that season and played in one game in 2022 before transferring to Kentucky. Christman did not play in 2023 because of a knee injury but appeared in all 12 games last season on special teams.\nHe then transferred to UNLV after the 2024-25 season.\nIn a statement, UNLV head coach Dan Mullen said the team was \"heartbroken.\"\n\"Since the day Ben set foot on our campus a month ago, he made the Rebels a better program,\" Mullen said. \"Ben was an easy choice for our Leadership Committee as he had earned the immediate respect, admiration and friendship of all his teammates.\"\n“There is little that can be said to lessen the pain of suddenly losing a member of our university family at such a young age, and my heart breaks for all who knew and loved him,” UNLV President Keith Whitfield said in a statement.\n\"Those who knew Ben will remember him for his joyful spirit, kind heart and unshakeable commitment to those around him. He leaves behind a family who adored him, friends and teammates who admired him, and a community who will forever cherish the impact he made during his brief time with us,\" the obituary read in part.\nFamily members will hold a memorial service for Christman at St. Sebastian Catholic Church in Akron Friday morning.",

    "text": "[Estados](/estados) Lectura 2:00 min Jalisco genera 77% de su demanda eléctrica Por quinto año consecutivo, la entidad es líder nacional en generación distribuida. Guadalajara, Jal. Con la producción local del 77% del total de la energía que requiere el estado, Jalisco se coloca por quinto año consecutivo, como líder nacional en materia de generación distribuida, afirmó el titular de la Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico (Sedeco), Roberto Arechederra. De acuerdo con la Agencia de Energía del Estado de Jalisco (AEEJ) con información de la Comisión Reguladora de Energía, en 2018 la entidad producía 89 Megawatts (MW) mientras que, en lo que va de 2024, registra una generación de 589 MW, lo que equivale a más de 81,000 contratos de interconexión al cierre del primer semestre del año. \"Hay que destacar el papel de Jalisco como líder en la implementación de tecnologías limpias, para energía limpia y renovable. Con casi 82,000 contratos de interconexión, [Jalisco es líder nacional en sistemas de energía solar ](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Jalisco-es-lider-nacional-en-transicion-a-energias-limpias-coinciden-empresas-y-gobierno-20240909-0119.html)y es el número uno en sistemas de calentamiento solar de agua en residencias\", subrayó el titular de Sedeco. En materia de generación eléctrica, Jalisco pasó de generar el 23% de su demanda energética en 2018, a tener el 77% en el presente año. Del total, 44% corresponde a energía limpia y renovable que se traduce en 1,130 MW de capacidad adicional instalada para abastecer los requerimientos de la población. Nearshoring En el marco del Congreso de Energía Jalisco que concluye mañana viernes en Expo Guadalajara, el encargado de despacho de la Agencia de Energía, Víctor Cervantes, sostuvo que [los cambios en la política energética del gobierno federal](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/academicos-urgen-regular-disposicion-final-paneles-fotovoltaicos-jalisco-20240924-727034.html) y el incremento de la demanda por el nearshoring, \"han puesto a prueba\" la capacidad de adaptación y creatividad para esta agencia estatal. \"La regulación energética es de competencia federal; sin embargo, desde la Agencia de Energía no hemos dejado de promover la atracción de inversiones y el desarrollo energético del estado\", indicó Cervantes Verdín.",
