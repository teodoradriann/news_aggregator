    "text": "Easy Parmesan crusted chicken\nJuicy chicken breasts breaded and cooked until golden brown makes this Parmesan crusted chicken recipe the perfect easy dinner served with a simple side.\nIf your family is anything like mine, serving them anything crispy and fried is sure to be a huge hit. This crispy, easy Parmesan crusted chicken is no different. My family loves this recipe because the breading keeps the chicken breasts super juicy while adding so much color and flavor. I love it for all the same reasons but also because it takes me 20 minutes to cook, from start to finish. It is the perfect easy weeknight dinner served with a simple side dish and lemon wedges.\nIngredients and Substitutions\n- Chicken. I used chicken breasts but you can use boneless chicken thighs too. Thighs just require a little longer cooking time. Chicken tenders or cutlets can also be used.\n- Flour.\n- Eggs.\n- Breadcrumbs. Panko bread crumbs, Italian or fresh s will all work.\n- Parmesan.\n- Dried herbs. I just used a mix but parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme are all delicious. You can use Italian seasoning too.\n- Spices: Garlic powder, paprika, salt and black pepper.\n- Oil, for frying. I have used both olive oil and canola oil for frying. Avocado oil works well too.\n- Lemon wedges and fresh parsley, to serve.\nHow to make Parmesan crusted chicken\n- Slice the chicken breast in half horizontally (resulting in two thin cutlets) and prepare your breading station.\n- Whisk the eggs into a wide, shallow bowl and place the seasoned flour and panko breadcrumbs in two separate bowls. Grate the Parmesan into the bread crumbs and season with dried herbs, garlic powder, paprika, salt and black pepper.\n- Dredge the chicken cutlets first in the flour, then in the egg mixture and finally in the seasoned breadcrumb mixture. For a thicker crust, repeat the egg and breadcrumb steps.\n- Preheat a large pan or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and allow to preheat. Add 2-3 chicken cutlets to the pan then allow to cook for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through.\n- Remove from the pan and drain on paper towel or a wire rack set in a sheet pan before serving with freshly squeezed lemon juice, grated parmesan and fresh herbs like parsley.\nCan I make this ahead?\nThe chicken can be breaded and kept on a sheet pan in a single layer, loosely covered with plastic wrap for a few hours ahead of frying. Leftovers can be kept in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days and reheated in the oven or air fryer until hot and crisp. Breaded chicken can also be frozen. Bread the chicken cutlets as directed then freeze in a single layer in freezer-safe containers or bags for up to 3 months. Cook from frozen in the air fryer for 15-20 minutes.\nFAQ\nCoating the chicken (or anything you want to bread) in flour first gives the eggs and in turn the breadcrumbs something to stick to.\nAbsolutely. Breaded foods work very well in the air fryer. Add the breaded chicken cutlets to the air fryer basket and drizzle/spray with oil, then air fry at 200ºC/390ºF for 6 minutes, flip over and air fry for another 4-5 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.\nYes, you can bake breaded chicken. Pre-heat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF. Place the breaded chicken breasts onto a baking sheet then bake for 10-15 minutes, turning over half way through, until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. You can also air fry leftover chicken. Keep the chicken in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can broil the chicken for a few minutes if you want a crispier crust.\nTo reheat Parmesan crusted chicken or breaded chicken, place on a baking sheet and bake at 200ºC/400ºF for 7-10 minutes until heated through.\nServing Suggestions\nParmesan chicken is delicious served with pretty much any side dish. Mashed potatoes, salads, simple vegetables like steamed green beans or broccoli will all be delicious. It’s also great to serve a sauce or creamy sautéed mushrooms with the chicken.\nCrispy Chicken Recipes\nEasy Parmesan crusted chicken\nPin\nRate\nIngredients\n- 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts\nFor the breading\n- 1 cup flour seasoned with ½ tsp salt and pepper\n- 3 large eggs beaten and seasoned with a pinch of salt\n- 2 cups breadcrumbs (Panko, Italian or fresh)\n- 1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese\n- 2 tsp dried herb mix\n- 1 tsp garlic powder\n- ½ tsp paprika\n- 1 tsp salt\nInstructions\n- Place boneless skinless chicken breasts on a cutting board.\n- Place your non-dominant hand on the chicken then carefully slice the chicken breast in half horizontally. This creates two even, thin chicken cutlets.\n- Set the chicken aside while you prepare the breading.\n- Set out three, deep and wide bowls (big enough to comfortably bread the chicken breasts).\n- In the first one, place the flour then season with salt and pepper.\n- Whisk the eggs into the second bowl and season with salt.\n- In the last bowl, combine the bread crumbs (you can use fresh, Italian or Panko bread crumbs) and add the grated Parmesan cheese and seasonings.\n- Coat the chicken cutlets first in the flour, then in the egg and finally in the seasoned breadcrumbs.\n- To create a thicker breading, you can repeat the egg and breadcrumb step, but you might need to prepare more breadcrumbs if you plan on doing that.\n- Preheat a large pan or skillet and add 1-2cm / ½-¾ inch of canola oil (or any neutral oil with a high-smoke point).\n- Carefully add 2-3 crusted chicken breasts at a time and cook for 2-3 minutes a side until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through.\n- Remove the chicken from the pan and allow to drain on paper towel before serving with lemon wedges and extra Parmesan (optional) and a sprinkling of fresh parsley.",

    "text": "We all know this is the worst football game EA has ever made in terms of the gameplay and the number of players stopping playing is proving that at record speed, but you could fix it soooo easily.\n1. REBOUNDS, REBOUNDS, REBOUNDS. Sometimes a lucky rebound goal is fine, it happens, but this is happening 20+ times a game. First it's impossible to get the ball off your opponent as you tackle then it rebounds back to them way too frequently, secondly, terrible shot at keeper = rebound = goal, happens almost every game.\n2. AI Defending. I've just played x4 games in a row of UT Div 2, and EVERYONE is AI Defending. They don't bother controlling the nearest player to the ball when defending, they just let the AI do it then they switch to the player last minute to make a tackle if you get too close, while they run around with an attacking player to defend aimlessly as they know the AI will do all the appropriate defending for them. What SHOULD happen is that your forced to use the closest defending player to the player with the ball. It's s effing boring, i want to play against another human, not AI every time im attacking.\nFix these two things and we're back...",

    "title": "Pope Francis visits women’s prison in Rome to wash the feet of 12 inmates from his wheelchair to mark Maundy Thursday",
    "text": "Pope Francis washed the feet of 12 imprisoned women from his wheelchair to commemorate Holy Thursday. The 87-year-old pontiff, who often calls for compassion for prisoners, visited the Rebibbia women’s prison, on the northeastern outskirts of Rome, where he performed the same rite in 2015. Thursday, however, was the first time that the Argentine Jesuit dedicated his annual ritual during Holy Week solely to women. Sitting in a wheelchair, the Pope washed the feet of each of the prisoners, some of them crying, before drying them with a towel and kissing them. “We all have small failures, big failures,” the pope said in an impromptu homily during a Mass celebrated in the courtyard of the prison that houses about 370 women. “But the Lord always awaits us, with open arms, and never tires of forgiving,” he added. Pope Francis kisses the feet of an inmate from the female section of the Rebibbia prison during a Holy Thursday ritual Pope Francis washes the feet of inmates during a private visit to the prison Pope Francis smiles as he leaves after visiting the women’s section of the Rebibbia prison Washing the feet is “a gesture that draws our attention to the vocation of service,” said Francis, who as a priest in Buenos Aires had already begun visiting prisoners. A few minutes earlier, the pontiff was all smiles as he shook hands with inmates. In England, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also performed foot washing at St Paul’s Church in Maidstone, Kent. Last month, the Pope came down with the flu, forcing him to cancel some public meetings. During his subsequent recovery, he on several occasions asked others to read his speeches. In Christian tradition, Maundy Thursday commemorates the day when Christ washed the apostles’ feet at the Last Supper. It is a highlight of Holy Week, which commemorates the last days of Christ before his resurrection at Easter. Since becoming pope in 2013, the head of the Catholic Church has frequently visited prisons and refugee centers, including on Maundy Thursday last year, when he visited a youth detention center and washed the feet of 12 young people. On Good Friday he will preside over the ‘Way of the Cross’ at the Colosseum in Rome, which he could not attend last year because he was recovering from a bronchial infection. Pope Francis looked good as he began four intense days of pre-Easter events and renewed his own ordination vow. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performs the Washing of the Feet ceremony during the Sung Eucharist and Holy Thursday Liturgy at St Paul’s Church, Maidstone. The Archbishop performs the washing of the feet on Holy Thursday, the eve of Good Friday Francis, who recently reduced his speaking engagements due to fatigue related to bouts of bronchitis and influenza, read a long homily during the Holy Thursday “Chrism Mass” in St. Peter’s Basilica. He also saluted two bereaved parents whose story was told in a 2020 novel by Irish author Colum McCann. The Pope noted that there were two people in the Vatican’s Paul VI audience room – “two fathers” – one Palestinian and the other Israeli. Bassam Aramin’s daughter Abir was murdered in 2007 by an Israeli soldier as she left school; Rami Elhanan’s daughter Smadar was killed in a 1997 attack in Jerusalem. The story of the two men’s friendship was told in the novel ‘Apeirogon’ by Colum McCann, who met with Pope Francis during an audience with artists on June 23, 2023. “Let us think about the beautiful testimony of these two people who suffered the war in the Holy Land with the loss of their daughters,” the Pope said. During the service, Francis urged priests to be compassionate, admit when they have “deviated from the path of holiness” and avoid dishonesty and hypocrisy. Tomorrow he will preside over an Easter Vigil service and then, on Easter Sunday, he will read his semi-annual ‘Urbi et Orbi’ message and blessing from the central balcony of St Peter’s to tens of thousands of people in the square below.",

El acto de nombramiento ha tenido lugar en el marco del Pleno Extraordinario y Solemne que se ha celebrado este jueves, 19 de septiembre, en el Teatro Circo de Marte. El presidente insular, Sergio Rodríguez, puso de relieve la importancia de que la Corporación insular reconozca a “un actor completo, dotado de todos los recursos exigibles, desde su profunda y personalísima voz a su presencia que llenaba, con la misma dignidad, un teatro notable o un tinglado de pueblo” y destacó que, con este reconocimiento “también se premia a una persona que, a través de su esposa Pilar Rey, descubrió aquí una cantera de inmensas posibilidades para la labra del arte en todas sus vertientes: desde el teatro, que fue su ”razón de existencia“, hasta el cine que, con esfuerzos heroicos tuvo en La Palma esforzados cultivadores con bien ganada reputación exterior”, informa la institución en nota de prensa.\nRodríguez también recordó la labor editorial desarrollada por Adbo, y que dio pie a nuevos autores y rescató a los olvidados por los totalitarismos que, como una tara trágica, salpican los ambientes democráticos y los sitios grandes y pequeños.\nActo de la entrega de Hijo Adoptivo de La Palma a Antonio Abdo. Además, el presidente también puso de manifiesto la importancia de la figura de Antonio Abdo en la cultura de la Isla, con la fundación de la Escuela Municipal de Teatro de Santa Cruz de La Palma, un espacio que se ha consolidado como foco cultural con amplio reconocimiento dentro y fuera de Canarias y, para bien de todos, goza de buena salud.\nRodríguez también incidió en que, tanto Antonio como Pilar se convirtieron en protagonistas de la cultura y en embajadores de las expresiones y actividades palmeras en el exterior.\nEn el acto también intervinieron el consejero de Cultura y Patrimonio Histórico, Pablo Díaz Cobiella, que fue el instructor del expediente, así como los portavoces de los partidos políticos de Coalición Canaria, Partido Popular y PSOE, Juan Ramón Felipe, Carlos Cabrera y Borja Perdomo, respectivamente, junto a un amigo del homenajeado, Anelio Rodríguez Concepción.\nEl presidente insular y representantes de la Corporación hicieron entrega del título de Hijo Adoptivo a la sobrina de Antonio Abdo, María del Pilar Batista Rey, que también ofreció unas palabras en el evento en representación de la familia del actor.\nIntervención de Anelio Rodríguez Concepción.",
