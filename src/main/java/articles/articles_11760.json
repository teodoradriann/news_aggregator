    "text": "Space food isn’t Tang and puréed meat in a tube any longer, in fact it’s mushroom bacon and fresh strawberries that have earned a North Vancouver company the grand prize in a Canadian Space Agency and NASA challenge to make food indoors. Ecoation Innovative Solutions has won the Deep Space Food Challenge with their CanGrow Modular Food Production System, and will receive $380,000 in grant funding as the grand prize winner. Ecoation CEO Saber Miresmailli said the news was “fantastic,” but what made him feel even more proud was that his idol, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, announced the company’s victory. Hadfield was a jury co-chair with the Deep Space Food Challenge. Miresmailli said his team aims to make astronauts feel like they are dining out in a five-star restaurant with a menu that features steak substitute, a mixed salad and fresh strawberries for dessert. “Part of the challenge was to go through a series of tests to make sure that the food that you produce is not only nutritious but it’s also tasty,” said Miresmailli, adding that they aren’t just providing concepts to judges but are also a food production company. Miresmailli said they even did a blind test with judges, inviting them to taste meat made with mushroom and real meat, but they couldn’t tell the difference. A joint statement from the Canadian Space Agency and NASA said the company’s CANGrow system has the potential to sustain astronauts during long-duration missions into space, while also addressing food security in isolated communities on Earth. The challenge was launched in 2021 in collaboration with NASA. The Canadian Space Agency said in a statement that jury members highlighted the quality of the projects submitted, saying the solutions could make a real difference in the capacity to sustain long-duration missions in space. The CANGrow unit is the size of a wardrobe and operates on standard 120-volt power. It has the potential to generate over 700 kilograms of nutrient-dense food every year, including strawberries, dwarf cherry tomatoes, and the root of a fungus that becomes a meat substitute. The CANGrow system has five chambers, four equipped with LED lights to support plant growth. Its fifth chamber grows a protein-rich mushroom-forming fungi. The last thing astronauts need to be worried about is spending time growing these crops in space, said Miresmailli, who described his team as space farmers. He said the team can use artificial intelligence to remotely look after and grow the plants from Earth, adjusting temperatures and growing conditions. Miresmailli said the Canada Space Agency has been helping them throughout the three-year journey to the prize, and he’s encouraged to see the judges not only love their invention but also their food. He said the grant money will be used to “compensate” team members who have been pouring their efforts into the unit. He also hopes the technology won’t just benefit astronauts but people in Northern Canada where weather conditions aren’t always suitable for producing fresh food. This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 10, 2024. Nono Shen, The Canadian Press Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version incorrectly spelled the name of the company Ecoation.",

    "title": "These are the best quotes from players who played against Michael Jordan: \"It was almost like you're playing against God\" - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Facing Michael Jordan 's team was one of the toughest tasks in basketball, and guarding him was definitely in the same realm. Jordan is widely recognized as arguably the greatest player of all time. His ability to dominate the game and perform at an unbelievable level against any opponent is a testament to his skill, work ethic, and competitive spirit. What makes Jordan's legacy even more fascinating is the insight provided by those who had been given the daunting task of guarding him during actual games. The perspectives of MJ's former rivals offer a clearer picture of the nightmare they faced on the court while manning him. On this special list, we'll get to take a quick look at some of the best quotes from NBA players who have guarded the one and only \"His Airness.\" Former Cleveland Cavaliers guard Ehlo will never forget the night Jordan hit one of his most iconic game-winning shots in front of him. It was Game 5 of the Cavs and the Chicago Bulls Eastern Conference first-round duel in 1989, and the do-or-die game came down to one final possession. Everybody knew the ball will go to Jordan's hands and Ehlo, who gave the Cavs the lead with a nice layup in the previous possession had one thing to do: make MJ miss. Unfortunately, Jordan managed to escape Ehlo's defense and made the shot at the buzzer to lift the Bulls to a 101-100 victory. That historic Jordan highlight is now known in the NBA lore as \"The Shot.\" Here's what Ehlo had to say as he reflected on it years later: \"It looked flat. He didn't have to rush, but I just didn't think it was gonna go in 'cause it did hit some of the rim. So that's what I was thinking. But boy, when it did, then my signature moment with Gatorade and Nike and all of those is me going to the floor and Michael jumping up and down fist-pumping after he watched it go in.\" As one of the most prolific shooting guards of the 1990s, Rice faced off against Jordan on numerous occasions. While \"G Money\" was brimming with confidence in his offensive abilities, he can't say the same thing about his defense. Nevertheless, his competitive spirit and determination didn't let him shy away from the challenge of guarding the GOAT. Despite his efforts, Rice candidly acknowledged Jordan's exceptional game. He described the experience of trying to defend Mike as the same as attempting to stop a force of nature, someone with capabilities that seemed almost superhuman or some powerful entity like God almighty. \"Oh my God!, I mean, it was almost like you're playing against God, but we all know that can't happen, \" Rice once replied when asked what it was like to match up against MJ . \"And the reason why I really truly believe that Michael Jordan is the best player to ever play the game of basketball is because you'll never find a competitor who is as fierce on both ends of the floor as Michael Jordan.\" Former Milwaukee Bucks guard Redd was only a sophomore in the NBA when he was assigned to man Jordan in a game against the Washington Wizards. As a buddying NBA player, Redd would do anything his coach would ask him to but in that particular game, his confidence dissipated after seeing how MJ dismantled Ray Allen's defense. For context, Allen was already a multi-time All-Star at the time, and Jordan was already in his 40s. Left with no choice, Redd eventually took on Jordan that night, but as expected, he got torched as well. \"He [Jordan] wasn't who he was, but he was still incredible… He was cooking Ray [Allen] in DC, and George Karl says, 'Redd, get in there and guard Jordan.' I'm like, 'Ray can't guard him. What am I gonna do?'. It was my second year in the league… but MJ was tough, obviously,\" Redd once remembered . Four-year NBA veteran Jacobsen was still a student at Stanford University when he got the chance to play against Jordan. It took place in one of MJ's Flight School in Santa Barbara. Like any other college hooper, Jacobsen was in awe of the six-time champion's presence. During a pickup game, Jacobsen found himself in a one-on-one play against MJ. In his mind, he knew Jordan would destroy his defense and pull off a highlight-worthy play. However, what Casey got from Mike was more than what he had imagined: a classic savage trash-talking from his idol. \"Even though it was for only one play, I was guarding Michael Jordan,\" Jacobsen wrote in a special piece for Slam. \"My next thought to myself was, 'Don't embarrass yourself in front of your idol.'\" \"This was it. My moment. It was me versus him, one-on-one. Jordan squared me up to the basket, palming the ball in one hand like he always did. He then stopped for a second and looked at me, saying: 'You know… No white boy has ever been able to stop me before,'\" he added. Payton has become synonymous with tenacious defense and relentless competitiveness. Like many '90s NBA superstars, \"The Glove\" is remembered for his fierce rivalry with Jordan during their prime years. This intense competition reached its peak during the 1996 NBA Finals, where Payton's Seattle SuperSonics faced off against Jordan's Bulls. In the epic series, the SuperSonics found themselves in a tough spot, trailing in the series and desperate for a victory to keep their championship hopes alive. In a bold move fueled by determination, Payton took on the herculean task of guarding \"His Airness,\" utilizing every ounce of his skill and defensive prowess. Reflecting on that pivotal moment, Payton noted that he discovered some strategies that helped him wear Jordan down . However, despite his efforts, it ultimately fell short of stopping MJ and his team. \"I tried to frustrate him as much as possible. It's not easy because I knew I couldn't frustrate him; he is the greatest basketball player that ever played to me. I think what I did was tire him out. I made him work for it a little bit more. He wasn't really used to working so hard to get the basketball, and after you get the ball with about 8 or 9 seconds, you still got somebody right into you, and the referees weren't calling the calls. They were letting us play,\" the 1996 NBA Defensive Player of the Year once said of Jordan. At 5'11,\" former NBA point guard knew well that Jordan would have his way against him on the court. However, unlike other taller guards, \"Wonderdog\" took pride in not being insulted by \"His Airness\" despite their huge height and size difference when they happened to go toe-to-toe at one point. Looking back, Brooks confided that even though MJ didn't overpower him back then, he knew that it didn't mean Jordan couldn't. He just didn't choose to. \"The greatest thing is, he knew he could do whatever he wanted to do, but he just made a simple pass to the next guy over. He didn't even try to score on me,\" Scott once recalled of facing Jordan . \"So that's my claim to fame. He never trash-talked me, but I don't think I was ever a concern for him. I don't think I could ever get under his skin anyway. Why would he ever want to trash-talk me? He probably felt sorry for me.\" Former Philadelphia 76ers guard Hawkins had his fair share of on-court clashes with Jordan. He wasn't really known for his defense, but during his All-Star year in 1991, \"Hawk\" averaged a career-best 2.2 steals per game. That said, Hawkins felt like he could somehow give MJ some problems in their matchups. On top of that, Hersey also liked coming up with strategies specifically designed for his respective matchups. While that sounded impressive, Hawkins said none of that worked against Mike and years have passed since they last met on NBA hardwood but \"Hawk\" never managed to figure out Jordan's game. \"I guess when you have a game plan against certain players and when you're guarding them, you know certain things you could take away from them. Certain guys post up, and you know that if I push him this way, it'll make it more difficult for him. For some reason, (Jordan) just had such great fundamentals and footwork that you weren't able to take a lot of things away from him,\" Hersey once reflected . Legler played for several teams during his tenure as an NBA player. With a career that spanned from 1989 to 2000, Legs became familiar with his matchups' style of play, strengths, and weaknesses. That included Jordan. As per Legler, his firsthand experiences guarding Jordan would be his basis for hailing the former Bulls superstar as the rightful GOAT. \"This is the greatest player of all time. Now, obviously, with all these years later, 30+ years later, people want to make that into a debate. It still isn't for me,\" Legler once said of Jordan. \"I guarded him a lot. I guarded those teams a lot. I know what that looked like. For me, it was that. It was what he did as a basketball player, and he's the only guy I played against in my life that never took his foot off the gas.\" Ex-Orlando Magic shooting guard Anderson faced an impressive lineup of legendary twos throughout his NBA career. Among the formidable players he had the opportunity to guard were the likes of Reggie Miller and Jordan. For Nick, both Miller and Jordan were exceptional on the court, and both were known for their vicious trash-talking. However, Anderson candidly shared that it was MJ who proved to be the more challenging opponent to defend. Jordan's unique ability to score and his relentless competitiveness left a lasting impression on Anderson. In fact, Nick was in awe of how Mike beat his opponents, including him, in various ways all the time. \"You didn't want none of that smoke. Mike could beat you in multiple ways. Post up, mid range game, knocking down a three and with all due respect, Reggie [Miller] when he got it going. He's talking smack, chasing the guy off of four or five screens. You got Rik Smits, Dale Davis, and Antonio Davis setting screens, and Derrick McKee coming off those screens, and Mark Jackson hitting shots coming off those screens. Then, when he was hitting the shots, he started chirping, but Reggie did not post up a lot. Reggie did not shoot the mid-range as much as MJ [Michael Jordan],\" Anderson once said . During their prime, Hill and Jordan delighted NBA fans with their thrilling matchups. These two athletes were both known for their exceptional talent, explosiveness, and athleticism. That said, every Hill vs. Jordan showdown left everybody on the edge of their seats. Fast forward to 2001, Jordan, who was already approaching his 40s, made a highly anticipated return to the NBA. On the other hand, Hill held onto the hope that they would once again engage in an exhilarating duel that would showcase their talents once he and Jordan met again. However, to Grant's surprise, the matchup did not unfold as he had envisioned. Despite his age, Mike proved that he was still a force to be reckoned with. His performance against Grant was nothing short of remarkable, leaving the All-Star forward in disbelief at his former rival's enduring prowess. In a stunning display of skill and dominance, Jordan outshined Hill for an entire quarter by executing the same move repeatedly. The experience was both humbling and eye-opening for G-Hill, who realized that even in the twilight of his career, Jordan is Jordan. \"So we're playing Wizards, and it's a TNT game, and he torched me in that first quarter; he literally gave me 20 points in the first quarter on the same play. He just ran the same play,\" the Hall of Fame forward once recalled. \"… I had surgery a couple of days later, but I wanted to guard Jordan one last time, and I shouldn't have.\" Indiana Pacers icon is renowned for his fierce competitive spirit, earning him a prominent place in NBA history as one of Jordan's toughest rivals. \"Uncle Reg\" was exactly the same whenever he crossed paths with MJ's touted successor Kobe Bryant. Throughout his illustrious career, Miller displayed his remarkable scoring prowess in his intense matchups with both dominant shooting guards. While many were convinced that Kobe was the closest thing to Jordan, Reggie argued that for him, the famous comparison wasn't even close. In a candid admission, Miller stated that if he were to choose the better and tougher rival between Jordan and Bryant, he would unequivocally assert that \"His Airness\" presented the greater challenge. Moreover, Miller pointed out that his answer was pure fact and not even up for debate. \"Michael Jordan on his worst day is 10 times better than Kobe Bryant on his best day, and that is not short-changing Kobe Bryant because he gave me my lunchpail, too. But I will take that Black Cat all day, any day, over Kobe. Michael Jordan on his worst day I will take over Kobe Bryant on his best day,\" Miller once stressed . Related: \"I don't believe the best team won\" — Danny Ainge's controversial take on the 1993 NBA Finals between the Bulls and Suns The late NBA royalty was only 18 years old when he took on Jordan in a game for the first time. This moment was not just a game as it was a rite of passage for the young player known for his brashness and fearless approach to competition. Unlike many who might have felt daunted by the assignment of facing a player with such a remarkable legacy, Kobe was filled with excitement and eager to embrace the challenge ahead of him. However, as the game unfolded, it became more and more apparent that while many often noted the similarities between Kobe and Jordan, there was still a significant gap in experience and skill. The seasoned MJ, with his years of mastery in the league, demonstrated a level of play that ultimately outmatched the rookie Bryant. \"That moterf***er spun so fast baseline, I had no idea what happened. He was dunking the ball before I knew what the hell happened. I was 18, and I was like, 'Oh sh*t, that was pretty f**king cool,'\" the five-time NBA champion once said of his first game against Jordan. Because of Jordan's undeniable skills, many fans and analysts pondered the question: who could possibly stop him on the court? This question became so prominent that even MJ himself was once asked to truthfully answer it. In a fascinating reflection, the five-time NBA league MVP revealed had an idea about how he could effectively guard himself in a game. According to Jordan, if he were to play defense against his own game, he might rely and focus on forcing himself to take jump shots rather than allowing himself easy access to the basket. Though he wasn't sure if the said defensive tactic against himself would work, MJ believed it could somehow potentially limit his scoring opportunities, perhaps significantly reduce the number of points he might score. Jordan's genuine and unexpected answer not only speaks volumes about how he sees himself as a player but also gives fans a hint at what his rivals should've done against him. \"I'd made him shoot the jump shot,\" Jordan once said of guarding himself . \"Even though, when he drives, he penetrates, he involves a lot of other people. If he stands out and shoots the jump shot, you only got one person to worry about and I don't think he can score 100 points, I don't think.\" Hearing what these legendary players had to say about their experiences taking on Jordan certainly adds depth to MJ's legacy and appreciation of his greatness. Their stories reveal the respect they had for his talent, mentality, game and character as a player. Indeed, Jordan had encountered a wide array of NBA greats throughout his Hall of Fame NBA career. But despite their skills and determination, none of them ever found a definitive solution to stop or defeat him on the court. This reality underscores the fact that \"His Airness\" was not only exceptionally talented but had also consistently managed to stay a step ahead of his competition. Moreover, his impeccable work ethic, strategic thinking, and ability to adapt made him arguably the most desirable teammate and the most challenging matchup to his rivals. In conclusion, Jordan's legacy is a testament to his relentless pursuit of greatness which was defined not only by his talent but by his hunger to always dominate and outsmart anybody put in front of him.

    "title": "Trump Makes a PITIFULLY IMPOTENT Attempt to Drive a Wedge Between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden",
    "text": "The desperation in Donald Trump has been oozing out of every pore in his corpulent body ever since Kamala Harris became his opponent for the presidency. Trump was primed to run against Joe Biden with a barrel full of age-related assaults that he must now discard. He never had a substantive argument against Biden or a truthful one for himself. Click here to Tweet this article Consequently, Trump is now left with nothing but his babbling diversions about Hannibal Lecter and his hostile and tiresome taunts at the press. He spent his recent cult rally in North Carolina - where he promised to focus on economic issues - flailing wildly with infantile insults at both Biden and Harris, whom he is now trailing in most polls. SEE THIS: Trump is Losing to Kamala Harris, Who He Says is Dumb, Low IQ – What Does that Say About Trump? On Thursday morning Trump took to his floundering social media scam, Truth Social, to resume his barrage of incoherent blather aimed at Harris and Biden. In a psychotic rant Trump alleged that there is some sort of division between the President and the Vice-President. Of Course, it is another figment cooked up in his perversely warped imagination. He wrote that... \"Kamala Harris wants NOTHING TO DO WITH CROOKED JOE BIDEN. They are throwing him out on the Monday Night Stage, known as Death Valley. He now HATES Obama and Crazy Nancy more than he hates me! He is an angry man, as he should be. They stole the Presidency from him — 'It was a Coup!'\" First of all, any assessment by Trump of what is going on in the personal lives of Democrats must be taken with a shipload of salt. That's especially true of his musings about the upcoming Democratic National Convention (DNC). He obviously has no sources or insights into internal Democratic affairs. For the record, Harris has scheduled Biden to speak on day one of the DNC during a celebration of the President she has served loyally for three and half years. It will be a tribute at a time reserved for honors. By comparison, here are the people that Trump scheduled at the RNC for what he calls \"Death Valley\": Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Sen. Ron Johnson, Sen. Tim Scott, Virginia, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. They will surely be thrilled to find out just how lowly he regards them by having scheduled them there.. To make matters worse for Trump, Harris and Biden made their first public appearance together since the passing of the torch on the same Thursday morning. And Harris was not shy about expressing her admiration and appreciation for her boss. She introduced him saying that \"I could speak all afternoon about the person that I am standing on the stage with. [Extended ovation] Our extraordinary President Joe Biden.\" And the feelings were mutual. In his remarks Biden praised Harris as \"an incredible partner...She's gonna make one hell of a president.\" But he also found time to taunt Trump as \"The guy we're running against...what’s his name? Donald Dump?\" Dotard J. Trump thinks Joe Biden hates Kamala Harris. I think he's mistaken...LEFT: \"The guy we're running against...what’s his name? Donald Dump?\"RIGHT: \"I have an incredible partner...She's gonna make one hell of a president.\"pic.twitter.com/ORneaxOcbXpic.twitter.com/kDIPod8rQr— News Corpse (@NewsCorpse) August 15, 2024 Dotard J. Trump thinks Joe Biden hates Kamala Harris. I think he's mistaken...LEFT: \"The guy we're running against...what’s his name? Donald Dump?\"RIGHT: \"I have an incredible partner...She's gonna make one hell of a president.\"pic.twitter.com/ORneaxOcbXpic.twitter.com/kDIPod8rQr Trump's characterization of Biden as hating Harris and Obama and Pelosi is just more evidence of his acute derangement, which is getting worse by the hour. Meanwhile, both Harris and Biden are campaigning in an environment of joyfulness that the nation finds endearing and a great relief from the animus of Trump & Co. Plus, like much of the English language, Trump is proving that he doesn't have the slightest idea what the word “coup\" means. It was Biden who chose to step aside and endorse Harris. And it looks like it was another brilliant decision on Biden's part. Trump is the coup plotter - and the convicted felon - and the sexual abuser - and the financial fraudster - and the serial adulterer - and the wannabe dictator. And for some gawdfersaken reason, he is also the choice of the Republican Party to be their standard bearer and lead them to another humiliating defeat in November. Let's wish them all the best in that pursuit. RELATED STORIES: Be sure to visit and follow News Corpse on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and Threads.
