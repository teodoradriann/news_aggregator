    "title": "Ark Invest: Bitcoin Bull Run 'In The Early To Middle Stages' By Benzinga",
    "text": "Benzinga - Ark Invest, known for its bullish bets on disruptive innovation, says in a new report that Bitcoin‘s (CRYPTO: BTC) recent price consolidation does not signal a bear market, but rather a healthy correction within a bull run. What Happened: The report dives into various on-chain metrics to assess Bitcoin’s health. Ark Invest highlights that while Bitcoin’s price appreciated by 16.5% in March to $71,288, some long-term holders have been taking profits. However, according to Ark, this profit-taking is balanced by new investors entering the market, as evidenced by record inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Market Indicators Show Bull Run Is In ‘Early To Mid Stages’ The report indicates that Bitcoin’s March closing price of $71,288 represents a 16.5% increase within the month and a notable 68.6% rise in the first quarter of the year. One of the key metrics highlighted is the MVRV Z-Score, which is used to assess whether Bitcoin is over or undervalued relative to its “realized” value. “Compared to past cycles, its MVRV Z-Score suggests that Bitcoin’s price is in the early to mid stages of a bull market,” the report states, suggesting considerable growth ahead before reaching overbought conditions. Ark Invest elaborates on the significance of this metric: “MVRV Z-Score measures the difference between Bitcoin’s market cap and realized cap… and gauges the stage of the market relative to its mean in terms of standard deviations. Currently, the measures are below the thresholds that typically indicate peak valuations.” Also Read: [Ethereum: A Deflationary Store of Value with Dividend Payouts?] Spot Bitcoin ETFs And Profit-Taking Dynamics The report also sheds light on the behavior of Bitcoin spot ETFs and long-term holders. In March, total assets under management (AUM) in spot Bitcoin ETFs surged to $59.1 billion, reflecting a 21.8% increase from February. Interestingly, inflows and outflows for these ETFs have nearly balanced, indicating a stable but cautious investor sentiment. Despite the bullish signals, the document notes that some long-term Bitcoin holders have begun taking profits, a move seen typically in high-volatility bull markets. “Based on a six-month horizon, net outflows in ‘supply last moved one year ago or more' increased during the first quarter,” Ark reports, adding that this behavior aligns with previous bull market phases. Fiat Depreciation And Global Economic Weakness Adding to the complex financial landscape, Ark’s analysis includes observations on global fiat currencies, notably the Egyptian pound and Nigerian naira, which have depreciated significantly. This trend underscores broader economic difficulties, including challenges in GDP and GDI metrics that could impact market sentiment and pricing power worldwide. Implications for Investors And The Upcoming Benzinga Conference As Bitcoin continues to digest significant profit-taking while consolidating at all-time highs, Ark’s findings will be a key topic of discussion at the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 19. The conference will delve into the implications of such market behaviors and the strategic responses by institutional and retail investors alike.

    "text": "October 10, 2024\nBy Matthew Olay, DOD News\nDOD, FEMA Working in Unison on Hurricane Relief Efforts\nThe Defense Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are fully engaged in a whole-of-government effort to provide relief to victims of both Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, the Pentagon announced today.\nThe efforts include thousands of DOD personnel, vehicles and equipment providing relief on the ground in the affected states of Florida and North Carolina, as well as executive-level coordination in the nation's capital.\nIn Florida, more than 6,500 National Guardsmen, 26 helicopters, over 500 high-water vehicles and just over a dozen watercraft from 12 separate states are mobilized to participate in a response and recovery mission following the damage inflicted by Hurricane Milton, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told the media.\nRyder added that approximately 250 people are providing support with debris control, temporary roof support, waterway clearance, flood control and more.\nOther relief efforts include U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Army North having active duty forces and capabilities from multiple military installations throughout the region standing by to support FEMA when requested, Ryder said.\nDOD also took precautions to evacuate some military facilities ahead of the hurricane's arrival, including U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.\n\"As you know, Hurricane Milton impacted Florida as a Category 3 storm, and DOD took appropriate precautions in advance for our facilities in Florida to ensure the safety of our personnel, their families and equipment,\" Ryder said, adding that both commands continue to operate out of multiple alternative locations and that those who evacuated will be able to return to MacDill once it's safe.\n\"The priority is the safety of personnel and their families and ensuring they have the resources they need as they recover from Hurricane Milton,\" Ryder said.\nIn turning to relief efforts in the Hurricane Helene-affected state of North Carolina, Ryder said the Federal Government's combined relief efforts are ongoing.\n\"The National Guard has approximately 5,000 guardsmen, 80 high-water vehicles and 50 helicopters from 17 states mobilized. More than 1,500 active duty members are deployed to North Carolina as well, working with federal, state and local partners on the coordinated response effort,\" Ryder said.\nThose active duty personnel have been engaged in road clearing and the distribution of food, water and other commodities.\nRyder added, \"In addition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has more than 550 personnel mobilized to 14 emergency operations centers across the region; supporting debris control, temporary power infrastructure assessment, flood control and safe waterways assessment.\"\nMeanwhile in Washington, Ryder said Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III has been receiving daily updates on the response efforts and that he held meetings yesterday and today with several high-level Defense Department officials.\nMeeting attendees included Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Navy Adm. Christopher W. Grady, Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot Northcom commander and other senior officials, Ryder said.\nAdditionally, Ryder said Austin, Hicks and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., attended President Joe Biden's meeting at the White House today with Vice President Kamala Harris and other senior government officials to discuss the relief efforts.\n\"The department will continue to work closely with our federal, state and local partners to ensure we are doing everything we can to support and coordinate the ongoing disaster response efforts to aid our fellow Americans impacted by these devastating storms,\" Ryder said, adding that DOD will continue to keep the media updated on additional DOD relief efforts for both hurricanes.\nNEWSLETTER\n|\nJoin the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list |\n|\n|",

    "text": "Philanthropist Delores Barr Weaver received The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida’s Prize for Civic Engagement as part of the organization’s 60th anniversary celebration. “I often say that it’s the nonprofits who make it possible for me to play a part in building a better community. So, to all who are involved in their work– whether as a volunteer, a board member or supporter – thank you for all you do,” Weaver said in an April 19 news release from the foundation. The Community Foundation created The Prize for Civic Engagement in 2006 to recognize people in Northeast Florida who possess qualities that are not often publicly acclaimed and advance actions that enhance the public good, especially when those actions are unpopular, the release said. “It takes many types of assets – social, moral, reputational, intellectual, and financial capital – to build the better community we all want to see. Delores has led the way in showing us the good we can do when we put all our resources to work to take on the issues that matter,” Isaiah Oliver, president of The Community Foundation, said in the release. The foundation said examples include: • Weaver’s leadership at the Jaguars Foundation on the Straight Talk program, a media and grantmaking initiative that addressed teen pregnancy and reproductive health. • Creation of the Connectable campaign to recognize the talents of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. • Being an ally to LGBTQ people through support for JASMYN and the LGBTQ Community Fund at The Community Foundation. • Her commitment to women and girls, such as jump-starting the Delores Barr Weaver Policy Center. • Addressing sexual violence in the military. • Co-founding the Women’s Giving Alliance. Originally from Columbus, Georgia, Barr Weaver's legacy of philanthropy in Northeast Florida began when she moved to the area as co-owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1993. She established the Delores Barr Weaver Legacy Fund with a $50 million gift in 2012. She has since partnered with The Community Foundation through numerous, multimillion-dollar gifts, including the foundation’s largest-ever of $61 million in June 2023. Weaver established permanent endowments for more than four dozen nonprofits, including 20 that receive ongoing annual support through the Delores Barr Weaver Forever Event Fund. To date, her grantmaking exceeds $209 million, with support for more than 300 organizations in Northeast Florida and beyond. The prize has been awarded only twice before, to William E. “Bill” Scheu, a past chair of The Community Foundation’s board of trustees, in 2014; and Bill Brinton, also a past chair and founder of Scenic Jacksonville, in 2007.",

    "title": "Smart Ass Cripple: Fixing Our Broken System of Long-Term Care",
    "text": "Library of Congress\nI have a very strong reaction to advertisements for investment products. The bedrock message of these ads is that you can’t count on anyone else to take care of you, so you’d better take steps now to ensure that you have a financially secure retirement. And the best way to do that is to purchase the annuity or whatever other product the ad is selling. The answer to financial instability down the road is capitalism.\nI see it as a stressful treadmill game the vast majority of us won’t win. If we can’t count on each other to bring about a secure retirement for everyone—through public programs like Social Security—then we’re screwed.\nI have the same strong reaction when I hear about the soaring\ncost of long-term care. This subject is of particular interest to me because I’m a daily consumer of that care. I use a power wheelchair to get around all day, every day. Every morning and night, someone comes to my home to assist me with all of the daily tasks I can’t do for myself.\nI’ve hired several people to help me. I call them my pit crew, and they are paid an hourly wage. I could never afford to pay them on my own, but that’s OK, because a\nstate program largely funded by Medicaid pays their wages.\nI’d bet that all of us, or at least someone we love, will eventually need some form of assistance with navigating our homes and communities for a prolonged or indefinite period of time. But when we think about how we would pay for that help, it feels hopelessly daunting. So we shrug and move on and hope it never happens to us.\nIf it feels dismaying, that’s because it is, particularly when viewed through the lens of capitalism. It’s laughable to believe that many of us could even think about saving enough to cover the cost of long-term care. We feel abandoned because that’s the position capitalism puts us in. The glorious free market can’t figure out a way to address this need that doesn’t exploit the hell out of those who receive and provide long-term care.\nThe answer is socialism and creativity.\nWhen I say socialism, I mean making an unwavering societal commitment to the ideals of fairness. In this case, the ideal is that everyone in need of home and community assistance must get it swiftly and at no cost. They must be able to hire anyone they want to help them, including family members. And those providing the assistance must be paid a living wage and receive benefits.\nWhen I say creativity, I mean making an unwavering societal commitment to turning that ideal into a reality, by any means necessary.\nIn other words, no one who needs this kind of assistance should ever be made to feel like a burden. Because, too often, that’s the way it is now.\nIf you need assistance, like I do, and you can’t turn to the public, then you turn to your family. But it’s impossible not to feel like you’re imposing on them and holding them back. Family members likely feel obliged to help you for free. And because they are helping you for free, you feel as if you have little control over your life. You feel as if you have to accept whatever help they provide because you have no choice. Who else would do it for free?\nPaying my workers a decent wage makes a big difference. First of all, their labor is worth something. It’s important. And it’s worth a lot more than they’re currently paid.\nAlso, paying them means there’s something in it for both of us. I need their help and they need an income. We both have negotiating leverage. If they don’t do a good job or they want to move on, I’ll look for someone else.\nRelying on family for help assumes that a person has a family that’s willing and able to help in the first place. I come from a loving and supportive family, but they’re all dead. Even if they weren’t, they’d be too old to help me much in this regard.\nIt’s laughable to believe that many of us could even think about saving enough to cover the cost of long-term care. We feel abandoned because that’s the position capitalism puts us in.\nIf you don’t have a family that’s willing and able to help you for free, capitalism offers the dreadful alternative of banishment to nursing homes, which often are highly profitable private businesses. The more they can lower their expenses, the larger their potential profits. That’s why they\npay their workers so poorly and feed their residents a lot of Creamette.\nThe costs of even entering a nursing home add insult to injury. According to the insurance company\nGenworth, the national median monthly cost in 2021 for a semiprivate room in a nursing home was $7,908. People have to figure out how to pay for that. A family might have to liquidate financial assets to pay for the nursing home until they are impoverished deeply enough to qualify for public programs like Medicaid.\nNo wonder family members feel obliged to care for their loved ones for free, for hours on end. They see themselves as the only thing standing in the way of their loved one having no option but to surrender to a miserable existence in a nursing home.\nWatching family members struggle so much physically, emotionally, and financially magnifies the guilty feelings the person receiving assistance experiences. It makes them feel like even more of a burden.\nI get the help I need because my state, Illinois, has a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver. This means that Illinois has received permission from the federal government to spend Medicaid funds in a manner that enables disabled people like me to hire folks to assist us at home.\nAccording to Medicaid’s website, HCBS waivers are designed to “meet the needs of people who prefer to get long-term care services and support in their home or community, rather than in an institutional setting.”\nAnd\naccording to AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons), 77 percent of adults fifty and older prefer to “age in place.” I’m amazed that number is so low. I thought it would be at least 99.9999999999 percent. Why would anyone prefer to move into a stinkin’ nursing home?\nAnyway,\nMedicaid’s website also notes that in 2009, nearly one million people were receiving services under HCBS waivers, and there are currently 257 active waiver programs operating in nearly every state and in the District of Columbia.\nThe broad concept behind waivers is a good one to build upon, but some details make them very flawed. Thus, a whole lot of disabled people who need and desire HCBS assistance still can’t get it.\nFor instance, Medicaid says that HCBS waiver programs must “demonstrate that providing waiver services won’t cost more than providing these services in an institution.” Imposing this requirement on states that want to implement HCBS programs implies that it’s OK to incarcerate disabled people in nursing homes if it costs the government less money. That’s wrong. This should be a matter of rights, not of fiscal considerations.\nNursing homes and other institutions don’t have to live up to the same standard. They can receive Medicaid money to help cover the cost of serving their disabled residents, whether it’s cheaper or not.\nAnd the idea of waivers is itself flawed. States have to get permission from the feds to deviate from the norm if they want to use Medicaid funds to pay for HCBS. HCBS should be the rule, and institutionalization the exception. The system is currently rigged.\nLawmakers have\nintroduced federal legislation to address this problem, called the HCBS Access Act. The main change it would make is to require states to fund HCBS programs for Medicaid-eligible residents who prefer them, rather than having to apply for waivers.\nIn a brief summary of the bill, its sponsor, Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania,\nwrote that if disabled people and older adults “want to remain in their homes with help of Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS), they are often put on a waiting list and can wait years or even decades for services and supports. Medicaid policy has always paid for nursing homes and other institutional care . . . but will not pay for home and community-based services unless a waiver has been granted. This bill would put both options on equal footing and give families an equal choice.”\nIf passed, the bill would help a lot. But it would still leave people behind, because it would continue to tie HCBS eligibility to Medicaid eligibility. That means disabled people and their families may still have to impoverish themselves to be poor enough to qualify for Medicaid before they can qualify for publicly funded care assistance.\nWe still have a lot of work to do to live up to the ideal that everyone in need of home and community assistance must be able to get it—swiftly and for free.",

    "text": "MARITIME UNION OF AUSTRALIA MEDIA RELEASE GOVERNMENT'S SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS FOR OFFSHORE WORKERS WELCOMED BY UNION 16 FEBRUARY 2024 The Maritime Union of Australia has welcomed new legislation introduced to Parliament this week by Resources Minister Madeleine King that will deliver important safety improvements for maritime and offshore workers in the oil and gas sector. The offshore oil and gas sector is one of the highest-risk industries anywhere in Australia. Workers perform dangerous tasks in remote and isolated areas amongst significant physical and psychological hazards. Despite these realities, Australian offshore workers have the least health and safety rights and protections of any group of workers anywhere in the country. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2024 makes significant progress towards closing that gap and providing stronger protections. It will: - Strengthen the role and training of Health and Safety Representatives; - Allow Health and Safety Representatives to request a review of safety management documents; - Improve worker protection against discrimination and coercion; - Strengthen the mental health protections for offshore oil and gas workers; - Improve health and safety rules for diving operations and dive vessels; and - Strengthen and simplify reporting requirements for serious injury notifications. The MUA's National Safety and Training Officer, Justin Timmins, acknowledge these first steps towards bolstering safety standards for oil and gas workers on offshore sites. \"The harmonisation of offshore petroleum safety standards with national safety legislation that the Government has committed to is the next obvious priority and we look forward to contributing our knowledge and experience to this reform process,\" Mr Timmins said. The MUA's National Assistant Secretary, Adrian Evans, highlighted the ideological attacks on offshore workers that led to the regulatory and legislative failures this Bill begins to address. \"John Howard removed the application of maritime safety legislation to floating petroleum facilities (FPSOs) in 2003, in an attempt to get rid of MUA members and their maritime expertise. The Northern Endeavour was one of these facilities, and it was only four years old at the time. Lacking strong maritime regulation and expertise on board it became a rust bucket. It was shut down a few years ago when a worker was almost killed and now the Australian taxpayer is stuck cleaning up the mess,\" Mr Evans said. \"The new legislation introduced this week begins the task of addressing these decades-long problems, but we are keen to see further reform and the restoration of maritime standards on floating petroleum facilities,\" Evans added. \"Every other floating petroleum facility in the world that has the ability to voyage as a ship has to comply with global maritime safety and crewing standards. The MUA's position is that FPSOs in Australia are no different, and we look forward to working with the government to close this safety gap,\" Mr Evans said.
