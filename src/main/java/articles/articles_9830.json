    "text": "Maryland Weather: Spot shower Friday then wonderful weekend!\nMaryland Weather: Spot shower Friday then wonderful weekend!\nAfter a tough stretch of weather, Baltimore is in for a nice and quiet stretch of weather. Friday may see a spot shower, but the weekend is expected to be dry and cool, with a mix of sunshine and clouds. The evening will be nice, dry, and comfortable, with seasonably chilly weather overnight.\nWeekend Forecast\nBoth Saturday and Sunday are expected to have highs in the upper 40s to near 50, with gusty winds on Saturday making temperatures feel like the 30s. Despite the chilly weather, the weekend is set to end 2023 in style with pleasant conditions for outdoor activities.\nQUIET NIGHT AHEAD: These low temperatures are typically where our average highs should be, so I hesitate to use the word cold. It’s a chill in the air, but nothing we can’t handle. The night looks dry with partial clearing. Easy start to our Friday! @WJZ pic.twitter.com/PYHvUtf5k9\n— Steven Sosna (@SteveSosnaWX) December 28, 2023",

    "title": "Things Grounded 2 Does Better Than The First Game",
    "text": "Summary\n- UI improvements in Grounded 2 include a cleaner look and the option to switch between first-person and third-person modes.\n- The game's design is more vibrant and detailed in Grounded 2, making the map easier to understand and enhancing the Ranger Outposts.\n- The Omni-Tool in Grounded 2 streamlines gameplay with versatile functions, while gear customization options allow players to stand out.\nObsidian Entertainment has been one of the biggest RPG developers in the industry since their big hit, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords, in 2004. RPGs quickly became their bread and butter with minimal deviation. Then the pandemic hit, and everyone was stuck inside in 2020, so in July of that year, they released an Early Access version of one of their most ambitious and strange games yet, Grounded.\nRelated\n7 Things to Do First in Grounded 2\nThe sheer amount of things to do in Grounded 2 can get overwhelming for players, resulting in confusion about what needs to be done first.\nThanks to player feedback, Obsidian Entertainment released Grounded in its full version in 2022 and also launched iton more than Xbox platforms. Now, Grounded 2 is here, and already, there are numerous notable improvements from the first game. That doesn’t mean it’s perfect yet, but these are some of the greatest changes made so far.\n7 The UI\nA Cleaner Look\nThe first game had a UI design that was reminiscent of Minecraft. Players could pick up things like candy bars or rocks, and then they would appear at the bottom of the screen in the player’s inventory. It was not a bad UI system for a game with crafting, but the design in Grounded 2 is much cleaner.\nFor console players, it can still be rough navigating between all the shortcut menus, from crafting furniture to gear to equipping weapons in Grounded 2. That comes with the territory, though, as there are so many mechanics to keep track of. Overall, every menu looks much better in Grounded 2, and a lot of it has been conveniently streamlined to make the experience smoother.\n6 Third-Person Appears\nSwitch Anytime\nObsidian Entertainment seemingly unlocked the key to making third-person games this year. Both The Outer Worlds and Grounded are only playable in first-person, but their two sequels are getting third-person support. It’s great to see the faces of the kid heroes in Grounded 2 as players explore now, but there is a caveat to that.\nRelated\nHow to Build Bases in Grounded 2\nHere's how players can build their base in Grounded 2 to place all their resources, loot, and machinery, like a workbench, in a safe location.\nIt’s still easier to fight and pick up items in first-person, which is true of most RPGs that are built primarily with first-person in mind. Still, it’s great that players can go into the menu and switch to third-person anytime they want.\n5 The Design\nLess Dark, More Vibrant\nGoing back to the current version of Grounded after playing Grounded 2 is a bit astounding. The game launched out of Early Access in 2022, and yet somehow, three years later, Obsidian Entertainment has improved its tech so much.\nSide by side, there is a significant difference graphically as everything is more colorful and vibrant in the sequel. The garden in the first game, while large, is darker and a bit more drab. Even though the backyard is still a scary place filled with bugs, it is a more inviting place to jump into in Grounded 2.\n4 The Map\nTerrain That Is Easier To Understand\nThe map has also been improved in Grounded 2 thanks to the UI and graphics upgrade. In the first game, it was hard to tell where anything was while exploring. The map in Grounded 2 has more detail, allowing players to connect what they see in the world with what they see on the map.\nThere’s still a lot of guesswork for some of the exploration options, as it isn’t as detailed as something recent like Donkey Kong Country Bananza, which took map-making to a whole new level. That said, Grounded 2’s map is still an improvement over its predecessor, without a doubt.\n3 The Ranger Outpost\nFallout Says Hello\nAnother design detail that has improved is the Ranger Outposts that players can find for respite. Players will begin in a massive tower that overlooks the backyard, and they won’t find anything quite that large or unique again. However, the Ranger Outposts are now more detailed and feel like little mini Vaults from the Fallout series.\nSince Obsidian Entertainment worked on Fallout: New Vegas, it’s easy to see how they came up with the Ranger Outposts designs this time around. In the original, these shelters were very basic, like the first one players encounter in Grounded, which was no better than a gazebo with some computers in it. In Gounded 2, they feel far move lived-in and a part of the world.\n2 The Omni-Tool\nA Tool For Every Occasion\nIn the first game, one of the first things Grounded wants players to craft is a stone axe to start cutting down plants, such as trees. In the sequel, players are given the Omni-Tool almost immediately in Grounded 2. This handy tool can chop things down infinitely and be upgraded to do other things, like repair items or dig holes.\nRelated\nHow to Cook in Grounded 2\nFood in Grounded 2 needs to be cooked to make it safe to eat; here's how to cook raw food to make it safe to eat.\nThe Omni-Tool can be upgraded to increase its strength and can then cut through bigger materials. While players still have to craft a lot of gear, like weapons and armor, in Grounded 2, it is great to have a set of other tools they don’t have to think about crafting all contained in one handy-dandy unit.\n1 Gear Makes Your Characters Pop\nCustomize To Your Liking\nUnfortunately, there are no typical RPG character customization options when players choose their kids at the beginning of Grounded 2. Players can at least craft a wide range of armor and weapons to make their chosen character stand out more.\nOverall, the designs of the gear have been improved and feature a lot more detail than in the original game. It can still look awkward to wear leaves and bug carcasses as armor, but Monster Hunter fans have gotten used to this type of gear crafting for decades now. In Grounded 2, players will likely be happy with what they have.\nGrounded 2\n- Released\n- 2025-07\n- ESRB\n- Teen / Violence, Blood\n- Developer(s)\n-\nObsidian Entertainment - Publisher(s)\n- Xbox Game Studios\n- Engine\n- Unreal Engine 5\n- Multiplayer\n- Online Co-Op\n- Prequel(s)\n- Grounded\n- Number of Players\n- Single-player",

    "text": "Liverpool toma susto, mas vira sobre Leicester e aumenta sua vantagem na liderança\nOs Reds abriram sete pontos sobre o Chelsea\nCom outra grande atuação, o Liverpool venceu o Leicester de virada, por 3 a 1, e garantiu a liderança isolada da Premier League. Jordan Ayew abriu o placar para os Foxes no começo da etapa inicial. Pouco antes do intervalo, Gakpo marcou um golaço e deixou tudo igual. No segundo tempo, Curtis Jones e Salah viraram.\nConfira como foi a vitória dos Reds abaixo:\nPrimeiro tempo\nJogando em casa e com o apoio de sua torcida, o Liverpool começou melhor a partida e passou perto de abrir o placar. Salah foi lançado e obrigou Stolarczyk a fazer grande defesa. Por outro lado, o Leicester abriu o placar em uma de suas primeiras chegadas. Aos cinco, Mavididi recebeu rasteiro pelo lado esquerdo e cruzou para Ayew, que se antecipou a Robertson e bateu rasteiro no canto para abrir o placar: 1 a 0 Leicester.\nApós sair atrás do marcador, os Reds rondavam a área dos Foxes, mas não conseguiam levar muito perigo e pararam na boa marcação dos comandados de Ruud Van Nistelrooy. Em sua melhor oportunidade, Robertson acertou a trave após seu cruzamento ir na direção da meta.\nA equipe de Arne Slot seguiu pressionando e chegou perto de empatar. Em um contra-ataque, a bola chegou a Salah, que bateu cruzado no travessão. A pressão surtiu efeito e os Reds empataram na sequência com um golaço. Aos 45′, Gakpo recebeu no lado esquerdo, invadiu a entrada da área e bateu bonito para deixar tudo igual em Anfield: 1 a 1.\nSegundo tempo\nO líder da Premier League continuou pressionando na volta para a segunda etapa e, logo na sequência, virou a partida. Aos três, Mac Allister recebeu na área pelo lado direito e cruzou para Curtis Jones empurrar para o fundo das redes e virar a partida: 2 a 1 Liverpool.\nApós virar o jogo, o Leicester chegou perto de empatar em uma rara escapada. Daka recebeu um cruzamento na área, mas errou o tempo de bola e não conseguiu concluir. Por outro lado, Stolarczyk voltou a aparecer na partida e fez uma defesa importante para parar a conclusão de Darwin Núñez.\nOs comandados de Arne Slot chegaram a marcar o terceiro, mas o gol foi anulado em um lance milimétrico. Gakpo aproveitou a sobra da defesa e marcou o terceiro, mas a arbitragem marcou impedimento de Nuñez e a decisão foi confirmada pelo VAR.\nO Liverpool seguia pressionando e o terceiro parecia questão de tempo. Salah parou em outra grande defesa de Stolarczyk após bater de bico na área. Isso não fez muita falta e, na sequência, o egípcio ampliou. Aos 36′, o camisa 11 foi lançado pelo lado direito, cortou a marcação e bateu no canto direito para o fundo das redes: 3 a 1 Liverpool.\nApós marcar o terceiro, os Reds apenas tocaram a bola no campo de ataque e administraram sua vantagem. Ao som de sua torcida, a equipe de Arne Slot rondou a área do Leicester e esperou pelo apito final.\nCom o resultado, o Liverpool chega a 42 pontos na Premier League, tendo sete de vantagem sobre o vice-líder Chelsea. Por outro lado, a derrota faz o Leicester voltar à zona de rebaixamento e ficar com 12 pontos.",
