    "text": "The traditional leaders addressing journalists\nThe Sefwi Anhwiaso Traditional Council in the Western North Region has warned miscreants who want to foment trouble in Bibiani, and disturb the relative peace in the town to desist.\nAccording to the Traditional Council, a certain former Krontihene of Bibiani who currently has no position within the traditional Council is making some moves that could jeopardise the peace, and retard the development of the area.\nThe Council asserted that the said former Krontihene is creating problems for a Real Estate Developer who has started operations in Bibiani, and wants to create employment opportunities for the youth.\nThe Council noted that the Real Estate Developer’s business is genuine, and that the Paramount chief of Anhwiaso traditional area is aware of the operations.\n“We should all help to maintain the peace in Bibiani Anhwiaso Traditional area to pave way for more developmental projects to place in the area,” the Traditional Council insisted.\nAddressing the Media at Ogyeahoho’s palace at Sefwi Anhwiaso, Nana Bonya III, Atipemhene of Sefwi Anhwiaso Traditional Area explained that the overlord of the area, Ogyeahoho Yaw Gyebi, is the President of the National House of Chiefs, and also the President of the Western North Regional House of Chiefs.\n“Because of this, there is the need for us to be lovers of peace to serve as an example to other areas, and not allow anyone to cause trouble in the area,” he pointed out.\nHe stressed that, since the creation of the Western North Region by President Akufo-Addo, the people in the area, led by the Paramount Chief, are working hard to bring development to the area, and to give Bibiani-Anhwiaso-Bekwai a facelift.\n“And so we will not allow anybody to thwart the efforts the government and our Omanhene. As we speak, we have a University of Mines and Technology (UMaT) campus here in Bibiani. The Regional Education Directorate is also here, and these are attracting investors to the area,” he noted.\nNana Biri Kwaku II, Odikro of Bibiani Hwenapori, also added that the former Krontihene, Nana Ngoah Kumdom, about a year ago when Paramount Chief Ogyeahoho was performing the rites for smooth operations of the Bibiani Mines, incited the youth against the initiative.\n“I am appealing to the former Krontihene to allow peace to prevail to help in the rapid development of Bibiani,” he told journalists.\nFrom Emmanuel Opoku, Takoradi\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
