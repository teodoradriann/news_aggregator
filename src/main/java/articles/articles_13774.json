We came here knowing defence would be the key to success and only conceded three tries in six matches. The guys deserve a lot of credit.\n“We were down and out but credit to the guys. They deserve this and I am pleased we will be going to Paris.”\nOn Sunday, the Blitzboks outplayed Uganda, Canada and Great Britain to claim the final ticket to the Rugby Sevens at the Paris Summer Olympics, which runs from July 26 to August 11.\nWhat a season.... pic.twitter.com/04FzOopsdB\n— Springbok Sevens (@Blitzboks) June 23, 2024 Team captain Selvyn Davids praised his troops and the team's management for a job well done.\n“The guys wanted this.

    "text": "Una antigua planta de agave, famosa por florecer únicamente una vez cada cien años, ha comenzado a desplegar sus flores amarillas en el parque central de Hibiya en Tokio, atrayendo a numerosos locales y turistas. Cientos de personas se reunieron este miércoles en este parque en el corazón de la capital japonesa para presenciar este evento poco común, después de que la planta mostrara signos de floración desde el pasado 14 de julio. (Leer más: La falta de orden de floristas en Paloquemao que tiene inquietos a los habitantes de Bogotá: estas son las medidas de la Alcaldía). “Teníamos previsto comer cerca y al ver la noticia sobre la flor que se abre cada varias décadas, quisimos venir a verla”, relatan Ikuo Ito, de 72 años, y Nobuko Ito, de 67, una pareja de pensionados que viven en Suginami, al oeste de Tokio. Esta planta es una variedad de agave amarillo, también conocida como pita, originaria de México y el sur de Estados Unidos, y que ha sido distribuida a otros continentes como planta ornamental debido a su longevidad y adaptabilidad a climas áridos o extremos. Para muchas personas que frecuentan este parque, lo extraordinario ha sido observar cómo el largo tallo que culmina en las flores ha crecido desde mayo pasado hasta alcanzar los casi 8 metros de altura que tiene ahora. (Seguir leyendo: Científicos colombianos ayudaron a construir el 'árbol de la vida' más completo del mundo con más de 95.000 plantas con flores). “Llevo un par de semanas mirando la planta desde que empezó a florecer poco a poco, por lo que volveré la semana que viene a ver cómo avanza”, comenta Yukiko Kobayashi, una pensionada de unos 60 años que reside en Tokio y pasa por el parque después de sus clases de tenis. Para Kobayashi, lo especial es que “aunque no sea una flor vistosa, es una flor efímera”. Según los empleados del parque, la planta tiene más de 60 años, ya que hay fotos de la misma desde 1960 y estaría alcanzando ahora el final de su ciclo de vida, ya que el agave florece una sola vez antes de morir. Esta es la estrategia de reproducción de la planta, cuyas flores son polinizadas usualmente por murciélagos, antes de producir un fruto que contiene sus semillas.

Otra planta de este tipo que estaba en el mismo parque floreció en julio de 2019, aunque su tallo alcanzó una altura mucho menor. “Si fuera menos alta, podría ver más fácil las flores, pero debo mirarla ampliando las fotos, aunque agradezco que florezca poco a poco para que podamos disfrutarla durante más tiempo”, señala Chiyomi Shimizu, también pensionada de unos 60 años y residente en Tokio.

    "text": "Single mom moving into zero net energy house built in 2022 Habitat for Humanity blitz LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - A house built in the 2022 Habitat for Humanity blitz build is finally getting a homeowner. Caprisha Toliver will be receiving the keys on Saturday. Caprisha is a single mother of three and a first-time homeowner. “I’m gonna be the first homeowner out of all of my mother’s kids; not only did that motivate them, now they wanna do it, but it’s really exciting,” Caprisha said. She said the best part of becoming a homeowner is showing her kids that it is possible, “I’m just showing them that y’all can do whatever y’all want, all you have to do is put your mind to it. Don’t let nobody tell you that you can’t. It took me a little longer but if y’all start now y’all can accomplish anything.” Habitat’s project manager Brittney Morgan said, after almost two years, it’s a special moment to hand the keys over, “It’s really an honor and a privilege to be able to help people out and let people have a really nice and affordable place to live.” But Caprisha’s new home is not just any blitz build house, it’s one of the first zero net energy houses built in Lubbock, meaning the home will produce more energy than it consumes. “Solar panels on the house, so now a day’s energy - companies are buying solar back from the homeowners, so they should almost get paid to use electricity,” Project Manager Brittany Morgan said. Caprisha and her family were a part of the build in 2022 and they are eagerly anticipating their move in date. “It’s been a long process, so I’m just gonna rest and take it all in with my kids,” she said. Caprisha said, you don’t have to be where you come from and while she works hard for her kids, she says she did this for herself, “When we are the best us, they get the best us. When they see us doing our best they’re gonna want to do their best.” Habitat for Humanity will dedicate the house to Caprisha and her family at 3316 East Dartmouth on Saturday, Mar. 16 at 2 p.m. when she will be presented her keys. Then they will move in next week. Copyright 2024 KCBD. All rights reserved.",

(Image from Shutterstock) The Ohio Supreme Court has suspended a lawyer who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault after being accused of touching his stepdaughter’s 18-year-old friend in a sexual manner during a sleepover in which she became sick from drinking the alcohol that he supplied. In an April 25 [per curiam opinion opinion](https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2024/2024-Ohio-1540.pdf), Westlake, Ohio, lawyer Daniel E. Perrico was suspended for two years, with the second year stayed on condition that he commit no further misconduct, [Court News Ohio](https://www.courtnewsohio.gov/cases/2024/SCO/0425/231274.asp) reports. Perrico “adamantly denied” the accusations at the disciplinary hearing, according to the per curiam opinion. Perrico was accused of supplying his then-15-year-old stepdaughter and two of her 18-year-old friends with alcohol during the sleepover, which happened when Perrico’s wife was out of town. One of the older teenagers went to a basement bathroom to vomit, while the other went to an upstairs bathroom. The teen in the basement alleged that Perrico sat on the floor next to her in the bathroom, pulled her onto his lap, and began to sexually touch her over her clothes. She reported that Perrico said, “All the dirty things I could do to you right now.” The stepdaughter testified that she and Perrico eventually carried the teen out of the basement bathroom, with the stepdaughter carrying the teen’s feet. The stepdaughter testified that Perrico put his hands under the teen’s armpits and put his hand on her breasts. The teen eventually told the others what allegedly happened in the bathroom. Perrico’s stepdaughter didn’t tell her mother for about five months because she feared that it would strain the marriage. When the mother learned of the allegations, she told Perrico to leave the house and later filed for divorce. The teens reported the incident to a Summit County, Ohio, sheriff’s deputy. The teen alleging sexual touching agreed to make a recorded call to Perrico. On the call, the teen said Perrico had gotten her intoxicated and groped her. He said he didn’t recall doing those things, but if he did, he was sorry. Perrico was charged at first with three counts of furnishing alcohol to minors and sexual imposition, a third-degree misdemeanor. He pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying alcohol and to assault, a first-degree misdemeanor. He received a suspended sentence of 120 days in jail and was placed on community control. Perrico later contended that the assault charge was for the physical harm caused by supplying alcohol to the teen. In a partial concurrence, Chief Justice Sharon L. Kennedy said Perrico should have received a full two-year suspension. Her opinion was joined by one other justice. Another concurring justice, Justice Michael P. Donnelly, complained that Perrico avoided the sexual imposition charge in a plea bargain that did not accurately represent the alleged crime. “Factually baseless plea agreements undermine” the Ohio Board of Professional Conduct’s ability to do its job, the concurrence said. If Perrico had been found guilty of sexual imposition, he would have been required to register as a sex offender, and his conviction could not be sealed. The assault charge avoided those consequences. “But the lack of a factual record surrounding Perrico’s plea gives him a third perk—the chance to craft the narrative of his criminal conduct to suit his own ends,” Donnelly wrote. “In short, Perrico pleaded guilty to a crime that appears to have no factual basis whatsoever in the criminal record because the result was of greater benefit to him. The rest is lost to the black box of plea negotiations and agreements, into which one set of law and facts go and out of which a result emerges, seemingly without factual support or explanation.” Perrico did not immediately respond to an ABA Journal voicemail seeking comment. He was represented by Peter Thomas Cahoon, who did not immediately respond to a voicemail and an email seeking comment.",

    "text": "C'est un authentique miracle de Noël qu'une famille a vécu le 25 décembre dans l'Hérault.Après la chute de leur voiture dans un cours d'eau, le jeune Nathan, 13 ans, a sauvé sa mère et sa sœur de la noyade.Le 20H de TF1 a recueilli le témoignage du jeune héros et de sa maman, encore émue et forcément (très) fière de son fils. \"On était garés sur le bord de la route et on a commencé à tomber.\" Lundi 25 décembre, le jour de Noël, Jessica Gross et ses deux enfants s'arrêtent le long d'une route de la commune de Cessenon-sur-Orb (Hérault). Au volant, au bord d'un fossé, la mère de famille tente de reculer mais perd l'équilibre. La voiture glisse, fait un tonneau, avant de terminer violemment sa chute dans le cours d'eau en contrebas. \"J'ai perdu connaissance. Je suis tombée le corps face à l'eau. Mon fils a vu que j'avais la tête dans l'eau\", relate avec émotion la mère de famille dans le reportage du 20H de TF1 à retrouver en tête de cet article. Indemne et conscient, son fils Nathan, âgé de 13 ans, fait alors preuve d'un sang-froid exceptionnel. Après avoir porté secours à sa mère, qui risquait la noyade, l'adolescent parvient à évacuer sa petite sœur de l'habitacle. C'est normal, c'est ma mère et ma familleNathan \"Elle était sur le ventre. Elle ne parlait plus, elle ne répondait plus, elle ne bougeait plus. Je l'ai sortie de l'eau [...] C'est normal, c'est ma mère et ma famille\", confie avec simplicité le jeune garçon. Après avoir porté secours à sa mère et à sa sœur, il parvient à alerter des automobilistes. Les secours sont prévenus, et interviennent rapidement sur place. Quatre jours après, Jessica ne réalise toujours pas l'exploit réalisé par son fils. \"Les rôles se sont inversés. J'étais incapable de me calmer, j'étais tétanisée par la peur\", confie-t-elle. \"Je suis fier de lui, je ne le remercierai jamais assez.\" Lire aussi \"Un miraculé\" : dans les Pyrénées-Orientales, un homme sauvé après une chute de plus de 100 mètres Un geste héroïque également salué par les sapeurs-pompiers de la commune, où le jeune garçon a été reçu. \"Ce que tu as fait, c'est exemplaire\", l'a félicité le capitaine David Sylvestre, chef de secteur. \"Ça fait 32 ans que je suis pompier volontaire, c'est la première fois que je vois un gamin de 13 ans réagir comme ça\", souligne le pompier à notre micro. \"Ça nous surprend parce que l'histoire se termine bien\", ajoute son collègue, le caporal François Ayuda, qui rappelle que ce \"conte de Noël\" aurait pu \"se finir très mal.\" La mésaventure aura en tout cas permis à Nathan de trouver sa vocation : plus tard, il veut être pompier.",

Despite limited mobile coverage, the soldiers have maintained constant updates with the civil administration, working shoulder-to-shoulder with the SDRF, NDRF, and local officials.\nNotably, it isn’t just supplies that arrived, but also doctors. In makeshift tents set up next to collapsed homes, army medics are treating everything, including the provision of first aid and distribution of ration kits to affected families.\nIn partnership with civil administration, the Army has ensured the delivery of relief material to remote villages cut off by the flood. Aid has already reached Degi (July 7), Rushad (July 8), and Chapad (July 9).\nAll columns are in communication via mobile networks, with limited coverage at some locations like Thunag.\nSatellite communications, including ISAT phone, RS STARSV and HX systems, have been provided to ensure uninterrupted operational connectivity.\nThe Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, is scheduled to visit Thunag to assess the ongoing relief operations.\nSimilarly, the Brigade Commander is also visiting Mandi for an operational update and interaction with the relief columns.\nA meeting with the Chief Minister and Deputy Commissioner, Mandi, is also planned to enhance coordination and response.\nThe Indian Army said it remains committed to supporting the citizens of Himachal Pradesh during this crisis and continues to stand by the civil administration in its time of need.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",

    "text": "The Cookers keep it entertaining with music, remarkable stories Formed around 2007 as a tribute to the classic 1965 [live album](https://freddiehubbardmusic.com/portfolio-item/the-night-of-the-cookers/) Night of the Cookers, the seven all-stars of The Cookers [returned](https://www.knkx.org/studio-sessions/2012-07-10/the-cookers-bebop-supergroup) to the KNKX studios for a performance for the ages. This supergroup, defined by its members extensive experience, is still going strong. They played two shows at Dimitriou's Jazz Alley in Seattle when they took some time for this recording at Studio X. Band leader David Weiss is one of three younger Cookers, with saxophonists [Donald Harrison](https://www.knkx.org/2022-04-28/the-nouveau-swing-of-donald-harrison-jr-big-chief-and-nea-jazz-master) and Craig Handy, all at around 60 years old. The veterans include Weiss’ fellow trumpeter [Eddie Henderson](https://www.knkx.org/jazz/2023-04-24/trumpeter-eddie-hendersons-one-of-a-kind-path-to-the-music-scene), pianist [George Cables](https://www.knkx.org/jazz-northwest/2018-11-11/celebrating-george-cables-concert-at-jazz-port-townsend) and drummer Billy Hart who are all around 20 years older than Weiss. The elder statesman is 88-year-old bassist Cecil McBee. Far from reliving past glories, the mission of the Cookers has always been pushing the music forward. Weiss explained, after performing dynamic post-bop originals from Cables and McBee, the band plays mostly music they’ve written. This group of legends has become a serious band with a sound all its own. The gentlemen drew on their original inspiration after their session to share stories of their favorite moments on stage. Henderson described his night in the audience for the Night of the Cookers recording with his mentor, trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, while Hart pointed to performances with Herbie Hancock’s famed early '70s fusion band. McBee topped them both with a double header: After an early evening performance in 1966 Los Angeles, he was surprised after the gig with kudos from the bass legend Ray Brown who’d been in the audience. Then McBee drove to the Monterey Jazz Festival and rushed on stage just in time for a late-night performance with sax and flute great Charles Lloyd’s band. The performance was recorded and became Lloyd’s legendary [live album](https://charleslloyd.com/discography/forest-flower/) Forest Flower. The Cookers could keep you entertained with stories from their amazing careers for hours. We know you’ll enjoy this interview at the KNKX studios, but probably not as much as you’ll love their music. Musicians: - Eddie Henderson - trumpet - David Weiss - trumpet - Donald Harrison - alto saxophone - Craig Handy - tenor saxophone - George Cables - piano - Cecil McBee - bass - Billy Hart - drums Songs: - Blackfoot (G.Cables) - Peacemaker (C.McBee) - The Mystery of Monifa Brown (G.Cables)",

    "text": "Cortesía\nYali Reinoso, quien era abogada defensora penal en su Venezuela natal, llegó a Denver como lo han hecho casi todos los inmigrantes de Sudamérica.\nPor The Colorado Sun\nDurante dos meses, caminó, cruzó ríos peligrosos que casi arrastran a su hija y recorrió kilómetros a través del Tapón del Darién, una jungla implacable y sin caminos que conecta Colombia y Panamá.\nEn un tren a través de México, Reinoso vio a una mujer que había muerto congelada mientras viajaba de polizón encima de un vagón de tren. Después de la muerte de la mujer, ya no pudo sostener a su hija, quien cayó y murió.\nReinoso, su esposo y su hija de 16 años habían esperado durante 15 días a que se detuviera un tren para que ellos y otros migrantes pudieran subir a él. Finalmente se dieron cuenta de que los trenes no se detendrían, por lo que se pararon, peligrosamente, en las vías para obligar a uno a detenerse y luego se apiñaron.\nReinoso se quedó sin comida en el tren, y un día tuvo que bajarse rápidamente para comprar algo de comer para su marido, que tiene una discapacidad física porque una pierna es más corta que la otra, y su hija, que tiene una discapacidad intelectual. El tren empezó a partir sin ella.\n“Así que tuve que correr mucho”, dijo Reinoso, con un nudo en la garganta al recordarlo. “Tuve que correr y correr y correr hasta que pude alcanzarlo, pero casi pierdo la vida también”.\nElla se encuentra entre los casi 40.000 inmigrantes, en su mayoría de Venezuela, que han llegado a Denver en los últimos 15 meses para escapar de la pobreza y el malestar político. Reinoso y su familia llegaron en autobús desde Texas el 26 de diciembre y han estado viviendo en una habitación de hotel financiada por la ciudad. Su estancia, sin embargo, expira la próxima semana.\nReinoso, quien ha solicitado asilo debido a la persecución política en Venezuela, no puede ejercer la abogacía en Estados Unidos ni tiene un permiso de trabajo. Está ayudando a otros inmigrantes a solicitar asilo y autorización de trabajo en All Souls, una organización sin fines de lucro que ha estado brindando asistencia a los recién llegados que viven en hoteles y campamentos cerca de Tower Road en la parte noreste de la ciudad.\nReinoso habló con The Colorado Sun esta semana para un evento virtual sobre la crisis migratoria, que ha llevado a Denver al límite, ya que la ciudad ha acogido a más inmigrantes per cápita que cualquier otra en los Estados Unidos. Aproximadamente la mitad de los 40.000 inmigrantes que llegaron en autobús desde la frontera de Texas optaron por quedarse en Denver, mientras que la ciudad compró billetes de autobús de ida a otros destinos para el resto.\nReinoso, hablando a través de un intérprete, dijo que les dice a sus compañeros “hermanos y hermanas inmigrantes” que no puede darles asesoramiento legal, pero puede ayudarlos a comprender el proceso de solicitud de asilo y explicarles las reglas que rodean la autorización federal de trabajo. “Lo que hago para ayudarlos es tratar de poner todos sus documentos y trámites en orden”, dijo. “Eso no significa necesariamente que su solicitud vaya a tener éxito. Podrían enfrentarse a la deportación. Intento ser lo más claro posible con eso”.\nSegún las normas federales actuales destinadas a acelerar el proceso, los inmigrantes que llegaron antes del 31 de julio son elegibles para solicitar estatus de protección temporal y permisos de trabajo. El resto puede solicitar asilo en la frontera o después de ingresar a Estados Unidos, y son elegibles para solicitar autorización de trabajo 150 días después de solicitar asilo.\nLa mayoría de las personas huyen de Venezuela porque luchan por sobrevivir o comprar comida, dijo Reinoso. “La situación económica de Venezuela es tan mala que la gente gana aproximadamente 100 dólares al mes”, dijo.\nReinoso huyó de Venezuela hace cuatro años después de decir que el presidente Nicolás Maduro la había señalado como opositora política debido a su trabajo para distribuir ayuda humanitaria, incluidos alimentos y medicinas, a personas que pasaban hambre. Ella y su familia se mudaron a Colombia, donde permanecieron hasta que las autoridades colombianas aceptaron cooperar con Maduro, dijo Reinoso.\nTemía que su nombre fuera entregado a las autoridades venezolanas, por lo que Reinoso y su familia comenzaron el viaje hacia la frontera con Estados Unidos.\nUna de las peores partes del viaje fue cuando la hija de Reinoso casi se ahoga al cruzar un río en la selva.\n“Tuvimos que cruzar el río tomados de la mano porque la corriente era muy, muy fuerte”, recordó. “Pero debido a que el río era tan fuerte y alto, nuestra hija se soltó y dejó de tomarnos de la mano. Y fue gracias a otras personas que estaban alrededor que pudimos salvarla”.\nSemanas después, tuvieron que cruzar el Río Grande hacia Estados Unidos. Usaron su ropa para cubrir los cables y púas que los mantenían alejados, dijo Reinoso, y luego se sumergieron en el agua fría.\nLea más en The Colorado Sun",

Al respecto, fue posible pasar del 16 por ciento en 2020; al 85 durante el presente año.\nDe esta manera, la Fiscalía le habla con resultados a la ciudadanía y los invita para que denuncien los delitos que los afectan.\nLa Fiscalía habla con resultados.\nVHGB/MAGA/FSJ/DSS\nLa información contenida en este boletín de prensa corresponde a la narración de los hechos noticiosos objetivos, suministrados por los funcionarios encargados de adelantar las investigaciones penales al interior de la Fiscalía General de la Nación.
