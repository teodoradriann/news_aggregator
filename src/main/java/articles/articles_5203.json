    "text": "A Public Health Hero: USU's Judy Sims Recognized for Dedication to Water Quality Over 50 Years By [Alyssa Regis](mailto:alyssa.regis@usu.edu) | Just how does one become an expert in onsite wastewater (septic) systems? For Judy Sims, the first celebration of Earth Day, held in 1970 was her inspiration. It sparked a lifelong interest in protecting human health and the environment. It also led her toward an education in environmental biology, and more particularly, the interaction of wastes and soils. \"I just started putting soil and waste together because not many people put those two fields together at the time,” Sims said. Drinking water supplies can become contaminated from wastewater in soils, and Sims focused her research on that interaction, with a focus on protecting public health and the environment. Sims came to USU as a research biologist in 1982, and she has been involved in on-site wastewater treatment research and applications ever since. Her research garnered recognition from Utah political leaders, who recognized the need for a wastewater training program to support sustainable population growth in the state. Sims was an integral part of the team that developed the “ [Utah On-Site Wastewater Treatment Training Program](https://uwrl.usu.edu/research/owt),” headquartered at the [Utah Water Research Laboratory](https://uwrl.usu.edu/). The program originated from a desire to increase awareness and provide training for septic system regulators, designers, installers, pumpers, homeowners and other stakeholders in the design, installation and operation of on-site wastewater treatment systems. It developed into the statewide professional training program that it is today. Sims has served as the Program's coordinator for 25 years. After 42 years of service at USU, Sims is being honored as a public health hero. The Bear River Health Department named Sims a 2023 Public Health Hero for Environmental Health Services at the Cache Chamber Leadership Luncheon on May 21. This award recognizes her outstanding dedication and contribution to the fields of environmental science and public health, and her commitment to protecting Utah’s valuable surface and groundwater resources. Sims received the call about her award while she was recovering from a severe and life-threatening illness. She said that the timing of the award seemed particularly touching for her. “It was really special to be recognized for all the work that I’ve put in for a long period of time,” she said. Sims has won several awards over the years in recognition of her work. In 2019, the Utah Division of Water Quality presented her with the Calvin K. Sudweeks Award for her leadership and achievement in the field of water pollution control and water quality improvements in Utah. Over all her years in wastewater and soils, Sims has continued to educate and inspire people coming through the training program, sharing practical knowledge that her students use daily. “That’s why this is so satisfying,” Sims said. “We’re teaching the people who are out there working in the field every day on septic systems, teaching them what they need to know, and I really enjoy that.” The Bear River Health Department expressed gratitude at the awards ceremony for all of Sims’s contributions to public health: “We are privileged to associate and learn from her knowledge and experience, year after year, as she trains and educates the future generations of public health professionals.” WRITER Alyssa Regis Communications and Outreach Specialist Utah Water Research Laboratory 435-797-1807 [alyssa.regis@usu.edu](mailto:alyssa.regis@usu.edu) CONTACT Judy Sims Coordinator, Utah On-Site Wastewater Treatment Training Program Utah Water Research Laboratory [judith.sims@usu.edu](mailto:judith.sims@usu.edu) Comments and questions regarding this article may be directed to the contact person listed on this page.",

Emmanuel Macron expressed to the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem “his deep concern” about “the dramatic situation” of the Catholic parish in Gaza where two parishioners were killed “in an undignified manner” on December 16 by an Israeli soldier, the Prime Minister said on Sunday. ‘Elysium.\nDuring a telephone interview on Saturday the day before Christmas with Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzabella, the French president spoke of “his deep concern over the dramatic situation in the Latin parish of Gaza”, where “hundreds civilians of all faiths (…) have been living under bombs and bullets for more than two months while the faithful and the sisters take care of sick, elderly or disabled people.”\nHe expressed his condolences “for the death of two parishioners, killed in an undignified manner a few days ago”. On December 16, a mother and her daughter, both Christians, were killed by an Israeli soldier in front of the only Catholic church in Gaza. Pope Francis denounced the death of these two women the next day.\nA message of “solidarity” to Christian communities\nIn the run-up to the Christmas mass, in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, Emmanuel Macron asked the Latin Patriarch “to send a message of peace and solidarity to all Christians in the Holy Land, and to assure them that France stands at their side.”\nThe president reaffirmed “France’s loyalty to its commitments, and in particular to the particular role of protection of a certain number of Christian communities, exercised through the French consulate general in Jerusalem”.\nREAD Also: explosions heard during the night in the center of kyiv, dozens injured according to the mayor\n“This responsibility, inherited from history, will be fully assumed in the face of the contemporary risks weighing on these communities,” assured Emmanuel Macron who at the same time sent a message of “support” and “solidarity” to the Christian communities, via the consulate from France to Jerusalem.\n#Gaza #Emmanuel #Macron #expresses #concern #dramatic #situation #Catholic #parish",

I don’t want to see f***ing SKY and Bianca. I want to see Bianca and Rhea. I want to see Rhea and I don’t give a f**k who … she’s a f***ing star man.”\nOn why Adam Pearce should be fired: “Number one, I would fire the General Manager for putting Bianca as the referee and not having it be a no DQ match. That’s a stipulation right there. Bianca doesn’t want to wrestle Rhea, of course she’s going to f***ing [get involved]. I mean to put your babyface in that predicament, I don’t think that’s a good thing.”\nNOTE: If you have any news tips or podcast recaps that you’d like to send in for us to post (full credit will be given to you), please email me at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d98b9ab5b8abb2898e8a9980b8b1b6b6f7bab6b4).",

Foto: Paulo Paiva/Sport Recife\nGonçalo Paciência, novo reforço do Leão para 2025, foi apresentado nesta quinta-feira (16), na Ilha do Retiro. O atacante português, que irá vestir a camisa número sete, tem contrato até o final deste ano. O jogador comentou sobre sua expectativa para 2025 no Sport.\n“Ajudar a equipe com os objetivos, ajudar todos os meus companheiros, principalmente os da minha posição, o Coutinho e o Zeca. Acho que se eu der o meu melhor, vamos crescer como equipe. E um dos principais objetivos como jogador também é ser o melhor possível para que possamos competir com as pessoas de maneira saudável”, comentou.\n“Acho que todos temos que pensar assim, não só como centroavante, mas volante e zagueiro. Acho que isso é importante para uma equipe grande, com tantos jogos e com um calendário tão apertado. No fundo minha expectativa é ajudar, marcar gols e ser mais, pois só assim se consegue ter uma equipe competitiva que alcança os objetivos”, completou.\nGonçalo Paciência se formou nas categorias de base do Porto. O jogador é filho do lendário ex-atacante Luso Domingos, também treinador. Chegou a ser artilheiro da equipe nas Olimpíadas Rio 2016, marcando três gols nos três jogos da fase de grupos. Ainda esteve em duas Eurocopas Sub-21.\nLeiaJá também: Marquinhos Santos mira correção das “brechas” na defesa do Náutico",

En tanto, en Juan Fernández la pleamar será entre las 8.30 y 10.00 horas del viernes 2 de agosto”, afirmó.\nDebido a esta situación climática, Berger planteó la necesidad de prudencia y cautela ante el potencial riesgo de sobrepaso de olas y daños que pudieran ocurrir en la infraestructura del borde costero. “Sobre todo es crucial respetar las normas de seguridad; no transitar por sectores rocosos, no ingresar al mar durante el evento; ni tampoco desarrollar actividades náuticas y deportivas sin la debida autorización”, sostuvo.",

    "text": "MADRID, 23 Ago. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl Gobierno de Corea del Norte ha alertado de que la venta de helicópteros AH-64 y otros elementos logísticos relacionados por valor de 3.500 millones de dólares (3.200 millones de euros) a Corea del Sur es \"un acto de provocación temeraria que aumenta deliberadamente la inestabilidad de la seguridad en la región\".\n\"Nos oponemos firmemente y rechazamos la acumulación de armas de EEUU y sus fuerzas vasallas que representa un grave peligro para el entorno de seguridad regional y aumenta la tensión militar y les advertimos seriamente de las consecuencias que esto conlleva. La acumulación de armas de un lado contra el otro lado, ya sea de escala grande o pequeña, puede afectar la situación militar y política en la región\", reza un comunicado del Ministerio de Exteriores norcoreano recogido por la agencia de noticias KCNA.\nEn este sentido, ha remarcado que este anuncio se ha realizado \"en medio de la tensión política y militar cada vez mayor en la península de Corea debido a los ejercicios militares conjuntos a gran escala entre Estados Unidos y Corea del Sur\" y ha hecho hincapié en que Washington \"está ahora volviéndose más activo en su venta de armas\" también a otros aliados en la región, como Japón, \"desafío a la seguridad\" que \"no se puede pasar por alto\".\n\"Las crisis de seguridad en diferentes partes del mundo demuestran claramente que la oferta de armas letales por parte de EEUU es un factor clave en la escalada de la confrontación militar y la contradicción en la región y en la alteración del equilibrio militar, aumentando así el peligro de un nuevo conflicto\", ha manifestado.\nCon todo, ha informado de que ante \"el suministro de material bélico y equipo letal\" a aliados de Washington en la región, su estrategia estará focalizada en fortalecerse militarmente para proteger su seguridad e intereses nacionales. \"Llevaremos a cabo de manera constante las actividades militares necesarias para la autodefensa a fin de controlar el desequilibrio militar y la inestabilidad que puedan causar\", ha concluido.\nLeer más acerca de: Estados Unidos Corea del Norte Corea del Sur",

    "text": "Sadie Robertson, Host of 11th Annual K-LOVE Fan Awards, Encourages This Generation to ‘Be the Light of the World’\n-\nMilton QuintanillaCrosswalk Headlines Contributor\n- Published May 31, 2024\nAuthor and podcast host Sadie Robertson Huff encourages this generation of young Christians to “be the light of the world.”\nHuff, who rose to fame in the reality series “Duck Dynasty,” will host the 11th annual K-LOVE Fan Awards along with Brandon Lake on TBN at 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. ET. She is also nominated for the Podcast of the Year Award for her “WHOA That’s Good” podcast.\n“What an honor to know that people care about it, and are nominating it,” Huff told\n Church Leaders. “If people listen to my podcast and receive what I receive when listening to others’ podcasts, that is so special to me.”\nMoreover, she encouraged this generation of young Christians to “be the light of the world” because it’s what “\nJesus said” for his followers to be.\n“I think when things get dark, it’s so tempting to do what he said not to do and hide and be like, ‘Oh, it’s so dark,’ and get scared,” Huff said.\nCan we embed this GT video as well:\nSadie Robertson Huff | 2024 K LOVE Fan Awards (red carpet) from ccm-magazine on GodTube.\nBut “you” are called “to actually help make the world a better place” by being that light, she continued. “So it’s not the time to cower back. It’s not the time to hide; it’s actually the time to fully take him at his word and be the light.”\nHuff hopes that people can begin to take that command “seriously and take on the call of their life” that Jesus has given them.\n“In this generation, we struggle a lot with our identity—with who we are,” Huff said. “And I love that that’s one place in Scripture that Jesus says, ‘You are the light of the world.’ Like that is your identity.”\n“And when you step into that,” she concluded. “I think people are gonna be a lot more confident in who they were created to be because they’ll be living it.”\nImage Courtesy: ©GettyImages/Terry Wyatt / Stringer\nMilton Quintanilla is a freelance writer and content creator.
