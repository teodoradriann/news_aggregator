    "text": "One of the greatest treats baseball can provide you is the list of players needed to get through a season. Some of you probably remember Tyler Cyr, Damon Jones, or Hyun Soo Kim.\nYou’ll find many of these castoffs on rebuilding teams, specifically in the first year. The new front office hasn’t been able to establish a young core and need players to get through a season. For example, the 32-109\nChicago White Sox have used 61 players this season.\nThis Marlins team is no exception. After an 84-win season that made the playoffs last year, new President of Baseball Operations Peter Bendix is in a rebuilding mindset, trying to turn the Marlins into a completely different type of fish from Florida.\nYou will see some players who could be here for the long haul but this is mostly a cast of vagabond players who are getting opportunities other clubs might’ve never offered.\nThe Core\nThe club does feature a handful of promising young infielders for the future. Xavier Edwards was acquired in November of 2022 from the\nTampa Bay Rays because of rule-five restrictions and has now become the primary leadoff option for Skip Schumaker.\nHis power was always a question coming up and he possesses a .085 ISO but carries a short stroke and elite plate discipline. His .840 OPS and 22 stolen bases make him a solid offensive threat.\nJake Burger has had a Nick Castellanos-like offensive season. His first three months were a disaster with a .601 OPS as a bat-first third baseman who should probably DH. He’s since turned a major corner with a .952 OPS since the start of July.\nMike Elias needs to stop acquiring washed-up NL East pitchers because Craig Kimbrel will almost certainly cost Baltimore a playoff game, Gregory Soto has an ERA over 6, and Trevor Rogers got demoted to AAA.\nBendix took advantage of Elias’s soft heart and stole Connor Norby, who’s smashing a .984 OPS in his first 14 games with the Fish.\nKyle Stowers was another member of Bendix’s heist in Maryland but started on the wrong foot with his new club. In his first 20 games, Stowers struck out 26 times in 70 plate appearances with just a .341 OPS.\nHe’s found new life over his last ten games, hitting .314 with a .968 OPS.\nStay Loose and Sexy Reunion\nAfter Dave Dombrowski broke up the best band in Philadelphia history by trading Cristian Pache to Baltimore, they reunited in Philadelphia on August 13. Pache went 0 for 3 with three strikeouts.\nWith Ranger Suárez going on Thursday, it’s easy to assume we get a reunion with Pache in the lineup. He’s struggled with the Marlins with a .522 OPS but has played sharp defense in center field.\nTime Flies By\nRemember Jeff Conine? Pick 22 in the 1992 expansion draft by the then Florida Marlins who went on to win a\nWorld Series a few years later? His son is now a member of the Marlins and making an impact.\nGriffin Conine has been one of the few feel-good stories for the club this year and he’s come through with some instant offense. Through his first 26 plate appearances, he has a 117 OPS+, and this blast back in San Francisco.\nGRIFFIN CONINE'S FIRST MAJOR LEAGUE HOMER— Miami Marlins (@Marlins)\n[#MarlinsBeisbol] [pic.twitter.com/a6vly98zcA] [September 1, 2024]\nRemember the Giancarlo Stanton trade?\nAfter winning the 2017 National League MVP, the Marlins made the completely rational decision to move on from one of the best players in franchise history because he was making more than the league minimum.\nThe trade netted Starlin Castro, pitcher Jorge Guzmán, and infielder José Devers. Castro played two full seasons with a 97 OPS+, Guzmán pitched less than three total innings for the Marlins, and Devers had a 69 OPS+ in 2021 in 46 plate appearances.\nAfter spending nearly three full seasons in the Marlins minor league system, Devers is back with the club in September. He’s one for four with a single.\nThe Schlock\nDerek Hill is on his third team of the season, starting with the\nTexas Rangers, then getting claimed by the San Francisco Giants, and now landing here. He started strong but has struggled since being acquired by the Marlins with an 88 OPS+ overall.\nDavid Hensley was a part of the 2022\nHouston Astros World Series team, getting two singles in seven at-bats that series against the Phillies. Connor Brogdon struck him out on a changeup.\nConnor Brogdon, Wicked Changeups.— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja)\n5Ks in 2 ip.\n[pic.twitter.com/D9BrhqOxI6] [November 4, 2022]\nAdam Oller pitched for the\nOakland Athletics the prior two seasons with a 7.09 ERA in 28 games. His delivery has a little bit of funk and he’s developed a nasty slurve. Opponents have a 39.1% whiff rate on it in his three solid starts as a Marlin. He’s scheduled to start on Thursday.\nNew career-high 8 strikeouts for Adam Oller tonight (and he's still cruising)— Fish On First (@FishOnFirst)\n[pic.twitter.com/4xGaenxb0r] [August 31, 2024]\nNot to be confused with the FanGraphs writer Michael Baumann, Mike Baumann is a right-handed reliever for the Marlins who throws 97 miles per hour but doesn’t know where it’s going. It’s an ongoing Twitter joke.\nJonah Bride spent the last two seasons with Oller in Oakland and hit just .192 in 293 plate appearances. He’s given the Marlins league-average production at first base and took Tyler Phillips deep back in Philadelphia.\nXzavion Curry pitched in 52 games and started 15 for the\nCleveland Guardians over the last three years with a 4.45 ERA. He’s a right-handed option out of the Marlins bullpen.\nAustin Kitchen is a left-handed reliever who has spent most of his professional career in the\nColorado Rockies organization before making his big league debut this year with the Marlins. He has a funny name.\nCan a real organization hire Skip Schumaker this off-season?\nIn early April,\nthe Marlins voided Skip Schumaker’s club option for 2025. He will be a free agent after the season and I hope a team with serious hopes for winning gives him a shot.\nHis first year with the Marlins was an overwhelming success. They made the playoffs despite injuries to Sandy Alcántara and Eury Pérez, leading to Schumaker taking home the Manager of the Year award for 2023.\nHis roster had just five hitters with an OPS+ above 100 and they won 84 games despite a -57 run differential.\nHe passed the eye test whenever I saw him manage. He knew when to pull his starting pitcher for the most part and when to use a hitter off the bench. He did a solid job of taking advantage of matchups with his bullpen. It was a very sound job which is all you want from the position.\nHe’s not a perfect manager and I would prefer Rob Thomson on the Phillies but they won’t be looking for a new one. If you’re looking for a new manager and want to be a serious team next season, call Schumaker so he doesn’t land with the White Sox.\nTheir 2010 uniforms were underrated.\nTheir late 90s uniforms are classics and will be worn Friday night of this series but their uniforms from the mid-2010s were also great.\n[September 5, 2024]\nI liked the vibe these jerseys gave off. The white ones looked clean, the greys weren’t terrible, the black ones brought out the orange well, and even the orange jerseys were ok. They’re certainly an upgrade over what the club has worn since.",

    "title": "Group of Palestinian-Americans skip Blinken meeting over Biden admin’s support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza | Politics | kwwl.com",
    "text": "(CNN) — A number of Palestinian-Americans refused to attend a roundtable meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday to discuss the [situation in Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/world/middleeast/israel) in protest against the Biden administration’s ongoing support for Israel’s offensive in the war-torn strip – a military campaign that has exacted a massive humanitarian toll. “We do not know what more Secretary Blinken or President (Joe) Biden need to hear or see to compel them to end their complicity in this genocide,” several of those who rejected the invitation said in a press statement distributed by the non-profit Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU). “They show us every day whose lives they value and whose lives they consider disposable. We will not be attending this discussion which can only amount to a box-ticking exercise. Our families, our community and all Palestinians deserve better,” the signatories wrote. “There is one thing that we, our community and countless others around the US and the world, including American unions representing nearly 8 million workers and at least 47 US cities, have been asking of this administration: to demand a permanent ceasefire to save Palestinians lives and stop the destruction of Gaza,” they wrote. “A meeting of this nature at this moment in time is insulting and performative.” Blinken and other members of the Biden administration have [called on Israel to do more to protect civilian](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/07/politics/blinken-israel-middle-east-tensions/index.html)s and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The officials, however, have continually rejected the idea of a ceasefire, instead advocating for “humanitarian pauses.” Thursday’s meeting with Blinken comes amid continued outrage from many progressive Democrats, Muslim and younger voters about the administration’s handling of Gaza – opposition that poses a growing political problem for Biden. The refusal of several invitees to attend underscores the immense anger felt by many in the United States – including some within the federal government – over the toll from the conflict, which was launched following [Hamas’ brutal attack](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/09/middleeast/hamas-attack-strategy-israel-mime-intl/index.html) on Israel on October 7. More than 26,000 have been killed, hundreds of thousands have been displaced, and Gaza is on the brink of famine. More than 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the offensive. Six people did attend the meeting, a source familiar told CNN, and those who attended felt conflicted about doing so, but felt they should take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the need for urgent change in US policy toward Gaza. ‘Soul-searching’ One of the invitees to the roundtable, Dr. Tariq Haddad, said in an intensely personal, 12-page letter to Blinken that he initially intended to go to the meeting. However, “after a lot of soul-searching I have decided that I cannot in good conscience meet with you today knowing this administration’s policies have been responsible for the death of over 80 of my family members including dozens of children, the suffering of hundreds of my remaining family, the famine my family is currently subjected to and the destruction of all my family’s homes,” Haddad wrote in the letter. “The more I thought about this meeting, the more I could not emotionally bring myself to look you in the eyes, Secretary Blinken, knowing you and President Biden have knowingly contributed to the suffering and murder of so many of my family, the homelessness and dispossession of 2 million Gazans, and the famine that has befallen my remaining family members,” Haddad said. “How does one meet for what I was told would be 3 minutes, with a person you hold responsible for not just the killing of your child, but rather the murder of over 80 of your family members?” he asked in his letter. “How do I look you in the eyes knowing you couldn’t even do the basic minimum like calling for a ceasefire to end the suffering and carnage, and even worse, are cutting off humanitarian assistance to 2 million people going through a famine of historic proportions,” he wrote, appearing to reference the suspension of US aid to the UN’s main relief agency in Gaza, UNRWA. “My family are subsisting on animal feed, Secretary Blinken, because of your policies,” he said. “You could have called for a cease-fire at any point in the past four months and ended all this suffering and death, and you have not. You could have used your diplomatic pressure to end the suffering, and you chose not to. You could have recognized that shutting off aid to an area that is experiencing the worst famine and human rights disaster in modern history is unethical, yet you chose not to. This is why it is very difficult emotionally for me to meet you today, to somehow normalize a meeting with an administration that continues day after day to cause so much suffering and death with their policies,” he wrote. Haddad urged Blinken to call for an immediate ceasefire, “end the continued transfer of US military reserve equipment to the Israeli military to stop further murder,” “call for an immediate withdrawal out of Gaza and equality for the Palestinian people,” and a “call for an end to the Israeli occupation, for equal rights, freedoms, and laws in this land regardless of one’s religion, ethnicity, or background.” Haddad told CNN that the letter – in which he also included photos of some of his relatives who have been killed – was going to be handed directly to Blinken at Thursday’s meeting. The source familiar with the meeting said some parts of it were read out loud to the top US diplomat during the hour-and-a-half long session at the State Department. That source said Blinken seemed engaged, but largely stuck to talking points in his remarks. At a briefing Thursday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller confirmed that Blinken met with “a number of leaders in the Palestinian-American community.” “It was the latest in a series of meetings that the Secretary has had with individuals and organizations both within the department and from outside the department that hold a wide range of views across the ideological and political spectrum,” Miller said. “He has held these meetings because he thinks it’s important to hear directly from individuals as I said, both inside the State Department and outside the State Department.” “He finds that process to be constructive. It informs his thinking. It helps him, he believes, shape policy in the best way possible,” he said. Public opposition And while Blinken was quietly confronted behind closed doors about the administration’s policy toward Gaza on Thursday, members of the administration, including Blinken, have also faced public displays of opposition. A number of protesters have camped in front of Blinken’s house since last Friday to try to pressure a change in policy. At a public speech on Tuesday, Samantha Power, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) was twice confronted about the administration’s position toward Gaza. One questioner, who identified herself as a USAID contractor, asked Power about the loss of the US’ ability “to be moral leaders” due to the “US funded genocide in Gaza.” Another person interrupted her speech to raise the massive humanitarian toll. “It is a devastating situation where not enough resources are getting in, via the Rafah crossing or the Kerem Shalom crossing,” Power said. “And we are working 24/7 to try to dramatically expand the flow of food, medicine, shelter – I mean, so much is needed. But, you know, you have families right now that are living in unimaginable conditions.” “In addition, of course, the greatest loss of life has come from the war itself and from the bombing, and more than 25,000 civilians have been killed. There is not a single call that President Biden makes, or engagement that anybody in the Biden administration does, that doesn’t put the importance of civilian protection and international humanitarian law, at the top of the conversation,” she said. A USAID spokesperson said that “since the start of this conflict, Administrator Power and other Agency leadership have held numerous engagements with staff in the US and at USAID Missions around the world to discuss the US and USAID response to the conflict, offer appreciation for their work, and hear a range of perspectives and concerns.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "In six months, HAP’s new head focused on fixing the health care crisis",
    "text": "listen to this article\nNicole Stallings led the Hospital and HealthSystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) in June by leading a listening tour across the state.\nThe president and CEO said he spent a lot of time with hospital leaders and legislators and found their work articulate.\n“Each CEO talked about workforce shortages, access to health care and financial feasibility,” he said.\nNow nearly six months later, Stallings said HAP will work with all parties to find a solution to the health care crisis.\n“There is a continued shortage of manpower, hence fewer beds are available,” he said.\nEmergency departments are feeling the pressure due to understaffing, lack of access to care, more patients using them and delays in discharge to other hospital departments or appropriate facilities, he said.\nDoctors and nurses are planning to retire in record numbers due to age and the liability environment in the state.\nAnd in rural communities, Stallings said, the financial challenges are “unlike any we’ve seen.”\nThey pointed to the lack of maternal health and behavioral health services.\n“A large number of people come to the emergency department and stay until they get appropriate care,” he said. “Many departments are overwhelmed.”\nAlthough the situation may seem dire, Stallings said he believes there are solutions when all parties work together.\n“I believe there will be increased partnerships between local community organizations, local government, caregivers, and health systems,” he said.\nStallings comes to HAP from the Maryland Hospital Association where she was senior vice president for government affairs and policy.\nRead Also: There is a characteristic of personality that is reflected in gifts; Here we tell you what it is\nPrior to his work at MHA, Stallings was a senior policy analyst for the Maryland Secretary of Health and chief of government relations and special projects at the Maryland Health Care Commission.\n“I bring two decades of experience to Pennsylvania,” she said, adding that the challenges here are being felt across the country.\nLooking ahead, Stallings said HAP will work to create new health care partnerships, advocate to help hospitals meet their challenges and work to grow the workforce, which he said is “certainly of paramount importance.” Is a priority.”\n“Although it is challenging and complex, I am optimistic as we continue to reinvent how care is delivered with innovative care models,” he said. “New models were tested during the height of the pandemic, and they continue to be developed and improved.”\nOnce the new models are successful, Stallings said they can be shared with other systems in Pennsylvania and regionally. And through regional cooperation, successful programs elsewhere can also be shared here.\nThe work will start with developing the workforce. Stallings said the loss is being felt across the board.\nAs physicians get older, Stallings said one thing we need to pay attention to is so-called “venue shopping.”\n“We have the worst liability environment in our country and we are a net exporter of doctors,” he said.\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court in August 2022 eliminated a rule that required liability cases to be heard in the same jurisdiction where they occurred. The change came into effect from January 1, 2023.\nStallings said that since many physicians trained in Pennsylvania have decided to leave the state, returning to “situation shopping” would create more temptation for them to leave.\n“This hurts our ability to recruit not only physicians, but nurses as well,” he said.\nAlthough nursing and allied health worker programs are growing through partnerships, many of which cover the cost of tuition, Stallings said the move is necessary to recruit and retain personnel.\nAlthough Stallings said it will take time, the programs will fill not only the nursing, physician and allied health care workforce, but support staff as well.\nOne example is the partnership with Penn State Health and HACC where Penn State covers 100% of the tuition for medical assistants and phlebotomists in exchange for one year of employment.\nAt the high school level, The MedCerts Healthcare Training Program, a partnership between Mechanicsburg-based Emerge Education, Cumberland Valley School District and UPMC, offers programs in allied health care and health IT for rising high school students through 10th grade. . UPMC offers clinics in areas including medical assistants, phlebotomists, sterile processing technicians and pharmacy technologists.\nIn the Lehigh Valley, Lehigh Career & Technical Institute, Lehigh Valley Health Network, Penn State Lehigh Valley and Lehigh Carbon Community College are partnering to offer a dual enrollment program for high school seniors interested in health care careers .\nThese are just a few, Stallings said.\nThe partnership will help care teams grow. While the registered nursing degree takes time, other certifications can be obtained more quickly, Stallings said. Those people can work alongside RNs, giving them more time to complete tasks that require their skill level.\nVirtual nursing can also help. Stallings said virtual nursing can help discharge patients in one place.\n“Nurses from other parts of the state, country or even the world can follow discharge instructions with patients, freeing up local staff,” she said.\nThe recently partially passed Nurse Licensure Compact is also helping. She said the state has allowed nurses licensed in other states to practice in Pennsylvania, which will increase the pool.\nAnother thing that would help, she said, is if work visas would be more easily available to nurses from other countries.\n“It will take years to reach this scale,” he said. “In the short term, we need to innovate so we can provide quality care during emergencies.”\nTo help hospitals’ financial viability, Stallings said policy changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are needed. This includes things like psychotherapy, psychology and social work services and outpatient services.\n“This will keep a lot of people out of the ER,” she said.\n“We applaud the movement at the federal level to stop the Medicare cuts,” he said. “We are very focused on Medicaid and that puts financial pressure on hospitals, especially those hospitals that have a higher population on Medicaid.”\nRecognizing reimbursement is always a difficult issue, Stallings said, “This administration recognizes the need to ensure people have access to care.”\n(TagstoTranslate)Access to health care(T)Financial viability of health care systems(T)Health care(T)Hospital and HealthSystem Association of Pennsylvania(T)Nicole Stallings(T)President and CEO(T)Workforce",

    "title": "From Life Saving to Life changing: Honoring all K9 Veterans Through the Story of Cento",
    "text": "MISAWA, Japan - As K9 Veterans Day approaches, we’re reminded of the tireless dedication and unwavering loyalty of our Military Working Dogs (MWDs) and the selfless service they execute in coordination with our Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, and Guardians. Among these heroes, one story stands out – a tale of resilience, compassion, lifesaving, and the unbreakable bond between a dedicated animal care specialist and her new family member.\nThe U.S. Army Veterinary Corps is responsible for the healthcare of all MWDs across all DoD installations. For Sergeant Joanna Bernardo, caring for MWDs isn’t just a job: it’s a calling. Her connection with retired MWD Cento transcends duty, leading to life-saving care and a newfound bond that changed both of their lives forever.\n\"My primary role revolves around ensuring the health and welfare of these remarkable animals as they serve our country,\" says Bernardo, a 68T Animal Care Specialist at Misawa Air Base, Japan. \"And when the unexpected happens, knowing that our training and skills can make a difference, that's truly rewarding.\"\nCento, an Air Force retired MWD with accolades for drug detection and patrol work during his service, faced a crisis when he arrived at Bernardo’s care with uncontrolled bleeding from his nose. Rushing into the Misawa Air Base Veterinary Treatment Facility at 10:00 p.m. and working tirelessly for eight long and harrowing hours, Bernardo fought to stabilize him, drawing on her training and competencies to keep him alive until a veterinarian arrived. “It was a test of everything I’ve learned,” recalls Bernardo. “Seeing him pull through strengthened our bond, and he was just the sweetest and most gentle dog through all of it.”\nDespite the lifesaving care, Cento could not continue to perform his duties to standard, ultimately ending his time in service.\nThe MWD retirement and adoption process is a collaborative effort between the Kennels and Army Veterinarians. When either team notices that the dog is no longer able to perform their duties to standard, they initiate the process. Additionally, the MWD must undergo an adoption suitability review process through the Veterinarian Team. “All MWDs are reviewed, and their history is examined to ensure their behavior, temperament, and health is all taken into account” explains Bernardo.\nBernardo reflects on her initial hesitation, acknowledging the unique challenges of adopting a retired working dog and having a five-year-old son at the time. \"These dogs have spent their lives in service, often with limited exposure to family life or interaction with children and other pets,\" she says. \"It's crucial to ensure a smooth transition into a domestic environment.\"\nStill, she couldn't deny the connection they shared. \"He's such a sweet, gentle bear,\" she affectionately describes him, \"and I knew he deserved a loving home.\"\nAs Cento's retirement loomed, Bernardo faced a decision that would change both their lives forever.\nThe journey to adopting Cento was both a leap of faith as well as a carefully orchestrated process. Typically, an MWD’s previous handlers are the first in line to adopt their retired MWD, but in this case Bernardo’s strong bond, and proximity were enough to put her first in line for adoption. “Cento’s handlers live far from here now, but they saw the bond we formed and they understood the care and attention I’d be able to provide to him and ultimately saw that we were a good fit to be a part of each other’s lives,” Bernardo explains.\nBefore committing to adoption, Bernardo took proactive steps to introduce Cento to her family and assess his compatibility. \"I brought my son to the clinic to meet Cento and gauge his reaction,\" she recalls. \"Additionally, my husband and I spent time with him to understand his temperament and needs.\"\nWith careful introductions and patience, Cento seamlessly transitioned into Bernardo’s family, winning over her son and husband with his gentle nature. \"He's not just a retired working dog; he's a cherished member of our family,\" said Bernardo.\nTheir days are now filled with leisurely walks, treat hide-and-seek, and plenty of belly rubs. \"He may be retired, but he still loves his treats and morning walks,\" Bernardo says with a smile. \"My husband and Cento are becoming famous for their morning walks at the flight line together, and just seeing him enjoy the simple pleasures of retired life bring us a lot of joy.”\nCento also enjoys plenty of visits with his former handlers, where he continues to bring laugher and smiles and reminding everyone the importance of honoring these unsung heroes. \"They deserve love and care in their retirement,\" Bernardo emphasizes, \"just like any other veteran.\"\nThe decision to adopt Cento wasn’t just about welcoming a furry companion into their lives, it was about honoring service and ensuring his best care in retirement. \"These dogs have dedicated their lives to keeping us safe,\" Bernardo emphasizes. \"Now, it's our turn to show them the love and care they deserve.\"\n|Date Taken:||03.10.2024|\n|Date Posted:||03.10.2024 14:05|\n|Story ID:||465843|\n|Location:||JP|\n|Web Views:||4|\n|Downloads:||0|\nThis work, From Life Saving to Life changing: Honoring all K9 Veterans Through the Story of Cento, by\n[Kathryne Gest](/portfolio/1746408/kathryne-gest), identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.",

    "text": "La mantilla y todo el look que se desarrolla en torno a la misma están irremediablemente asociados a la Semana Santa como símbolo de respeto y luto por la muerte de Cristo. No es difícil conseguir un outfit perfecto, tan sólo hay que seguir unas sencillas pautas.\nEl cabello de la mujer se recogerá en un sencillo moño de bailarina a media altura. Sobre éste se dispondrán dos peinas entrelazadas que servirán de base para insertar la peineta ¡Ojo! ¡Cuánto más finos tenga los dientes, mejor!\nSobre la peineta disponemos la mantilla (normalmente de blonda), que podemos dejar caer hasta media cabeza o bien retirar hacia atrás y dejarla por completo despejada. La fijamos con un par de horquillas invisibles a ambos lados de la cabeza.\nRecogemos la mantilla hacia atrás y la fijamos -haciendo tres o cuatro pliegues- con el broche.\nLa mujer de mantilla lleva pendientes de perlas o en tonos plateados -de plata, rodio, oro blanco o platino- en forma de lágrima y no demasiado grandes. Igualmente, su maquillaje debe ser discreto: funcionan muy bien las sombras de ojos en degradados ahumados y el eyeliner negro¡, realzado por una buena máscara de pestaña. Para los labios, cualquier color que sea natural y con un toque satinado pero no brillante.\nEn cuanto al vestido, es preceptivo el Petite Robe Noir, o lo que es lo mismo, un vestido negro de cóctel, de líneas sencillas con cuello de barco o a la caja. Pocas optan por escote en V, aunque no demasiado pronunciado. La manga ha de ser larga o francesa.\nSe admiten los guantes negros -ya sean de raso o terciopelo- o calados y rosario.\nLas medias siempre son negras y no demasiado tupidas. Las de cristal aportan un toque más glamouroso.\nEn lo que respecta a los zapatos, se imponen los salones negros -con tacón medio o alto- o peeptoe negro, si las temperaturas son muy elevadas. Y no, no se suele llevar bolso. Aunque... si no nos queda más más remedio, lo mejor será elegir uno negro de pequeño tamaño y líneas muy sencillas en formato cartera y con pulsera; o bien alguno que pueda colgarse al hombro ¡Nunca en bandolera!",

    "text": "Tres personas sospechosas de preparar atentados contra iglesias y sinagogas en Turquía han sido detenidas dentro de una operación donde han sido arrestadas también otras 29 que se cree tienen contactos con círculos yihadistas y estaban implicados en esos planes. Una operación simultánea en nueve provincias turcas, coordinada por la policía junto a los servicios secretos (MIT), permitió detener a esas tres personas, supuestamente dirigentes de las redes del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico, o Daesh, en Turquía, informa este viernes la agencia oficialista Anadolu. La emisora pública turca TRT los identifica como Miybel el Shuweihi y Mohamed Hilaf Ibrahim, conocido como Abu Leis, sospechosos de preparar atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en Turquía. El tercero sería Iheb Alani, que se cree estaba coordinando un ataque contra la embajada iraquí en Turquía, agrega la citada emisora. Además, las fuerzas de seguridad han detenido a otras 29 personas sospechosas de estar vinculadas a las redes yihadistas en Turquía. Hace una semana, la Policía detuvo a 304 personas bajo sospecha de mantener lazos con las células del Estado Islámico. Desde el atentado contra la discoteca Reina en Estambul en la Nochevieja de 2016, en la que un yihadista mató con un arma automática a 39 personas, las autoridades turca extreman la vigilancia en estas fechas. Aunque la Nochevieja se celebra popularmente en Turquía y no falta decoración navideña, algunos predicadores radicales se han pronunciado contra estas festividades por \"cristianas\" o \"paganas\". Desde el atentado contra el Reina, Turquía, que en 2016-2017 llevó a cabo una operación militar contra el Estado Islámico en el norte de Siria, no ha vuelto a sufrir atentados atribuidos al yihadismo.
