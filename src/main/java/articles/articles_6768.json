    "text": "Huawei contra el veto de EEUU: ¿Conseguirá que su chip de IA llegue en 2025 pese a las limitaciones tecnológicas?\nA pesar de las estrictas sanciones impuestas por Estados Unidos, Huawei está lista para iniciar la producción masiva de su nuevo chip de inteligencia artificial. ¿Conseguirá cumplir con la fecha y estar a la altura de grandes como Meta u OpenAI?\nComputerHoy\nAyer ya se anunció a bombo y platillo: Huawei planea iniciar la producción en masa de su nuevo chip de [inteligencia artificial](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/reportajes/tecnologia/inteligencia-artificial-469917), el Ascend 910C, en el primer trimestre de 2025. No cabe duda de que se trata de un proyecto muy ambicioso que llega en un momento en el que se podría decir que la IA ha sido la gran protagonista de 2024 y gigantes como [OpenAI](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tecnologia/todo-openai-nacimiento-chatgpt-creacion-ia-iguale-ser-humano-1404952), [Amazon y Meta ya están desarrollando sus propios chips](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/amazon/amazon-lanzara-propios-chips-dejar-depender-nvidia-1418392) para reducir la dependencia de [Nvidia](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tecnologia/todo-nvidia-fabricante-tarjetas-graficas-ha-conquistado-mundo-ia-1402583).\nSin embargo, este camino hacia la producción masiva parece que no va a ser precisamente de rosas. Las restricciones impuestas por Estados Unidos han limitado por completo el acceso de Huawei a tecnología avanzada de fabricación de chips.\nComo resultado, esto va a afectar al rendimiento del Ascend 910C, con una eficiencia de solo el 20%, muy por debajo del 70% considerado comercialmente viable en la industria.\n¿La principal barrera para Huawei? La falta de acceso a la tecnología de litografía ultravioleta extrema (EUV) de ASML, clave para la fabricación de los chips más top. Además, las nuevas restricciones del gobierno de Biden también han limitado el acceso de China a las máquinas de litografía ultravioleta profunda (DUV) más avanzadas.\nHuawei podría demostrar que está a la altura en esta competitiva carrera por la IA\nPese a todo esto, ¿conseguirá cumplir con la fecha estimada? Probablemente sí. Sin embargo, ya puedes ver que poco puede competir si se compara con los grandes. Aun así, [Huawei](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tecnologia/todo-huawei-empresa-tecnologica-china-estados-unidos-ha-vetado-varias-ocasiones-1398225) va con todo. Según Bloomberg, la empresa no solo está desarrollando el Ascend 910C, sino también otro chip de IA, ambos basados en una arquitectura de 7 nanómetros.\nLo cierto es que este gran esfuerzo también se enmarca en un contexto de búsqueda de autosuficiencia tecnológica por parte de China. El gobierno chino lo ha invertido casi todo en el sector de semiconductores, con un fondo de casi 48.000 millones de dólares establecido en mayo para impulsar la industria.\nLa apuesta de Huawei no cabe duda de que es arriesgada, pero potencialmente podría traer grandes noticias. Si logra superar las limitaciones tecnológicas y producir chips de IA a la altura, podría no solo fortalecer su posición en el mercado chino, sino también poner contra las cuerdas el dominio global de empresas como Nvidia en el campo de la IA.\nSin embargo, que se vayan preparando porque con la vuelta de Donald Trump a la Casa Blanca en enero, es probable que las restricciones sobre la tecnología china aumenten.\nConoce [cómo trabajamos](/como-trabajamos) en ComputerHoy.\nEtiquetas: [Smartphones](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tags/smartphones), [NVIDIA](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tags/nvidia), [Leyes](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tags/leyes), [Inteligencia artificial](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tags/inteligencia-artificial), [Estados Unidos](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tags/estados-unidos), [Hardware](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tags/hardware)",

    "title": "How to make Michael Twitty’s matzoh ball gumbo, a soup of Black and Jewish cuisines",
    "text": "Danielle Dorsey | Los Angeles Times (TNS)\nLOS ANGELES — With a rainbow knitted kippah affixed to the crown of his head, Michael Twitty is paced and intentional as he moves through the test kitchen at the L.A. Times. He’s here to make one of his classic Passover dishes, matzoh ball gumbo, which combines two recipes from his food memoir “ Koshersoul .”\nThe crimson stew adds buoyant, scallion-studded matzoh balls to a heartening okra gumbo, joining two staple dishes from Jewish and Black Southern cuisines. Chicken broth and diced tomatoes lend the finished gumbo their umami, with a Creole spice blend that imparts a gentle, humming heat.\nTwitty, who hails from the Washington, D.C., area, says he’s always wanted to winter in Los Angeles. He’s been living at the junction of Beverly Hills, Pico-Robertson and West Hollywood since November and, following a short trip back to the East Coast in March, plans to stay through June.\n“Koshersoul,” by Michael W. Twitty. (HarperCollins Publishers/TNS) After hosting a conversation at chef Martin Draluck’s Black Pot Supper Club series in February, Twitty will take over the kitchen at Baldwin Hills’ Post & Beam restaurant with his “Koshersoul” dinner pop-up on Wednesday, May 15. The evening will include back-to-back dinners with recipes from the book. The first service will lean into Twitty’s Jewish background with West African brisket and peach rice kugel, as well as matzoh ball gumbo. The second will embrace a cookout vibe with the same brisket plus barbecue chicken and lamb (all of the meat will be kosher), baked beans and collard green lox wraps.\n“Koshersoul,” the follow up to his James Beard Award-winning “The Cooking Gene: A Journey Through African American Culinary History,” details Twitty’s journey as a Black, gay and Jewish man and draws meaningful links between Afro-Atlantic and global Jewish culinary practices, including the contributions of Jews of color. It was named the 2023 book of the year at the National Jewish Book Awards, making Twitty the first Black author to win the distinction. Currently, Twitty is working on a cookbook with essential recipes from the American South and has plans to write another food memoir and history that will serve as a queer journey through the culinary world.\nHe credits food historian Marcie Cohen Ferris for inspiring the matzoh ball gumbo recipe. Published in 2010, Ferris’ book “ Matzoh Ball Gumbo ” explores the historic foodways of Southern Jews, including the influence of Black Southerners and Black women in particular.\n“When I make this dish, I’m thinking how can we connect to that past and history, and recount the people who were often nameless?” says Twitty. He says that for European Jews assimilating in the Deep South in the early and mid 20th century, food, often prepared by Black domestic workers, was a conduit for belonging.\nRather than a blending or “fusion” of culinary styles, Twitty sees his matzoh ball gumbo as an act of preservation. It’s a continuation of Southern food stories, highlighting the traditions that extend across the African and Jewish diasporas.\n“You can compare it to soup and dumplings from Jamaica, or omo tuo from Ghana,” he says. “In West and Central Africa, the main meal is often a soup, sauce or stew with a starch — sauce and fufu, sauce and banku, sauce and millet or rice balls. There are so many parallels there.”\nHe continues, saying that, “Jewish tradition is extremely fluid and flexible. We eat foods that have their roots in very ancient ideas, but bear very little resemblance to their original concept.”\nTwitty begins by methodically chopping the herbs and vegetables for his gumbo and matzoh balls: parsley, green onions, garlic and the “holy trinity” of onion, celery and bell pepper.\nNext, he makes the dough for the matzoh balls. Cooking alongside Twitty reminds me of sharing kitchen space with my late great-grandmother Madea, a born-and-raised Mississippian. Like her, he measures in pinches, makes last-minute adjustments (such as substituting salt for baking powder in the matzoh ball dough) and gives a deep, satisfied grunt when his taste-testing yields the desired results.\nOnce the matzoh ball dough is finished, Twitty seals the bowl with plastic wrap and puts it in the refrigerator to rest.\nAs he slices the okra into razon-thin rounds, our conversation winds from the Yiddish words for matzoh ball and Passover (kneidlach and Pesach, respectively) to his experiences traveling to Italy and various countries in West Africa.\nWe’re weeks away from Passover, but the atmosphere feels similar to a Seder Twitty might host. The conversation is peppered with laughter, and topics that are usually avoided at the dinner table — namely, religion and politics — are met with curiosity and understanding. Such discussions, Twitty says, are integral to the spirit of Passover. He describes a long history of Seders that supported early labor movements, women’s rights and Black and Jewish liberation.\n“It’s exactly what Pesach is supposed to do, which is open those gates of liberation and lack of constraints to the rest of humanity,” he says. “It can be both an origin story moment for the Jewish people, and a human liberation story for all of mankind. It was always meant to be that way.”\nTwitty pauses to give the roux his full attention. He stirs slowly, peeking into the deep-bottomed pot to gauge its progress. The potato starch that he uses instead of flour takes longer to brown, about 15 minutes. Twitty dips a spoon in to taste; his throaty purr tells us that it’s ready for more broth.\nAfter adding the cooked vegetables, tomatoes, okra, thyme and Creole seasoning, we let the concoction simmer and turn our attention back to the matzoh balls. We fill a large pot with salted water and wait for it to reach a rolling boil. Twitty shapes the dough into walnut-sized spheres.\nOne by one, the matzoh balls get dropped into the pot with boiling water. In a departure from the recipe in his book, Twitty takes them out early and transfers them to the gumbo, where he lets them simmer under a lid for an additional 15 minutes.\nFinally, we ladle the gumbo into bowls, at least two or three matzoh balls per serving. The okra retains a pleasant crunch and the matzoh balls are savory, a persuasive replacement for rice or even chicken. Someone notes the rare silence that has befallen the kitchen — this gumbo is good.\nThere are several of us in the kitchen, and Twitty’s gumbo speaks to different parts of each of our heritages. For me, the okra and tomato-rich broth recalls my maternal Mississippi roots, while the matzoh balls take someone else back to childhood experiences making them alongside their Bubbe.\n“We have to remember that we co-created the Southern culture with Indigenous people, with white people, with immigrants from all over the world,” Twitty says. “And all of those stories have to be told for it to be a true, full and honest recounting of how we got here, and what mistakes we should refuse to make going forward.”\n©2024 Los Angeles Times.

    "title": "Alice Parker, whose musical compositions were ‘food for the soul,’ dies at 98 - The Boston Globe",
    "text": "Early in her musical career, when Alice Parker was composing and arranging for the Robert Shaw Chorale in New York City, the melodies she crafted seemed to magically transform into the performers who would sing each string of notes.\n“I got to the point that I would sit down to write a solo for one of the people in the chorale, and the piece of paper I was composing on would become transparent,” she said in a 2017 interview with The Resonance Project. “I could actually see the singer singing the line. I was composing for a specific person, sound, and personality.”\nAdvertisement\nA prolific composer of choral music, and a conductor and teacher as well, Ms. Parker spent more than 75 years providing artistic nourishment to performers and audiences alike.\n“Music is exactly like food,” she told Resonance Project founder Jonathan Dimmock. “You have to compose for the people around you, the same way you’d cook for the people around you. Music is food for the soul — not just the mind, nor just the heart.”\n Ms. Parker, who completed her 2020 choral composition “On the Common Ground” in response to the world’s divisive strife, died Dec. 24 in her home in Hawley, to which she had moved full time at 70 and where she ran her Melodious Accord project.\nShe was 98 and her health had recently failed quickly, though up to the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 she was still traveling and leading seminars for musicians.\nComposing on commission, she created hundreds of musical pieces that included cantatas and choral suites, song cycles, and full orchestral settings for choruses.\n“From 1948 to 1968 she worked closely with the late Robert Shaw, doing a lot of un- or under-credited arranging for all those Robert Shaw Chorale recordings on RCA that an entire generation seems to have grown up with — ‘With Love From a Chorus,’ ‘Sea Shanties,’ ‘Sing to the Lord,’ and more,” the Globe’s Richard Buell wrote in 2000.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s fair to say,” he added, “that Parker has even had a say in what a lot of Americans think a chorus ought to sound like.”\nAs a woman in a what was a male-dominated pursuit more than seven decades ago, Ms. Parker often encountered gender bias in how her work was acknowledged.\nIn 1995 , Leslie Kandell noted in The New York Times that “when Alice Parker was working for the Robert Shaw Chorale, her name would appear in parentheses: ‘Haydn’s “Creation” (translated by Alice Parker),’ say, or ‘Folk songs conducted by Robert Shaw (arranged by Alice Parker).’ ”\nDuring the past four decades, however, Ms. Parker was at the forefront of her endeavors, particularly after founding Melodious Accord in Hawley. The town had been her home away from home since childhood before she moved there for good in 1995.\nThrough Melodious Accord, she invited composers, conductors, and song leaders to weeklong seminars in Hawley, where they cooked for one another and ended the week with a community sing at a local church.\n“Melody is an unparalleled means of communication for human beings,” Ms. Parker said on the organization’s website.\nChoral music, she said in an interview for the ArtsHub of Western Mass website, provides a “kind of mind cleansing. You forget the struggles of the day and enter into the experience. The incredible thing is that this is right there for the taking, all the time. You don’t have to have studied. You don’t have to know anything. The smallest children, even babies, join in.”\nAdvertisement\nBorn in Boston on Dec. 16, 1925, Alice Parker was the second of five siblings and grew up in Winchester.\nHer father, Gordon Parker, was in his family’s business importing mahogany.\nMs. Parker’s mother, Mary Shumate Stuart Parker, prepared school inspection reports in South Carolina before marrying. In Massachusetts, she helped start a laminate company that made propellers for military planes decades ago, among other products.\nIn 1920, Gordon purchased the land in Hawley that became Singing Brook Farm.\n“I think I was 4 months old the first time I came here, and it has always felt like home to me,” Ms. Parker told ArtsHub.\nAt Smith College, she majored in composition, and then switched to majoring in organ upon realizing that she wasn’t fond of that era’s prevailing interest in 12-tone pieces, which generally dispense with Western music’s conventional hierarchy and distinction between consonant and dissonant intervals.\nHer many honors and awards include receiving the Smith Medal in 2014 . She was also featured in a Heritage Film Project documentary.\nMs. Parker received a master’s in choral conducting from The Juilliard School, and her association with the Robert Shaw Chorale proved rewarding professionally and personally.\nAdvertisement\nThomas Floyd Pyle was a professional singer, a baritone with the chorale who also ran a choral contracting agency in New York City. His work was so essential to the choral scene that singers arriving in the city were often encouraged to “go audition for Tommy Pyle,” the Times reported in 1964 .\nHe and Ms. Parker married in 1954 and soon had five children.\nThey had “a very strong marriage,” said their daughter Molly Stejskal of Wyncote, Pa. “She had said that both of them agreed that it was important for her to be able to continue to pursue her career, and not just be a stay-at-home mom.”\nWhen Mr. Pyle died of a heart attack in 1976 , Ms. Parker, at 50, became a single mother to her children.\nShe continued to carve out time in a section of their New York apartment to compose on a slanted desk, its surface large enough to accommodate musical scores.\n“At the same time, she was there for us,” Molly said. “So we just learned that when she was doing her music, we needed to let her be and we would have her attention later.”\nThe family will hold a private service for Ms. Parker, who, in addition to Molly, leaves two sons, David Pyle of Salem and Timothy Pyle of Powhatan, Va.; two other daughters, Katharine Bryda of South Hadley and Elizabeth Pyle of Amherst; a sister, Mary Stuart Cosby of Christiansburg, Va.; 11 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.\nAdvertisement",
