    "text": "PROSPECT, Ohio — An Ohio tradition going back 35 years takes place at the end of the month in Columbus: the Arnold Sports Festival , named after bodybuilder and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nThe event draws about 12,000 athletes from 80 countries, competing in more than 50 events, from bodybuilding to girls' gymnastics. Among them, competitors from all over Ohio, from small towns like Prospect, where a weightlifter named Corey Makowski has been training for months to compete in the World’s Strongest Firefighter event.\nWhat You Need To Know It's the 35th year for the Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus\nProspect firefighter Corey Makowski will compete in the World's Strongest Firefighter event\nThe Arnold Sports Festival draws 12,000 athletes competing in more than 50 events Makowski is both a professional firefighter for the nearby city of Marion and he is a lieutenant for the volunteer Battle Run Fire District in Prospect.\nMakowski converted his home garage into a gym. He’s lifted weights for years, but he’s still pretty new to the sport of strong man.\n“Scrolling through YouTube, I came across the episode of the show from the History Channel, ‘History’s Strongest Men’ and there was an episode of when they were pulled the Dinnie Stones in Scotland, which are famous lifting stones. I thought, ‘Hey, they can pick up rocks and I can pick up rocks, too.’”\nHe went to his family farm to make his own version of the Dinnie Stones.\n“I went to the rock pile there and grab two of the heaviest stones that I could pick up at the time,” he said. “One of them’s 171 pounds. The other 183. I drilled a hole in the top and attached handles.”\nHe’s spent more time working with the stones this year than last, when it was his first time competing at The Arnold.\n“Last year was a bit rough. I did not prepare as well as should have,” Makowski said. “I ended up in last place. The guys that are in contention for the title are on a whole different level than I am.”\nBut he says it’s still fun to compete.\n“It’s a really cool community because everybody is telling you how to be better, even though they’re in direct competition against you.”\nCompeting is not just a flex of strength. It helps Makowski train for his day job too.\n“When I put all my gear on, plus the air pack carrying tools and I’m walking into a fire at approximately 350 pounds once I have all my gear on,” he said.\nMakowski weighs about 280 and the gear weighs an additional 70 pounds.\n“The movements in Strongman are very similar to what we have to do on the day-to-day job,” he said. “A lot of our runs are for injury lift assists, which is just helping people off the floor. And it could be anybody from 98-pound grandma to 550-pound bariatric patients.”\nMakowski is the third generation working as a firefighter in Ohio.\n“My grandpa got on Marion City Fire after getting home from Vietnam. My dad started in 1990, I believe, and he actually just retired. It’s kind of a family tradition at this point.”\nHe’s starting a new tradition with his boy Eli, competing in Strongman.\n“My dad’s strong, he’s going to do great,” Eli said.\nThe four-year-old is also strong. He’s already competed in a kid strength competition and won his division.\n“My son walks up to me afterwards, and he says, ‘Dad, this is the first time I’ve done one and I won. How come every time we come, you lose?’ And that was a bit of a kick in the gut,” Makowski said.\nBut he tells his son competing at the Arnold’s about more than medals and trophies.\n“The coolest part of it for me is I now talk to guys in France, England, all over the U.S. I love the networking aspect of it.”\nAll brought together by the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n“Everybody that’s going there feels that they are near the top of what they are capable of, otherwise they wouldn’t go put it on display. He’s enabled us to have that platform to go there.” From gyms, firehouses and garages all over Ohio and the world.\nThe Arnold Sports Festival runs from Feb. 29 to March 3.",

The findings highlight the need to tackle social inequalities and environmental pollution together to improve the health of disadvantaged populations.\nDec 19, 2024, 1:06:55 PM\nChristine Vollgraf\n, Deutsches Zentrum für Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung e.V.\nThe study, conducted in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, analysed data from 507 people in the US. It looked at the relationship between social status, traffic noise and cardiovascular disease. The results are alarming: people with low incomes who were also exposed to high levels of traffic noise had more than a fivefold increased risk of major cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, compared to people without these stressors. Traffic noise and social disadvantage - a dangerous combination The study showed for the first time that the combination of social disadvantage and traffic noise increases stress responses in the brain and promotes inflammatory processes in the arteries. This so-called \"neuro-arterial axis\" is a central mechanism by which environmental and social stressors work together to impair cardiovascular health. Environmental justice and health promotion as key demands \"The results clearly show that environmental factors such as noise disproportionately affect disadvantaged populations,\" explains Omar Hahad, DZHK researcher at the University Medical Centre Mainz and co-author of the study.\" To reduce social health inequalities, policies to promote environmental justice and address social disadvantage need to be closely linked\". The study emphasises that reducing noise exposure and promoting social justice are crucial to improving cardiovascular health in particularly vulnerable populations.Policy and public health initiatives should focus more on this double burden. The findings have been published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology. The research was carried out in collaboration with the German Centre for Cardiovascular Research, Harvard Medical School and other international partners.\nContact for scientific information:\nOriginal Publication:\nSource:\n[https://idw-online.de/de/news845124](https://idw-online.de/de/news845124)",

Follow on X LONDON -- The debate over whether Arsenal can handle a Premier League title run-in just grew louder.\nAfter falling short last season despite holding an eight-point lead at the beginning of April, the principal challenge this time around for manager Mikel Arteta was evolving the Gunners into a more robust proposition to last the pace.\nThere had been clear signs of progress in that regard this season, but the manner of Thursday's 2-0 defeat to West Ham will spark familiar questions about whether Arsenal can triumph in what is threatening to be a multiway fight to be champions.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Ranking the faves in all of Europe's competitions\nA row will continue over the opening goal given the ball may have drifted out of play as Jarrod Bowen pulled it back for Tomás Soucek to score after 13 minutes. VAR official Craig Pawson took a long look but no camera angle could conclusively overturn the on-field decision and a goal was awarded.\nRegardless, Arsenal lacked the composure associated with serial title-winners. Their defending -- which led to Gabriel Magalhaes hitting the ball against Oleksandr Zinchenko to give Bowen a chance to pounce -- was calamitous on the first goal. Their response in possession was even more troubling. Wasting chances at one end and conceding another soft goal at the other was a recipe for disaster.\nThe pre-match talk of a summer signing coming back to haunt his former club came to pass but not in the manner anyone expected. This ended up being a night to forget for Declan Rice as ex-Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos scored his first Premier League goal with an excellent 55th-minute header.\nEditor's Picks Watchability Index: Ranking the most entertaining teams, games in Europe with cold hard stats 1d Bill Connelly LaLiga's bests so far: From Jude Bellingham to Girona, Griezmann and more 1d Sid Lowe January transfers that could cause chaos: Mbappé to Madrid, more 5d Jon Molyneux-Carter 2 Related After excelling for his new club time and again this season, Rice endured the taunts of West Ham fans for the final 20 minutes or so here as a result of his £105 million summer move to Emirates Stadium. Rice's form has been a big factor in Arsenal's apparent evolution but, in a moment that perfectly encapsulated their regression here, he gave away a penalty in stoppage time, bringing arguably the biggest cheer of the night from the away end. Few seemed to care that David Raya saved substitute Saïd Benrahma 's spot kick as the final whistle came seconds later.\nArteta has rightly praised the home atmosphere in recent times, given the transformation from the toxic disconnect that provided the soundtrack to the end of Arsene Wenger's time in charge -- but there was a tension in the air against the Hammers that did not dissipate all evening.\nThere wasn't the maturity in Arsenal's play that we have come to expect, perhaps most obviously evidenced by their play in the final third. Gabriel Jesus headed the ball over on 66 minutes and Martin Odegaard forced Alphonse Areola into a fine save at the end, but there was little else of note despite registering 77 touches in West Ham's box -- the most on record since 2008-09 in a single Premier League match for a team who failed to score.\nBukayo Saka (who hit the post in the first half), Emile Smith Rowe and Eddie Nketiah all registered shots on target in the final 12 minutes but none of them required anything other than a simple stop by Areola. Arteta, however, believed they created enough to win the game.\n\"When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing,\" Arteta said. \"But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30, I don't know how many touches in the box, how many situations, how many opportunities to score and we haven't done it. In football you have to do that better if you want to win.\n\"It's what it is. We have to try to generate. If we don't score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That's the only thing. I can't imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today though, it wasn't enough to win the game.\"\nAfter West Ham United scored a second goal, Arsenal players -- including Martin Odegaard, center -- were visibly shell-shocked. Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Their failure in front of goal will also only strengthen the argument a new striker is needed in January.\n\"All we have is the players we have, the players I love the most,\" said Arteta. \"What we have to do is try to get better situations, more training, raise the confidence and that's it. They've done it [before].\"\nWest Ham and manager David Moyes continue to defy expectations. After winning last season's Europa Conference League and selling Rice for a club-record fee, they now find themselves in sixth place on 33 points, the highest figure they have ever collected at this stage of a Premier League season. No wonder Moyes suggested the club is \"getting ready to talk\" about a new contract with his existing deal expiring at the end of the season.\nThursday was West Ham's first win in this fixture since 2015 and, more remarkably, Moyes' first league away win at Arsenal, Chelsea , Liverpool or Manchester United in 73 attempts.\n\"Football is played in many ways and tonight we did the part that maybe isn't talked about as much,\" said Moyes. \"Brilliant defending. We did a good job on Arsenal tonight. They had lots of the ball, too much for my liking, but we did a great job.\"\nAsked about his team's aspirations for 2024, Moyes added: \"We are not one of the top teams. We are trying to get up and grow the team.\"\nArsenal, meanwhile, are in a different place. They believe they can be the top team. But this defeat showed there is more work to do.",

La canciller de Ecuador, Gabriela Sommerfeld, y el embajador de Ecuador en Quito, Keiichiro Morishita, firmaron documento para financiar el proyecto Chachimbiro, el 3 de octubre de 2024. - Foto Cancillería de Ecuador Autor: Redacción Primicias Actualizada: Compartir: La [canciller de Ecuador, Gabriela Sommerfeld, ](https://www.primicias.ec/politica/canciller-gabriela-sommerfeld-pedido-asambleistas-palencia-mexico-80128/)y el embajador de Ecuador en Quito, Keiichiro Morishita, formalizaron este jueves, 3 de octubre de 2024, el contrato para un crédito que bordea los USD 43 millones, que será destinado al proyecto geotérmico Chachimbiro (Imbabura). Según el Gobierno, la firma de este documento viabiliza la diversificación de la matriz energética, con miras a la ejecución de proyectos de energías renovables no convencionales, como la geotermia, en momentos que Ecuador soporta cortes de luz de hasta 12 horas debido al estiaje en las centrales hidroeléctricas. \"Este proyecto geotérmico, ubicado en Imbabura, se ha concebido con el propósito de aprovechar los recursos renovables, en línea con nuestra visión de establecer al Ecuador como una potencia energética regional, en la cual prime la autonomía eléctrica\", sostuvo el ministro de Energía, Antonio Antonio Goncalves. El funcionario aseguró que el proyecto Chachimbiro, con una capacidad proyectada de 50 megavatios, “tiene el potencial de generar un ahorro al país de aproximadamente USD 147.9 millones en los primeros diez años, gracias a la reducción del consumo de combustibles fósiles\". \"El cambio de matriz energética no es una tarea sencilla. Requiere visión, planificación y compromiso. El acceso a nuevas fuentes de energía es clave para alcanzar estos objetivos, y el Proyecto Chachimbiro es una piedra angular en este camino\", concluyó el ministro. El embajador de Japón manifestó que se espera que el proyecto contribuya a la formación de las energías renovables, el desarrollo económico sostenible en el Ecuador y a la mitigación del cambio climático.
