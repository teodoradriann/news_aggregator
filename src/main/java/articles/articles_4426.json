    "text": "Lo informó Aerolíneas Argentinas mediante un comunicado esta noche. El paro en Aerolíneas Argentinas encabezado por Pablo Biró (APLA, pilotos) y Juan Pablo Brey (AAA, tripulantes) provocó 319 cancelaciones y afectará a más de 37 mil pasajeros, según confirmó hoy la compañía estatal mediante un comunicado. La compañía estima que el costo económico de esta medida superará los 2 millones y medio de dólares, producto de la pérdida de ventas y por las multas, compensaciones, hotelería, traslados, comidas y otros gastos derivados del daño directo a pasajeros. Del total de afectados, unas 28 mil personas tenían planeados viajes dentro del país, otras 5.500 a destinos regionales, y las restantes 3.500 vuelos al Caribe, Estados Unidos y Europa. Indicaron en el comunicado que, desde el anuncio de la medida la compañía realizó su máximo esfuerzo por modificar su programación de la manera más eficiente posible, dentro de las restricciones impuestas por los propios gremios, para atenuar el perjuicio que este paro provocará a nuestros pasajeros. En este sentido, señalaron que se reprogramaron vuelos, adelantando y demorando salidas por fuera de la franja de la medida, y se crearon vuelos especiales para redistribuir tráfico afectado. Además, se trabajó con la red de alianzas de Aerolíneas Argentinas para facilitar otras alternativas a las personas que se encontraran en tránsito. “Lamentamos profundamente las molestias provocadas por este paro intempestivo, abusivo y fuera de contexto promocionado por dirigentes gremiales de forma irresponsable. Aerolíneas Argentinas continuará trabajando para seguir ofreciendo un servicio de calidad, confiable y seguro a sus pasajeros”, sostiene el documento difundido esta noche. Información importante para el pasajero Aerolíneas sugiere a quienes tenían vuelos programados durante la duración de la medida estar atentos a las notificaciones en el correo electrónico que hayan informado como contacto en su reserva. En caso de haber realizado su compra en una agencia de turismo, se aconseja consultar por esa vía. Les recomiendan utilizar los canales de autogestión en la aplicación de Aerolíneas Argentinas (disponible en iOS y Android) o vía la web aerolineas.com, donde además encontrarán información sobre otros canales de atenció.",

    "text": "KYIV (Reuters) – Ukraine’s Airborne Assault Troops said on Thursday that three servicemen who Ukrainian prosecutors have said were captured and shot dead by Russian forces this month were members of the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade.\nRussia has yet to comment on the allegation, the second accusation that it has killed prisoners of war leveled against it this month by Ukrainian prosecutors.\nFootage shared on social media of the alleged incident appears to show three unarmed figures collapsing from a stationary position after being fired upon. Reuters could not independently verify the video.\nThe Airborne Assault Troops said unidentified enemy personnel, “acting intentionally, in violation of the laws and customs of war,” had deliberately killed the three men, whom it described as captured members of its 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade.\nIt said their bodies had been removed by Ukrainian authorities from the scene, previously identified as being near the village of Robotyne in Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhzhia region.\nThe Airborne Assault Troops reshared the footage of the incident, marking three men with Ukrainian flags and placing Russian flags next to uniformed figures standing or crouching at two locations on a barren landscape some distance behind the three.\nThe three men are seen on their knees, hands behind their heads. At least two uniformed individuals raise what appear to be weapons from the two Russian-flagged locations and appear to open fire in the direction of the Ukrainians.\nImmediately the three tumble forwards, and a man identified as a Russian soldier approaches them and appears to check for signs of life as they lie on the earth.\n“This is another case of a gross violation by the aggressor country of international humanitarian law regarding the treatment of prisoners of war,” the prosecutor’s office said when it announced its investigation on Wednesday.\nUkraine on Dec. 3 accused Russia of committing a war crime after another video shared on social media appeared to show several soldiers shooting two surrendering military personnel who emerged from a dugout at gunpoint.\nLast March, a captured Ukrainian soldier was seen being shot dead in a video after defiantly saying “Glory to Ukraine,” a phrase that has taken on special significance as a common public greeting since the start of the war.\n(Reporting by Oleksandr Kozhukhar in Kyiv and Elaine Monaghan in Washington; Editing by Rosalba O’Brien)",

    "text": "Boeing workers overwhelmingly vote to strike, reject contract\nEducation is Your Right!\nDon’t Let Social Norms Hold You Back. Learn Online with TUKO. Enroll Now!\nBoeing workers in the Seattle region overwhelmingly voted to strike Thursday, spurning a contract the embattled aviation giant characterized as a boon for manufacturing staff given the company's stressed financial condition.\nHourly workers rejected the contract with a vote of 94.6 percent and to strike with 96 percent, said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751.\n\"Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,\" said Holden, who represents about 33,000 workers in the Pacific Northwest. \"We strike at midnight.\"\nA strike will shutter two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region and sideline some 33,000 workers.\nThursday's vote marks a decisive rejection of a deal that line workers said was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives, marking the latest show of defiance by unions following earlier strikes in the auto,\nentertainment and other industries.\nLed by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, Boeing had hoped a 25-percent wage hike over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound region would avert a costly strike as the company struggles to right the ship.\nOrtberg argued in a message to staff that the general wage hike marked the largest in history and that a strike \"would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.\"\nBut rank-and-file workers reacted with fury to the agreement, which was initially backed by IAM leadership.\n'Hollow' commitments\nWorkers had sought a 40 percent wage hike and critics have said the 25 percent figure is inflated because the new deal also eliminates an annual company bonus.\nOther points of contention include the deal's failure to restore a\npension, as well as a Boeing pledge to build its next plane in the Seattle region, which critics view as a \"hollow\" commitment to the region because it offers no promises beyond the four-year contract.\n\"They're talking about a 25 percent increase and it's not,\" said Paul Janousek, an electrician in Everett who voted to strike after concluding Boeing's spin was \"misleading.\"\nJanousek, 55, who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, figures his raise is only about nine percent after Boeing dropped the annual bonus.\nSome workers also expressed anger about Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun, two former CEOs who received multi-million dollar compensation even as the company faced turmoil upon their departure.\n\"Striking isn't ideal, but it's for the best for your long-term well being,\" said Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic who has been at Boeing for six months.\nPhilbin said he will work side\njobs if a strike drags out, but that he and his wife have been holding off on having kids until the situation stabilizes.\n\"(Boeing) is a huge company, they can survive paying the people who do the work a little more,\" he said.\nBig impact from strike?\nThe IAM has a history of striking, with the most recent stoppage in 2008 lasting 57 days.\nHolden has said he initially backed the deal as the best that could be achieved without striking.\nBut the \"real power\" in the union resides with the workers, according to Holden who said at a press conference that \"awesome\" wins by other unions had given the IAM \"something to aspire to achieve as well.\"\nRichard Aboulafia, managing director of the AeroDynamic Advisory consultancy, said a lengthy strike would damage Boeing's turnaround prospects, but noted that a 2023 strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems lasted less than two weeks.\nBoeing has been under renewed scrutiny since a January incident in which a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing.\nHolden said he looked forward to getting back to the bargaining table.\nThursday's vote \"sends a strong message that our members deserve better,\" he said.\nSource: AFP\n[]https://www.tuko.co.ke/authors/afp/\nAFP AFP text, photo, graphic, audio or video material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium.
