    "title": "This is How Dairy Affects Your Hormones. Get Ready to #DitchDairy Today!",
    "text": "By now, it’s common knowledge that non-organic cow’s milk is one of the worst choices you can buy at the store due to the excess hormones, antibiotics, steroids, pesticides, and who knows what else it all contains. The food industry has tried to mislead us into believing that organic cow’s milk (and its products) comes with pure innocence and is made from cows that graze gracefully and happily in fields all day with the cleanest of air, water, fresh grass, and more. Regardless that almost none of this is true, cow’s milk is still one of the worst health food choices you can make for many reasons, no matter what kind of cows it comes from. The main reason is how it affects your hormones.\nAll cows that produce milk are pregnant, organically raised, fed, etc., or not. It makes no difference that their milk doesn’t have added hormones considering that alone, cow’s milk contains over 60 different hormones without anything being added to it . Now, while all of us have different hormone situations going on, there is no logical research that says we need to take in added hormones from another mammal.\nWhy Ditching Dairy is Important for Your Hormones: Cows are pregnant nearly 300 days of the year and Harvard Health shares that the more times a cow has been pregnant during that year, the more hormones she produces through her milk every time. Cows were not made to stay pregnant 300 days of the year and they develop infections due to this high demand for production, not to mention may be subject to further disease and bacteria when antibiotics aren’t used (such as in organic farming practices).\nSo, what about a cow’s hormones so detrimental to our health?\nHere are some things to consider:\n1. Insulin Issues One of the primary reasons dairy is linked to acne is that it raises insulin in the body. All dairy contains IG1, or insulin-growth factor. It raises our levels of insulin, which causes blood sugar swings that lead to acne. Acne is strongly influenced by hormonal changes, which is one reason so many teenagers struggle during puberty. Why would we put ourselves through that any more than necessary? No matter what kind of dairy you choose, you’re taking in excess insulin growth-like factor. Sadly, it’s promoted as a healthy option for bodybuilders looking to bulk up, but over time, it’s not a healthy choice and will likely cause insulin problems that lead to overeating, sugar cravings, and poor blood sugar control.\n2. Mood Swings Dairy also contains hormones that can lead to mood swings. Estrogen and testosterone are our sex hormones, and when they get out of balance according to our bodies’ needs, we suffer mood swings as a result. Dairy milk promotes excess estrogen in the body due to it containing estrogen from female cows. At the same time, milk naturally contains androgenic properties , so it raises testosterone in the body and can cause bulking quickly. It’s chock-full of all these hormones we don’t need scurrying throughout our bodies. Think about it this way: the dairy you consume contains hormones from the female cow and the male cow that were used during impregnation. That doesn’t sound so healthy or appetizing, now, does it?\nDairy milk accounts for about 80 percent of estrogen consumed through the human diet, along with the fact that milk from pregnant cows (which is how all milk products are produced) contains about 33 times as much estrogen as milk from non-pregnant cows.\nMood swings inarguably happen due to swift hormone fluctuations and women aren’t the only ones to suffer. Men can too, which is one reason dairy isn’t a healthy choice for anyone looking to have a healthier, happy, and more stable mood. How about some tastier, much healthier mood foods instead, all hormone-free?\n3. Cancer-Causing The jury is in: milk causes cancer in any form, organic or not. Check this out: Harvard Health studies show that dairy milk and cheese products led to testicular cancer in men ages 20-39 and have been found to affect breast, colon, and prostate cancer heavily as well. And then there’s the casein protein found in milk that has also been linked to cancer . Even without hormones or even lactose, casein is a detrimental protein to our health and should be avoided however possible.\nHelp Your Hormones: Ditch Dairy Sadly, the food industry would have you believe you need to consume milk to be healthy, but we know that’s not the case. Quit believing the lies about cow’s milk and have some other calcium-rich options instead , all free of these scary hormones.\nIf you need a dairy replacement, look to these milk-free alternatives. So Delicious Dairy Free Coconutmilk Creamer is an amazing alternative. This Milkadamia Unsweetened Milk is a great choice. Good Karma Flaxmilk is a new way to enjoy grain milk. And this Silk Soy Milk Vanilla is a must-have.\nLooking for other reasons to ditch dairy?

    "text": "On Wednesday afternoon, Robinhood Markets released its second-quarter financial reports, during which the brokerage strengthened its long-term cryptocurrency goals. At $28 billion, Firm's cryptocurrency trading volume increased 32% year over year. In the second quarter, revenue from transaction-based cryptocurrencies increased by 98% to $160 million.\nSource: X\nRobinhood Q2 Results announced $46 billion in cryptocurrency trading volume and $252 million in transaction-based income connected to cryptocurrency in its first-quarter financial report.\n\"We delivered strong business reports in Quarter 2 driven by relentless product velocity, and we launched tokenization—which I believe is the biggest innovation our industry has seen in the past decade,\" said Chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev.\nSource: Website\nThe company reported a 65% YoY increase in transaction-based revenues, a 25% YoY increase in net interest revenues, and a 33% YoY increase in other revenues. While quarterly revenue increased 45% to $989 million, Robinhood Q2 Results reported diluted earnings for the second quarter of $0.42 per share, which was double the amount reported a year earlier. MarketWatch data showed that both figures exceeded the consensus estimates.\nSource: Website\nRobinhood Q2 Results also had a 26.5M increase in funded customers, $279B total platform assets, $13.8B net deposits, and 3.5M RobinhoodGold subscribers.\nThe company has completed the acquisition of Bitstamp, expanded into 30 European countries, launched Stock Tokens, and reached $20B in Retirement Assets Under Custody. Robinhood Q2 Results shows the RobinhoodGold Card is now held by over 300,000 customers, and an agreement has been reached to acquire WonderFi.\nThe company's 2025 adjusted operating expenses and SBC outlook are revised to $2.15B - $2.25B, with WonderFi's acquisition expected to close in the second half of 2025, and plans for continued investment in new products and international expansion.\nSource Yahoo Finance\nRobinhood Q2 Results reflected in the company's stock closed Wednesday's session up 2.6% at $106.10 per share, giving the company a $93 billion market cap, according to Yahoo financial price data.\nCEO, Sergey Tenev, has announced that the company is focusing on tokenizing hard-to-reach alternative assets, including private shares, venture capital funds, and real estate. In Robinhood Q2 Results main focus in the US market is to tokenize these assets, which have traditionally been off-limits to retail investors due to regulatory and liquidity barriers. The company has already issued private equity tokens in Europe that resemble OpenAI and SpaceX shares, but these tokenization offerings have sparked a legal inquiry in Lithuania. OpenAI warned that its OpenAI token does not resemble actual equity in the company. The company's 25 million US users and $1 trillion in assets under custody make it difficult for others to replicate, and none of its competitors or blockchain-native firms are actively seeking this specific opportunity. The tokenization offerings have raised legal concerns, as they have already issued private equity tokens in Europe that resemble OpenAI and SpaceX shares.\nSheetal Jain is a seasoned crypto journalist, content strategist, and news writer with over three years of experience in the cryptocurrency industry.

Según han informado fuentes municipales, el incidente ha ocurrido sobre las siete de la tarde, en hora punta de la noria de 32 metros de altura, que tenía ocupadas todas sus cabinas. Los responsables de la misma han intentado arreglar la avería durante una hora, sin éxito. Transcurrido ese tiempo han avisado a los bomberos, quienes tras comprobar que tampoco se podía reanudar la marcha de la instalación, han decidido ir rescatando poco a poco, mediante dos escalas, a todos los usuarios atrapados. Sobre las nueve de la noche los bomberos habían rescatado ya a personal que ocupaba diez cabinas de las 24, y siguen desalojando a más clientes, que se encuentran \"tranquilos\", sin que se hayan producido daños personales.

    "title": "Osage Nation's Victorious War Cry After Judge Rules Wind Farm on Tribal Land Must Be Dismantled: 'This Is Our Homeland'",
    "text": "Commentary\nOsage Nation's Victorious War Cry After Judge Rules Wind Farm on Tribal Land Must Be Dismantled: 'This Is Our Homeland'\nThe Osage Nation in Oklahoma won a great victory for American property rights last week after a judge ordered the dismantling of a renewable energy wind farm that was erected without permission on their tribal lands.\nOne of the main reasons the\nNative American council opposed the wind farm was to protect their mineral rights, not to mention their ability to control their own ancestral homeland.\nBut the battle has been raging in court for a decade already, as the Osage Nation and its Mineral Council worked to eliminate the facilitates of Osage Wind LLC, Enel Kansas LLC and Enel Green Power North America Inc.\nThe victory was total. U.S. Court of International Trade Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves ruled in the case in Tulsa last week that the Osage Nation was awarded injunctive relief via “ejectment of the wind turbine farm for continuing trespass,” according to\nTulsa World.\nThe judge ruled that the\nwind turbine facility constituted “mining” and required a lease from the Osage Nation’s Minerals Council, something the wind farm companies neglected to do when erecting their turbines.\nThe mining ruling was made because the turbine construction crews began extracting tons of rock from the construction site, then crushing it to serve as backfill for their turbines, according to\nThe Energy Mix. The rock extraction was considered “mining,” and that required a lease agreement with the Osage Nation, a requirement to which the wind companies refused to adhere.\nNow, more than 80 wind turbines and their supporting facilities will have to be removed from the Osage lands as the Native group has had its\nproperty rights upheld.\n“The developers failed to acquire a mining lease during or after construction, as well as after issuance of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision holding that a mining lease was required,” Judge Choe-Groves wrote.\n“On the record before the Court, it is clear the Defendants are actively avoiding the leasing requirement,” the judge continued. “Permitting such behavior would create the prospect for future interference with the Osage Mineral Council’s authority by Defendants or others wishing to develop the mineral lease.”\nShe continued, writing, “The Court concludes that Defendants’ past and continued refusal to obtain a lease constitutes interference with the sovereignty of the Osage Nation and is sufficient to constitute irreparable injury.”\nOfficials of the Osage Mineral Council were thrilled — and even a bit shocked — by the ruling. Chairman Everett Waller said, “This is a win not only for the Osage Minerals Council; this is a win for Indian Country.”\nI’d argue it is also a win for American\nhttps://www.westernjournal.com/man-forced-relinquish-100k-beach-property-neighbor-invokes-obscure-law/. This wind energy group moved in and erected their turbines without a never-you-mind from the rightful owners of the property they built on. This is a win for everyone, not just “Indian Country.”\nWaller also lamented having to take such lengths in the first place, saying, “I hope no other tribe has to do what we had to do.”\nHe also made a good point, adding, “There are a lot of smaller tribes that couldn’t have battled this long, but that’s why we’re Osages. We’re here, and this is our homeland, and we are going to protect it at all costs.”\n“Our effort, not only will it protect the production side, but we’re looking at actually protection of our reservation for future generations,” Waller said, The Energy Mix added. “That is really a huge effort.”\nThe case is not quite over, either. Still to be determined is just how much money in damages the energy companies will have to pay the Osage Nation.\n“My legislature, the Osage Congress, has not yet spoken on that, neither has the Minerals Council, but as Chief, I can tell you, my view is—they’ve got to come down,” Osage leader Standing Bear said. “I would like to see damages to us for what we consider not only the cost of the rock but the cost of the trespass.\n“It’s been a cruel disregard for our rights, and it’s got to stop. And if they get off on minimal damages, others will come in and do the same thing,” Standing Bear added.\nIndeed, the Osage Nation is fully federally recognized and since the\n1906 Osage Allotment Act, the Native tribe has had rights to the oil, natural gas and other valuable minerals underneath their lands, as well.\nThese green energy companies clearly violated the law and the Osage Nation’s property rights, and it is well and good that they will be made to pay for that violation. This ruling is a huge win against the ongoing\nencroachment on American private property rights over left-wing green energy folly. Congratulations to the Osage Nation.\n ",

    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n粮食进口减少有助于改善国内市场预期，增强贸易加工企业市场信心，推动国内粮价企稳回升，提高农民种粮积极性，进一步增强我国粮食自给能力，牢牢把握住粮食安全主动权。\n根据海关最新数据，今年1月份至3月份，我国累计粮食进口量为2270万吨，同比减少40.8%。其中，除大米进口小幅增长外，小麦、玉米、大豆、高粱、大麦等粮食品种进口全线回落。粮食进口减少有助于改善国内市场预期，增强贸易加工企业市场信心，推动国内粮价企稳回升，提高农民种粮积极性，进一步增强我国粮食自给能力，牢牢把握住粮食安全主动权。\n党的十八大以来，我国确立“以我为主、立足国内、确保产能、适度进口、科技支撑”的国家粮食安全战略，在确保谷物基本自给、口粮绝对安全基础上，适度进口粮食，解决粮食结构性短缺问题。粮食供给弹性大，需求弹性小。近两年，国内粮食连年丰收，叠加粮食进口量持续保持高位，市场供给增加，需求增长却不及预期，市场呈现供大于求态势，粮食价格承压下行，影响了农民种粮收益。\n粮食是生活必需品，也是重要战略资源，对粮食贸易实行管控是世界各国通行做法。粮食生产与贸易之间应保持一种“跷跷板”动态平衡机制。当国内粮食丰收时，适当减少进口为国产粮食腾出市场空间；当国内供给不足时，扩大进口补充缺口。但是，在高度开放条件下，国内外粮食价差较大，如果不加以管控，国外低价粮会大量、无序地进入国内市场，冲击国内粮食供求平衡体系，严重危害粮食产业安全。作为世界粮食进口大国，我国在世界贸易组织框架下，通过进口配额、关税等政策工具对粮食进口进行管控，既保障国内市场稳定，又维护国家粮食安全。这种管控模式符合国际惯例。\n我国加入世界贸易组织以来，一直采取“重配额、轻关税”的粮食进口管理模式。对小麦、玉米、大米三大主粮实行进口配额管理，配额内进口征收1%关税，配额外进口征收65%关税，且配额长期保持稳定。对大豆、高粱、大麦、菜籽油等非主粮采取低关税政策，既保障国内需求，又降低进口成本。今年我国对原产于美国的大豆、玉米和小麦加征高额进口关税，这是基于国际贸易规则基础上的对等反制、正当反制，既保护了国内农业，又有效反击美国贸易打压。目前来看，我国粮食库存水平高且进口渠道多元，对美加征关税不会影响我国粮食稳定供应，但是对美国农业冲击较大，一些美国公司不得不收缩在中国业务，以应对贸易战等不利影响。\n当前关税大战烽烟四起，全球贸易不确定性增加。我国在对美国进行精准反制的同时，持续扩大对发展中国家产品零关税范围，对43个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及欧洲部分发展中国家进口产品实行零关税，既展现了我国捍卫国家核心利益的决心，又保持了扩大高水平对外开放的战略定力。通过深化与发展中国家合作，推动构建更加平衡、包容、共赢的国际贸易体系，为动荡中的全球经济注入确定性。这一做法不仅促进了我国粮食进口渠道更加多元化，增强全球粮食产业链供应链韧性，还能为发展中国家提供宝贵市场机遇，充分彰显了负责任大国的担当。\n粮食进口下降释放的信号，既反映调控成效，也折射应对复杂严峻外部环境的主动作为。当前，全球粮食贸易格局深刻调整，我国在持续提高粮食自给能力的基础上，坚持在开放中合作、在合作中共赢，增强国内国际两个市场两种资源联动效应，着力开创更大范围、更宽领域、更深层次农业对外合作新局面，推动形成更加安全、稳定、高效的全球粮食供应链，将为构建更高水平的国家粮食安全保障体系提供有力支撑。（作者：刘慧 来源：经济日报）\n（责任编辑：符仲明）",

(Photo by Ali Hashisho/Xinhua)\nBEIRUT, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's parliament speaker Nabih Berri on Thursday slammed Israel for targeting civilians and residential neighborhoods in Lebanon's southern villages and towns, the National News Agency (NNA) reported.\n\"Israel's targeting of civilians is a violation of UN Resolution 1701 and the rules of engagement,\" said Berri during his meeting in Beirut with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\nBerri said that Lebanon has adhered to Resolution 1701, which was adopted in August 2006 to seek a complete cessation of hostilities shortly after a deadly war between Israel and Hezbollah ended with a fragile truce.\nCameron arrived on Thursday in Lebanon to explore solutions that prevent military escalation in southern Lebanon, and discuss the situation in Gaza as well as British-Lebanese ties.\nDuring the meeting, Mikati said Lebanon supports a peaceful solution in the region, adding that Britain's support is essential in pushing in this direction.\nFor his part, Cameron emphasized the priority of a ceasefire in Gaza in preparation for moving to the following stages to resolve the conflict.\nConfrontations continued on Thursday on the Lebanese-Israeli borders, injuring a civilian in al-Wazzani village, who was later transported by the Lebanese Red Cross to Marjeyoun Governmental Hospital, according to the NNA.\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah armed group announced that its fighters attacked the Israeli al-Radar and al-Samaqa sites in occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms, confirming inflicting casualties among Israeli soldiers.\nThe Lebanon-Israel border witnessed increased tension since Oct. 8 after Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets toward Israel in support of the Hamas attacks on Israel the previous day, prompting Israel to respond by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.\nThe confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel have killed 240 on the Lebanese side, including 173 Hezbollah members and 39 civilians, according to Lebanese security sources. ■\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) vehicles are on patrol on the Lebanese-Israeli border in Marjayoun, Lebanon, on Feb. 2, 2024.

    "title": "The unexpected move that helped lift star Western Bulldog Adam Treloar to new heights",
    "text": "THE ADOPTION isn't official, but to Adam Treloar it feels like paperwork has been lodged. When Charlie Clarke turned up on his doorstep in Highett back in April, the Western Bulldogs star didn't realise it would have a seismic impact on his own life. But it has. Treloar saw a lot of himself in his younger teammate. They both endured a challenging childhood. They have both struggled with anxiety. At 31, he wanted to make a difference on someone else's career, he just didn't realise at the time that he was providing his daughter Georgie with a brother and himself with even greater purpose at work. While Treloar and his partner, Kim Ravaillion, attended last Thursday night's AFL Awards at Centrepiece, where the perennial ball-magnet was finally rewarded with his first All-Australian recognition, Clarke babysat Georgie at home. After being included in the squad three times across his five-year stint at Collingwood, Treloar received the individual recognition his career deserves, following the most complete season of his career. No one averaged more disposals in the home and away season than Treloar's 31.7 per game. But it was more than that. Never has he been more damaging than this winter. Treloar has always been a fastidious preparer. He spends an hour each week in an oxygen pod at Regen Wellness Centre in Hampton. He regularly visits a chiropractor in his own time. The little things matter. But this year, helping Clarke and prized pick Ryley Sanders find their feet in the AFL, helped him collect his first blazer. \"He wouldn't know this, and would get emotional with me saying this, but he is a big reason why I've had arguably my best season, because of worrying and caring about him. I get to the game on the weekend and I'm going out there with freedom,\" Treloar told AFL.com.au inside the new Whitten Oval on Monday afternoon. \"'Chook' has had it tough growing up and I could relate to that as soon as I met him. He was reserved and quiet and softly spoken internally. In the last 12 months you can see the amount of growth he has had, just with being more confident and being out there more. I'm proud of that. \"I could just see a kid that struggles with things in life that I struggled with when I was young. I could see a kid that has a lot of insecurities and battles a lot of anxiety, and I love being a shoulder to lean on. \"I've adopted him. He is living with Georgie, Kim and I and he is an older brother and will protect Georgie to the ends of the world. Having him in my life is more important than footy. He is a great kid. I can see myself in him a lot and all I want is for him to be happy and have success out there. Hopefully there is a long 10-plus year career for him ahead.\" Clarke, who is affectionately known as 'Chook', has played one senior game since being selected at pick No.24 in 2022, making his debut against Hawthorn in round eight. Treloar is in his corner, helping the out-of-contract forward land another contract and work towards more games in future. LEANING against a wall inside the Western Bulldogs' brand new $78 million training and administration base in Footscray, Treloar openly admits he didn't think he would get anywhere near 250 games, let alone still be playing at this age and stage. Not because he couldn't physically perform, but due to the mental toll. For a long time, he was crippled by stress, week in, week out, each season. It has taken a lot of work with sports psychologist Jacqui Louder to get this far. Everyone at Collingwood raves about Louder, where she is now a club employee. But to Treloar, she is family. Before a serious double hamstring injury ruled him out for months in 2018, Treloar contemplated retiring. He was relieved, instead of shattered. He became a vocal mental health ambassador the following year, airing his own experiences, but was then put through the wringer when Collingwood traded him away in acrimonious circumstances in 2020, despite Treloar having five years left on his contract. It almost broke him. \"I remember times when I was well and truly ready to finish. Obviously, the Trade Period was probably at its more extreme than other times. There were times when Kim and I discussed whether I should just retire. These are the ups and downs of footy and the challenges of coming to a new footy club,\" Treloar said. \"There were times when I never thought I'd get back up and play at a high level because I've always been someone who if I'm playing, I'm performing at a high level. I hold such a high standard of myself. I think that was the thing that kept me going. There were many times in a pre-season session or in-season where I just couldn't be bothered. Maybe I should just retire and play local footy. The drive in me to not let anyone down that has invested so much time in me, I just didn't want to do that. I could never imagine I would be 250 games in and now in a position to hopefully contend for a flag.\" Ravaillion has driven Treloar to wring the rag dry. She knows exactly what it takes to perform at an elite level. Not just the physical, but the mental requirements. After giving birth to Georgie during her time with the now-defunct Collingwood Super Netball franchise, the Australian international returned to the Queensland Firebirds – just before Treloar's trade saga – and played some of the best netball of her decorated career. The 31-year-old announced in July that she was retiring after three seasons as captain and two premierships across two stints at the club to return to Melbourne to reunite with Treloar for the remaining years of his career. \"She has been the number one influence from the moment she came into my life, definitely. I appreciated that a lot more when she sacrificed 12 months of her life when she gave birth to Georgie. I saw the hard work that went into getting herself back to a physical level where she could perform. The resilience that takes to do that, knowing she has had a 12-month setback essentially,\" Treloar said. \"She didn't have the best time at Collingwood in terms of performance, so to go back and captain the Firebirds, win the MVP, be in the team of the year and just be an absolute superstar of the competition was so inspiring. It's easy to wake up for pre-season knowing she was going to work her arse off and I was going to do the same thing. She is my number one inspiration, as is Georgie.\" Four years living in different states took its toll, but they made it work. Professional athletes are wired differently. They know they only have a finite time to achieve goals that a miniscule percentage of the population get the opportunity to do. But now they are back together – with Clarke in the spare room – and Treloar couldn't be more grateful for Ravaillion's sacrifice. \"The last two years have been hard. The first two were exciting. She was getting back to playing, I was playing for a new footy club. We made the granny. It wasn't as hard as people may think, but the last two years have been really challenging. There were times where we'd have a phone call and we'd be really emotional,” he said. \"The start of this year we had a pretty deep conversation about whether it was going to be her last year or not. We weighed the pros and cons. The reality is she could keep playing. She is so head strong and so professional, but it was time for us to get the family together and enjoy my last years of footy, rather than doing the long-distance thing. I know that sounds a bit selfish, but Kim was on the same page. I'm beyond grateful for her doing that.\" ---- TRELOAR has played on the final day of the season twice without leaving the ground with a premiership medal. Collingwood lost to West Coast by five points in 2018, courtesy of Dom Sheed's precise left foot. Then Melbourne ran over the top of the Bulldogs in the second half of the 2021 decider at Optus Stadium. Last year, Treloar sat with the family of his best mate Josh Dunkley and watched many of his old Collingwood teammates. He lived the full gamut of emotions as the Magpies won their first flag since 2010 by under a kick to crush Brisbane hearts. He never thought he’d play for another club after moving from Greater Western Sydney. He wanted to be a Collingwood premiership player. Winning one is the only reason he is still playing. \"I sat with Dunks' family. I was on the fence. I wanted Dunks to win but was so proud to see Jeremy Howe, who is one of my best mates win a premiership, plus 'Pendles' (Scott Pendlebury), Steele (Sidebottom), all these guys I played with. I was so proud in that regard,\" he said. \"Sitting there watching and wishing it was you. It is the reason why I play. The only thing that motivates me is to win a premiership. I'm hoping that it could be this year. It is my main motivation, it is the reason why I come to the footy club, the reason why I want to be the best version of myself for the boys because I know if we were to win it would be the greatest.\" Treloar is still wounded from what happened at Collingwood. How could he not be? He still hasn't spoken to Magpies coach Nathan Buckley, but in a dramatic twist last Thursday night, it was the Collingwood legend who announced Treloar's spot in the team, as part of his role on Fox Footy. The pair shared a grin and a thumbs up and have both publicly stated since then they will break bread in future. Vivid Sport's Tim Hazell has been with Treloar every step of the way. He navigated his client through the tumultuous period in 2020 and has helped guide him beyond a decade in the game when he didn't look like he was going to get there. It was the former Hawk who reminded Treloar he was a legitimate chance for an All-Australian spot late in the year, following months of noise. \"It was very special,\" he said. \"When you're young, you think about these individual awards a lot more. A lot won't say that, but they do when they're young. As I've gotten older, I never thought I was ever going to be a chance to be an All-Australian. I thought my years were when I was younger. It wasn't until the last couple of rounds when my manager brought it up that there was a chance. To be up there on stage next to some of the superstars of the game, I well and truly felt out of place. Extremely proud, one of the proudest moments of my footy career to be named as one of the best 22.\" Now Treloar has a blazer, bigger things await. But life is now about much more than football for the boy from Noble Park.",
