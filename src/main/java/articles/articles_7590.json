    "text": "AUSTIN (The Dallas Morning News/TNS/Hamodia) — Arrests were continuing into early Wednesday evening at the University of Texas after hundreds of students walked out of class to protest the war in Gaza and demand that the university system divest from companies that manufacture machinery used in war.\nDozens of state troopers and police officers in riot gear — many carrying zip ties and pepper spray — were on the Austin campus shortly after the pro-Palestinian protest began around midday.\nMore than 20 individuals had been arrested at the state’s flagship public university, most of whom faced charges of trespassing, according to officials from the Texas Department of Public Safety.\nStudents had locked arms on the South Mall, in front of the UT Tower, chanting as groups of officers advanced toward them during the protest.\nSome state troopers carried assault rifles and others were stationed on horses. Periodically, officers were heard ordering students to leave or face arrest.\nStudents chanted to officers, “Off our campus!”\nGov. Greg Abbott posted on social media late Wednesday that “arrests being made right now & will continue until the crowd disperses. These protesters belong in jail. Antisemitism will not be tolerated in Texas. Period.”\nHe went on to say, “Students joining in hate-filled, antisemitic protests at any public college or university in Texas should be expelled.”\nStudent organizers of the UT rally shared on social media that they planned to walk out of class, “reclaiming our space as we demand divestment now.”\nErick Lara, 20, a sophomore studying mechanical engineering, said he was on his way to the gym in the afternoon when he ran into the protest. He said it seemed to transform within minutes from a peaceful rally to one in which he saw people being arrested.\n“I didn’t think it would escalate this far,” he said. “And I didn’t think there would be this much police intervention into what’s supposed to be a peaceful protest. Not very peaceful when there’s a bunch of aggressors around, especially on horses.”\nUT officials sent out a letter earlier that said school officials would not tolerate disruptions “like we have seen at other campuses,” a spokesperson for the university’s division of student affairs said in a statement issued early Wednesday. “This is an important time in our semester with students finishing classes and studying for finals, and we will act first and foremost to allow those critical functions to proceed without interruption.”\nLara added that students have been upset with UT President Jay Hartzell for not speaking up about the war in Gaza, which is part of the reason why they’re protesting.\nUT officials have not responded to requests for comment.\nKXAN news reported that a letter sent to the student organization Palestine Solidarity Committee from UT’s office of the dean of students informed the group on Tuesday that the students were not permitted to hold their event on campus.\n“Refusal to comply may result in arrest,” the letter read. It went on to note that the group had “declared intent to violate our policies and rules, and disrupt our campus operations” with Wednesday’s planned rally.\nMeanwhile, in North Texas, dozens of students at the University of Texas at Arlington also walked out at that school on Wednesday, gathering in front of the campus library. Social-media videos showed students with signs and a banner that read “Stop arming Israel.”\nOn Tuesday, about 100 students at UT Dallas occupied the administration building for several hours calling for similar divestments. At that gathering, students were seen singing, writing to school officials and even doing homework as the night went on before an announcement was made that the campus president would meet with them.\nThe UTD students had noted they were also protesting Abbott’s executive order that the governor said was aimed at fighting antisemitism, charging schools with updating their free-speech policies.\nIn the order, issued in early April, Abbott said that he wants college officials to establish punishments — including expulsion — and to “ensure that groups such as the Palestine Solidarity Committee and Students for Justice in Palestine are disciplined for violating these policies.”\nThe Texas protests come days after students at Columbia University in New York were arrested and charged with trespassing.\nCampuses nationwide have had protests since Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 240 people hostage, according to the Israeli government. In the months following, Israel has invaded Gaza strip multiple times, killing over 34,000 people, according to the Ministry of Health in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn’t differentiate between terrorists and civilians. Hamas uses civilians as human shields, hiding and storing weapons in population centers, schools and hospitals.\nAt UT, many students wore keffiyehs. Some students began setting up tents on the south mall.\n“You don’t scare us,” the student crowd chanted, facing the officers. “We are the people!” “We pay your paychecks.”\nJasmine Santilla, 20, a sophomore studying accounting, said she saw students protesting peacefully when law enforcement showed up.\n“They weren’t throwing anything around, not harming anyone,” she said. “And the cops came in and arrested a good amount of people. For what?”\nMeanwhile, dozens of students with Israel flags and signs watched from the sidelines, among them freshman Corey Taitel, 19.\n“It’s great that (the police) are on our side,” the business major said. “They see the things happening in the Ivy League, and it’s extremely scary. So I feel overall safe.”\nTaitel said his mother has been calling him worried for his safety as a Jewish student.\n“Today three girls started screaming at me. They told me I need to burn my flag,” he said of the small Israeli flag he had. “I don’t think they should be arrested if they’re just standing there. But everybody that’s been arrested has (done something).”\nBy the early evening, the south mall was cleared off with a wall of officers prohibiting access.\nOrganizations and politicians across the country are watching the protests evolve at UT and other campuses.\n“This is a deeply alarming and sudden escalation at UT-Austin, seemingly on the basis of the behavior of students on other campuses,” said Kristen Shahverdian, campus free speech program director at PEN America, in a statement Wednesday afternoon.\nLaw enforcement must prioritize deescalation tactics and constructive dialogue during peaceful demonstrations, Shaimaa Zayan, operations manager of the Council on American-Islamic Relations chapter in Austin, said in a statement.\n“Arresting students advocating for peace sends the wrong message and only exacerbates tensions further,” Zayan said.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations has in the past been named an unindicted co-conspirator in a case involving the Holy Land Foundation, a Muslim charity accused of funneling funds to Hamas.",

    "title": "'It is historic': US poised to see record drop in yearly homicides despite public concern over crime",
    "text": "The year is expected to end with over 2,000 fewer murders than in 2022.\nWith 2023 ticking down, the nation is poised to finish the year with its biggest annual drop in homicides on record, according to preliminary data from law enforcement agencies both large and small.\nThe homicide rate in the United States is expected to plummet nearly 13% compared to 2022, meaning more than 2,000 fewer people were the victims of homicide this year, Jeff Asher, a national crime analyst, told ABC News.\nThe drop in homicides comes as more than three-quarters of Americans say there is more crime in the U.S. than a year ago and more than half of Americans say the same about crime in their local area, according to a Gallup poll released last month. Adding to that perception is the annual National Crime Victimization Survey published this month by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics that found the number of violent crime victims nationwide climbed from 16.5 per 1,000 people in 2021 to 23.5 per 1,000 in 2022.\nCities say the 2023 drop in homicides and other violent crimes can be attributed to expanded efforts to prevent crime, including working with community volunteers, targeting gun possession in high-crime areas and placing officers on foot and bike patrols.\n\"It is historic. It's the largest one-year decline,\" said Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former crime analyst for the CIA and the New Orleans Police Department. \"It's cities of every size, it's the suburbs, it's rural counties, tiny cities, it's large cities. It's really a national decline.\"\nAsher said his analysis is based on available preliminary crime data provided by 180 law enforcement agencies.\nHe said before this year, the largest year-over-year drop in homicides occurred in 1996 when murders fell by 9%.\nAn ABC News review of preliminary crime data from the 10 largest U.S. cities shows that heading into the last week of the year, seven of the municipalities have seen double-digit year-over-year declines in 2023 homicides -- including an 11% drop in New York City, a 16% decrease in Los Angeles, and a 13% reduction in Chicago.\nHouston, the country's fourth largest city, saw its homicide numbers fall by 11% and homicides in Philadelphia, the nation's sixth biggest city, have fallen by 21%, according to the preliminary data.\nThe challenge faced by local law enforcement to bring down the country's homicide numbers for the second consecutive year following a record jump in 2020 and a sizable increase in 2021, was achieved this year with a major assist from the U.S. Justice Department and bipartisan gun-control legislation passed by Congress, officials said.\n\"We're seeing double-digit declines in homicide across nearly 70 of America's largest cities,\" U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in an exclusive interview with ABC News chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas, citing information from the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\nMonaco said the federal government has played the role of \"force multiplier\" in helping local law enforcement drive down the nation's murder rate by identifying and removing the most prolific shooters and violent offenders from the streets.\n\"Something that we are doing is using new authorities from the most significant gun safety law that has passed in 30 years ... the bipartisan Safer Communities Act that passed last year. And with that tool, we've charged more than 300 defendants with new gun trafficking and illegal trafficking,\" Monaco told ABC News. \"We're using tools like crime-gun intelligence, the ability to trace the gun and the spent shell casing from a crime scene to identify who's that shooter, how many violent crimes have they been involved with.\"\nSmaller cities are also seeing dramatic decreases in homicides. New Orleans, which had the highest murder rate in the nation in 2022, has seen a 25% drop in homicides in 2023. Baltimore's homicide numbers have fallen by 25%, Atlanta's by 18%, and Miami's by 15%.\nBut not all cities have seen homicides fall. As of Dec. 26, Washington, D.C., has seen its homicides jump 36% and Dallas has seen a 14% increase. In Memphis, Tennessee, homicides rose 31% through the first six months of the year, the most recent data available.\n\"But those cities are especially notable because they are outliers this year, not the norm,\" Asher said.\nOne of the largest drops in homicides occurred in Detroit, which as of Dec. 26 has seen murders fall by 18% since last year, according to the police department's preliminary data.\n\"We're looking at some numbers that we haven't seen in close to 60 years in the city of Detroit,\" Detroit Police Chief James White told ABC News. \"But we're stopping short of celebrating because certainly we still have a lot of work to do.\"\nFollowing a rash of shootings in downtown Detroit in April, White immediately instituted a 12-point crimefighting program normally reserved for the hot summer months, he said.\n\"That involved just really having officers on foot patrol, bike patrol, engaging our community in a very positive way,\" said White.\nHe said the city, led by Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Wayne County prosecutor, has helped pave the way for an overall reduction in crime by boosting the number of police officers from 2,331 in 2022 to 2,486 in 2023 and giving cops a substantial pay raise. White said his department has been approved to hire another 200 officers in the coming year.\nLike other chiefs interviewed by ABC News, White attributed a large part of Detroit's crime turnaround to winning back the public's trust following widespread protests and calls for defunding police departments in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in 2020. White said the city forged relationships with \"community violence interrupters,\" civilians who work in the streets to help the police department pinpoint problem areas and solve crimes.\n\"They're sick and tired of the senseless, violent crime and they're cooperating. They're telling us where the problems are, and it's our responsibility to address them quickly and keep working to keep those relationships strong in the community,\" White said about community violence interrupters.\nThe result, he said, has been 55 fewer homicides in the city compared to this time last year.\n\"That's 55 lives, 55 people, 55 mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters that don't have to bury a loved one,\" White said.\nWhite also noted that there have been 135 fewer non-fatal shootings in Detroit compared to last year.\n\"So if half of those had resulted in homicide, you can clearly see what the numbers would be, and the victimization that would have occurred, the families that would be impacted. But the fact that 135 people weren't shot this year is absolutely incredible,\" White said.\nBesides the tumbling homicide numbers nationwide, Asher said preliminary data shows significant decreases in nearly every type of violent and property crime, except for auto theft which has risen 10%. Through the first three quarters of the year, he said aggravated assaults were down 7%, robbery declined 9% and the number of rapes fell 15%.\n\"It's something that I think ideally deserves more attention. We certainly pay attention when things go up,\" Asher said. \"I think that we should be talking about it and writing about it, and discussing it when it goes down as well because there are important things to learn there, and we should be acknowledging what's happening.\"\nDespite the reductions in homicides and other violent crimes nationwide, recent polls indicate the majority of Americans believe overall crime is out of control.\n\"Seventy-something percent of Americans believe crime is rising this year. And seventy-something percent of Americans in this case just happen to be wrong,\" Asher said, citing the Gallup poll last month.\nAsher's analysis appears to correspond with a report released last week by the Council on Criminal Justice, a think tank comprised of policy leaders in the criminal justice field. The CCJ analyzed preliminary crime data from 30 large U.S. cities and found that homicides in the first half of the year fell 9.4%.\n\"If this trend continues through the end of 2023, the nation will have experienced one of the largest single-year homicide reductions in the era of modern record-keeping,\" the CCJ said in a statement.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings across the nation, also reports a significant 9% drop in gun homicides this year. As of Dec. 26, 18,513 people had been victims of homicide, about 1,700 fewer than in 2022, according to the website.\nThe sizable fall in homicides comes after a record high in murders was set in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when courts were mostly closed and jail populations were being drastically reduced in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.\n\"Certainly, after it hit, we saw backlogs of cases and delayed trials and things like that,\" White said. \"There was no real accountability for bad acts.\"\nAccording to the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which analyzed data from 15,897 law enforcement agencies, the largest single-year jump in murders in more than a century occurred between 2019 and 2020 as murders and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses nationwide rose nearly 30%.\nHomicides across the country continued to increase in 2021 by 4.3% before falling by 6% in 2022, according to the FBI report.\nSan Antonio, Texas, the nation's seventh biggest city, has experienced a nearly 12% decline in homicides this year, after seeing murders rise by 43% in 2022 compared to 2021.\nSan Antonio Police Chief William McManus told ABC News that the 231 homicides that occurred in his city in 2022, included the deaths of 53 migrants found in the back of an abandoned tractor-trailer as part of a human smuggling operation.\n\"If you're looking at including those numbers, we're looking at about a 32% decrease. But if you extract those numbers, we're looking at a 12% decrease year-to-date,\" McManus said. \"But we're not complaining about 12% though.\"\nOne of the multiple crimefighting strategies McManus attributed to his city's falling homicide numbers was first suggested by a team of criminologists at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\"Actually, it was a very simple strategy that, quite frankly, I was somewhat skeptical of at first,\" McManus said.\nHe said by examining calls to the city's computer-aided dispatch system (CAD), the police department identified 28 areas of the city with the highest numbers of violent crime calls and even pinpointed certain days and times when the volume of calls is the highest.\n\"We will sit there at that location with our emergency lights on for 10 to 15 minutes. That's about as proactive as it gets,\" McManus said. \"We're not getting out stopping people or knocking on doors or anything like that. It's simply a high visibility, hot-spot policing effort.\"\nMcManus said that in the coming year, he plans to try other crimefighting strategies involving the city's public works department and animal control services.\n\"Specifically, to mention Animal Care Services, if you have a bunch of dogs running around, it brings the quality of life in that neighborhood down,\" McManus said. \"If you have a bunch of abandoned properties that are not being tended to, it brings the quality of life of that neighborhood down. Those properties could be used for drug sales, drug use, prostitution, all those things that make a neighborhood feel unsafe.\"\nAnother strategy is to \"address specific actors that are involved in violent crime,\" he said.\n\"We pull them in, most of them are under supervision, and we offer them services, we offer them possible employment. If you choose to accept that type of help, whatever it may be, then good for you,\" McManus said. \"But if you don't, then the next time you're arrested, we're going to throw the book at you.\"\nIn Phoenix, the nation's fifth largest city, interim Police Chief Michael Sullivan credited a 15% decline in homicides this year to a crimefighting strategy focused on clearing the streets of violent criminals in possession of guns.\n\"We know that if we focus on those areas, we're going to see reductions, and we did this year,\" Sullivan told ABC News.\nSullivan said his department launched \"Operation Summer Shield\" this year, which involved the help of federal and other local law enforcement agencies to round up people with warrants for their arrests. He said the operation resulted in the arrests of 580 people, with 70% wanted for felonies.\n\"I think we seized 40 guns from those prohibited possessors,\" Sullivan said.\nSullivan said he has also used the strategy of putting detectives on the streets during the summer months to help increase patrols, saying, such a move has \"been very important in helping us control the homicide number this year.\"\nLike in Detroit, Sullivan said non-fatal shootings, which he described as \"truly failed homicides,\" are down 18% this year and attributes that to the launch of a \"Non-Fatal Shooting Investigation Squad\" that responds whenever a bullet pierces the skin to assist or assume the investigation.\nBut like other police chiefs in cities with falling homicide numbers, Sullivan said community engagement has been the most beneficial in the post-pandemic era.\n\"Community engagement is much easier when you're not doing it on a Zoom call, when you're having face-to-face meetings with the community and being able to build that trust,\" Sullivan said. \"When I talk about community engagement, you put a lot of deposits in the bank before people trust enough to be able to give us the information to close crimes.\"\nSullivan said his agency has also focused on recruiting the best officers for the job.\n\"What we would expect from our police departments is to have a good strategy. But then you have to have women and men who can go out and execute that strategy,\" Sullivan said. \"That's what we have here at the Phoenix Police Department, and I believe that's a recipe for success.\"",

    "title": "Dengue e West Nile, quali sono le tecnologie più innovative per prevenire i virus tropicali?",
    "text": "Il riscaldamento globale sta accelerando la diffusione di malattie tropicali cosiddette “Neglette“, un gruppo di 20 patologie infettive causate da virus, batteri, parassiti, funghi e tossine: tra queste ci sono i virus trasmessi da zanzare, come la Dengue e la West Nile, oggi presenti anche in aree del mondo un tempo considerate a basso rischio come il Mediterraneo europeo. Secondo l’Istituto Superiore di Sanità, nel 2024 l’Italia ha registrato 213 casi autoctoni di Dengue, di cui 86 solo a Fano, nelle Marche, dove si è registrato uno dei focolai locali più rilevanti mai documentati nel nostro Paese. Allo stesso modo, nel 2023 sono stati confermati 332 casi di virus West Nile e 27 decessi. Il primo caso autoctono è del 2024, a Modena. Ma quali tecnologie possono essere messe oggi in campo per cercare di evitare di contrarre questo tipo di malattie?\nLeggi anche: Febbre Dengue e West Nile, quanti casi in Italia? Quali sono le Regioni più infestate dalle zanzare? La mappa interattiva\nTecnologie contro Dengue e West Nile\n«La cooperazione scientifica e gli investimenti in tecnologie innovative giocano un ruolo chiave per contenere la diffusione di virus tropicali anche in Europa. Insieme a nuove soluzioni vaccinali, la ricerca sta lavorando per sviluppare strumenti utili ad anticipare e gestire i focolai: tra questi ci sono sistemi predittivi basati su intelligenza artificiale, tecnologie genetiche per limitare la capacità infettiva delle zanzare e dispositivi diagnostici distribuiti», commenta Lorenzo Colombo, Chief Technology Officer di Ulisse Biomed, healthcare biotech company che opera nei settori della diagnostica, della teranostica e della terapeutica.\n848 milioni di persone hanno ricevuto trattamenti contro le malattie tropicali ed entro il 2030 l’OMS ha lanciato una roadmap che punta ad aumentare prevenzione e controllo. Ma prima di scoprire quali strumenti possiamo mettere in campo, scopriamo come si trasmettono questi tipi di virus.\nDengue e West Nile, come si trasmettono\nA trasmettere la Dengue sono le zanzare Aedes aegypti e Aedes albopictus (la zanzara tigre, presente anche in Italia), mentre la Culex pipiens (la zanzara comune, che punge principalmente di notte) è responsabile della West Nile. Entrambe le malattie si trattano con terapie di supporto, ma non esistono cure specifiche: la Dengue causa circa 20.000 decessi all’anno a livello globale, soprattutto nei soggetti vulnerabili (neonati, anziani, immunocompromessi); la West Nile è per lo più asintomatica, ma in 1 caso su 150 può provocare gravi complicanze neurologiche.\nCome prevenire i rischi?\nOggi esistono tecnologie che possono ridurre i tempi di risposta alle epidemie migliorando l’accesso a diagnosi tempestive e a trattamenti mirati con l’ausilio di dati genomici dettagliati. Ad esempio, Ulisse Biomed ha sviluppato soluzioni all’avanguardia per migliorare la sorveglianza epidemiologica e offrire una risposta rapida ai focolai, anche in aree con risorse limitate: tra queste c’è Hyris System, piattaforma portatile di analisi genetica per il rilevamento in tempo reale di virus come Dengue e West Nile in campioni biologici (sangue umano o zanzare) direttamente sul campo o, nella sua versione automatizzata, ideale per laboratori che gestiscono grandi volumi di campioni.\nPer chi dovrà viaggiare in aree a rischio Dengue o West Nile, i medici raccomandano l’adozione di misure preventive per ridurre al minimo il rischio di infezione. Tra le più efficaci, ci sono i repellenti per insetti, l’abbigliamento protettivo (maniche lunghe e pantaloni lunghi, di colore chiaro), l’utilizzo di zanzariere su letti e finestre e la permanenza in ambienti climatizzati o ben schermati. È importante evitare i ristagni d’acqua anche negli alloggi temporanei, perché possono diventare focolai di riproduzione delle zanzare. La protezione deve essere adattata agli orari di attività dei vettori: le zanzare che trasmettono la Dengue sono attive di giorno, quelle del West Nile all’alba e al tramonto. Nei Paesi dove la vaccinazione contro la Dengue è disponibile e raccomandata, è opportuno considerarla prima della partenza, soprattutto per soggiorni prolungati.\nUlisse Biomed ha sperimentato in Camerun questo tipo di tecnologie (ve ne avevamo parlato qui), nel contesto di un progetto internazionale di sorveglianza attiva della diffusione della malaria, dove ha collaborato con Johns Hopkins University e con la Gates Foundation per diagnosticare in tempo reale la resistenza agli insetticidi nelle zanzare, supportando strategie di controllo più efficaci e mirate sul campo.",
