    "title": "Why the Biden Admin Is Targeting This Christian University Again",
    "text": "The Biden Administration's continued efforts to target Christians and conservatives have taken priority on his short list of daily to-do's. President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against the largest Christian university in the United States on Wednesday. Grand Canyon University is facing a second lawsuit by an agency under the Biden Administration within the past few months in what the university says is a coordinated attack by multiple agencies against the institution. The lawsuit accuses the university of engaging in fraudulent advertising practices by marketing itself as a nonprofit institution and misrepresenting the price of its doctoral programs. The FTC claims the school has not adequately disclosed the costs of its \"continuation courses,\" which allegedly add thousands of dollars to the publicly disclosed cost of the degree. \"Grand Canyon deceived students by holding itself out as a nonprofit institution and misrepresenting the costs and number of courses required to earn doctoral degrees,\" Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, [said](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/ftc-sues-grand-canyon-university-deceptive-advertising-illegal-telemarketing) in a press release. \"We will continue aggressively pursuing those who seek to take advantage of students.\" Recommended According to the lawsuit, the Arizona-based university's \"marketing activities have also resulted in millions of abusive telemarketing calls to consumers who have specifically requested that Defendants not solicit them, and to individuals on the National Do Not Call Registry.\" In October, the Department of Education (ED) fined Grand Canyon University more than $37.7 million after an investigation found the school \"consistently misrepresented doctoral program costs.\" The university claims that the legal battle with the Biden Administration results from a deliberate targeting campaign. The school's president, Brian Mueller, told the Washington Examiner earlier this year that the investigation into Grand Canyon U was launched in lousy faith, calling them \"fishing expeditions.\" \"Given the major problems that exist in higher education related to high tuition costs, significant student debt, poor student loan default rates, long completion times, etc., it is baffling that the federal government has chosen to target a Christian university that is addressing those issues in very positive ways,\" the school said. \"No other institution in higher education is facing this level of government scrutiny, which speaks volumes about these agencies' motivations and agenda.\"",

    "text": "Leo Horoscope Today: Salutations to the regal Leo! Your natural charisma, creative flair, and unwavering ambition make you the star of the zodiac. Blessed with high self-esteem, Lions know that they possess enviable traits—and they're proud of them. They don't believe in false modesty and will be the first to praise themselves for a job well done. Your horoscope is a spotlight that guides you in shining brightly while staying true to your noble heart.\nHere is what is in store for you today:\nFor those born under the Leo sign, the day ahead is poised to be fairly balanced. Individuals engaged in employment should focus on maintaining their managerial skills without letting anger get the better of them. Approach colleagues with affection and understanding. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, might face potential setbacks in their businesses today. It's essential to remain patient and continue to put in hard work; the ebb and flow of profit and loss are inherent in business ventures. Young Leos should strike a balance between their academic pursuits and career aspirations.\nTaking care of one's health should also remain paramount; incorporating yoga and meditation into daily routines and starting the day with a walk on fresh green grass can be beneficial. You'll feel considerably lighter in your disposition. Family matters are likely to bring contentment and joy today. Endeavour to spend quality time with your children. Healthwise, be cautious as high blood pressure could be a concern. Ensure timely intake of prescribed medications. Maintain a deep-rooted faith in spiritual beliefs and trust in a higher power, as this will guide and support you in all endeavours. Participating actively in social and religious programmes will further enrich your spiritual journey.\n[Disclaimer: The content of this article is based solely on astrological predictions, and should be taken as general guidance.
