    "text": "CASPER, Wyo. — A chilly morning temperature of 21 degrees in Casper will double today as the final hours of 2023 tick away.\nThe National Weather Service in Riverton has forecast a high of 42 for the city under mostly sunny skies as a pattern of warm days continues.\n“Did you ever feel like you are trapped in a time warp? Across western and central Wyoming, with a few exceptions, it seems like the weather has been the same every day for the past week and a half or so. And this will continue for the most part for the next 5 days or so,” NWS in Riverton meteorologists wrote in the forecast discussion.\n“Much of the northern Rockies has been in a long wave ridge for much of December and this will continue into 2024. A couple of shortwaves will try to ride over the top of the ridge but this impacts again will be minimal, maybe some light snow showers over the west.\n“The only impacts, if you could call it that, would be some clouds from time to time. So it looks like more of the same, with mainly dry conditions,” they wrote. “Basins that have snow cover will remain cooler with temperatures near normal, like the Wind River and Green River Basins. Areas with little snow cover, like around Casper and Cody, will see above-normal temperatures pushing into the 40s at times. There will be some breezy conditions at times in the favored locations, like Casper. However, compared to what we can get this time of year, nothing we haven’t seen.”\nWhat that means for Casper is more of the same for days to come.\nThe New Year’s Day forecast calls for a high of 43. Skies will be partly sunny and become partly cloudy overnight as the low falls to around 21.\nTuesday through Thursday will see similar highs near 41 with sunny to mostly sunny skies. Overnight lows will drop to around 20 under partly cloudy skies.\nTemperatures will drop into the 30s, if the forecast holds up, on Friday and for the first weekend of 2024 as colder air approaches late in the week.\nMore on the forecast is available from the NWS in Riverton.",

    "text": "Thirty-one construction workers were rescued on Wednesday night in Los Angeles, California, after a major tunnel collapse trapped them 300 feet below ground.\nIn an update regarding Wednesday’s rescue operation, the Los Angeles Fire Department said, “31 persons, all believed to be tunnel workers, have been safely removed from the tunnel alive without visible injury. None are missing. The collapse of the 18′ diameter tunnel, being constructed for municipal wastewater management, occurred at an underground (undetermined depth) horizontal excavation site about 5 to 6 miles south of the sole entry/rescue access portal.”\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department added that preliminary reports indicated that the workers who were trapped in the tunnel were able to “scramble with some effort over a 12-15′ tall (undetermined length) pile of loose soil,” where they met multiple coworkers on the opposite side of the tunnel collapse and were “shuttled several at a time by tunnel vehicle to the entry/access point more than five miles distant.”\nREAD MORE: Pics: Massive drug smuggling tunnel shut down by Border Patrol\nThe New York Post reported that officials did not immediately confirm the cause of Wednesday’s collapse and that officials were not sure how large the tunnel collapse was. The outlet noted that the trapped workers were hoisted back to the surface with cranes and that more than 100 first responders were deployed to the scene to aid the rescue effort and provide medical evaluations for the construction workers.\nA video of the rescue operation was shared on X, formerly Twitter.\nAccording to an update on the Los Angeles County Sanitation District’s Clearwater Project, the tunnel that collapsed on Wednesday is currently under construction as part of the city’s waste management system under the $630.5 million Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel. The update noted that the tunnel shaft was initially opened in 2020, while mining on the project started in January of 2022.\nSharing a video following Wednesday night’s rescue operation, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass tweeted, “LAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for. I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.’s true heroes.”",

    "text": "Brian Fluharty/Getty Images The Detroit Pistons looked poised to snap their 27-game losing streak with a huge upset over the Boston Celtics on Thursday. They held a 21-point lead late in the first half and went into the break with plenty of momentum. That lead didn’t last, however. The Celtics mounted the comeback and ultimately won the game 128-122 in overtime. Boston looked like it could win it in regulation, but the Pistons managed to send the game to overtime in the final seconds after Bojan Bogdanovic tied it up with a put back after Cade Cunningham’s missed three. Jayson Tatum had a chance to win it at the buzzer but came up short. Detroit’s losing streak is now at 28-games after blowing the huge lead. It was the first time this season that the Pistons had led by 20+, but ultimately the huge lead wasn’t enough for them to hold on to.

    "text": "The Atlanta Braves are way further out of the playoff race than anyone would've expected.\nTechnically, a hot streak could change that, but it's certainly an uphill climb.\nThat has invited trade speculation, but president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos went on local radio station 680 The Fan on Wednesday to push back against those.\nAnthopoulos spoke specifically about the idea of trading away Chris Sale.\n\"I’ve seen the speculation,\" Anthopoulos said . \"It’s completely ridiculous to me. We are not selling, especially someone that has club control beyond the current year. Will not happen. I never make definitive statements unless I’m going to stick to them. Once you make definitive statements and then you go back on them, you’re a liar and you’re done.\"\nMORE: How Dodgers' Max Muncy, Athletics' Max Muncy have so much in common\nThat's pretty emphatic, but Anthopoulos wasn't done.\n\"Will. Not. Happen,\" he emphasized. \"Bold, italicize it, caps. So much so that I’m trying to make a trade now — it’s very hard to make a trade in June — just to signal to everybody that we will not sell. (If) you get to the end of July and things are completely changed, I guess we would reevaluate, but you’d have to be extreme. We’re built to win. Our expectations are to win. Our expectations are to go for it the entire time.”\nSale has been one of the bright spots in a rough season.\nHe threw a gem on Wednesday night against the Mets, too, going 8.2 shutout innings with seven strikeouts to lower his ERA to 2.52.\nSounds like he'll get the chance to keep doing that in a Braves uniform.\nMORE MLB NEWS:\nMets catcher makes boneheaded mistake you’ve never seen before Cubs' Pete Crow-Armstrong just played the most MVP-worthy inning Orioles had an 8-0 lead and somehow lost anyway Red Sox ace Garrett Crochet joins Pedro Martinez in franchise history Royals risk losing 45-year old star thanks to odd decision Dodgers' legendary pitcher was a better hitter than the 2025 Pittsburgh Pirates",
