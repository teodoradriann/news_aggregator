Sin embargo, lejos de esto, el nombre del juez chileno volvió a aparecer oficialmente de cara a la próxima doble fecha eliminatoria, en octubre. De hecho, desde la Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol confirmaron que Piero Maza dirigirá el partido entre Paraguay y Venezuela, en Asunción, con Claudio Urrutia y Miguel Rocha como sus jueces asistentes, además de tener a Felipe González como cuarto árbitro.

    "title": "LA Unified's Cell Phone Ban Could Spread to San Diego Unified",
    "text": "Last week, the board for the largest school district in California passed a remarkable resolution: a ban on cell phones. Los Angeles Unified School District officials’ ultimate goal is to restrict cell phone usage not only in class but during non-instructional periods like lunch as well. But LA Unified officials aren’t the only ones on the march toward a cell phone free campus. Gov. Gavin Newsom also recently joined the charge, citing an [advisory from Surgeon General Vivek Murthy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/23/surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-about-effects-social-media-use-has-youth-mental-health.html) on the potentially damaging impacts of social media on children. In [a brief press release](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/06/18/governor-newsom-supports-efforts-to-get-smartphones-out-of-schools/), Newsom wrote, “When children and teens are in school, they should be focused on their studies — not their screens.” The momentum to get phones out of classrooms has accelerated as students’ academic recovery from the pandemic has proved sluggish. Cell phones are by no means the sole cause of the slow recovery, but they can be a significant distraction during class. Kids don’t even have to be actively using them; [just the ping of a cell phone notification can derail a student](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/smartphones-school-only-when-they-clearly-support-learning), studies show. Some research in countries that have banned cell phones shows a positive impact on student learning, but [not everyone is convinced](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/10/we-looked-at-all-the-recent-evidence-on-mobile-phone-bans-in-schools-this-is-what-we-found/). But what’s going on in classrooms isn’t the sole concern. Cell phones’ overall impact on the mental health of kids is also a key driver for these bans. Comments from LA Unified board members in a press release about the ban drive that point home. “When I visit campuses during lunchtime, my heart breaks to see students sitting alone, isolated on their phones, instead of engaging and learning with their peers,” said board member Ortiz Franklin. Ban Diego Unified? San Diego Unified officials have also begun thinking about what role cell phones should play on campuses. During a conversation about AI in education, Board President Shana Hazan said: “With the use of any new tech and anything that shapes teaching and learning, we absolutely have to have a conversation about it and frankly we also have to have a conversation about tech more broadly and the impact of phones in schools.” That wasn’t a one off. Board member Cody Petterson said district officials have begun to take a “deep dive,” into research into the potential harms of cell phone use in schools. To him, the research is clear. Cell phones present a whole slew of potential psychological and instructional harms. He regularly hears from teachers about the challenges they pose to learning. “I think early in the academic year, you’ll see some initial board action on it and the beginning of a process of consultation with stakeholders, with staff, with site leaders, with families and with community organizations,” Petterson said. Petterson said he can’t speak for the entire board but “the likelihood is very strong that there will be some form of [cell phone] exclusions from some settings.” But “ban,” is a strong word, he said, and the district is still very early in the process. Exactly what the policy may look like will shift depending on what staff members find in their research review. If they find cell phones in classes harm learning, then Petterson thinks they’ll ban them from classrooms. But if they find cell phone use creates more severe social and emotional harm, “We’re going to have to consider more profound and more pervasive exclusions,” Petterson said. The implementation dilemma: Research has long linked the precipitous increase in cell phone usage among children to a similarly precipitous rise in mental health struggles. But figuring out how to keep cell phones out of kids’ hands during school will likely prove to be a monumental challenge. After all, at least [one survey](https://www.k12dive.com/news/teen-cell-phone-use-schools/694901/) found 97 percent of 11- to 17-year-old kids use their phones during the school day. Pair that with parents’ desire to stay in contact with their kids – at least in part out of fear of school violence – and you’re faced with a real sticky wicket. LA Unified board members seem to understand those complications, which is why they’ve delayed the start of their ban until January to give them time to work out the details. Petterson said those inevitable implementation hurdles underscore why it’s so necessary to bring stakeholders like parents, site leaders, teachers and students in early and in a genuinely collaborative way. Without the buy-in of everyone involved, implementation becomes a tangled mess. That’s especially true for teachers, who will be on the frontlines of enforcing any ban. “It’s about collaborating in the very beginning, so the community and your stakeholders are part of the policymaking,” Petterson said. “We want to have a policy that ultimately reflects the values and the best interests of the community at large.” Content Bouncing Around My Mind Palace If you’ve followed Voice’s education reporting you know how often districts throw up firewalls to prevent us from accessing documents, like investigations into employees. The Union-Tribune recently wrote about [one of the most popular strategies](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/06/23/how-california-agencies-are-keeping-misconduct-investigations-secret-despite-transparency-laws/): bringing in lawyers and obscuring investigations behind attorney-client confidentiality. What We’re Writing Earlier this year, prosecutors charged Hoover High Assistant Principal Charles De Freitas with three counts related to sexual misconduct with minors, including possession of child pornography. I found it [wasn’t the first time De Freitas had been accused of misconduct](https://voiceofsandiego.org/2024/06/20/hoover-assistant-principal-arrested-for-child-pornography-was-accused-of-sexually-harassing-a-student-years-earlier/). Two years prior to his arrest, and just a couple of months before he was promoted to assistant principal, a parent contacted Superintendent Lamont Jackson alleging De Freitas was sexually harassing their child.",

    "title": "Canadian Muslim Leaders Demand Action on Gaza, Restrict MPs' Access to Mosques",
    "text": "As the sun sets, casting long shadows over the quiet streets of Canada, a profound shift is taking place within its Muslim communities. An open letter, a clarion call for peace and justice in Gaza, is challenging Canadian politicians in a manner unseen until now. Spearheaded by the National Council of Canadian Muslims and bolstered by the voices of several mosques, this letter is not just a document but a testament to a community's resolve to seek meaningful change amid escalating violence in Gaza.\nThe Demands: A Line in the Sand\nThe core of the letter is unambiguous. It calls for Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs) to publicly demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, condemn Israel's military actions as 'war crimes', and push for the reinstatement of funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). This comes in the wake of an intensifying conflict that saw a surge on October 7, 2023, following an attack by Hamas-led militants. The violence, marked by significant casualties on both sides and a looming threat of a ground invasion in Rafah, has drawn global attention. Yet, it's the Canadian Muslim community's pointed critique of their government's suspension of UNRWA funding—after allegations against its employees—that underscores a broader call for solidarity with Palestinians.\nA Community's Ultimatum\nWith Ramadan approaching, the letter sets a clear ultimatum: MPs who fail to align with these demands will not be welcomed to address Muslim congregations. This stance is emblematic of a community no longer willing to accept passive gestures or empty promises. Far from mere rhetoric, this move is a direct challenge to politicians who seek the support of Muslim voters. It embodies a refusal to be marginalized or taken for granted, signaling a shift towards advocacy that is tangible and impactful. The community's leaders are not just asking for words of support; they are demanding actions that reflect a genuine commitment to peace and justice.\nThe Ripple Effects\nThe implications of this collective stance are profound. Not only does it spotlight the significant role of Muslim communities in the Canadian socio-political landscape, but it also raises critical questions about the nature of political advocacy and representation. By conditioning access to their congregations on MPs' public commitments, these leaders are redefining the boundaries of political engagement. It's a bold strategy, one that prioritizes principle over politicking, and it sends a strong message to all elected officials about the importance of aligning words with deeds. Moreover, this approach underscores a broader, global narrative of solidarity with the Palestinian cause, challenging the international community to reexamine its stance on the conflict in Gaza.\nIn the shadow of an ancient conflict that has found a new battleground in the heart of Canadian politics, the Muslim community's open letter stands as a beacon of hope for some and a stark warning for others. It represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing dialogue about peace, justice, and the role of communities in shaping the policies of their governments. As the world watches, the outcome of this bold move remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the conversation about Gaza, and Canada's role in it, has irrevocably changed.",
