    "text": "MONROE, N.C. — A decades-long pastor at a church in Monroe apologized after facing backlash for comments he made during a sermon about sexual assault victims. The Rev. Bobby Leonard, at Bible Baptist Tabernacle Church on Walkup Avenue, said last summer that women make themselves targets for sexual assault based on how they dress. “You will find more women in those places with shorts than you will women with pants and dresses put together,” Leonard said during the summer sermon. “If you dress like that and you get raped and I’m on the jury, he’s going to go free .. because you know, a man is a man. A man is a man.” Ben Rudy, a former member, was in front of the church protesting Wednesday night. “It broke my heart that he would say something like that,” Rudy told Channel 9′s Glenn Counts on Thursday. Jason King, who has taught Sunday School at various churches in the area, has also protested against Leonard. “Rape is wrong and I don’t care if a woman is walking around,” King said. “You in the nude. It’s still not right and it’s still a man’s choice whether he does wrong or right.” There was a message on the church sign Thursday night. It was Leonard apologizing. “I am sorry for any hurt,” it read. “I was wrong.” “I think that sign is headed in a good direction,” King said. “I think that’s the start of a good direction, but people want to hear it. They want to hear it out of his mouth.” Rudy doesn’t think Leonard should leave. “I think the congregation if they love him like they say they do, let him repent and let him go in the pulpit and apologize to the congregation and to the community,” Rudy said. Both men were disappointed that church leadership didn’t take action sooner. “I was stunned, to be honest with you,” Rudy said. Counts asked church officials if he wanted to go on camera but he was told no and that officials would be releasing an additional statement. The National Sexual Assault Hotline is 800-656-HOPE.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "The Alberta Junior Hockey League has cancelled all upcoming games involving five teams poised to bolt to a rival junior A circuit and its 11 remaining clubs. The B.C. Hockey League announced Saturday the Blackfalds Bulldogs, Brooks Bandits, Okotoks Oilers, Sherwood Park Crusaders and Spruce Grove Saints will come under its umbrella in 2024-25. The AJHL scratched four games off its schedule earlier this week before Thursday's announcement. The league said in a statement it is \"taking steps to protect the integrity of the AJHL and (Canadian Junior Hockey League) playoff system\" along with ensuring \"the safety of our players and officials.\" The five teams heading to the BCHL will still be allowed to play scheduled games against one another \"out of respect for the players,\" the AJHL said. The BCHL cut ties with Hockey Canada — the sport's national governing body — in May. The league said at the time the move toward an independent setup would provide more options for players looking to compete in U.S. college hockey. The CJHL is a step below the top-tier Canadian Hockey League, which includes the Western Hockey League, Ontario Hockey League and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024. The Canadian Press",

    "text": "As WeWork moves onward with\nits dramatic restructuring efforts, the company is being accused by some of its landlords for withholding millions in rent payments.\nAccording to a report\npublished by the Commercial Observer, WeWork did not pay $33 million in rent to the owners of six buildings across the U.S. — which was due on January 1.\nIn a\nrecent court filing, as first reported by BisNow, the withholding of rent payments is being cited as a negotiation tactic used by WeWork to put pressure on landlords during lease negotiations — potentially violating U.S. bankruptcy code, which doesn’t allow companies to ignore rent payments.\nAccording to the court filing, “The Committee understands that notwithstanding nonpayment of January rent, the Debtors have not rejected any of the applicable leases, nor have the Debtors returned possession of any of the applicable locations to their property owners. The Debtors instead appear to be pursuing a strategy where unilaterally, in an effort to strong-arm negotiations with certain landlords, they can receive all the benefits of their leases, including receiving fees from their members, without any payment on account of the administrative rent claims. It is improper for the Debtors to use the bankruptcy process to have it both ways.”\nA WeWork spokesperson states that the company’s actions are “temporary” and aimed at expediting negotiations to reach “mutually beneficial agreements,” according to Commercial Observer.\nSo far, the company has amended 40 leases and is in talks with landlords at hundreds of locations. WeWork’s financial struggles became public with its\nChapter 11 Bankruptcy filing in New Jersey last November, revealing a debt of approximately $18.7 billion. This was followed by plans to reject 67 leases at underperforming locations — with an additional 13 added later, all of which received court approval. By rejecting leases and amending others, it’s estimated that WeWork has slashed at least $3.7 billion in lease expenses so far. Commercial Observer",

    "text": "Scalp micropigmentation, a revolutionary technique in the field of hair restoration, is gaining attention as a viable solution for those facing hair loss challenges. This method, distinct from traditional hair transplant surgery, offers an alternative approach for individuals seeking to address hair thinning and baldness.\nThe process of scalp micropigmentation involves the application of pigment to the scalp, creating an illusion of fuller hair. Unlike hair transplant surgery, which typically involves grafting hair follicles to the balding areas, scalp micropigmentation is non-surgical and less invasive. It's a cosmetic procedure that replicates the appearance of hair follicles, providing a natural-looking hairline and adding density to thinning areas.\nThe Growing Popularity of Scalp Micropigmentation\nRecent years have seen a surge in the popularity of scalp micropigmentation. This rise can be attributed to its effectiveness in providing a solution to hair loss without the need for surgery. It's a versatile procedure that can benefit a wide range of individuals, including those with pattern baldness, alopecia, and thinning hair. Moreover, scalp micropigmentation can be used to conceal scars from previous hair transplants, enhancing the overall appearance of hair. To learn more about this procedure and to find reputable providers, interested individuals can go now to explore available options.\nScalp Micropigmentation Versus Hair Transplants\nWhile hair transplants have been a long-standing solution for hair loss, scalp micropigmentation offers a unique set of advantages. It requires no surgery, meaning there is minimal recovery time and lower risk of complications. Additionally, the results are immediate, whereas hair transplants may take several months to show full results. Scalp micropigmentation is also cost-effective compared to the more expensive hair transplant procedures.\nTraining and Expertise in Scalp Micropigmentation\nAs the demand for scalp micropigmentation increases, so does the need for skilled practitioners. Training courses are becoming more prevalent, equipping individuals with the techniques and knowledge required to perform this delicate procedure. For instance, BrowMaster Launches Scalp Micropigmentation services and training courses in India , highlighting the global expansion of this technique. Courses like these offer comprehensive training, ensuring practitioners are well-versed in the intricacies of the procedure.\nThe Role of Technology in Scalp Micropigmentation\nTechnological advancements have played a significant role in the development of scalp micropigmentation, according to realtimecampaign.com. Modern equipment allows for precise application of pigment, ensuring a natural and seamless look. The pigments used have also been refined, offering a range of colors that match the individual's natural hair color.\nThe Future of Hair Restoration\nLooking ahead, scalp micropigmentation is poised to become an increasingly popular choice for those seeking a solution to hair loss. Its non-invasive nature, coupled with the growing number of skilled practitioners, makes it an accessible and appealing option. It’s not just a cosmetic procedure but a form of artistry that requires skill and precision.\nFor those considering scalp micropigmentation, it's important to consult with a qualified practitioner to discuss the best approach for their specific needs. Leading companies like Bosley are a testament to the growing interest and trust in these procedures.\nScalp micropigmentation is a revolutionary technique offering a promising alternative to traditional hair transplant methods. Its rise in popularity is a testament to its effectiveness, affordability, and the natural-looking results it provides. As technology and training continue to evolve, scalp micropigmentation is set to play a pivotal role in the future of hair restoration solutions.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Realtimecampaign.com\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 407-875-1833\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: Realtimecampaign.com\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "title": "New AI system aims to reduce power outages and boost grid reliability – India TV",
    "text": "A team of US researchers has developed a new AI model which could help the electrical grids prevent power outages by automatically rerouting electricity in milliseconds. The automated system, which was published online in the Nature Communications journal, is an early example of 'self-healing grid' technology, which uses AI to detect and repair problems like outages and storm-damaged power lines on its own without human intervention. Some researchers from the University of Texas at Dallas demonstrated their solution which could automatically identify alternative routes to transfer electricity to users before an outage occurs. It is because the AI has the advantage of speed, the team said. Unlike human-controlled processes that can take minutes to hours, the system could automatically reroute electrical flow in microseconds. Dr Jie Zhang, associate professor of mechanical engineering at the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science said, \"Our goal is to find the optimal path to send power to the majority of users as quickly as possible.\" \"But more research is needed before this system can be implemented.\" Roshni Anna Jacob, an electrical engineering doctoral student at the varsity, said that electricity blocked due to line faults can be reconfigured using switches and power from available sources nearby, such as from large-scale solar panels or batteries. The researchers next aim to develop similar technology to repair and restore the grid after a power disruption. ALSO READ: How to livestream on Instagram exclusively for your ‘Close Friends’ list?
