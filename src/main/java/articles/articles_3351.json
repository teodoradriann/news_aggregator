The post, criticized for promoting caste division, led to opposition backlash, with AIMIM chief Assaduddin Owaisi and others condemning it. Assam Chief Minister [Himanta Biswa Sarma](https://www.thehansindia.com/tags/Himanta-Biswa-Sarma) In his statement on X, Sarma conveyed his sincere apologies to anyone who may have been offended by the deleted post. The controversial post, shared on December 26, triggered a significant backlash, with opposition leaders, including AIMIM chief Assaduddin Owaisi, accusing Sarma of promoting caste division. The post suggested, based on the Bhagavad Gita, that it is the \"natural duty\" of Shudras to serve the other three castes of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Owaisi, in response, characterized the post as reflective of the \"unfortunate cruelty that Assam's Muslims have faced in the past few years\" and asserted that Hindutva contradicts principles of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and Justice. The CPI(M) and Congress leader Pawan Khera also criticized Himanta Biswa Sarma, with the former describing the post as indicative of the \"BJP's Manuvadi ideology in full play.\" Khera emphasized that such remarks cannot be ignored, highlighting the sensitivity surrounding the issue.",

Elle continuera de grossir en début de nuit pour atteindre 5 mètres avant l'aube, demain, samedi 3 août 2024. Soyez très prudent ! Ces vagues énormes sont spectaculaires quand elles se brisent contre une falaise ou s'étalent sur une plage.\nDans les deux cas, il y a danger. Ces vagues provoquent des projections de pierres quand elles viennent frapper le sol. Les déferlantes, qui peuvent mesurer le double de la hauteur moyenne, peuvent également vous surprendre.

    "title": "James Earl Jones: Hollywood's Iconic Voice Served As An Officer in the US Army",
    "text": "By Elisabeth Edwards ,\n3 hours ago\nActor James Earl Jones is renowned for his iconic voice in Hollywood, from the menacing Darth Vader in Star Wars to the noble Mufasa in The Lion King . His career extended beyond film, as he also served as an officer in the US Army, earning recognition as a distinguished soldier both on-screen and off.\nJames Earl Jones' early life Robert Earl Jones as he appeared in a stage play + James Earl Jones at the 2015 American Theatre Wing Gala. (Photo Credit: 1. CORBIS / Getty Images 2. Walter McBride / WireImage / Getty Images) James Earl Jones was born on January 17, 1931, in Mississippi, but was raised by his grandparents in Michigan after his father, who also an actor, left the family. The trauma of losing his loved one as a child led to a severe stutter, causing him to speak very rarely. It wasn't until his high school English teacher, Donald Crouch, encouraged him to share his poetry in class that he began overcoming his speech impediment.\nAfter high school, Jones attended the University of Michigan, where he initially majored in pre-medical studies. He also joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), excelling and thriving in the structured environment and camaraderie alongside fellow cadets.\n\"My only semblance of a social life came in the fraternity of my fellow ROTC cadets in Pershing Rifles and Scabbard and Blade,\" Jones once remarked on his early experience in the US military.\nService with the US Army The Hunt For Red October , 1990. (Photo Credit: KallieP / Paramount Pictures / MovieStillsDB) Eventually, James Earl Jones realized medicine wasn't the right path for him and switched his program to join the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre and Dance. At the time, the Korean War was raging and Jones thought he should be in a program he enjoyed before, he assumed, he was called up to fight in the conflict.\nWhile awaiting his orders, Jones worked as a part-time stagehand at a local theater. He was commissioned in mid-1953, shortly after the end of the war, and reported to Fort Benning , Georgia, where he attended the Infantry Officers Basic Course and US Army Ranger School. Jones was assigned to Headquarter and Headquarters Company, 38th Regiment Combat Team. He was a leader in his battalion, which became a training unit based in the cold and rugged Rocky Mountains of Colorado.\nThe actor shared his thoughts on the experience in an interview, saying, \"I took to the physical challenge, so much so that I wanted to stay there, testing myself in that awesome environment, mastering the skills of survival. I loved the austere beauty of the mountains and the exhilaration of the weather and the altitude. I didn't mind the rigors of the work or the pioneer-like existence. I thought it was a good life.\"\nJones was promoted to first lieutenant, but when deciding whether to fully commit to the military he knew he was destined for another path. He realized he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, Robert Earl Jones, and pursue acting. His commanding officer told Jones to follow his dream and reminded him that he could always return to the Army if things didn't work out.\nJames Earl Jones' successful acting career The Great White Hope , 1970. (Photo Credit: Afro American Newspapers / Gado / Getty Images) Jones packed up his belongings and moved to New York City in the mid-1950s, working as a janitor while trying to find acting opportunities. He'd previously starred in several shows back home, including the role of Othello in the Shakespearean play of the same name. While in New York, he continued to take on leading roles in such productions, eventually becoming one of the most famous Shakespearean actors of the time.\nBy 1957, Jones had scored his first role on Broadway and, in 1964, made his first on-film appearance in Stanley Kubrick 's Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. He later appeared alongside the brightest stars of the 1960s, including Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor .\nIn 1970, Jones' leading role in The Great White Hope scored him a historic Academy Award nomination, making him the second Black man in history to be nominated in the category.\nStar Wars Star Wars: A New Hope , 1977. (Photo Credit: vodasimpson / Lucasfilm / 20th Century Fox / MovieStillsDB) In 1977, James Earl Jones appeared in one of his most iconic roles, even though he insisted on being uncredited for it. He played the voice of Darth Vader in George Lucas ' Star Wars: A New Hope . Vader's character was physically played by David Prowse, with Jones' voice dubbed over. He reprised the role in the other two films within the trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983).\nHis iconic voice also appeared in animated classics like The Simpsons (1989-present) and The Lion King (1994), as well as full-fledged roles in films like The Hunt For Red October (1990) and Conan the Barbarian (1982).\nAwards and accolades James Earl Jones takes his Opening Night curtain call for the Broadway show, You Can't Take It With You , 2014. (Photo Credit: Bruce Glikas / FilmMagic / Getty Images) In 1992, President George H.W. Bush awarded James Earl Jones the National Medal of the Arts . Years later, President George W. Bush also awarded him the Kennedy Center Honors and the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. Jones also achieved the prestigious \"EGOT\" title, meaning he received all four major Hollywood awards: an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award - although his Oscar was honorarily awarded.\nMore from us: Henry Fonda Served In the US Navy During WWII - He Didn't Want a 'Be a Fake In a War Studio'\nWant War History Online 's content sent directly to your inbox?

    "text": "Macron Calls for Ceasefire in Lebanon French President Emmanuel Macron urged the U.S. to pressure Israel into accepting a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, which Israeli officials have rejected. Macron warns an Israeli invasion would be a mistake and aims to escalate the matter to the UN if necessary. French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday called on the United States to pressure Israel to accept a plan for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, warning that an Israeli invasion would be a monumental mistake. Earlier, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz rejected a French-U.S. proposal for the truce. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commanded the military to continue its operations with full force. Macron, speaking in English, emphasized there is still time for Netanyahu to commit to the plan during his interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \"I do believe that the U.S. now has to increase the pressure on the Prime Minister of Israel to do so,\" Macron stated. Should Netanyahu refuse, France plans to bring the issue before the United Nations Security Council. \"We expect all partners to be vocal and committed with us to send a clear message: Israel cannot invade Lebanon today. War is not an option; it would risk catastrophic escalation,\" he added. During a news conference in Montreal, Macron mentioned he did not consider the Israeli officials' comments on the ceasefire as final. He stressed that France opposes the idea of Lebanon turning into another Gaza, urging Israel to halt its strikes and calling on Hezbollah to cease retaliations. (With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "A Igreja de Jesus Cristo dos Santos dos Últimos Dias está trabalhando com a Helen Keller Intl. para aumentar a autossuficiência dos moradores da Costa do Marfim. A Helen Keller Intl., uma organização sem fins lucrativos que reduz as barreiras à saúde e à nutrição em todo o mundo, tem uma iniciativa no país, localizado no oeste da África, chamada “Enhanced Homestead Food Production” [Produção aprimorada de alimentos em propriedades rurais]. A Igreja tem apoiado esta iniciativa nos últimos anos, a qual ajuda mulheres e famílias a melhorarem as práticas de nutrição, saúde e higiene, aumentando assim a autossuficiência. Este ano, a Igreja e a Helen Keller Intl. conseguiram atender a mais comunidades na parte norte da Costa do Marfim. Ao fornecer materiais para criar e manter uma horta comunitária, bem como treinamento e educação abrangentes sobre práticas agrícolas e diversificação de culturas, as famílias puderam cultivar seus próprios alimentos nutritivos. [Exemplos desses alimentos incluem](https://helenkellerintl.org/our-stories/community-garden-in-cote-divoire/) não só repolho, alface, cebola, cenoura, abobrinha e pepino, mas também feijão verde, tomate, pimentão, pimentas, berinjela, quiabo, batata-doce de polpa alaranjada, milho e mamão. O treinamento em nutrição também apoia famílias e crianças que são examinadas para verificar se há desnutrição. O aumento da produção e do acesso a alimentos nutritivos está ajudando a melhorar a diversidade da dieta, especialmente entre mulheres grávidas e lactantes, adolescentes e crianças pequenas. Também foi criada uma associação comunitária de empréstimos, a fim de ajudar a capacitação das mulheres da comunidade. Elas podem financiar atividades geradoras de renda e aumentar sua educação financeira. Isto está melhorando suas oportunidades de renda e seu poder de decisão na comunidade. “O aumento das temperaturas e os padrões de chuva menos previsíveis estão tornando mais difícil para as famílias terem uma boa colheita e manterem uma boa nutrição, particularmente naquelas do norte da Costa do Marfim, “, disse Hubert Zirimwabagabo, diretor nacional da Helen Keller Intl. na Costa do Marfim. “Com o generoso apoio de A Igreja de Jesus Cristo dos Santos dos Últimos Dias, a Helen Keller Intl. é capaz de oferecer a mais mulheres o apoio de que precisam para que elas e suas famílias possam prosperar.” Mulheres no centro do trabalho As mulheres estão no centro do trabalho da Helen Keller Intl.. Em muitas comunidades onde a organização trabalha, as mulheres têm direitos limitados de possuir sua própria terra e poder para tomar decisões financeiras no lar. No entanto, quando as mulheres ganham a vida, elas gastam sua renda com alimentação, moradia, educação e assistência médica, ou seja, tudo que contribui para a saúde e o bem-estar da família. Quando uma família não tem renda suficiente, as mulheres tendem a ser as últimas a comer e as últimas a procurar atendimento médico. Portanto, oferecer às mulheres ferramentas e conhecimento para cultivarem seus próprios alimentos, e mais habilidades para venderem seus produtos, permite que elas cultivem mais e obtenham renda extra. Elas têm autonomia para ajudarem suas famílias e a si mesmas. Estas metas estão alinhadas com a iniciativa global da Igreja para mulheres e crianças, liderada pela Sociedade de Socorro. Tal iniciativa busca ter o maior impacto possível, investindo dinheiro em esforços para abençoar, especialmente a vida de mulheres e crianças com menos de 5 anos de idade, por meio das áreas de cuidados maternos e neonatais, esforços de nutrição infantil, imunizações e educação em todo o mundo.",
