    "title": "'Sad' cat adopted after PSPCA social media post goes viral",
    "text": "[](/kylie-kelce-commencement-speech-cabrini-university/) []https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-vietnam-veterans-memorial-still-needs-25000-repair-extensive-vandalism-sustained-last-august-0599927/ March 14, 2024 Brian the cat spent months being overlooked at the Pennsylvania SPCA as he waited to find his fur-ever home. Just as the orange tabby's hopes of adoption seemed to be failing, Brian became an unexpected social media star. On Wednesday morning, the PSPCA shared posts about Brian — referring to him as \"sad\" and saying that the \"light in his eye\" was dimming each day — on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter). The posts soon went viral, gaining millions of views and thousands of shares across platforms. By that afternoon, Brian was in a kitty carrier leaving the Philly shelter with his new family. MORE: [Marcy the snow leopard is the newest animal at the Philadelphia Zoo](/philadelphia-zoo-marcy-snow-leopard-breeding-survival/) \"People love a heartfelt story like that,\" Sarah Brown, the PSPCA's social media coordinator, said of Brian. \"Everybody ... wants to help all these innocent animals. So I think seeing (Brian), you could see in the photo that he just looks defeated. And he captured people right away.\" Brian arrived at the PSPCA in October after the organization said its animal law enforcement team rescued a \"victim of routine neglect.\" When he arrived at the shelter, Brian was underweight and covered in fleas, according to Brown. He also had a heart murmur, asthma, respiratory infection and entropion, a medical condition in which the eyelids are curling inward. \"Sometimes when we have animals that have complicated medical histories, it can be a little daunting to potential adopters,\" Brown said. \"But you're hoping that once people got in the door, we can tell them, 'Hey, it's not that bad.' Brian's still a great cat, you just need somebody to look past all of that.\" Brian spent some time being treated in the hospital before he was placed on the adoption floor, where he went largely unnoticed by adopters. As the months rolled by, volunteers noticed a decline in the cat's morale. There's no other way to put it - Brian is sad.— Pennsylvania SPCA (@PSPCA) It's been 5 months since he has been looking for a forever home and with every day that passes, we can see the light in his eye dim little by little. We know his people are out there somewhere. We hope they find him today. [pic.twitter.com/e22Vy1uOWi] [March 13, 2024] \"One of our cat volunteers approached me last week and she was like, 'Brian is just not himself anymore,'\" Brown said. \"So I started hanging out with him. It was so sad. He was hanging out behind his litter box in the corner of his kennel. He used to love food; now he wouldn't even come out for treats or anything. I was like, I have to post this cat. We need to get him out of here. He can't be here a day longer.\" Brown said the PSPCA's social media team often tries to highlight the adoptable animals that \"need a little more help\" or that have been in the shelter for a while. For example, every week the shelter shares images of Smokey , the dog that has been at the shelter the longest. When it came to Brian, Brown wanted to get the despairing kitty's face in front of the shelter's robust online following in hopes of finding his family. So she took to Facebook just after 10:30 a.m. Wednesday posting a photo of the cat staring solemnly up at the camera with an earnest caption that read: \"There's no other way to put it - Brian is sad. It's been 5 months since he has been looking for a forever home and with every day that passes, we can see the light in his eye dim little by little. But, we made a promise to Brian the day he entered our shelter that we would stick by him, no matter how long it takes, and we will always be the guiding light when he needs it. Today, we hope to shine the light on Brian and we hope it reaches his person. We know they are out there somewhere.\" The post has gained over 2,000 comments and 10,000 shares since it was posted. Brown also shared a similar post to X, where it has since been viewed 3 million times and received pleading responses like, \"can someone adopt him i’m getting upset.\" As the post gained traction, the PSPCA received an influx of inquiries about Brian on social media and via email. Brian's new family showed up around 4 p.m. Wednesday, after messaging with the PSPCA team on Facebook to express their interest in adopting him. After a quick medical consultation, Brian was on his way to his new home. \"It worked out so well for him,\" Brown said. \"We hope that he continues to do well, and we hope we get updates so we can post them and everybody can keep following his story.\" \"Happiness is a journey, not a destination.\"— Pennsylvania SPCA (@PSPCA) Thanks to the outpour of support he received yesterday, Brian's journey to happiness is just beginning... in his new forever home. ❤ To everyone who shared or inquired about Brian, we thank you. [pic.twitter.com/iE6UrxEHAd] [March 14, 2024] The shelter has already updated Brian's fans on his new beginning. \"Thanks to the outpour of support he received yesterday, Brian's journey to happiness is just beginning ... in his new forever home,\" the PSPCA wrote on X and Facebook. \"To everyone who shared or inquired about Brian, we thank you.\" With Brian adopted, Brown said the PSPCA still has plenty of other \"sad\" dogs and cats that have been at the shelter for extended periods of time. \"Adoptions are just low across the whole nation,\" Brown said. \"So we're frequently seeing animals that are having longer lengths of stay. Luckily, we've been so fortunate to have a really good following and support on social media to help showcase some of these animals.\" Now through Sunday, the PSPCA is offering reduced adoption fees of $40 on all adult animals through a partnership with the North Shore Animal League America. The shelter is also looking for volunteers and fosters to take in animals in the short- or long-term.

    "title": "Study: $750 a month improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on? That question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized. Those who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered. “I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study. People are also reading… “It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.” About 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said. The participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly. A follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change. The study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls. That evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars. “You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him. Adler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him. After a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy. Rather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list. After six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%. The cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75. Among those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said. “It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.” In other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered. “I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.” “It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.” 20 facts about homelessness in the US 20 facts about homelessness in the US According to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022 The U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020 Conversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010 Experts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness The end of the federal eviction moratorium in August 2021 made millions of Americans' housing situations more precarious during the long tail of the COVID-19 pandemic As of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month HUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022 A greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020 Chronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020 Family and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020 50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022 6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020 In 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8% The number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "title": "Power now restored to all homes in Scotland affected by Storm Gerrit | Somerset County Gazette",
    "text": "All homes that lost power as Storm Gerrit lashed Scotland have now been reconnected, bosses at power firm SSEN have confirmed. The electricity provider said its teams had worked through “particularly challenging conditions” to restore supplies to more than 48,000 homes. A final push by staff saw the last properties without electricity reconnected by 11pm on Friday, with customers in parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen area in the Highlands all now with power again. Andy Smith, SSEN distribution’s operations director, said the storm had brought “serious disruption” with gale force winds having reached recorded speeds of 86mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire and 84mph in Lerwick, Shetland. Mr Smith said: “Storm Gerrit caused serious disruption across the north of Scotland, and I would like to say thank you to our customers for their patience while we worked through some particularly challenging conditions to reconnect them, as quickly and safely as possible. “I’m very proud of the work undertaken by SSEN’s operational teams, and for being out at all hours and in all weathers to find and fix the faults over the past few days. “I would also like to extend my gratitude to our contract partners and fellow network operators for how they supported our response.” SSEN is now encouraging customers who were left without power to apply for compensation, depending on how long they were without electricity for. Completion of work to restore electricity supplies comes ahead of the latest weather alert, with a yellow warning for rain and snow having been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. As a result of that Network Rail Scotland said speed restrictions will be in place on the West Highland Lines from 10am today until 9am on Sunday.

    "title": "El oppidum de Bailo, un asentamiento bátulo-púnico en la Sierra de la Plata, Tarifa",
    "text": "Vamos a sumergirnos en el fascinante relato de la [Silla del Papa](https://www.europasur.es/vivir-el-sur/Bolonia-Silla-Papa-ruta-senderista-vistas-espectaculares_0_1785121939.html), un auténtico tesoro arqueológico que ha iluminado nuestro entendimiento sobre la Edad del Hierro y el periodo romano-republicano en la región meridional de la península ibérica. Este enclave arqueológico, situado a escasos kilómetros de Baelo Claudia y en proximidad a la costa africana, se erige como un testimonio excepcional de casi un milenio de ocupación, desde el siglo X a.C. hasta la época de Augusto. Lo que hace extraordinaria a esta zona no es solo su extenso periodo de existencia, sino también su valiosa contribución a la comprensión de momentos clave de la historia antigua del extremo sur peninsular. En los últimos años se han llevado a cabo investigaciones y trabajos de limpieza que han revelado secretos ocultos durante siglos. En una extensión de aproximadamente 14 hectáreas hemos confirmado la excelente conservación de estructuras habitacionales y elementos de fortificación. ¡Imagina descubrir estratos arqueológicos que abarcan desde el Bronce Final hasta el cambio de era, desvelando diversas fases de ocupación a lo largo del tiempo! Una hipótesis intrigante ha surgido: ¿Podría la Silla del Papa haber sido el antiguo emplazamiento de la Bailo prerromana? Esta sugerencia, planteada por diversos investigadores, gana fuerza gracias a estudios recientes. La conexión con otros oppida cercanos, como Obba (Jimena de la Frontera), Lascuta (Alcalá de los Gazules) o Asido (Medina Sidonia), respalda la teoría, especialmente al hallar monedas libio-fenicias similares. Lo más impactante es la estructuración urbana única de la Silla del Papa en la ensenada de Bolonia, con una continuidad de ocupación que precede a la fundación de Baelo en la costa. Este descubrimiento no solo amplía nuestra comprensión de la historia antigua, sino que también añade una nueva dimensión a la rica cultura de nuestro pasado. La Silla del Papa es verdaderamente un testamento vivo de épocas pasadas que merece ser explorado en profundidad. En la cima imponente de la majestuosa Sierra de la Plata se ubica un impresionante enclave fortificado que se alza con majestuosidad, ofreciendo una vista privilegiada de la sorprendente costa. Este sitio no solo proporcionó a sus antiguos residentes un refugio estratégico, sino que también suscita nuestra curiosidad acerca de cómo lograron superar los desafíos para alcanzar tan elevada posición. Visualiza un paisaje donde las defensas naturales se entrelazan con la narrativa histórica. Las rocas que emergen y un manantial inagotable actúan como guardianes, otorgando a este asentamiento las comodidades esenciales. Las rocas, que adoptan la forma de una cresta, no solo añaden carácter al lugar, sino que también influyen en la disposición de la población. Entre dos barreras naturales, se crea un corredor angosto de aproximadamente 400 metros de longitud y que oscila entre 25 y 80 metros de ancho. Visualiza la plataforma donde habitaban estas antiguas personas, un cuenco inclinado hacia el norte, con terrazas que aún hoy en día son visibles. Aunque la topografía original se ha perdido entre capas de sedimentos, algunas áreas revelan incluso el primer piso de las viviendas, siendo un testimonio tangible de eras pasadas. Al recorrer este corredor descubrimos bloques y sillares que narran la historia de antiguos muros destruidos y abandonados. Las rocas que se alzan en el corredor presentan caras prácticamente verticales, con alturas impresionantes que oscilan entre 5 y 20 metros. Lo sorprendente es que estas formaciones rocosas fueron sistemáticamente aprovechadas para sustentar estructuras habitacionales de diversas alturas, como evidencian las numerosas muescas y entalles que han resistido valientemente el paso del tiempo. Este lugar encierra secretos fascinantes que nos invitan a explorar y reflexionar sobre la ingeniosidad de quienes lo habitaron. Imagina un antiguo barrio abrazado por formidables murallas naturales en la parte más elevada de este enclave. Este lugar, que se extiende por cuatro hectáreas, evocaba una sensación de seguridad, especialmente considerando que estas murallas eran prácticamente inaccesibles, a excepción del lado norte, el acceso principal al oppidum desde el valle y la fértil llanura de la laguna de la Janda. Las aberturas en las paredes rocosas en los lados oriental y occidental eran como portales, ingeniosamente diseñadas para cerrarse con muros en seco. Aún hoy en día, podemos observar vestigios de estos muros, con pequeños portones y accesos secundarios. No obstante, investigaciones recientes sugieren que los habitantes antiguos no se limitaban solo a la zona protegida por las rocas, sino que se expandían por áreas dentro de las murallas. Increíblemente, estas zonas vacías podrían haber servido como plazas para las tropas e incluso para el ganado, ampliando el oppidum de 4 a 12 hectáreas ¿No es asombroso? En su última etapa, este lugar experimentó su apogeo urbano. En la parte más alta, una calle se erige como el corazón de este antiguo barrio, con evidencias cerámicas que datan aproximadamente entre 175/150 y 50/25 a.C. Para añadir un toque fascinante a la historia, una torre rectangular con bloques almohadillados fue descubierta en el rincón suroeste. Los artefactos recuperados coinciden con la misma época, alrededor del siglo I a.C., sugiriendo la posibilidad de que la torre estuviera ocupada por los seguidores de Sertorio. Es crucial señalar que esta datación provisional se basa en hallazgos superficiales, por lo que se necesitan más investigaciones para confirmar estos descubrimientos. Un dato curioso: a pesar de la riqueza de hallazgos, no se encontraron rastros de terra sigillata en todo el lugar. ¡Una ausencia intrigante! Además, la Silla del Papa fue abandonada justo cuando se fundaba Baelo Claudia, la ciudad hispanorromana en la costa. ¿Coincidencia? Esta conexión nos lleva a reflexionar sobre la posibilidad de que estemos ante la primera Bailo, y posiblemente el mons Belleia, especialmente al considerar el nombre y su ubicación estratégica frente a la bahía de Tingis, al otro lado del Fretum Herculeum. Un emocionante enigma arqueológico que continúa desvelando los misterios de nuestro pasado antiguo. Sumerjámonos en el apasionante enigma histórico de la Silla del Papa y su papel fundamental durante el período de las guerras civiles romanas. Al explorar los detalles temporales, nos encontramos reevaluando el escenario propuesto por P. Sillières y L. Callegarin. Sorprendentemente, no se vislumbra ninguna señal de abandono o declive en la Silla del Papa durante la segunda mitad del siglo I a.C., en pleno período \"sertoriano\". Más bien, este período nos brinda un conjunto significativo de materiales que están relacionados con muchas de las estructuras arquitectónicas que hoy admiramos en la superficie del sitio. Es en la segunda mitad de ese mismo siglo, cuando los elementos datados comienzan a disminuir considerablemente, culminando en el abandono definitivo del oppidum durante la época \"augustea\". Frente a estos nuevos datos, es esencial abordar nuevamente este tema, considerando tanto el contexto general de la historia del estrecho de Gibraltar entre los siglos II y I a.C., como las contribuciones científicas recientes de los equipos que exploran la ensenada de Bolonia. Para comprender el papel de Baelo y la Silla del Papa en las guerras civiles, es crucial analizar las opciones de travesía del Estrecho. Aunque la parte más estrecha conecta África con la región costera entre el Peñón de Gibraltar y la Isla de las Palomas de Tarifa, resulta ser la ruta menos favorable debido a los vientos y corrientes oceánicas. La travesía marítima más equilibrada en distancia y facilidad de navegación conecta precisamente Baelo con Tingis al oeste, siendo este último el puerto preferido según Estrabón. Controlar el puerto en esta travesía se convierte en una necesidad geopolítica esencial para los poderes en busca de dominio en la región del Estrecho. Así, entendemos la importancia estratégica de los enclaves de Baelo y la necesidad de medidas defensivas específicas en la Silla del Papa. ¡Un relato intrigante que revela las complejidades y la importancia estratégica de esta región en la historia antigua. Viajemos atrás en el tiempo, unas cuantas décadas antes del tumulto de las guerras civiles en el siglo I a.C., hasta los días de las guerras lusitanas, donde los relatos de los historiadores romanos nos transportan a una época repleta de intrigas y fascinación en la región del Estrecho. Este lugar estratégico ejercía una atracción magnética tanto en las fuerzas indígenas rebeldes, conocidas como \"lusitanos\", como en los propios romanos. Nuestra ventana a este intrigante periodo se abre a través de los capítulos 55-57 de la obra ibérica de Apiano, nuestra principal fuente, aunque lamentablemente perdemos detalles en los libros de otros historiadores, como Tito Livio. En el año 154 a.C., el líder lusitano púnico realizó incursiones hasta el océano, incorporó a los vetones a su ejército y asedió a los blastofenicios, pueblos sometidos a los romanos, establecidos según se dice por Aníbal el cartaginense como colonos libio-fenicios. En el 153 o 152 a.C., otros lusitanos bajo Caucainos desafiaron a Roma, devastaron el territorio en el suroeste y atravesaron el océano cerca de las Columnas de Hércules, lanzando incursiones en África. El año 151-150 a.C. vio a L. Licinius Lucullus aniquilar a los lusitanos cerca de Gades. En el 147, Viriato derrotó a Gaius Veilius cerca de Tribola, posiblemente refugiándose los romanos en Carteia. En el 145, Fabius Maximus Aemilianus se instaló en orsôn y cruzó el estrecho hasta Gades, mientras Viriato atacaba y aniquilaba a un gran número de romanos. En este breve periodo entre el 154 y el 145, vemos dos intentos de los lusitanos de cruzar el Estrecho, logrando el éxito en una ocasión. Los romanos, en plena huida, se refugiaron en Carteia y otros, en medio de la lucha, se dirigieron a Gades para realizar sacrificios en el templo de Heracles. Un detalle interesante es la denominación de los habitantes del Estrecho como blastofenicios, un término que parece ser una mezcla entre bástulos y fenicios, explicado por Apiano como el resultado del traslado forzoso de africanos en tiempos de Aníbal. Esta secuencia histórica nos presenta una región estratégica marcada por constantes movimientos de tropas, siempre en peligro y caracterizada por incursiones y expediciones desde mediados del siglo II a.C. Este contexto arroja luz sobre los eventos finales de las guerras civiles, más de medio siglo después, especialmente el episodio de Sertorio. Imagina el frenesí de aquellos tiempos en la encrucijada del Estrecho y la Bética, donde lusitanos, romanos, mauritanos y poblaciones nativas se entrelazaron en un escenario lleno de intriga y acción. Imagina embarcarte en un emocionante viaje en el tiempo, miles de años atrás, en el sur de la península ibérica, donde se tejía una historia fascinante repleta de estrategias y desafíos. Sumerjámonos en el contexto histórico que nos revela por qué la antigua comunidad bástulo-púnica de Bailo optó por un modelo de asentamiento y organización territorial tan peculiar. En aquellos tiempos, el mar representaba una constante fuente de amenazas, y para protegerse, Bailo desplegó su ingenio con astucia. ¿Cómo? Decidieron ubicar sus recintos fortificados en lo alto de las colinas, mirando hacia el interior, mientras mantenían una vista estratégica de la costa mediante torres y otros recintos más pequeños. Visualiza la Silla del Papa, en la cima de la sierra de la Plata, dominando visualmente sobre otros enclaves fortificados. Una vista impresionante desde 457 metros sobre el nivel del mar. Al oeste de la Bailo de la época prerromana, a unos 8 km, encontramos el Peñón del Aljibe, un centro más modesto pero estratégicamente ubicado entre la costa y el río Almodóvar. Este lugar controlaba las zonas agrícolas más productivas, conectando con la campiña asidonense. La ciudad importante de Asido (la actual Medina Sidonia), más alejada de la costa, también desempeñaba un papel clave en la regulación de la conexión entre Bailo y la bahía de Cádiz por vías terrestres. El territorio circundante de Bailo, aún por explorar en detalle, está compuesto por otros asentamientos más pequeños, como Facinas, Beis y el cerro de Los Tornos. Estos lugares estratégicos, en alturas y medias alturas, junto a los vados del río Almodóvar, permitían una comunicación rápida con la bahía de Algeciras. Una red bien pensada para enfrentar los desafíos de la época. Aunque desde la cima de la Silla del Papa tenían una vista espectacular del Estrecho y la costa norteafricana, la línea de costa directa en la ensenada de Bolonia no era tan visible. Pero no te preocupes, ¡tenían todo bajo control! A lo largo de los siglos, ocupaciones costeras como la factoría de salazones del Anclón y el yacimiento de El Piojo mantenían una conexión visual estable con el oppidum. Además, en la cercana ensenada de Valdevaqueros, hacia el este en dirección a Tarifa, probablemente existía un asentamiento colonial, respaldado por la presencia de sarcófagos púnicos y la reocupación de hipogeos en la necrópolis prehistórica de Los Algarbes. La historia antigua de Bailo está llena de giros emocionantes y estratégicos. Descubramos juntos estos emocionantes capítulos del pasado. Regresemos y adentrémonos en la fascinante función de este pequeño recinto, una vez más actuando como el vínculo entre los centros coloniales en la costa y los oppida nativos. Dirijamos nuestra atención hacia la pintoresca ensenada de Valdevaqueros, donde se presume que yacía Mellaria. Imagina este lugar, donde el río del Valle se encuentra con el mar, creando un área estuarina que, influenciada por las mareas, podría haber servido como un puerto natural y punto de anclaje para barcos. Este entorno tan singular brindaba oportunidades excepcionales para el intercambio de mercancías, respaldado por la presencia de envases utilizados para salazones descubiertos en el pequeño asentamiento de Algarbes II. Visualiza la bulliciosa actividad comercial en este rincón estratégico de la antigüedad. En la época romana, la ocupación en la ensenada de Valdevaqueros cobró fuerza con la creación del complejo industrial conocido como el vicus de Mellaria, que perduró hasta el periodo del Bajo Imperio. Este lugar ha sido tradicionalmente asociado con la famosa batalla naval sertoriana. No obstante, algunos estudiosos, al considerar los descubrimientos de excavaciones arqueológicas en Tarifa, especialmente en el cerro del castillo de Guzmán el Bueno, sugieren la intrigante posibilidad de que el nombre Mellaria estuviera vinculado al propio núcleo urbano de Tarifa en lugar de Valdevaqueros. Una trama arqueológica que nos invita a explorar los misterios de la historia en la encrucijada del pasado. Embárcate en un viaje fascinante hacia la historia de la Silla del Papa, un lugar que desvela su riqueza arqueológica desde la antigua Edad del Hierro. Este enclave estratégicamente elegido destacaba por su impresionante vista panorámica y defensas naturales proporcionadas por imponentes afloramientos rocosos verticales que rodeaban gran parte del oppidum. La protección natural fue tan efectiva que no requirió la construcción de una muralla defensiva completa, complementándose con una muralla conservada en áreas menos escarpadas y torres estratégicas. Las torres en el extremo sur, datadas en la época republicana, eran esenciales para obtener una visión clara de la costa cercana. En el ángulo sureste, encontramos un intrigante edificio cuadrangular sobre la superficie rocosa, cuya conexión con el oppidum aún desconocemos. Mientras tanto, en el ángulo suroeste, sobre un pequeño promontorio en la cresta occidental del afloramiento rocoso, se identificó una impresionante torre rectangular de 8,70 x 5,60 m, construida con sillares y un almohadillado rústico. Este tipo de construcción, vinculado a sistemas de vigilancia en la época republicana, presenta paralelos en la Alta Andalucía. Acompáñanos en la exploración de las huellas del pasado en la Silla del Papa y descubre los secretos de estas antiguas estructuras de vigilancia. Hugo Alberto Mira Perales.

    "title": "Two persons of interest sought in murder investigation involving missing pregnant teen – WHIO TV 7 and WHIO Radio",
    "text": "SAN ANTONIO, Texas — Police said they are seeking two persons of interest in a capital murder case after 18-year-old Savanah Soto is believed to have been found dead days after the mom-to-be was scheduled to be induced. An 18-year-old full-term pregnant woman and a 22-year-old man were discovered dead in a vehicle in San Antonio on Tuesday, police said. An unborn child was also found deceased, police said. The Kia Optima found had been at that location for likely several days, police said. The female victim has yet to be officially identified by the medical examiner but \"I think we can be confident\" that it is Soto, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said during a press briefing Thursday. The male victim has been identified as her boyfriend -- 22-year-old Matthew Guerra -- police said. He died from a gunshot wound to the head though the medical examiner has not yet determined the manner of death, McManus said. Right now police do not believe this to be a murder-suicide though noted \"that possibility exists,\" the chief said. The case is currently being investigated as a capital murder for both victims, he said. \"It was a heinous act, it was unspeakable, the tragedy of it,\" McManus said. Police released footage on Thursday of two persons of interest being sought in connection with the case. One was captured driving the victims' Kia Optima, and the other was seen driving a dark-colored pickup truck, police said. The person of interest in the pickup truck is seen talking to the driver of the victims' car. McManus said they do not believe either victim appears in the video. McManus had called the case \"very, very perplexing\" following the discovery of the bodies. \"It was undetermined at that time whether we were going to be looking at it as a murder-suicide, or as a capital-murder investigation,\" he said Thursday. \"I think we've gotten past that point right now, unless we get evidence that would lead us to believe otherwise.\" Soto, 18, was last seen on Dec. 22 in Leon Valley, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The agency issued a CLEAR Alert -- used to help law enforcement locate someone in imminent danger or whose disappearance is involuntary -- for Soto on Monday. The pregnant teen had passed her delivery date, which \"caused significant concern among her family members after missing an essential medical appointment,\" the Leon Valley Police Department said in a press release earlier on Tuesday. Soto's mother, Gloria Cordova, told San Antonio ABC affiliate KSAT that her daughter was scheduled to be induced at a hospital this past Saturday. \"When I called her all morning she wasn't answering, was going straight to voicemail,\" Cordova told the station. \"We went to the hospital anyways. She was a no-show, and that's when I called the cops.\" Cordova said her daughter's home was clean and had been prepped for the baby's arrival. \"This is not like her,\" Cordova told KSAT. \"She was so excited to have this baby. The house was already baby-ready.\" Detectives are combing through social media and cellphone records, as well as days of surveillance video from several different locations where the victims were known to be, the chief said. \"Detectives are hopeful that surveillance video will lead to the events leading up to their death,\" McManus said.

World frontpage News UK & World News News The once-hidden Cornish beach with picture-perfect views 'could be in Bali' Pedn Vounder offers a stunning combination of crystal-clear turquoise waters and pristine white sands devonlive Bookmark Share News By Laura Mckenna Laura Mckenna 01:00, 19 JUL 2024 Bookmark (Image: Getty) Nestled along the Cornish coast, Pedn Vounder boasts is aesthetically pleasing it could easily be mistaken for the exotic shores of somewhere like Thailand or Bali. Perched below the imposing cliffs of Treryn Dinas, this beach graces the eastern end of Porthcurno Cove. The picture-perfect setting is stunning, but its beauty is ephemeral as it is only visible for a few hours each day. Accessible via a walk along the bay from Porthcurno Beach at low tide or by navigating a steep cliff path, Pedn Vounder has become a cherished spot for dedicated hikers, beach enthusiasts and the occasional naturist. However, the beach vanishes under the waves at high tide, lending it an air of mystery and enchantment for those who time their visit perfectly.

Despite its newfound fame, it remains unspoilt and untouched enough to have previously been named among the world&apos;s best beaches for two years in a row. Joining the ranks of illustrious names such as Australia&apos;s Turquoise Bay and the Philippines&apos; Secret Lagoon, Pedn Vounder earned its place on the annual &apos;The 50 Best Beaches In The World&apos; list. This ranking was compiled using a combination of media mentions, official Blue Flag statuses, social media buzz, and input from the Big 7 Travel editorial team, reports the Mirror . Isaac Clams, a travel vlogger, extolled the virtues of Pedn Vounder on TikTok. He dubbed it \"the Bali of the UK\" and showcased its unique sandbank and awe-inspiring vistas. In a brief TikTok video, he and his travel companion stand overlooking the beach. He exclaims: \"We&apos;ve just arrived at the only sandbank in the whole of the UK\" followed by an excited cheer as they take in the stunning coastline below. The secluded beach has won over nearly everyone who&apos;s visited, earning a perfect five out of five score on Tripadvisor. One visitor hailed it as \"the best of Cornwall beaches and one of the best in the world\", while another simply described it as \"breathtakingly beautiful\". The beach at Porthcurno towards Logans Rock was featured in Poldark (Image: Getty) To the east of the beach, you&apos;ll find the renowned Logan Rock, a 70-ton granite block that can be rocked back and forth by a single person. The area also had a starring role in the TV adaptation of \"Poldark,\" where it was portrayed as Nampara Cove in a dream sequence. Despite its growing popularity, Pedn Vounder still maintains its magical charm, beloved by both locals and tourists alike.
