    "text": "The Detroit Red Wings share an arena with the NBA’s Pistons, who just broke the single-season league record for most consecutive losses.\nThe Red Wings aren’t close to matching that run of futility, however it’s been a rough December for them as well. They are 2-8-1 over their last 11 games, including a 6-3 road loss to the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday.\nDetroit will try to turn things around during a pair of home games before the calendar flips to 2024. The Nashville Predators will visit on Friday and the Boston Bruins will come to town on New Year’s Eve.\nThe Red Wings experienced a third-period collapse against the Wild. They tied the game on Alex DeBrincat’s power-play goal before then allowing four goals in less than 10 minutes.\nCoach Derek Lalonde saw it coming.\n“Just our inability to manage our game,” he said. “It’s unbelievable. We were fortunate to come out of the second at 2-1. They had six Grade A’s (chances) in the second and they were all off egregious turnovers. The difference in the third is the puck ended in the back of the net off of turnovers where it did not in the second.”\nDetroit had a 14-7-3 record before its slide began. The Red Wings now are in danger of dropping to the .500 mark with a regulation loss to the Predators.\n“This was not us over the first 25 games,” Lalonde said. “We worked off a forecheck and we were a simple, predictable team. Now, it’s just blue line turnovers, high offensive zone turnovers, it’s disappointing.”\nOne of the few bright spots has been the production of Patrick Kane, who signed with Detroit as a free agent early in the month. He carries a five-game point streak (five goals, four assists) and four-game goal streak into Friday’s contest.\nThe Predators have lost their last two games and three of their last four contests. The Carolina Hurricanes posted a 5-2 win in Nashville on Wednesday.\nAll of the Hurricanes’ goals came during the first two periods.\n“I think we were a little careless at times,” Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said. “I think it was an emotional game. I thought we were excited to play, maybe a little bit too rambunctious a few different times. We took some offensive zone penalties that probably we wouldn’t like to take.”\nCarolina scored three of its goals with the man advantage.\n“Special teams, we lost that battle (Wednesday), which is frustrating,” center Ryan O’Reilly said.\nO’Reilly notched his 14th goal of the season on Wednesday. He trails only Filip Forsberg (16) for the team lead in goals.\n“I thought we did a lot of good things,” O’Reilly said. “Obviously, we’ve got to find a way to put the puck in the net a little bit better. We had some chances. Like I said, myself, I’m better than the shots I was putting on net there. Getting those point-blank opportunities and not putting them in the back of the net, I’m better than that, for sure.”\nNashville and Detroit split its two-game series last season. This will be the first of two meetings this season. The rematch will be held in Nashville on March 23.\n–Field Level Media",

    "text": "VANCOUVER — A Vancouver woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. and punk rocker Stephen Jones of The Sex Pistols alleging he sexually assaulted her as a teenager while she was a movie extra more than 40 years ago.\nA B.C. Supreme Court statement of claim filed by the plaintiff says she was 14 years old and working on the movie \"Ladies & Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains\" when Jones supplied her with marijuana, then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room.\nThe court has placed a publication ban on the woman's name.\nHer lawyer Jason Gratl said in an interview that he could not comment about why the lawsuit was brought 44 years after the alleged events.\n\"I only wanted to say one thing and it's that she kept a diary,\" Gratl said.\nThe notice of claim filed Wednesday says Paramount didn't take adequate steps to warn minors or their parents about the risks of working on the set with Jonesor impose contractual terms restricting his contact with young extras or using illicit drugs.\nNone of the allegations have been tested in court.\nParamount did not immediately return a request for comment. Jones could not be reached for comment.\nNeither Paramount, nor Jones have filed a statement of defence.\nThe lawsuit says Paramount hired Jones, who was 24 at the time, for a role in the film because of his reputation as a \"punk rocker\" who consumed excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and engaged in sexual misconduct, including with underage girls.\n\"The defendant Paramount was banking on the defendant Jones’ reputation and history to market 'The Fabulous Stains,'\" the statement says, adding the company \"also hired other well-known punk rock musicians as actors for the same purpose.\"\nThe statement says that despite this knowledge, the company did not take steps to protect young workers.\nThe movie, about disaffected teens in a punk rock band, was released in 1982.\nThe legal action says the woman is seeking damages, claiming the alleged assault \"caused her to suffer psychological injury, including loss of self-esteem, loss of self-worth, injurious self-imaging and identity, and loss of trust in intimacy and potential partners.\"\nThe lawsuit says she was hired as one of the hundreds of extras playing fans for the all-girl feminist rock band. Jones had been hired to play the role of a \"socially volatile punk rock guitar player in a fictitious all-male band, The Looters.\"\nIt says that on April 13, 1980, the teen went to the Denman Inn, \"a location under the direction and control\" of Paramount, with the intention of inviting the movie's lead actor, Diane Lane, to go roller skating.\nWhen she entered the lobby, it says Jones approached her, told her he had Lane's number in his hotel room and asked her to go with him to get it. Once they were inside his room, it says Jones gave her marijuana, and he then turned off the lights and closed the curtains.\nThe document says she understood that meant he was likely to make sexual advances, she told Jones she did not consent and was \"only 14, 1-4.\" It says despite this, he pulled her onto his bed, climbed on top of her then kissed and molested her.\n\"The plaintiff repeatedly and expressly told the defendant Jones 'no' and tried to move his hand away, and finally wriggled free from him and left the room,\" the notice of claim says.\nThe lawsuit says she was initially \"both repulsed and flattered by this unwanted sexual attention from someone she believed to be a rock star and movie star.\"\nBecause she was confused by what had happened, the document says she did not tell her parents and it wasn't until she was older that she \"felt sexually violated and sexually ashamed and angry\" about the alleged assault.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "Editorial Warns of Heart Disease Risks Associated with Yo-Yo Dieting",
    "text": "PHILADELPHIA (November 14, 2024) – A new editorial – published in Nature – suggests that frequent fluctuations in diet, commonly known as \"yo-yo dieting,\" can significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The authors, from the University of Pennsylvania Schools of Nursing and Medicine, describe how cycling between high-fat and low-fat diets in mice led to a substantial acceleration of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in arteries.\nThe authors assessed the effects of intermittent dieting on immune system responses and their impact on heart health. They discovered that yo-yo dieting can disrupt the body's immune system, leading to increased inflammation and the development of atherosclerotic plaques.\n\"These findings provide compelling evidence that the way we eat can have a profound impact on our cardiovascular health,\" said co-author Kate Townsend Creasy, PhD, Assistant Professor of Nutrition Science in Penn Nursing’s Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences. \"While previous research has linked diet to heart disease, our editorial highlights the specific dangers of yo-yo dieting and the underlying mechanisms involved.\"\nThe study's authors suggest that the intermittent nature of yo-yo dieting may disrupt the body's ability to maintain a healthy balance of immune cells, leading to chronic inflammation and increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\"While more research is needed to fully understand the implications of these findings for humans, these results are provocative and consistent with the concept that yo-yo dieting may be unhealthy,\" said co-author Daniel J Rader, MD, Professor of Medicine and Genetics at the Perelman School of Medicine. \"Maintaining a consistent, healthy diet is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular health.\"\nThe researchers hope that their article will encourage individuals to adopt a more sustainable approach to weight management and prioritize heart health through a balanced and consistent diet.\n# # #\nAbout the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing\nThe University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing is one of the world’s leading schools of nursing.

    "text": "Today is a grim day for Boeing [(BA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ba) as it faces the possibility of its first strike in nearly two decades. With a contract offer on the table that falls somewhat short of what was expected, it seems increasingly likely that a strike will go through. Investors are confident, though, and shares gained fractionally in the closing minutes of Thursday’s trading. New CEO Robert “Kelly” Ortberg, in a move that might not win him many friends, delivered an impassioned plea to workers to not go on strike. Ortberg called for workers “…not to sacrifice the opportunity to secure our future together because of the frustrations of the past.” Ortberg further called on workers to “…choose the bright future ahead,” though he acknowledged “…there are employees considering another path—and it’s one where no one wins.” Such a strike would come at a terrible time for Boeing. With mounting debt and cash flow [milestones getting pushed back](https://www.tipranks.com/news/boeing-nyseba-pushes-back-production-milestone), it would only mean trouble for Boeing, as well as airlines, who have been waiting months, if not years, for orders to get filled. NASA Plans to Stick with Boeing After the rolling calamity [that was Starliner](https://www.tipranks.com/news/boeings-nyseba-starliner-returns-to-earth-friday-sans-crew), from its delayed launches to its ignominious return to its left-behind astronauts waiting for a ride home from the biggest competitor, it would be easy to think that Boeing might be persona non grata at NASA. That is not the case, though, and NASA is still looking to Boeing for the future of space travel. The problem is that NASA does not want a single-source solution. This makes a certain amount of sense; after all, Boeing just got its skin saved by SpaceX. Who would step in to save SpaceX if, in the future, it had a Boeing moment of its own? Reasonable, certainly, and a reason to develop another supplier. And though Boeing does not look the best right now, it could become better in the future. Is Boeing a Buy, Sell, or Hold? Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on BA stock based on 14 Buys, four Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 21.87% [loss in its share price](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ba) over the past year, the [average BA price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ba/forecast) of $213.67 per share implies 31.13% upside potential.",
