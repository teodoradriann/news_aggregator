[pic.twitter.com/hSeI30lhqk] [March 9, 2024] “You must have heard of ‘Modi Ki Guarantee’ (Modi’s guarantee). You will understand its significance once you visit Arunachal. The entire Northeast bears witness to this. I laid the foundation of the Sela Tunnel here in 2019, and today it has been inaugurated,” the prime minister [declared](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pm-modi-inaugurates-sela-tunnel-worlds-longest-twin-lane-tunnel-in-arunachal-pradesh-2512608-2024-03-09) following the inauguration. It is the nation’s highest tunnel, among other things, and offers all-weather communication to the Tawang region, which is strategically important, and other forward locations that border China close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

A [statement](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-inaugurate-sela-tunnel-details-of-worlds-longest-twin-lane-tunnel-101709946678407.html) from the Prime Minister’s office stated that travellers would be able to bypass the treacherous Sela peak, which is 13,700 feet high and covered in snow. The tunnel, which is close to Sela Pass, was necessary because snowfall and landslides brought on by intense rains forced the Balipara-Charidwar-Tawang Road to stay blocked for a significant portion of the year. It is believed that the project will advance both the socio-economic growth of the area and the nation’s defence capability. The [project](https://news.abplive.com/elections/pm-modi-inaugurate-sela-tunnel-world-s-longest-twin-lane-tunnel-during-arunachal-pradesh-visit-lok-sabha-polls-1670567) is the longest twin-lane tunnel in the world to be constructed above 13,000 feet in altitude. It consists of two tunnels, Tunnel 1, a single-tube tunnel of 1,003 meters, and Tunnel 2, a twin-tube tunnel measuring 1595 meters. There is one escape tube for emergencies and one bi-lane tube for traffic in Tunnel 2. T2, the longer tube, spanning 1,594.90 meters, is accompanied by a narrower, parallel tunnel measuring 1,584.38 meters in length, designed to facilitate escape in case of a cave-in. Additionally, it entails building a 1.3-kilometre connection road to connect Tunnel 1 to Tunnel 2 as well as a seven-kilometre access road to Tunnel 1, which begins at Balipara-Chardwar-Tawang (BCT) Road. The project also includes two roads measuring 8.6 kilometres. The tunnel has been designed for a traffic density of 3,000 cars and 2,000 trucks per day, with a maximum speed of 80 kmph. According to a Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) statement, it is an engineering marvel that would allow access to Tawang through the Sela pass on the Balipara-Chariduar-Tawang Road in Arunachal Pradesh in any weather conditions. The tunnel was built with the most advanced safety measures and the recently developed Austrian Tunnelling Method. The statement mentioned, “The project will not only provide a faster and more efficient transport route in the region but is of strategic importance to the country.” The tunnel will be a lifeline as it will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang. One of India’s clear disadvantages over China along the northeast frontier was the absence of motorable roads and rail connections in Arunachal Pradesh. Additionally, experts noted that China gained a strategic edge from building access roads and other infrastructure all the way to the Indian border. This move guarantees the quick deployment of soldiers and heavy armament, including artillery guns, from 4 Corps headquarters in the Assam plains to Tawang, ensuring the prompt handling of any emergency scenarios. This tunnel will save travellers around ninety minutes of travel time in each direction by reducing the distance between Tawang and Dirang in the West Kameng region of Arunachal Pradesh by twelve kilometres. The northeast now has better infrastructural connectivity owing to new airports and train connections that have been built in the last few years under the leadership of PM Modi’s Union government. One such project that is crucial from a strategic standpoint is the Sela Tunnel. The project enables all-weather access to the Tawang region, which China claims to be its ancient territory. The Sela Pass has historically been closed during a few winter months. However, the project will offer a fresh alignment on the axis heading towards the LAC, guaranteeing the smooth passage of military troops and equipment all year round. The path leads through Sela, a mountain pass tucked away in Arunachal Pradesh at a height of almost 14,000 feet, and is the location of recent skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops. This area has extremely harsh weather, with temperatures as low as -20 degrees Celsius that cause diesel to freeze and severe snowfall that makes movement impossible. The Indian Army will now have a key link between Tawang and Guwahati, Assam, due to the building of the all-weather Sela Tunnel, which will provide continuous connectivity year-round. On 9th February 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi placed the project’s foundation stone, however, its completion was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The excavation operations on Tunnel 1 started on 15th January 2021, following the first explosion. Tunnel 2’s breakthrough burst took place on 14th October 2021 and was carried out by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during an e-ceremony from India Gate, signalling the end of Tunnel 2’s excavation. The project has a total length of almost 12 kilometres which consists of two tunnels and more than eight kilometres of approach roads. Notably, many tunnels, bridges and highways are now being built in forward areas as part of a major effort to reduce the enormous border infrastructure gap with China. The government gave its approval in February of last year to build a 4.1-kilometre tunnel under the challenging Shinkun La pass, which separates Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh. The tunnel is expected to cost Rs 1,681 crore. Furthermore, he also launched the UNNATI scheme worth over Rs 10,000 crore. He also unveiled multiple development projects in various states including Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh during the ‘Viksit Bharat Viksit North East’ programme. During the ‘Viksit Bharat Viksit North East’ programme in Arunachal Pradesh today, PM Modi is expected to inaugurate, dedicate, and lay the foundation stone of several other development projects worth approximately Rs 55,600 crore in Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh, as per the PMO’s press release. Moreover, he is going to visit Jorhat in the adjacent state of Assam, where he will dedicate a statue honouring the late Ahom general Lachit Borphukan. Furthermore, the PM will introduce and officially launch several development initiatives in Assam valued at over Rs 17,500 crore.",

PATNAIK 13 Dec 2024 8:37 PM IST x A fresh low-pressure area is developing in the Bay of Bengal, which is expected to bring heavy rainfall to south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema on December 16 and 17, according to an IMD Amaravati report issued on Friday. (Image: DC) Visakhapatnam: A fresh low-pressure area is developing in the Bay of Bengal, which is expected to bring heavy rainfall to south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema on December 16 and 17, according to an IMD Amaravati report issued on Friday.\nThe report states that an upper-air cyclonic circulation is likely to form over the south Andaman Sea around December 14 and develop into a low-pressure area within the next 48 hours. This system is expected to move west-northwest towards the Tamil Nadu coast. Currently, the low-pressure area over the Gulf of Mannar and the adjoining Comorin area has shifted over the Lakshadweep and Maldives region. The associated upper-air cyclonic circulation extends up to 5.8 km above mean sea level and is expected to move westward and weaken over the next 24 hours. Over the past 24 hours, several towns in Rayalaseema and south coastal Andhra Pradesh have been hit by heavy rainfall. Sullurpeta (Tirupati) recorded the highest rainfall at 14.3 cm, followed by Tada (Tirupati) with 11.5 cm, Thottambedu (Tirupati) with 10.7 cm, Srikalahasti (Tirupati) with 10.1 cm, Venkatagiri (Tirupati) with 9.6 cm, Koduru (YSR district) with 8.8 cm, Tirupati Airport with 8.3 cm, and Nagari (Chittoor) with 7.3 cm. In south coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rapur (SPSR Nellore district) recorded 9.7 cm. Private weather website Skymet reported that many parts of Tamil Nadu were lashed by heavy to very heavy rains in the past 24 hours. The website also noted a cyclonic circulation over the Southeast Bay of Bengal and South Andaman Sea, which is expected to reach the central parts of South Bay on Saturday and move towards the eastern coast of Sri Lanka on December 15. Another wave of heavy weather activity is expected for Tamil Nadu, it added.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Han pasado seis meses desde que Ana Knezevich desapareció de España. Su esposo fue arrestado por su secuestro meses después de su desaparición. Hasta el día de hoy, no ha sido encontrada.\nLa misteriosa desaparición de la mujer de 40 años de Fort Lauderdale ocurrió en medio de un polémico divorcio de su esposo, David Knezevich.\nRecommended Videos\nSu familia ofreció una conferencia de prensa el jueves.\n“¿Dónde está mi hermana?” Dijo el hermano de Ana Knezevich, Felipe Henao. Han pasado más de seis meses. Está desaparecida desde hace más de medio año.\nLos fiscales alegan que David Knezevich arrebató a su esposa de su apartamento y pintó con aerosol las cámaras de seguridad de su edificio. Se declaró inocente de un cargo federal de secuestro.\n“Nadie ha visto ni oído hablar de Ana desde el día en que su esposo condujo en secreto a través del continente y fue visto desactivando su seguridad”, dijo Adam Ingber, abogado de la familia.\nLos fiscales dijeron que David Knezevich condujo cerca de 5.000 millas desde su Serbia natal hasta España en un automóvil alquilado y lo devolvió con matrículas diferentes.\nMientras la familia espera noticias sobre su paradero, les preocupa que pueda ser liberado de la custodia federal para esperar el juicio.\nEn la audiencia de detención de la semana pasada, los abogados de David Knezevich discutieron sobre si él tiene acceso a suficiente dinero para ser considerado un riesgo de fuga.\nIngber dijo que la pareja administraba una cartera de bienes raíces multimillonaria y David está ocultando dinero y tiene acceso a fondos de las ventas de propiedades, diciendo que recibió millones en efectivo de transacciones inmobiliarias.\nSegún los informes, David Knezevich afirma que el dinero se ha ido, pero Ingber dijo que cree que se está ocultando para que parezca que no tiene dinero.\nLa defensa está rechazando la acusación, citando la falta de evidencia forense contra David Knezevich para mantenerlo en la cárcel, incluida una reciente revelación de que no se encontró sangre en el apartamento de su esposa.\nSi es liberado, la familia de Ana Knezevich teme que haya represalias.\n“¿Cómo puedes amar a alguien y luego nunca buscarlo, nunca hacer nada al respecto?” Dijo Henao.\nEl abogado de David Knezevich no respondió a una solicitud de comentarios de Local 10 News. Un juez aún no se ha pronunciado sobre una audiencia de detención.\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "París, 22 de Febrero (EFE).- Francia expulsó de su territorio al imán tunecino al que reprochaba declaraciones contra los valores republicanos y llamamientos al odio, que se podrían equiparar a un delito de apología del terrorismo, con comentarios que tachaban de satánica la bandera francesa.\n“El ‘imán’ radical Mahjoub Mahjoubi acaba de ser expulsado del territorio nacional”, anunció a última hora de este jueves en la red social X el ministro de Interior galo, Gérald Darmanin, quien advirtió también- “No dejaremos pasar ni una».\nLa\nexpulsión del religioso de origen tunecino, al que se abrió una investigación el lunes pasado por apología del terrorismo, se produjo tan solo doce horas después de que hubiera sido puesto bajo custodia policial con vistas al procedimiento para hacer efectiva su salida del país.\nDarmanin destacó la velocidad del trámite y aseguró que “no habría sido posible” sin las disposiciones de la nueva ley de inmigración impulsada por su\nMinisterio.\nMahjoub Mahjoubi residía en la localidad de Bagnols sur Cèze y había protagonizado una controvertida grabación, emitida en directo por Facebook el pasado 9 de febrero, donde calificaba de “satánica» la bandera francesa y decía que no tiene “ningún valor para Alá».\nA la vista de la reacción que provocó el mensaje, el imán rectificó en declaraciones a la prensa y se excusó en una mala utilización del lenguaje y en “un problema de formulación».\nTambién dijo que en realidad no se refería a la bandera francesa, sino a las que se han visto en las últimas semanas durante la Copa Africana de Naciones.\nSin embargo, el prefecto del departamento de Gard, Jérôme Bonet, precisó el pasado martes, al confirmar que se había iniciado el trámite para su expulsión por sus llamamientos al odio, que la decisión de las autoridades francesas no se basaba únicamente en ese controvertido vídeo, sino que se le había hecho un seguimiento durante meses por radicalismo.",
