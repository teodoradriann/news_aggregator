    "text": "By Ben Crnic ,\n16 minutes ago\nAhead of a strong storm system expected to bring a deluge of rain to the region, Westchester officials are warning residents to hunker down and prepare for flash flooding.\nIn an announcement on Friday, March 22, the Westchester County Department of Emergency Services advised residents to expect downpours beginning on Friday night and continuing through Saturday, March 23.\nRelated Report - Flood Threat Increases For Potent Storm With Heavy Rainfall, Gusty Winds Taking Aim At Region The upcoming storm system has prompted a Flood Watch to be issued in Westchester until Saturday at 10 p.m., and is predicted to bring a half-inch of rain every hour, officials said.\nThis will likely cause small rivers and streams in the county to overflow and cause flash flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas. Additionally, parkways such as the Bronx River and Saw Mill River Parkways will likely experience flooding from the heavy rain.\nBecause of this, officials warned residents to avoid driving on parkways if possible.\n\"Better yet, don’t drive in heavy rain if you don’t have to do so,\" officials added.\nThe department also gave tips to follow in case you encounter flooding at your home or on roads:\nIf you live in a basement apartment or in an area that often experiences flooding, make sure you are aware of the conditions around you to stay safe; Clear any catch basins and culverts of debris that could stop drainage during periods of heavy rain; Do not walk or drive through standing or moving water, and do not pass road closure barricades. Department of Emergency Services personnel will monitor conditions and be ready to help local communities throughout the storm, officials said.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Captain Pat Cummins' second 10-wicket total in test matches led Australia to a 79-run win over Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on the fourth day of the second cricket test on Friday. Cummins made all the crucial breakthroughs late in the day as the hosts bowled Pakistan out for 237 to win the Boxing Day test and extend Pakistan's losing run in Australian tests to 16 matches. [Was Mohammad Rizwan Out or Not Out? Third Umpire’s Decision During Australia vs Pakistan 2nd Test 2023 Leaves Fans Divided](https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/was-mohammad-rizwan-out-or-not-out-third-umpires-decision-during-australia-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-2023-leaves-fans-divided-5657965.html). Mohammad Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha threatened to push Pakistan towards a win but Cummins ended the 67-run partnership between the pair in bizarre and dramatic fashion just 15 minutes before the scheduled close of play. Australia reviewed a not out call to Rizwan as a Cummins delivery flew into Alex Carey's gloves. But after a long review from the third umpire, Richard Illingworth deemed the ball flicked Rizwan's wrist band that was connected to his gloves. Rizwan was the furious with the decision, with Pakistan 219-5 at the time and starting to believe it could pull off the country's highest successful winning chase against Australia. “I got a little bit twitchy there,” Cummins said. “I felt OK but they were batting nicely. Happy with the Rizwan wicket.” It was Cummins who claimed the crucial wicket of his opposing captain Shan Masood (60), before tea. Cummins took his fourth of the second innings just minutes later, dismissing Aamir Jamal (0). The wickets earned him the player of the match award and made him the 10th Australian to pass 250 test wickets. At seven wickets down, Australia opted to take the extra 30 minutes in a bid to complete the match on Friday instead of coming back for day five. \"The game kept turning. Sometimes it went Australia's way, sometimes ours. But when we were leading with bat when me and Abdullah had a good partnership (in the first innings), Pat Cummins came in with that spell. And that is why he is one of the best bowlers in the world.\" Masood said. Australia was out for 262 in its second innings after losing 4-75 during the morning. Wicketkeeper Alex Carey (53) helped push Australia's lead over the crucial 300-mark with his highest score since the first test of the Ashes in June. Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Afridi (4-76) made a return to form with his best figures of the series, while fellow left-armer Mir Hamza added 4-32.

Australia won the first test in Perth by 360 runs. The third test in the three-match series is scheduled to begin Jan. 3 at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where Pakistan won its last test in Australia in 1995.

The real surprise was for the residents of places like Jadavpur and Kudghat, where ice in the form of hail was seen with the rain. According to the data received from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, the highest rainfall was recorded at Ballygunge. This part of the city received 75mm of rainfall followed by Mominpore that was drenched with 68mm of precipitation.\nDhapa in the Eastern fringes of the city also received 67mm of rainfall from 1pm to 3pm. While the downpour continued in several pockets of Kolkata for two hours from, many places, including Palmer Bazar, Dhapa, Maniktala, Topsia and Thanthania received higher rainfall between 1pm to 2pm. The city sky remained overcast for greater parts of the day with drizzles continuing even after 3pm in a few pockets.\nAccording to the Regional Meteorological Centre, the cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh and its neighbourhood now lies over the eastern parts of the country while another trough line runs from east Assam to north Odisha, across Gangetic West Bengal. The dual weather system is responsible for favourable synoptic conditions and strong moisture incursion from Bay of Bengal and would bring thunderstorm, lightning, gusty wind and thunder squall activity in various districts of south Bengal. The weather office has issued an orange warning of thunder squall with speed reaching 50-60 kmph in nine districts of south Bengal for tomorrow. The city of Kolkata has also been given an orange alert of the thunder squall for tomorrow. As per the weather scientists, the rainfall and thunderstorm are likely to be more intense till tomorrow. From Friday, the rainfall is anticipated to get reduced in Kolkata.",

    "text": "Londres, 20 Ene. (EUROPA PRESS) – El Ministerio de Defensa británico ha informado de que ha realizado una prueba exitosa de un nuevo sistema de láser de alta potencia contra un objetivo aéreo en lo que podría servir como alternativa a los costosos sistemas de defensa antiaérea actuales, ineficaces ante drones de bajo coste. El sistema DragonFire tiene la precisión necesaria para impactar a una moneda de una libra desde un kilómetro de distancia. Ahora ha sido probado con éxito en campo de tiro de las islas Hébridas, en Escocia, lo que supone un «gran paso» hacia su uso militar. El ministro de Defensa británico, Grant Shapps, ha destacado que esta tecnologia reduce «la dependencia de caras municiones y reduce el riesgo de daños colaterales». El DragonFire podría estar próximamente integrado en el sistema de defensa del Ejército de Tierra y de la Marina, ha resaltado Londres, con lo que se sumaría a Estados Unidos, que ya cuenta con esta tecnología en varios destructores de la Marina. Actualmente los misiles y proyectiles antiaéreos utilizados en conflictos como el de Yemen o Ucrania cuestan mucho más que los drones que derriban, por lo que varios países investigan alternativas más eficaces. El DragonFire en concreto ha recibido ya inversiones por 100 millones de libras (unos 116 millones de euros).",

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": " Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/). ",

    "title": "Solar flare on New Year's Eve was largest since 2017: What to know",
    "text": "A powerful burst of energy on New Year's Eve created the largest solar flare that has been detected since 2017. The event may sound serious, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) clarified that the general public had nothing to fear. However, the agency did put out a warning that the flare did pose the threat of temporarily disrupting high-frequency radio signals. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center also released an image of the flare Sunday, which appeared as a glowing spot on the sun's surface. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory similarly captured an image of the massive flare, which the space agency colorized in yellow and orange to emphasize the extreme intensity of the heat and ultraviolet light that the flare emitted. Recapping 2023's wild year in space: From UFOs, to commercial spaceflight, and to rogue tomatoes Considered our solar system's largest explosive events , solar flares occur when magnetic energy associated with sunspots is released, creating intense bursts of radiation. Solar flares can last mere minutes, or can drag on for hours, depending on their intensity. NASA classifies solar flares based on their strength, with B-class being the smallest and X-class – which is what was detected Sunday – being the largest. Weaker solar flares won't be noticeable here on Earth, but those with enough energy output to rank as an X-class have the potential to disrupt radio communications, electric power grids and navigation signals. In extreme cases, such powerful flares even pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts, according to NASA. Each letter represents a ten-fold increase in energy output and includes a scale of 1 to 9 in each class. The exception is the X-class since there are flares that have been recorded exceeding 10 times the power of an X-1. The most powerful of those occurred in 2003, when the sensors measuring it overloaded, accoding to NASA. The flare was later estimated to be about an X-45, which could have packed enough of a wallop to create long-lasting radiation storms that harm satellites and even give airline passengers flying near the poles small doses of radiation. X-class flares also have the potential to create global transmission problems and world-wide blackouts, NASA says. Fortunately, Sunday's solar flare didn't come close to that 2003 output. But the flare, rated as an X-5, was the strongest to be observed since Sept. 10, 2017 when an X8.2 flare occurred, according to NOAA. The agency also tied the flare to the same region that produced an X-2.8 flare on Dec. 14 that caused radio blackouts in South America. Solar flares and other solar activity, such as solar storms, are only expected to become more common by 2025 as the Sun reaches the height of its 11-year cycle, known as the solar maximum. The growing activity has brought with it fears of a potential \"internet apocalypse\" if a lengthy outage is triggered. Eric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.
