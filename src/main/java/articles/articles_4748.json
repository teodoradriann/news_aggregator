    "text": "A female panda cub born on June 18 in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, has grown from 178 grams since birth to 1230 grams as of Thursday, showing healthy conditions. (Photo by Zheng Erqi/chinadaily.com.cn) A grand ceremony was held at a safari park in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, on Thursday to celebrate the first month of a female panda cub born to Mengmeng, the eldest of the world's only giant panda triplets. Mengmeng gave birth to the cub at the Guangzhou Chimelong Safari Park on June 18 after a 128-day pregnancy. According to the park's conservation team, the cub has grown from 178 grams to 1,230 grams as of Thursday, indicating healthy conditions. The park held a traditional Cantonese ceremony by distributing red eggs to visitors as a symbol of celebration and good luck. In Chinese folklore, red eggs are considered auspicious and symbolize blessings, happiness, and peace. They are often given during childbirth or after the baby's first month as a blessing from friends and family for a lifetime of peace, happiness, and prosperity. The park will also organize a ceremony at the end of July to celebrate the 10th birthday of the giant panda triplets Mengmeng, Shuaishuai, and Kuku. Zhang Ningxin contributed to this story.

    "text": "**HEAT ADVISORY FROM 11AM TO 7PM FRIDAY** ** LEVEL 1/5 RISK FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TODAY** Morning temperatures are sitting near 80s degrees today with mostly sunny, yet hazy skies thanks to the influx of the Saharan Air Layer. By this afternoon we will have not only a Heat Advisory in effect but also a risk for severe weather. Yet again, our high temperatures today will feel like close to 110 degrees. As it has been all week, wearing light colored, loose fitting clothing, hydrating, and taking breaks in doors will be key to avoiding heat related illnesses. Starting around lunchtime a line of showers and storms will develop and travel south and east throughout the late afternoon. A cold front, the main forcing behind our severe weather risk today, will move into the area around 4/5 pm and travel south and east bringing scattered storms with the potential to turn severe during dinnertime and lasting into the bedtime hours. The greatest threats with this line are gusty winds, torrential rain, ponding on roads, and plenty of flashes of lightning. Our risk is a level 1/5. We will see just slightly cooler temperatures this weekend with barely lower humidity meaning that the general hot, humid, and hazy forecast continues. We will stay dry from rain throughout the weekend with high temperatures in the low 90s, feeling like the 100s. FRIDAY: Sunny, hazy AM. Heat Advisory and possible severe storms by afternoon. Highs feeling like up to 109. Wind: WSW 5-10 mph. TONIGHT: Scattered rain and clouds. Lows in the low 70s. Wind: N 5 mph.",
