    "text": "Leonardo Fabbri centra il secondo posto nel peso e il quarto 'podio' consecutivo in Wanda Diamond League, Mattia Furlani e Ayomide Folorunso lo raggiungono nella finale in programma a Bruxelles venerdì 13 e sabato 14: sono i verdetti del Weltklasse di Zurigo, penultima tappa del massimo circuito mondiale, l'ultima che metteva in palio punti per il weekend che assegna i Diamanti. In una serata piovosa e fredda, con il termometro a 17 gradi, Fabbri lancia a 21,86 su pedana bagnata, battuto soltanto dal campione olimpico Ryan Crouser (Usa, 22,66) e conquista anche stavolta un piazzamento tra i primi tre, come già accaduto nelle precedenti tappe di Londra, Chorzow e Roma. Nel lungo, il bronzo olimpico Furlani è quinto con 7,91 (-0.3), quinta anche Ayomide Folorunso nei 400 ostacoli con 55.26.\n Allo stato attuale, oltre a Fabbri, Furlani e Folorunso, sono qualificati anche Gianmarco Tamberi nell'alto e Larissa Iapichino nel lungo, ma altri azzurri potranno aggiungersi in caso di rinunce. Non riescono invece a guadagnare la finale Lorenzo Simonelli a cui non basta l'ottavo posto nei 110 ostacoli (13.45/-0.3) e Zane Weir decimo nel peso con 18,98. Il botswano Letsile Tebogo vola nei 200 con 19.55 (+0.4), migliore prestazione mondiale dell'anno per la keniana Beatrice Chebet nei 5000 con 14:09.52: entrambi saranno domenica in gara a Brescia.\n Non smette di impressionare il campione olimpico Letsile Tebogo (Botswana), favoloso 19.55 (+0.4) nei 200 metri, quarta vittoria in Diamond League in due settimane dopo le Olimpiadi di Parigi, stasera con una sensazionale rimonta nei quaranta metri finali sullo statunitense Kenneth Bednarek (19.57). Ampiamente sotto i venti secondi anche gli altri sprinter Usa Erriyon Knighton (19.79) e Fred Kerley (19.81), e il dominicano Alexander Ogando (19.87).\n Nei 5000 fa tutto da sola negli ultimi due chilometri la keniana Beatrice Chebet, doppio titolo olimpico a Parigi: sfuma il suo assalto al record del mondo ma termina comunque in un magistrale 14:09.52, cifra della migliore prestazione mondiale dell'anno.\n Nei 100 esce forte nel finale Sha'Carri Richardson (Usa) che con 10.84 (+0.4) rimonta sulla britannica Dina Asher-Smith (poi terza in 10.89) superata anche dall'oro olimpico Julien Alfred (Saint Lucia) seconda in 10.88. Nell'asta, la 'notizia' è che lo svedese Mondo Duplantis non oltrepassa i 6 metri (ok a 5,82), a causa delle condizioni proibitive per la gara di asta. Nei 400hs senza il norvegese Karsten Warholm (che rinuncia dopo i 100 metri-show di ieri vinti dallo stesso Duplantis e che sfila con la maglia svedese per aver perso la… scommessa) e con il brasiliano Alison Dos Santos che si ferma dopo cinque ostacoli, ne approfitta il ventenne giamaicano Roshawn Clarke (47.49). Non esagera il norvegese Jakob Ingebrigtsen dopo il record del mondo dei 3000 in Slesia: nei 1500 è battuto ancora (3:29.52), stasera dallo statunitense Yared Nuguse (3:29.21) che lo infila in volata. Portoricani i 100hs con Jasmine Camacho-Quinn (12.36/+0.8), keniani gli 800 con Mary Moraa (1:57.08).\n Nell'alto, sotto una pioggia battente, 1,96 per l'ucraina primatista del mondo e oro olimpico Yaroslava Mahuchikh.\n Giavellotto: il grenadino Anderson Peters (85,72) di misura sul tedesco Julian Weber (85,33).",

    "text": "State water quality officials advise the public to avoid swimming in North Carolina coastal waters from the Wright Memorial Bridge in Kitty Hawk to the South Carolina line due to heavy rain accompanying Tropical Storm Debby.\nThe N.C. Department of Environmental Quality said testing will begin as soon as conditions are safe. The advisory will remain in effect until results are available.\n“Since the impacts are widespread, it is not possible to post signs in all areas,” the agency said in a release.\nRecreational water quality officials sample 215 sites throughout the coastal region, most on a weekly basis, from April to October.\nStormwater runoff can contain harmful bacteria as it drains into coastal water bodies, the release said.\n“The excess rain has caused flooding of streets, yards and housing that have resulted in some municipalities having to pump flood waters into the ocean and sounds,” the release said. “Avoid swimming near ocean outfalls, including the wet sand where the floodwater is pumped, even if no sign is posted.”\nAt Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the National Park Service is advising visitors to stay out of the ocean at the north end of Rodanthe, near Corbina Drive, due to a compromised septic system.\n“Visitors to Rodanthe should avoid the beach between the north end of Rodanthe and South Shore Drive until conditions improve,” the release said.\nIn addition to potential bacteria, dangerous rip currents and rough seas are forecast for the weekend, prompting red “No Swimming” flags Thursday across the Outer Banks.",
