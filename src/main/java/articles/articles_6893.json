    "title": "Planned Parenthood Officials Admit They “Pull Off a Leg or Two” to Sell Aborted Baby Parts for More Profit",
    "text": "Newly-released undercover footage, which Planned Parenthood sought to block for eight years, shows the organization’s Houston, TX branch describing delivering late-term fetuses intact and alive and mutilating the bodies afterwards to cover up violations of the federal partial-birth abortion law, in conversations about selling fetal body parts.\nIn the footage of two conversations filmed at the National Abortion Federation’s 2015 commercial trade show, undercover reporters posing as laboratory wholesalers speak with Dr. Ann Schutt-Aine, the Chief Medical Officer of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, and Tram Nguyen, RN, the branch’s Vice President of Abortion Access.\nIn the first conversation, the undercover reporter, from The Center for Medical Progress, tells Nguyen and Dr. Schutt-Aine, “Liver is in short demand,” describing competition for fetal organs and cells based on what is “more profitable” for suppliers. Dr. Schutt-Aine responds, telling Nguyen: “[Y]ou told me about the proposition, and so now every time a do a D&E [dilation and evacuation abortion], I’m like, ‘Oh there’s some lungs, there’s some kidneys.’”\nNguyen then apologizes for a highly dismembered fetus she showed CMP undercover reporters during a site visit to the clinic a few weeks prior, saying other days the aborted fetuses may be delivered with only one limb missing: “We just had to hurry up, whereas other days it’s more intact, where it’s like maybe only like an arm that’s disarticulated.”\nNguyen remarks later, “I’m like, ‘Yeah, I have like a leg for you!’ I’m like, oh sh**, if other people were to hear me, they’d be like, you are f***ing evil.”\nIn the second conversation, another CMP undercover reporter asks Nguyen and Dr. Schutt-Aine how to obtain the most intact late-term aborted fetuses for organ harvesting.\n“A lot of it has to do with dilation” of the mother’s cervix, the opening to the uterus, Dr. Schutt-Aine explains: “Because when you have good dilation, a cervix that’s either well-dilated and/or just softer and more pliable, then as you bring the fetus down, you can get more of it out before disarticulation occurs.”\nDr. Schutt-Aine states it may typically take 3 or 4 “passes” of the forceps into the mother’s body to remove the fetus. Nguyen then volunteers: “There are some that are like, I need you to make one more pass, one more pass,” to which Dr. Schutt-Aine clarifies, “To avoid PBA,” the acronym for the federal Partial-Birth Abortion law. Nguyen exclaims, “Yeah, I was like, ‘Uh, getting a little bit too close!’”\nDr. Schutt-Aine then explains further: “If I’m doing a procedure, and I’m seeing that I’m in fear that it’s about to come to the umbilicus [navel], I might ask for a second set of forceps to hold the body at the cervix and pull off a leg or two, so it’s not PBA.”\nVideo Player 00:00 06:04\nDelivering a fetus alive past the navel, with intent to take any action after that will kill the fetus, is a violation of the federal partial-birth abortion law (18 U.S.C. 1531).\nDr. Schutt-Aine also states “I have zero experience with dig[oxin],” the chemical sometimes used to kill the fetus before pulling it out of the mother with forceps and thus comply with the federal partial-birth abortion law. When the CMP undercover reporter describes a laboratory unable to harvest stem cells from a fetus that received digoxin because, “It was all completely dead, nothing,” Nguyen coughs, laughs, and replies, “Yeah,” raising her eyebrows and nodding.\nNguyen later states, “When you have patients who cooperate, and there’s good dilation, it’s just like one pass,” of the forceps to remove the fetus, motioning with her hands, to which the CMP reporter asks, “And you get the whole thing?” and Nguyen replies, “Yeah.”\nA few weeks after this conversation, in June 2015, CMP emailed Nguyen and Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast VP of Research Melissa Farrell an undercover contract for $750 per fetal liver and $1,600 per pair of fetal liver and thymus. In unsealed emails produced in federal court, Nguyen forwarded the contract to PPGC’s Regional Medical & Surgical Services Director, Dyann Santos, writing, “FYI—we’re still trying to move forward with this,” to which Santos asked, “Do you want to do this?” and to which Nguyen replied, “Yes ma’am.”\n“Planned Parenthood repeatedly told Congress, the courts, and the public that it had ‘rebuffed’ any opportunity to sell aborted baby body parts in Texas,” notes CMP founder and project lead David Daleiden. “This finally-released undercover footage shows that in reality, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast was ghoulishly eager to rip healthy babies out of vulnerable patients whole and alive, and mutilate their bodies after to sell body parts for top dollar. Kamala Harris, as California Attorney General, raided my home and seized this footage to try to block it from release for eight years, on orders from Planned Parenthood and NAF. It’s time for justice under the law for Big Abortion.”\nIn 2015, the National Abortion Federation, stating it was representing institutional member Planned Parenthood, sought and received a federal injunction against the release of the footage in San Francisco federal court. Nguyen, Dr. Schutt-Aine, and Santos have all served as Board Directors of NAF. At the same time, Planned Parenthood requested then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris’ office to seize from Daleiden the digital media containing the videos. Two weeks after a March 2016 meeting with top Planned Parenthood California officials implicated in the videos, AG Harris’ office conducted the raid on Daleiden’s home.\nHowever, Congress had also subpoenaed the footage from CMP in late 2015. In May of this year, the San Francisco District Court finally ruled that CMP cannot be prevented from republishing any of the subpoenaed footage released by Congress.\nThe Center for Medical Progress is the non-profit citizen journalism organization responsible for the 2015 undercover video series showing top Planned Parenthood officials negotiating the harvesting and sale of aborted fetal body parts.",

    "title": "‘I'm in good shape': Biden takes questions about his mental and physical fitness",
    "text": "President Joe Biden vigorously defended his fitness for office in a high-stakes press conference Thursday evening, feeling several questions about his age and calls for him to step aside.\n“I think I’m the most qualified person to run for president,” he said, adding that he believes he is the best candidate to beat former President Donald Trump in November. “I beat him once, and I will beat him again.”\nEarly in the press conference, in a moment that was immediately seized on by his opponent Donald Trump, he flubbed the name of Vice President Kamala Harris.\nBiden defended himself on questions about his health and whether he could continue to work aggressively through another term.\nnews 4 hours ago Biden stumbles over Zelenskyy introduction, calls him ‘President Putin' Decision 2024 8 hours ago Biden says during press conference he's going to ‘complete the job' despite calls to bow out Biden said he has taken three “significant and intense neurological exams,” most recently in February, and would take another one only if his doctors recommend it. “They say I’m in good shape,” he said.\nStill, he lamented that “no one’s going to be satisfied” with whatever medical information he release, suggesting his opponents will find reasons to doubt it.\nThe press conference comes as the embattled president doggedly tries to assuage the public and his own party that after a disastrous debate performance, he has the mental and physical stamina to be commander in chief and defeat Trump.\nIn the two weeks since the debate, Biden has seen several members of his own party call on him to leave the race but Biden insists he isn’t going anywhere.\nFollow live coverage and watch Biden’s press conference on NBCNews.com.\nHe chalked up his “stupid mistake” in last month’s debate to his “full bore” schedule and need to rest more.\n“I’ve just got to pace myself a little bit more. That’s what it was about,” he said in response to a question about reports that he told allies he needed to shorten his schedule. “Where has Trump been? Riding around on his golf cart.”\nHe also cast some blame on his staff for over-scheduling him. “I love my staff but they add things. They add things all the time,” he said, before stopping himself. “I’m catching hell from my wife.”\nLater, though, he acknowledged the demanding nature of the job.\n“If I slow down, I can’t get the job done. That’s a sign that I shouldn’t be doing it. But there’s no indication of that yet, none,” he said.\nHe was asked if he worried about his legacy if he stayed in the race, resisting calls from fellow Democrats to step aside, and ends up losing to Trump.\n“I’m not in this for my legacy. I’m in this to complete the job I started,” the president added.\nStill, Biden made two gaffes Thursday evening alone that are likely to overshadow the message he wanted to send.\nAfter opening remarks, read from a teleprompter, Biden’s first question was about whether he was confident Vice President Kamala Harris could replace him if necessary. Biden conflated her name with his opponent’s.\n“Look, I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be Vice President, to — think she was not qualified to be president. Let’s start there,” Biden said in response to the first question.\nHours earlier, at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Washington, Biden appeared to confuse the leaders of Ukraine and Russia.\n“Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,” Biden said as he introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a on Thursday.\nThe president stepped away from the podium before turning back around and corrected himself. “President Putin? He’s gonna beat President Putin! President Zelenskyy.”\n“I’m better [than Putin],” Zelenskyy joked as he shook Biden’s hand.\nBiden has been the world’s leading champion of Ukraine throughout two years of bloody warfare to turn back an invasion from Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin.\nAt Biden’s last press conference, in February, where the president angrily denounced a special counsel report that called him “significantly limited,” Biden referred to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi as the “president of Mexico.”\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com .

While nothing is set in stone as of yet, Sandia Peak has partnered with Mountain Capital Partners (MCP) — a ski area management company — with designs on opening for the 2023-24 season.

    "text": "Everyone has heard that cats hate water, but do they really? The statement is a generalization that assumes all cats are the same. However, cats are individuals. Some cats avoid water, while others love it, as shown in this YouTube video . This plucky cat dives right off the side of the boat and begins swimming like an otter, paddling away with its front and back paws. While not every cat is a feline version of Michael Phelps, all cats can swim. So, if they can all do it, why are we so surprised to see it? Although their common ancestor lived approximately 10 million years ago, domestic cats and their big cat cousins share several physical and behavioral characteristics. Genome sequencing revealed that house cats and Amur tigers ( Panthera tigris altaica ), also known as Siberian tigers, actually share 95.6% of their DNA. Another thing domestic cats and big cats share is partially webbed paws. More surface area means they can push more water and propel themselves more efficiently. Tigers, along with jaguars and leopards, are excellent swimmers. Tigers frequently enter the water to cool off, play, or hunt. As the largest of the big cats, tigers’ powerful, muscular bodies can quickly overheat, making access to water a necessity. There are also smaller wild cats that have adapted to a semi-aquatic lifestyle. The fishing cat ( Prionailurus viverrinus ) and its relative, the flat-headed cat ( Prionailurus planiceps ) live in the wetlands and flood plains of Southeast Asia. The fishing cat is about twice as large as a domestic cat. It has partially webbed paws and a thick, layered coat that provides both insulation and water-resistance. The flat-headed cat is about the same size as a domestic cat. Its paws are more flipper-like, and, as the name suggests, it has a flatter head, making it more streamlined in the water. Both cats feed on aquatic animals, although the flat-headed cat’s diet is almost exclusively fish. Unlike most domestic cats, Norwegian forest cats have an affinity for water. ©Thomas Mues / CC BY-SA 2.0 – Original / License Like their wild cousins, domestic cat breeds also have adaptations that give them advantages in the water. Turkish vans, Maine coons, and Norwegian forest cats are known to be fond of water. These breeds have thick, water-resistant coats that provide them with insulation and keep them from getting waterlogged. Bengal cats also love to swim. They have more prominent webbing between their paws that aids their movement in water. Turkish angoras, Egyptian maus, Abyssinians, and Manxes also have an affinity for water. The cat in the video appears to be a Russian blue mix or a British shorthair, both of which have dense double coats that offer some protection from the water. Big cats such as tigers can swim distances of around 5 miles . Although domestic cats are agile, flexible, and have strong limbs, they were not designed to be powerful swimmers. Veterinarians warn that they can generally swim only short distances. Also, cats can swim further in a pool than in a river or lake, where they might have to fight currents. The duration depends on the cat’s age and overall condition. However, if a cat shows signs of stress , such as meowing loudly, rapid breathing, or clawing to escape, remove it from the water immediately. Even cats that dislike being submerged may play in the water in their environment. Experts believe the movement and sound of the water in the sink or shower stimulates their prey drive . Some cats even demand that their owners turn on the faucet for them. Cats often splash in their water bowls or drop their toys in the water. This behavior may be due to curiosity, a desire to test the water’s cleanliness, or simply for amusement. Of course, playing in the water is much different than going for a swim. Behaviorists believe one reason most cats avoid water is that they have not been conditioned to bathing, unlike dogs. Cats may be curious, but they are also typically averse to unfamiliar situations where they are not in control. Some speculate that, because domestic cats are directly descended from wild cats in desert climates, they do not naturally gravitate toward water. Cats also use scent to communicate, so they may be reluctant to wash off their scent. Experts also note that cats have whisker-like hairs on their bodies that provide important sensory information about the environment. Getting their fur and whiskers wet may interfere with the way they perceive their surroundings . Furry mammals also rely on the air in their fur for insulation. Wet fur is not only uncomfortable, but it can also leave cats vulnerable to cold, as their average temperature is between 100.5–102.5 .

    "text": "En el febrero más lluvioso en 27 años, Guayaquil recibió agua equivalente a 89.000 piscinas olímpicas\nLas precipitaciones duplicaron el promedio del mes y se acercaron a niveles del histórico fenómeno de El Niño de 1998. El Comité Erfen mantiene bajo monitoreo un episodio de La Niña Modoki.\nInundaciones en la Avenida Barcelona y José María Velasco Ibarra, oeste de Guayaquil, este miércoles 5 de marzo de 2025.\n- Foto\nPRIMICIAS\nAutor:\nActualizada:\nCompartir:\nGuayaquil vivió en febrero de 2025 un diluvio sin precedentes en casi tres décadas. Las lluvias históricas duplicaron los niveles normales de precipitación mensual y la ciudad registró el febrero más lluvioso de los últimos 27 años.\nSegún el Instituto Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología (Inamhi), la estación meteorológica del aeropuerto, que cuenta con registros históricos desde hace 45 años, terminó el mes con un acumulado de 644,8 milímetros de lluvia (litros por metro cuadrado).\nFebrero de 2025 solo fue superado por los febreros de 1987 (753,3 mm) y 1998 (721,1 mm), ambos marcados por eventos históricos del fenómeno de El Niño.\nEn un mes, las lluvias han cobrado 16 vidas y destruido un centenar de viviendas, puentes y vías en Ecuador\nLa concesionaria de agua potable y alcantarillado Interagua informó este 5 de marzo de 2025 que los sistemas de drenaje pluvial soportaron el mes pasado un acumulado de 222,3 millones de metros cúbicos de lluvia.\nEs decir, en Guayaquil llovió a lo largo del mes el equivalente a 1.601 edificios The Point, el rascacielos más alto de la urbe, de 135 metros de altura, según Interagua. El volumen de agua que cayó sobre la ciudad sería suficiente para llenar casi 89.000 piscinas olímpicas.\n¿Cómo ha respondido el drenaje?\nEl sistema de alcantarillado de aguas lluvias de Guayaquil trabaja al límite y en general ha respondido de mejor forma respecto a etapas lluviosas menos intensas, de acuerdo a la evaluación de la Empresa Pública Municipal para la Gestión de Riesgos y Seguridad (Segura EP).\nInteragua destacó que el denominado plan choque de limpieza de sistemas y canales de drenaje, además de lo invertido en la prevención de El Niño 2024 -que resultó débil-, han contribuido a mitigar los efectos de lluvias históricas.\n\"Ha sido un febrero muy lluvioso. El de 2025 se ubicó como el tercer febrero con más precipitaciones en la historia de Guayaquil, solo detrás de los de 1987 y 1998\".\nCarlos Naranjo, técnico del Inamhi.\nBanEcuador condonará deudas de hasta USD 10.000 a los afectados por el invierno, anuncia el Gobierno\nPero en sectores críticos -zonas bajas y con problemas de diseño del drenaje pluvial- las inundaciones son persistentes y las calles se siguen convirtiendo en ríos o en lagunas de aguas empozadas que tardan horas en bajar de nivel.\nSectores con inundaciones crónicas\nLa avenida Barcelona, al oeste de la ciudad, sufrió inundaciones la mañana de este 5 de marzo y aunque en un sector el agua comenzó a disminuir tras el trabajo de cuadrillas de Interagua, en la intersección con la avenida Velasco Ibarra (bajos del puente de la 17) el problema se extendió toda la mañana.\nLa poza que cubría el nivel de las aceras, y provocó una retención de tránsito vehicular en el lugar, se ubica al borde del Estero Salado, que alcanzó la marea máxima (pleamar) a las 11:15, otro de los condicionantes que limitan la rápida evacuación de las aguas, según las autoridades.\nEn la calle Roberto Costa Prats, de Sauces 6 (al norte), el problema atribuido al diseño del alcantarillado en un sector bajo se ha vuelto crónico. Alrededor de 500 metros de vía y los callejones aledaños soportan inundaciones a diario desde hace tres semanas.\n¿Qué es la Niña Modoki? Así es el fenómeno climático que explica lluvias históricas en la Costa de Ecuador\nBetsy Coveña, de 42 años y vecina de Sauces 6 por décadas, tiene que caminar por una poza de agua estancada y maloliente abajo de la rodilla, para salir de su casa a diario en la manzana 319 de la ciudadela. El el lugar se estudia la instalación de válvulas reguladoras de marea.\n\"Llevamos 15 días con esto. Si no llueve, el nivel baja un poco de tarde o en la noche, pero basta una llovizna para que todo vuelva a subir. Y esto es agua maloliente rebosada de las alcantarillas, no solo lluvia”, indicó Coveña, que atraviesa con su hijo los 100 metros de un callejón inundado.\n¿Cómo será marzo?\nLa configuración del fenómeno de La Niña Modoki estaría intensificando las precipitaciones en Ecuador, unido a factores atmosféricos.\nSe trata de una variante menos conocida de La Niña convencional (o canónica), de la que se esperaban lluvias deficitarias como las de enero y un océano frío, pero que provocó un rápido aumento de la temperatura del mar en las costas de Ecuador desde inicios de febrero.\nEl Comité Nacional para el Estudio Regional del Fenómeno de El Niño (Erfen) confirmó el pasado 19 de febrero que mantiene bajo evaluación un episodio de La Niña Modoki. El término Modoki significa en japonés “lo mismo pero diferente”, como si La Niña “pareciera pero no es”.\nEl pronóstico:\n- El Inamhi tiene activa una alerta meteorológica hasta este viernes 7 de marzo con lluvias de nivel alto y muy alto en buena parte del país. Además, se prevé un mes de marzo de un nivel entre \"normal a lluvioso\", es decir por encima del promedio.\n- El Comité Nacional para el Estudio Regional del Fenómeno de El Niño (Erfen) prevé emitir un pronóstico definitivo en un nuevo boletín oficial, este jueves 6 de marzo de 2025.\n- A nivel global, los pronósticos indican que las condiciones de La Niña, catalogada como débil, persistirán durante el trimestre febrero-marzo-abril, pero podrían comenzar a dar paso a condiciones neutras en el trimestre marzo-abril-mayo. En Ecuador, las perspectivas son que las condiciones neutrales se alcancen también en este trimestre, con una probabilidad superior al 50%.\nCompartir:",

    "text": "Mini rope bridges built to help tiny dormice in UK Forest rangers in the [United Kingdom](https://www.livenowfox.com/tag/world) are helping bridge the gap for [hazel dormice](https://www.livenowfox.com/tag/pets-animals) in the [Forest of Dean. ](https://www.livenowfox.com/tag/science/wild-nature) Tiny 20-meter-long rope bridges were built to help hazel dormice travel safely between woodlands after a section of trees that became infected with Chalara ash dieback had to be cleared, leaving a giant opening. Chalara ash dieback is a fungus, also known as Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, and it blocks a tree’s water support system, causing leaf loss and lesions in the wood, according to Forestry England. FILE - 20-meter rope bridges installed to help dormice. (Forestry England) The fungus causes the crown of the tree to die back, and it will become more brittle over time. If it is left untreated, the tree could potentially collapse. The area of trees that were cleared was part of a larger woodland area where dormice were living, and the animals were in need of a safe way to cross the now treeless swath. FILE - A hazel dormouse. (Forestry England) \"Dormice do not like to come to ground except for hibernation. They feel vulnerable to predators when on the ground and while these bridges do not replace the trees that had to be felled, they will enable dormice to feel safer as they cross from one part of the wood to another,\" said area ecologist at Forestry England, Kate Wollen. The mini-rope bridges are suspended about 16 feet over a forest road and are supported between trees. FILE - Kate Wollen, ecologist for Forestry England. (Forestry England) The bridges took less than two days to install and over the summer, cameras will be fitted to monitor the dormice using them. \"We could not have accomplished this project without the help of our volunteers. Together we have worked very hard in this woodland, improving habitat for the wildlife and flora. We also have a volunteer who has been surveying for dormice here for over 20 years! We hope the bridges will complement this work and that dormice will do well. We’ve never tried this before and it is exciting to see what will happen,\" said community ranger Leoni Dawson.
