    "title": "Maltempo, la minaccia del vento. Smog, oggi nuovo bollino rosso",
    "text": "Una donna bloccata all’interno del traffico, dominato dallo smog\nDopo le giornate quasi primaverili in occasione del Natale e di Capodanno, il maltempo interrompe il trend degli ultimi giorni, con il ponte dell’Epifania che inizia, sicuramente, non nel migliore dei modi. Nel bollettino meteo rilasciato per l’ Emilia-Romagna , è stata, infatti, segnalata l’ allerta arancione per vento molto forte atteso sui rilievi della regione nella giornata odierna. In particolare, nella prima parte del giorno sono previsti venti di burrasca forte (tra 75 e 88 chilometri orari) provenienti da sud-ovest, con rinforzi o raffiche di intensità superiore sulla fascia appenninica emiliana centrale, dunque nelle montagne della provincia reggiana oltre che parmense e modenese. Inoltre, si legge nel bollettino della Protezione civile, sono previste deboli precipitazioni anche a carattere di rovescio sul settore centro-orientale, dove saranno possibili occasionali fenomeni franosi, ruscellamenti lungo i versanti e innalzamenti dei livelli idrometrici nel reticolo minore.\nI fenomeni sono comunque attesi in attenuazione nelle successive quarantotto ore. Se per i paesi del nostro Crinale vale dunque l’allerta meteo, lo smog invece la fa da padrone in provincia dove scattano da oggi le restrizioni da bollino rosso in tutte le province occidentali della regione, da Piacenza a Modena, includendo quindi anche la nostra città. Dunque, tutta l’Emilia, viene coinvolta dalle misure emergenziali previste dal Piano regionale per la qualità dell’aria che entrano in vigore da questa mattina; per il territorio modenese, in particolare, l’allerta smog prosegue dal 27 dicembre scorso.\nPer la provincia di Ferrara, invece, che era sottoposta alle misure emergenziali come Modena fino a oggi, da domani torna il bollino verde e quindi termina l’allerta. In base a quanto previsto dal piano, i blocchi del traffico vengono estesi anche ai mezzi con motore diesel Euro 5, che si fermano dalle 8.30 alle 18.30 insieme ai veicoli più inquinanti già oggetto delle misure ordinarie. E cioè i diesel fino a Euro 4, i veicoli a benzina fino agli Euro 2, quelli a gpl-benzina e metano-benzina fino agli Euro 1, ciclomotori e motocicli fino agli Euro 1. In vigore anche il divieto di utilizzare stufe domestiche a biomassa (con certificazione inferiore a 4 stelle) e il divieto di spandimento liquami. Scatta inoltre l’obbligo di mantenere una temperatura massima di 19 gradi in case e luoghi di lavoro.\nCesare Corbelli\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "title": "Inside The Secret And Violent World Of The Late Glock Gun Inventor, Gaston Glock",
    "text": "Austrian entrepreneur and onetime billionaire Gaston Glock died on December 27 at age 94. This 2003 Forbes magazine story on Glock sheds light on how chance played a role in his creation of what became an immensely popular handgun.\nGaston Glock, the man behind the popular Glock handgun, died yesterday at age 94. In 2003, Forbes scored a rare interview with the entrepreneur. From 2019 to 2021, Forbes included Gaston Glock on our annual list of the World’s Billionaires with a fortune estimated at $1.1 billion. Counsel for Glock strongly objected to his inclusion in the billionaire ranks and disputed Forbes’ valuation, which was based on estimated revenue of $500 million for the gunmaker at the time.\nHere is the March 31, 2003 Forbes magazine article about Gaston Glock, republished in full:\nBy Dyan Machan\nHe is the man behind the gun. You don't mess with Gaston Glock.\nHis most trusted associate allegedly tried. Lured into a dimly lit garage in Luxembourg by his colleague Charles Ewert, the Austrian Glock stopped to look at a sports car at Ewert's suggestion. Suddenly, a massive masked man leaped from behind and smashed a rubber mallet into Glock's skull. Ewert fled to the stairwell. \"I am a coward,\" he later told Forbes. With Glock off balance, the attacker landed another crushing blow. \"I was fighting for my life,\" recalls Glock, 73, during a rare interview with the press.\nSpringing up on legs toned by miles of daily swimming, Glock thrust his enormous fist into his assailant's eye socket. As the would-be assassin staggered, Glock pounded again, knocking out a few of the man's teeth. The bloodied attacker staggered, then collapsed on top of Glock \"with his arms outstretched like Jesus Christ,\" according to John Paul Frising, Luxembourg's deputy attorney general, who brought attempted murder charges against the attacker, the French-born Jacques (Spartacus) Pecheur, 67. This was how the police found the two men at 9:30 a.m. on July 27, 1999.\nGlock says he lost a quart of blood from cuts and abrasions and that he suffered seven head wounds. Yet as soon as he reached the hospital he summoned his personal bankers at UBS and Banque Ferrier Lullin. The banks held $70 million in cash, and Ewert had access to it all. By 12:30 p.m. Glock managed to move $40 million to a Swiss account. But by then Ewert had blocked the other $30 million with a court order. As he nursed his injuries, Glock wondered how he could have trusted the wrong man.\nLast November Ewert was arrested and thrown into a Luxembourg jail, awaiting a Mar. 12 verdict following a three-week nonjury trial for attempted murder. If found guilty, Ewert could face up to 30 years in jail. He maintains his innocence, claiming he was framed—either by one of Glock's lawyers or family members or by the Austrian government—in order to be cheated out of his share of the company.\nTo appreciate the magnitude of this apparent betrayal, consider that the relationship between the two men had been a factor in the success of Glock GmbH. Ewert, a business consultant who once worked for the Luxembourg stock exchange, worked with Glock for 15 years as Glock's little-known gun became the sidearm of choice for U.S. law enforcement.\nThe U.S. police business was once dominated by Smith & Wesson and Beretta. Then in 1985 along came Glock with a gun made from a nylon resin that was tough enough to be made into most parts of a pistol (except the carbon steel barrel). The Glock was also revolutionary for its simple design—34 parts, compared with 60 or so for the Smith & Wesson .45 caliber semiautomatic—and its 24-ounce weight, to 25.4 ounces for the Smith & Wesson. A Glock shooter experiences a softer recoil because the gun's polymer frame flexes slightly when it's fired. Glock fans include the New York City police, U.S. Special Forces, the FBI and many international antiterrorist units.\nThese days Glock GmbH has an estimated $100 million in sales, two-thirds of it from the trigger-happy United States. A gun that retails for $500 can be manufactured for $75, and the company has a pretax margin nearing 60%, estimates John Farnam of Defense Training International, a LaPorte, Colo. small arms instructor.\nSuccess has not made Glock, a highly secretive and taciturn man, any more trusting of the people around him. He has a few very high-profile friends. Among them: Pope John Paul II and Jorg Haider, former leader of Austria's ultraright Freedom Party and a Hitler admirer. At his lakefront mansion in Velden, Austria, Glock's favorite room is in the basement, where he can control the smallest detail of his home's inner workings, including the temperature of the tiles in his upstairs bathroom. He flies his own Cessna Citation jet wherever he travels. \"There are fewer crazy people in the air,\" he says.\nFrom his headquarters in Deutsch-Wagram, near Vienna, Glock has run through seven U.S. sales managers in 11 years. Last month his top lieutenant in the U.S., Paul Jannuzzo, a tightly wound former New Jersey prosecutor and 12-year veteran of the company, resigned as general counsel and chief operating officer.\n\"Jannuzzo went crazy,\" says Glock, without further explanation. (A source close to the company says Jannuzzo was frustrated and had tried to quit before.) Jannuzzo, 46, and Glock clashed and agreed to part ways after the annual Shot Show gun convention in Orlando, Fla. last month. Glock had hoped to retain Jannuzzo as his general counsel while assigning the operational duties to another employee. Jannuzzo will remain Glock's outside counsel and declines to comment on the situation, though he earlier told FORBES, \"Mr. Glock does not shy away from a fight.\"\nHe should know. Jannuzzo spearheaded Glock's efforts to kill the Clinton Administration's voluntary gun-control effort in 2000—it was that or face a multitude of tobacco-like government-sponsored lawsuits. \"Extortionist,\" is how Glock refers to the measures that would have introduced an oversight committee, as well as restrict how guns are sold. (The company's obstinacy resulted in 28 liability suits filed by municipalities claiming that Glock is responsible for murders committed with its weapons; 11 suits remain.) Jannuzzo also led a successful patent infringement suit against Smith & Wesson, which created a gun that looked a lot like a Glock—\"I felt like my wallet was stolen,\" Glock hisses—and resulted in an undisclosed multimillion-dollar settlement. And Jannuzzo acted as pit bull in notifying 12 record labels that the company objects to artists using the word \"Glock\" in rap songs such as Dr. Dre's \"Bitches Ain't Shit,\" mainly out of fear that Glock's name will become a generic term for handgun.\nGlock is now more than ever a one-man show. His two sons, Robert and Gaston Jr., and his daughter, Brigitte, have company jobs but limited authority. When asked what her role is, Brigitte cracks in German, \"Being my father's personal slave.\" Who has input into product development? Showing rare humor, Glock smiles: \"You might call it 'a very small committee.'\"\nAnd so it has been since the beginning. Back in 1981 Glock was producing plastic grenade shells for the Austrian army, in addition to plastic curtain-rod rings. One day he overheard two colonels complain that no gun existed that could meet their specifications. When Glock offered to make one, they laughed at him.\n\"You do not laugh at Mr. Glock,\" says Christopher Edwards, the burly former deputy sheriff of Jefferson County, Ky., who now runs Glock's training program in Smyrna, Ga. \"He takes that personally.\"\nGlock never doubted he could make a superior gun. \"That I knew nothing was my advantage,\" he says. He worked on his weapon nightly in his basement. He test-fired it with his left hand so if it blew up, he could still draw a blueprint with his right. \"I learned to stay out of his way,\" smiles his wife, Helga. The firearm surpassed all competition, and he received the army's order for 25,000 guns in 1983.\nBut Glock was eager to grow. Two years later he traveled to Luxembourg, a country where holding companies are not subject to income or capital gains taxation. During a chance encounter on a street in the city of Luxembourg, Glock asked a businessman if he knew someone who could help him expand his fledgling enterprise. \"I am your man,\" said Charles Ewert, who claimed he had international connections.\nHe also had a reputation that Glock had not been aware of. Ewert had a habit of forming offshore companies to hold business interests for people who requested that sort of thing, earning him the sobriquet \"Panama Charly.\" The two agreed that Glock would employ Unipatent, a shell company Ewert owned, to hold the shares of subsidiaries Glock set up to sell his guns. Unipatent, it turns out, had a dubious history. Ewert had bought the shell, which was once owned by Hakki Yaman Namli, a Turkish financier. Namli controlled the First Merchants Bank in Cyprus, and was convicted, along with the bank, of laundering $450 million in 2000. (The conviction was overturned a year later.) During the trial Namli insisted the bank was owned by Ewert.\nWhatever his connections, Ewert became a public face of Glock outside Austria. Glock himself concentrated on manufacturing. In 1985 the company opened a U.S. subsidiary in Smyrna to promote sales to policemen. Good move. With the rise of drug-related crime, cops did not want to be outgunned by criminals and were trading in their six-shot revolvers for semiautomatic pistols. The Glock 17 held 18 rounds and, because it was cheap to make, few competitors could beat it on price. Its relatively few parts also made it simple to service.\nEwert opened offices in Hong Kong, France, Switzerland and Uruguay. Glock was pleased and told his family and executives that if anything ever happened to him, they should go to Ewert. \"I was considered the eldest son,\" says Ewert, now 49.\nAll that changed in the spring of 1999. Glock received a call from a Geneva employee Ewert had fired. He claimed that Ewert had siphoned off corporate funds to buy a house in Switzerland, and hinted at other misdeeds. Glock brushed off the allegations as sour grapes. But to put his mind at rest, he asked Ewert for a meeting. That's when he got the rubber hammer in the head.\nAfter his recovery from the attack, Glock says he discovered that Ewert had created dozens of offshore companies that appeared affiliated with the gunmaker, all with slightly different names and addresses. As much as $100 million, Glock's lawyers allege, had been stolen and shifted into companies Ewert controlled. Beginning in 1989, says Deputy AG Frising, Ewert was progressively taking control of Unipatent and its chief asset, U.S.-based Glock Inc. Glock's lawyers allege that Ewert awarded himself new shares in Unipatent in return for $600,000. Ewert maintains through his attorney that he did nothing without Glock's consent.\nBoth Ewert and Glock claim ownership of Unipatent. Each accuses the other of owning a phony set of unregistered bearer shares. \"Glock says I have less than 5% of Unipatent? Glock is a nut!\" says Ewert. A Luxembourg court will settle the dispute.\nEwert is unlikely to be much of a further irritant. Even if he is not convicted of attempted murder, he may face additional charges in Luxembourg for forgery, embezzlement and fraud, according to Frising, whose investigation is still pending. Failing that, he could be extradited to the U.S. Last November he was indicted on three federal counts of wire fraud in Georgia.\nGlock looks forward to getting back to business—making guns and fighting what Jannuzzo calls \"dumb-ass lawsuits.\" He's also aiming at new markets. \"Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, South Africa and Hungary all have forces carrying 40-year-old guns,\" says Glock's marketing director, Herbert Weikinger. But before he can elaborate, Glock sends him out of the room for talking out of turn.\n\"The attack was the best thing that happened to me,\" says Glock in his heavily accented English. \"Otherwise, I would have gone on trusting Ewert.\"\nKerry A.

    "text": "Queenslandhas sweltered through its hottest December day in four years but residents are warned of another round of destructive storms this weekend.\nThe hot weather impacted much of northern Australia, with temperatures climbing into the mid-to-high 40s in some areas, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.\nBrisbane reached 38.3 degrees marking the hottest December day since 2019.\nIt comes as eastern states embark on a clean-up mission following severe weather and brace for potentially more dangerous, stormy conditions.\nFurther severe weather has been forecast for parts of eastern Australia for the final weekend of 2023, with severe thunderstorms expected to redevelop across eastern Queensland and northeast New South Wales from Saturday into the New Year.\nThere is a risk of severe thunderstorms across Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions in New South Wales, and across south-east and central Queensland.\nWhile the conditions from storms earlier this week have eased, BOM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms would develop from Queensland all the way to Victoria and South Australia.\n\"There are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday,\" Scully said.\n\"Everyone is encouraged to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings.\"\nAs severe thunderstorms develop across the east, heatwaves are also expected across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.\nParts of Western Australia are forecast to reach 49 degrees on Saturday and in the Northern Territory, low to severe-intensity heatwave conditions will cover most areas.\nExtreme heatwave conditions have been forecast for parts of northern Queensland, while low to locally severe heatwave conditions are building around Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and Cairns.\nMeanwhile, the Gold Coast's Movie World has reopened after the Christmas Day storm caused trees to fall around rides and rollercoasters.\nVillage Roadshow's chief operating officer Bikash Randhawa said he had not seen a storm like it in 30 years.\n\"It came from nowhere ... It hit us pretty hard,\" Randhawa said.\n\"We would not open if things were not safe.\n\"That's the reason why Paradise Country (a section of the park) is still closed.\n\"It will be closed until we assess the damage and it is deemed safe for people to come in.\"\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has been criticised for not putting out more warnings before the storm.\nEnergex aims to have 90 per cent of households reconnected to power by December 31.\nResidents in Mount Tambourine and Jimboomba will need their systems rebuilt so will have a much longer wait for electricity.\nThe storm was described as an \"unprecedented disaster\" by the state's police commissioner yesterday.\nFinancial assistance of $180 per person and $900 for families has been made available by the state government.\nSix people have died from the storms in the state over the festive period.",

    "text": "Days ahead of his scheduled imprisonment, Steve Bannon declares the country is in a “political war” Bannon: “If you continue to fight for your republic, we will be victorious” Written by Media Matters Staff Published 06/27/24 5:54 PM EDT Video file Citation From the June 27, 2024, edition of Real America's Voice's War Room STEVE BANNON (HOST): We are the rule of law party, but it's about the rule of law under the Constitution. What you've had is something that's shredded the Constitution, and you, quite frankly, are part of a Republican Party that allowed the radical Democrats to do it. You were collaborators. You just got tapped along. You were what we call the controlled opposition. We’re not the controlled opposition. Hey, guess what, there may be prison, there's already been prison time for Peter Navarro, other people have been put in prison. Some for many years. They just had a 75-year-old grandmother that was put to prison. People are going to go to prison, they've already bankrupted people. They bankrupted-- they're liquidating Alex Jones. They're trying to bankrupt Jim Hoft. They're now going to go after Epoch Times. This is just-- it's a political war. These kind of things are going to happen, but we are ascendent and if we don't quit, we win. We can only lose if we say we've had enough and we can't do it anymore, it's theirs. It's their country. If you continue to fight for your republic, we will be victorious.",

    "text": "‘It’s really challenging’: Egg prices impacting Madison bakery\nMADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - The ongoing nationwide egg shortage because of the bird flu outbreak has led to higher egg prices, leaving grocery stores and consumers scrambled. But for local bakeries, they’re either having to find alternatives or deal with the current cost of eggs.\nAt The Baked Lab in Madison, owner Shawn Bolduc is navigating the current price of eggs as a small business owner.\n“Pretty much every product that we make has some type of egg content in it,” he said.\nAs a from-scratch bakery, Bolduc says it’s been challenging recently.\n“Over the past couple of years, our carton of eggs has gone from $23 ish to this week is was $101,” he said.\nBolduc says The Baked Lab’s biggest seller is wedding cakes. With wedding season starting in just a few months, he says they go through 30 to 45 dozen eggs a week.\n“We use eggs in all of our cake bases. We use egg whites in all of our buttercream. We use our eggs in our brownies, in our cookies, our cookie sandwiches,” he said. “We don’t substitute eggs and it’s really challenging to substitute eggs when you think of baking as a science.”\nBut at Greenbush Bakery in Madison, they’ve never used raw eggs in their baked items.\n“It doesn’t really affect us a whole lot,” owner Taylor Carlson said. “We don’t use raw eggs at all but it’s a dry egg that’s in our donut mixes.”\nCarlson says it’s been a relief for his family’s business because they’ve seen the cost of other essentials go up.\n“A lot of the stuff like sugar and flour it’s all across the board everything went up super high,” Carlson said.\nBut ahead of wedding season for Bolduc, they’re putting all of their eggs in one basket.\n“Hopefully we’ll have some new chickens by the summertime that are healthy enough to provide us some respite from the current prices,” Bolduc said.\nThe Baked Lab says it will continue to monitor egg prices before they raise the cost of products for their customers.\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2025 WMTV.

    "text": "CORONAVÍRUS\nBoletim da Fiocruz indica alta de casos de covid-19 no país\nDoença atinge especialmente pacientes idosos\nPor:\n[Agência Brasil](mailto:pauta@ebc.com.br)Publicado em: 19/12/2024 21:16\nFoto: Bertrand Guay/AFP |\nA nova edição do boletim semanal Infogripe, divulgado nesta quinta-feira (19) pela Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), revela uma tendência alta de casos de Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave (SRAG) associadas ao covid-19 em alguns estados do país. É o caso do Ceará, onde um cenário de crescimento dessas ocorrências já havia sido indicado na edição anterior da publicação.\nHá indícios de que Minas Gerais, Sergipe e Rondônia também iniciam um movimento parecido. O mesmo ocorre no Distrito Federal. Os casos envolvem especialmente pacientes idosos, que são mais suscetíveis aos efeitos mais adversos da infecção pelo coronavírus causador da covid-19.\nO boletim registra aumento de ocorrências de SRAG entre crianças e adolescentes de até 14 anos, associados principalmente ao rinovírus, em quatro unidades federativas: Acre, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais e Sergipe. Os dados do novo boletim são referentes à semana epidemiológica que vai de 8 a 14 de dezembro.\nA SRAG é uma complicação respiratória que demanda hospitalização e está associada muitas vezes ao agravamento de alguma infecção viral. O paciente pode apresentar desconforto respiratório e queda no nível de saturação de oxigênio, entre outros sintomas.\nDe acordo com a nova edição, considerando as últimas quatro semanas epidemiológicas analisadas, a covid-19 esteve relacionada a 31,1% dos casos de SRAG com resultado positivo para alguma infecção viral. Já o rinovírus representou 38,6%. Além disso, 7,9% estiveram associados ao vírus sincicial respiratório (VSR), 7,6% à influenza A e 7,3% à influenza B.\nQuando se observa apenas os quadros de SRAG que resultaram em mortes nessas quatro semanas, 63,6% estão associados à covid-19. A maioria desses casos que tiveram a morte como desfecho envolveram idosos.\nAo todo, o Brasil já registrou em 2024 um total de 78.739 casos de SRAG com resultado laboratorial positivo para algum vírus respiratório. Destes, 16,8% são referentes à influenza A; 2% à influenza B; 19,6% à covid-19; 27,1% ao rinovírus e 33,8% ao VSR. Outras 8.280 ocorrências estão em fase de análise.\nO boletim Infogripe sinaliza para uma tendência de aumento de SRAG em nível nacional. Em 11 unidades federativas, há sinal de crescimento dos casos no longo prazo: Acre, Amazonas, Ceará, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Rondônia, Santa Catarina e Sergipe. Além disso, há tendência de aumento das ocorrência no curto prazo no Acre, Amazonas, Bahia, Ceará, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Norte e Rio Grande do Sul.\nCenário em 2024\nFazendo um balanço do cenário epidemiológico de 2024, a pesquisadora da Fiocruz, Tatiana Portella, destacou que o país viveu duas ondas importantes de covid-19. A primeira, que começou ainda no final de 2023 e avançou pelo início deste ano, afetou diversos estados. Já a segunda onda, iniciada em agosto de 2024, teve São Paulo como o estado mais atingido.\nApesar dessas duas ondas, a pesquisadora destaca que, em comparação com 2023, houve uma redução de aproximadamente 40% nos casos de SRAG associados à covid-19. Ainda assim, Portella alerta para o crescimento dessas ocorrências no encerramento de 2024.\n“Neste fim de ano, observamos uma menor atividade dos vírus respiratórios, com exceção apenas da covid-19, que já começa a apresentar sinais de aumento em algumas regiões do país. Para as festas de fim de ano, recomendamos o uso de máscaras caso surjam sintomas de gripe ou resfriado. Também sugerimos, sempre que possível, priorizar ambientes mais arejados, especialmente neste momento de início de aumento do número de casos de covid-19”.\nMais Notícias\nMais lidas\nÚLTIMAS",
