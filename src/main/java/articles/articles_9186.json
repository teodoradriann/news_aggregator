We have created a comprehensive buyer's guide to help you understand and choose the best low profile RAM for your needs. Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of memory modules! Why Choose Low Profile RAM? - Ideal for compact builds: Low profile RAM modules are designed to fit in smaller systems, making them perfect for compact builds where space is limited. - Enhanced compatibility: These memory modules are specifically developed to work efficiently in systems with limited clearance, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of motherboards and [CPU](https://robots.net/tech/where-is-cpu/)coolers. - Cooling benefits: With a reduced height, low profile RAM allows for better airflow within your system, resulting in improved thermal performance and overall stability. - Aesthetic appeal: The sleek and minimalistic design of low profile RAM can add a touch of style to your build, especially if you have a transparent case that showcases your components. Factors to Consider When selecting the right low profile RAM for your system, keep the following factors in mind: 1. Memory Type - DDR3, DDR4, or DDR5: Depending on your motherboard's compatibility, choose the memory type that suits your requirements best. DDR4 is the most common and widely supported option currently available. 2. Memory Capacity - Determine the amount of memory you need based on your usage requirements. If you're an average user, 8GB to 16GB should suffice. However, if you're a power user, content creator, or gamer, consider opting for 32GB or even 64GB of RAM for optimal performance. 3. Memory Speed and Latency - Higher clock speeds (measured in MHz) result in faster data transfer rates, which can lead to improved system responsiveness. Likewise, lower latency (measured in CL or CAS latency) indicates faster data access. Strike a balance between the two based on your specific usage needs and budget constraints. 4. Motherboard Compatibility - Ensure that the low profile RAM you choose is compatible with your [motherboard](https://robots.net/tech/what-is-the-motherboard/), both in terms of physical fit and supported memory modules. Consult your motherboard's manual or the manufacturer's website for detailed compatibility information. 5. CPU Cooler Clearance - Verify the maximum clearance space available for RAM modules within your CPU cooler's design. This is crucial as oversized or taller RAM modules may not fit beneath the cooler, resulting in compatibility issues. 6. Brand Reputation and Warranty - Consider purchasing low profile RAM from reputable brands known for their quality components and excellent customer support. Additionally, check whether the product comes with a warranty, as it provides peace of mind in case of any issues. 7. Price and Value - Set a budget for your RAM purchase and compare prices across different brands and retailers. Remember to take into account factors such as capacity, speed, and latency to assess the value offered by each product. Frequently Asked Questions about 10 Amazing Low Profile RAM For 2023 No, low profile RAM modules offer similar performance as their standard height counterparts. The main difference lies in their physical dimensions. Yes, low profile RAM can be overclocked just like any other [RAM module](https://robots.net/tech/what-does-a-ram-module-look-like/). However, heat dissipation may be slightly more challenging due to the compact design, so [monitor](https://robots.net/tech/what-is-a-monitor/) temperatures carefully. While low profile RAM is commonly used in desktop computers, it is generally not suitable for laptops as they require specialized memory modules designed specifically for mobile devices. No, not all low profile RAM modules feature RGB lighting. Be sure to check the product specifications if RGB lighting is a requirement for your build. In most cases, RAM is installed horizontally into the motherboard’s DIMM slots. Installing low profile RAM vertically is not recommended, as it may lead to compatibility issues and reduce airflow within the system.",

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Norwich Evening News",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. Under a banner that read “Bethlehem’s Christmas bells ring for a cease-fire in Gaza,” a few teenagers offered small inflatable Santa figures, but no one was buying. Instead of their traditional musical march through the streets of Bethlehem, young scouts stood silently with flags. A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence. Bethlehem’s mayor, Hana Haniyeh, said in an address: “Our message every year on Christmas is one of peace and love, but this year it’s a message of sadness, grief and anger in front of the international community with what is happening and going on in the Gaza Strip.” Dr Joseph Mugasa, a paediatrician, was one of the few international visitors. He said his tour group of 15 people from Tanzania was “determined” to come to the region despite the situation. “I’ve been here several times, and it’s quite a unique Christmas, as usually there’s a lot of people and a lot of celebrations,” he said. “But you can’t celebrate while people are suffering, so we are sad for them and praying for peace.” More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.",

    "text": "Africa-Press – Cameroun. L’évêque de Yagoua, Mgr Barthélemy Yaouda, s’est une nouvelle fois exprimé avec véhémence sur la situation sociopolitique du Cameroun, fustigeant la mauvaise gouvernance et la marginalisation des enfants originaires de l’Extrême-Nord. Le 1er janvier 2025, lors d’une homélie marquée par une prise de parole directe et sans concession, l’homme de Dieu a réitéré son appel à un changement à la tête de l’État, soulignant l’urgence d’une alternance.\n« Nous avons déjà trop souffert. Le pire ne viendra pas. Même si le Diable devait prendre le pouvoir, qu’il le fasse d’abord, et on verra après », avait-il lancé.\nCette déclaration, perçue comme un cri de désespoir face aux souffrances vécues par une partie de la population, a suscité une polémique nationale. Face à la controverse, une nouvelle vidéo circulant sur les réseaux sociaux montre Mgr Yaouda tentant de clarifier ses propos.\n« Je n’invoque pas le diable. Tout prêtre chasse le diable. Avec la prière, avec l’eau bénite, on chasse le diable », a-t-il expliqué, précisant que sa métaphore visait à dénoncer l’incapacité des gouvernants à répondre aux besoins urgents du peuple, et non à appeler au chaos.\nDans cette même vidéo, Mgr Yaouda a particulièrement pointé du doigt la situation des jeunes originaires de l’Extrême-Nord, une région historiquement marginalisée, selon lui. « Où est l’amour ? Où sont les écoles dans les campagnes ? Nos enfants souffrent, ils sont limités alors que les enfants des autres sont en Amérique, au Canada, en Europe… » a-t-il déploré, faisant écho aux préoccupations de nombreux jeunes diplômés de la région qui, faute d’opportunités, se retrouvent bloqués à Douala ou Yaoundé, contraints d’occuper des emplois précaires comme gardiens de nuit ou conducteurs de moto-taxis.\nL’évêque a également critiqué l’utilisation des populations du Nord comme simple « bétail électoral », manipulées et sollicitées uniquement pendant les campagnes électorales sans réelle considération pour leurs conditions de vie après les élections. « On nous demande nos voix, mais actuellement, dans ce bétail électoral du Nord, il y a des panthères, des loups… », a-t-il ironisé.\nPour plus d’informations et d’analyses sur la Cameroun, suivez Africa-Press",

    "text": "Religion L’expulsion d’un imam de Toulouse confirmée par le Conseil d’État L’imam de la Grande mosquée de Toulouse avait été condamné des propos haineux envers les juifs lors d’un prêche. Le Conseil d’État a confirmé jeudi l’expulsion d’un imam de Toulouse prononcée en avril pour des propos haineux envers les juifs, selon une décision consultée par l’AFP. Le Conseil est allé dans le sens de la justice administrative, qui avait rejeté le recours en urgence déposé par Mohamed Tataïat. Cet imam de la Grande mosquée de Toulouse avait été condamné en 2022 à quatre mois d’emprisonnement avec sursis pour avoir tenu lesdits propos lors d’un prêche. Mohamed Tataïat avait été arrêté à son domicile le 19 avril, sur autorisation du juge des libertés et de la détention, [puis expulsé](/faits-divers-justice/2024/04/20/expulsion-vers-l-algerie-d-un-imam-condamne-pour-provocation-a-la-haine). Ses avocats avaient alors déposé un recours devant le juge des référés, dénonçant une expulsion expéditive et ne tenant pas compte de son comportement exemplaire depuis le prêche décrié, prononcé en 2017. Ce recours a toutefois été rejeté par le tribunal administratif de Paris, décision confirmée jeudi par le Conseil d’État. Vers un nouveau recours Arrivé en France en 1985, Mohamed Tataïat avait rejoint Toulouse deux ans plus tard pour exercer à la mosquée du quartier Empalot. Le ministre de l’Intérieur [Gérald Darmanin](/p/gerald-darmanin), qui avait signé l’arrêté d’expulsion, a pris note de la décision du Conseil d’État sur X (ex-Twitter), en se félicitant de la « fermeté » et de l’« efficacité de la loi immigration ». Vincent Brengarth, l’avocat de Mohamed Tataïat, a annoncé son intention de déposer un nouveau recours, sur le fond cette fois, et assuré que son client avait « poursuivi sans le moindre incident ses prêches depuis 2017 » et « qu’aucune menace à l’ordre public n’(avait) été démontrée par l’administration ». Dans son ordonnance fin avril, le tribunal estimait que les propos de Mohamed Tataïat « constituent une provocation explicite et délibérée à la discrimination, à la haine et à la violence contre un groupe de personnes - en l’espèce, les Juifs -, et revêtent une résonance et une gravité particulière depuis l’attaque du 7 octobre 2023 menée par le Hamas à l’encontre d’Israël ».",

    "text": "STAKEHOLDERS are jubilant over the government keeping Taman Rimba Kiara green.\nSeveral non-government organisations said the decision on the park in Taman Tun Dr Ismail, Kuala Lumpur, demonstrated the government’s commitment to protecting green spaces.\nSave Taman Rimba Kiara Working Group, Persatuan Penduduk Rumah Panjang Bukit Kiara and Friends of Bukit Kiara were reacting to Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh’s comments during a press conference on July 17.\nShe said the government would direct Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to keep the park as a green space while also providing permanent housing for 98 families at a long house.\nYeoh said DBKL would be directed to ensure this was reflected in Kuala Lumpur Local Plan 2040 (KLLP2040).\nShe added that housing for the longhouse community should be built on the current 1.62ha footprint without encroaching into Taman Rimba Kiara.\nThe residents groups lauded the government’s effort to honour the Federal Court’s ruling on April 18 last year, which quashed a development order by DBKL for Taman Rimba Kiara.\nJustice Datuk Nallini Pathmanathan had said in her judgment that according to Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 (KLSP2020), the land alienated for development was demarcated as a green area for public use.\n“It seems that the demarcation was changed without a corresponding rectification in the structure plan,” she said, adding that no hearings were held to gather public input about the change in land status.\nIn 2016, it was reported that a development comprising eight blocks of serviced apartments and one block of affordable housing was planned for the area.\nLegal battles then ensued involving residents, DBKL, Yayasan Wilayah Persekutuan (YWP) and the developer, while a series of negotiations to find a compromise failed.\nIn 2017, residents filed a judicial review against DBKL and the mayor, seeking to quash the development order.\nThe High Court denied this request, concluding that no elements of illegality were found in the order’s issuance.\nIn 2018, residents filed an appeal to challenge the High Court decision, and it was overturned by the Court of Appeal in 2021.\nDBKL, YWP and the developer then filed an appeal with the Federal Court to reinstate the development order.\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",

    "text": "Leer todo el artículo EFE Latam Biden descarta indultar a su hijo Hunter si es condenado por la compra ilegal de un arma Agencia EFE 7 de junio de 2024, 12:28 a. m. · 2 min de lectura Enlace copiado\nWashington, 6 jun (EFE).- El presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden, descartó este viernes indultar a su hijo Hunter en caso de que este llegue a ser condenado en el juicio iniciado esta semana por compra y posesión ilegal de un arma en 2018.\nEn una entrevista concedida a ABC News afirmó con un escueto \"sí\" que respetará el veredicto.\nEs la primera vez en la historia de Estados Unidos que el hijo de un mandatario en activo se enfrenta a un juicio que, en este caso, puede afectar a la campaña de Joe Biden en las presidenciales del 5 de noviembre ya que los republicanos, especialmente el expresidente Donald Trump (2017-2021), lo utilizan con frecuencia como arma arrojadiza en su contra.\nHunter Biden es hijo de la primera esposa del presidente, la fallecida Neilia Biden, y está acusado de mentir en octubre de 2018 cuando no reconoció que consumía drogas en un formulario para comprar un revólver Colt Cobra de calibre 38, que luego guardó durante 11 días.\nEl proceso comenzó el lunes en Wilmington (Delaware) y después de que este miércoles declararan su exesposa, Kathleen Buhle, y una exnovia, Zoe Kestan, este jueves se sentó en el banquillo Hallie Biden, viuda de su hermano Beau Biden, fallecido de cáncer en 2015, y con quien Hunter tuvo una relación extramarital tras el fallecimiento de Beau.\nHallie Biden dijo haberse asustado cuando encontró la pistola en el coche de Hunter y admitió haber empezado a consumir crack de cocaína después de que este la introdujera a esa droga: \"Fue una experiencia terrible de la que me avergüenzo. Lamento ese periodo de mi vida\", señaló.\nNo obstante, señaló no haberle visto consumir drogas en la época en la que compró y tuvo el arma en cuestión.\nJoe Biden no ha acudido a la corte, pero el lunes, cuando se seleccionó el jurado, sí estuvo presente la primera dama, Jill Biden, que justo ese día cumplió 73 años.\nEn un comunicado, no obstante, el mandatario demócrata apuntó que como presidente no iba a hacer ningún comentario sobre casos federales pendientes, pero que como padre tenía un \"amor ilimitado\" por su hijo, \"confianza en él y respeto por su fuerza\".\nLos tres cargos que se le imputan a Hunter Biden por la compra y posesión ilegal de un arma al haber mentido sobre su adicción conllevan una pena máxima de 25 años de cárcel, si bien las sentencias suelen ser menores para quienes, como él, carecen de antecedentes penales.\n(c) Agencia EFE",
