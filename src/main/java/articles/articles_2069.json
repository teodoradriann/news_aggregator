    "title": "Rivoluzione per il car-sharing. Nuove licenze e scooter elettrici. Idea limite automatico di 30 all’ora",
    "text": "La delibera del Comune: stop al tetto massimo per gli operatori e spazio a mezzi ibridi e di ultima generazione. Larghetti (Coalizione Civica) spinge su auto già impostate per il rispetto della velocità. Opposizioni scettiche.\nÈ rivoluzione per il car-sharing sotto le Torri. La svolta l’ha annunciata direttamente Valentina Orioli, assessore comunale alla Mobilità, dopo l’approvazione di una delibera ad hoc: stop al numero limitato di operatori e all’esclusività del sistema, con nuove licenze di durata triennale (2025-2027), e spazio soprattutto agli scooter elettrici. E potrebbe anche spuntare un nuovo limite, automatico, per i tratti a 30 chilometri orari. L’obiettivo, ribadiscono da Palazzo d’Accursio, \"è consolidare un servizio\" che negli ultimi anni \"ha avuto le sue difficoltà\", a partire dal blocco imposto dalla pandemia, ma non solo.\n\"Non stiamo facendo una gara, ma un bando rispetto al quale gli operatori che dimostreranno di avere tutti i requisiti richiesti possono portare il servizio in città – puntualizza Orioli –. Non si tratta di requisiti così facili da soddisfare: sono numeri importanti, con una flotta minima che conti subito 50 veicoli, poi 100 entro il terzo mese e 200 a regime\".\nNon più solo Enjoy e Corrente dunque, i due attori in campo fino a oggi, i cui contratti scadono a dicembre: la delibera che determina il ‘car sharing a flusso libero’ relega a Srm la procedura di affidamento del servizio, in collaborazione con il Comune, stabilendo le linee guida per il bando. Tra i requisiti spicca anche la presenza nelle flotta di ciascun operatore di almeno il 60% di auto elettriche o ibride. Il periodo di affidamento sarà di tre anni dalla sottoscrizione del contratto, con eventualità di rinnovo per altri due anni se l’operatore si vincolasse per l’intera durata residua alla gestione di una flotta interamente elettrica. E ancora nuovi parcheggi e stalli e l’arrivo degli scooter elettrici: ogni operatore potrà inserirne un numero massimo pari a quello delle auto.\nLa novità che sta già facendo parlare di sé, però, è soprattutto quella che lega il car-sharing alla Città 30, con l’ipotesi di prevedere auto impostate per rispettare in automatico il limite di 30 all’ora. L’idea è di Simona Larghetti, consigliera comunale di Coalizione Civica, con un’apertura al riguardo da parte di Orioli. Larghetti si rifà al sistema ‘Isa’, acronimo per ‘Intelligent speed assistance’, che secondo lei l’Ue imporrà obbligatoriamente \"per le auto prodotte dopo il 2025\". \"Un esperimento interessante\", lo definisce l’assessore, che ribadisce la volontà di considerare l’idea e discuterne in Commissione.\nUna rivoluzione che al momento, però, non sembra raccogliere il favore dell’opposizione. Le consigliere Manuela Zuntini (FdI) e Samuela Quercioli (Bologna ci piace) avanzano perplessità sulla rimozione del tetto massimo di operatori, ma anche per il possibile impatto sulla sosta e per la carenza di colonnine di ricarica elettrica. Il leghista Giulio Venturi, invece, punta il dito contro i 30 orari: \"Considero la proposta poco sensata. Trovo preoccupante che ci sia chi spinga per un utilizzo della tecnologia, anche in ambiti non necessari, pur di apparire paladino di una sostenibilità che ha poco a che vedere con una realtà complessa come quella della viabilità a Bologna\".\nred.cro.\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "2024-02-16 06:30:00 Do you find red roses tacky? Why not give your loved one a bioluminescent plant? Especially since he or she will be able to continue admiring your gift once the light goes out. The American start-up Light Bio has been authorized to market “Firefly Petunia” in the United States, a petunia which emits green light in the dark. The company that sells its product for $29 incorporated genes from a bioluminescent fungus called Neonothopanus nambi into the plant, according to the journal [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00383-3?s=08). In this way, it produces enzymes capable of converting the caffeic acid it creates naturally into luciferin, a light-emitting molecule, which it then recycles into caffeic acid to maintain its bioluminescence. VOS INDICES source Non-existent risks of propagation “If you treat the plant well, it gets enough sunlight and it’s healthy, it will shine brighter,” Karen Sarkisyan, co-founder of the Idaho-based startup, assures Nature. Not enough to disturb the sleep of plant owners, however, according to this synthetic biology researcher. The Firefly Petunia produces light with an intensity similar to that of the full moon, he describes. With his colleagues, he chose to cultivate the petunia because it is very popular in the United States as an ornamental plant. The species he turned to in particular is not native to North America and is not considered invasive. Enough to reduce to zero the risks of propagation of modified genes in native plants, which would have the consequence of disrupting ecosystems. For the moment, Light Bio has received around 50,000 pre-orders for plants which it will deliver – a little later than Valentine’s Day – in April.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) By Skyler Swisher | | Orlando Sentinel PUBLISHED: June 27, 2024 at 5:12 p.m. | UPDATED: June 27, 2024 at 5:14 p.m. A Democrat running for Orange County supervisor of elections filed a lawsuit Thursday that seeks to get another candidate for the office removed from the ballot.\nDan Helm is accusing no-party candidate Cynthia Harris of not properly paying her qualifying fee, making her ineligible to appear on the Nov. 5 ballot.\n“If we are not playing by all the rules, the integrity of the ballot is at stake,” he said. “I can’t look the other way.”\nHelm, an Orlando lawyer, filed the suit in Orange County Court against Harris and Elections Supervisor Glen Gilzean.\nHarris denied Helm’s accusations and said he has been pestering her about dropping out of the contest.\n“I know my stuff is in order,” she said. “He should be worried about his own race instead of mine.”\nIf Helm prevails, it will open the Aug. 20 Democratic primary for elections supervisor to all voters. Harris is the only non-Democratic candidate in the race. If she were disqualified, Republicans and no-party voters would be eligible to participate in the primary because the Democratic winner would face no opposition in the general election.\nThe other Democratic candidates are Orange County School Board member Karen Castor Dentel, former Orange Democratic chairman Wes Hodge and real estate broker “Sunshine” Linda-Marie Grund.\nOrange County election supervisor candidates Karen Castor Dentel, Cynthia Harris, Dan Helm, Wes Hodge and Sunshine Grund participate in a League of Women Voters forum, June 12, 2024 (Steven Lemongello) Helm’s suit centers on the rules for paying a qualifying fee. Candidates are required to pay their filing fee from a dedicated campaign bank account, a measure in place to ensure transparency in campaign finance.\nRecords attached to the suit show that Harris paid her $7,736.76 fee on June 14, the qualifying deadline, with a check that had “campaign acct” written on it. The bank listed on the check is TD Bank.\nBut Helm alleges that the check did not align with the banks Harris listed on her paperwork. On Oct. 2, she filed a form that listed “Additions Financial,” according to court records. Another form dated May 28 listed Fairwinds as the bank.\nChristopher Heath, a spokesman for the Orange election office, said the office is aware of the lawsuit and will respond in court.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",

    "text": "With no misty air, rain, or other weather impediments hampering what became a showcase New Year’s Day hockey event for those watching from the stands, Kraken goalie Joey Daccord promptly went out and did away with any lingering on-ice concerns. The only rain at any point thereafter was the constant chants of “Jo-ey! Jo-ey!” raining down from most of 47,313 pumped-up fans as Daccord made 35 saves in a 3-0 win over the Vegas Golden Knights, logging MVP honors for the first shutout in Winter Classic history.\n“It’s truly the coolest thing in the world to have that,” said Daccord, a self-professed hockey history buff who had a huge contingent of family and friends from his native Boston travel in for the game. “Just to have that support from them…we have the best fans in the world. It was so much fun hearing that and then just hearing that support throughout the game.”\nPeople are also reading… Man found dead in NW Lincoln lake after report of submerged car Fourth generation set to lead Lincoln's largest bank Lincoln man lied on food stamp application, defrauded government of more than $25K, officials say Grain elevator in the heart of Lincoln up for sale Lancaster County Sheriff to put six automatic license plate readers along I-80 Double blessings: Twin brothers welcome babies on same day in Lincoln Ruling allows Nebraska employees to continue working remotely — for now LFR responds to fire at Lazlo's in south Lincoln Shooting suspect arrested in I-80 traffic stop, Nebraska State Patrol says These 4 moms, home in Waterloo for the holidays, always can ask a sister for baby advice Amie Just: Predicting 2024 for Nebraska Athletics — and beyond Nebraska football reserve linebacker enters transfer portal 'I don't believe in welfare' — Nebraska Gov.

And they kept on scoring early in periods from there, with Will Borgen slapping one home from the top of the right circle barely two minutes into the second period and Yanni Gourde potting his own rebound off a breakaway chance a couple of minutes into the final frame.\nSomewhat incidental to the broader spectacle of the game itself, though definitely not inconsequential to their season, the win was the Kraken’s fifth straight and enabled them to set a franchise record with points in nine consecutive contests. That 7-0-2 run, also an NHL record by a team immediately rebounding from an eight-game losing streak, has helped the Kraken climb to within a point of the final Western Conference wild-card spot.\nCombined with near-perfect January conditions of 46.1 degrees at puck drop, with midgame sunlight peeking through moderate clouds, it was a banner hockey day all around for both the city and the team representing it.\nThe “Jo-ey! Jo-ey!” cheers began in the opening period when Daccord stopped Jack Eichel on a breakaway try. And they continued through the final two minutes after Daccord robbed robbed Eichel with a glove save to keep the shutout intact with the Vegas netminder pulled for an extra attacker.\nOtherwise, the Tolvanen goal got the huge crowd roaring in a hurry while a first intermission performance of “Barracuda” and “Magic Man” by Heart — fresh off a New Year’s Eve concert at Climate Pledge Arena the night before — kept the stands rocking. Perhaps feeding off that energy, the Kraken grabbed a two-goal lead just 2:19 into the second period when Will Borgen slapped a puck past Logan Thompson for his first goal of the season.\nIf any one Kraken player used the Winter Classic to increase his profile tenfold, it might have been Borgen. Beyond scoring the goal, he also featured prominently in the TNT docuseries “Road to the Winter Classic” giving demonstrations on his cookie baking skills among other things.\n2024 NHL Winter Classic Picks & Props | Vegas Golden Knights vs Seattle Kraken Bets | Line Change\nKraken minority owner and former Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch drew the day’s loudest applause during a second intermission on-field “interview” with Mariners broadcaster Rick Rizzs shown on the JumboTron. Lynch was playful but a man of few words, to which ex-Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselback — among the many sports dignitaries being honored on-field — took the microphone and said, “He’s just here so he won’t get fined.”\nThat Hasselback take off Lynch’s words during media day in January 2015 before 2015 Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, drew even more thunderous applause from the stands.\nThose cheers were still ringing when the puck dropped for the third period and Gourde soon raced in alone on Thompson, who made the first save but couldn’t prevent the rebound from going in. At that moment, the way Daccord has played the past month, it was pretty obvious the Kraken would win for only the second time in 10 games against Vegas since inception.\nIn fact, midway through the third, plenty of fans appeared to be heading for the exits early, perhaps seeking an early jump to the commute home to catch the opening of the Washington Huskies-Texas Longhorns in the College Football Playoff semifinal in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. And the Kraken, among the league leaders in overtime games played, will undoubtedly take a rare outing where their fans felt comfortable enough to call a game that quickly.",

    "text": "HONfest is no more, according to an email Wednesday from Wendy Sites, HONfest vendor and logistics coordinator.\n“For thirty years HONfest celebrated working women and showcased local artisans, food vendors, and musicians,” Sites wrote in her email. “However, those of use who work hard to make HONfest happen have decided to retire, and with that retirement comes the end of HONfest.”\nDenise Whiting, owner of the former\nCafe Hon, first held a “Baltimore Best Hon” pageant in 1994. Over the years, the event grew into an annual summertime festival, with attendees donning beehive hairdos, cat eye glasses, feather boas, pearl necklaces, and other “hon” accessories meant to hearken back to working class women of the 1950s and 1960s.\nThough a yearly favorite for many Baltimore residents, the event drew criticism in 2023 when organizers\ndenied a vendor spot to Planned Parenthood Maryland, citing the festival’s policy for prohibiting vendors related to “political, religious, and hot topic issues.”\n“For 20 years, HONfest has brought smiles to young and old alike. HONfest has always had rules on their vendor form prohibiting ‘political, religious, and hot topic issues,'” HONfest organizers posted on Facebook in June 2023. “Since the overturning of the Roe V Wade decision, it has certainly become an issue which has led to some very unfortunate public incidences, and as such, it has become a ‘hot topic’.”\nPlanned Parenthood Maryland said HONfest organizers told them they could participate in the festival if they abided by a “gag rule.”\n“Prohibiting us from mentioning birth control, abortion, gender affirming care and providing any information about family planning stigmatizes our care, and more importantly, the patients for whom we care,” Planned Parenthood Maryland officials said at the time.\nThe decision prompted supporters of Planned Parenthood Maryland to call for a boycott of HONfest. Existing HONfest vendors and Hampden businesses pledged their support by offering the reproductive healthcare nonprofit a spot at their vendor tables or comitting a percentage of their business’s sales to the organization. Other Baltimore festivals, such as Remfest and Lauraville Fair, invited the nonprofit to be part of their events.\nFollowing the blowback from community members, HONfest organizers reversed their decision and invited Planned Parenthood Maryland to be part of the festival.\nBut for many the change of heart came too late. The nonprofit declined the invitation, but was still present in Hampden during the festival at Flaunt Hair Boutique.\nSites’ email message on Wednesday made no mention of the 2023 incident with Planned Parenthood Maryland.\nThe Baltimore Banner\nreported that Sites said the decision to end HONfest came as a result of the needs of the organizers’ aging parents as well as life changes.\n“It was an amazing festival which brought joy to so many people for many years, and we couldn’t be more proud of what the festival brought to the city of Baltimore and the Hampden neighborhood,” Sites’ email read. “We could not have accomplished that without ALL OF YOU!”\nSites went on to thank the vendors who participated in the festival over the years.\n“You, the vendors who have come to HONfest, are a spectial breed of people, kind, loving, and generous,” she said. “The hours you put into your work, the time you take to travel from festival to festival, and the kindeness you expressed when dealing with HONfest staff is a testament to the amazing humans you are. We will miss all of you, but what you brought to HONfest and to Baltimore will stay in our hearts for years to come.”",

    "text": "Em celebração dos 80 anos do Dia D. Joe Biden fez discurso efusivo atacando Vladimir Putin: \"As forças das trevas nunca desaparecem\"\nNesta quinta-feira, 6, o presidente norte-americano Joe Biden discursou na celebração dos 80 anos do Dia D — como a\nInvasão da Normandia, um dos episódios mais célebres da Segunda Guerra, também é conhecida. Em 6 de junho de 1944, os Aliados começaram a libertação da França, que sofria na garra dos nazistas. + Há 80 anos, acontecia o Dia D: Do planejamento a construção do mito\nNas suas falas, repercute a Folha de São Paulo, Biden aproveitou para comparar a ameaça de\nAdolf Hitler com as recentes ações do presidente russo Vladimir Putin, que invadiu a Ucrânia em meados de fevereiro de 2022.\n\"As forças das trevas nunca desaparecem. A Ucrânia foi invadida por um tirano e nunca se rendeu\", disse o presidente do país que criou a OTAN em 1949 — organização que visa proteger a Europa Ocidental da então União Soviética (hoje Rússia), que foi o principal aliado norte-americano na Segunda Guerra.\nAinda conforme a Folha, Biden também se juntou a diversos chefes de Estado em um evento internacional que marca os 80 anos do Dia D; onde o presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky também esteve presente.\nHitler pensava que as democracias eram frágeis, que o futuro era dos ditadores\", continuou em seu discurso. \"Não se engane: nós não iremos nos curvar, não podemos nos render aos valentões, isso é simplesmente impensável. Se o fizermos, a liberdade será subjugada, toda a Europa estará ameaçada\".\n\"Nós devemos nos perguntar: iremos novamente nos levantar contra o mal, contra a brutalidade esmagadora? Vamos nos unir pela liberdade, defender a democracia? Vamos nos unir? Minha resposta é sim, e só pode ser sim\", prosseguiu. \"Nós não vamos nos afastar [do apoio a Kiev]. Se o fizermos, [Putin] não vai parar ali. Autocratas no mundo todo estão olhando atentamente\".",
