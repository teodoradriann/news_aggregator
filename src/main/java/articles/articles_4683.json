He is seated with (left to right) Allison Hatfield, chief of staff for the state Department of Commerce, Jake Windley, director of legislative affairs and policies for the department of commerce, and Alan McClain, Arkansas Insurance Commissioner. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)\nThis story was update at 7:30 p.m. to add a statement from the governor’s office.\nArkansas lawmakers on Thursday rejected a proposed rule that would have allowed pharmacists to be paid a dispensing fee by drug middlemen who reimburse them for prescription costs.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Members of the Administrative Rules subcommittee of the Arkansas Legislative Council spent about two hours questioning the Insurance Department’s legal counsel about the necessity for the proposal before rejecting it by voice vote. There was at least one audible dissent.\nThe rule would have allowed the insurance commissioner to determine the amount health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) would have to tack on to reimbursements to pharmacists, department legal counsel Booth Rand told lawmakers Thursday.\nThe dispensing fee could range from zero to a maximum of $10 based on data collected from PBMs and other interested parties, Rand said. An earlier survey of health plans projected an increase in health premiums between 3% and 4% if the dispensing fee was $9.\nThe rule was intended to replace an emergency rule approved in September that expires in mid-January. The emergency measure authorized the Insurance Department to review reimbursement rates to “ensure that pharmacies will at least be paid [federally determined] minimums” and to add a dispensing fee if the commissioner determines a pharmacy’s reimbursement “is not fair and reasonable.” A 2015 state law regulating PBMs, requires reimbursements to be “fair and reasonable” but doesn’t define the term.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement In response to a question from Rep. Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, Rand said the department has the authority to collect the data without the rule, “but if the commissioner decided to impose a fee, the PBMs could object that there’s no rule in place authorizing it.”\nPBMs are companies that negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers.\nThe nation’s three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, OptumRX and Express Scripts — are owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the prescription market in the United States, according to a Federal Trade Commission interim study released in July.\nCurrent PBM practices are “unfair and unreasonable, not only to independent pharmacies but chain pharmacies as well,” Rep. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said Thursday. Ultimately, this affects “our constituents,” patients who don’t know who to complain to if their pharmacy closes or they have an issue with prescription payments by their insurer, she said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Wisconsin school shooter was in contact with a California man accused of planning separate attack, report says CNN Passengers panic as American Airlines flight ‘floods’ in midair: ‘New fear unlocked’ NY Post Ex-Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson facing warrants for arrest in Texas USA TODAY Sports Highest-earning NYPD cop with OT-fueled $400,000 salary retires following Daily News exposé NY Daily News “When you control 80% of the prescriptions,” Flowers said of PBMs, “you have control over determining the formularies, you silence your pharmacists who must contract with you because you control all of the prescriptions, you own pharmacies, you own insurance companies … How do we ensure what is fair and reasonable within the law since they basically control the business, control the market, control reimbursements?”\nAllison Hatfield, Commerce Department chief of staff, responded, “We see this rule as a mechanism to enforce the fair and reasonable language in the law.”\nAsked by subcommittee co-chair Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, how that would increase the cost of business, Hatfield replied “there would be no change,” if a PBM is paying a fair and reasonable reimbursement rate.\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Some lawmakers said they also viewed the proposal as giving the insurance commissioner blanket authority to impose a fee without further legislative input.\n Rule-making should occur within the constraints of existing law, Shepherd said, but “shouldn’t be viewed as blank-check authority.”\nSens. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, and Jimmy Hickey Jr., R-Texarkana, also objected to giving the insurance commissioner the authority to levy an indeterminate dispensing fee, saying it usurps legislative authority.\n“We can’t delegate our authority to an individual,” Hickey said.\nIrvin called the proposal tantamount to levying a new tax on consumers because the cost of a dispensing fee would be passed on to them.\nAdvertisement Advertisement “I don’t agree you have the authority through the [PBM] licensing act … to create a new tax,” she said.\nIrvin said much the same thing on Monday during a five-hour debate on the proposed rule in the Joint Insurance and Commerce Committee that ended when the panel’s chairman declared the proposal reviewed.\nRepublican Sen. Mark Johnson of Little Rock asked Rand what would happen if the proposed rule failed to pass the committee.\n“You’re likely going to get a dispensing fee bill from pharmacies” in the 2025 legislative session, Rand replied.\nTuesday evening, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement saying her administration will not allow PBMs “to skirt the law” and will continue to hold PBMs accountable. She cited the $1.5 million fine “we imposed on rule-breaking PBMs this summer.” The administration will also continue to work the the Legislature to “further protect Arkansans,” she said.\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 20,000 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "The northern lights made a rare Illinois appearance on Monday, Oct. 7, and lit up social media. But the colorful, dancing, atmospheric light show's sequel could be even better. Social media was abuzz with reports of the Monday light show. The Northern Lights Illinois Facebook page includes accounts and photos from Chicago, central Illinois and elsewhere. The US National Weather Service Central Illinois Facebook page also posted pictures from Monday. But Ed Shimon, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service branch in Lincoln, said the best may be yet to come. \"The big show will be Thursday night,\" he said. \"Get your tickets now,\" he joked. Peak Illinois viewing could begin as early as 9 p.m. and continue until 3 a.m. Friday morning, he said. Overnight on Thursday, Oct. 10, another \"powerful\" northern lights display is expected, Shimon said, possibly extending as far south as Alabama — a \"highly unusual\" occurrence. In Illinois, he predicted \"brilliant colors,\" cloud cover permitting. \"It looks pretty good\" for a multicolored display, he said. Friday into Saturday may offer a lesser display, he added. More: Earth's new mini moon: Will we be able to see it in Illinois? What are the northern lights? The northern lights are a type of aurora , a natural light display caused by disturbances in the Earth's upper atmosphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, these displays are called aurora borealis, aurora polaris, or northern lights. Normally, these natural light shows are only visible at higher, more northern, latitudes. During geomagnetic storms, they can appear farther south, including Illinois. The northern lights can appear as green, pink, purple or blue rays, sometimes with a red border. Can you see the northern lights tonight? Shimon expects a lesser experience on Wednesday, Oct. 9. \"A little bit of a break,\" he said, before Thursday. The northern lights are expected to be most visible in Illinois on Thursday, Oct. 10, into Friday, Oct. 11. How to view the northern lights The best time, of course, is after sundown. The best place is in dark spaces, away from city lights. Camera tips for the northern lights Don't be discouraged by what you see at first, Shimon says. Sometimes, your camera - even on your phone - will capture the beauty of the lights better than your eyes. \"Your camera will almost always capture the image of the lights better than your eyes can see them.\" More: Illinois community among best places to live, according to Money.

    "text": "92歲的趙婆婆患有多重慢性疾病，包括高血壓、高膽固醇、皮膚發炎、支氣管炎、認知障礙症及骨質疏鬆，需定期到醫院覆診及服藥。近年身體轉差，照顧工作也變得更形繁重。幸好，她身邊有一位無微不至且不離不棄的照護者——女兒葉秀芬。\n今年59歲的葉女士，原本有一份她穩定的的全職工作。為了母親的飲食健康，她毅然辭去工作，成為全職護老者。「一切由零開始，連烹飪（針對其母需要）我都要重新學。」她笑言照顧母親是一項新挑戰。\n她不僅負責日常膳食的安排，還主動進修照顧技巧，時刻留意家居安全及母親的身心需要。在軟餐照護飲食領域，她最近接觸到一個名為「軟心膳」的點心拼盤，為照顧飲食帶來新的轉機。\n「以前做糊餐或碎餐，最大的困難就是味道和賣相欠佳，媽媽沒胃口。我試過『軟心膳』後，覺得它味道有驚喜，賣相吸引，媽媽也吃得開心。」她分享道。最重要是，軟餐為她繁重的照顧工作帶來巨大幫助，一舉兩得。「我不用再花幾小時準備每餐，省下許多煮食時間 ，她吃得開心，我也輕鬆不少。」她感慨道。\n「我吃蝦餃、燒賣、菜肉餃。」趙婆婆指著桌上的「點心」說道。但這些並不是普通的點心，而是老人家也嚼得動的軟餐。趙婆婆的女兒對記者說，母親平時吃飯要戴假牙，咀嚼力量有限，吃到有硬度的東西只能吐出来。早前因受傷無法吃飯，體重更一度跌到30多公斤，令她擔心不己。葉女士坦言，全職照顧長者時間緊張，以往需花費早晨帶母親到酒樓吃早餐，如今有營養師設計的軟餐， 既省時又能兼顧營養與食慾 ，成為她照護路上的「第二雙手」。\n而當被問到是否希望嘗到新口味軟餐時，趙婆婆立即笑言希望吃到魚蛋、牛肉腸粉、叉燒包等。",

    "text": "Judicial “Desde mi punto de vista, considero que en Cali nos fue bien”: José Gualdrón, comandante saliente de la Policía Metropolitana de la ciudad El uniformado explicó por qué no se logró cumplir con la meta de tener menos de 1000 homicidios en la ciudad en el 2023 y reveló cuál fue el momento más complejo estando al frente de la Institución en la capital del Valle. [Por: Redacción El País](/autor/redaccion-el-pais/) Por: Anderson Zapata Reyes / Editor de Orden Fueron aproximadamente 16 meses los que estuvo al frente de la Policía Metropolitana de Cali el brigadier general José Daniel Gualdrón, algo que desde el primer día él calificó como un gran reto debido a las complejidades criminales que caracterizan a nuestra ciudad. Prueba de ello es que el pasado jueves la ciudad superó los 1000 homicidios y no se pudo cumplir el objetivo que desde la Policía se habían trazado a inicio de año que era estar por debajo de los 900 casos. A pesar de esto, el general Gualdrón, que desde enero próximo asumirá la dirección de la Policía en Bogotá, dijo: “Cali hace dos años estaba en el puesto número 22 de las ciudades más violentas del mundo, pero ahora quedó en el lugar 32 y la idea es que salga de ese listado. Para eso hemos ido trabajando”. En entrevista con El País, el uniformado explicó por qué se superaron los 1000 asesinatos en la ciudad, contó cuál fue el momento más complejo que vivió en Cali y reconoció que faltó más trabajo de la Policía y la Secretaría de Seguridad con los jóvenes, las mujeres y la población vulnerable. ¿Cómo se enteró de la noticia de que debía salir de la comandancia de la Policía de Cali y, desde enero, asumir las riendas de la Institución en Bogotá? Nosotros sabemos que hay unas dinámicas de país y de cambios de mandatarios locales en toda la nación. Después de año y medio de estar en Cali, nuestro Director General tomó la decisión de hacer cambios del personal de servicio y nosotros estamos prestos a ello. Yo llevo más de 35 años de servicio y he tenido más de 16 traslados de unidades, por lo que he podido trabajar con distintos gobernantes y hemos venido adquiriendo experiencias. Me enteré por medio de una llamada telefónica de esta nueva responsabilidad y el trasegar institucional es así. ¿Por qué cree que pensaron en usted para asumir la dirección de la Policía en la capital del país? Son valoraciones que hace nuestro director frente a resultados, experiencias y conocimientos. Creo que uno de los puntos que se debe tener en cuenta es que he trabajado en varias ocasiones en Bogotá de subteniente, de teniente coronel y coronel, por lo que conozco muchas dinámicas criminales de calle. Ahora, con la experiencia que he adquirido a nivel directivo y estratégico, nos da un poco más de margen para poder aportar y sumar. Además, creo que gracias al trabajo articulado de la Policía, la comunidad y las autoridades en Cali se han obtenido buenos resultados. ¿Usted considera que en su paso por Cali le fue bien o mal? Yo creo que la valoración la dejamos en manos de la ciudadanía y de todos los medios. Pero a mi juicio, nos fue bien. Nos fue bien porque si comparamos el cierre del año pasado, terminamos por debajo de 1000 homicidios y fue la cifra más baja respecto a este delito en los últimos 30 años y se salvaron más de 250 vidas. Para el 2023 nos colocamos como meta estar igual o por debajo, pero no logramos cumplirla. Aún así sería la segunda tasa más baja de los últimos 30 años. Sobre el tema de hurto a personas, si lo comparamos con el año anterior, los estoy dejando en verde y no perdemos ningún punto comparado estadísticamente. Yo recibí la ciudad con más de 100 hechos de robos diariamente y hoy la estoy entregando en 50 casos diarios aproximadamente. Si miramos cifras, datos y hechos, Cali es una ciudad que viene mejorando en temas de seguridad y está siendo vista, no solo por la comunidad nacional, sino por la internacional para organizar muchos eventos. Esto es gracias a lo que se ha ido mejorando, poco a poco, en materia de seguridad. Recibí 600 frentes de seguridad y estoy entregando 1300. Me reuní con más de 15 comunas en territorio y pienso que una de las actividades de reconocimiento es volver a retomar la confianza y, ante todo, trabajar con ellos, pues venimos de una situación compleja luego del Paro Nacional. Eso sí, debo reconocer que nos falta mejorar en la formas de comunicar para dar a conocer todo lo que se hace desde la Policía. ¿No es año y medio muy poco tiempo para desarrollar las estrategias y trabajar en una ciudad? Dentro de las estrategias que tenemos establecidas para determinar qué podemos hacer, uno pensaría que año y medio es poco tiempo, pero somos una Institución en la que se trabaja con procesos y procedimientos y los oficiales tenemos como derrotero de trabajo seguir el legado y las estrategias que se han colocado en marcha para continuar reduciendo los delitos. Por ejemplo, los días 1, 2 y 3 de enero tengo una reunión con el coronel Oviedo, que es quien quedará a cargo de la Policía en esta ciudad, y allí plantearemos todo lo que se está trabajando y las cosas que quedaron pendientes por hacer. Creemos que ellos continuarán con las prioridades que tenemos: la primera de ellas es seguir haciendo la contención del homicidio, pues la gran mayoría de los casos de sicariato están relacionados con temas de narcotráfico ya que del 100% de los homicidios, más del 85 % han estado dirigidos a personas que han tenido antecedentes judiciales. Este año, por temas de intolerancia y riñas se nos presentaron alrededor de 120 asesinatos, mientras que por hurtos a mano armada 12 personas lamentablemente fueron asesinadas. En feminicidios se registraron 12 casos y logramos esclarecer 10. ¿Cuál será la principal recomendación que le dará al nuevo comandante de la Policía Metropolitana de Cali? La más importante es buscar la manera de articularse con las policías judiciales e inteligencia, Secretaría de Seguridad y Justicia y comunidad. Todo esto sin dejar a un lado todas las fuentes de información que podemos tener como medios de comunicación o redes sociales, pues gracias a que hay un equipo analizando estas plataformas se lograron esclarecer muchos hechos. Al Coronel Oviedo le digo que hay que seguir siendo incesante contra el delito y la delincuencia que está afectando al ciudadano de a pie, pues hay que continuar bajando las estadísticas de hurto. ¿Cómo se trabajó con la Secretaría de Seguridad y Justicia? ¿Qué sensación le quedó? Siento que faltó más trabajo de campo con el tema relacionado con las juventudes, con las poblaciones en riesgo y con nuestras mujeres. Pienso que nos faltó articularnos más en temas sociales y policiales en el sentido de estar con los habitantes de calle. Además, nos faltó mucho en lo referente al mejoramiento de entornos, iluminarlos y limpiar las basuras, pues a la vista genera intranquilidad y esto le brinda confort al delincuente. ¿Cuál fue el momento más complejo en este año y medio en Cali? Para mí fue muy impactante lo que ocurrió con la niña Michelle Dayana, que fue asesinada y desmembrada el día de las velitas en Cali. Esto me marcó porque yo llegué al sitio y vi realmente la forma en la que murió la menor y eso personalmente fue un reto porque fui el encargado de darle la noticia al padre, le dije: [ “Desafortunadamente no le puedo devolver a su hija porque ya se encuentra en el cielo, pero voy a capturar al delincuente que cometió esta violación”. ](https://www.elpais.com.co/judicial/asesino-de-la-menor-michelle-dayana-es-trasladado-a-la-carcel-de-combita-boyaca-2709.html) Allí fue cuando activamos todas nuestras capacidades y el Director General también estuvo muy pendiente y me dio la orden de capturar al presunto homicida. Realizamos un gran trabajo con la Alcaldía y la Secretaría de Seguridad y Justicia. Ustedes no se imaginan el gran número de llamadas y fotografías que en esos tres días recibimos. También me impactó mucho cuando la ciudad fue víctima de la explosión de algunas granadas en Cais, producto de la estructura delincuencial Jaime Martínez. Una de las grandes críticas a esta administración fue la inseguridad en estaciones y buses del MÍO. De hecho, se firmó un convenio con la Policía, pero ¿quedó usted tranquilo con eso? El convenio es muy bueno y los resultados están mostrando el trabajo. Antes estos lugares nos aportaban casi el 45 % de los hurtos a personas por temas de cosquilleo y con este convenio se bajó al 20 %. Hemos priorizado 16 estaciones y algunas zonas complejas de acceso a las mismas. Queda uno intranquilo porque las capacidades de personal son insuficientes, pues son 106 hombres y mujeres los dedicados a la seguridad y entre ellos unos bachilleres destinados a actividades de seguridad y prevención. Eso sí, hay espacios en que las estaciones quedan solas por temas de turnos. Con la prórroga hasta abril del convenio, probablemente se va a incrementar mucho más el personal. Pero la Alcaldía y la gerencia del MÍO deben instalar cámaras de video para poder buscar la manera de que nos ayude en los procesos investigativos y que eso sea un medio de disuasión. ¿Está muy rezagada Cali en materia de infraestructura al servicio de la seguridad? Nosotros ya nos reunimos con el alcalde electo, Alejandro Eder, y analizamos lo que hay que hacer respecto a renovación de parque automotor y adquisición de material tecnológico como cámaras. [Hay que renovar todo el tema del 123 y nuestros sistemas de comunicaciones con repetidoras y radios porque ya llevan más de 28 años. Considero que a futuro se busca un buen cambio en temas de inversión, infraestructura, tecnología y movilidad, ](https://www.elpais.com.co/judicial/el-complejo-panorama-de-la-policia-de-cali-equipos-con-obsolescencia-de-10-anos-poca-renovacion-de-vehiculos-y-falta-de-personal-0615.html)situaciones que se deben ver reflejadas en temas de seguridad. ¿Qué le dijeron ellos en esa reunión? ¿Hay presupuesto o no para hacerla? Están en la discusión y tienen todo el optimismo y el apoyo, tanto la gobernadora electa como Alejandro Eder tienen toda la disposición para apoyar a la Fuerza Pública en lo que requiere, pero así mismo nos exigirán resultados para que la ciudadanía vea reflejados sus impuestos y tengan más tranquilidad.",

    "text": "Los New York Mets y el jardinero Jesse Winker llegaron a un acuerdo por una temporada a cambio de $8 millones de dólares , según un informe del analista de MLB Network, Jon Heyman.\nEl contrato incluye un bono por firmar de $1 millón de dólares según Heyman, está pendiente de un examen físico. El equipo no ha confirmado.\nWinker fue adquirido por los Mets proveniente de Washington el 28 de julio y bateó para .243 con tres jonrones y 13 carreras impulsadas con Nueva York el año pasado.\nConectó un triple de dos carreras que empató el juego en el primer partido de la serie de comodines en Milwaukee contra Brewers, bateó un jonrón frente a Aaron Nola de Filadelfia en el tercer juego de la serie divisional y conectó un triple impulsor en el quinto duelo de la Serie de Campeonato de la Liga Nacional contra los Dodgers de Los Ángeles.\nWinker bateó para .253, con 14 jonrones y 58 carreras impulsadas la temporada pasada, luego se convirtió en agente libre.\n¿Jesse Winker sustituto de Pete Alonso? Winker, de 31 años, puede defender ambas esquinas en los jardines. Podría tener muchas apariciones en el plato como bateador designado para los Mets la próxima temporada, junto con el dominicano Starling Marte, después de que el club firmó al jardinero derecho Juan Soto con un contrato récord de 765 millones de dólares y 15 años en la agencia libre.\nEn ocho temporadas en las Grandes Ligas, Winker acumula un promedio de .262 con 95 cuadrangulares y 324 carreras impulsadas con Cincinnati (2017-21), Seattle (2022), Milwaukee (2023), los Nacionales y los Mets . Fue elegido al Juego de Estrellas en 2021, cuando alcanzó un tope personal de .305 con 24 jonrones y 71 carreras impulsadas.\nAlonso también se convirtió en agente libre después de la temporada y el primera base ha mantenido conversaciones con los Mets sin llegar a un acuerdo. El trato con Winker podría ser una señal de que Nueva York está cambiando la atención y los recursos en una dirección diferente.\nAlonso, cuatro veces All-Star y que cumplió 30 años el 7 de diciembre, ha conectado 226 jonrones en seis temporadas con los Mets.\nSeguir leyendo:",
