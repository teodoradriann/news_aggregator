    "title": "Ethiopia: Macroeconomic Reforms - Changing Face of FDI - allAfrica.com",
    "text": "Ethiopia's recent macroeconomic reforms, implemented during last July, are beginning to yield positive outcomes for the nation's economic landscape, particularly in the realm of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The Ethiopian Investment Commission (EIC) reports a notable 12% increase in FDI flows over the past three months compared to the same period last year, signaling a robust recovery in investment activities.\nA key reform allowing foreign wholesalers and retailers to operate within the local market has particularly drawn interest from new investors. EIC Deputy Commissioner Zeleke Temesgen (PhD) noted, \"About 72 investors have expressed interest in the newly opened sectors; 42 aim to engage in importing commodities, while 31 seek to invest in the export sector.\" So far, 22 proposals have been submitted, with 18 investors already licensed to commence operations.\nDuring a recent address to the joint session of the House of People's Representatives and the House of Federation, President Taye Atseke-Selassie outlined ambitious economic goals for the fiscal year, projecting an 8.4% growth rate, with value-added exports anticipated to reach five billion USD and total export revenues hitting 10 billion USD.\nZeleke highlighted an influx of Chinese investors following the reforms, which have significantly bolstered Ethiopia's economy through capital flow, job creation, and technological advancements. Currently, there are about 3,303 Chinese projects in Ethiopia, with a combined portfolio valued at 8.5 billion USD. Since 2022, 322 new Chinese investors have been licensed, demonstrating a significant increase in their activity.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Ethiopia Business Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

Notably, the Eastern Industrial Park in Dukem, home to 153 manufacturing companies, is predominantly occupied by Chinese firms.\nIn the last fiscal year, Ethiopia attracted 3.9 billion USD in FDI, marking a 14% increase from the preceding year.\nChinese firms operating in Ethiopia have expressed optimism regarding the recent reforms. Accordingly, Linda-Ethiopia Garment's Director General GeYifan noted that the new market-oriented foreign currency regime has eased prior challenges, allowing his company to better serve the local market. \"The government has provided us with better opportunities and investment incentives,\" he stated.\nSimilarly, Huajian Aluminum PLC's General Manager David Zhou praised the government's efforts to address foreign currency shortages and create new opportunities in various sectors. \"While we are currently supplying the local market, we plan to export as challenges are resolved,\" he said.\nEIC's another Deputy Commissioner, Dagato Kunbie, emphasized the positive reception of legal reforms enabling foreign participation in wholesale and retail trading. \"We have received numerous requests from foreign investors following the announcement of this reform, and several companies will soon enter the local market,\" he noted, reiterating the government's commitment to support foreign investors who make significant contributions to the local economy.\nWith projections exceeding five billion USD in new investments, Ethiopia is poised for a sharp increase in FDI, promising to enhance its economic landscape further.\nRead the original article on Ethiopian Herald .",

    "title": "Chiefs Legend Dante Hall: Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce ‘Acting Like Spoiled Little Brats’",
    "text": "A lot is going wrong for the\n Kansas City Chiefs with just two games remaining in the regular season. But former Chiefs player Dante Hall, who was inducted into the team’s Ring of Honor earlier this year, has some helpful advice for quarterback Patrick Mahomes that could help him right the ship offensively.\n“Patrick Mahomes, I love you, you’re my favorite quarterback. But I think you need to fall in love with the mundane,” Hall said while on Good Morning Football on\nDecember 27. “Yes, for five years we’ve been used to the big plays to Tyreek (Hill), to (Travis) Kelce, and all of that. It’s time to be checkdown Tom Brady. Fall in love with the swing route, the checkdowns. These plays have been there for the taking, and that’s pretty much what we need to get back to, right?”\nBut that’s not the only advice he had for Mahomes. When asked by co-panelist and NFL insider Peter Schrager for his thoughts on Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce’s recent sideline outbursts, Hall was very blunt and put Kansas City’s star players on blast.\n“It’s like my little kids running around here on Christmas Day. We got you a Christmas tree filled with presents, and you’re acting like spoiled little brats.\n“These guys know I love them. So, as a friend, as a brother, I had to call you out. This is not a good look. I’m watching the game with my kids, my daughter loves Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, and you’re acting like that? C’mon, guys! Be better, and I think the team will be better.”\nThough Mahomes has failed to consistently rely on his checkdowns to move the chains, the Chiefs coaching staff has made a concerted effort to get the ball out of his hands quickly and near the line of scrimmage.\nAgainst the\nLas Vegas Raiders on Christmas Day, 21 of Mahomes’s 27 completions were within five yards of the line of scrimmage, per Next Gen Stats. 17 of those completions came at or behind the line of scrimmage.\nMany of those completions were designed screen passes to get the ball in the hands of players such as Kelce and\nRashee Rice, who are two of the best in the NFL after the catch.\nIn the end, that strategy didn’t help Kansas City put enough points on the board to beat its division rival. But if the defending Super Bowl champions can clean up their turnover issue, then that same strategy can be more effective moving forward.\nDante Hall Has 2 More Pieces of Advice\nAlong with his advice for Mahomes, Hall also aimed at Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, who Hall speculates is at the forefront of Kansas City’s offensive issues.\n“When Eric Bieniemy was [with the Chiefs], we didn’t have this lack of discipline, we didn’t have guys not lining up, we didn’t have guys dropping a league-leading 25 passes, we didn’t have none of this,” Hall said. “So, is it Nagy? Is it Bieniemy? I don’t know. But I would like to start there — it starts at the top, right? You’re the offensive coordinator, you — besides JuJu Smith-Schuster leaving — are the only change in this Super Bowl-winning offense, so it must be you. Get these guys in order.”\nHall’s last bit of advice was to the team as a whole and how they present themselves on game day.\n“Body language is everything. When you are screaming and yelling at your players, that permeates negativity,” Hall continued. “What you have had in [the first five years with Mahomes] — that poker face — we know we’re gonna win this in the end, that permeates positivity. Get back to being positive and not so [grunts] on the sideline with your guys.”\nChiefs Face Bengals in Week 17\nThe Chiefs (9-6) round out 2023 with a matchup against the conference-rival Cincinnati Bengals (8-7) at Arrowhead Stadium. That game will take place on Sunday, December 31 at 3:25 p.m. Central time and can be watched on CBS and ABC.",

    "title": "Professing Faith: Epiphany, what is it and why do you we celebrate it?",
    "text": "With Christmas just ended, let’s not forget that this holiday is not celebrated on one day each year but for 12 as the famous carol “Twelve Days of Christmas” reminds us.\nThe holiday continues until Epiphany, celebrated on Jan. 6. It is one of those holy days which has sadly lost much of its luster in the last century, but is rich in history and tradition.\nIn medieval times, the 12 days after Dec. 25 were notorious for wild partying. The 12th night was particularly riotous, until the long faced Puritans put a stop to that. In some churches it is now forgotten, in some churches this day was kept on the Sunday before Jan. 6, in some places it is kept on Jan. 6 and in the Eastern Orthodox churches it is kept on Jan. 19. But the festival itself goes back a long way.\nThe religious significance of the day is the commemoration of the arrival of the Magi, or the “three kings” who brought gold, frankincense and myrrh, as described in Matthew 2:1-15. The Greek word “magi” is a debated term, but it probably refers to Persian astrologers, possibly from the Zoroastrian noble, or priestly class. But because St. Jerome translated “magoi” into “Regis” or “kings,” for many people kings they have remained. The King James Bible’s translation of the term as “wise men” is hard to beat. Tradition gives their number as three but the Bible makes no such numbering. For all we know there could have been a whole herd of them. And because in Greek, the masculine plural can include both men and women, they may not all have been men at all, which would make sense if it were a tribal group making a visit.\nBut the author of Matthew’s gospel wants to make it clear that he believes that the infant Jesus was manifested to both Jews and to the gentile world from the very moment the Christian story begins. In this sense, the passage should also be considered in the light of the fact that Matthew also describes the infant Jesus visiting African Egypt in his infancy. The point is clear — the holy child is seen as manifested to all nations. St. John Chrysostom remarked that the fact the star briefly stopped shining before the wise men, leading them to consult King Herod for directions, was to remind them and the world that salvation was still from the Jews first, after all.\nThe earliest reference to a Christian celebration on Jan. 6 appears to be in some sermons given around the year 325. The problem is that it is not clear if these sermons are for Christmas or Epiphany, and probably they are for the former. But “Christmas” seems to have been celebrated in some parts of the late Roman Empire in the west on Dec. 25, and in the eastern Empire on Jan. 6. In antiquity, unlike modern churches, there was no common lectionary or calendar of holy days. Both Dec. 25 and Jan. 6 were days on which the ancient authors celebrated not only the Nativity and the arrival of the wise men, but also the baptism of Jesus and the wedding at Cana.\nFrom a theological perspective all these biblical stories make the same point — the Christian savior is revealed to the world. But by the late fifth century AD, Jan. 6 became increasingly fixed for the arrival of the wise men in the west.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox churches, Epiphany is often called Theophany, or “divine manifestation,” and it still calls to mind the Baptism of Christ as well as his manifestation to the pagan magi. Special blessings of water are given on this day, and Theophany water is regarded as more sacred than ordinary holy water. The faithful will take the Theophany water to bless their own homes and property. In some places in the East, the waters of rivers or lakes are blessed and people will immerse themselves in it. In other places the water is generously given out and consumed by the faithful. Several years ago, I visited an Eastern Catholic Church for the blessings of the waters and consumed a fair amount of the stuff since I need all the blessings I can get. At the very least, it did me no harm.\nIn the West, Epiphany customs are more playful. In medieval times, the feast of Epiphany was celebrated by ordinary people with a large party, which was known for its excess and general mayhem. It was in this vein that Shakespeare wrote his famous comedy, “Twelfth Night,” in which Sir Andrew Aguecheek and Toby Belch cause trouble for Lady Olivia. In some Latin American countries, children can leave their shoes with hay stuffed in them for the horse, camel and elephant which bear Los Reyes Magos. One can also polish their shoes for a special attraction and the kings can leave sweets in the shoes. In some places, they very sensibly leave the kings a glass of wine to ensure their good favor. In England to this day, the monarch will visit the Chapel Royal in Windsor on Epiphany and offer gold, frankincense and myrrh at the altar to ask for a blessing on his or her reign. Given that Queen Elizabeth reigned for over 70 years, something seems to have worked.\nFood features prominently in Epiphany customs. In Spain a special bread called “roscon” is made with fruit and sugar and is eaten on this day. In France and French-speaking nations one eats “gateau des Rois,” with a small toy baked inside. Whoever gets the toy is king for the day. In Germany and England, an Epiphany cake is made and a coin is used for the same reason. In my own house, presided over by my English wife, the Christmas decorations do not go down until Epiphany and there is an exchange of the last gift of Christmas and of course the cake. Somehow tea finds its way into the celebrations as well, although I have yet to discover the biblical reason for that.",
