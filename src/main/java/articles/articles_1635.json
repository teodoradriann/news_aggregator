    "text": "Escalating geopolitical tensions are driving the profits of defense companies. Almost after two years, major defense corporations have shifted their stance significantly, with many anticipating robust demand in 2024. According to Reuters, on anticipation of aggressive actions from Russia and China, investments by the United States and its allies in costly weaponry and munitions is on an upsurge.\nOptimistic Market Outlook\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, as quoted on Reuters, shares of the largest defense companies are projected to continue their upward trajectory, beating the broader S&P 500 Index. The Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index and S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index have gained about 14.11% and 25.62%, respectively.\nPer the Reuters article, shares of Lockheed Martin\n[LMT](/market-activity/stocks/lmt), General Dynamics [GD](/market-activity/stocks/gd) and Northrop Grumman [NOC](/market-activity/stocks/noc) are estimated to climb 5-7% over the next 12 months.\nNorthrop Grumman and L3Harris Technologies\n[LHX](/market-activity/stocks/lhx), two primary U.S. rocket manufacturers have both reported an upsurge in demand, with Northrop attributing a significant portion of the rise in demand to the increased need for its rocket motors and warheads which see extensive use in Ukraine.\nRecord U.S. Defense Policy Bill\nOn Dec 22, President Joe Biden signed the U.S. defense policy bill that authorizes a record allowance of $886 billion in military spending, marking an increase of 3% in the nation's total national security budget.\nAccording to Reuters, the Defense bill also includes policies such as aid for Ukraine and push-back against China in the Indo-Pacific region. Such aids, in turn, are expected to usher in order flows for defense contractors, enhancing their potential for generating revenue.\nETFs in Focus\nThe escalating Middle East crisis has resulted in a surge in defense stocks driven by increased demand for military equipment. Persisting tensions between Russia and Ukraine further contribute to the volatility within the geopolitical landscape.\nThe U.S. defense market is valued at $613.18 billion in 2023 and is estimated to witness a CAGR of 0.67%, reaching a valuation of $646.83 billion by 2031, according to Mordor Intelligence.\nAgainst this backdrop, we highlight a few defense ETFs that can gain due to the complicated geopolitical landscape.\niShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA)\niShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF seeks to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index with a basket of 35 securities.

    "title": "Revolutionizing Harare's Infrastructure: Mount Hampden's Access Road Project",
    "text": "In a significant stride towards modernizing infrastructure and easing traffic congestion, the city of Harare embarks on an ambitious project to construct approximately 26 kilometers of access roads. This initiative, centered in the Mount Hampden area, aims to weave a network of roads connecting to the New Parliament Building and various surrounding locales. With a completion deadline set for July 31, 2023, the project promises to transform the vehicular movement and accessibility in the northwest quadrant of the city, heralding a new era of urban development in Zimbabwe.\nA Vision Becomes Concrete\nThe blueprint for this vast infrastructure overhaul includes the rehabilitation and expansion of the Old Mazowe Road starting from the Westgate roundabout, culminating in a sprawling 8-lane boulevard stretching all the way to Bindura Road and leading directly to the New Parliament Building. Additionally, a 13km extension from the roundabout, a picturesque 4.7km crescent encircling the Parliament, and a critical 2km approach road to the parliamentary precinct underscore the project's comprehensive scope. The concerted effort to broaden and enhance these key arteries is not just about facilitating smoother traffic flow; it's a testament to Zimbabwe's commitment to future-proofing its urban landscapes against the challenges of growth and congestion.\nEngineering Progress\nBehind the scenes, a cadre of engineers, planners, and construction workers are the unsung heroes of this transformative endeavor. Government contracts have been awarded to reputable firms, ensuring that the vision for Mount Hampden's road network metamorphoses from plans on paper to asphalt on the ground. The meticulous planning encompasses not just the physical construction but also the strategic alleviation of anticipated bottlenecks, particularly those that could arise from the increased activity around the New Parliament Building. The project's ambitious timeline underscores a relentless push towards completion, with every kilometer of road laid bringing Harare closer to its goal of enhanced navigability and reduced traffic woes.\nThe Road Ahead\nAs the deadline approaches, the anticipation among Harare's residents and commuters grows. The promise of a revamped road network ignites hopes of smoother journeys, less time spent in traffic, and an overall uplift in the quality of urban life. This infrastructure project is more than just an upgrade; it is a significant leap towards realizing Harare's potential as a bustling, efficient, and forward-thinking capital. With the expected completion of the project by July 31, 2023, the eyes of Zimbabwe and beyond are keenly watching as Mount Hampden sets the pace for urban infrastructure development in the 21st century.\nThe narrative of Harare's access road expansion in the Mount Hampden area is a compelling account of vision, commitment, and progress. From the extensive planning phases to the bustling construction sites, each aspect of this project reflects a broader goal of enhancing urban mobility and preparing for the future. As the project nears its completion, it stands as a beacon of development, not just in terms of physical infrastructure but also in the broader context of Zimbabwe's journey towards modernization and growth.",

    "text": "Sugar Bowl weekend events expected to pour $200 million into city of New Orleans Sugar Bowl weekend events expected to pour $200 million into city of New Orleans, boosting tourism and local business sales Sugar Bowl weekend events expected to pour $200 million into city of New Orleans, boosting tourism and local business sales Sugar Bowl weekend events expected to pour $200 million into city of New Orleans, boosting tourism and local business sales It's shaping up to be a winning weekend for the city as we gear up for the 90th anniversary of the Sugar Bowl. Not only are we hosting thousands of University of Washington Huskies and University of Texas Longhorn fans for the New Year's Day game, it'll be a win for New Orleans tourism as well. News Orleans and Company projects the weekend's events to generate roughly $200 million in revenue, giving the city a swift kick into the new year. Hotels, restaurants and bars in New Orleans, specifically in the downtown area are seeing high foot traffic and a boost in sales days ahead of Sunday's parade and Monday's big game. The Texas Longhorns are being hosted by the Marriot Hotel and the Huskies are staying at the Hilton Riverside. Those two hotels, in addition to New Orleans' 26,000 hotels within two miles of the Superdome, are nearly, if not already, sold out. Kelly Schulz with New Orleans and Company says she even believes many of these hotels will be sold out before Sunday and Monday. \"Sugar Bowl weekend is here, the fans are here, and we are ready to welcome everyone,\" Schulz said. \"We are seeing very large crowds coming from both Washington and Texas. The game is sold out, and our hotels are at 95 percent occupancy over the weekend. We are seeing very large crowds that are out shopping, enjoying our restaurants and culture.\" There are also many people who are coming to town and staying with relatives and friends, but also spending their dollars with local bars and restaurants. A game of this magnitude also puts the city in the national spotlight.",

    "text": "/ world today news/ Ukrainian border regions are in a panic. The enterprises were evacuated, the fortifications were erected, the approaches were mined. Constantinople understood the reasons for the Ukrainians’ panic – and found in this equation a trace of the notorious PMC.\nNo one has attacked yet, but everyone has already fled\nThe border Sumy and Kharkiv are buzzing like devastated beehives. Or rather like typical cities in preparation for defense. Local officials and security forces rush to move the archives out and burn anything they don’t have time to move out. Businessmen evacuate businesses in western Ukraine.\nSeveral large city-building enterprises have already been transported to Zapadenshchyna (western regions of Ukraine, note ed.). In particular, they have already “left” the Hartron Aviation Plant, partly the Kharkiv Transport Engineering Plant “V. A. Malyshev” (which produced tanks and trains), the Kharkiv Bearing Plant, “Turboatom”, the Komunar plant (which produced the Neptune missiles). ), FED Engineering Plant, which manufactures aerospace equipment.\nAnd even the factories of the peaceful and non-strategic Kulinichi bread concern went to Galicia, although there are no grain reserves in the Occidental region that would allow it to work successfully on its land.\n“The mayor of Kharkiv, Terekhov, constantly reports on various channels that Kharkiv is an outpost of an independent Ukraine, and many residents of Kharkiv already say that this is not good. The same was said in Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Artemovsk,” says the Adequate Kharkiv resident”, journalist and reserve colonel Gennady Alyokhin, living in Russia, but not losing touch with his small homeland.\nAccording to the blogger, between Kharkiv and Belgorod, the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, together with the territorial defense, are intensively digging trenches, in particular in the Volchan region.\nIn the area of ​​the Slatino and Kazachia Lopan railway stations, the enemy intensively mined the territory with anti-personnel and anti-tank shells.\nThis information was confirmed by the head of the pro-Russian military-civil administration of the Kharkiv region, Vitaly Ganchev. He also said that the Ukrainian authorities are forcing local residents to leave their native land.\n“We know that certain actions are taking place in Kharkiv and the region, which local residents have also informed us about.\nPeople are being driven from their homes, forced to leave the region, and meanwhile the so-called protectors are moving out businesses and whatever they find in the empty houses.”\nThis is what Ganchev said in an interview with TASS.\nA similar picture is also observed in Sumy region, it’s just that Sumy is incomparable in size and industrial potential with the million-strong city of Kharkiv. Because there the process is not so obvious. Chernihiv region does not lag behind its neighbors in the commotion.\nHowever, the evacuation in the border areas of the region began at the end of May this year.\n“Being in one of the settlements, he personally convinced a family of local residents to leave immediately because there was imminent danger,” lied a month later, at the end of June, the commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Sergey Naev, saying that Russia continuously shelling the territories bordering Ukraine.\n“I am currently calling on all citizens who live in the border areas of the Sumy region to leave,” he said at the time.\nAccording to the blogger, between Kharkiv and Belgorod, the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, together with the territorial defense, are intensively digging trenches, in particular in the Volchan region.\nIn the area of ​​the Slatino and Kazachia Lopan railway stations, the enemy intensively mined the territory with anti-personnel and anti-tank shells.\nThis information was confirmed by the head of the pro-Russian military-civil administration of the Kharkiv region, Vitaly Ganchev. He also said that the Ukrainian authorities would have to return\nWe remind you: the Russian army has already entered the territory of Sumy and Kharkiv regions. But the first, along with Chernigov and Kiev, she left after the Istanbul Agreement, as a result of which Russia was deceived and misled. And the second area – after the known regrouping.\nBut we have to get back there. After all, after the withdrawal from these territories, we laid bare our borders – Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions. And the enemy did not fail to take advantage of this.\nIt is no coincidence that during a recent meeting with military commanders, President Vladimir Putin spoke about the need to create a sanitary zone.\n“And if this continues, then we must, obviously, consider the issue of creating some sanitary zone on the territory of Ukraine at such a distance from which it would be impossible to reach our territory,” the Russian president warned.\nExperienced nurses\nBy the way, immediately after the regrouping of our army from the Kharkiv and Sumy regions, Yevgeny Prigozhin took up the creation and training of fighters for the territorial self-defense of the Belgorod and Kursk regions. On his account, he claimed.\nIn those days they were afraid to give arms to the new militias. But in the border areas, the open terror of puppet collaborators from the so-called Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) began. And the bloody orgy of shelling of the armed forces of Ukraine.\nNoticing this, Prigozhin threatened to bring PMC Wagner there and settle the matter like an adult. In particular, he gave the Ministry of Defense two weeks to resolve the issue.\n“If this does not happen and if the situation worsens, then we will go to Belgorod. And we will defend our land,” he declared.\n“But we will insist that Frunzenskaya (headquarters of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow. – Ed.) also move to Belgorod. If I die, then it will all be together,” said PMC head Wagner.\nAs is known, the “Ahmat” special forces subsequently advanced to the border territories, and the bandits from the RDK* suddenly stopped their raids. But not the shelling of Russian soil. And the issue of creating a sanitary zone is still acute.\nPreparing for a concert?\nAccording to “TsarigraD” sources, even before Prigozhin’s “shooting riot”, a group of “musicians” arrived in the Belgorod region. And not the weakest. Maybe for reinforcement. Or research?\n“We are resting and preparing. On June 5 we left, on August 5, according to forecasts, PMC “Wagner” in full combat readiness will be able to perform the assigned combat tasks”, I remember that the head of the “Orchestra” shared his plans even before the start of the commotion .\nWe have already assumed that the northwestern direction, which had to be abandoned by the Russian army in 2022, could become the new tasks of the PMC.\nWe also analyzed why it is easier for “musicians” to enter from the territory of Belarus not directly, through swamps and minefields, namely through the region of Chernigov or Kharkiv with the prospect of moving to Sumy and Poltava.\nIf we assume this, then we should not assume that something similar was not calculated in the headquarters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n“I do not rule out that these Wagnerites who went to Belarus appear in the same Sumy. I do not deny the possibility that Prigozhin is now sitting and signing contracts for new military operations,” military expert, retired colonel Anatoly Matviychuk, shared his opinion with Tsarigrad.\n“Obviously, a sanitary cordon will be created around Ukraine, which will remain after the end of this conflict,” he also said.\nWhat follows from this?\nThe fact that the situation at the borders, on the one hand, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and on the other – Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk regions, cannot remain the same is obvious. Because every day there are shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, houses are burning, there are people killed and wounded.\nAnd also because Russian people live here and there, divided according to the whims of various political adventurers. These people need a peaceful and secure life. And for the entire Russian people – historical justice.\nBut even with a high degree of certainty, we can only guess how events will develop further. Therefore, there is only one thing left – to wait for August.\n* The Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) is a terrorist organization banned in Russia.\nTranslation: SM\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for the channel in Telegram:\nShare on your profiles, with friends, in groups and on pages.

    "text": "Elders under the auspices of the Rivers Leaders Forum (RLF) have faulted the allegation of the state governor, Siminialayi Fubara, that a purported dynamite’s explosion close to the Hotel Presidential in Port Harcourt was designed to entrench the call for a state of emergency in Rivers.\nThe leaders said the governor lied describing his position as “misinformation” and “deliberate efforts” to undermine the state’s peace and security.\nThe leaders explained that a peaceful march was held in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area in solidarity with a former Governor and Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, Nyesom Wike and to express gratitude to the police for maintaining peace despite provocative actions by the governor.\nReading the position of the elders, Senator Olaka Nwogu, said the designated route of the march in Obio-Akpo had nothing to do with the location of the Presidential Hotel.\nNwogu said: These allegations, once again, are consistent with a pattern of misinformation and deliberate efforts of H.E. Sim Fubara to undermine the peace and security of the state under his watch.\n“First, and for records, the people of Obio/Akpor local government area undertook a peace match beginning from Rumueme Civic Centre along Ikwerre Road and ending at Peoples Club along Rumuola Road.\n“This is a route that did not include the Hotel Presidential, to show solidarity with the most successful Governor Rivers State ever had, now Minister of FCT, H.E. Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, and to express faith in his reserved conduct despite his being betrayed, maligned, misrepresented and daily insulted by Governor Sim Fubara and his supporters.\n“The people of Obio/Akpor also expressed gratitude to the police for keeping the peace despite provocative actions of the governor in illegally inaugurating Caretaker Committees for the local government councils contrary to the law; a situation that has stirred up much public disaffection and threat to peace.\n“To be clear on the matter of the explosion at Hotel Presidential, there was no incident at the hotel associated with the Peace march as the routes for the march are completely different from the location of Hotel Presidential.\n“It’s only the governor and Rivers State Government that knew that there were Senators (guests) in Rivers State and we believe he and his team went ahead and planted a fake explosive detonator to act drama in other to cry wolf.\n“Is the governor or His Commissioner for Health the police detectives or any other security agent that they are the only people who heard an explosion and also arrested the so-called culprit at Rivers State Government-owned hospital? Please let the Police do their job.”\nNwogu added: “It is a common knowledge that at the spurious allegation that the State Assembly was to impeach the governor, the Assembly Complex was bombed and now to be rebuilt at an exorbitant cost of N19bn against an estimate of N9bn from the Rivers State Ministry of Works.\n“The same style he adopted when Assembly was bombed. He accused Wike and quickly claimed the state was investigating and would arrest and prosecute the culprits. Till today have any of you heard anything about the report of the bombing of the Rivers State House of Assembly Complex?\n“Governor Sim Fubara said ‘he is not fighting anybody’ yet he told the world that ‘Jungle has matured’. We are aware that the governor plays the victim when in fact he is the aggressor manipulating everybody to his bidding and blaming others for the failed outcomes”.\nAnother leader and former Chief of Staff, Chukwuemeka Woke wondered when a peaceful protest had become a call for a state of emergency recalling that since October 2023 till date, the governor had been sponsoring over 100 protests in the state.\nHe said: “On the 12th of December, 2023 a coalition of youths of Ijaw ethnic nationalities embarked on a solidary visit to Governor Sim. On December 17, 2023, the members representing Akuku-Toru/Asari-Toru and Andoni Federal Constituencies led a protest for Governor Sim\n“On December 23, 2023, Group Concern Youths stormed Government House urging the governor to discontinue the Presidential Peace Proclamation. On the 22nd of February, 2024 some group of women under simplified Rivers women for Sim matched the streets of Port Harcourt for Governor Sim.\n“On the 3rd of April, 2024, another group from NULGE extraction was in Government House we can go on and on.\n“Further on the local government imbroglio, the Governor needed only three months to call for elections to forestall the current tension in the state. He has been in the office for over a year.\n“The President directed that elections be conducted by forbidding the use of Caretaker Committees in his eight-point Peace Plan, yet Governor Sim preferred to cause mayhem by setting up these Caretaker Committees with the support of non-state actors despite the President Peace Plan, despite the Court of Appeal, despite the Constitution, now he is afraid of State of Emergency.\n“He should realize that his office is a creation of law and only adherence and obedience to Law can keep his office. They insisted that the march did not involve a failed attempt to blow up Hotel Presidential, as alleged by the governor”.",

Our economy not only did not fall but grew at a pace that no one expected.\" Ukraine is trying to maintain economic stability as uncertainty around funding from Western donors has proven to be a critical long-term challenge while the country endures Russian strikes on key infrastructure. Expenditures on military operations are counted in GDP figures and may provide a short-term spending boost. Earlier in December, Ukraine agreed with creditors from the G7 and the Paris Club to extend debt restructuring to 2027. President Zelensky in Kyiv on Dec. 19 told reporters he plans to reduce government expenditures because significant funding will be needed for fresh mobilization efforts. Ukraine risks a serious economic downturn in 2024 unless its Western supporters can muster enough funds to fill a massive hole in its budget, Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko told Politico in November.",
