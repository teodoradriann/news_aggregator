    "text": "Many house fires today, burn faster, hotter, and are deadlier than ever. That’s because many newer homes have open floor plans with fewer walls and doors, allowing the fire to travel faster and more freely. Another factor is that many homes have furnishings made with synthetic materials, like plastic or particleboard, which burn much quicker than say, solid wood, so getting an early fire warning and then getting out is more important than ever. The National Fire Protection Association advises that we should: - Install an alarm on each floor - Test the alarms once a month - Replace alarms after 10 years Consumer Reports' exclusive smoke detector ratings are free, so if you're not sure what to buy they may be a good place to start. The SimpliSafe SSSD3 dual-sensor smoke detector received top scores for detecting both flaming and smoldering fires. It’s battery-operated, which means you won’t need a professional to hard-wire it. It can also be interconnected so if one alarm sounds off, the others will follow. The battery-powered Kidde i9070 smoke detector also received top scores for detecting both flaming and smoldering fires. The Siterwell GS526A smoke detector from Walmart is another good option and comes with a ten-year battery.",

Insider Says…\nAnd we’re not the only ones! TayTay herself is riding high in the relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. And doing it very publicly! On Thursday morning, a source spoke to Us Weekly about her comfort being out and about with the podcast host. The insider revealed Travis’ powerful physical presence and his fun, lighthearted persona have combined to give the Tortured Poets Department crooner the security blanket she has desperately needed for so long!! The source explained:\n“[It’s] been so refreshing for Taylor not to feel the need to hide with Travis.

Being yourself and letting it all out while having the peace of mind in knowing your partner has your back ! We love that!\nReal-world evidence would seem to confirm that, too. For one, this duo loves to hide out and lay low together.

A decisão se deu em meio às investigações do uso de drones pela seleção feminina do Canadá para espionagem . A entidade descobriu que a prática é anterior aos Jogos Olímpicos e aconteceu em outras competições .\nO auxiliar técnico Andy Spence vai comandar o Canadá no torneio do futebol feminino olímpico. Bev havia se retirado da estreia, nesta quinta-feira, quando a seleção canadense venceu a Nova Zelândia por 2 a 1 . No entanto, horas depois do jogo, a federação comunicou que Priestman ficará fora de toda a competição.\n+ Veja a tabela do futebol feminino nas Olimpíadas\n+ Canadá manda duas profissionais para casa após espionagem\n1 de 1 Técnica Bev Priestman está suspensa pelo Canadá nas Olimpíadas — Foto: Logan Riely/Getty Images Técnica Bev Priestman está suspensa pelo Canadá nas Olimpíadas — Foto: Logan Riely/Getty Images\nNesta quinta, uma reportagem da emissora TSN , do Canadá, revelou que a prática de espionagem foi registrada nas seleções masculina e feminina do país em competições nos últimos anos. Há registros, inclusive, das Olimpíadas de Tóquio, quando o time feminino canadense foi medalha de ouro e eliminou o Brasil nas quartas de final.\nNo comunicado, o diretor da Federação Canadense, Kevin Blue, informou que as investigações revelaram um uso anterior de drones para espionagem de rivais nas seleções.\n– Nas últimas 24 horas, informações adicionais chegaram ao nosso conhecimento sobre o uso anterior de drones contra oponentes, antes dos Jogos Olímpicos de Paris 2024 – diz Blue.\n– À luz dessas novas revelações, o Canada Soccer tomou a decisão de suspender a técnica da seleção feminina de futebol nacional, Bev Priestman, pelo restante dos Jogos Olímpicos de Paris 2024 e até a conclusão de nossa revisão externa independente recentemente anunciada – disse o CEO da Federação Canadense, Kevin Blue.\nEntenda a polêmica\nNo início da semana, o Comitê Olímpico da Nova Zelândia havia denunciado à polícia francesa que um drone foi visto sobrevoando o local dos treinamentos de sua seleção feminina de futebol. Em seguida um membro da comissão técnica do Canadá foi identificado como o operador do aparelho . O comitê neozelandês fez uma queixa formal ao COI (Comitê Olímpico Internacional) e solicitou providências.\nNa quarta-feira, a seleção feminina canadense dispensou duas profissionais, que chegaram a ser detidas pela polícia local. O Comitê Olímpico do país anunciou que mandou embora para casa a analista Joseph Lombardi, que operou o drone, e a assistente Jasmine Mander, a quem ela se reportava. Lombardi seria uma \"analista não-credenciada\".\nO Comitê Olímpico Canadense pediu desculpas pelo incidente. Em nota, a Fifa também emitiu um comunicado no qual diz que abriu um processo disciplinar contra o Canadá e os profissionais envolvidos.",

    "text": "In the district of Döşemealtı in Türkiye's\nAntalya province, the end of the harvest season brings a flurry of activity across hundreds of acres of agricultural land.\nIn spring, women labor for days harvesting agricultural produce, while in summer, they toil to ensure that carpets and rugs, left out in the sun, fade to pastel hues and are later cleaned.\nThese hardworking women also play a pivotal role in the visual spectacle created as valuable carpets and rugs grace the fields.\nEmployed seasonally by carpet companies, these women meticulously lay out carpets in 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) heat daily, contributing to their family's economy.\nThey diligently correct any carpets blown or curled by the wind and periodically rid them of dust amid challenging terrain notorious for constant dust due to wind.\nOn days when rain is forecasted, these women swiftly gather and store carpets in covered areas, only to spread them out again after the rain subsides.\nTheir daily dedication ensures that these carpets, transformed into pastels through their meticulous effort, are harvested starting in September and shipped to overseas markets.\nAyşe Akbaba, the field supervisor at a carpet trading company in the Killik neighborhood, shared with Anadolu Agency (AA) that they worked in the carpet fields for three months.\n\"Our workday in the 'carpet field' starts at 8 a.m.,\" Akbaba said, noting that 80% of the workforce comprises women from surrounding villages striving to support their families. \"They handle carpets with a woman's touch.\"\nWorker Döndü Özmen mentioned rotating the direction of carpets daily and highlighted challenges due to hot weather. \"I sometimes marvel at carpets I've worked on, especially Döşemealtı carpets and kilims,\" she added.\nHuriye Okçu expressed delight in working in the carpet fields, emphasizing, \"Working here contributes to my household economy. I am happy working here.\"\nHigh school student Sena Orman described spreading washed carpets in fields with her fellow student friends. \"During winter, I study at school. During summer, I earn my pocket money here. My dream is to excel in university and have a good career,\" she shared.",

Photo by U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Washington Mary Ann Bliesner, 83, the former president and primary owner of the now-closed Valley Processing Inc., a fruit juice manufacturer in Sunnyside, Washington, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Washington announced today.\nBliesner also admitted to failing to correct VPI’s introduction of adulterated grape juice concentrate into interstate commerce, including product delivered to a customer for use in the National School Lunch Program, the office said.\n“Bliesner and her company, Valley Processing, produced juice in filthy and unsafe conditions, mislabeled that product, and then sold it to the National School Lunch Program that serves low-income schoolchildren,” said U.S. Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref for the Eastern District of Washington.\n“Schoolchildren deserve safe and nutritious food. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our children.”\nAccording to the department, during a May 2018 U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspection (FDA), VPI employees placed caution tape over the entrance to the room with the vats and told investigators it was unsafe to enter and contained no juice products.\nFDA investigators later discovered the vats and found grape juice concentrate contaminated with bird and rodent feces, fur, insects, decaying animal remains, mold, yeast, and other contaminants, the department said.\nVPI admitted it blended grape juice concentrate that had been stored outside the facility for years and exposed to the elements with newer concentrate. The resulting product was sold to customers as if it were new, the department said.\nEx-Valley Processing president admits to selling adulterated juice, including to the National School Lunch Program, per DOJ. Photo by U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Washington “Protecting the safety of America’s food supply is essential,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.\n“The Department of Justice will take action whenever appropriate to ensure individuals and companies that produce our food maintain safe facilities and tell the truth to their customers and the FDA.”\n109",
