    "text": "Il sangue sulla statua piangente della Madonna di Trevignano appartiene a Gisella Cardia. Sì, la veggente che sosteneva che la lacrimazione fosse vera e che, anche dopo la richiesta di stop alle celebrazioni religiose che attiravano decine di persone in riva al lago, continuava a incontrare i fedeli. La notizia - riporta il Corriere della Sera - arriva dai risultati delle indagini nei laboratori di Tor Vergata, che hanno confermato che il sangue appartiene alla \"santona\". Che ora rischia il rinvio a giudizio. Il suo avvocato spiega: «Aspettiamo di conoscere se si tratta di profilo misto o singolo. Lei ha maneggiato e baciato la statua».\nLe indagini sulla Madonna di Trevignano\nDalle indagini erano già emerse degli indizi sul sangue di origine umana e non animale della statua.\nL'avvocato di Gisella Cardia, Solange Marchignoli, ha risposto al Corriere: «Aspettiamo di conoscere se si tratta di profilo misto o singolo: se il profilo è singolo significa che è solo di Cardia e lo ha messo lei, quindi in questo caso si andrebbe a giudizio, ma se come ci si aspetta il profilo è misto vuol dire che il Dna trovato sulla statua contiene anche e non solo Dna di Gisella, cosa che noi ci aspettiamo perché lei ha utilizzato la statuetta, l'ha baciata e maneggiata. Chi lo può dire, chi conosce il Dna della Madonna? Qualcuno sa dirci? Io non ho risposte. Deduco non sia umano ma questo è un nostro pensiero: ci addentriamo nella fede? Io voglio escludere che non sia solo sangue di Gisella».",

    "title": "12 Best Bronzers If You’re Not Into Blush",
    "text": "I am a bronzer girl. Ever since I was handed my first NARS bronzer many moons ago, I knew that bronzers were my go-to multipurpose beauty product.\nDon’t get me wrong: I love a good blush moment , but it took me a very long time to find that perfect shade of not-too-bright berry red — whereas I can always count on a bronzer, no matter the shade, to warm up and shape my face, give me that sun-kissed glow , and highlight my cheekbones .\nOver the years, I’ve tested powders, creams, and liquid bronzers on the hottest days, on my busiest days, and of course, the coldest and gloomiest days when you need it the most. I’ve even used it as an eye shadow!\nMy research is in and I’ve rounded up the best bronzers, whether you want a warm or dewy or even a matte finish. And while it looks like I’m only wearing one bronzer, I can assure you I am wearing different ones and I have the half-used bottle of micellar water to prove it.\n.\nOur Top Picks: The Best for a Dewy Glow\nSaie Beauty Sun Melt $32 $32 Saie’s balm bronzer quickly became a favorite, and for good reason. Not only does it have a decent color range, offering four shades for light to dark skin tones, but the balm formula is easy to apply and gives you a radiant glow on top of your newly bronzed skin. If you prefer a dewier finish and layering on cream products, then this is the one for you. If you have oily skin, skip it.\n$32 at Sephora Buy $32 at Saie Buy The Best Non-Bronzer Bronzer\nMakeup by Mario Transforming Skin Perfector $34 $34 While Makeup by Mario’s bronzer is a great option I love to recommend the brand’s Softsculpt Perfector which is more of a multi-tasker that can also bronze, highlight, and add radiance Just make sure you grab the right shade and keep it light.\n$34 at Sephora Buy The Best for a Velvet Finish\nHaus Labs by Lady Gaga Power Sculpt Velvet Bronzer $38 $38 With a velvety matte finish, this bronzer also stays true to its name. It’s very subtle in terms of coverage, making it foolproof for even the most novice bronzer user.\n$38 at Sephora Buy $38 at Haus Laboratories Buy The Easiest Bronzer to Use\nMerit Bronze Balm Sheer Sculpting Bronzer $30 $30 One of the perks of Merit’s products is that they’re multipurpose. This one is no exception. The sculpting bronzer blends out easily whether it’s with whatever brush you own or your fingers. It goes on sheer so you can build it up without overdoing it. One thing I find with “no-makeup-makeup” products is sometimes they don’t always play well with heavier-coverage products like foundation, but this one is easy to work with without lifting or removing your product. I also like to pair it with the brand’s Flush Balm and concealer.\n$30 at Sephora Buy The Best Duo\nPatrick Ta Major Sculpt Crème Contour & Powder Bronzer Duo $40 $40 Patrick Ta’s cream-and-powder duo is one of the brand’s top products. One side is a cream contour that’s warm or cool depending on the shade you grab, and the other is a light, buildable powder. It takes a little work to build up the powder, but I like to use a fluffy dense brush to apply it and tap a light layer of the cream contour over.\n$40 at Sephora Buy .\nMore tried-and-true options: The Best for No-Makeup Makeup\nGlossier Solar Paint $20 $20 If you loved Glossier’s Cloud Paint but always wanted the packaging to include some type of applicator, Glossier finally gave us what we always wanted with its Solar Paint. Similar to the cult-favorite Cloud Paint — though, a little product goes a long way. The cream bronzer is easy to blend and gives you a warm and natural glow. It does dry out quickly, so you have to work fast and blend immediately.\n$20 at Glossier Buy The Best for a Healthy Glow\nGuerlain Terracotta Light Healthy Glow Bronzer $59 $59 The name of this bronzer says it all. If you’re willing to spend a little more, this is indeed the best bronzer for a healthy glow. The bits of pink and shimmer blend into a radiant shade when you swirl your brush, making it have enough of a pinkish undertone to double as blush. Fun fact: I used mine for an embarrassingly long time before hitting the pan, so keep that in mind when considering the price.\n$59 at Nordstrom Buy $59 at Sephora Buy The Best for an Allover Glow\nCharlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Sun-Kissed Glow Cream Bronzer $56 $56 A bronzer that also has skin-care benefits? I was intrigued. This cream bronzer contains hyaluronic acid for hydrating and smoothing skin while also giving that coveted healthy bronze to your face and body. I like to use a very light hand when picking up the product with a brush and applying it.\n$56 at Nordstrom Buy $56 at Sephora Buy The Best Blurring Bronzer\nRose Inc Solar Infusion Moisturizing Cream Bronzer $36 $36 For a cream bronzer, this is fairly easy to apply. It does have a matte finish, but it doesn’t feel dry. I like to use a fluffy brush to sheer out the light coverage.\n$36 at Sephora Buy $36 at Rose Inc Buy The Cult Favorite\nNARS Bronzer Powder $24 $31 now 23% off $24 For a while, I had been convinced that I could not use bronzers since many of them were almost my exact skin color — until a NARS sales associate handed me the bronzer powder in Casino, that is. NARS is a favorite for its color range and, obviously, how well it works. And if excess shimmer isn’t your thing, there’s also a matte version that blends just as well.\n$24 at Amazon Buy $40 at Sephora Buy The Best Multipurpose\nTower 28 Beauty Bronzino Illuminating Cream Bronzer $20 $20 I’d consider most bronzers multipurpose, but this cream formula is definitely the best for multiple uses. I find it’s best applied with your fingers to really warm the product up and blend it seamlessly to the high points of your face to bronze and highlight. I use West Coast, a neutral-medium bronze, as a highlighter and Best Coast as a bronzer and eye shadow.\n$20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Sephora Buy The Best Color Range\nAnastasia Beverly Hills Cream Bronzer $35 $35 This bronzer has range. Color range, that is. With ten shades available, the formula blends perfectly and gives you a natural finish — or if you want to contour, there’s a shade for that, too.\n$35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Nordstrom Buy",

    "text": "El intento de golpe de estado en Bolivia reflota al presidente Arce (pero alimenta conspiraciones)\nLa población boliviana se divide entre quien refuerza el apoyo al mandatario y quien le acusa de montar un espectáculo mediático\nBuenos AiresDespués de una tarde de tensión en el centro de La Paz, cuando varias guerrillas militares ocuparon la plaza Murillo y entraron de forma violenta en la sede del gobierno de Bolivia\nen un intento de golpe de estado que rápidamente se disolvió, el presidente Luis Arce ha sido objeto tanto de alabanzas como de críticas por parte de sus conciudadanos. Mientras que el miércoles por la noche, hora local, cientos de personas se agolpaban ante el Palacio de Gobierno para aclamar al presidente y apoyarlo, sectores críticos con Arce han continuado alimentando, sin pruebas, la teoría de un montaje y show mediático : \"Hay muchas cosas que no cuadran\", apunta William Flores, periodista boliviano, en conversación con el ARA: \"En primer lugar, un golpe de estado no dura dos horas\". El ex comandante del ejército, Juan José Zúñiga, líder de la sublevación, dijo al ser detenido que el golpe había sido ordenado por el propio Arce en un intento de mejorar su imagen pública.\nY es que el liderazgo de Arce es cuestionado por una parte de la población boliviana, sobre todo en relación con la gestión económica del país: Bolivia registra una escasez importante de dólares, lo que ha perjudicado el acceso de entradas o bienes de importación, cuyo precio, además, ha aumentado. Aparte, el propio Arce ha reconocido que la situación de los hidrocarburos es crítica: Bolivia ha pasado de ser un país exportador neto de energía a tener que importarla y, con falta de divisas, la compra se complica aún más. “¿Cómo es que el presidente se enfrenta cara a cara con el militar que supuestamente estaría generando un golpe?”, se pregunta Flores: “Todo el mundo sabe que en una situación así el presidente es el primer objetivo en capturar y, por tanto, es lo primero que debe tener cuidado y protección. En cambio, Arce salió como un superhéroe para demostrar al pueblo que no tiene miedo”.\nFlores hace referencia a una escena que pasará a la posteridad. Arce encaró al general Zúñiga cuando éste ocupó con carros de asalto y soldados la plaza Murillo de La Paz, el núcleo político del país. El presidente, abiertamente enojado, le gritó: “¡Cuidado extiende haciendo un golpe contra el pueblo boliviano! ¡No te lo voy a permitir! Si usted se respeta como militar, repliegue todas sus fuerzas. ¡Es una orden!” Las imágenes de la discusión, que favorecen al mandatario, se han hecho virales. Detrás de Arce también llamaba a María Nela Prada, su mano derecha y ministra de la Presidencia, que decía: \"Traicionero!\" Poco después, la ministra Prada quiso subrayar la valentía del presidente Arce, que se encaró directamente a los militares. \"La decisión del presidente fue quedarse y hacer frente a Zúñiga\", apuntó. A muchos les sorprende que les militares sublevados no aprovecharan este enfrentamiento para detener a las principales autoridades del país o, directamente, matarlas.\nEste jueves La Paz ha despertado con total normalidad, a excepción de un refuerzo de vigilancia policial en la plaza Murillo. Flores reconoce que el miércoles hubo un rato de \"psicosis\", donde en medio de la confusión la gente salió a comprar bienes de primera necesidad para almacenar en casa, pero que enseguida todo se calmó. Todos los aeropuertos del país cerraron, por decisión de las autoridades civiles.\nDonde sí ha habido movimiento este jueves ha estado en la vecina ciudad de El Alto, distrito clave del oficialismo. Grupos de manifestantes salieron a las calles y quemaron neumáticos y descargaron camiones de arena, piedras y troncos para cortar las vías de circulación hacia La Paz. Además, varias organizaciones sociales y sindicatos se declararon en huelga indefinida y movilización permanente. Otras ciudades del país, como Cochabamba, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Oruro o Potosí, no se han hecho prácticamente eco de las movilizaciones.\nElecciones en el horizonte\nEl tiempo dirá si el intento de levantamiento militar acaba reforzando el poder de Arce, que, al menos y de momento, sale reflotado. No hay que olvidar que, de telón de fondo, planea el conflicto interno sobre el partido oficialista Movimiento en el Socialismo (MAS), entre el actual presidente Luis Arce y el expresidente Evo Morales. El golpe de estado del 2019 obligó a Evo al exilio tras tres mandatos en el poder, y en el 2020 su sucesor Arce ganó las elecciones, pero al devolver Evo a Bolivia la distancia entre ambos líderes se fue ensanchando: actualmente se disputan la candidatura a las elecciones presidenciales de 2025, a las que supuestamente Evo no podría concurrir.\nLas facciones “evistas” del MAS han alimentado la teoría de un autogolpe que serviría para victimizar a Arce y perjudicar a Evo. “Creo que Evo puede salir más perjudicado que beneficiado de este episodio –calcula Flores–, e incluso puede acusarse de haber gestado él mismo el alzamiento con los militares”.",

    "text": "Though the weather outside may be frightful, the wrestling quad at Tri-Center was so delightful for Riverside, who went 3-0 at Thursday's wrestling quad.\nRiverside finished on top of the rest of the crew, going 3-0 through the quad as they beat ACGC in their first duel 42-37, dominated Western Iowa Conference foe Tri-Center 61-12, then capped off the evening with a 61-17 victory over Woodbine.\n\"The kids wrestled very well, I was very happy with how we came out and fought,\" Bulldogs coach Casey Conover said. \"We still have some kids battling some injuries so it was especially great to see some of the younger kids step up and wrestle well. This month is going to be a grind. We still need to get better physically and mentally. We just need to keep working on the small things, and we'll keep getting better.\"\nRiverside’s Kingston Carrigan (106), Davis Bramman (113), Jack Branan (138), Jaxon Gordon (144), Taven Moore (150), Jett Rose (157), and A.C. Roller (165) were all winners for Riverside against ACGC.\nPeople are also reading…\nCarrigan, Bramman, Kellen Oliver (120), Bradyn Comstock (126), Jack Branan (132), Gordon, Moore, Rose, Roller, Gaven Hackett (175), and Jackson Allen (190) were all winners against Tri-Center.\nRose, Moore, Roller, Hackett, Allen, Carrington, Bramman, Oliver, Branan, Rex Shanno (138), and Gordon all earned victories against Woodbine.\nRose, who was one of the six Bulldog wrestlers who went 3-0 on the evening, was especially pleased to have a solid night after battling an injury to start the season, and now looks to build momentum as sectionals and districts draw closer.\n\"Starting the season off injured is always tough, but it just feels good to be back on the mat,\" Rose said. \"The coaches have been talking to us about how January is going to be a grind, but we're looking forward to it. Hopefully, it will help us out in February, I want to get past the sectionals this time and make my way to state.\"\nTri-Center went 1-2 in the evening as they won by a tie-breaker over Woodbine 37-36 in their first duel, then fell to Riverside in their second duel, and then lost 59-17 to ACGC.\nTucker Olsen (106), Gryphen McDermott (120), Noah Goodwin (132), Brant Freeberg (138), Titus Humbert (144), Charlie Morse (190), and Athan Chessmore (215) were the victors for TC in the win over Woodbine.\nFreeberg was one of two Trojans to go 3-0 on the night after pinning two opponents and winning by a major decision in his third match. Freeberg looks to battle through his junior year, hoping it will lead to a second straight trip to state soon.\n\"All three were good matches and I just worked on everything I knew how to do and polish myself,\" Freeberg said. \"Got the pin in those first two matches, but the final kid was really solid and didn't let himself get turned, so I just had to pile up the points. We have a few more duels, so I'm hoping to get more duel wins and get back to the Wells Fargo Arena.\"\nFreeberg and Chessmore collected the only two victories against Riverside.\nChessmore also went 3-0 for TC and has some big goals of his own. After pinning all three of his opponents in this quad, he looks to ride this momentum in the upcoming meets and hopes to join some of his teammates in Des Moines later.\n\"All three guys were pretty tough, but I just kept working positions and moves to get the pins,\" Chessmore said. \"I've been working on a lot of different things, trying to improve myself to be the best come districts. Hopefully, that results in a lot more wins and a trip to state.\"\nAlong with Freeberg and Chessmore, Tucker Olsen (106) got a win in the ACGC duel.\nWoodbine went 0-3 at this quad, and ACGC went 2-1 on the night.\nTri-Center will wrestle again on Saturday at the Griswold Tournament starting at 10 a.m. Riverside will wrestle again on Tuesday in a triangular at Underwood starting at 5:30 p.m.",

    "text": "Gewerkschaft verkündet Tarifeinigung bei Dönerfabrik Birtat\nMehrere Tage ist bei der schwäbischen Dönerfabrik Birtat für bessere Bezahlung und einen Tarifvertrag gekämpft worden. Nun gibt es eine Einigung. Wie sieht sie aus?\nMurr - Im Tarifkonflikt beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat gibt es eine Einigung - es ist zugleich nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: „Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.“\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert. dpa",
