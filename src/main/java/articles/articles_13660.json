    "text": "28/12/2023 - 19:19\nA Justiça chilena aumentou nesta quinta-feira (28) as condenações de nove militares da reserva por sua participação no assassinato de 15 pessoas durante o caso chamado de “Caravana da Morte”, nas primeiras semanas da ditadura de Augusto Pinochet.\nO brigadeiro Pedro Espinoza e o coronel Juan Chiminelli, os dois militares da reserva que haviam sido condenados a cinco anos de prisão em 2018 como autores dos homicídios, agora deverão cumprir uma pena de 15 anos, segundo a decisão da Suprema Corte, o máximo tribunal do país.\nOutros seis militares receberam condenações entre cinco e 10 anos por sua participação nos crimes, ocorridos na cidade de La Serena, a cerca de 500 km de Santiago.\nO general reformado Juan Emilio Cheyre, que, em 2003, foi o primeiro comandante em chefe do Exército a pedir um “nunca mais” para abusos dos direitos humanos, foi condenado a cinco anos por sua cumplicidade no caso, mas ele recebeu o benefício da liberdade vigiada.\nA Caravana da Morte é um dos casos mais emblemáticos dos crimes cometidos durante a ditadura de Pinochet (1973-1990), que deixou mais de 3.200 mortos.\nDias depois do golpe de Estado de 11 de setembro de 1973 que depôs o governo do socialista Salvador Allende (1970-1973) e instaurou a ditadura de Pinochet, uma comitiva militar liderada pelo general Sergio Arellano percorreu de helicóptero várias cidades do país para executar partidários de Allende que haviam sido presos.\nSegundo a decisão judicial, Pinochet ordenou “percorrer diversas cidades do país, para acelerar os processos que afetavam os presos políticos e (…) avançar com sua execução”.\nNesse contexto, as 15 vítimas de La Serena foram levadas a um polígono de tiro, onde foram “executadas sem julgamento prévio, mediante disparos efetuados pelo pessoal do Exército, alguns deles mortos com um tiro de graça”, diz o tribunal.\nA Suprema Corte ordenou à Receita Federal a pagar uma reparação de cerca de 3,6 milhões de dólares (17,4 milhões de reais) a 32 familiares das vítimas.\nPinochet, que faleceu em 2006, foi processado e ficou sob prisão domiciliar por esse caso, o primeiro pelo qual teve que comparecer ante a Justiça chilena.\nMas, em julho de 2002, foi exonerado pelo Supremo Tribunal por uma alegada demência que o impedia de se defender em tribunal.\nA decisão desta quinta-feira é uma das várias condenações definitivas emitidas neste ano pela Justiça chilena por crimes cometidos durante a ditadura, quando o golpe de Estado completou 50 anos.\naxl/ps/dga/dd/ic",

    "text": "El expresidente de la Generalitat Carles Puigdemont ha celebrado este viernes el regreso a Cataluña de la secretaria general de ERC, Marta Rovira: \"Con el retorno de los exiliados perseguidos por la gran farsa judicial que ha sido el caso Tsunami se acaba una injusticia\". Marta Rovira ha entrado ya en Cataluña desde la frontera francesa que da acceso a La Jonquera (Girona) tras más de seis años residiendo en Suiza huida de la justicia española por el procés, así como el diputado Rubén Wagensberg; el vicepresidente primero de Òmnium Cultural, Oleguer Serra; el empresario Josep Campmajó y el periodista Jesús Rodríguez. \"Con exiliados, encarcelados y perseguidos no se puede hacer política en igualdad de condiciones. Esto afecta a la democracia, y mientras dure la represión política no existirá ninguna normalidad posible\", ha añadido Puigdemont en X. El expresidente de la Generalitat, que se encuentra en Bruselas (Bélgica) desde otoño de 2017, todavía no puede regresar a Cataluña con garantías de no ser detenido después de que el Tribunal Supremo haya decidido no aplicarle la ley de amnistía, si bien ha asegurado que estará presente en el primer debate de investidura que se celebre en el Parlament. A pesar del regreso de Rovira, Puigdemont considera que el independentismo todavía está \"lejos\" de tener \"las condiciones que permitan hacer política con normalidad\". \"Que de alguna manera podáis recuperar los años y los meses que os han robado, y que nos pongamos a trabajar lo más rápido posible. Porque hay mucho trabajo pendiente\", ha expresado. Envía tu noticia a: [participa@andaluciainformacion.es](mailto:participa@andaluciainformacion.es)",

    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Michael Holtz is a survivor of colorectal cancer , a diagnosis he received more than a decade ago while training to run a marathon. He's been cancer-free since 2013 and spent the last eight days jet-setting from Arizona to Washington D.C., to spread his message about taking preventative measures against the illness. \"My surgeon liked to let me know, you know, I should have had a recurrence. There was a 95% likelihood that I would have had a cancer recurrence in the first five years after my diagnosis,\" Holtz said. \"So I feel very blessed and lucky that that didn't happen to me. And ever since I've wanted to do everything I can to help other people who have went through what I went through.\" He attended a colorectal cancer awareness event, the Colorguard Classic, in Tuscon, last week. Holtz said he was able to connect with 300 survivors of the cancer at this event. It aims to raise money and awareness about the illness. Then, he hopped on a plane to Washington D.C. and spoke with legislators about colorectal cancer. Holtz said his goals in Washington were to advocate for $20 million in Department of Defense funding to be directed to the medical research program for colon cancer, to call for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase funding for the prevention of the illness and for lawmakers to join the congressional colorectal cancer caucus. Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett (R) answered the call, Holtz said. \"Cancer is a non-partisan issue, it affects all of us regardless of political affiliation,\" Holtz said. \"So it's not often we get a lot of pushback on cancer-related issues. But it was really exciting to get that level of support initially.\" Holtz said he and Burchett have spoken about the illness before. \"I had a productive meeting with Michael recently, and after that meeting, I joined the Colorectal Cancer Caucus,\" Rep. Burchett said. \"Advocates like Michael who have first-hand experience with the issue are an important part of the legislative process because they really know what’s needed.” Holtz said he encourages everyone to get screened. \"Get tested,\" he said. \"Go to your doctor. If you're 45 or older, you need to get screened for colorectal cancer.\"",

    "text": "Governor DeWine announces new traffic safety program in Springfield; provides updates on area health, education initiatives\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine visited Springfield Thursday to announce a new traffic safety initiative in Clark County that will train members of the local migrant community on safe driving skills.\nThe Maria Tiberi Foundation and Virtual Driver Interactive donated 10 new driving simulators to the Ohio Department of Public Safety's Ohio Traffic Safety Office for use in Springfield and Clark County. The new simulators have been placed in locations that serve members of the Haitian community who have recently migrated to the area in large numbers and have had little or no driver training.\n“One of the big issues we've seen with migrants in Clark County is that they are not used to driving here,\" said Governor DeWine. \"With the generous donations from the Maria Tiberi Foundation and Virtual Driver Interactive, this new program will help the Haitian population learn the rules of the road and allow them to practice defensive driving skills that can keep everyone on the roads safe.\"\nThis technology will give new drivers the opportunity to experience dangerous driving scenarios and hazards in a simulated environment, allowing them to practice their response to real-world obstacles without putting themselves or others at risk. Training scenarios include driving in severe weather; hydroplaning and skidding; overcorrection; distracted driving; variable traffic density; parallel parking and backing up; dangers of speeding; and the importance of seat belts.\n\"We need to educate our new drivers better and these simulators are a big step in the right direction,\" said Dom Tiberi, cofounder of the Maria Tiberi Foundation. “We want new drivers to learn in a safe environment. Don’t learn it on the highway. I believe the use of simulators is a great educational tool.\"\nThe 10 new driving simulators are located at:\n• Clark County Department of Job and Family Services (2)\n• Clark State College (2)\n• Springfield-Clark Career Technology Center (3)\n• High Street Church of the Nazarene (1)\n• First Haitian Evangelical Church of Springfield (1)\n• Life in Christ Community Church (1).\nUse of the simulators is free and will be managed by trainers and translators at each location. Anyone in Clark County working toward a driver's license can sign up to use the new simulators. Local licensed drivers can also use the simulators to gain additional experience in hazardous driving scenarios.\nAnyone with questions about the simulators should contact the Ohio Traffic Safety Office at .\nGovernor DeWine also Thursday provided an update on ongoing state efforts to surge healthcare support into the Springfield community.\nIn September, Governor DeWine directed the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) to work alongside the Clark County Combined Health District (CCCHD) to acquire a mobile health clinic – part of a $2.5 million commitment to reduce lengthy waitlists for healthcare services for all residents.\nBetween the opening of the mobile clinic and ODH sending nursing staff to support CCCHD’s existing clinic, the backlogs for appointments have largely been eliminated. More than 1,400 area residents have now received immunizations for everything from seasonal vaccinations, as well as vaccines for COVID, flu and RSV. Additionally, these clinics have provided hundreds of blood pressure screenings and referrals to other medical providers.\n“I am proud to say that we have caught up to the need. But our work is far from over. Our next step is making sure the healthcare system in Springfield will continue to efficiently and effectively serve everyone in this community for the long-term,” Governor DeWine said. “We’re now in the process of securing a site for a permanent health clinic. In the coming months, we will transition from the mobile unit to this permanent clinic as we continue to supplement the existing healthcare network in Clark County.”\nOther healthcare updates include:\n• ODH staff have helped register or recertify more than 600 area residents for the Clark County Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to ensure families are able to receive needed supplemental nutrition services.\n• ODH worked alongside Second Harvest Food Pantry to open a baby formula bank, and continues to work with local partners to implement strategies to increase breastfeeding and providing prenatal care to support new mothers and ensure their babies have what they need to thrive.\n• ODH’s Children’s Vision Team has worked with CCCHD and area schools to provide vision screenings for more than 7,600 local students. Now, this team is developing a strategy to secure eyeglasses for children who need them.\nFinally, Governor DeWine discussed progress supporting Springfield-area students in schools affected by the influx of Haitian migrants.\nIn September, the Governor and Ohio Department of Education and Workforce announced the award of over $1.3 million in grant funding to Springfield City School District to support a more productive learning environment for all students.\nTo date, the district has brought in seven interpreters and acquired over 460 translation technology devices to facilitate effective communication with non-English-speaking families and encourage greater parent involvement. The district is also now providing comprehensive mental health services for all students.\nPublisher's note: A free press is critical to having well-informed voters and citizens.
