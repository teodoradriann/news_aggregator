    "text": "CHICAGO - The city of Chicago announced Thursday the expansion of the Emergency Supplemental Victims Fund, which supports victims of gun violence , to include ten additional communities.With this expansion, Chicago residents impacted by gun violence in one of 15 total communities may now be eligible for assistance.Applicants can receive up to $1,000 for basic needs and an additional $1,000 for temporary relocation costs. The program also offers families up to $1,500 to help with funeral expenses.Approximately $6.4 million will be allocated to this program over the next two years, partially funded by the American Rescue Plan.\"These funds provide much-needed relief and stability for residents and families by lifting some of the burdens of victims and survivors,\" said Mayor Brandon Johnson. \"By lifting some of those burdens off their shoulders, we can help them on their path and journey to full healing. And ultimately, they can be strengthened by those funds, helping us to prevent repeat incidences of violence and ultimately contributing to safer communities.\"The program was initially piloted in 2022 in five communities. Since its inception, the mayor’s office reports it has provided financial assistance to nearly 400 victims and survivors of gun violence.

    "title": "Don Kusler: Democrats dominated 2023 with victories for reproductive rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box.\nVirginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office.\nThat's a victory for Democrats.\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate.\nThat's another victory for the left.\nTwo ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state.\nPeople are also reading…\nThen on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin.\nThese electoral victories make a difference.\nJust look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize.\nLabor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts.\nWorkers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers.\nSometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans.\nIt was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business.\nLeadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people.\nThe one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job.\nDid the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker.\nThe sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats.\nSo a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories.\nYes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats.\nKusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action:\nadaction.org.

    "text": "[Air Marakanda, Uzbekistan](/news/air-marakanda%2C-uzbekistan/) 28 Dec, 2023, 21:11 GMT [] SAMARKAND, Uzbekistan, Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Air Marakanda, the management company operating Samarkand International Airport, today announced a doubling of passenger traffic for the year, compared with 495,000 passengers in 2022, and welcomed its one millionth passenger. The milestone not only represents the booming tourism appeal of Uzbekistan's second city, but also highlights the successful growth strategy being pursued by the company. The record-breaking passenger was Tajikistan resident Mr. Dilshod Rakhimov, who flew to Abu Dhabi on Wizz Air flight 5W7164. To celebrate the event, Dmitry Martynenko, Air Marakanda's Commercial Director, presented the millionth passenger with souvenirs and a voucher for the airport's VIP lounge. Wizz Air also congratulated the passenger and presented him with a voucher covering the cost of a flight to Abu Dhabi. Anton Khojayan, CEO of Air Marakanda, said: \"Serving our first millionth passenger has capped off a landmark year for our company. We opened new destinations in cooperation with partner airlines, increased the frequency of flights of existing air carriers, and developed Samarkand's airport infrastructure - all of which led us to the cherished figure of one million. We are especially pleased today to congratulate a record-breaking passenger and end the year with a celebration. We are eager to push our growth trajectory even higher, and I am confident that next year we will achieve even better results.\" Air Marakanda opened the airport's architecturally stunning new terminal less than two years ago, after becoming the first private participant in a public/private partnership in aviation in Uzbekistan. Johan Eidhagen, Managing Director of Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, said: \"We are delighted to celebrate one year of operations to Samarkand and our contribution in supporting the airport to reach the significant milestone of one million passengers. Wizz Air has introduced a new era of ultra-low-cost travel to the market, unlocked affordable travel opportunities, and carried more than 100,000 passengers to and from Samarkand. This stands as a testimonial on how we can stimulate more demand through our model by making travel accessible for everyone.\" He added, \"We are looking forward to doubling our numbers in 2024 by carrying the flag of ultra-low-cost travel into the region and stimulating more demand by unlocking affordable travel opportunities for both residents and visitors of Samarkand.\" The millionth passenger milestone coincides with Samarkand International Airport being ranked among the top 5 largest airports in Europe in terms of passenger traffic growth, according to the European branch of the International Airports Council (ACI Europe). According to results tabulated as of October, Samarkand airport took 4th place in the category of regional and small airports. About Air Marakanda Air Marakanda is responsible for ground handling and management of the new Samarkand International Airport terminal. It is the first project in the aviation industry of the Republic of Uzbekistan based on public-private partnership.

    "text": "El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional de Estados Unidos emitió una alerta de tormenta geomagnética severa para este viernes, como resultado de una serie de erupciones solares, una situación que se produce por primera vez en dos décadas.A través de un comunicado, el Centro de Predicción del Clima Espacial (SWPC, en inglés) de la Oficina Nacional de Administración Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA, en inglés), una división del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, alertó de esta particular situación, de la que se ofrecerán más detalles en las próximas horas.Las tormentas geomagnéticas, explica el comunicado, pueden tener impacto en la infraestructura orbital terrestre y en la superficie de la Tierra con el potencial de interferir con las comunicaciones, la red de energía eléctrica, la navegación y las operaciones de radio y de satélites.La serie de erupciones comenzó el 8 de mayo y las condiciones para que la tormenta persista podrían durar durante todo el fin de semana.\"Una gran mancha solar ha producido erupciones desde moderadas a muy fuertes desde el miércoles\", señaló la agencia. \"Al menos cinco de esas erupciones estuvieron asociadas con eyecciones de masa de la corona solar que parecen dirigidas hacia la Tierra\".Estas eyecciones son explosiones de plasma y campos magnéticos en la corona solar que causan tormentas geomagnéticas cuando ocurren en dirección a la Tierra, explicó NOAA.La gran mancha solar ha lanzado una secuencia asombrosa de cinco eyecciones de masa solar hacia la Tierra, según la plataforma Spacewather.com, que estima que, si se tratara de un huracán, sería de categoría 4.*Mantente al día con las noticias, únete a nuestro canal de WhatsApp aquí: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaAf9Pu9hXF1EJ561i03 MV",

    "text": "La Cina orientale si prepara ad affrontare la tempesta tropicale Kong-rey , che ha perso forza trasformandosi da tifone a tempesta tropicale nelle ultime ore. Nonostante l’indebolimento, Kong-rey porterà piogge intense e venti forti su Shanghai e lungo le coste di Zhejiang e Jiangsu , spingendo le autorità locali a prendere provvedimenti precauzionali.\nTaiwan duramente colpita Ieri Kong-rey ha attraversato Taiwan con la forza di un tifone, causando ingenti danni. Forti venti e piogge torrenziali hanno sradicato alberi, provocato frane e danneggiato diverse abitazioni. Il bilancio delle vittime riporta 2 morti e oltre 500 feriti , mentre numerose strade sono rimaste bloccate e interrotte. Tuttavia, ci sono state anche buone notizie: le autorità della provincia orientale di Hualien sono riuscite a ristabilire il contatto con una coppia di turisti cechi che si trovavano nel Parco Nazionale di Taroko, accampati in una tenda. Secondo la Central News Agency, la coppia è in buone condizioni.\nPrevisioni e rischi per la Cina orientale La tempesta tropicale Kong-rey si sta dirigendo verso Nord/Est lungo la costa cinese, con una possibile incursione a terra prevista oggi nella provincia di Zhejiang. L’ultimo bollettino del Centro Meteorologico Nazionale prevede precipitazioni intense, con accumuli fino a 12 cm in alcune zone e venti di forte intensità, specialmente nelle province di Zhejiang, Jiangsu e nella metropoli di Shanghai.\nPer prevenire eventuali incidenti, le autorità della provincia di Zhejiang e la vicina Fujian hanno già sospeso numerose rotte dei traghetti, limitando i trasporti in vista dell’arrivo della tempesta. A Taiwan, nel frattempo, dopo l’ondata di maltempo, il clima è tornato più tranquillo con piogge leggere nella capitale Taipei, dove scuole e uffici hanno ripreso le loro attività e i servizi pubblici sono stati ripristinati.\nUna stagione di tifoni devastante Kong-rey è solo l’ultima tempesta di una stagione già segnata da eventi estremi. La scorsa settimana, la tempesta tropicale Trami ha causato devastazioni nelle Filippine, costringendo migliaia di persone ad abbandonare le proprie case e lasciando dietro di sé un bilancio di almeno 145 vittime. Anche in Cina le forti piogge provocate da Trami hanno avuto conseguenze letali, con 7 morti segnalati nella provincia di Hainan, famosa meta turistica per le sue spiagge.",

    "title": "Rodo Bulacio: Amor, margaritas, memoria",
    "text": "Si tus besos me despiertan, bésame que estoy dormido… El amor consumado en matrimonio porque Nací para tí!!! Es 1995 en San Miguel de Tucumán , Tucumán. Las parejas -felices- recién casadas se sacan fotos en el reloj floral del Parque 9 de Julio, posan marido y mujer. Rodo Bulacio envuelto en blanquísima tela voile y margaritas, sonríe a la cámara, a los augurosos tiempos que vendrán una vez que se ha unido para siempre, hasta que la muerte los separe, con el arte. Sus amistades han ido a acompañarlo. La convocatoria, en un folleto que también contiene la receta para hacer una “torta de bodas”, era a las 20:30, pero seguramente todo empezó un poco más tarde. Después de las fotos, la caravana de autos que va hasta el salón de la fiesta , sale. Ahí es donde se cortará la torta –que hizo su mamá–, se bailará el vals y se tirará el ramo de la novia. La Rodo baja de un auto rojo al llegar. En la sala, también los acompañan pinturas que cuentan otra historia de amor, la de sus padres, Porota y Rodolfo. Entre colores contundentes, entre amistades y todos los rituales canónicos del casamiento Mucha Karakatanga en la Koctelera es el nombre de esta performance icónica de Bulacio, la primera novia del Arte. En Tucumán, pero en 2024, un camino de margaritas plásticas atraviesa una sala rosa, la segunda siguiendo el recorrido planteado por la curaduría. En ella, están las obras y el registro que quedó de Mucha Karakatanga , que se acerca a su treinta aniversario. Hasta marzo, Rodolfo Bulacio. Fantasía marica del pueblo podrá verse en el Museo de la Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (MUNT), en el marco de la propuesta del Palais de Glace de estudio sobre el artista. La muestra, curada por Geli González y Guadalupe Creche , es una antología de la producción del artista nacido en Monteros, Tucumán, que reúne obra de sus tres muestras individuales, algunos ejercicios de su paso por la Facultad de Artes y trabajos de los colectivos de los que formó parte. “Recién dimensioné, haciendo el trabajo para la muestra, el sentido que tenía todo lo que hacíamos en la posdictadura del gobierno de Bussi”, dice Geli González, quien, además de co-curar esta exposición, coincidió con Bulacio en la década del ‘90 en en Tenor Grasso , un colectivo de performance por el que pasaron, además de Bulacio y González, otros artistas de la escena tucumana, como Sergio Gatica, Carlota Beltrame , Jorge Lobato Coronel, Jorge Gutiérrez, entre ellos. El mismo año de Mucha Karakatanga , también 1995 en Tucumán, Antonio Domingo Bussi , represor y genocida durante la última dictadura militar había sido votado como gobernador democrático de la provincia. “Salíamos de un contexto muy represivo, con todo lo residual de la posdictadura. También estaban el asesinato de Carlos María Navarro –exdecano de la Facultad de Artes– y su hermana Clara Imelda Navarro –ambos fueron asesinados a finales del ‘90–”, recuerda González. “Yo no tenía idea, no dimensionaba en ese momento lo disruptivas que eran las propuestas en el contexto. La liberación de los cuerpos era algo que sucedía muy naturalmente para mí entonces, pero hoy entiendo el por qué de la convocatoria, el seguimiento que tuvo Tenor Grasso y el seguimiento con el grupo”, agrega. En el país y en Tucumán, los noventa fueron años paradójicos . Qué hubiese sucedido, si la vida hubiese seguido para Rodo. La pregunta rezuma en sus obras, también se la hacen sus curadoras, existe en una biografía artística que de golpe, se corta. En 1997, Rodolfo Bulacio fue asesinado en un crimen de odio , una noche a comienzos de ese año, cuando había vuelto a su casa después de una reunión. Antes de irse, los asesinos prendieron fuego el departamento, con su cuerpo y buena parte de sus obras. No la pierdo a la cabeza porque la tengo pegada, ja, ja, las palabras están escritas junto a bocetos de paquete de cigarrillos Camel. En la primera sala de la exposición, cuelga esta pintura verde, sobreviviente al incendio. Quienes lo conocieron, sobre todo de chico, cuentan la predisposición al arte que siempre tuvo Rodo Bulacio. Desde niño, desde adolescente, cuando se mudó de Monteros a San Miguel de Tucumán para estudiar la carrera de artes en la Facultad. “Él era una esponja, también era algo de época, estábamos desesperados por alcanzar algo, no sé qué, por aggiornarnos. Los contactos que íbamos teniendo eran una vorágine, la sensación del tiempo en el cuerpo”, explica González sobre esos años de performance constante, de transformaciones, de vestir, de mostrar el cuerpo. La exposición empieza en amarillo con Blanka…enseña lo que has conseguido (Homenaje a todos mis muertos), un conjunto de obras de su última muestra individual (en 1996) que es un homenaje a los muertos de Bulacio, especialmente a su abuela Blanca. Para la curadora, esta y la reunión de objetos de Mucha Karakatanga –en la segunda sala– muestran a un artista que empezaba a consolidar su proyecto. “Las propuestas que hace, son muy maduras –en Blanka y Mucha Karakatanga–, creo que el proyecto es muy sólido. Todo lo anterior es un proceso de búsqueda, de estudio. Para mí, esas dos muestras anunciaban proyectos que no desarrolló, que no pudo llegar a desarrollar… Qué hubiese sucedido si la vida hubiera seguido para Rodo”, expresa. Adjetivado como insumiso y desobediente, “Yo hago todo”, enuncia el mismo Rodo en el texto de la última sala de la exposición, Karta Nova , una serie de pinturas del ‘93. Vive en los comienzos, en la vorágine de nacer y empezar, de pensar que la vida es larga, que va a seguir. Vive en la paradoja de haber hecho en su última exposición un homenaje a sus muertos, en haber demostrado que sabía velar y guardar memoria, que sabía recordar luminosamente.",
