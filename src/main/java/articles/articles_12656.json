    "text": "The International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) has made a strong case for collaborative efforts in addressing pressing challenges affecting Ghanaian farmers. IFDC underscored the importance of individuals in the agricultural value chain embracing the spirit of collaboration towards the shared goal of agricultural transformation in the country. The Director of IFDC, Enabling Impact Program, Dr. Bocar Diagana, made these remarks when he delivered the keynote address during the IFDC 2024 Open Door event on the occasion of its 50th-anniversary launch of IFDC, on February 15. Dr. Diagana emphasized the need for Ghanaians to leverage their collective knowledge in using agriculture as a catalyst for sustainable development. “I urge each one of us gathered here today to embrace the spirit of collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity as we work towards our shared goal of agricultural transformation in Ghana. Let us leverage our collective strengths, knowledge, and resources to overcome challenges, seize opportunities, and build a brighter future for our farmers, communities, and the country Ghana.” In conclusion, I am confident that through our collective efforts and unwavering commitment, we can realize the full potential of agriculture as a catalyst for sustainable development and prosperity in Ghana. Together, let us embark on this journey with renewed vigour, determination, and unity of purpose.” He expressed IFDC’s commitment to developing and deploying technologies that will improve the capacity of the soil to ensure food security. “IFDC is committed to positively impacting Ghanaian agriculture value chain stakeholders by collaborating and building a stronger force to address the challenges confronting farmers, so we can continue to promote food and nutrition security and help improve the livelihoods of our farmers. As we celebrate IFDC’s 50th Anniversary this year, our vision has remained the same with a renewed focus on caring for the soil. We do not intend to just commemorate the past but use our fine and rich expertise and accumulated experience to care for soils for the next 50 years.” On her part, the Acting Country Director for IFDC Ghana, Judith Fagbegnon Kodjo, expressed her appreciation to the government for its unfailing support. “I would therefore like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to our donors of our projects and programs: DGIS and USAID. Thank you for your continued trust that enables us to get this far. I would also particularly like to thank the Government of Ghana through the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration for their unfailing support.” Touching on IFDC’s 50 years of contributions to global agriculture, the IFDC Global Corporate Communications Manager, James Thigpen, said they have researched and developed more than 50 innovations in soil health research. He assured IFDC’s commitment to developing market system technologies to help achieve higher yields. “We are committed to developing a market system to help achieve higher yields and will continue to improve soil health for healthy crops. Nearly 150 countries reached with new technologies, trainings, and pro-agriculture policies. Researched and developed more than 50 innovations in soil health research, nutrient delivery, market access, agricultural policies, and more. Millions of families to experience improved livelihoods!” About IFDC IFDC is an independent non-profit organization that combines innovative research, market systems development, and strategic partnerships to spread sustainable agricultural solutions for soil health, food security, and improved livelihoods around the world. Since 1974, IFDC has worked to promote local economic development based on agriculture through a bottom-up approach. ——– Explore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!

    "text": "Julian Lennon, cantor e compositor britânico, filho de John Lennon, foi diagnosticado com cancro da pele e submetido a uma cirurgia de emergência.\nJulian Lennon, de 61 anos, revelou na quarta-feira, no Instagram, que teve de fazer uma cirurgia de emergência para retirar um melanoma, um tipo de cancro da pele agressivo.\nNa publicação, em que inclui fotografias sensíveis, explica que foi diagnosticado com o melanoma depois de uma consulta em Los Angeles, nos Estados Unidos, com a mesma dermatologista que, anos antes, \"lhe salvou a vida\" ao diagnosticar cancro da pele.\nA médica informou-o que tinha de ser operado \"o mais rápido possível\" devido a dois sinais perigosos, um no ombro e outro no antebraço, e que um deles era um melanoma.\n\"Em vez de ir para casa para montar a minha árvore de Natal e terminar o ano feliz, a relaxar em casa, voei diretamente de volta para Los Angeles (...) e fui diretamente do aeroporto para a cirurgia\", conta.\nFoi operado durante \"várias horas\" por um cirurgião recomendado pela sua dermatologista. Agora aguarda a biopsia, que pode não chegar antes do Natal.\nNa mesma publicação, Julian Lennon apela a que as pessoas \"consultem os médicos\" pelo próprio bem e pelo \"bem da família e amigos\".\n\"Amo a vida e quero viver por muito tempo. Esta é uma maneira e uma escolha que pode determinar seu futuro\", remata.\nJulian, filho mais velho de John Lennon, já tinha sido diagnosticado com cancro há alguns anos. Quando tinha 56 anos, foi operado a um tumor maligno num sinal na cabeça. A sua mãe, Cynthia Powell, morreu com cancro, em Maiorca, em 2015.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "A Conservative MP has been criticised for suggesting most children who struggle in an English town are the “products of crap parents”. James Daly was accused by his Labour rival of “insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury” after the remark was made in a newspaper piece analysing election prospects for the Greater Manchester town. Mr Daly, speaking to the i newspaper, stressed the importance of “stability” offered by the family unit as he outlined what the New Conservatives group of MPs stands for. The Bury North MP said: “I think New Conservatives represent very much working-class conservatism. “We’re not a strange right-wing sect. It’s just people who want to give people the best chance to succeed and thrive in life. “When you think about the family, it’s about stability. “Most of the kids who struggle in Bury are the products of crap parents and so what do we do to try to address that issue? “On the left it would just be we’ll throw money at this and hope something sticks, somebody like me thinks about this more fundamentally.” James Frith, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Bury North, said: “It is revealing to see how little James Daly thinks of his own constituents. “Rather than insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury, he should look closer to home. “Over the last 13 years the Conservatives have failed to grow our economy, protect our public services or provide opportunities for young people in Bury and across the UK.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Malgré ce montant exorbitant, la fortune de Mme Bettencourt demeure bien en dessous de celle de Bernard Arnault, fondateur français du groupe de luxe LVMH, qui trônait à la deuxième place de l’Indice Bloomberg des milliardaires mercredi soir, avec une valeur de 179 milliards $ US (236 milliards $ CA). Mme Bettencourt, âgée de 70 ans, est vice-présidente du conseil d’administration de L’Oréal, une entreprise à la renommée mondiale qui vaut 241 milliards d’euros (351 milliards $ CA).

    "text": "1個月連2人大腸癌「才30幾歲」！ 醫疾呼提早做大腸鏡篩檢\n大腸癌逐漸年輕化！（示意圖／翻攝自pexels）\n「大腸癌逐漸年輕化！改變就從現在開始」。肝膽腸胃科醫師張靖透露，自己在最近1個月內，就連續診斷出2位年僅30多歲的年輕人罹患直腸癌，因此他也提醒，及早的大腸鏡篩檢非常重要，並列出大腸癌年輕化的3個可能原因。\n張靖醫師近日在臉書發文透露，光是最近1個月內，他的門診就連續出現2位年僅30多歲的年輕人，原本都以為血便只是痔瘡引起，沒想到經過大腸鏡檢查後，竟確診為直腸癌。這樣的檢查結果不僅對病人和家屬造成沉重打擊，也讓張靖醫師感到十分不捨。\n張靖醫師在文中強調，雖然大多數血便確實是由痔瘡引起，但在未經大腸鏡檢查確認前，醫師永遠無法百分之百排除大腸癌的可能性。他認為自己的角色，正是要透過大腸鏡檢查，幫助病人及早釐清血便背後真正的病因。\n面對世界各國都正面臨「大腸癌年輕化」的嚴峻趨勢，張靖醫師分析可能與多項因素有關，包括飲食西化（高油脂、低纖維）、生活型態改變（久坐缺乏運動）以及腸道菌落失衡等問題，當然少部分年輕大腸癌的情況與家族遺傳性高度相關。\n張靖醫師也強調，「至少我們可將『健康且規律的生活、及早的大腸鏡篩檢』這些觀念落實在日常生活當中，如此才能大幅降低憾事再度發生。」\n臺北市立聯合醫院官網日前也發布新聞稿指出，依據國民健康署癌症登記資料顯示，110年大腸癌新診斷個案有1萬6,238人，發生率為每十萬人38.4人，更是十大癌症發生人數第2名，平均每天有44人罹患大腸癌，且近9成的個案是發生在50歲以上的民眾；衛福部112年死因統計有6,791人死於大腸癌。為降低大腸癌發生率及死亡率，規律且及早接受糞便潛血篩檢與大腸鏡檢查是很重要的關鍵。\n大腸癌常見症狀如下：大便中有血或黏液、排便習慣改變（一下子腹瀉，一下子便秘）、大便變細小、經常性腹瀉或便秘、體重減輕、貧血、裡急後重（排便排不乾淨）。然而可怕的是，大腸癌早期並無症狀。\n臺北市立聯合醫院中興院區消化內科主任謝文斌，在門診中遇到有明顯症狀而來的病人，檢查後常常都已經是中晚期大腸癌，治療起來複雜且困難；而且治療過程與結果對病人及家屬都是一個沉重的負荷。\n謝文斌也提醒，大腸癌是可以藉由定期接受篩檢而早期發現並治療的一種疾病。根據統計，早期的大腸癌如果妥善治療，存活率高達90%以上。相反的，如果大腸癌進展至第4期才診斷出來，5年存活率只剩15至16%。根據歐美國家經驗，每1至2年接受糞便潛血篩檢約可下降18至33%的大腸癌死亡率。\n大腸癌的風險因子包含肥胖、缺乏運動、抽菸以及大腸直腸癌家族史等。謝文斌建議大家養成良好飲食習慣，多吃蔬菜水果，少吃肉類及高油脂食物，並且規律運動，還要定期篩檢「糞便潛血檢查」及「大腸鏡檢查」。\n謝文斌文末也提醒，中壯年族群在社會經濟及家庭具重要角色，大腸癌年輕化，不只對家庭影響巨大，也會造成總體經濟損失。若能早期發現，可以單純使用大腸鏡切除，避免了開刀的風險與後續化療的煎熬。「為了家人與自己健康著想，記得按時接受篩檢，遠離大腸癌，才能擁抱健康的人生。」",
