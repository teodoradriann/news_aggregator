    "text": "Bas-Saint-Laurent: un homme de 31 ans atteint par balle à Sainte-Angèle-de-Mérici\nUne opération policière a permis de retrouver deux suspects après la prise en charge d’un homme avec une importante blessure par arme à feu, à Sainte-Angèle-de-Mérici, dans le Bas-Saint-Laurent, jeudi.\nLa Sûreté du Québec (SQ) a été informée, vers 9h30, de l’événement survenu dans une résidence de la rue Laurent-Thibeault, dans cette petite municipalité située dans la MRC de La Mitis.\nLa victime, un homme de 31 ans, a été transférée dans un centre hospitalier pour des blessures «sérieuses» mais qui «ne mettraient pas sa vie en danger», selon le corps policier.\n«Nous avons immédiatement déclenché une opération policière dans le but de localiser le véhicule suspect sur les différents axes routiers dans le Bas-Saint-Laurent», explique la SQ dans un communiqué.\nEnviron une heure après le signalement initial, ce dernier était retrouvé dans le secteur de la route 132 à Notre-Dame-des-Neiges, à une centaine de kilomètres de distance.\nUn homme de 23 ans et une femme de 28 ans originaires de la grande région de Montréal ont été arrêtés et interrogés par la Division des enquêtes sur les crimes majeurs.\nIls demeurent détenus et ils devraient comparaître devant un juge vendredi, sous des accusations qui n’ont pas été précisées.\nSelon la SQ, il est «trop tôt» pour faire un lien entre cet événement et la guerre pour le contrôle du marché des stupéfiants, qui fait rage depuis quelques mois dans la grande région de Québec et qui aurait également eu des retombées jusque sur la Côte-Nord.",

    "text": "NEW YORK -- A federal judge in New York on Thursday rejected former President Donald Trump's bid for a new trial in a defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll. The ruling upheld the jury's $83.3 million damage award. \"Contrary to the defendant's arguments, Ms. Carroll's compensatory damages were not awarded solely for her emotional distress; they were not for garden variety harms; and they were not excessive,\" Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote. \"Mr. Trump's malicious and unceasing attacks on Ms. Carroll were disseminated to more than 100 million people,\" he added. \"They included public threats and personal attacks, and they endangered Ms. Carroll's health and safety.\" Robbie Kaplan, Carroll's attorney, celebrated the ruling. \"We are pleased with though not surprised by the Court's decision today denying Donald Trump's motions for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law,\" she said in a statement. \"As the Court explained, it was entirely reasonable for the jury to award E. Jean Carroll $83 million in damages given Donald Trump's continued defamation of Ms. Carroll during the trial itself, as well as his conduct in the courtroom where his 'hatred and disdain [were] on full display.'\" At the end of a five-day trial in February, Trump was ordered to pay $83.3 million to Carroll, a former Elle magazine columnist, for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her allegations of sexual abuse. Carroll was awarded $17.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages. In May 2023, Trump was found liable in a separate trial for sexually abusing Carroll in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in the 1990s, and defaming her in a 2022 social media post by calling her allegations \"a Hoax and a lie\" and saying, \"This woman is not my type!\" While he was found liable for sexual abuse, jury members found that Trump did not rape Carroll as she claimed. Trump rejected all accusations of wrongdoing and claimed he had not even heard of Carroll. The ruling Thursday from Kaplan rejected each of Trump's lawyer's claims, ultimately deciding, \"In short, the argument -- which Mr. Trump previously made to the jury, conspicuously without success, and which defies common sense -- does not warrant dismissal as a matter of law.\" ABC News' Peter Charalambous and Olivia Rubin contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Digging deeper According to [streamflow data](https://www.brazosbasinnow.org/map/?zoom=8&lat=31.59931606860853&lon=-98.01770515335186&sensor_class=10|30|MINUTE&view=4e2fd344-1ae4-40fd-90d5-9cc91f8be6e8&view=4e2fd344-1ae4-40fd-90d5-9cc91f8be6e8&show_location_names=true&geolayers=fdfe36e4_6d43_0699_bcbc_5541049f66f6|dbd7c09c_5646_4e6f_829c_d665e3b57f99|73e8d859_f8c6_4bb3_9cec_4c6c7fdd5baa&opacity=0.6)on the Brazos River Authority's website, the Sugar Land gauge at Hwy. 59 measured 58,200 cubic feet per second—a streamflow of about 28,000 cfs more than it was at the same time May 2. Engineers used predictive modeling and gauges to predict the river level at the Sugar Land gauge will peak at 67.4 feet above sea level around noon May 11, according to the website. That level remains in the “minor” stage; however, the Sugar Land site would enter the “moderate” flood stage if it rose further to 68.5 feet above sea level. Additionally, the National Weather Service issued two river flood warnings at the Hwy. 59 gauge and on the Rosharon gauge at FM 1462, Fort Bend County officials said at a May 8 news conference. What this means Most parks and roadways along the Brazos River are expected to stay open, but the connector road between [Brazos River Park](https://communityimpact.com/houston/sugar-land-missouri-city/government/2024/03/08/eyeing-erosion-brazos-river-projects-gain-state-federal-funding/)and Memorial Park as well as the mountain bike trails will close May 9 due to minor flooding, Sugar Land Communications Director Doug Adolph said in an email. The parks are in the river’s floodway, meaning it’s designed to hold floodwaters. Elsewhere, residential areas near the Brazos River are protected by manmade levees, Adolph said. “Residents are encouraged to remain away from the Brazos River until conditions improve; sightseers have wandered dangerously close to the Brazos River when it has crested in the past,” a May 7 Facebook post from the city of Sugar Land read. “Fast-moving currents, loose soil, snakes and excessive ants pose a real threat.” What they're saying At the May 8 news conference, County Judge KP George said the county’s Homeland Security & Emergency Management office has been monitoring the river levels and will ensure residents are well-informed. “It is crucial that everyone understand the potential threat possibly coming our way or our area can face,” he said in the livestreamed video. George encouraged residents to reach out to their neighbors—roughly 80% of whom weren't born in the U.S., he said—and explain what to expect with the rising river levels. Potentially exacerbating river levels is anticipated rainfall later this week, county officials said. Zooming in The Brazos River watershed is 1,050 miles and comprises 44,620 square miles, according to the Brazos River Authority's [website](https://brazos.org/About-Us/Environmental/Brazos-River-Watershed). Judi Pierce, public information officer with the Brazos River Authority, said multiple storms happening upstream in Central Texas since May 1 are contributing to the flooding in Fort Bend County. “Mostly it’s rainfall in Central Texas that is on the main stem of the Brazos, and there’s not a flood control reservoir to catch that as it’s heading down the Brazos,” she said.Remember this?
