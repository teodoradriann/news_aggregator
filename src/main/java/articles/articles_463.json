    "title": "Garden Guy: Crown your 2025 spring garden with Supertunia Tiara Pink",
    "text": "Garden Guy: Next year's spring garden will be the belle of the ball with Supertunia Tiara Pink Norman Winter | For the Savannah Morning News One of the plants that literally took my breath away at the plant trials this year was the new Supertunia Tiara Pink. Shoot, I am not even a pink flower guy in the least, but this one had me mesmerized. Subsequently the ones made available to me in testing have been the same ― and Holy Wow!\nI’ve recently posted a photo on my Facebook page, and it quickly brought in the accolades and comments. More than one comment came from gardeners who were already growing it despite Supertunia Tiara Pink not making its debut until 2025. I suppose that it was a soft release.\nSupertunia Tiara Pink will reach about 12 inches tall with a 24 inch spread. I am watching not only my personal plants but some I slipped into VIP and high visibility targets. I am thinking we may get more spread in the south, but regardless, this will be on the must-have list next spring. The color blends are what make this flower so incredible.\nMore Garden Guy: Plant lovers Totally Stoked for bodacious blue and white asters\nProven Winners calls the color \"Princess Pink\" with a white center. I suppose that is true, but I see a much richer pink around the white. Its funny even on the Proven Winners site, the photos look a little subdued compared to what I have seen. But this may be one of those plants that give you a variance in color depending on the amount of sun, time of day and cloud cover. In fact, I remember the day of the Young’s Plant Farm Annual Garden Tour. It was a heavy overcast morning. My camera is capturing what I am seeing with my eyes.\nI would be remiss if I didn’t tell you there is also a Supertunia Tiara Blue, which that will be the subject of a later column. I had Facebook followers ask if it would partner well with Supertunia Vista Bubblegum, and I suppose it would, but to me that would be a waste since Bubblegum is so vigorous.\nSupertunia Tiara Pink deserves to be grown with a blue like Supertunia Mini Vista Indigo petunia or Superbells Grape Punch calibrachoa. Go ahead and say those are purple. Son James and the Eden Estate Management team used it at a streetside bed around a mailbox and partnered it with various Luscious Royale lantanas. To me it was pushing the envelope, but I also have to admit it was stunning. I suspect one of the future hallmark combos will be Supertunia Tiara Pink with a new scaevola also showing up next year called Stardiva Blue.\nSupertunia Tiara Pink will need fertile well-drained soil. I already mentioned my son planted some in a raised curbside bed, but containers and baskets with a really good potting soil are easy-peasy. This year has been like none other with intense heat and virtually no rain. I have had to water containers twice a day several times.\nFertilization plays a key role with Supertunias, even more so when watered twice a day. I use a water-soluble mix and pour from a watering can with a spout. That is my method and occurs every 2 to 3 weeks in the morning before the Mrs. has breakfast. Cutting back by a third has been vital in the south this year on Supertunias, Superbells and Superbenas. I know it is my imagination, but the plants almost seem to say thanks.\nNext year will be amazing for gardeners with new plant introductions. Maybe we all needed a tough year to hone our gardening skills. So, get ready and brush up on your photography skills too, you will really need them next year.\nFollow Norman Winter on Facebook @NormanWinterTheGardenGuy for more photos and garden inspiration.

    "title": "‘Floating pool’ to open in NYC river in 2025",
    "text": "Who’s up for a dip in the East River? Or maybe the Hudson? After more than a decade of fits and starts, a floating pool that’s shaped like a plus sign is headed for one of New York City’s waterways this summer — though it won’t be open to the public until 2025, assuming tests go well. Once completed, the 9,000-square-foot pool, created by a crowdfunded company called +POOL, promises a chemical-free filtration system that takes in hundreds of thousands of gallons of river water and makes it more palatable to swimmers. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams made the announcement Friday. They said a test version of the pool and its filtration system will be placed in a New York City waterway — exact location TBD — to ensure it meets state and city health guidelines. The state is pledging $12 million toward the effort, with the city chipping in another $4 million. “This was an invention that [makes it] possible to use our own waterways to find pools in communities who have historically been ignored,\" Adams said at the Children's Aid Dunlevy Milbank Community Center in Harlem. The pool idea has been — ahem — floated in New York City for years. The company, +POOL, launched [a Kickstarter campaign back in 2013](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/694835844/pool-tile-by-tile/description), raising more than $270,000 by promising to engrave donors’ names into tiles that will make up the pool and its deck. Then there was a fancy PR campaign in 2018, backed by Heineken, the beer brand. It featured [an eight-minute mini documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi9okFb6wvs) on the history of the company and floating pools — narrated by none other than Neil Patrick Harris – and was paired with a petition at a now-defunct website, SwimInTheRiver.com. In 2021, New York City gave a tentative green light to the project — known as a notice to proceed with due diligence — in the East River near Manhattan’s Two Bridges neighborhood, between the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge. But the exact location of the test facility or the final pool itself is now to be determined, according to the governor’s office. A press release from the mayor’s office didn’t specify a location either. Hochul, meanwhile, seems ready to take the concept statewide. The announcement Friday was part of a package of investments in swimming facilities, lifeguard training and learn-to-swim programs. Hochul pledged to put up $60 million in state funding for competitive grants to deploy floating pools in waterways across the state. “This is how you open up your rivers and waterways to the public,” she said. An earlier version of this story misstated the square footage of the proposed floating pool. It is 9,000 square feet.",

    "text": "Outstanding Performances’: 2 Long Island Ducks Make All-Star Team\nCENTRAL ISLIP, NY — Two rising stars from the Long Island Ducks are earning league-wide recognition for their red-hot first-half performances. Catcher Ronaldo Flores and outfielder River Town have both been named to the 2025 Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB) Mid-Season All-Star Team, league officials announced this week.\nThe selections, made by the league’s 10 field managers, shine a spotlight on the Ducks’ strong showing this season and highlight the impact of two first-year players who’ve quickly become fan favorites.\nFlores, 23, has been dominant at the plate, leading the entire Atlantic League with a .362 batting average through the first half. His powerful swing has delivered 7 home runs, 30 RBIs, and a team-best .546 slugging percentage. He also notched a 14-game hitting streak, the longest by any Duck this season.\nTown, equally impressive, has showcased all-around excellence. The speedy outfielder is fifth in on-base percentage (.429) and tenth in batting average (.327), with 6 home runs, 36 RBIs, 38 runs scored, and 17 stolen bases. His .950 OPS leads the team and ranks among the best in the league.\n“Congratulations to Ronaldo and River on being recognized for their outstanding performances,” said Ducks manager Lew Ford. “They’ve made an immediate impact on this team, and it’s great to see their hard work and talent honored at the league level.”\nThe Ducks finished the first half seven games above .500, and the contributions from Flores and Town have been key to their success.\nFans can catch the All-Star action later this summer, where the Ducks’ newest stars will represent Long Island on the league’s biggest stage. Until then, the second half of the season promises more fireworks — and these two are just getting started.\nFor updates, subscribe to our free newsletter!\nSupport your local news!\nMore News from Central Islip\nLove and Light’: Beloved Gastropub Reopens as New Italian Eatery on LI’s South Shore By Samantha Vogel-HesposLove and Light’: Beloved Gastropub Reopens as New Italian Eatery on LI’s South Shore\nBy Samantha Vogel-HesposA Decade of Heartache: Families Demand Accountability 10 Years After North Fork Limo TragedyA Decade of Heartache: Families Demand Accountability 10 Years After North Fork Limo Tragedy",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

Video has been released from inside of the bus that crashed over the weekend in Oklahoma City, causing damages to a business and injuries. On Saturday, police arrested a man accused of assaulting an Embark bus driver. Tihron Harrison was arrested for assault and battery. The bus ran into a business off North Western and Britton Road around 2:20 p.m. Saturday. Lt. Jeff Cooper with the Oklahoma City Police Department said, \"When they [officers] arrived, they found that the subject actually assaulted the bus driver, causing him to leave the roadway and enter the Britton lumber building,\" A passenger became irate after the bus driver told him he could not stop the bus for an early stop, according to investigators. Cooper said, \"The suspect then began punching the bus driver in the face and removed him from the driver's seat. This caused the bus to leave the roadway and run into the Britton Lumber business.\" Officials said two people were inside \" Britton Lumber \" but were not injured. The bus driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. The police report noted that Harrison was still on the scene when police arrived, but refused to be detained. Police said he ran off and tried to jump a fence. He was arrested and taken to a local hospital for a medical release.",

    "text": "PICKENS COUNTY, Ga. — Christmas may be over, but some north Georgia residents still feel the holiday spirit thanks to light snowfall Friday.

[DOWNLOAD: [Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks](https://www.wsbtv.com/smart-tv/)] Although the snow was short-lived, Jasper residents said the cold and frost were welcomed. “Oh yes, I do love the snow. It’s beautiful to look at,” Jasper resident Savanna Teples told Spruill. “On my way in from work, I saw a few flurries here and there. There was a lot of ice falling instead of the flurries, not much snow.” Severe Weather Team 2 Meteorologist Jennifer Lopez said Friday morning that parts of north Georgia could see a dusting, with the highest elevations seeing up to a half inch.

It is exciting, especially with the kids being on school break. They might be able to enjoy some white cap.” Back in Jasper, the snow dipped out too soon.

    "text": "I read with great interest a letter in a newspaper the other day with the exciting topic: ‘Rediscovering the love of reading newspapers in the Digital Age’.\nThe young author, Ronald de Guzman Jr., outlines that news is everywhere and elsewhere from social media to websites, and asks: But does anyone still read newspapers in this digital age aside from the so-called “boomers”?\nAs I am a ‘boomer’ and as I am reading 4 newspapers a day and am writing weekly columns in two newspapers, I am certainly interested to hear from others how they feel about this exciting topic.\nLet me add, that I am also very much part of the digital world, hunting for special information in the Philippines and in the world. In other words, I am firmly of the opinion that people should read newspapers as hard copy and digitally.\nSomebody responded to my above question as follows:\nIn today’s fast-paced world, newspapers are facing exciting new challenges and opportunities as technology keeps evolving. The rise of the internet and digital media means that people now get their news online more than ever. So, how can newspapers adapt and thrive in this digital world?\nAlthough I only partly agree with the above opinion, let’s find out!\nGoing Online: The first step for newspapers is to embrace the internet. They can create websites and mobile apps to share news quickly with readers. This means you can check the latest updates wherever you are, right on your phone!\nI don’t agree because the printed newspaper delivers news, entertainment and lifestyle, opinion and editorials, and sport. You don’t want to miss that!!\nNews Just for You: Imagine getting news that matters to you the most, without having to search for it. Newspapers can use clever computer stuff to learn about your interests and show you news you’ll love. It’s like having your personalized newspaper!\nI want my personal newspaper in printed form, and I know exactly what to read!\nHow Do They Make Money? You might wonder how newspapers can survive if they’re putting news online for free. Well, they can offer some special content for those who subscribe, sort of like a membership. Also, they can have ads on their websites to help pay the bills.\nTrust Matters: In a world with so much information, it’s essential to know which news is reliable. Newspapers need to work hard to fact-check and provide accurate information. When you know you can trust a newspaper, you’ll keep coming back for more!\nTeaming Up for Success: Newspapers can join forces with other media and tech companies to do even better. By working together, they can share ideas, reach more people, and come up with creative solutions.\nBut people still need the printed edition every day!!!!\nIn conclusion, newspapers have a bright future ahead in the digital age. By going online, personalizing news, and using exciting content, they can stay connected with readers like never before. Remember, trustworthy news is essential, and newspapers are working hard to keep it that way. So, the next time you read a newspaper online, you’ll know they are embracing the change for the better!\nBut don’t forget the value of the printed daily newspaper that ‘flies’ into you house in the morning. I love that moment at 8 am and will never give it up!\nLet me finalize with the words of the author of the above-mentioned letter: “I remain eager to buy and read newspapers to ease my overreliance on digital media just like how I previously turned to digital to break my overreliance on newspapers.”\nIn other words: We need both!!! I really need your views; please email me at [email protected]",

    "text": "Deputados da Assembleia Legislativa de Mato Grosso do Sul aprovaram, nesta quarta-feira (16), projeto de lei que prevê a conversão de multas leves e médias em advertência. A proposta passou pela segunda votação e vai a sanção do governador Eduardo Riedel (PSDB).\nConforme reportagem do Correio do Estado, essa proposta muda pontos da Lei número 4.282, de 2012, que trata dos valores de taxas da Tabela de Serviços do Departamento Estadual de Trânsito de Mato Grosso do Sul (Detran-MS).\nConforme o texto acrescido à norma, para se livrar de possíveis multas o motorista fica condicionado a ter um bom comportamento no período de um ano, imediatamente anterior à infração observada.\nOu seja, caso não tenha cometido outra infração nos últimos 12 meses, o condutor poderá se livrar de possíveis multas de natureza média ou leve.\nIsso porque, antes de aplicar a multa, o agente fiscalizador deverá examinar o Sistema Nacional de Trânsito (SNT) sobre as informações contidas no prontuário dos condutores e veículos.\nO presidente da Casa de Leis, deputado Gerson Claro (PP) é autor do Projeto de Lei, com coautoria do deputado Paulo Duarte (PSB), que justificam a apresentação do PL \"a fim de evitar prejuízo ao direito dos condutores e a arrecadação indevida de multas que deveriam ser convertidas em advertências escritas\".\n“Existe uma previsão legal federal para a possibilidade de converter multa em advertência quando há multa de natureza de leve a média, ocorre a maioria dos Departamentos Estaduais de Trânsito [Detrans] estão fazendo isso tornar-se lei e não ser de definição do Detran, e sim, obrigatório, uma vez que for identificado no sistema somente uma multa, que seja convertida em advertência, isso passa a ser obrigatório com esse projeto”, ressaltou.\nMultas de trânsito\nPelo Código de Trânsito Brasileiro, infrações cometidas por condutores de veículos são passíveis de penalidade, que pode varia conforme a gravidade, com a seguinte classificação:\n- Leve: R$ 88,38 e 3 pontos na CNH\n- Média: R$ 130,16 e 4 pontos na CNH\n- Grave: R$ 195,23 e 5 pontos na CNH\n- Gravíssima: R$ 293,47 e 7 pontos na CNH\nAs mais diversas infrações podem gerar uma multa média, como dirigir usando fones de ouvido, não dar passagem para veículos mais rápidos, ficar sem combustível ou até mesmo jogar lixo pela janela.\nJá as multas leves são aquelas que não trazem risco imediato a segurança no trânsito, como estacionar na calçada ou acostamento, uso de buzina em lugares proibidos (como hospitais) ou ainda transitar pelas faixas que são reservadas exclusivamente para o fluxo dos ônibus.",
