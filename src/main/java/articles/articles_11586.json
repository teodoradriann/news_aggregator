    "text": "Advertisement Have You Heard Of The Partner Effect? Study Says It Could Make Or Break Your Health [By Sarah Regan](/wc/sarah-regan) If you've ever felt like your partner's health impacted yours, you probably weren't imagining things. Especially if you live together, couples share many of the same foods, lifestyles, and habits that can all impact health outcomes—including blood pressure. And according to new research published in the [Journal of the American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030765), if your partner has high blood pressure, there are some things you should know. Studying the \"partner effect\" on health outcomes For this study, researchers wanted to find out whether married couples saw similar health outcomes when it came to [blood pressure](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/eat-this-if-you-want-healthier-heart-in-2024-study-says), looking at couples from four different countries. Namely, they analyzed the blood pressure of 3,989 U.S. couples, 1,086 English couples, 6,514 Chinese couples, and 22,389 Indian couples. (Note: All the couples were heterosexual.) And based on what they found, the \"partner effect\" is very much real; When one partner had high blood pressure, the other was more likely to have it, too. In some instances, both partners had high blood pressure—47% in England, 38% in the U.S., 21% in China, and 20% in India. And compared to women with husbands who [didn't have high blood pressure](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/beet-juice-benefits), women whose husbands did have high blood pressure were more likely to have it. (9% more likely in England and the U.S., and 19% and 26% more likely in India and China, respectively.) As senior study author Chihua Li, Ph.D. explains in a news release, \"Many people know that high blood pressure is common in middle-aged and older adults, yet we were surprised to find that among many older couples, both husband and wife had high blood pressure in the U.S., England, China and India. For instance, in the U.S., among more than 35% of couples who were ages 50 or older, both had high blood pressure.\" How to leverage the partner effect for better results According to Li, these findings not only demonstrate how we can unwittingly influence our partner's health—and vice versa—but highlight the importance of couple-centered approaches to combatting high blood pressure (i.e. getting screened together or eating healthier meals together). \"Following this idea,\" adds associate professor and epidemiology expert Bethany Barone Gibbs, Ph.D., \"making lifestyle changes, such as being more active, reducing stress, or eating a healthier diet, can all reduce blood pressure; however, these changes may be difficult to achieve and, more importantly, sustain if your spouse or partner (and greater family unit) are not making changes with you.\" So whether you're trying to [lower your blood pressure](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-lower-resting-heart-rate), or your partner is trying to lower theirs, you might want to join forces and tackle your health goals as a team. Here's our [full guide on how to talk to your partner about their health](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-to-say-when-your-partner-isnt-taking-care-of-their-health) if you need some advice on that front. The takeaway High blood pressure is a huge health burden all around the world—but it can be prevented. And if you're partnered up, according to these findings, [getting your significant other on board](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/characteristics-of-healthy-relationships) with your health goals could be the missing piece of the puzzle to help you both feel your best in 2024.

    "text": "Water is at the heart of reconciliation with Canada’s Indigenous Peoples. Access to clean water is recognized as a human right. Without water, people suffer grievously. When one group has reliable water supplies and others go without safe drinking water for years it is impossible to see equity and fairness in society. Ken Coates is a distinguished fellow and the director of Indigenous affairs at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. Handout photograph There have been flashes of national interest in water matters, especially when there are disasters or crises. These concerns have proved transitory despite constant interventions by environmental groups. Canadians, with the world’s largest supply of fresh water, take this precious resource for granted. The federal government has removed most of the drinking water advisories in Indigenous communities. But it is distressing that it took generations to listen to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit complaints about the management of water. Water has become one of the most prominent symbols of the gap in quality of life and services between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples, and between rich and poor. The management of water remains a standing indictment of fundamental inequities in the country. Indigenous Peoples have strong commitments to water quality and sustainability. The Idle No More Movement that swept across Canada in 2012 and 2013 started, in substantial measure, over changes to federal water management legislation that loosened regulations over water use and quality. Protection of water systems underlies almost every Indigenous opposition to resource and infrastructure development. While these issues should be of great concern to all Canadians, they strike at the heart of Indigenous social, cultural, and ecological sustainability. As northern scholar Catharine McClellan wrote of northern Indigenous Peoples, they are “part of the land, part of the water.” Most Canadians, in contrast, see water as a consumable resource. The country needs to listen to Indigenous Peoples more broadly on water matters. The First Nations and Métis of Cumberland House, Sask., led by the late Gary Carriere, agitated for years to draw attention to the near collapse of the Saskatchewan River Delta due to upstream farm run-off, effluent disposal and water diversion to major cities. That the prosperity of Calgary, central Alberta, and much of Saskatchewan rests on the rapid deterioration of North America’s largest inland delta warrants urgent attention. There are few greater examples of the seriousness of Canada’s water issues and the unwillingness to take measures to correct a water-based ecological disaster. Things move much faster when non-Indigenous communities are affected. The government of Alberta, alarmed by the declining snowpack in the Rocky Mountains this winter, has accelerated region-wide water planning. There are legitimate fears of a 1930s-type drought, with resulting impacts on communities and industries across Western Canada. This kind of resilience and disaster planning—sure to become more common as climate change continues—will no doubt emphasize urban and commercial uses. It stands in sharp contrast to the much slower response to Indigenous and rural water problems. Comparable scenarios are playing out across the country, from the downstream impacts of the Site C dam in northern British Columbia to the ongoing water challenges in Iqaluit, Nunavut. Water is only part of the challenge. Debates over Indigenous water quality are symptoms of much broader shortcomings in Canada’s approach to environmental and Indigenous issues. Canadians managed to roust themselves after the 2005 E. coli water crisis in Kashechewan First Nation in Ontario, leading to a substantial effort to improve water quality on reserves. There has been no such urgency for long-term poverty, food insecurity, over-crowded and decrepit housing, or widespread opioid abuse in remote Indigenous communities. Water, at least, motivates the government and the public to act. But Canada’s approach to both water and Indigenous affairs—more closely linked than most realize—cannot be driven solely by crises. Both require long-term planning, close collaboration with Indigenous communities, empowerment of Indigenous governments, and a sharper focus on the human-environment interaction. Ideally, the government can turn water management from a symbol of national failings to a sign of Canadian resilience, responsiveness, and cross-cultural understanding.

    "text": "Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, released a strong\nend-of-year report showing growth in customers despite massive fines being levied against the company in the U.S. and the November resignation of its CEO and co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who pled guilty in the U.S. to a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act and is awaiting trial in February.\nBinance said it saw an influx in 2023 of 40 million users, growing its customer base by 30% to 170 million registered users. Its peer-to-peer platform, where users directly trade crypto with other Binance users, processed 18% more trades than last year, and served 39% more users.\nBinance’s proof-of-reserves system holding crypto in reserve for customers increased the number of supported assets from nine in 2022 to 31 in 2023.\nThe crypto exchange reported spending $213 million in 2023 on compliance technology, processes, and talent, up 35% from last year.\nGovernance Changes\nPutting a positive spin on its legal troubles and chief executive’s woes, Binance wrote, “This year, our organization took responsibility for historical issues and has evolved through leadership change, emerging from it an even stronger business.” The company described changes to its governance, including that “[a] board of at least three independent directors, accountable to all stakeholders, will be the steward and governing body of the organization.”\nFinally, it noted that “U.S. agencies did not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, or engaged in any market manipulation.”\nEarlier in December, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ordered Binance and Zhao to pay a combined\n$2.7 billion in fines to the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission for violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.\nThat follows a November settlement in which Binance agreed to a\n$4.3 billion fine to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation, and Zhao agreed to step down as CEO. However, the legal battle between Binance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still remains unresolved.",

    "text": "- Verastem Oncology (\nVSTM,Financial) receives FDA clearance for Investigational New Drug application of VS-7375, an oral KRAS G12D inhibitor. - The Phase 1/2a U.S. trial for VS-7375 is set to commence in mid-2025, focusing on advanced solid tumors.\n- Initial trial data will be presented at the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting, providing insights into safety and efficacy.\nVerastem Oncology (VSTM), a leading biopharmaceutical company specializing in treatments for RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers, has announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of their Investigational New Drug (IND) application for VS-7375. This oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor is set to enter a Phase 1/2a trial targeting advanced solid tumors, including pancreatic, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers, by mid-2025.\nThe upcoming U.S. trial aims to build on the promising initial safety and efficacy results demonstrated in studies conducted by GenFleet Therapeutics in China. Verastem plans to explore multiple expansion cohorts within the trial, further assessing VS-7375's effectiveness both as a standalone treatment and in combination with other therapies.\nMoreover, an abstract detailing the dose escalation phase of the Phase 1/2 study by GenFleet will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in 2025. The data, under embargo until May 22, 2025, promises to offer a comprehensive update on VS-7375's clinical potential, showcasing initial bioavailability and significant patient responses in combatting KRAS G12D mutant solid tumors.\nAccording to Dan Paterson, CEO of Verastem Oncology, \"The dual inhibition attribute of VS-7375 potentially enhances its efficacy compared to existing KRAS G12D-selective agents, suggesting improved and durable cancer response outcomes.” Verastem’s collaboration with GenFleet supports three oncology programs, marking a significant stride in their mission to develop innovative cancer treatments.",

    "text": "Part of Kingston Lane, a street adjacent to the beach in Ventura, Calif., was flooded after the high surf breached the area.\nSAN FRANCISCO — Giant waves pounded the coast of California on Thursday, causing big headaches, closing beaches and toppling some people who watched the unusual waterfront show.\nWaves topping 30 feet broke onto shores up and down the state, prompting stark warnings, such as one from the National Weather Service’s Bay Area division: “The ocean is NOT your friend today!”\nHigh surf warnings remain in effect through early Friday, the Weather Service said, and waves surpassing 40 feet are possible. The coastal unrest was caused by a series of storms with hurricane-force winds brewing over the Pacific Ocean, pushing big swells toward the state.\n“Stay away from rocks, jetties, piers, and other waterside infrastructure,” the Weather Service added. “Never turn your back to the ocean!”\nNot everybody took the warnings to heart. A much-shared video on X showed little kids being pummeled by a big wave that threw them to the ground as they watched the surge on West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz, 75 miles south of San Francisco. The children appeared shocked but fine as the water receded.\nIt seemed fitting that California could not escape 2023 without one final bout of extraordinary weather phenomena after a year that delivered torrential rainstorms, blizzards in Southern California mountains, a rare tropical storm and the re-emergence of an ancient lake.\nFarther down the coast in Ventura, a beach town south of Santa Barbara, Brandt Hammer, 60, was cleaning up Thursday afternoon after waves surged into residential streets and flooded some homes. The water carried sand and debris with it, blocking storm drains.\nMr. Hammer and his wife moved to Kingston Lane, which runs right up to the beach, after their previous house nearby burned down in the Thomas fire in 2017.\n“We always said the only thing we have to worry about now is tsunamis,” he said with a laugh. “A lady who’s lived here 30 years said she’s never seen it like this.”\nIn one instance, a wave was powerful enough to crash over a beach wall, knock over adults and propel a truck down a road. Eight people were hospitalized with minor injuries from that wave alone, according to Andy VanSciver, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department, which posted a video of the incident on X. Ten people were rescued from the water countywide, he said.\nBecky Clearwater said she walked on Thursday from her home in Ventura to the beach to survey the storm surge and was surprised to see its consistency and strength.\n“It was wave after wave after wave,” she said.\nThe waves destroyed a bench etched with the names of 20 dogs that neighbors had lost over the years, she said.\n“It’s been our little thing for a long time, and we lost it today,” she said. “It’s gone, but we’ve already got plans in the works to build another one.”\nIn Stinson Beach, a coastal town about 20 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge, the local Fire Department ordered the evacuation of several small roads near the beach because of a high risk of damage from waves and coastal flooding. Residents and visitors were told to “evacuate immediately for life safety,” and a community center was converted into an evacuation point. The order was lifted later in the day.\nHeather Vantress, the owner of Sandpiper Lodging at the Beach, said she noticed that the tide appeared very high on her morning drive to the hotel, but that her business was not affected because it was high enough above the shore.\nThursday’s waves, she said, were nothing compared with the repeated battering of the town last winter, when California was hit by a series of atmospheric rivers.\n“Last year, it was so bad people were freaking out — that was way worse,” she said. “The beach got really destroyed last year, but it all came back.”\nOfficials in Santa Cruz County warned residents to prepare to evacuate near Seacliff State Beach, not far from where intense waves tore a house off its foundations in January. On Thursday, crews elsewhere cleared debris scattered onto the shoreline highway by the ocean, and several car turnouts near area beaches were closed. Some streets in the area were flooded.\nBut the storm surge brought excitement, too — at least among the big wave surfers who were out at Mavericks, the famous surf break off the coast of Half Moon Bay, a town 30 miles south of San Francisco.\nA local surf camera measured waves at “XXL,” noting that they ranged from 30 to 40 feet high. Crowds of people lined the cliffs to watch the surfing spectacle.\nAs residents cleaned up in Ventura, they were aware that more storm conditions and big waves were expected on Friday.\n“I’m more worried about tomorrow,” Mr. Hammer said.",
