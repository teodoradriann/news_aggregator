    "text": "In a perfect world, teachers would be just as well-known and beloved as big-name actors.\nWell, two Maryland teachers, Maggie Arnold from Fredrick High and Bradley Absher from Bodkin Elementary School, got the red carpet treatment today.\nBoth classroom heroes won the \"Oscar\" of education, the Milken Educator Award, which was created in 1987 to recognize excellent instructors.\nThe winners don't get just a shiny new trophy or blue ribbon.\nThey receive a whopping $25,000 check with an all expenses paid trip to Los Angeles with other Milken winners.\nArnold immigrated to the U.S. as a kid, and eventually fell in love with teaching. Her students see her as the perfect balance of demanding and encouraging.\nAbsher is known for his hands-on, creative approach. For example, he teaches his kids how to multiply fractions with the end result of creating a “No Bake Cheescake.”\nBefore they begin the main lesson, he gets students number engines revved up through his “Number Talks” warm-up lesson.\nWith teachers like Arnold and Absher leading the way, Maryland's future is bright.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

El residente de Israel logró milagrosamente salirse con la suya. Uno de los militares acabó haciéndose una foto con la mujer y saliendo de la casa. \"Dije: 'vengo del país de [Messi](https://tribuna.com/es/persons/lionel-messi/)'\", reveló más tarde a los medios. Sin embargo, dos de sus nietos fueron secuestrados. Hamás toma rehenes como póliza de seguro contra las represalias israelíes. También los utilizan como moneda de cambio para intercambios de prisioneros... y como herramienta de propaganda. Seguramente esta noticia no puede calificarse de positiva, pero al menos sabemos que Lionel Messi ha salvado una vida más. 0 Últimas noticias Noticias populares La Liga Clasificación №EquipoPJPT 12766 22759 32758 42755 52750 62742 72740 82737 92637 102736 112735 122732 132729 142727 152727 162726 172724 182719 192614 20279 PJ: Partidos JugadosPT: Puntos Mejores Jugadores DEPORTISTA G A 14 5 14 2 G: GolesA: Asistencias",

    "text": "FALMOUTH, Maine — For many young musicians, recording in a professional studio can feel out of reach. As a singer-songwriter himself, Aedan MacDougall understands this firsthand. \"Studios can be so expensive,\" MacDougall explained. \"It can be $1,000 a day or more.\" But MacDougall and many other artists have found a creative sanctuary at Monaco Studios in Falmouth. Once a private home studio for Portland native Sam Monaco, it has been transformed into a hub for artists looking to hone their craft. After offering student discounts and seeing the impacts lowering cost-barriers can be, Monaco then founded the nonprofit Equal Measure Arts to continue that success. RELATED: Mobile Art Bus providing activities to families as a therapeutic outlet The nonprofit offers scholarships and mentoring through grants and community donations. Applications for its scholarships open in January 2025. The result is a judgement-free space for musicians and artists of all experience levels. \"Like, 'no dumb questions' kind of thing,\" Monaco added. \"Come in here if you want to learn about the process. We're happy to share our knowledge.\" RELATED: Where do songwriters get their inspiration? Sometimes the songs just pour out of them For artists like MacDougall, the impact has been immense. \"I've made a whole record here and have recorded a bunch of singles,\" he said. The nonprofit has already garnered support through community donations, allowing Monaco to continue nurturing the southern Maine music scene he grew up loving. \"It's really gratifying to come back as an adult and be able to give something back that can really sustain it into the future,\" Monaco shared.",

    "text": "Estos robots me han demostrado que no me hacía falta gastar tanto para tener mi casa limpia\nSe habla mucho de la gama media en el mundo de la telefonía. Pero también contamos con un segmento similar en el sector de los robots aspiradores repleto de posibilidades\nLos robots aspiradores son hoy en día casi un elemento más de infinidad de hogares, aunque no siempre fue así. Hubo un tiempo en el que tener uno era algo bastante exclusivo y, por tanto, reservado a unos pocos bolsillos pudientes. No solo eso: casi se podía considerar además un capricho caro y algo tonto, ya que ni mucho menos alcanzaba la eficacia de los modelos actuales.\nEste salto cualitativo lo hemos presenciado en las propuestas más ambiciosas de los fabricantes, con tecnologías que, por suerte, también han ido saltando a gamas más accesibles con cada actualización de catálogo.\nEsa navegación láser de última generación o la posibilidad de secar la mopa tras el fregado ya no son cosas de los modelos con etiquetas prohibitivas que superan las cuatro cifras, de forma que ahora es posible encontrar propuestas muy equilibradas a un precio mucho más accesible.\nYo reconozco que no tenía mucha fe en eso que podríamos llamar la gran gama media de los robots aspiradores, pero tanto Roborock como iRobot me han demostrado que no siempre hay que tener lo último de lo último para acabar satisfecha con la limpieza de mi hogar. Te cuento por qué.\nRoborock QV 35A\nAtrás quedó la (desfasada) idea de que iRobot es la única capaz de hacer buenos robots aspiradores. A base de esfuerzo y un catálogo repleto de modelos, Roborock se ha convertido en otro de los grandes referentes a la hora de pensar en la compra de uno, proponiendo desde ideas increíblemente avanzadas -es la responsable del famoso robot con brazo- a propuestas bastante humildes que no sobrepasan los 300 euros.\nJusto en medio de estos dos extremos tenemos la QV 35A. Tras este nombre tan horrible -me vas a permitir que me queje porque me parece nada pegadizo y difícil de memorizar- se encuentra un modelo que no deja de ser una Qrevo S mejorada. Así lo indica el propio fabricante en su web, presentándonos un modelo con base de carga y autovaciado bastante interesante a nivel de prestaciones y rendimiento.\nCon una potencia de 8.000 Pa (frente a los 7.000 de la Qrevo S, entre otras pequeñas diferencias), la QV 35A ofrece todas las prestaciones que hoy en día cualquiera desea para su casa: es capaz de aspirar todo el polvo, viene con mopas giratorias que friegan y son autolavables, disfruta de navegación PreciSense LiDAR, cuenta con cepillo de goma y sistema ant enredos, ofrece tecnología de evitación de obstáculos y su base vacía el polvo automáticamente, llena el tanque del robot de agua y vacía también lo sucio para estar lista para la siguiente tarea, sin que tú tengas que hacer prácticamente nada.\nTe adelanto ya que es increíblemente eficiente en todas estas funciones. El Roborock se ha paseado por mi casa con una soltura pasmosa -tras un mapeo previo con el que ha reconocido todas las estancias sorprendentemente bien-, recogiendo la suciedad de manera eficaz y ofreciendo un buen resultado también a la hora de pasar sus mopas rotatorias.\nEvidentemente, en este buen hacer influyen varios factores. Uno de ellos es un sistema de navegación bastante efectivo, que hace que prácticamente no se golpee con nada y que elige siempre la mejor manera de moverse por el área de trabajo. Otro elemento determinante es su app móvil. A través de ella es posible controlar todo tipo de aspectos que van más allá de la simple programación de horarios.\nA través de una interfaz bastante intuitiva, clara y directa, Roborock permite que decidamos con unos simples toques si queremos una limpieza de toda la casa, por habitaciones o por zonas, además de permitir siempre elegir si deseamos aspirar y fregar, solo fregar o solo aspirar. Todas estas acciones se pueden además personalizar por niveles (desde potencia silenciosa a máximo en el caso de la aspiración; y de un nivel de agua que puede ser bajo, medio o máximo o incluso un nivel específico que va de 0 a 30, según elijas) y/o estancias (elegir que en la cocina use más agua y menos en el dormitorio de los niños), además de pedir a la propia app que decida cuál es la mejor manera de limpiar gracias a su SmartPlan.\nLas opciones de personalización no acaban aquí. Podrás señalar el tipo de suelo de cada habitación (incluso la orientación de las lamas) o qué quieres que haga el robot al encontrar una alfombra (que la evite, que la cruce, que ponga el modo turbo o no, que eleve la mopa para no mojarla…), decidir cada cuánto quieres que la mopa vuelva a la base de carga durante su trabajo para refrescarse, y hasta el modo de colisión ante obstáculos (puedes estar interesado en que minimice los impactos aunque el coste a pagar es áreas alrededor de patas de mesas y sillas sin limpiar). Podría estar un buen rato enumerando todas las opciones de la app de Roborock, pero posiblemente ya te haya transmitido mi fascinación acerca de una de las aplicaciones de robot de aspiradores más completas que existen a mi parecer.\nSe podría decir por tanto que es difícil diferenciarla de un tope de gama como puede ser una S8 MaxV Ultra o la Saros 10R, aunque, evidentemente, existen diferencias. Otra cosa es que a ti te importen, claro. La QV por ejemplo no tiene dispensador de detergente automático, como sí tiene la MaxV ni cuenta con doble cepillo principal. En lugar de una mopa de fregado sónico, emplea los comentados rodillos giratorios y en cuanto al diseño, pues hay otros materiales en juego. Tendrás que olvidarte de las elegantes bases de la S8 o la Saros -¿recuerdas el bonito acabado espejo que tiene?- para abrazar una estética más sencilla y discreta, con materiales que se sienten (digamos que) menos caros.\nEsto tampoco es un drama, oye. A fin de cuentas un robot aspirador es lo que es y si lo tienes estratégicamente colocado en casa, sin que tenga que estar a la vista de nadie, poco te importa que su torre sea de plástico o puedas mirarte todas las mañanas en su reflejo.\nA cambio, eso sí, te gastas considerablemente menos, concretamente 499,99 euros, que es lo que cuesta ahora mismo la QV 35A -en nuestra ficha de producto, unas líneas más arriba, puedes comprar incluso más barata- y que me parece más que justo para todas las maravillas que ofrece… y lo limpia que ha dejado mi casa.\niRobot Roomba Plus 505 Combo con Base AutoWash\n¿Qué decirte de iRobot que no sepas ya? La firma responsable del concepto “Roomba” (posiblemente el término más utilizado para referirse generícamente a todos los robots aspiradores) continúa firme en su posición como una de esas marcas que siempre me ha transmitido confianza y la sensación de que nunca voy a estar haciendo una mala compra con ella. Es lo que tiene llevar tanto tiempo en el mercado con propuestas siempre bastante resolutivas y su Roomba Plus 505 Combo con Base Autowash no es una excepción.\nLo primero que llama la atención -y te lo garantizo porque me lo han comentado varias personas al venir a casa- es su diseño. La Roomba Plus 505 es bonita. Y eso no admite discusión. La base cuenta con un panel texturizado, que también luce la tapa superior del robot, que le da un toque premium bastante resultón. Me hubiera encantado que dicha estructura se alargara hacia arriba hasta tapar visualmente los dos tanques de agua (sucia y limpia), ya que creo que hubiera sido la guinda del pastel, pero en líneas generales, como digo, su aspecto la hace lucir muy de alta gama, apostando por detalles como, por ejemplo, una placa metálica con el nombre de la marca en el lateral.\nA nivel de rendimiento le puedo poner muy pocas pegas, por no decir ninguna. El robot aspira de manera efectiva, disfrutando de una escobilla ideal para las esquinas, y friega también de manera sobresaliente. Me gusta muchísimo que una de sus mopas sea capaz de estirarse para acercarse mejor a los bordes (a esto el fabricante lo ha bautizado como PerfectEdge) y es cierto que evita obstáculos con bastante eficacia (me ha sorprendido a veces con juguetes muy pequeños de mis hijos). Imposible ponerle pegas. También es verdad que a la hora de limpiar las mopas es un pelín más ruidosa por ejemplo que la Roborock, pero ni siquiera lo consideraría un defecto destacable.\nEl problema lo encuentro en su aplicación móvil. iRobot decidió recientemente actualizar su catálogo y con ello renovar su app, pero no actualizando la que ya tenía sino lanzando una nueva, iRobot Home -algo que de base ya me parece algo confuso para los que sean usuarios de la marca. Su planteamiento tiene ideas interesantes, pero me parece que a nivel de ejecución y de interfaz de usuario, no han sabido resolver la papeleta como toca. Para empezar, tenemos por un lado la sección Robot, en la que puedes consultar el estado del mismo o manejar los controles de su base (vaciar depósito, detener secado de la mopa…), pero luego si quieres ordenar una limpieza y personalizarla, debes irte a otra pestaña llamada “Mi hogar”, lo que me parece que ralentiza un poco la experiencia.\nPor no hablar de que a la hora de editar el mapa de casa hay que dedicarle un rato. No me ha pasado en otras funciones y es cierto que una vez hecho, es raro que vuelvas a editar el mapa de tu hogar, pero debo contarte que tras el primer mapeo, a la hora de fusionar espacios, establecer divisiones o simplemente renombrar habitaciones, me he encontrado con una aplicación algo más lenta de lo deseable y que tardaba más segundos de los esperados para guardar cualquier cambio. Creo por tanto que la app necesita en líneas generales un ajuste de tuercas para hacerla más accesible, rápida e intuitiva para el usuario.\nAun con esta experiencia un poco más tibia por la parte de software, es indudable que la Roomba Plus 505 Combo sigue siendo una opción muy interesante y que no va a dejarte mal sabor de boca en términos de limpieza. El robot ejecuta sus tareas con solvencia, su estación es visualmente muy atractiva y no dudo que una futura renovación de su app terminará por redondear la propuesta. Los 599 euros que cuesta en estos momentos (incluso puedes encontrarla por 549 euros en color blanco) me siguen pareciendo justificables para todas las prestaciones y tecnologías que ofrece.\nComo te comentaba, iRobot decidió actualizar recientemente su catálogo y eso me ha permitido probar otro modelo de la casa que me sirve como excusa perfecta para proponerte una alternativa más barata a la QV 35A y a la propia Roomba Plus 505 Combo. Me refiero a la Roomba 205 DustCompactor que es toda una alegoría al back to basic.\nAquí nos olvidamos de bases imposibles que ocupan un buen espacio en cualquier punto de casa para regresar a las estaciones de antaño, esos puestos de reducido volumen que prácticamente se pueden esconder en cualquier rincón. Y, ojo, porque eso no significa que tengas que estar vaciando su bolsa de manera frecuente. La gracia de esta propuesta es que cuenta con un depósito interno con una pala que recoge y compacta el polvo, de forma que puedes almacenar suciedad durante 60 días - llevo probándola desde principios de junio y aún no he tenido que vaciarla.\nEvidentemente, aquí no contamos ni con llenado automático de agua ni vaciado, aunque sí podemos acoplarle una mopa que lleva el propio tanque incorporado (como imaginarás la capacidad es más bien limitada), pero que te hará perfectamente el apaño para un mantenimiento húmedo del suelo de la casa.\nY lo mejor, claro, es su precio: por 299 euros (en color negro, ya que la blanca está algo más cara), te olvidas de tanto cacharro y regresas a la limpieza más sencilla sin que eso implique demasiada servidumbre por tu parte.\nEn realidad, confieso que he hecho algo de trampas para llamar tu atención: sí sabía desde hace un tiempo que no hace falta gastar tanto en un robot aspirador porque en su momento tuve la oportunidad de probar la Vacuum X20 Pro de Xiaomi y me dejó encantada. Este equipo sigue siendo una alternativa interesante con una ficha ténica muy atractiva y un precio difícil de rechazar.\nEn un rango de precios similares se mueve la popular Dreame L10s Ultra Gen 2. Tras este nombre tan largo se esconde un superventas con 10.000 Pa de potencia, vaciado automático de polvo, lavado automático de mopa (con secado incluido), llenado automático de agua y una app llena de opciones.\n______________",

    "title": "«La capacité d'attention est courte. Les gens veulent ce coup de dopamine » : Jordan Adetunji, le garçon de Belfast en quête de gloire aux Grammys | Pop et rock",
    "text": "Depuis Belfast\nRecommandé si vous aimez Drake, Bryson Tiller, Cash Cobain\nÀ suivre Nouvelle musique attendue début 2025\nParmi les légendes telles que Beyoncé, Future, the Weeknd et Erykah Badu parmi les nominés pour le Grammy de la meilleure performance de rap mélodique de cette année se trouve Jordan Adetunji ( photo ci-dessus ), un jeune de 25 ans originaire de Belfast. Alors que l’Académie s’en remet à Beyoncé presque à chaque occasion, Adetunji pourrait l’attraper avec quelque chose qu’il a fabriqué dans sa chambre.\nSon brillant morceau de deux minutes, Kehlani, a l’immédiateté et l’instinct d’un single punk, alors qu’Adetunji se faufile autour de tambours sourds pour chanter une série de lignes de discussion : « J’aime la façon dont ton corps est, est-ce trop évident ? OK, j’aime ta confiance » – dans une mélodie désarmante et palpitante. Il compare son objet d’amour à la star du R&B Kehlani et donne son nom à la chanson. « J’avais deux idées : comment va-t-elle prendre ça ? Est-ce trop ? dit-il lors d’un appel téléphonique depuis Belfast. “Mais je voulais vraiment faire une chanson avec elle – je voulais vraiment qu’elle la voie !”\nLe morceau a explosé sur TikTok avant même d’être terminé, après qu’Adetunji ait chanté le travail en cours à ses abonnés – une tactique courante pour lui. « TikTok est à la fois un outil créatif et un outil A&R : parfois je teste mes accroches là-dessus et je vois ce que les gens aiment », dit-il. “Il y a peut-être quelque chose dont je ne suis pas sûr et ensuite je l’ai publié [on TikTok] et les gens l’adorent et ça me fait l’aimer davantage.\nUne fois terminé, Kehlani a ensuite décollé dans le monde entier, atteignant le Top 10 britannique au cours d’une période de 20 semaines. Kehlani elle-même l’a inévitablement entendu et a appelé Adetunji pour lui demander de faire un remix. « Elle m’a dit : tu dois m’envoyer les fichiers » – mais Adetunji était par ailleurs disposé au milieu d’une discothèque de Dublin. « Je me dis : putain ! J’essaie de téléphoner à mon frère au milieu de ce club pour l’envoyer. Heureusement, j’avais une version dans laquelle il n’y avait pas d’autres versets, alors je l’ai envoyée, mais c’était stressant. J’ai eu beaucoup de chance. Vous manifestez quelque chose – et alors cela prend vraiment vie.\nCela a été un moment décisif pour Adetunji, qui fait de la musique depuis son adolescence après avoir déménagé de Londres à Belfast avec sa mère nigériane à l’âge de 10 ans. « Je suis passé de tous les autres étant de couleur dans la même classe à celui d’être le seul enfant noir. C’était intéressant. Mais tout le monde m’a apprécié et était vraiment gentil. Il s’est inspiré de l’ambiance « en rupture avec les règles » de la scène musicale de sa nouvelle ville et d’une diffusion remarquable d’artistes qu’il a découverts en ligne et dans les jeux vidéo, de l’Afropop de l’héritage de sa mère à Joy Division, Drake et les rockers industriels Static. -X.\nIl coproduit une grande partie de sa musique, qui présente l’aveuglement du genre si commun à sa génération. Oli Sykes, le leader des pop-metallers Bring Me the Horizon, a été impressionné par la chanson post-punk 2020 d’Adetunji, Wokeup! et l’a brandi sous le nez de ses patrons de RCA Records, qui ont signé Adetunji (il a depuis rejoint un autre label majeur, Warner). La mixtape 2023 Rock’n’Rave s’est avérée plus rave que rock, penchant vers le club jersey, la trap et la danse africaine.\nSes morceaux ne dépassent presque jamais la barre des trois minutes et durent souvent moins de deux, conformément à une tendance plus large du rap. « La consommation de contenu [online] a rendu la capacité d’attention des gens plus courte », explique Adetunji. «Ils recherchent immédiatement cette dose de dopamine. Mais j’ai l’impression qu’une fois que les gens deviennent fans, ils sont prêts à approfondir ce sujet.\nIl dit que son nouveau matériel à venir s’articule davantage autour du son de Kehlani – un genre surnommé « sexy drill » – et se concentre sur le drame relationnel. Il ne se laissera pas impressionner par les détails – « L’amour est grand ! » – mais admet qu’une rupture antérieure a fini par booster sa carrière : « Cela m’a simplement rendu plus concentré et m’a donné envie de sortir plus de musique. J’ai pu sortir de cette situation et reprendre le contrôle de ma propre vie.\nIl a déjà sorti un single post-Kehlani, Options, avec l’un des plus grands noms du rap américain, Lil Baby – ils ont tourné une vidéo ensemble sur un yacht à Miami. “Je ne pense pas pouvoir exprimer à quel point ce type est gentil”, dit Adetunji. “Il m’a dit : continue, garde le pied sur l’accélérateur, c’est de ça qu’il s’agit.” Je me demande à voix haute si c’est un conseil intimidant, étant donné le rythme impitoyable de la pop déficitaire d’attention d’aujourd’hui. “Naaah”, dit-il en souriant. «Ça fait du bien. Je sais que je peux avoir un impact – parce que j’ai maintenant un public.\n#capacité #dattention #est #courte #Les #gens #veulent #coup #dopamine #Jordan #Adetunji #garçon #Belfast #quête #gloire #aux #Grammys #Pop #rock",
