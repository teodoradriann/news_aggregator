Les manifestants réclament notamment une extension de l'appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) pour inclure des règles protégeant l'embouteillage local, sur le modèle du champagne.\n\"Nous allons saisir le Bureau national interprofessionnel du cognac (BNIC) pour faire évoluer le cahier des charges. Aujourd'hui, l'AOC ne protège pas l'embouteillage local, il faut que cela change\", explique Matthieu Devers, délégué CGT Hennessy.\n\"Si le BNIC prend cette décision, on pourra protéger notre AOC de A à Z\", affirme Tommy Dupuis. \"Le cognac, c'est chez nous et ça doit rester chez nous\", abonde Gladys Decou, employée sur la chaîne d'embouteillage.\nD'autres redoutent des conséquences économiques désastreuses pour la région. \"Si les lignes de production sont déplacées, je vais perdre mon emploi, les autres aussi, et le bassin de Cognac va devenir une ville morte.\nIl ne faut pas laisser faire ça\", s'alarme Alex Barbin, chauffeur chez Hennessy depuis 15 ans. L'inquiétude gagne aussi les commerçants locaux. \"L'impact sur la ville, le tourisme et tous les commerces serait très préoccupant\", estime Mylène Personyre, hôtelière à Cognac.\nCette mobilisation intervient alors que le Premier ministre Michel Barnier prévoit une visite prochaine en Chine pour discuter des surtaxes imposées par Pékin, perçues comme une riposte à une procédure similaire de Bruxelles sur les voitures électriques produites en Chine et vendues dans l'Union européenne.\n(Avec AFP)",

    "text": "Southern Sydney's Jody Mielke has set a huge challenge for herself early in the new year to raise some money for cancer research. It's not unusual for the Australian Mountain bike champ to challenge herself and others around her and has chosen to support friends like Luke Callum and many others with pancreatic cancer. Jody aims to ride from the Cyclery Studio in Kirrawee to Thredbo which is about 600kms to complete at the Thredbo Cannonball Festival, a week long Gravity Mountain Bike event. She is riding down to Thredbo on a gravel bike, which is half mountain bike- half road bike. Known to dress up on random occasions up she may even ride in her purple Carebear outfit which she sometimes wears for the Pancare foundation - which she will wear on the final days Downhill event. Jody and her friend Luke Callum have been working together in the bike industry for over 25 years - Luke is 45 years old, married, has three kids and has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Jody is supported on the ride by Sydney based Dharko clothing who is sending a support vehicle with her and will give away product, Bexon Crane Rail and Roof Tech a Shire tradesman are also helping out. Jody also has a friend who has done all her off road maps to ensure she gets to her destination safely and on time. \"My bike is called Goldilocks (it has gold taped handlebars) so I don't want to get lost in the bush,\" she said She leaves on Thursday 8th February. where she will ride road and dirt bikes to Nowra, then Nowra to Braidwood, Braidwood to Cooma, Cooma to Thredbo. Jody then gets one day to recover before the five days of the Cannonball Festival. Jody said she will hike to the top of the race start for every mountain bike run she does - and there are five events. \"Just to add to the challenge and raise as much funds and awareness as possible I will be hiking to the top of Thredbo each day for my race runs down the mountain. \"I will not disappoint and be in dress up costumes for each event too. I love supporting people in need as I'm healthy enough to do this. \"Everyone has someone with cancer close to them and if we can do our bit to help in any way possible I'm in,\" she said \"I'm fundraising for Pancare Foundation to make a difference to the lives of those affected by upper gastrointestinal cancers - pancreatic, liver, stomach, biliary and oesophageal cancers,\" she said \"Each year, over 13,000 Australians are diagnosed with these cancers and with some of the lowest survival rates out of all the major cancers, we must act now to fund research which has the potential to deliver breakthroughs in treatment and care - ultimately saving lives. \"This is going to hurt me, the training has been bad enough -I just want to raise as much as I can for others Im not trying to win the world title.\" To support Jody's epic ride : https://pancare-gi-cancer.raisely.com/jody-mielke Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "text": "Nano-priming is an emerging application of nanotechnology in agriculture intending to increase crop yield and nutritional quality, while reducing fertilizer applications. This study aimed to investigate the effects of seed priming with citrate-coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) suspensions (10, 20, and 40 mg NPs L− 1) on the life cycle of the Phaseolus vulgaris L. OTI cultivar and evaluate the technology costs. The effect of nano-priming was assessed in the germination, flowering, and harvest stages. Unprimed and hydro-primed seeds were negative and positive controls, respectively. Nano-priming with CoFe2O4 NPs had no effect neither on the germination nor on plant nutrition (in the flowering stage) of OTI beans compared to unprimed and hydro-primed seeds. In contrast, nitrogenase activity (343.3 ± 1.1 µmol h− 1 plant− 1 of C2H4 ) was detected in the plants from the 40 mg kg− 1 nano-primed seeds. The K concentration of progeny seeds from nano-priming with 10, 20, and 40 mg NPs L− 1 increased significantly by 3%, 16%, and 13% compared to the control seeds. The Zn concentration in the seeds from nano-priming with 10 mg NPs L− 1 was 27% higher than in the control and 28% higher than in the hydro-primed seeds. When nano-priming with 40 mg NPs L− 1, the Zn concentration was 5% and 6% higher than the control and hydro-primed seeds. The calculated cost of nano-priming seeds per ha ranged from 121 to 143 USD. In this regard, nano-priming of bean seeds with citrate-coated CoFe2O4 NPs could be a low-cost approach to achieve nutritional security and agricultural sustainability.",

    "text": "Hanging out with his young son inside is exactly where Jaylin Harris wants to be, especially with weather like this. “It was very cold,\" Harris said. \"As soon as I walked outside, hands instantly got cold.” Harris just moved back from Arizona and his son is now a kindergartner in Detroit Public Schools Community District. With the bitter cold set to continue, Harris was calling for school to be canceled. “He gets a ride, but I know a lot of parents out here in Detroit don't have the opportunity to drive their kids to school,\" Harris said. That’s why Detroit is one of more than 300 schools and school districts, closing Tuesday due to the weather. Hazel Park Schools is also closed. “There will be schools that will be open because it’s kind of on that verge between -10 and -15 degree wind chill,” Hazel Park Superintendent Amy Kruppe said. Kruppe says a lot of factors go into making the decision. She and other superintendents in metro Detroit consult with each other and meteorologists. Wind chill of -15 is usually the threshold she uses when deciding whether or not to cancel school, and while wind chill was the main reason for closing, ice also played a role. “Several of us closed early and made that decision based on the sidewalks are icy,\" Kruppe said. \"We're not going to be able to put salt on those sidewalks, and it's very dangerous for those kids.\" “We have a lot of children out here that walk because their parents don't have reliable transportation,” Harris said. As for Harris, he’s thankful Detroit schools are closed and hopes they’ll be closed again Wednesday, so he can spend time with his son indoors and out of the cold. “I would encourage you to stay home, grab a book, grab some hot chocolate and make some good memories with your family,” Kruppe said. As the cold continues, some schools may also announce closures for Wednesday. Related: School closings and delays",
