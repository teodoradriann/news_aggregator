    "text": "As of: February 23, 2024, 1:08 p.m\nBy: Christian Stör\nComments\nPress\nSplit\nDonald Trump talks himself into a rage in Nasvhille Tennessee.\n© IMAGO/George Walker IV / Tennessean.com\nIn a speech, Donald Trump describes the US election in religious terms.\nHe compares the election campaign to the battles of the Second World War.\nNashville – Donald Trump likes to indulge in apocalyptic images these days.\nThe reason is the fight for the presidency in the US election in November.\nFor Trump it is important to fight the “final battle”.\nShortly before the next US primaries in South Carolina on Saturday (February 24th), Trump upped the ante again.\nAt a National Evangelical Media Association forum in Nashville, Tennessee, the Republican favorite compared the election to D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge in World War II.\nThis year nothing less than God's intervention is needed to save the USA.\n“Today we find ourselves in another battle for the survival of our nation,” Trump said in his speech, according to the\nReuters\nnews agency .\n“This time the biggest threat doesn't come from outside, I really believe that: it comes from within.” He is here because he knows “that to win this fight, just like in the battles of the past, we still have to needing the mercy of the Almighty.”\nDonald Trump presents himself as a “proud Christian”\nIn his speech, Donald Trump presented himself as a “proud Christian” and used passionate words to rally support for the religious right.\n“I come before you as a friend, ally and brother in faith to ask for your help, your support and your prayers for this country,” he was quoted as saying by the\nAFP\nnews agency .\nWhen I return to the White House, I will once again aggressively defend religious freedom.\nDonald Trump speaks in Nashville, Tennessee\nTrump further emphasized that during his time in office he had fought harder for Christians than ever before.\n“When I return to the White House, I will once again aggressively defend religious freedom,” the former president promised.\n“Christians cannot afford to be on the sidelines in this fight,” the Republican continued.\n“The radical left is targeting all of us because they know we are not loyal to them.\nOur loyalty is to our country and our Creator.” He described incumbent Joe Biden as an “incompetent president” who would not lead the people “to the promised land.”\nMy news\nRussia escalates tensions on the border with Finland and sends thousands of refugees\nAfter the heaviest losses: Ukrainian elite command receives “combat boats” with 1,300 hp\nGermany sends another warship to the Red Sea – frigate “Hamburg” with special armament\nAfter Navalny's death: Biden comforts widow Julia - and lets Putin's oligarchs hunt down\nProtection from Putin: Skyranger instead of Cheetah - Bundeswehr gets new anti-aircraft tanks\nWarning of attacks: Putin's henchmen put famous Ukrainians on the death listread\nTrump's appearance in the Tennessee capital was no coincidence.\nThe state is among those where Republican primaries will take place on Super Tuesday on March 5th.\nIn all polls, Trump is well ahead of his rival Nikki Haley.\nTrump is courting the votes of the religious right before the US election\nThe religious right in the USA is now considered one of Trump's most loyal voter groups.\nAlthough this group only makes up 14.5 percent of the population, they represent 28 percent of the electorate.\nEvangelicals credit Trump with a number of political successes.\nEspecially since Trump's very conservative Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion that had existed since 1973, conservative Christians are clearly behind Trump.\nAt the end of his speech, Trump once again showed the audience what he hoped for on the day of the presidential election: \"With your help and God's grace, the great revival of America will begin on November 5, 2024.\"\n(cs/afp/rtr )",
