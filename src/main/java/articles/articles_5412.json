    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "For 30 years, Amy Aguon has taught English as a second language to elementary students, but it wasn’t until the COVID-19 pandemic that she discovered a gap in children’s literature that compelled her to pick up her pen.\n“I just don’t see the stories that I’m writing. I don’t see them out there,” Aguon told The Guam Daily Post. She has authored seven self-published children’s books rooted in CHamoru culture, legends and island superstitions. “I’ve been talking to some adults and they’ve never heard of that legend of Chaifi, and someone even asked me, are you making that up? And I said, no, it’s one of the Guam legends.”\nAguon’s books, available on Amazon for about three years, are part of what she describes as “a growing movement to bring more Pacific Islander stories to young readers around the world.” Her work fills a specific niche in children’s literature by transforming traditional CHamoru legends into accessible picture books for readers ages 5 to 9.\n“I see that although we have books about legends, they’re all compilations. And so what I’m putting out there are picture books of the legends,” Aguon said.\nThe Marcial Sablan Elementary School teacher has created two distinct series. Her first focuses on individual CHamoru legends, including the story of Chaifi, a creation figure in CHamoru mythology.\n“A lot of people don’t know… we have Guam CHamorus’ own story of creation. And so Chaifi is the one who created man according to the legend,” she said, noting that this particular story targets slightly older children, ages 9 to 12, due to its complex themes.\nHer newer series centers on Tressy, a young Guamanian girl who experiences different cultural superstitions and learns about legends alongside her brother, Tony. The character’s name holds special significance.\n“Tressy means 13 in CHamoru, and ‘Tressy’s my mom’s nickname. So, the character’s… named after my mom,” Aguon said.\nThree books in the Tressy series have been published so far: \"Tressy and the Taotaomo’na,\" \"Tressy’s Wet Hair\" and \"Tressy and the Utak.\" Each 32-page paperback book incorporates local superstitions that many island residents may not be familiar with.\n\"Tressy’s Wet Hair\" tells the story of a girl who loves to bathe but, one night, decides to shower after her mother tells her to wait until morning.\n“She didn’t listen. She waited until her mom fell asleep and she went into the shower and her hair was wet,” Aguon said. “She didn’t want to turn on the blow dryer because she would wake her mom and get scolded. So, she went to sleep with wet hair. And then when she woke up, she had a crooked mouth. And so… that’s the superstition. Don’t sleep with wet hair.”\nAnother book introduces readers to the Utak, a superstitious bird associated with pregnant women.\n“You would see it if there’s a pregnant woman,” Aguon said. “You know, I’ve never seen it. It’s kind of like the Taotaomo’na. You know, no one’s really seen it.”\nAguon not only writes her stories but also illustrates them. She initially experimented with artificial intelligence for her earlier works before transitioning to hand-drawn illustrations.\n“My earlier books, the very first ones, they were more, I was kind of experimenting with AI. So, some of the books are AI. But then I started (to) move towards doing the illustrations myself,” she said.\nThe books include practical educational elements, such as glossaries that explain CHamoru words used in the stories. For example, readers learn that “tata” is “a loving word for dad or grandfather,” and “pugua” means “betel nut,” complete with pronunciation guides.\nAccording to Aguon, the response from the community has been overwhelmingly positive.\n“So, I gave each teacher at my school a book. And they all were saying, ‘Oh, how the illustrations were so cute.’ And they’re asking me, ‘How did I get that name Tressy?’ And they just really liked it,” Aguon said.\nThe books serve a particularly important purpose for CHamoru families living off-island.\n“I’m writing these books for, especially, a lot of my family members who have children, grandchildren off island,” she said. “They’re asking me, ‘Oh gosh, can I have some books? I’d like to buy some of your books.’ They’d like the culture to continue on with their extended family who are in the States.”\nCurrently available exclusively through Amazon, Aguon is exploring local distribution options. She has reached out to Bestseller bookstores and recently announced her books will soon be available at Rexall Drugs in the locally featured artists section. She’s also considering pop-up events and direct sales to make her work more accessible to island families.\nBeyond her self-published works, Aguon has submitted manuscripts to the University of Guam Press, including a book about her mother’s experiences during World War II’s occupation of Guam, targeted toward middle school readers.\n“I’m kind of helping to fill this need for more stories about our island, our culture,” Aguon said. “I just want to teach… children and adults about some of our superstitions.”",
