    "title": "Every Day A Woman Leaves Food On the Porch For Her Grieving Sister Who Lost Her Military Husband & Won’t Leave The House",
    "text": "\"I know this isn’t going to make it any better, but I am here for you,\" she told her sister.\nBy\n[Mary-Faith Martinez](/users/mary-faith-martinez)\n Irina Shatilova | Shutterstock\nMembers of the military make sacrifices every day. Sometimes less visible but no less appreciated are the sacrifices made by their families. In these cases, it’s important to have a good support system around you.\nOne woman is doing what she can to be the best support system possible for her sister who is grieving the loss of her military husband.\nThe supportive woman left food on the porch every day for her sister, who recently lost her husband.\nThe touching footage from her sister's Ring doorbell camera has circulated TikTok. In the video, the woman walked up to the front door of the house and knocked on it. She then began talking to her sister, who was inside the house, using the doorbell's microphone to communicate.\n“I know you’re in there,” she said. “I can’t imagine what you’re going through right now.”\nRELATED:\nTerminally Ill Mom Asks For Advice From People Who Lost Their Moms Young — 'I Want Her To Know She'll Never Be Alone'\nThe video’s caption informed us of the sad truth: “She leaves food on the porch every day for her sister who lost\nher military husband.”\n“Eric was a great man,\" the woman said of her late brother-in-law. \"And I know we’re all proud of him … He’s a hero.”\nThe woman then offered what support she could from the other side of the door. “I know this isn’t going to make it any better, but I am here for you,” she said.\nThe woman clearly hoped that her patience and persistence would eventually pay off. “I know it’s going to be a while until I see your face again, and even longer until I see your smile again, but I’m going to stop by every day until you’re ready.”\nShe then gestured to the\nplate of food she’d been holding. “I made you your favorite. I know you’re … probably not ready to eat yet, but I’m going to leave it right here, okay?” She sat the plate down on a stool on the porch.\nBefore she left, she had one more thing to drop off. “At the last family gathering,” she said, “Eric, he left his favorite hat, so I thought I’d bring it back to you.” The woman held up a cap with the American flag emblazoned on the front.\nUnderstanding that her sister might not be ready to eat yet, the woman gave her an out. “If when I come back tomorrow, just the hat’s gone and not the food, that’s okay,” she stated. “Please know that I understand and\nI’m here for you no matter what.”\nRELATED:\nMan Offers A 'Friendly Reminder' After His Co-Worker Passed Away With Leftover PTO & Money In Her 401K She'd Been Saving For Years\nPeople were understandably touched by the video.\n“This is exactly what she needs!\nBest sister ever!” one person wrote.\n“This absolutely broke my heart into pieces,” another said.\nA third person chimed in, writing, “This hurt to watch. The sister is grieving too but she just wants her sis to be ok.”\nThere are many ways to help someone who is grieving.\nLending a hand to someone who is grieving is an admirable act. They're likely feeling many intense and painful emotions, and it can be difficult to know the best way to help. Harvard Health listed multiple ways one can aid a grieving loved one, stating that it’s important to “be specific when offering help.” Simply asking if there’s anything you can do puts more of a burden on the person you’re trying to support. U.S. News and World Report stated that approximately 1,400 members of the military pass away each year. Each of those service members represents a family who made the ultimate sacrifice. If each family had someone like this sister to support them, the world would truly be a better place.\nRELATED:\nVideographer Refuses To Give Refund After Bride-To-Be Dies In A Car Crash — ‘We Hope You Cry All Day On What Would Have Been Your Wedding’\nMary-Faith Martinez is a writer for YourTango who covers entertainment, news and human interest topics.",

    "title": "LG autonomy: Bauchi residents hail Supreme Court judgement",
    "text": "Some respondents in Bauchi have described the Thursday Supreme Court judgement on LGAs’ financial autonomy as the best thing to have happened to democratic governance.\nA cross-section of those who spoke to Tribune Online expressed confidence that LGAs, as the third tier of government as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), will now find their positions to govern.\nAbdullahi Yalwa, National Publicity Secretary of ASUP, while reacting, said, “As a proud Nigerian, let me begin by thanking the Lord Almighty for this blessing from the Supreme Court. I equally salute the apex court for its commitment towards national interest, progress, and development, as this is the summary content of the judgement to me.”\nHe added, “The beginning of a new prosperous Nigeria is indeed contained in the outcome of today’s judgement. The FGN has done well in its approach to the emancipation of Nigerians through the court from the self-centred politicians at the state level.”\nAccording to him, “Nigerians and indeed the FGN must be courageous to ensure the honest implementation of the judgement, as the governors, who are the major part of the country’s problem, will do all it takes to manipulate the successful execution of the judgement.”\nHe added, “The remaining issue left is for the country to review the electoral act and ensure that INEC, instead of the so-called SIEC, conducts the elections for the 774 LGAs in Nigeria and that the tenure of such elected chairmen starts and ends with the President, Governors, and other elected officers.”\nAbdullahi Yalwa further said, “People of substance should present themselves for service to humanity across all parties at this level of government as the most vital tier of administration in my understanding. When that is achieved, Nigeria will see rapid positive transformation in the form of improved security and safety, critical infrastructure development, and enhanced quality of life for the vast majority of Nigerians, who are believed to be rural dwellers at the LGA level.”\nHe stressed, “I am happy with the judgement, and it has renewed my hope in the Nigerian judiciary.”\nAlso reacting to the Supreme Court’s decision on L.G. autonomy, Bauchi-based legal practitioner Barrister Jibrin O. Jibrin said, “It is a very welcome development. As a citizen of Nigeria, an attorney and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, and a proponent of responsible democratic governance in the country, I welcome the judgement this morning by the Supreme Court upholding and granting financial autonomy to the local governments.”\nHe stressed, “The judgement represents a watershed in the struggle to entrench and deepen democratic governance at the local government level.”\n“To my mind, the Supreme Court has lived up to the task of interpreting as well as determining the correct position of the law on the issue,” he added.\nThe former Bauchi NBA Chairman stressed, “We are now looking forward to immediate compliance and enforcement of the verdict by all concerned and are hopeful that with full financial autonomy granted to them through this judgement, local governments will rise to their responsibility by ensuring that there is efficient, effective, and result-oriented administration at the third tier of government in such a manner that the people will in no time feel the positive impact of this landmark development.”\nHe concluded by saying, “I shall once more commend the Supreme Court for this wise and justice-serving decision while calling on fellow Nigerians to brace up for the task ahead. It is indeed a great one, and may we keep getting it right as a country.”\nIn his own reaction, a one-time Executive Chairman of Tafawa Balewa LGA and former member of the State House of Assembly, Muhammad Aminu Tukur, said, “Glory be to God. The Supreme Court of Nigeria has salvaged the souls of the common citizens of this great nation.”\nAccording to him, “granting local governments autonomy is a great feat, as the councils have finally gotten their most needed and essential freedom from the hands of fascist governors presiding over the affairs of their respective states along with the LGAs under their respective territories.”\nAminu Tukur stressed, “Prior to this laudable and commendable judgement, virtually all the LGAs across the length and breadth of Nigeria were reduced to mere salary pay points, denied the right to carry out their responsibilities as the third tier of government, nor given the chance even to provide the simplest social services such as constructing a mere culvert or pit latrine.”\nHe added, “The judgement in itself is commendable, as the primary reason for the creation of the local governments was to bring government closer to the people. With this development, the common citizens will surely access the dividends of leadership at close range.”\n“Finally, let me use this medium to commend the government of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for championing this cause to a final conclusion. I presided over an LGA with absolute autonomy under the military regime of General Abacha; this I envy and cherish to be retained,” the politician concluded.\nALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\nReps query Women Minister spending practices FULL LIST: 12 more state-owned tertiary institutions submit data to NELFUND BREAKING: Tinubu swears in eight new permanent secretaries UPDATED: Oyo APC lawmaker, Akinremi, is dead Reps to scrutinize controversial clauses in Samoa partnership agreement FULL LIST: NGX suspends eight companies from trading in shares",

    "title": "NASA Reveals Images of Large Asteroids That Just Sailed Past Earth",
    "text": "Last week, Earth was treated to a rare event: not one, but two large asteroids,\npassing by within hailing distance.\nNeither 2024 MK nor 2011 UL21, as the asteroids are named, came close enough to pose a hazard, but both were within range of radar imaging systems. So NASA got a few happy snaps to mark the occasion.\nThese are more than just\nasteroid flyby souvenirs. Scientists can study the images to understand the properties of the rocks that can be found in Earth's vicinity – information that can help us put together strategies for any future asteroids that might one day threaten our planet.\nEarth's little corner of the Solar System is mostly empty, but not completely. The occasional comet or asteroid sails by as it makes its own looping orbit around the Sun.\nThe vast majority of these are not going to be a problem. But anything that passes within a certain distance of Earth, or\nis above a certain brightness, is classified as potentially hazardous.\nThat's because, even though their current path might be fine, something unexpected could happen, such as a collision with another object that knocks it\nonto a collision course with Earth. It's not probable, but also not impossible.\nBoth 2024 MK and 2011 UL21 were in the potentially hazardous category; luckily for us, no unforeseen wackiness knocked them off course in our direction.\n2011 UL21 flew past Earth on June 27, at a distance of 6.6 million kilometers (4.1 million miles), about 17 times the distance between Earth and\nthe Moon.\nThen, less than two days later, 2024 MK made an appearance. On June 29, it flew past at a minimum distance of 295,000 kilometers (184,000 miles). That's much closer, about three quarters of the distance between Earth and Moon.\nImaging such objects isn't exactly easy, even when they're relatively close and classified as \"large\" asteroids. They're still pretty small in the scheme of things, and not very bright.\nThat's why NASA uses a\nlarge radar telescope to transmit radio waves into space, and receive the return signal from which scientists can construct images.\nBecause 2024 MK was a lot closer – such proximity for an asteroid flyby only occurs every few decades or so – we were able to get much more detailed images.\nNASA used one telescope to transmit the radio waves, and a second one to receive them, resulting in images of 2024 MK that include not just the shape of the asteroid, but bumps, divots, boulders, and ridges.\nIt measures roughly 150 meters (500 feet) across, and has an elongated shape with lots of flat planes. It tumbles as it moves through space, too.\nIt was only discovered on June 16, and its orbital path was altered by Earth's gravity, so the observations allow scientists to figure out what 2024 MK is going to do in the future. They revealed that for the foreseeable future, it's going to safely stay out of our way. Phew.\n\"This was an extraordinary opportunity to investigate the physical properties and obtain detailed images of a near-Earth asteroid,\"\nsays astronomer Lance Benner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n2011 UL21, at its much greater distance, didn't return images that were as detailed… but those images did include a little surprise. There, accompanying the 1.5-kilometer-wide asteroid, astronomers spotted a tiny moonlet, at an orbital distance of around 3 kilometers.\nThis is something we're finding\nmore and more with large asteroids, actually.\nLast year,\nasteroid Dinkinesh, an object in the asteroid belt visited by the NASA Lucy probe, was discovered to have a little moon. And NASA's famous Double Asteroid Redirection Test, in which a spacecraft was smashed into an asteroid, was performed on Dimorphos, the smaller of a binary asteroid pair.\nWe're finding more binary asteroids because our imaging capabilities are improving, and this is excellent news for planetary defense, and our understanding of Solar System evolution.\n\"It is thought that about two-thirds of asteroids of this size are binary systems,\"\nBenner says, \"and their discovery is particularly important because we can use measurements of their relative positions to estimate their mutual orbits, masses, and densities, which provide key information about how they may have formed.\"\nAnd they're just so gosh-danged cute. Hey there, lil buddy. Fly by any time.",

    "title": "Iraq Debates Legalizing Marriage for 9-Year-Old Girls | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "By Newsmax Staff | Thursday, 08 August 2024 04:37 PM EDT Iraqi Parliament's proposed amendments to the Personal Status Law, which could legalize child marriages and strip women of key rights, have sparked widespread outrage and protests across the nation. Protests are planned in at least seven provinces throughout Iraq on Thursday in response to proposed amendments to the Personal Status Law that could legalize child marriages, strip widows of their inheritance, and enable sex slavery. The Iraqi Parliament began debating these amendments on Sunday, raising significant concerns among human rights activists and citizens alike, Breitbart reported. The amendments would allow men to opt for traditional Shiite or Sunni Islamic mandates over the country's existing legal standards for matters like marriage consent, alimony, and child custody. Currently, Iraqi law mandates that both men and women must be at least 18-years-old to marry and provides protections for widows and inter-religious marriages. The proposed changes could drastically alter these protections, potentially legalizing child marriages and giving fathers full custody rights in divorce cases unless they choose otherwise. Notably, the amendments would require Shiites to follow the Ja'afari school of Islamic law, which permits girls to marry at the age of nine and boys at the age of 15. This legal code also includes provisions for \"pleasure marriages,\" temporary arrangements that can last as little as an hour, which critics argue could be used to justify prostitution and sex slavery. Lawmakers are reportedly under intense pressure from radical Shiite Islamist clerics and other influential figures to pass the law. Following the fall of Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein and the subsequent rise of Shiite influence backed by Iran, Shiite leaders have gained significant power, particularly through the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a group of militias integrated into Iraq's armed forces during the fight against ISIS. An anonymous parliamentary source revealed to the Media Line that Shiite powers are leveraging their influence to ensure the law's passage, stating, \"They are now negotiating with us — either we pass the law or no other law proposed by the rest of the blocs will be passed, and since they are the majority, they may pass this law, but they need more votes.\" The proposed amendments have faced strong opposition from human rights activists and a coalition of over 15 female lawmakers determined to block the changes. \"Our rejection is not based on emotional issues, as some might claim, nor is it driven by external motives, but rather based on legal, religious, professional, and social observations, and stems from a sincere concern to protect the Iraqi family,\" the lawmakers said in a statement translated by the Emirati newspaper The National. Shiite clerics like Sheikh Mohammed Khalil Al-Sanjari and Sayed Jafar al-Mousawi maintain that Islamic law considers girls mature at nine and boys at 15, thus permitting marriage at those ages. Human Rights Watch highlighted the prevalence of child marriages in Iraq, noting that despite the current law, the government does little to enforce it. \"According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), 28 percent of girls in Iraq are married before age 18,\" and the U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq reports that \"22 percent of unregistered marriages involve girls under age 14.\" © 2024 Newsmax. All rights reserved.

    "title": "El déficit de camareros y cocineros complica la recta final del año en Castellón",
    "text": "Ofertas de trabajo vigentes\nEl déficit de camareros y cocineros complica la recta final del año en Castellón\nLas ETT no encuentran candidatos profesionales y los restaurantes adolecen de personal de baja o aspirantes que prefieren «no trabajar durante las fiestas»\n«No hay candidatos profesionales para las ofertas de trabajo en el sector de la hostelería, ni en Castellón ni en otras provincias». Así de tajantes se muestran Empresas de Trabajo Temporal (ETT), sobre la dificultad para encontrar personal para cubrir los picos de trabajo en los resaturantes, en una época prolífica como es la recta final del año, con comidas y cenas de empresa, y multitud de encuentros familiares y de amigos en fechas navideñas.\nLa delegada de la ETT Adecco en Castellón, Pilar Trilles, explicó que aunque cuentan con una bolsa de personas a las que llamar durante todo el año para trabajar en hostelería y atender eventos, se queda corta, y suele tratarse de estudiantes o parados de larga duración, sin formación. «Y este déficit se acusa también en otras provincias, con lo que hay pocas alternativas. Y el personal de cocina o sala que sale preparado -de la Escuela de Hostelería del Grao o del CdT- pues suele terminar los estudios con un trabajo debajo del brazo, por los contactos de los formadores, que son empresarios del sector también», relata.\nPandemia: de la bandeja a los hornos\nEl déficit se agravó ya en la pandemia, cuando al cerrar temporalmente muchos locales de hostelería los empleados más preparados buscaron alternativas en la industria, y ahora se han quedado en fábricas y prefieren esos turnos de 8 horas e irse a casa, apuntan fuentes del sector de reclutamiento de recursos humanos.\nEn el caso de Adecco, Trilles explica que recurriendo al ingenio en ocasiones «fabricamos camareros», es decir, los forman «en la división especializada en hostelería de Adecco en Valencia», de cara a disponer de mano de obra con una mínima formación para atender eventos todo el año.\n«Es un problema endémico»\nEl vicepresidente ejecutivo de la patronal turística y hostelera Ashotur, Luis Martí, explicó que «es ya de un problema endémico. Sobre todo, está costando encontrar a cocineros y camareros, fundamentalmente. Pero, al final, creo que podremos disponer».\nEl punto de vista de los empresarios corrobora la problemática. Silvia Franch (Grupo Brisamar) reflexiona: «Al final siempre encuentras, pero hay poca seriedad. Hay gente que dice que viene y luego te falla, recurres a ETT y aún así igual no se presentan. Muchos no quieren trabajar festivos».\nBajas de salud mental\nEn la línea, Víctor Maicas (de Rústico MM) coincide en que «es complicadísimo, la verdad, encontrar personal con ganas de trabajar. Quien sí trabaja vemos que se coge baja psicológica a la mínima discusión con el encargado o con alguien. Te puedes encontrar con varias personas de baja por salud mental. Y si buscas no encuentras a nadie preparado. A los buenos, de la vieja escuela, se los rifan». En l’Escudella de Vilafranca relatan que cuesta hallar personal de sala: «Si no encontramos, como nos pasó en verano, reduciremos a la mitad de capacidad del restaurante para dar servicio, perdiendo ingresos extra. De momento los únicos dos candidatos que han respondido a las ofertas nos han avisado que no trabajarían del 24 de diciembre al 6 de enero, ni en Sant Antoni».\nOfertas de contrato fijo de lunes a sábado\nCamareros, cocineros, auxiliares de cocina y jefes de economato son los perfiles más buscados en estas fechas en Castelló, Peñíscola o Alcossebre. Y en hoteles, gobernantas y camareras de piso. Un restaurante de Morella ofrece contrato indefinido, de lunes a sábado, de 9.00 a 17.00 horas.\nReorganizar turnos y cerrar algunos días\nLos restauradores de Castellón, tanto en la costa como ciudad o el interior, capean como pueden la falta crónica de personal formado y disponible y optan incluso por cerrar un día o más a la semana. En Cal Dimoni (Vila-real) señalan: «solo trabajamos hasta mediodía, y cerramos lunes y martes».\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=El%20d%C3%A9ficit%20de%20camareros%20y%20cocineros%20complica%20la%20recta%20final%20del%20a%C3%B1o%20en%20Castell%C3%B3n%20https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/12/01/deficit-camareros-cocineros-complica-recta-112149003.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/12/01/deficit-camareros-cocineros-complica-recta-112149003.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/12/01/deficit-camareros-cocineros-complica-recta-112149003.html&text=El%20d%C3%A9ficit%20de%20camareros%20y%20cocineros%20complica%20la%20recta%20final%20del%20a%C3%B1o%20en%20Castell%C3%B3n%20%20https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/12/01/deficit-camareros-cocineros-complica-recta-112149003.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40epmediterraneo)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=El%20d%C3%A9ficit%20de%20camareros%20y%20cocineros%20complica%20la%20recta%20final%20del%20a%C3%B1o%20en%20Castell%C3%B3n%20&body=https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/12/01/deficit-camareros-cocineros-complica-recta-112149003.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil\n[El dueño de Mercadona vende las acciones de la firma de la Vall d'Uixó tugesto](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/26/dueno-mercadona-vende-acciones-firma-112075222.html)[Una nueva vida en Benicàssim después de perder sus casas por la DANA](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/28/nueva-vida-benicassim-despues-perder-112115988.html)[Esto es lo que cobrarán en 2025 los 3.312 pensionistas de Castellón que perciben la paga máxima](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/26/cobraran-2025-3-312-pensionistas-112041369.html)[Tres empresas pugnan por desarrollar el proyecto del eje de la cerámica de Castellón](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/30/castellon-tres-empresas-pugnan-desarrollar-proyecto-eje-ceramica-112188689.html)[Un ciudadano de Rumanía se nacionaliza español cada 2 días en Castellón](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/23/ciudadano-rumania-nacionaliza-espanol-2-111954439.html)[Los autobuses de Castellón vuelven a la huelga este jueves y viernes: estos son los servicios mínimos](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/27/autobuses-castellon-vuelven-huelga-jueves-112097891.html)[Más de 13.200 nóminas en Castellón tendrán un recargo ‘extra’ para pagar las pensiones](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/30/castellon-13-200-nominas-tendran-recargo-extra-pensiones-112189152.html)[Un incendio en un hotel de Orpesa obliga a desalojar el edificio](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/30/incendio-hotel-orpesa-obliga-desalojar-112217548.html)",

    "text": "Las repercusiones por el insólito desenlace del partido Argentina-Marruecos no cesan a pesar del paso de las horas. Por un lado, la FIFA anunció la apertura de una investigación, a la vez que el Comité Olímpico Argentino se plegó al pedido de la AFA de encontrar responsables por los incidentes que sucedieron. Por el contrario, la Ministra de Deportes francesa minimizó los hechos.\nLa Comisión Disciplinaria de la FIFA decidió nombrar a un experto en integridad para que preste su ayuda en las investigaciones sobre posibles contravenciones de la reglamentación del organismo tras los incidentes acaecidos durante el partido entre Argentina y Marruecos, de la primera jornada del torneo masculino de los Juegos de París 2024.\nLa FIFA añadió que aplicará el artículo 36 de su Código y que publicará más información sobre el resultado de dichas investigaciones \"a su debido tiempo\". La reacción llegó a partir del reclamo de la AFA, que a través de su presidente, Claudio Tapia, exigió una investigación \"para que se tomen las medidas reglamentarias pertinentes y se imponga una sanción a quien o quienes corresponda\".\nEn ese sentido se manifestó el COA. \"Ante los lamentables hechos ocurridos durante y después del partido de fútbol entre Argentina y Marruecos, el Comité Olímpico Argentino se solidariza con nuestros atletas y adhiere a la presentación que la Asociación del Fútbol Argentino hiciera ante la FIFA\", expresó la entidad en su cuenta de X.\nSin embargo, desde Francia la reacción fue bastante diferente. La ministra de deportes de Francia, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, minimizó los hechos y hasta los justificó por \"un largo tiempo de descuento\". \"Hubo una pequeña intrusión que no debería haber ocurrido, pero que fue bastante bondadosa por parte de los seguidores marroquíes. Luego se entrelazó con un largo tiempo de descuento en el que hubo un poco de dilación en cuanto al arbitraje. Fue un pequeño momento de confusión, no quiero negarlo\", remarcó Oudéa-Castéra.\nEn cambio, fuentes de la organización informaron a la agencia EFE de que París 2024 se toma \"muy en serio\" los incidentes que enturbiaron el final del partido. \"Podemos confirmar que las medidas de seguridad reforzadas, incluida una mayor presencia de agentes al pie del terreno, serán adoptadas en los próximos partidos en el estadio de Saint-Etienne\", señalaron.\nSegún la información de París 2024, \"un pequeño grupo de aficionados se introdujo en el terreno de juego en el minuto 105 del Argentina-Marruecos, al pensar, sin razón, que el partido había terminado\". Una hora y media más tarde, el partido se reanudó \"con total seguridad\" y \"sin que ninguna persona resultara herida\", indicaron las fuentes.",
