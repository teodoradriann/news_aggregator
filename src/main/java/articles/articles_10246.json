    "title": "Internet piles on GOP lawmaker who proclaimed Trump a 'harbinger of Black excellence'",
    "text": "Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) took to Fox Business ahead of the\nCNN debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, to proclaim that the former president is a great force for good in the Black community.\n\"President Trump is a harbinger of Black excellence,\" Hunt, who is Black, told host Larry Kudlow. He went on to tout his recent gathering with voters at a barbershop in Atlanta alongside his fellow guest, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), where Trump's mugshot from the Fulton County criminal case was on display; some of Trump's allies have bizarrely claimed that criminal charges could make Trump\nmore relatable to Black people.\nCommenters on social media were indignant at Hunt's claim.\nALSO READ:\nRep. Byron Donalds, his gigantic Jim Crow myth and a forgotten fact about Black voters\n\"The Central Park 5 beg to differ,\"\nwrote the account @sirDukeDevin, referring to an infamous episode from Trump's past in which he demonized in racially charged terms a Black group of joggers accused of a brutal rape but later found to be innocent.\n\"That he said this with a straight face is incredible,\"\nhttps://x.com/Gregnus__2024/status/1806429675335335996 the account @Gregnus__2024.\n\"The levels of cringe and secondhand embarrassment in this clip... Jesus Christ,\"\nhttps://x.com/JayNCtoDC/status/1806428541308764322 the account @JayNCtoDC.\n\"Trump is not invited to the cookout and neither are any of these men on the stage,\"\nhttps://x.com/TruWordsRSpoken/status/1806430564398092489 the account @TruWordsRSpoken.\nThe former president has sought to bolster his numbers with Black voters going into the 2024 election season. Among other things, he has touted the economic gains made by Black voters during his administration, even though Black unemployment is\neven lower now than it was while he was in office.\nHunt's associate Donalds, who hosted another Black voter outreach session in Philadelphia, came under controversy while there for seeming to suggest that Black families were\nstronger under Jim Crow, a sentiment he swiftly tried to disavow.",

    "text": "GARY, Ind. (WISH) — A police officer in Gary fatally shot a man during an armed hostage situation, according to the Lake County Sheriff’s Department in a Wednesday news release. At 9 p.m. Tuesday, Lake County deputies responded to an apartment in the 2200 block of Carolina Street to assist Gary Police Department officers with securing a perimeter around the building. An armed man inside the apartment had reportedly held at least two people hostage: A 35-year-old male relative and a 1-year-old boy. Shots were fired inside the apartment and the relative suffered a minor injury. The relative was able to run from the apartment and refused medical treatment at the scene. The suspect refused to leave the apartment and fired multiple rounds at police during the incident. The Gary Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team requested the use of a Lake County Sheriff’s Department specialized tactical armored vehicle in an attempt to safely position officers closer to the scene. The department deployed the armored unit with four SWAT officers. The Lake County Sheriff’s Department Drone team provided real-time aerial surveillance. A ramming tool on the armored unit was used to breach the back door to the apartment, removing it. SWAT officers deployed tear gas inside the apartment, but the suspect refused to come out. He was seen approaching the front door several times with a gun in one hand and the boy in the other. Sometime around 4:20 a.m. Wednesday, the suspect walked out of the back door toward his vehicle holding the boy and pointing a gun at police. At that time, a Gary officer opened fire and the suspect was wounded. The suspect was later pronounced dead. The boy was not harmed. Investigators identified the suspect as a 38-year-old man, but they did not immediately provide his name. Lake County Crime Scene Investigation collected evidence at the scene. The investigation of this incident is ongoing.",

It is believed that thrombosis, a form of a blood clot, is an isolated condition for the 21-year-old All-Star. The clot was discovered following his return to San Antonio from the NBA All-Star Game in San Francisco last week.\nAs reported by [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/43937353/spurs-shut-victor-wembanyama-blood-clot-shoulder), sources close to the Spurs have indicated that Wembanyama is expected to make a full recovery before the 25-26 season.\nWemby's absence for the rest of the season is a devastating loss for the Spurs, especially following his historic first season in the league. The absence also means he's not eligible for awards such as Defensive Player of the Year—an award he was a favorite for before the announcement—which has a 65-game minimum.\nWembanyama has yet to comment on the news.\nSHOP NEW ARRIVALS\n[Shop Now](https://www.complex.com/shop/collections/new-arrivals)\nHellstar\nHellstar Sports Flame Zip-Up\nOhana Hatake\nOhana Full-Bloom Tigerlily\nSelena Gomez\nI Said I Love You First - COMPLEX Exclusive Clearwater Vinyl\nOM New York\nCreme Rose",

    "text": "“People living near the borders are no less than soldiers,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday stating that if a soldier protects the country by wearing a uniform, the residents of border areas are serving the motherland in their own way. He said this after inaugurating 35 projects comprising 29 bridges and six roads constructed by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) across seven States and Union Territories at a cost of ₹670 crore.\nEleven of them are in Jammu and Kashmir, nine in Ladakh, eight in Arunachal Pradesh, three in Uttarakhand, two in Sikkim and one each in Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh, the Defence Ministry said in a statement. “These projects have been constructed under challenging weather conditions at the most inhospitable terrain,” it stated.\nThe event was organised on Dhak Bridge, a state-of-the-art 93-metre long Class 70R bridge over Dhak Nallah, which was inaugurated by Mr. Singh on the site. The remaining 34 projects, which were virtually inaugurated by Mr. Singh, include Ragini-Ustad-Pharkian Gali Road in Jammu and Kashmir. “It is a 38.25-km long CL-9 road, which will provide all-weather connectivity between Tangdhar and Keren sector, bolstering the operational readiness of the military,” the statement said.\n“There was a time when border infrastructure development was not given much importance. Governments used to work with the mentality that the people living in the plains are the mainstream people. They were worried that the developments on the border might be used by the adversary. Due to this narrow mentality, development never reached the border areas,” Mr. Singh said. “This thinking has changed today. Under the leadership of PM Modi, our government is committed to the development of border areas, keeping in view the Nation’s security needs. We do not consider these areas as buffer zones. They are a part of our mainstream.”\nClimate change Drawing attention to the increasing number of natural disasters in some border States and Union Territories including Uttarakhand, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim in recent years, Mr. Singh said that many experts believe that climate change is the reason behind these incidents. He called climate change as not just a weather-related phenomenon, but a very serious issue related to national security. The Minister added that the Defence Ministry is taking this very seriously and will seek cooperation from friendly countries in this regard.\nMr. Singh said they have ensured risk and hardship allowance for permanent civilian personnel of BRO at par with the armed forces. Ex-gratia compensation of casual laborers has been increased to ₹5 lakh from ₹2 lakh. Recently, approval was granted for the provision of insurance of ₹10 lakh for our casual paid labourers (CPLs), he noted.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "title": "Cyclone Alfred is slowing down - and that could make it more destructive. Here's how climate change might have influenced it",
    "text": "Cyclone Alfred has now been delayed, as the slow-moving system stalls in warm seas off southeast Queensland. Unfortunately, the expected slow pace of the cyclone will bring even more rain to affected communities.\nThis is because it will linger for longer over the same location, dumping more rain before it moves on. Alfred’s slowing means the huge waves triggered by the cyclone will last longer too, likely making coastal erosion and flooding worse.\nCyclone Alfred is unusual – the first cyclone in half a century to come this far south and make expected landfall.\nWhen unusual disasters strike, people naturally want to know what role climate change played – a process known as “climate attribution”. Unfortunately, this process takes time if you want details on a specific event.\nWe can’t yet say if Alfred’s unusual path and slow speed are linked to climate change. But climate change is driving very clear trends which can load the dice for more intense cyclones arriving in subtropical regions. These include the warm waters which fuel cyclones spreading further south, and cyclones dumping more rain than they used to.\nSo, let’s unpick what’s driving Cyclone Alfred’s behaviour – including the potential role of climate change.\nA Bureau of Meteorology update on Cyclone Alfred dated Thursday, March 6. Not necessarily climate linked: Alfred’s southerly path Many cyclones make it as far south as Brisbane – but they’re nearly all far out at sea. Weather patterns mean most cyclones heading south are diverted to the east, where remnants can hit New Zealand as large extratropical storms.\nThe fact that Alfred is set to make landfall is very unusual. But we can’t yet definitively say this is due to climate change. Cyclones are steered by winds and weather patterns, and the Coral Sea’s complex weather makes cyclone paths here very hard to predict.\nAlfred’s abrupt westward shift is due to a large region of high pressure to its south, which has pushed it directly towards heavily populated areas of southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales. These steering winds are not very strong, which is why Alfred is moving slowly.\nIn 2014, researchers showed cyclones are reaching their maximum intensity in areas further south in the southern hemisphere and north in the northern hemisphere than they used to. In 2021, researchers also found cyclones were reaching their maximum intensity closer to coasts, moving about 30 km closer per decade.\nClimate link: Warmer seas Cyclones typically need water temperatures of 26.5°C or more to form .\nMore than 90% of all extra heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions is stored in the seas . The oceans are the hottest on record , and records keep falling. But normal seasonal variability and shifting ocean currents are still at work too, and we can get unusually warm waters without climate change as a cause.\nWhat we do know is that ocean temperatures around much of Australia have been unusually warm.\nThe northeastern Coral Sea, where Cyclone Alfred formed, experienced the fourth-hottest temperatures on record for February and the hottest on record for January.\nIn the Coral Sea, sea surface temperatures were the fourth highest on record in February 2025 and the highest on record in January 2025. This figure shows the trend over time for February. , We also know Australia’s southern waters are warming up too.\nThe energy available to power tropical cyclones in subtropical regions has also increased in recent decades, due largely to rising ocean temperatures.\nAverage sea surface temperatures in central and southern Queensland on Thursday March 6th. Point Danger is on the Gold Coast. , Climate link: Fewer cyclones but more likely to be intense In the northern hemisphere, researchers have found a trend towards fewer cyclones over time. But of those which do form, a higher proportion are more intense.\nIt’s not fully clear if the same trend exists in the southern hemisphere, though we are seeing fewer cyclones forming over time.\nThis summer, eight tropical cyclones have formed in Australian waters. Six were classified as severe (category 3 and up). Historically, Australia has experienced a higher proportion of category 1 and 2 cyclones, which bring weaker wind speeds.\nOn average, we see about 11 cyclones form and 4-5 make landfall. There has been a downward trend in the number of cyclones forming in the Australian region in recent decades.\nFewer cyclones, but more likely to be intense: this figure shows the number of severe (Category 3 and up) and non-severe tropical cyclones (Category 1 and 2) since 1970/71. , Climate link: Cyclones dumping more rain The intensity of a cyclone refers to the speed of the wind and size of the wind-affected area.\nBut a cyclone’s rain field is also important. This refers to the area of heavy rain produced by storms when they’re at cyclone intensity and afterwards as they decay into tropical lows.\nThe rate of rainfall brought by cyclones in Australia isn’t necessarily increasing, but more cyclones are moving slowly , such as Alfred. This means more rain per cyclone, on average.\nRising ocean temperatures mean more water evaporates off the sea surface, meaning forming cyclones can absorb more moisture and dump more rain when it reaches land.\nWhy are cyclones slowing down? This is likely because air current circulation in the tropics has weakened. This has a clear link to climate change. Wind speeds have fallen 5 to 15% in the tropics, depending on where you are in the world. It’s hard to pinpoint the change clearly in our region, because the historic record of cyclone tracks isn’t very long.\nFor every degree (°C) of warming, rainfall intensity increases 7%. This is well established . But newer research is showing the rate may actually be double this or even higher , as the process of condensation releases heat which can trigger more rain.\nClear climate link: Bigger storm surges due to sea level rise Sea levels are on average about 20 centimetres higher than they were before 1880.\nWhen a cyclone is about to make landfall, its intense winds push up a body of seawater ahead of it – the storm surge. In low lying areas, this can spill out and flood streets.\nBecause climate change is causing baseline sea levels to rise, storm surges can reach further inland. Sea-level rise will also make coastal erosion more destructive.\nHuge swells have forced beach closures ahead of Cyclone Alfred’s arrival. Jason O'Brien/AAP What should we take from this? We can’t say definitively that climate change is behind Cyclone Alfred’s unusual track.\nBut factors such as rising sea levels, slower cyclones and warmer oceans are changing how cyclones behave and the damage they can do.\nOver time, we can expect to see cyclones arriving in regions not historically affected – and carrying more rain when they arrive.",
