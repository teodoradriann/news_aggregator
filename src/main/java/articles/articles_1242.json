Ces difficultés augmenteront de façon significative pour atteindre leur maximum vers la fin de matinée. Dès lors, elles devraient diminuer progressivement et se terminer en début d’après-midi.\" Samedi, il est conseillé de quitter ou de traverser l'Ile-de-France avant 6h ou après 13h dans le sens des départs. Dans le sens des retours, la circulation sera également très difficile dans le bassin parisien. \"En Île-de-France, les débits attendus aux différentes barrières de péages seront relativement importants. Toutefois les difficultés de circulation générées par ces retours devraient être accentuées par les déplacements liés aux JO\", indique Bison Futé. Il est préconisé de rejoindre ou de traverser la région avant 14h. Dimanche, des conditions encore difficiles Dimanche 4 août, la situation ne devrait pas s'améliorer en Ile-de-France. La circulation sera \"très difficile\" dans le sens des départs et des retours. \"Les trafics attendus aux différentes barrières de péages des autoroutes A10 et A6 seront relativement importants\", précise le service du ministère des Transports. Dans le sens des départs, il est conseillé de quitter la région avant 8h. Dans le sens des retours, Bison Futé recommande de rejoindre ou de traverser le bassin parisien avant 14h. Lundi, le trafic sera encore dense. Bison Futé classe l'Ile-de-France en jaune dans le sens des départs et des retours.",

    "text": "Premier League: Liverpool 3 (Gakpo 45, Jones 49, Salah 82) Leicester City 1 (Ayew 6) Liverpool have kicked off at 8pm on a St Stephen’s Day twice in their history. The first time was in 2019, when Jürgen Klopp’s team demolished Leicester en route to winning the Premier League title with ease. The second time ended with another convincing defeat of the Foxes. That may not be the only repeat.\nArne Slot’s soaring leaders moved seven points clear of their closest challengers for the title, with a game in hand, courtesy of a controlled comeback against Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side. Leicester took a shock early lead through Jordan Ayew and, while Liverpool never hit the heights of their 2019 performance at the King Power Stadium, goals from Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah’s 19th of the season ensured the outcome remained the same.\nAnfield was shrouded in fog for the night-time kickoff but, for Liverpool, there was an opportunity to put daylight between themselves and Chelsea following a perfect set of results elsewhere.\nThe league leaders’ prospects appeared healthy against a Leicester team that had been soundly beaten in their previous two fixtures and had a Premier League debutant in goal. Jakub Stolarczyk replaced Danny Ward as a result of the merciless barracking the Wales goalkeeper received from his own supporters in Leicester’s 3-0 defeat by Wolves on Sunday.\nREAD MORE Mikel Arteta hoping Gabriel Martinelli can help fill void following Saka’s injury",

    "text": "From fighting alongside Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose against the Britishers to making the first ever film in Bhojpuri cinema, Nazir Hussain has had one of the most interesting and charismatic lives in the history of Indian cinema.\nBorn on May 15, 1922, in Lucknow in a railway guard's family, Nazir Hussain worked as a fireman in the Indian Railways for a few months before joining the British army in the World War II. He became a prisoner of war in Malaysia and Singapore, where he was posted. After getting freed, he joined Subhash Chandra Bose's Indian National Army in his mission to wipe out the Britishers from India.\nWhen Japan fell to the British, Hussain was transported back to India and found himself jobless. Soon, he started performing plays in Calcutta (now Kolkata), where he met the legendary Indian filmmaker Bimal Roy. Roy wanted to make a film based on the life of an INA soldier so he found Hussain in his search. Impressed by hi personaity, the director even asked him to act in the film and thus, Hussain made his debut in the 1950 film Pehla Aadmi, for which he wrote the story and dialogues also.\nPehla Aadmi was a wide success, and Hussain collaborated with Roy in his other successful films such as Parineeti, Do Bigha Zameen, and Devdas. The actor impressed the audience and the critics with his brilliant performances and became one of the most famous character actors in Hindi cinema of the 60s and 70s. Hussain worked in over hudnred films with superstars Guru Dutt, Dev Anand, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Rajesh Khanna, Parveen Babi, Asha Parekh, Hema Malini, and others.\nApart from his invaluable contribution to Hindi cinema, Nazir Hussain has a much bigger legacy in Bhojpuri cinema. The actor met India's first President Rajendra Prasad in the late 1950s and both of them discussed the possibility of making films in their mother toungue, the Bhojpuri language. Soon, Hussain began working on a script and made the first-ever film in Bhojpuri cinema, called Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo. Released in 1963, the movie was directed by Kundan Kumar. Apart from acting in it, Hussain owned the responsibility for the film from its inception to its release. He soon turned producer and started backing Bhojpuri films, which were not only commercial successes but were also praised for dealing with prevailing social issues. He was given the title of 'Pitamah of Bhojpuri cinema'.\nBy the early 1980s, the veteran actor cut down his work in films and his last on-screen appearance was in K. Asif's incomplete, long-delayed, and posthumously released Love and God in 1986. Nazir Hussain passed away in October 1987, aged 65.\n| Meet actor, who purposely failed MBBS exam, faked UPSC preparation, went on to win National Awards, is now OTT king",

    "text": "KAMLOOPS, B.C. — Vancouver's Catholic archdiocese is marking Easter with a commitment towards reconciliation with First Nations in B.C., Archbishop J. Michael Miller says.\nThe church and the chief of the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc announced Thursday that a \"Sacred Covenant\" agreement has been reached between the church and the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C.\nThe covenant comes three years after the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., announced the discovery of what it believed were the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school.\nMiller said the agreement with the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc will open a \"new chapter\" in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C.\n\"Unquestionably, the church was wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for many children, families and communities. We recognize as Catholics, as the Catholic Church, our part in the resulting tragedies,\" Miller said.\nThe covenant is set to be signed on Easter Sunday, \"a special time of hope and renewal,\" Miller said.\n\"Easter Sunday is the ideal time to help start a new chapter in First Nation and Catholic relations in our province,\" he said. \"Our hope and our prayer is that by taking this next step, we will build on our relationship, a relationship already established but still young, and be an example to Canadian society of respecting the identity and the experience of Indigenous Peoples.\"\nChief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc said the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing.\nCasimir said the agreement is crucial to learning the truth about what happened to the missing children, and access to the church's historical records will help \"bring justice to the children who never made it home.\"\n\"We seek to memorialize the missing children. We also seek meaningful ways to support survivors and intergenerational survivors on their healing journey so that they and their future generations may thrive,\" she said.\nThe nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found 200 potential unmarked burial sites.\nSince then, First Nations across the country have conducted searches and made similar discoveries.\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified at least 6,000 deaths at residential schools during their time in operation in Canada between the late 1800s and 1996.\nIn many of the deaths, schools didn’t record the children's names, genders or cause of death.\nThe children in the schools were separated from their families and forbidden to speak their own language. They were undernourished and often experienced physical and sexual abuse.\nThe agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and offering \"healing services\" to family members of those who attended the school.\nCasimir said the possible excavation of the Kamloops school site has not begun as it's a \"very sensitive step moving forward,\" that involves work with other nations, survivors and their families.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) y está escrito, en su libro mágico, que todos los no judíos existen para servir a los judíos.\nSu libro mágico es el bueno, los demás libros mágicos no.\n[#19](c19#c-19) En realidad sí, pero no te alarmes, no hay construcción de la identidad etnica de un grupo (y más si se trata de uno generalmente minoritario y perseguido)n sin su dosis de etnocentrismo.\nEn el caso de los creyentes en yahvé el resto de la humanidad es referida como “goyim”, o “gentiles” y no tiene connotaciones especialmente positivas.\n[#9](c9#c-9) [#19](c19#c-19) \"En la Torá se afirma claramente que el hombre fue creado con un propósito concreto: emular la justicia Divina sobre la Tierra. En un principio, toda la humanidad fue elegida para esta tarea. Sin embargo, los primeros hombres no dieron cumplimiento a esta, misión y permitieron que la- corrupción y la violencia predominaran sobre la justicia y la bondad. Por ese motivo, Dios determinó que se produjera el Gran Diluvio (Mabul) a fin de eliminar a los malvados. En lo sucesivo el castigo por incumplimiento se llevaría a cabo a nivel nacional y no universal. Por esa razón Dios eligió a una nación en particular para que cumpliera esta misión. El Pueblo Elegido seria una nación modelo de Dios sobre la Tierra y demostraría al resto de la humanidad cómo comportarse. Esta nación era la judía.\"\nhttps://www.tora.org.ar/pueblo-elegido-y-su-mision/\nSi eso no es considerar a un pueblo por encima del resto, da lugar a suficientes malas interpretaciones como para llamarles supemacistas.\nNo hay religión buena, no hay fanático respetable.\n[#51](c51#c-51) Qué curioso que un diós omni-de-todo ande con fallos de producción (los prototipos) y culpe de ello a sus creaciones.\nDiós: te voy a hacer libre... y te voy a colocar aquí el fruto del pecado. No lo toques, eh?\nEl Diablo, también creado por Diós, pero SIN que Diós se percate, dice: no seais pipas, esto mola.\nDiós: Malos! Me habeis desobedecido. Hala.... a la mierda. Pero es vuestra culpa, eh? Que quede claro. Y si os poneis cabezotas, mando a Abogados Cristianos a que se querellen.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\n[#39](c39#c-39) igual no tenía pilas el GPS porque se hace andando en 'algo menos' de 40 años\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/dir/Suez,+Gobernaci%C3%B3n+de+Suez,+Egipto/israel/@29.6717022,33.3954656,504278m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m16!4m15!1m5!1m1!1s0x1456257838ae4111:0x1f0a056a97ea1bc0!2m2!1d32.5498069!2d29.9668343!1m5!1m1!1s0x1500492432a7c98b:0x6a6b422013352cba!2m2!1d34.851612!2d31.046051!2m1!3b1!3e2?entry=ttu\n[#23](c23#c-23) No sé salvaron los que no quisieron realizar la Aliá (que empezó en 1840 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%C3%A1 ) y a esos que no se salvaron los llamaron los sacrificados o holocausto https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocausto_(sacrificio)\n[#57](c57#c-57) Será que entonces todos somos africanos..\nSiempre ha sido así. Si tu padre es judío pero tú madre no, no eres judío.\nOtra cosa son los judíos askenazis que no tienen origen semita pero ellos creen que sí cuando en verdad, tienen origen centroeuropeo (son la mayoría de la población actual de Israel) . O los judíos etíopes (betas) que mencionabas antes y que al ser negros, los tienen como judíos de segunda.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nSorpreson en Las Gaunas. A poco que se lea la biblia ya se sabe de que palo van.\nPero no les digas que es un plagio de la leyenda de Gilgamesh, el primer corta y pega de la historia.\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",
