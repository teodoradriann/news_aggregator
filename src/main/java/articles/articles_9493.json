WASHINGTON ( [Churchmilitant.com](https://www.churchmilitant.com/)) - A group of self-professed Catholic Democrats has released a letter entitled \" [Renewed Statement of Principles](https://delauro.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/delauro.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/renewed-statement-of-principles_0.pdf),\" which attempts to harmonize Catholic social teaching with killing babies. The lawmakers' statement, published on June 24, was chiefly organized by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, along with the pro-abortion group \"Catholics for Choice.\" It reads in part, \"Today, as Catholic Democrats serving in the House of Representatives, we are proud that we are part of the faithful pro-choice Catholic majority — 68 percent of whom supported the legal protections for abortion access enshrined in Roe and 63 percent of whom think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\" Led by Rep. DeLauro of Connecticut, the statement was signed by 30 other \"Catholic\" Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. The pro-abortion statement, which references the Catechism of the Catholic Church and Pope St. John Paul II, adds, \"Our faith unfailingly promotes the common good, prioritizes the dignity of every human being, and highlights the need to provide a collective safety net to our most vulnerable.\" The so-called statement of principles is an expansion on a [letter written two years ago](https://delauro.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/delauro-evo.house.gov/files/documents/Statement%20of%20Principles%206.18.21.pdf), wherein nearly 60 \"Catholic\" members of Congress clarified their support for abortion and called for American clergymen not to bar them from receiving Communion, saying, \"The Sacrament of Holy Communion is central to the life of practicing Catholics, and the weaponization of the Eucharist to Democratic lawmakers for their support of a woman's safe and legal access to abortion is contradictory.\" That 2021 statement, which was also spearheaded by DeLauro, was written in response to a decision by U.S. Catholic bishops to establish a teaching document on the nature of the Eucharist and its proper reception. The episcopal [document](http://www.usccb.org/resources/7-703%20The%20Mystery%20of%20Eucharist,%20for%20RE-UPLOAD,%20JANUARY%202022.pdf) The Mystery of the Eucharist in the Life of the Church ended up sidestepping the issue of pro-abortion politicians receiving Communion and failed to explicitly condemn the sacrilege. Rep. DeLauro resides in the archdiocese of Hartford, Connecticut, led by Abp. Leonard Blair. We— Jamie L. Manson (@jamielmanson) [@Catholic4Choice]were so proud to work in partnership with [@rosadelauro]’s office to craft this powerful statement. The 5 justices that struck down Roe are or were raised Catholic. So it is crucial that the pro-choice Catholic majority speak out. [https://t.co/bmTjreEmeC] [June 24, 2023] Although the recent statement from self-described Catholic lawmakers cites the Catechism and Pope John Paul II, these references were made in order to justify a \"right to abortion.\" The Catechism, however, [teaches](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2271.htm) that abortion is \"gravely contrary to the moral law\" and an \"abominable crime.\" Likewise, John Paul II [equated](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html) abortion to murder, adding that it's is a crime \"which no human law can claim to legitimize.\" Catholic laymen are calling upon Abp. Blair, along with his brother bishops, to respond to the letter. I am a Catholic—baptized, raised, and confirmed.— Rosa DeLauro (@rosadelauro) The fundamental tenets of my faith compel me to defend a women’s right to access abortion. I am proudly part of the faithful large majority of US Catholics who support legal protections for abortion access. Read my statement ⬇️ [June 26, 2023] In promoting the \"Renewed Statement of Principles\" letter, Rep. DeLauro [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/rosadelauro/status/1673471647708327944), \"I am a Catholic — baptized, raised and confirmed. The fundamental tenets of my faith compel me to defend a women's right to access abortion.\" This elicited an outrage from Catholics. Joshua Charles, former White House speechwriter, [responded](https://twitter.com/JoshuaTCharles/status/1673857762584043520), \"Repent.\" Jack Posobiec, senior editor at Human Events, [replied](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1673842596152745989), \"Not Catholic.\" And Mary Margaret Olohan, senior reporter at the Daily Signal, [wrote](https://twitter.com/MaryMargOlohan/status/1673826789175566342), \"This is complete BS.\" [Have a news tip?

The MF-STAR is designed to detect airborne targets such as aircraft, anti-ship missiles and cruise missiles which the MR-SAM is designed to shoot down at ranges in excess of 80 kilometres.

    "text": "El tiempo: sigue el calor y hay alerta en Mendoza por un elevado índice que genera riesgo para la salud\nLa temperatura bajará un poco, pero sigue el calor. El índice UV se mantiene altísimo y por eso la exposición al sol genera un alto riesgo.\nEl estado del tiempo en Mendoza será relativamente estable, pero con un dato importante. La temperatura máxima cederá un poco mañana, aunque el calor seguirán sintiéndose. Pero el pronóstico detallado indica que se mantiene un alerta más silenciosa, pero con alto riesgo para la salud: la exposición al sol. El índice UV, la forma de medir ese riesgo, tendrá un pico de 12 en Mendoza mañana, así como lo tuvo hoy. Es decir, es \"muy perjudicial para la salud\".\nEl pronóstico de la Dirección de Contingencias Climáticas indica para mañana que estará parcialmente nublado, pero caluroso durante todo el día. \"Parcialmente nublado y ventoso, vientos moderados del sector sur, descenso de la temperatura. Buen tiempo en cordillera. Máxima: 31ºC Mínima: 21ºC\", dice el informe.\nLas otras fuentes más detalladas advierten sobre el riesgo de exposición al sol, en especial al mediodía.\n\"Cuando el índice UV es alto, se recomienda tomar precauciones como utilizar protector solar y lentes de sol\", recomiendan. La escala es creciente, y Mendoza está al tope de riesgo. Para los índices que van entre 11-12, se considera riesgo extremo, con requerimiento de protección especial.\nEl sábado las condiciones serán similares, con un cielo \"parcialmente nublado con poco cambio de la temperatura, vientos moderados del sudeste\". El domingo el calor será más intenso, con una máxima de 35 grados. \"Caluroso con nubosidad variable y tormentas aisladas hacia la noche afectando principalmente el sur provincial, vientos leves del noreste. Desmejorando en cordillera\", indica el pronóstico.\nEl lunes el calor será aún más extremo. \"Caluroso e inestable con nubosidad variable y tormentas fuertes, vientos moderados del noreste rotando al sector sur.

    "text": "ESPN BET Promo Code ACTNEWS: Receive $150 in Bonus Bets for Any Sporting Event All Weekend\nThe ESPN BET promo code ACTNEWS has $150 in bonus bets waiting if you're a new user betting in a legal state. The betting site requires a minimum deposit of $10, but your first wager can be any amount to access the bonus bets.\nESPN BET immediately provides five $20 bonus bet increments. The remaining $50 bonus increment appears in your account within 24-48 hours of making your first bet. The initial wager and bonus bets can be used on any sporting event this weekend and beyond, though they do expire in seven days.\nWe must reiterate the ESPN BET promo code ACTNEWS because it's required to be entered during the signup process. You won't have access to the bonus bets if you don't enter \"ACTNEWS\" during registration.\nBelow, we'll examine Friday's sports slate and offer you a strong bonus bet pick.\nUsing our ESPN BET Promo on Friday Sports\nA great aspect of the ESPN BET welcome offer is that $100 of the $150 bonus bet becomes available immediately after your first bet. You don't need to wait for the first bet to settle to access the bonus. Let's assume you have the five $20 bonus increments for Friday night's NBA slate.\nYou can tune into ESPN tonight to watch the Knicks vs. 76ers (7:30 p.m. ET) and the Grizzlies vs. Lakers (10 p.m. ET). Philadelphia is a 6.5-point favorite, while the Lakers have a 4.5-point edge.\nNeither bet works great individually for our bonus bet, but we can combine them to form a parlay. That provides us with a strong bonus bet for ESPN BET.\n- Betting Pick: 76ers ATS + Lakers ATS (+290)\nPhiladelphia received a big boost with the return of Joel Embiid on Wednesday. Embiid's first game back from injury featured his second triple-double of the season. The Lakers have been shaky since winning the NBA In-Season Tournament, but this marks a good opportunity to turn things around against the Grizzlies.\nI recommend a parlay instead of a straight bet because of the +290 odds. The\n+EV betting guide suggests wagering on any market near +300 odds for a bonus bet. This ensures you're maximizing the value of a bonus, and the potential winnings are larger than the stake.\nYou lose the bonus bet stake no matter the outcome of your wager. Therefore, if you use a $20 bonus on this parlay, you'll either have $58.10 in winnings or nothing.\nHow to Sign Up for ESPN BET\n- Go to\nESPNBET.comor the app store.\n- Sign up using all your real info, including name, birthday, home address, phone number, and last four digits of your SSN.\n- Even if you had a Penn account, sign up for a new one using your same email address, and you'll get the bonus.\n- Enter ESPN BET promo code ACTNEWS while registering\n- Make any cash wager — it can be $1, can be $100, or whatever you'd like\n- Get $150 in bonus bets, split into five $20 increments and one $50 increment.\n- Use the bonus bets in 7 days, or they'll expire.\nNew users only, 21+. Gambling problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER. Must be physically present in AZ, CO, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, NJ, OH, PA, TN, VA, or WV in order to wager. Players must sign up using a specified Promotion code and then place an Eligible Wager on an Eligible Game during the Promotion Period. $150 (five (5) $20 Increments) of the $150 in Bonus Bets will be credited upon making the first bet.

While lower vertebrates like zebrafish and amphibians have RSCs, their existence in mammals has remained uncertain.\nIn a study published in Science Translational Medicine, scientists discovered a stem cell population in the retina of human fetuses, which they called human neural retinal stem-like cells (hNRSCs).2 The team also found that a common retinal organoid model contains a population of hNRSCs with a similar transcriptional profile. When researchers transplanted the organoid-derived cells into a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa, the treatment alleviated retinal degeneration and improved visual function. These findings provide a promising new approach for restoring vision in individuals with retinal diseases.\nIn the present study, Jianzhong Su and his colleagues at Wenzhou Medical University used single-cell and spatial transcriptomic sequencing to characterize gene expression in human retinal fetal samples that were donated following a terminated pregnancy. In doing so, they identified a distinct population of cells that could self-renew and develop into various cell types.\nThe use of fetal tissues remains controversial in the US and many other countries, making a different source of hNRSCs highly valuable. Human retinal organoids, which closely resemble the in vivo retina, offer a promising alternative for studying retinal development in vitro. Using human retinal organoids derived from a human embryonic stem cell line, the team identified a population of cells that had a similar transcriptional profile to hNRSCs in the fetal retina. The researchers transplanted these cells into a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa at two to three weeks of age, when retinal cell degeneration was already in process, and monitored them over the course of four months. The new cells differentiated and integrated into the host animals’ retinas and even formed functional synapses. Using an optomotor response assay, the researchers found a partial improvement in visual function in the hNRSC-treated mice.\nAlthough promising, further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying hNRSC-mediated retinal repair, as well as to test the cells in animal models of late-stage retinal degeneration. However, the authors hope their findings will deepen the field’s understanding of retinal biology and highlight the regenerative potential of hNRSCs.\n- Voisin A, et al.\nStem cell therapy in retinal diseases.

    "text": "Sandhill crane migration season in full swing\nWOOD RIVER, Neb. (KSNB) - It’s that time of year in Nebraska: Sandhill Crane migration season.\nReferred to as one of the most remarkable wildlife spectacles in North America, the cranes are briefly making the Platte River their home to fuel up for the rest of their journey up north.\n“The Sandhill Crane migration that is happening right now is where all the cranes that have gone south to Mexico and southern U.S. are going north,” said Matt Urbanski, marketing coordinator for the Crane Trust Nature and Visitor Center. “They’re stopping here for two to three weeks, getting fat off of corn, resting up and then flying all the way north to as far as Siberia, Canada and the northern United States.”\nEach crane spends around 29 days along the Platte River, resting and recharging while consuming an estimated 1,600 tons of corn during their stay.\n“What makes the central Platte River valley attractive to Sandhill Cranes is the river that we help manage,” Urbanski said. “We will make sure that there’s not a ton of vegetation choking the river out. We’ll make sure that it can widen, so the sandhill cranes have 6-8 inches of water to sit in during the night time.”\nWhile mid-March is the peak time to see the cranes, some will linger around until mid-April.\nCrane viewing destinations like the Crane Trust and Rowe Sanctuary provide a place for those looking to see the birds. But even outside of crane season, they have activities to offer.\n“Throughout the whole year, people come here to experience bison, go for hikes, see our art gallery, maybe buy something from the gift shop,” Urbanski said. “We even have people that didn’t expect to drop by the Crane Trust but we’re right off the interstate so they just come in, they explore, they use the restroom, they recharge and they head out.”\nThe Crane Trust is located off exit 305 on I-80, but during this time of year the cranes aren’t hard to find.\nClick here to subscribe to our KSNB Local4 daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2025 KSNB.

    "text": "Sir David Attenborough will present a National Geographic documentary about the health of the world’s oceans. The naturalist and broadcaster, 98, is known for BBC documentaries including Wild Isles and the Planet Earth series, which has won Bafta TV Craft awards. In the new feature-length documentary special, which has the working title David Attenborough: Ocean, Attenborough will expose the biggest problems facing our oceans during what he calls “the great age of ocean discovery”. Attenborough said: “My lifetime has coincided with the great age of ocean discovery. “Over the last hundred years, scientists and explorers have revealed remarkable new species, epic migrations and dazzling, complex ecosystems beyond anything I could have imagined as a young man. “In this film, we share those wonderful discoveries, uncover why our ocean is in such poor health and, perhaps most importantly, show how it can bounce back to life.” The special will show oceans across the Americas, Europe, Africa and Oceania and demonstrate the methods used to reverse harmful human activity along coral reefs, mangroves, coastal communities, fish farms, marine sanctuaries and other habitats. Tom McDonald, National Geographic’s executive vice president of global factual and unscripted content, said: “There is no-one better to deliver this landmark film than Sir David. “I have had the privilege and pleasure of working with him many times over the past decade, and so I am, of course, personally and professionally thrilled that he has agreed to work with National Geographic for the very first time on a subject that is timely and close to his heart.” The film will debut in cinemas in 2025 before premiering on National Geographic and streaming on Disney+.",

The proceeds from the match will benefit the victims of the catastrophic flooding that hit the area in June. Head coach Jess Thorup was without 12 first-team players as his side prepared to face last season's 3. Liga champions from Ulm during the international break. Several academy players were included in the matchday squad to take advantage of the opportunity to showcase themselves. A sell-out crowd of 2,500 packed into the GW-TEC Arena, home of TSV Dinkelscherben, on Thursday afternoon. FCA were able to open the scoring early on, as Ulm lost possession and had to rush to get back as Masaya Okugawa, Yusuf Kabadayi and Mahmut Kücüksahin combined quickly to get the ball to Arne Maier. The midfielder was able to slot home a shot into the bottom corner from 16 metres out (2'). Augsburg goalkeeper Daniel Klein then pulled off two saves in quick succession, before Kabadayi was able to add a second for FCA in the 25th minute. Not even 120 seconds later, the ball was in the back of the Ulm net again, as Maier bagged a brace. FCA found themselves 3-0 up inside 30 minutes, a lead which they would take into the half-time break. Gallery: BiFa FCASSV New signing Alexis Claude-Maurice was substituted on for his FCA debut after the interval. Klein did well to make a goalline save, but was helpless in the 72nd minute as Ulm's Lucas Röser was able to get a goal back for his side. Thorup's team hit back nearly immediately, with Tim Breithaupt converting a penalty after a handball inside the box (74'). FCA will be back in action following the international break as they go in search of their first win in the Bundesliga at home against FC St. Pauli on Sunday, 15th September (15:30 CEST). FCA: Klein, Gouweleeuw (59' Banks), Kabadayi (83' Cabrera), Maier (83' Lindermeir), Wolf (83' Lichtensteiger), Okugawa (46. Claude-Maurice), Breithaupt (83' Bleicher), Bauer (83' Rasoulinia), Schlotterbeck (83' Meiser), Kücuksahin (59' Heinze), Koudossou Goals: 1-0 Maier (2'), 2-0 Kabadayi (25'), 3-0 Maier (27'), 3-1 Röser (72'), 4-1 Breithaupt (76') Unsere FCA-APP Jetzt herunterladen!

    "text": "Esto es lo que dice la ley si un vecino moroso quiere convertirse en presidente de tu comunidad Sí, puede llegar a conseguirlo. Los vecinos morosos son un importante problema para las comunidades de vecinos, ya que suponen un lastre económico que dificulta que se puedan afrontar pagos necesarios para el edificio. Sin embargo, las complicaciones pueden ser aún mayores si ese vecino moroso se convierte en [presidente de la comunidad](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/sociedad/una-abogada-alerta-desconocidos-riesgos-penales-presidente-comunidad-vecinos.html). El motivo es que reclamarle el pago de lo adeudado se convertirá en una misión imposible, ya que para iniciar un procedimiento judicial se necesita la firma del presidente. Y aunque pueda sonar extraño, sí, es legal que ese individuo que no paga sus cuotas pueda llegar a comandar la comunidad. El artículo 15 de la [Ley de Propiedad Horizontal](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1960-10906) estipula, en cuanto a los derechos de los vecinos morosos en las juntas, que “los propietarios que en el momento de iniciarse la junta no se encontrasen al corriente en el pago de todas las deudas vencidas con la comunidad y no hubiesen impugnado judicialmente las mismas o procedido a la consignación judicial o notarial de la suma adeudada, podrán participar en sus deliberaciones si bien no tendrán derecho de voto”. En consecuencia, un vecino moroso no puede votar hasta que se ponga al corriente de pagos, pero sí que puede ser elegido como presidente de la comunidad. En ese sentido, cabe destacar que es difícil que un vecino que no cumple con su aportación económica a la comunidad sea elegido como presidente gracias a que el resto de vecinos le voten. Pero los problemas pueden llegar si se recurre a otras de las fórmulas posibles para designar al presidente. “El presidente será nombrado, entre los propietarios, mediante elección o, subsidiariamente, mediante turno rotatorio o sorteo. El nombramiento será obligatorio”, señala la Ley de Propiedad Horizontal en su artículo 13. Por lo tanto, es posible que esa rotación o sorteo pueda dar como resultado que un vecino moroso sea nombrado como presidente de la comunidad. En ese supuesto, lo más recomendable es que algún vecino se presente como voluntario para ocupar el cargo.",
