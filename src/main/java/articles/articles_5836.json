    "title": "The Rise of Carbon Pricing: Financing a Greener Future",
    "text": "In the midst of an evolving global economy, one element stands out for its increasing importance and potential for profound impact: carbon pricing. As nations grapple with the dual challenges of stimulating economic growth and achieving decarbonization, the spotlight has turned to the mechanisms of carbon pricing. This financial tool, designed to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, has seen significant developments and achievements in 2022, raising substantial funds and steering investments towards cleaner, greener technologies.\nThe Surge of Global Carbon Pricing Mechanisms\nThroughout 2022, the world witnessed a notable surge in the implementation and refinement of carbon pricing strategies. Countries and regions have been pioneering to establish systems that not only levy a price on carbon emissions but also incentivize the transition towards renewable energy sources. This movement is not just about penalizing polluters; it's about fostering a global shift towards sustainable development and innovation in green technologies. The raised funds are pivotal, channeling billions into the green transition, marking a clear signal of the world's commitment to combating climate change.\nThe Role of Carbon Markets in Decarbonization\nAt the heart of carbon pricing lies the carbon market, a concept that has proven instrumental in driving investments towards decarbonization efforts. By setting a market price on carbon emissions, these mechanisms make it financially sensible for companies to lower their carbon footprint. The goal is clear: to turn the tide against climate change by making it economically advantageous to invest in clean energy and efficient technologies. As the world gears up for the UN COP29 climate negotiations, the urgency to finalize international carbon market rules has never been more pronounced. Such advancements are crucial for establishing a fair global carbon price, stimulating innovation, and solidifying commitments to a sustainable future.\nCarbon Pricing: Financing the Low-Carbon Transition\nAround the globe, diverse approaches to carbon pricing are emerging, each tailored to the unique economic and environmental contexts of different countries and regions. Despite the variations, the underlying principle remains consistent: to use economic incentives to reduce carbon emissions and finance the transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2022, significant amounts of money were raised through carbon pricing mechanisms, underscoring the vital role these funds play in environmental projects, renewable energy development, and climate change mitigation efforts. With the next government NZU auction scheduled for March, anticipation is building around the potential for these mechanisms to further bolster the fight against climate change.\nAs the dialogue around carbon pricing continues to evolve, it is clear that these mechanisms are more than just financial tools; they are the linchpins of the global response to climate change. By incentivizing reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and driving investments towards sustainable technologies, carbon pricing stands at the forefront of the world's efforts to secure a greener, more resilient future. The developments in 2022, including the significant funds raised and the push for a fair global carbon price, highlight the critical role of carbon markets in the environmental and economic landscape. As nations gather for the upcoming UN COP29 climate negotiations, the world watches with bated breath, hopeful for progress that will solidify the path towards decarbonization and a sustainable global economy.",

    "title": "$50 a week for 40 weeks: How no-strings cash changed the lives of teens",
    "text": "Education\n$50 a week for 40 weeks: How no-strings cash changed the lives of teens\nNEW ORLEANS - Kapri Clark used the $50 to help pay for her braces. Lyrik Grant saved half of it, and used the rest for dance classes. Kevin Jackson said he squandered the cash, on wings, ride shares for dates and some DJ equipment he later tossed.\nFor the past five years, Clark, Grant, Jackson and hundreds of high schoolers in New Orleans have shopped - or saved - as part of a project to explore what happens if you give cash directly to young people, no strings attached.\n\"That was the most helpful thing ever,\" said Clark, now a student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, who said she could still use that extra cash.\n\"The $50 study,\" as it's known, began at Rooted School, a local charter school, as an experiment to increase attendance. The study has since grown to eight other high schools in the city, as well as Rooted's sister campus in Indianapolis, with students randomly selected to receive $50 every week for 40 weeks, or $2,000 total. By comparing their spending and savings habits to a larger control group, researchers wanted to figure out whether the money improved a teen's financial capability and perception of themselves. They also wanted to know: Could the cash boost their grade-point averages and reading scores?\nNow, as the experiment expands to Washington, D.C., and perhaps Texas, a final report of the $50 study suggests a little bit of spending cash can make a difference in young people's lives.\nThe report, released Tuesday, shows students who received the cash payments were slightly more likely to attend school than those who didn't. Academic performance did not differ between the groups. But financially, the extra cash helped students acquire stronger long-term planning skills and familiarity with savings accounts and other financial products. They ended the study, on average, with $300 saved away - a 15 percent savings rate, triple the national average for American adults.\n\"When young people are given the opportunity to manage money in low-stakes environments, they build the habits that shape long-term financial health,\" said Stacia West, an associate professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and co-founder of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research, which partnered with the Rooted School Foundation to run the study. \"The short-term habits we're seeing are laying the foundation for lifelong financial capability.\"\nRelated: A lot goes on in classrooms from kindergarten to high school. Keep up with our free weekly newsletter on K-12 education.\nAcross the United States and the globe, hundreds of communities have tinkered with some form of universal basic income, or UBI, a social welfare program that provides people with regular cash payments to meet their needs. Direct cash transfer programs like the $50 study or the child tax credit for families are similar, but they often provide smaller amounts and target specific populations to boost a person's income. Many studies have linked UBI to financial stability and better employment and health outcomes.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, researchers have found links between cash transfer pilots that focus on low-income families and better test scores and graduation rates for their kids. So far, though, few experiments have targeted young people or examined how the programs influence their lives specifically.\n\"There's a deep, deep distrust that we adults have of young people,\" said Jonathan Johnson, CEO of the Rooted School Foundation, which operates the network's four charter schools. \"That distrust is to their detriment.\"\nIn New Orleans, roughly 4 in 5 of Rooted students come from economically disadvantaged families, and during the pandemic, many struggled to prioritize school. Some students skipped class to provide child care for their working parents, or because they needed to work themselves, according to Johnson. With some seed funding from a local education nonprofit, Rooted started a \"micropilot\" to test whether cash could help students make ends meet and get themselves to school.\nThe original cohort included 20 students, half of whom received the $50 payment. In that micropilot, those receiving the cash saw their material wellbeing improve, meaning their family could more easily afford rent or utilities, and they gained skills around setting financial goals. Rooted added students from its Indianapolis campus and another high school in New Orleans, G.W. Carver. And for their final report released this week, researchers sifted through the spending and survey data from 170 students who received the cash payments and 210 students who did not.\nThe two-year report found students in the treatment group attended 1.23 more days of school, and spent close to half their funds on essentials like food and groceries. The report also noted that 70 percent of all students at the participating schools qualify for subsidized meals, suggesting \"this spending may reflect efforts to meet immediate nutritional needs.\" One 12th grader in a survey mentioned using the money to feed their siblings.\nKapri Clark recalled waiting every Wednesday morning for the $50 deposit to appear in her banking app. And every Wednesday afternoon, during her senior year at Carver High School, she put that money toward her $200 bill for braces she covered out of pocket.\nShe braided hair to cover the rest, and still books clients when she has time in between her studies to become a nurse at the Lafayette campus. Even in college, Clark can see the need for some supplemental income for herself and her peers.\n\"I make enough to take care of myself, but I watch every dollar,\" said Clark. \"There's a lot of people struggling in life to eat, to live. Think if they got kids.\"\nRead Irvin, chief of staff for Collegiate Academies in New Orleans, a network of five charter high schools that includes Carver High, said the $2,000 had provided the extra incentive a few students needed to stick it out until graduation. \"That's incredibly impactful for their life trajectories,\" she said.\nRelated: How to help young kids: Give their parents cash\nIn January 2024, the city of New Orleans invested $1 million to bankroll another extension of the study, as part of an economic mobility initiative that tapped federal Covid relief funding. During the pandemic, a skyrocketing murder rate and spike in overall crime had convinced the city to help more residents, especially young people, find stability.\n\"Research shows that people who are economically stable are less likely to commit crime,\" said Courtney Wong, the city's deputy director of economic development.\nThe city funding not only expanded the $50 study to nine high schools, it also set a longer timeline for the research: About 800 seniors who participate will have their data tracked for 18 months after their graduation.\nA former high school teacher and administrator, Wong said $50 could have made a difference in the lives of many of her former students.\n\"This targets young people in that perfect moment,\" she said. \"They're in the right spot where even a little amount of help could have big, positive impacts before issues of crime or unemployment or things like that even come up.\"\nResearchers also found students who received the $50 reported greater agency. They felt more control over their finances and more confidence about making long-term financial decisions. Students, according to the report, aligned their spending to future goals such as college prep classes and getting a driver's license.\nLyrik Grant, a rising junior at Carver High School, is the second-youngest of six kids with two working parents. She could ask them for help, but the $50 allowed Grant to afford the tights and tops she needed for dance class on her own. The money helped cover a college entrance exam, which she aced, and Grant wants to learn how to drive soon.\n\"My first thought was: What am I going to do with all this money?\" Grant said, adding that the cash helped some of her classmates find financial stability. \"Children don't always want to spend their parent's money, and some parents don't always have money to give them.\"\nStill, for some students, the money wasn't exactly life-changing. Irvin of Collegiate Academies said many used the cash to \"just be teenagers.\"\nThat was true for Kevin Jackson, a rising junior at Rooted School New Orleans.\n\"It's cool to get free money,\" he said. \"I was spending it on the TikTok shop: posters, keyboards, lights - stuff I liked, not stuff I actually needed.\"\nRelated: All-charter no more: New Orleans opens its first traditional school in nearly two decades\nDespite the studies that show a positive impact from UBI, many Americans appear skeptical of the idea of a federal program that gives unconditional financial support to people. Aditi Vasan, a pediatrician and researcher at PolicyLab at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said skeptics often worry about recipients using public dollars for drug use or other illicit behavior, even though the data does not support that.\nStill, that fear will likely keep any large-scale cash transfer program from being adopted in the United States any time soon, she said.\n\"That concern exists certainly for cash transfers in general but might be particularly magnified for teens,\" Vasan said. \"We've not seen that play out in the evidence from the quality studies that have been done.\"\nNext year, in Washington, D.C., the nonprofit Education Forward will fund a pilot of the $50 study with 40 high schoolers. The Rooted school network resumed talks, meanwhile, to take the study to neighboring Texas, after state lawmakers earlier this year failed to pass legislation that threatened to ban local governments from adopting guaranteed income programs.\nTalia Livneh, senior director of programs for the Rooted School Foundation, said the politics may need to catch up to the research.\n\"I don't think what we're doing is so radical. I believe this just works,\" she said. \"Kids don't lack character. They lack cash,\" Livneh added. \"They deserve deep, deep trust that students and people know what's best for them.\"\nIt's been four years since Vernell Cheneau III received the $50 for 40 weeks while a student at Rooted in New Orleans, and his economic life isn't easy. He struggled for months to find part-time work in his hometown. But on a recent summer morning, the same day he finally received a job offer, Cheneau recalled what he learned from the study.\n\"You learn that money goes fast, especially if it's free,\" said Cheneau, 22.\nAs a student, he tried to use the money to build some credit history. Since then, he's learned the full cost of being an adult in America: health care, fuel and maintenance for his car, getting your hair done before a new job. Cheneau has also spent that time trying to convince friends and family to support UBI.\nMost oppose giving \"free\" money to people, he said. \"How much does it cost to feed children? Get to work? We can't just allow people to drown.\"\n\"Everything costs something,\" Cheneau added. \"If you're stuck in a rut, it's expensive to restart. In this country, it's expensive to be poor.\"\nContact staff writer Neal Morton at 212-678-8247, on Signal at nealmorton.99, or via email at morton@hechingerreport.org.\nThis story about cash transfer programs was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

    "text": "What to know about Christian Yelich's back injury, severity of it, Brewers depth in outfield without him The Milwaukee Brewers [lost their best hitter, Christian Yelich, to the 10-day injured list Wednesday](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2024/07/24/brewers-christian-yelich-goes-on-injured-list-with-lower-back-injury/74524596007/) with lower back inflammation, but the recurring injury is likely to sideline him for much longer than 10 days. Milwaukee is staring down the loss of Yelich for the rest of 2024. Here's what we know about Yelich's injury. What exactly is the injury to Christian Yelich's back, and what did Christian Yelich say about it? Is he out for the year? The Brewers have never revealed overly detailed specifics about the injury that has been hampering Yelich for years, but Brewers manager Pat Murphy said Wednesday that a nerve issue is involved, and Yelich will see a specialist in Milwaukee to consider next steps. [Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5656815/2024/07/24/christian-yelich-brewers-back-injury/) reported that season-ending surgery is on the table, and Yelich's words seem to indicate that level of gravity. “Go from there, as far as what's gonna be the best for the near future and into the future,” Yelich said. “So a couple of different discussions I think that need to be had. And kind of try to see where we're going from that. “I don’t really want to get into the specifics of it, but, yeah, not great.\" Murphy said, \"For what Yeli does for this lineup and this clubhouse, I don’t know there’s too many players who can replace him. ... This is huge, no matter how serious. Whatever number of games we lose him for, it’s serious.\" When has Christian Yelich been sidelined by the back injury before? Yelich missed a month of the season with a back issue from April 12 to May 8, which came as a stunner because he had started the year on fire through the first 10 games, with a 1.146 OPS. He has been on the injured list with a back issue four times before but has never required surgery. Upon his return, Yelich continued his steady play in his best season since the 2019 campaign, in which he took second in the National League Most Valuable Player voting. His .315 batting average and .406 on-base percentage are both tops in the National League. The back issue has been tricky to negotiate. In 2023, he was sidelined briefly in May and then [for a week beginning Sept. 8 in the throes of a playoff chase](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2023/09/21/what-we-know-about-brewers-outfielder-christian-yelichs-back-injury/70918452007/) and, though he returned for one game Sept. 15, he was on the bench for another week immediately after that when the back issue recurred. A similar thing happened early in 2021, when Yelich came off the injured list in May for one game and [went right back onto it with the back injury.](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2021/05/04/christian-yelich-back-brewers-injured-list-after-1-game-return/4935665001/) Was the back injury a result of the catastrophic knee injury Christian Yelich suffered in 2019? Yelich's injury history includes an unforgettable bad break in 2019, when he fouled a ball off his knee and shattered his knee cap, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. The Brewers went on to lose in the wild-card game in dramatic fashion to Washington, which went on to win the World Series. Yelich famously couldn't recapture his MVP form in the aftermath. After he signed a long-term extension before 2020, he struggled in the year abbreviated by COVID-19 and wasn't anywhere near the same MVP caliber of play in 2021 and 2022. But he bounced back nicely in 2023 (.818 OPS) and took yet another step forward into his 2024 season, even at age 32. But the back issue predates the knee injury. In fact, [he missed five games in April of 2019](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2019/04/30/notes-christian-yelich-could-miss-entire-series-against-rockies/3624784002/) with a lower back issue. He missed a [couple more games in May](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2019/05/21/brewers-christian-yelich-held-out-tuesday-vs-reds-back-spasms/3750777002/). When he missed four games in August with the same issue, the team admitted [there was no way of knowing when he might be back](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2019/08/07/christian-yelich-remains-out-back-issue-no-way-predict-return/1893207001/); it was simply an injury that could turn a corner at any moment. That's been a familiar refrain with the back issue — an uncertainty of timeline. Should Christian Yelich have skipped the All-Star game? There's zero indication that Yelich appearing in the All-Star game July 16 made the situation worse, although he'd been 0-for-9 since the all-star break and mired in a 1-for-19 slump that extended to the games before the break. Remember, the issue has come and gone on a moment's notice, and the All-Star game is mild workload compared to a regular-season game. Yelich grounded out twice in the All-Star game and played right field, fielding a line-drive single in the third and a slow-rolling single in the fifth. It was the only time he's played the field since July 9, slotting in as the designated hitter for all the Brewers games since. He had been given a day off July 13 against the Nationals in a loss but played in the July 14 finale, the last game before the break, and he also appeared in the first game after the break and played all 12 innings in a July 20 win over the Twins, laying down a bunt that accounted for a run in extras. He was then held out of the next game July 21. What are Christian Yelich's stats this year? His .909 OPS is the highest he's had in his career, except for only his back-to-back incredible seasons in Milwaukee, the 2018 MVP season and the 2019 follow-up that was ended prematurely by the knee injury. In those seasons, he hadd OPS marks of 1.000 and 1.100. It would be the best season OPS for any Brewers season from a player age 32 or older with at least 200 plate appearances. Russell Branyan, who had a .925 OPS at age 32 in 2008 over 152 plate appearances, is the only better mark of any player with at least 80 at-bats. Ryan Braun had a .903 OPS in 2016 at age 32, and Aramis Ramírez had a .901 at age 34 in 2012. By OPS+, a metric that attempts to account for a player's ballparks, it's tied for the best 32-and-over mark in franchise history with Robin Yount, who was 33 in 1989 when he matched Yelich's OPS-plus of 152. Yelich this season has 11 home runs, 42 RBIs and 21 stolen bases. He would have been in line for a third career batting title at .315 but is unlikely to have enough plate appearances now to qualify for that title. What is Christian Yelich's contract? Yelich signed a seven-year deal before the 2020 season worth $188.5 million, paying him $22 million a year, and kicking in during the 2022 season. He's owed $22 million a year for 2025-28, and then a mutual option for $20 million in 2029 (or a buyout for $6.5 million). If both sides pick up the option, he becomes an unrestricted free agent in 2030. Is Christian Yelich a Hall of Famer? In 2019, [there was a very real case](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2019/06/28/christian-yelich-squarely-track-reach-hall-fame/1479878001/) that he was on track to be a Hall of Famer, but the struggles in subsequent years — exacerbated in no small part by his back issues — have knocked him off-course. According to most metrics that track Hall of Fame likelihood, compiled at [Baseball-Reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/y/yelicch01.shtml), Yelich is well short of the standard. Through age 31, his offensive profile is most similar to players like Andrew McCutchen, Matt Kemp, Vernon Wells and Gary Matthews. What is the Brewers' outfield depth chart in Christian Yelich's absence? The Brewers are comfortable with outfield depth, although nobody will be able to match Yelich's offense. Since Yelich has been mostly as a DH lately, it's given ample playing time to surging rookie corner outfielder Jackson Chourio, plus young speedsters Garrett Mitchell and Sal Frelick, with Blake Perkins as a suitable backup at any spot (particularly center field). In the minors, the team still has right-handed hitter Joey Wiemer, a regular contributor on last year's team, who has a .733 OPS in Class AAA Nashville, with only three homers this season in 50 games. The franchise added Brewer Hicklen, another right-handed bat, to the 40-man roster during the all-star break, and he's had a strong season at AAA. The 28-year-old corner outfielder has a .951 OPS at Nashville, with 19 homers and 28 stolen bases in 77 games. Signed as a free agent in November 2023, Hicklen was invited to spring training — [and made an impression](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2024/02/24/brewer-hicklen-hopes-dream-becomes-a-reality-in-milwaukee/72715702007/) — but has just four big-league at-bats, coming over the course of six games with Kansas City in 2022.",

    "text": "(The Center Square) – Chicago activist Tio Hardiman is urging CTA rail workers to come together in their battle with management aimed at keeping them safe and protected while on the job. Over the last two weeks, at least five people have been shot, four of them fatally, on or near the rail system, leaving many workers and riders alike shaken and traumatized by the thought of boarding a CTA train. “What I would say to the workers on CTA is to organize and schedule a meeting with the president of CTA,” Hardiman told The Center Square. \"There should be hundreds of CTA workers to meet with him and just tell them straight forward ‘if you don't get this security thing under control basically we're going to go on strike. Let them know unequivocally, if you don't address this the proper way we need to hire somebody in that position.” Amalgamated Transit Union Local 308 president/business agent Pennie McCoach adds things have gotten so out of control on the rails that workers are afraid to report for duty, forcing the union to have already broached the idea with management of adding security officers on the system that have the power to make arrests As the longtime executive director of Violence Interrupters, Hardiman insists his crew is ready for action when it comes to easing tensions. “I extended another offer to help CTA reduce gun violence and reduce overall violence on their train systems,” he said. “There's a need for an extra level of violence prevention efforts to take place on the CTA. I know for a fact we have a proven model that gets results and we can board them trains and help people feel good about riding those trains.” In the Blue Line shooting that left four people died, police have charged 30-year-old Rhanni Davis with four counts of first-degree murder, adding at least three of the victims were asleep on the train when he opened fire. Soon after word of the random attack began to spread, CTA officials revealed the agency is now using Zero Eyes safety technology that can detect guns on train platforms with the technology working by sending an alert to CTA security and CPD via the agency’s existing camera system once a gun is detected in the station. Presently, the surveillance is only being used in about 250 of the agency’s 33,000 cameras, though authorities have been secretive about which stations as the program remains in the pilot phase.",

    "title": "Bluesky feels more like old Twitter than X does",
    "text": "In the two years since Elon Musk bought Twitter and turned it into X, the platform has become crowded with deceptive ads and unchecked misinformation. Now, with President-elect Donald Trump heading to the White House and Musk joining his administration, countless people announced their departure from X. Rival social media site Bluesky told Vox that 2.25 million new users have joined in the last week alone. And they’re having a blast.\nBluesky looks a lot like the old Twitter you knew and loved. It’s a reverse chronological feed of posts, including images, videos, and links that you can like and repost. Like old Twitter, your feed is not ruled by an algorithm. Meanwhile, Bluesky’s open source, decentralized framework gives you a lot more control over how your feed works than X or even Threads, the X alternative Meta has been pushing onto Instagram users.\nIn addition to the technical differences, there’s also a different vibe on Bluesky. It’s overflowing with weird memes and digital art thanks to early users who hurried to recapture that fun and serendipitous feeling of the original Twitter. But with an influx of a million users in the last month, Bluesky is growing fast and bracing for some sort of evolution. The people arriving from X seem like they’re having fun so far, too. You can also expect to see a lot less Elon Musk on Bluesky, if only because he doesn’t own the place.\nIf the good vibes continue, there’s a chance that Bluesky could usher in a brighter future for social media, one that gives users more power over their experience. Theoretically, the company’s model could give people a way to hang out on the social web outside of algorithmic feeds stuffed with targeted ads and ruled by trillion-dollar tech companies. For now, at the very least, Bluesky is a welcome breath of fresh air.\nWhy people are fleeing X\nThis isn’t the first time people have flocked to Bluesky. When Twitter accepted Elon Musk’s $44 billion bid to buy Twitter in April 2022, a lot of people freaked out about the possibility of the billionaire changing the platform into a place where trolls and grifters could run free — all in the name of free speech. Those initial anxieties turned out to be correct. After Musk changed the name to X, what used to be Twitter filled up with white supremacists and became overrun with harassment, AI slop, and election misinformation.\nThis overhaul turned into a huge opportunity for open source, text-based social networks, like Mastodon and Bluesky. Early on, it looked like the decidedly decentralized Mastodon would be the Twitter alternative of choice, but after it saw an initial burst of interest, some people felt like Mastodon was just too confusing. As a federated network, Mastodon let people set up their own servers, which functioned as independent but interconnected communities within the larger network. It’s related to the larger concept of the fediverse, where a single protocol could allow information to be exchanged between all social media platforms. The fediverse, like Mastodon, is very confusing.\nBluesky took this idea of a federated network and made it easy to use. It started back in 2019, when Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter would fund a small team that would build an “open and decentralized standard for social media.” The ambition — which would eventually result in Bluesky — was to work toward an open social media ecosystem, where users could control how content appeared in their feeds and take their data and followers with them when they moved platforms. Bluesky registered as its own public benefit company in February 2022, just a couple of months before Musk offered to buy Twitter.\nThe first Bluesky app launched in beta about a year later, and it looked a heck of a lot like Twitter, down to the blue logo, which would become a butterfly rather than Twitter’s bird. Rather than require you to figure out which server to join, as Mastodon does, Bluesky initially centralized the user experience on one server so users could see one feed, just like on Twitter. Within a few months, some prominent Twitter users, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Chrissy Teigen, had set up Bluesky accounts.\nBluesky has only gotten easier to use since its early days. While the company announced it was federating earlier this year, allowing users to store their data on their own servers, the Bluesky user experience remains very straightforward and Twitter-like, down to the look and feel of the app and website. Honestly, if you’re not paying attention while you’re scrolling your feed, you might think you’re on Twitter circa 2021.\nThat said, the future of Bluesky is supposed to be transformative. While social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have been plagued by content moderation problems, Bluesky wants to put users and communities in control of those policies. The same goes for what shows up in people’s feeds. Bluesky says that instead of one algorithm to rule all users, it will let developers create all kinds of different algorithms and empower users to choose their own experience on the platform.\n“I’m really excited that folks can choose the social media that’s right for them. I’ll say for me, I like small social media where I talk to barely a dozen people,” Rory Mir, associate director of community organizing at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said of Bluesky’s open source architecture. “And then if folks want a really big audience and to really blow up that’s also available.”\nThis is not how Bluesky works for everyone quite yet. You can just set up an account, follow a bunch of people, and then see their posts. But looking ahead, Bluesky has an optimistic vision for a near future in which social media doesn’t make people so miserable.\nFor new users, Bluesky’s appeal is all about the culture\nTiming has proven crucial to Bluesky’s current position as the X alternative du jour — that is, it’s had a significant amount of time to gather momentum leading to what seems to be this tipping point moment.\nWhen the platform launched over 18 months ago, it was as an invite-only space, prompting extremely online types and various public figures to flock to try to get in. (The fact many of those early adopters were journalists didn’t hurt in terms of building hype.) That long period of limited entry served to build FOMO, of course, but it also served to allow a niche group of users time to help shape what the dominant modes of communication, moderation, and platform etiquette would be.\n“The health and positivity of Bluesky’s community is very important to us, and we’ve invested heavily in Trust and Safety,” Bluesky spokesperson Emily Liu told Vox in an email. “Last year, Bluesky required invite codes to sign up — not to build hype or exclusivity, but rather so we had time to grow the network responsibly and build our Trust and Safety team.”\n“When Musk first bought Twitter, the first things he did were rolling back moderation on transphobia on the platform and because of that we were the first group to leave Twitter in numbers,” journalist Katelyn Burns told Vox. “Because of that, a large group of funny, talented trans posters were the earliest adopters of Bluesky and were able to forge the platform into what it is today: funny, frequently horny, and with very strong moderation tools. If you like Bluesky’s vibe right now, thank a trans person.”\nWhen the platform finally opened to the public in February, this culture was already well-established: Lots of shitposting passed down from the days of Weird Twitter (including various Alf memes that recently led to some confusion); a seemingly inevitable leftist tilt; a subcommunity of NSFW posters; and, perhaps most important, an emphasis on proactively curating your own experience using Bluesky’s robust moderation tools.\nThe centrality of these tools are arguably the defining trait that allows Bluesky to stand out, especially compared to Twitter, which struggled for its entire existence to properly deal with bad actors on the site (until Musk more or less jettisoned that struggle altogether). Bluesky not only allows you to block and mute various people, words, and tags, it also allows you to hide individual posts on feeds, and allows users to subscribe to curated block lists directly from the platform that blocks users en masse.\n“To me the biggest difference between Bluesky and every other social media platform I’ve ever been on is the close relationship between the user base and the (quite small!) team of developers,” journalist and longtime Bluesky shitposter Miles Klee told Vox.\n“When people first joined, it was very bare bones, and the devs pursued new features according to what they heard users wanted. Because a lot of people were looking to escape the toxicity of X, that meant they ended up prioritizing safety and accessibility,” Klee said. “On Bluesky, many users feel that they’re building something new together, and that gives them a feeling of ownership, control, community.”\n“I adore Bluesky,” author and Bluesky user Debbie Ridpath Ohi told Vox. “While so many other new platforms chased user numbers, Bluesky focused on user safety first, and that made a huge difference. I am having fun using social media again.”\nBluesky does have one significant drawback. Because the platform is federated, accounts can’t be “locked” away from public view the way they can on X. Still, for many people, that’s likely a feature rather than a bug; after all, X’s easily accessible public interface and ease of searching and surfacing content made it indispensable to many users, especially the many journalists who used it and still continue to use it. These are all features that Bluesky replicates — without, so far, the endless trolls that came with X’s recent era.\nWhat it means to leave Twitter\nFor people who have spent many years on Twitter — which launched in 2006, enough time to grow into an impossible teenager — it may be sobering to contemplate actually leaving the platform. This is, after all, the supposed “hellsite” that many of its most active users were all but glued to for everything from live events to hilarious viral incidents that found us all united through the power of a virtually instantaneous, public, and collective social media.\nYet for the vast majority of users, the thought of leaving X now probably feels much more plausible and realistic a possibility than it did a year ago, when Vox first declared that X was in its death throes. That’s not unusual; social media platforms very rarely die instantly.\nFor the most part, platforms don’t suddenly shut down and strand all of their users. That only happens in extreme cases when a platform’s systems collapse, or it’s seized by the government, or the owner kills the site — situations that just don’t really happen to modern social media with complex infrastructure. The inverse scenario, in which all of a platform’s users simply give up and leave en masse overnight, doesn’t happen at all.\nInstead, as we’ve seen across various internet platforms, including mass migrations away from LiveJournal, Tumblr, Facebook, and now X, the exodus takes years and involves multiple inciting incidents that push people out of their comfort zone and off the platform in incremental movements. All of these steps shift users slowly and inevitably toward the decision to fully leave a platform — sometimes before they even realize they’ve made it.\n“Social media is, by definition, social,” Bluesky early adopter Maura Quint told Vox. “People want to be at places where they get something from other users, and where the tools the site provides help them have the experience they’re looking for. If people are miserable in a space, they leave.”\n“Elon Musk made sure to design his version of Twitter to be an unpleasant, dull place,” Quint continued. “Why choose an awful room run by the worst guy you’ve ever met when there’s an alternative where cool people are hanging out, telling jokes, creating their own goofy lore, and engaging on issues they care about?”\nAs a platform slips into decline, those inciting incidents often become more and more frequent and close together. X has had multiple such inciting incidents this year, including a major ban in Brazil that sent 500,000 users to Bluesky in a single weekend in August, a crucial step in jolting X’s massive international fandom community out of its complacency. Then came the twin announcements in October: first, that X would be allowing third-party AI companies to scrape all user data, and then that blocking a user would no longer prevent them from being able to see your content — a change that arguably nullifies the point of blocking to begin with. Most recently came the US election and Musk’s unabashed weaponization of the platform in service of Trump and the far right.\nThis latest inciting incident seems to have been the final straw for many users to not only leave X for Bluesky, but begin deleting all of their content from X. (Some extensions and apps allow you to import all of your content over from X to Bluesky first before you delete.) Still, while these actions suggest that momentum has well and truly shifted toward Bluesky, the newer site will likely have growing pains as old users adjust to newcomers and the platform itself grapples with the strain of millions of new users.\n“Our infrastructure is holding up!” Bluesky’s Liu told Vox. “We’ve prepared our infrastructure to be able to handle this demand, though there are definitely a lot of new users signing up right now.” She added that the site is building a subscription model to aid sustainability, though the site will always be free to use.\nDespite the rapid growth, users are optimistic about the future. “Every influx of users brings with it more voices, some with good intent and some with bad intent, but Bluesky is responsive to the people who use it in ways that encourage people to stick around,” Quint said. “When you compare that to sites where white nationalists organize mass attacks, spending money lets anyone drown out real discussion, and mass disinformation spreads at the whim of a billionaire, Bluesky is clearly the place to be.”\nThe post Bluesky feels more like old Twitter than X does appeared first on Vox.",

    "text": "A few years ago, I was in very bad health. I weighed 287 pounds. I had asthma, high blood pressure, and diabetes. My wife, Susana, and I have three great kids: Jovanna, Joseph, and Jackely. But I didn’t have energy for them and I used to eat out at least three times a week. I’m 39, and I wanted to lose weight, but my challenge was being consistent with dietary changes. I was affected physically and emotionally by the weight gain — I had low self-esteem. So I decided to start the Thrive Challenge. My food choices have changed. I have specific times for my meals — I take my time and enjoy my food. I added more protein to my diet, like chicken, turkey, and salmon, as well as good fats like olive and avocado oil. And I’m eating lots of fruit and veggies. For breakfast, I have egg whites a la Mexicana, and for lunch I’ll have tuna salad. My snacks are protein bars. I’m moving more. When I get to work, I park my car in the parking spaces furthest away from the entrance. During the day, I take a couple of minutes to relax and breathe, or I’ll go for a short walk. I find that moving is the best way to finish my day, too. I walk 10 thousand steps a day, and I’m running now. I like to run an average of four miles at a slow pace. I’m cycling again. I didn’t ride my bike much before the Challenge. Now, when the weather is nice, I go for a long ride. It’s a great way to lower stress. I also started doing box breathing and yoga, which helps me relax. Moving has made a big difference in how I feel. At work, I’m more productive. I arrive 10 minutes early to think about what I’m doing and focus on my goals. And when it comes to focusing, I do one thing at a time now instead of multitasking. That allows me to complete my tasks faster and I don’t leave anything half done or incomplete. And I’m connecting with my team. I always congratulate my co-workers for doing a great job. And I try to motivate them to continue doing their best, so they gain trust within themselves. Microsteps helped me to set up a nighttime routine. I have a set time now to go to sleep, I stopped watching T.V. late at night, and I don’t have my phone by my bed. So when I wake up in the morning I don’t start my day by looking at my phone. I get enough sleep and feel refreshed in the morning. Because we’re cooking at home, we’re not spending as much. I realized I’m saving at least $300 dollars a week, because every time I ate out it was not just me, but the whole family, and there are five of us. We’re also budgeting. I decided to analyze what I need and what can wait until later. We need another computer at home. But instead of buying one now, the short-term solution was to take turns using the computer, so everyone is still able to get their work done. I’m setting a good example for my kids. I have more energy for them now and I spend more time with them. I’ll help them with homework. I like practicing math with Joseph, my 10-year-old; we’ll do equations together. At his parent-teacher conference, Joseph’s teacher said he was great at math, so Joseph said that was because he had learned from the best: “My Daddy.” Listening to his response made me feel great and confident that I’m doing a good job as a dad. I have a lot more energy. Before, I was always falling asleep and didn’t feel like doing anything. Now, we’re connecting as a family, playing soccer, and going for bike rides instead of watching television or playing games. The Thrive Challenge has helped me make huge changes in my life. I’ve lost weight and I’ve lowered my sugar level and my blood pressure which is almost at a normal range. And what’s great is that it’s not just my life that’s changed. I’ve inspired my wife, my sister in-law, and father in-law to lose weight and improve their health. That means a lot to me. I’m excited to continue my journey. — Jose Lopez, Distribution Center #6094, Bentonville, AR; $5K Winner",

    "text": "Brevard College women's soccer student-athlete Kiara Porcelli has been named a 2024 Coaches Scholar All-South Region Second-Team performer by the United Soccer Coaches association. The award is presented to women’s soccer student-athletes throughout the nation who display excellence both on the field and in the classroom.

    "text": "Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has informed mediators, Qatar and Egypt, that his Palestinian militant group had accepted their Gaza truce proposal after nearly seven months of war.\nThe group in a statement published on its official website, said Haniyeh had spoken on the phone with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and with Egyptian Intelligence Minister Abbas Kamel, informing them of Hamas’s approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement.\nAccording to a senior Hamas official, this does not mean that the ceasefire has come into effect yet, pointing out that the Israeli side has not yet communicated its position.\nAnother senior official told AFP on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorised to speak publicly about the negotiations that: “The ball is now in the court of the Israeli occupation, whether it will agree to the ceasefire agreement or obstruct it.”\nThe Hamas announcement came after Israel on Monday called on Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah ahead of a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of such a move.\nAn AFP correspondent reported that in Rafah, where civilians had voiced fear and confusion over the evacuation order, crowds cheered and fired in the air in the streets following Hamas’s announcement.\nThe correspondent added that people were crying tears of happiness, chanting “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greatest) and shooting in the air in celebration of the news.\nDespite months of shuttle diplomacy, mediators have failed to broker a new truce like the week-long ceasefire that saw 105 hostages released last November, the Israelis among them in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel.\nPrevious negotiation efforts had stalled in part because of Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire and Netanyahu’s vows to crush its remaining fighters in Rafah.\nGaza’s bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\nIsrael estimates that 128 of the hostages abducted by militants on October 7 remain in Gaza, including 35 who the military says are dead.\nAccording to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry, vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed at least 34,735 people in Gaza, mostly women and children.",
