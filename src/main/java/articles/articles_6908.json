    "text": "As Samsung prepares to launch the next generation of its tablets later this year, leaks have already started to surface. We were previously treated to a render of the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, which revealed some tweaks to its design. Now, a new certification listing has shed more light on the tablet.\nThe Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra has been spotted in Finland’s SGS Fimko database. The listing shows three variants: SM-X936B, SM-X936N, and SM-X930. These are expected to be the 5G and WiFi version, the WiFi-only model, and the South Korean edition respectively.\nImage: XpertPick But more importantly, the listing shows the device’s battery capacity and charging speed. The Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra will reportedly pack an 11,600mAh battery, which is a slight upgrade compared to its precursor’s 11,200mAh capacity. However, the charging speed is kept at 45W, which may come as a disappointment for those expecting an upgrade.\nSource: Evan Blass via X Aside from the battery information, not much is known about the upcoming flagship tablet. It has been said that the device will be equipped with a MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ chipset. Moreover, it will apparently run on Android 16 via One UI 8. Of course, these are still rumours at this point, and we’ll only know if the information is accurate once the company officially releases the tablet.\n(Source: XpertPick via AndroidPolice )",

    "text": "Home policy Status: 22.08.2024, 22:53\nFrom: Paul Luka Schneider\nPress Split\nThe Kursk advance has heated up tempers in the Ukraine war. Russian President Vladimir Putin is now accusing Ukraine of attacking a nuclear power plant.\nMoscow/Kursk – Is a new escalation stage looming in the Ukraine War on? Russia’s President Vladimir Putin clearly thinks so. On Thursday (22 August) he accused Ukraine of attacking the nuclear power plant in the Russian border region after the Kursk attack. The nuclear power plant near the city of Kurchatov has four blocks and an output of almost two gigawatts. It is located around 60 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.\n“The enemy tried to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant today,” Putin told the Russian news agency Cup According to him, this was during a meeting in Moscow about the situation in the Russian border region. He did not provide any evidence for his claim.\nAfter Kursk advance, trenches are dug around nuclear power plants – reports of drone attacks Putin also said that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had been informed and was preparing a mission to Kursk. According to its own military, Ukraine has so far captured an area of ​​over 1,260 square kilometers and 93 towns in the Russian border region following its surprise offensive. The part of the armed forces that has advanced the furthest and can be verified is about 30 kilometers from the Kursk nuclear power plant.\nAccording to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the nuclear power plant in the Russian border region of Kursk has been the target of a Ukrainian attack. © Tatyana Simonenkova/Imago It is unclear whether the nuclear plant is even a target of the Ukrainian advance. However, the Kremlin has been somewhat afraid of it since the beginning of Ukraine’s Kursk advance on August 6th. And has taken security measures. According to reports, the Russian nuclear company Rosatom began withdrawing some of its employees from the plant last week. In addition, Russian soldiers dug trenches around the site of the power plant.\nAccording to Russian sources, air raid alarms have been triggered several times around the nuclear power plant in recent days and rocket parts have even been found on the power plant site. There have already been drone attacks, reported the Russian investigative magazine Important Stories A nuclear power plant employee told the KyivPost, that the workforce was advised to “take cover”.\nUkraine War: The Origins of the Conflict with Russia View photo gallery After the Kursk attack, Moscow repeatedly threatened a harsh response if the nuclear power plant was attacked, without giving any concrete details. Putin made no public statement on this on Thursday (22 August).\n“Very concerned” about situation after Kursk attack: Head of nuclear authority travels to nuclear power plant Meanwhile, a group of people around the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, will be visiting the Kursk nuclear power plant next week. This was confirmed by his spokesman for the German Press Agency The nuclear power plant is within range of Ukrainian artillery positions, said the IAEA Director General of the Financial Times He added: “Since there is fighting, I am very worried.”\nGrossi wants to clarify on site, among other things, whether the plant has already been targeted. After the Ukrainian advance began, the authority warned that the safety of nuclear power plants must not be endangered. The same applies to Kursk as to the Russian-occupied Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia.\nThe latter could possibly be the deciding factor as to why Ukraine might dare to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant. Pro-Russian military blogger Alexander Sladkov recently suggested that Ukraine could carry out a kind of ring swap with Russia if it occupied the Kursk nuclear power plant.
