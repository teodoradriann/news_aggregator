    "text": "Something goes bump in the night, and it just so happens to be you. Vampires: Bloodlord Rising positions you as the mysterious overlord in a castle, terrorizing the local region and gradually growing your army of ghouls. Now, with a rebrand, the project is starting to come together as we approach launch.\nFormerly known as Vampire Dynasty, Vampires: Bloodlord Rising is a building game , of sorts, but more ghoulish than most. Once you’ve settled down in Sangavia, it’s time to start expanding your plot of land, and then finding food. Under the cover of night, of course, since sunlight is the enemy.\nEssentially, the sandbox game lets you live out whatever fantasies you’ve had reading Dracula, thinking that his life sounded incredible. The loop involves gradually building up your domain, feasting on locals, and then repeating as your power grows. It’s all appropriately gothic and European – and cozy, if I do say so myself, even if it’s slightly terrifying.\nThe latest trailer demonstrates the architecture that’s possible with enough time and energy. Your very own Bran Castle can be massive, casting a shadow over everyone who lives nearby. Stealth skills provide the means to feed without detection, so long as you don’t get too brave or cocky. You can still be vanquished, don’t forget!\nIt’s the debut project from Mehuman Games, and it’s an ambitious way to make themselves known. There’s plenty of ground here for updates and improvements down the line should the playerbase show up. Given the relative scarcity of great vampire games , they just might.\nVampires: Bloodlord Rising comes out in Steam Early Access later this year. Until then, check out the best zombie games and best open-world games for some more scares and exploration.\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or join our community Discord to stay in the know.",

    "text": "[Long Island](/long-island) [Suffolk](/long-island/suffolk) Suffolk County Police on Thursday arrested an East Northport man on charges of trespassing and harassing members at a Melville mosque. Police said Jordan Endler entered the Islamic Center of Melville, at 118 East Old Neck Rd, on Wednesday at 2:36 p.m. and made statements regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. Endler was asked to leave by members of the mosque after refusing to remove his shoes and walking on carpets in prayer rooms, mosque president Talaat Abdelmoneim said on Thursday. Police were called and Endler left the location after officers arrived, police said. Endler, 46, was arrested at his Norton Drive home at 7:53 p.m. after an investigation by Hate Crimes Unit detectives, police said in a news release. He was charged with third-degree criminal trespass and second-degree harassment. He is being held at the Third Precinct and is scheduled to be arraigned at First District Court in Central Islip on Friday. On Friday, Abdelmoneim said he and his members are appreciative of law enforcement officials who listened to their concerns. “They showed their support and not tolerance to the disruptive or hostile behavior anywhere in any community which is our same position,” he said. “We feel much safer and part of the community.” Abdelmoneim said initially mosque members felt law enforcement officials were slow to respond to their concerns, but after meeting with them Thursday afternoon they felt better. “We had a very constructive meeting where we expressed our concerns about safety and such disruptive behavior and making people feel unsafe,” he said. “Our concern was about the safety and police said they will do whatever needs to be done.” Abdelmoneim said law enforcement officials said they would increase police presence around the mosque during Sunday school, Friday prayers and around Ramadan. Suffolk police did not immediately respond to questions about who attended the meeting with mosque members and what was discussed. Updated 23 minutes ago Arrest in mosque incident ...
