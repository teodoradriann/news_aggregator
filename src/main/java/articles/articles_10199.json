    "title": "Wat Lat Nam Khao fire: Novice monk heroically rescues abbot | Thaiger",
    "text": "A fire broke out at Wat Lat Nam Khao in Suphan Buri, with a novice monk smashing a window to rescue Luang Pu Thoop, a revered monk, from the flames. Despite the swift response from local firefighters, the fire consumed the temple’s ancient wooden structures. At 2pm yesterday, Narongsak Palakawong Na Ayudhya, an investigator at Bang Pla Ma Police Station in Suphan Buri, received a report about a fire at Wat Lat Nam Khao, located in Salee Subdistrict. He immediately dispatched rescue teams from various organisations, including Naen Kaew Highway Rescue, Sameukarn Foundation, and Ruamkatanyu Foundation, along with fire trucks from Kok Kram Municipality and nearby local administrative organisations. The local community also joined efforts to extinguish the rapidly spreading fire . Due to the temple’s predominantly wooden architecture, the fire raged intensely and took over four hours to bring under control. Upon investigation, it was revealed that the fire started with a loud electrical short-circuit sound near the monks’ quarters and the prayer hall. A novice monk at the scene heard the noise and saw the flames spreading quickly. He rushed to alert Luang Pu Thoop Yanawaro, the 87 year old abbot, who was resting at the time. Despite knocking on the door, there was no response. The novice then broke a window to rescue Luang Pu Thoop, who sustained minor injuries but was otherwise safe. The fire destroyed the monks’ quarters and the over-50-year-old wooden prayer hall. Valuable artefacts, including ancient Buddha statues and amulets, were also damaged. Initial damage estimates are around 5 million baht (US$136,000). The cause of the fire is suspected to be an electrical short circuit, but further investigation is needed to confirm this. Following the incident, the Facebook page ไม้มงคลพระเครื่อง posted a message and photos of Luang Pu Thoop. The post described the monk’s calm demeanour despite the recent calamity. “A monk who has never known suffering smiles even after a terrible event.” The accompanying image showed Luang Pu Thoop smiling while looking at his burned quarters, reported KhaoSod. “It burned down but we can rebuild it. Thank you for your concern.” This post resonated with many Buddhists, who shared and commented on it extensively, expressing their reverence and support for Luang Pu Thoop. Thailand News",

The biggest of which is probably COVID going to the background.”\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nDespite the decline, however, murder and most other crimes remain higher than they were before 2020.\nThe drop in murder rates and other violent crimes also varies by city. Detroit is on track to record the lowest number of murders since the 1960s, while Philadelphia and Los Angeles experienced particularly notable drops in homicides and shooting victims, respectively.

(NASDAQ: SOUN) securities between May 10, 2024 and March 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until May 27, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the SoundHound class action lawsuit. Captioned Liles v. SoundHound AI, Inc. , No. 25-cv-02915 (N.D. Cal.), the SoundHound class action lawsuit charges SoundHound as well as certain of SoundHound’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the SoundHound class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-soundhound-ai-inc-class-action-lawsuit.h ...\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

    "text": "WATERTOWN — The lake-effect snow storm Thursday caused some trouble for north country residents as snow continued to fall in the area through the afternoon and evening.\nDo you have a snowblower? You voted: Yes, it's essential! Nope, a shovel works for me We use a plow on a vehicle I don't handle the snow removal Vote View Results Back A state trooper had to be taken to Samaritan Medical Center for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries Thursday after a multi-vehicle crash forced a portion of Interstate 81 to be shut down.\nPolice said in a news release that the crash occurred in the southbound lane and involved two troop vehicles and a civilian vehicle.\nHigh winds led to blustery conditions across the area, with both Jefferson and Lewis counties issuing travel advisories. In Lewis County, a portion of Route 26 had to be closed in both directions Thursday between Bridge Street and Deer River Road after a tractor trailer struck a pole.\nWind also caused some trees to fall into roadways, emergency dispatchers reported. A wind gust of 53 mph was reported at Watertown International Airport near Dexter.\nThe National Weather Service in Buffalo states on its website that the band off of Lake Ontario was expected to stay near Watertown to Fort Drum through the mid-afternoon before shifting south to the northern part of Tug Hill late Thursday afternoon. Two-to-three inches of snow per hour was expected to fall.\nLater Thursday evening, it was anticipated that the band would then shift back north closer to Watertown and potentially to Watertown overnight.\n“The band will also intensify later (Thursday) evening and overnight, with 3-4” per hour snowfall rates possible,” the report states.\nLate Thursday night the band was anticipated to shift south crossing over the Tug Hill and ending up in northern or central Oswego County.\nThose not in the lake-effect area should expect mainly dry weather with some sunshine on Friday.\nThere is little chance of snow over the weekend with a high of 29 with sunny skies on Saturday, and a chance of showers after 1 p.m. Sunday.\nAs of around 4 p.m. Thursday, 8.5 inches of snow fell in Watertown, according to the National Weather Service with 9.8 inches falling in Black River.\nA lake-effect snow warning for Jefferson and Lewis counties expires at 7 p.m. Friday.\nJohnson Newspapers 7.1",

Epub 2023 Dec 3. PMID:\n38144358\nGuo Liu\nAlleviating inflammation and promoting dentine regeneration is critical for the healing of pulpitis. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory, angiogenesis and odontogenesis function of icariin on Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) under inflammatory state. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms was also evaluated. Icariin attenuated the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory marker expression, such as interleukin-1β(IL-1β), IL-6 and IL-8. The immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining results showed that icariin suppressed the inflammatory responses mediated by the protein kinase B (Akt) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling cascades. Additionally, icariin also upregulated the expression of odontogenic and angiogenic genes and proteins (namely dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), anti-collagenⅠ(COL-Ⅰ), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1)), alkaline phosphatase activity, and calcium nodule deposition in LPS-exposed HDPCs. In a word, our findings indicated that icariin attenuated pulp inflammation and promoted odontogenic and angiogenic differentiation in the inflammatory state. Icariin may be a promising vital pulp therapy agent for the regenerative treatment of the inflamed dental pulp.\n[Icariin : CK(10) : AC(7)](/substance/icariin) [Inflammation : CK(9572) : AC(3089)](/disease/inflammation), [Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Toxicity : CK(1764) : AC(1073)](/disease/lipopolysaccharide-induced-toxicity)",

    "text": "Die Bildungssenatorin hat frühere Aussagen im Abgeordnetenhaus korrigiert. Im Parlament erklärt sie, wie es dazu gekommen ist. Und sie geht noch einen Schritt weiter.\nHeute, 12:18 Uhr\nBildungssenatorin Katharina Günther‑Wünsch (CDU) hat sich im Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus für falsche Aussagen von ihr im Parlament entschuldigt. „In meiner öffentlichen Erklärung am vergangenen Freitag habe ich öffentlich gemacht, dass ich am Bildungsausschuss am 5. Juni und im Plenum am 12. Juni eine nicht den Tatsachen entsprechende Aussage zum Zeitpunkt eines Schreibens gemacht habe, wann es mir vorgelegen hat“, sagte sie. „Ich möchte heute die Gelegenheit hier und jetzt nutzen und auch ergreifen, um mich sowohl bei der Öffentlichkeit als auch bei Ihnen, sehr geehrte Fraktionäre für diese falsche Erinnerung meinerseits zu entschuldigen.“\nDabei ging es um die Frage, wann sie einen an sie gerichteten Anwaltsbrief im Auftrag des Berliner Lehrers Oziel Inácio-Stech bekommen hat, der an seiner Schule nach eigenen Angaben wegen seiner Homosexualität gemobbt wurde.\nGünther-Wünsch hatte zunächst gesagt, den Brief erst in diesem Mai gelesen zu haben. Am Freitag räumte sie ein, dass ihr das Schreiben vom 4. Dezember 2024 persönlich vorgelegen habe.\nPostbuch verzeichnete das Schreiben nicht „Die von mir gemachten Angaben beruhten auf dem damaligen Stand der internen Prüfung“, sagte die CDU-Politikerin zur Erklärung. „Wir haben ein elektronisches Postbuch - wie wahrscheinlich alle Fachverwaltungen - und diesem elektronischen Postbuch war weder zu entnehmen, dass dieses Schreiben vorlag, noch dass ich es verfügt hätte.“\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\nAn dieser Stelle finden Sie einen von unseren Redakteuren ausgewählten, externen Inhalt, der den Artikel für Sie mit zusätzlichen Informationen anreichert.

Dezember vorgelegen habe. „Und da mir angesichts der Komplexität des Sachverhalts eine Transparenz äußerst wichtig ist, habe ich am selben Tag, an dem mir diese Information zugekommen ist, die Öffentlichkeit informiert“, sagte Günther-Wünsch.\nAkteneinsicht soll Transparenz schaffen Zu der Möglichkeit für Abgeordnete, am Montag Einsicht in die Akten zu nehmen, sagte die Bildungssenatorin, es sei ihr Ziel, höchstmögliche Transparenz herzustellen. „Denn sie ist die Voraussetzung dafür, die notwendigen, aber auch die richtigen Ableitungen aus dem ganzen Sachverhalt zu ziehen.“\nDafür sei es notwendig, Kenntnis des gesamten Sachverhaltes zu haben. Aus ihrer Sicht sei der Sachverhalt nach wie vor sehr komplex. „Und deswegen erhoffe ich mir aus der Aktenansicht zum einen diese Transparenz für alle, zweitens einen tiefgehenden Austausch auch hier im Plenum und drittens eine fundierte Grundlage, die wir alle benötigen zur Bewertung und dann zu treffenden Ableitungen.“\nDie Grünen haben beantragt, am Nachmittag über einen Missbilligungsantrag gegen die Bildungssenatorin wegen der falschen Angaben abstimmen zu lassen.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250626-930-720364/1\nDas ist eine Nachricht direkt aus dem dpa-Newskanal.\nZur Startseite\nshowPaywall: false isSubscriber: false isPaid:\nper E-Mail teilen\nauf Facebook teilen\nauf Twitter teilen\nper WhatsApp teilen\nauf Pocket teilen\nper E-Mail teilen Ausblenden",

Lisa Johnson, The Canadian Press Aug 15, 2024 4:30 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Alberta Premier Daniel Smith speaks at a news conference in Calgary, Alta., Tuesday, July 30, 2024. Smith says her government will introduce legislation on new school pronoun rules after classes begin in September. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Todd Korol EDMONTON — Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says her government will introduce legislation on pronouns in schools after classes begin in September.\nSmith said the new policy requiring parents to consent before children under 16 can change their names or pronouns in schools will be proposed in the fall legislature session that begins in late October.\n\"I don't want to presuppose what the outcome of those deliberations would be, but there will be lots of time to be able to get the policies in place and to implement them, so we have to make sure we have that robust discussion,\" Smith told an unrelated news conference on Thursday.\nHer comments come about three weeks before most kindergarten to Grade 12 schools open their classrooms.\nSmith said she intends to bring legislation forward for a suite of policies she first announced in January.\nThose include restricting transgender youth access to gender-affirming health care, banning transgender participation in female sports, and requiring parental consent or notification on sex education and changes to pronouns and names in schools.\n\"Once you've passed legislation, regulations have to be implemented,\" said Smith, who did not offer specifics about what enforcement would look like.\nLGBTQ+ advocacy groups Egale Canada and Skipping Stone Foundation have said if Alberta moves ahead with the proposed changes, they would bring legal action.\nBefore Smith spoke on Thursday, the province’s two largest school divisions -- the Edmonton Public School Board and the Calgary Board of Education -- said they weren’t clear on what the province will implement and when those changes would arrive.\nOn Wednesday, Alberta Teachers’ Association president Jason Schilling told The Canadian Press that his colleagues are incredibly worried about a chilling effect of new pronoun rules, even if the policy remains in limbo.\n\"It does definitely have a bit of a dark cloud hanging over things,\" he said, noting many teachers worry about being put in the position of having to decide whether to violate the trust and confidence of a student.\n\"They don't want to jeopardize the safety of a student who might trust them enough to share the struggles that they're going through,\" said Schilling.\nThe issue has raised questions over whether Smith’s government would ultimately follow in the footsteps of Saskatchewan's government.\nSaskatchewan invoked the rarely used notwithstanding clause to override sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Saskatchewan's Human Rights Code for its pronoun legislation last fall.\nSchilling said if the Alberta premier did that, it would be \"a sledgehammer approach,\" and tone deaf.\nMore pressing worries for teachers are a lack of educational assistants, and ballooning class sizes, he said.\nCritics have called Smith's moves an act of appeasement to her far-right United Conservative Party base ahead of a leadership review in early November, but Smith has said the issue of \"parental rights\" is important to her government.\nShe has said she believes there’s nothing wrong with parents wanting to protect their \"child’s innocence as long as possible on issues of sexuality.\"\nFollowing Smith's announcement Thursday, Kristopher Wells, a Canada Research Chair for the public understanding of sexual and gender minority youth at MacEwan University in Edmonton, wrote on social media that the premier's \"obsession\" with the transgender community is \"beyond weird.\"\n\"The fact that she ignores our crumbling health-care system to obsess over what parts people have in their pants is deeply disturbing. This trans panic she is manufacturing is hateful, hurtful and needs to stop,\" Wells wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nSaskatchewan passed a law in October preventing children under 16 from changing their names or pronouns at school without parental consent. Dozens of teachers signed an online petition calling on school divisions not to follow the law. The Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission has said invoking the notwithstanding clause significantly affects the rights of minors.\nHeather Kuttai, a former Saskatchewan human rights commissioner, resigned over the legislation, saying it assaults the rights of gender-diverse children.\nA report from Saskatchewan's child advocate said it violates rights to gender identity and expression.\n— With files from Jeremy Simes in Regina\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.\nLisa Johnson, The Canadian Press\nSee a typo/mistake?
