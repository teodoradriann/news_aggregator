    "text": "Sébastien Loeb va à nouveau goûter aux joies du rallye, sa discipline de prédilection. Sans possibilité de rouler en WRC depuis que M-Sport lui a préféré Ott Tänak l'an dernier et qu'il a signé un contrat avec Dacia pour un programme en rallye-raid qui débutera le mois prochain au Maroc, le nonuple champion du monde va retrouver les spéciales du Championnat de France asphalte.\nL'ÉQUIPE Trois ans après sa dernière participation à l'épreuve, à bord de sa Peugeot 306 Maxi personnelle et avec son fidèle acolyte à ses côtés Daniel Elena (6e place), Loeb va à nouveau emprunter les routes du Mont-Blanc Morzine, sixième manche du Championnat national. Il partagera cette fois l'habitacle d'une Alpine A100 GT + (marque du groupe Renault, comme son employeur Dacia) avec sa compagne Laurène Godey.\nLoeb trouvera face à lui les habituels animateurs du Championnat de France, dont le recordman de victoires (7) au Mont-Blanc, Yoann Bonato, de retour à la compétition avec sa Citroën C3 Rally2 après son gros accident sur le Rallye Vosges Grand Est et qui aura à coeur de refaire son retard sur le leader du Championnat Eric Camilli (Hyundai i20 Rally2) et sur Léo Rossel (Citroën C3 Rally2).\nLoeb, vainqueur de l'épreuve en 2001 au volant d'une Citroën Xsara, aura aussi un bon élément de comparaison avec la présence de Raphaël Astier, qui connaît bien cette Alpine A110 GT + avec laquelle il s'est illustré au Rouergue.

    "text": "Indian cricketer Shreyas Iyer has invested an undisclosed amount of capital in healthtech platform Curelo. His investment was part of an INR 10 Cr funding round raised by the startup. It also saw participation from IIMA Ventures (IIM Ahmedabad's startup incubator), US-based family offices, and Zee5 cofounder Tarun Katial.\nThe fresh proceeds will be utilised to expand Curelo’s footprint, standardise unorganised labs, and shore up growth.\nFounded in 2022 by Arpit Jayswal, Curelo is a healthtech platform that aggregates diagnostic labs across the country and offers one-stop solution for home sample collection for lab tests.\nIyer, commenting on his investment, said, \"I'm pleased to be a part of Curelo's journey… They have an innovative and customer-friendly approach to diagnostics and healthcare, and I am excited to contribute to its growth.”\nMeanwhile, Curelo founder and CEO Jayswal said, \"We are delighted to welcome Shreyas Iyer as an investor in Curelo. His belief in our platform adds immense value as we continue to redefine the diagnostic market. This collaboration positions us as a trusted brand with accelerated growth and reinforces our commitment to serving the evolving needs of our users.\"\nPrior to the latest funding round, the Delhi NCR-based startup raised $100K from IIMA Ventures in October last year.\nCurelo claims to have seen its revenue by more than 25X in the past one year and has set its eyes on acquiring 300% more patients by 2025.\nWith the investment, Iyer has become the latest Indian cricketer to invest in startups. While Hardik Pandya backed kids' footwear brand Arreto and D2C food startup Yu last year, Mahendra Singh Dhoni invested in creatortech startup Rigi and fitness startup Tagda Raho in 2023.\nShikhar Dhawan also pumped an undisclosed amount of capital in D2C snack brand TagZ Foods last year. Just days ago, cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle invested an undisclosed amount of capital in online cricket gaming startup Hitwicket\nThe fundraise comes at a time when the ongoing funding winter has dried up the capital for the healthtech sector. The funding raised by Indian healthtech startups tanked 83% to $233 Mn in 2023 from $1.4 Bn in 2022.\nDespite this, funds continue to trickle into the space. In January, CureBay bagged INR 62 Cr in its Series A1 funding round led by Elevar Equity. In February, healthtech startup Aarogya Tech also raised $1.8 Mn in a seed round led by Hersha Group owner Hasu P Shah.\nThe post Cricketer Shreyas Iyer Invests In Healthtech Startup Curelo appeared first on Inc42 Media.",

    "title": "New Humanoid Robot Stuns Internet with Its Smooth Walking Ability",
    "text": "Chinese robotics startup Engine AI recently launched a new humanoid robot that stunned everyone with its natural human-like gait which many attributed to CGI.\nMajor robotic companies around the world have been trying to replicate the smooth human gait in their humanoid robots for decades, with relatively modest results, but last October, Chinese company Engine AI unveiled the SE01, its most advanced humanoid robot yet. Featuring an advanced end-to-end neural network system, the SE01 robot learns to walk like a human in a simulation, getting feedback for how well it does and constantly improving over time. It is powered by dual processors from Nvidia and Intel and features three stereo cameras that help it navigate and interact with complex environments.\n“Advanced optical motion-capture technology and an end-to-end neural network allow the robot to accurately replicate human motion, making it highly adaptable to diverse environments,” Engine AI said about its revolutionary robot.\nMade of lightweight aerospace-grade aluminum and featuring a slick humanoid design, the SE01 robot blew everyone’s mind when it was unveiled last year to the point where many were wondering if it was real or computer-generated. Dr. Jim Fan, who leads Nvidia’s GR00T project, posted a video of SE01 walking in Shenzen, near Engine AI’s headquarters, asking people to confirm that it was a real robot and not AI-generated .\nAllegedly shot in Shenzhen. Is this real? Can someone verify? I’ve seen this company posting very natural humanoid walking gaits a couple months ago. These days, it’s hard to tell CGI vs Sora vs real … pic.twitter.com/j2D7CEALvq\n— Jim Fan (@DrJimFan) January 8, 2025\n“Is this real? Can someone verify? I’ve seen this company posting very natural humanoid walking gaits a couple of months ago. These days, it’s hard to tell CGI vs Sora vs real,” Fan wrote on X, before following up with another clip and confirming that the SE01 was the real deal.\n“I’ve verified from reliable sources. New visual Turing Test: this is a real robot demo! The controller is a neural net trained in Isaac simulator using reinforcement learning and then sim2real,” Fan wrote.\nThe video was posted on their official-looking LinkedIn page. They have a booth at CES; I’m wondering if they’ve brought a functioning robot there.\nThe robot looks legit based on the early prototype testing clips in this video. pic.twitter.com/OkaIDsM3MS\n— The Humanoid Hub (@TheHumanoidHub) January 8, 2025\nIn November of last year, Engine AI told Chinese news outlet National Business Daily that it was trying to keep the production costs of its SE01 humanoid robot under 100,000 yuan ($13,700) and hoped to sell the advanced model for prices between 150,000 ($20,600) and 200,000 yuan ($27,400).",

    "text": "A spike in electricity demand from the world’s big data providers is raising a worrying possibility for the world’s climate: a near-term surge in fossil-fuel use.\nUtilities, power regulators and researchers in a half-dozen countries told Reuters the surprising growth in power demand driven by the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing is being met in the near-term by fossil fuels like natural gas, and even coal, because the pace of clean-energy deployments is moving too slowly to keep up.\nIn the United States, home to a third of world data centers, utilities are adding new gas plants and delaying the retirements of fossil-fuel power plants as a slew of sprawling new data centers plug in to the grid. In Poland, Germany and Malaysia, coal could also be in the mix, according to interviews with company executives, regulators and analysts.\nThe outlook poses a new obstacle to world governments, now gathered at the UN’s annual climate conference in Baku , which are already struggling to meet ambitious targets to decarbonize power systems.\nSubscribe to the Compass newsletter. Fast Company's trending stories delivered to you daily Privacy Policy |\nFast Company Newsletters COP29 host Azerbaijan held the first-ever Digitalization Day at a world climate summit and launched a declaration, endorsed so far by 68 countries including China and Korea, to limit the environmental impact of digitalization.\nThe outlook also reveals the shortcomings of data-company pledges to be green. Companies including Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Amazon.com are committing to sourcing renewable energy and zeroing out emissions with clean power and offset credits – but often that only means siphoning clean power out of the grid that could have been used somewhere else.\nMeanwhile, agreements by data providers to power new data centers with advanced nuclear reactors or resurrected nuclear plants are uncertain and years off.\n“I think everyone agrees that we need more and more renewable energy to keep up with a growing demand,” said Meta spokesman Jim Cullinan. “I think it is up to the utilities to comment on how they will fill the supply.”\nAmazon told Reuters that investing in new renewable energy for the grid, including in regions relying heavily on fossil fuels, is part of its strategy to decarbonize.\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley projects the global data-center industry will produce around 2.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent through the end of the decade, the equivalent of Russia’s annual emissions.\nPumping the gas Northern Virginia in the U.S. has the biggest concentration of data centers in the world. Utility Dominion, which serves the area, has an answer: gas.\nThe utility is building a 1,000-megawatt gas plant in Chesterfield County and recently slashed its 15-year projection for renewables to 80% from 95% of its power mix.\n“Overall, power demand in our service territory is growing at an unprecedented pace,” said spokesman Aaron Ruby.\nSeveral other U.S. utilities said they are keeping on fossil-fired power plants longer and building new facilities as data-center demand grows, according to a Reuters review of recent company earnings calls.\nEntergy, for example, began building its first natural gas-fired power plant in a half-century, the company said. The 754-MW power station will serve two Amazon data-center complexes being built in Mississippi.\nNearly half of utility NiSource’s new $19.3 billion capital expenditure plan through 2029, meanwhile, will be spent on natural gas system improvements, the company said. NiSource covers some of the most quickly developing data center markets in parts of Indiana, Ohio and Virginia.\nRob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, said natural gas is a clear answer for data centers.\n“It’s just the lowest cost, most reliable and it is decarbonizing in terms of it replacing coal,” he said. “Is it perfect solution? No. But I don’t know if we have a perfect solution to power these data centers.”\nS&P said data centers could add between 3 billion and 6 billion cubic feet per day to U.S. natural gas demand by the end of the decade.\nadvertisement That will worsen the U.S. performance on emissions, possibly for decades, clean-energy consultancy RMI said.\n“Data centers are just a warm-up act compared to the amount of electrification we’re going to have going forward. And if our first instinct is to start building gas plants and nuclear plants in order to do that, we’re just going to create an energy system we cannot afford,” RMI CEO Jon Creyts said.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said he intends to boost the U.S. power system when he takes office, and sources close to his transition team have said his plans are likely to prioritize gas development over renewables.\nCoal in the mix? Research firm McKinsey said in a report last month most of the increase in data-center power consumption in the European Union by 2030 will be supplied low-carbon sources.\nMcKinsey declined to elaborate when asked whether low-carbon sources included natural gas, and whether the trend could prolong the life of coal.\nIn some parts of Europe, data centers will need coal.\nIn Poland, for example, a rush of new datacenter projects will need to run at least partially off baseload sources like coal because of the still-low volume of renewables in the country, according to Szymon Kowalski, deputy head of Re-Source Poland, a platform for corporate renewable energy sourcing.\nThe share of coal in Poland’s energy mix has been falling for years as it ramps up renewables, but still stood above 60% in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.\nIn Ireland, meanwhile, data centers now account for over 20% of electricity consumption, according to the IEA.\nSystem operator EirGrid told Reuters it will meet demand with 650 MW of temporary emergency generation capacity, and by delaying the retirement of older generators. It said natural gas would be an important part of the mix.\nIreland’s only coal station, ESB Group’s 915 MW Moneypoint plant, extended its retirement date last year to 2029 from 2025, but intends to burn fuel oil instead of coal during that period.\nIn Germany, Microsoft this year announced plans to expand data-center capacity with a 3.2 billion euro ($3.38 billion) investment, near the 400-meter-deep Hambach coal mine.\nMicrosoft declined to say whether the project would rely on coal. “We are still in an early stage of the project, that’s why we do not comment,” spokesperson Jo Klein said.\nIn Malaysia, some data companies are taking power from the coal and gas-dominated grid instead of paying a premium for renewables, according to a government official familiar with the matter. Less than 50% of the green power Malaysia has sought to auction this year has been purchased, the official said.\n($1 = 0.9467 euro)\n—Valerie Volcovici and Laila Kearney, Reuters\nThe application deadline for Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas Awards is Friday, December 6, at 11:59 p.m. PT.

    "title": "Dogecoin Rises 17% After Musk Tweet: Should You Buy DOGE?",
    "text": "[Dogecoin](https://watcher.guru/news/category/altcoins/dogecoin) is the highest-gaining cryptocurrency out of the top 40, and Elon Musk is to thank for the recent surge. Musk tweeted on Tuesday that “D.O.G.E will fix it” in response to a Los Angeles Times article about California officials preventing Musk’s SpaceX from conducting more rocket launches. The D.O.G.E he was referring to is an idea posed by Donald Trump about a government efficiency commission – the Department Of Government Efficiency. Trump has said that if he was elected he would make Musk the head of this division. DOGE responded extremely well to this tweet by Musk. Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin has jumped 6.8%. It’s also up 17% this week, currently priced at $0.1236. Given Musk’s influence over the Dogecoin valuation in 2021, Trump winning the election could create a massive tailwind for the world’s largest meme coin to continue growing. Elon Musk, Bitcoin Drive Dogecoin Upward The asset has long been consolidating, showing signs of stagnancy when it comes to its price valuation. However, this recent climb has holders and investors alike bullish. Per Santiment, the recent BTC spike also favored Doge, contributing to the dog-themed currency’s recent success. The much-needed boost for DOGE has helped stabilize its price pedestal, giving it a chance to explore higher price levels by leveraging the current market momentum. According to [CoinCodex](https://coincodex.com/crypto/dogecoin/price-prediction/) analysis, Doge may note a notable decline in its price level by the end of this month. It may trade at $ 0.107862 by October end. [Also Read: How Much Dogecoin Does DOGE Founder Billy Markus Own?](https://watcher.guru/news/how-much-dogecoin-does-doge-founder-billy-markus-own) Amid the recent Doge downturns, leading crypto analyst Ali Martinez also shared how, despite the low Doge momentum, Dogecoin active addresses have managed to peak at 133,880, signaling strong user support. The active addresses are at their highest since the start of 2024, which reveals that the activity around the token is at a year-to-date high leading up to the November election. Dogecoin, along with other assets in the market, is expected to witness a spike, going by history and current trends. Prepping the community for the same, Martinez pointed out that Dogecoin indicated a buy signal.",
