    "text": "Carteles de ‘sólo sí es sí’ en un prostíbulo de El Ejido con mujeres explotadas y rituales esotéricos\nVigiladas las 24 horas, estaban sometidas a un estricto control y los clientes podían usarlas como \"esclavas sexuales\"\nLa Policía ha detenido a la pareja que regentaba la casa-burdel\nUn\nchamán, mujeres obligadas a ejercer la prostitución, rituales esotéricos y carteles del sólo sí es sí en las puertas. Es el escenario que se encontró la Policía Nacional en un prostíbulo de El Ejido (Almería) regentado por una pareja, detenida por presuntos delitos de explotación sexual y contra los derechos de los ciudadanos extranjeros.\nLos arrestados forzaban a mujeres en situación de «especial vulnerabilidad» a ejercer la prostitución en condiciones «infrahumanas» y bajo un estricto régimen de reglas y control exhaustivo.\nEl hombre, de nacionalidad cubana, era el presunto encargado de captar a las trabajadoras. Buscaba inmigrantes que residieran en España de manera irregular y se hacía pasar por una especie de chamán, «amenazándolas con rituales esotéricos que les provocarían el mal» tanto a ellas como a sus familiares.\nSu mujer era la encargada de gestionar la «rutina» del prostíbulo y sometía a las víctimas a un férreo «control», dando a las trabajadoras instrucciones precisas sobre lo que tenían que decir a la Policía Nacional en caso de una inspección. Además, y según recoge la investigación, colocó en las puertas de la casa-burdel carteles de sensibilización institucional con el eslogan sólo sí es sí, en alusión a la ley impulsada por el Ministerio de Igualdad de\nIrene Montero.\nLas mujeres denunciaron que la detenida las controlaba las 24 horas del día a través de un circuito cerrado de televisión y utilizaba el audio del sistema para darles instrucciones, incluso cuando ésta se hallaba fuera del local. Las 13 chicas que llegaron a ejercer la prostitución en la casa se turnaban para dormir en un par de sofás, ya que las habitaciones se reservaban para dar servicio a los clientes.\nPresiones, multas y drogas\nSegún explicaron las víctimas, recibían presiones constantes a través de un sistema de multas para «no parar de realizar sus servicios sexuales»: debían estar disponibles todos los días del año, a cualquier hora del día o de la noche, y no podían decidir por ellas mismas si aceptaban o no a los clientes. Tampoco podían rechazar ninguna de las prácticas sexuales que estos les proponían, incluyendo el sexo sin medidas de protección, y si el cliente les ofrecía sustancias estupefacientes, debían aceptar «para complacerles».\nAsimismo, las trabajadoras relataron a los investigadores que en caso de negarse o superar el tiempo fijado para el servicio, «perdían su recaudación» y podían ser «expulsadas de la casa», empujadas a «subsistir sin ningún recurso».\nEn los registros, la Policía Nacional hizo acopio de cuadernos de cuentas donde quedaba acreditado que la detenida se quedaba con cantidades que oscilaban entre «el 40 y el 50% de los servicios». Además, restaba del dinero final los gastos en higiene, alimentos, consumiciones o preservativos, «llegando incluso a extender préstamos con intereses que rozaban la usura».\nUna de las víctimas declaró que aguantaba esta situación «con tal de no volver a su país», donde era perseguida por razón de su orientación sexual, mientras que otras estaban «tan desesperadas que se planteaban aceptar ofertas de sus clientes», quienes les proporcionaban alojamiento «a cambio de convertirse en sus esclavas sexuales».\nDetenidas 2 personas en\n[#ElEjido]( [#Almería]) acusadas de cometer [#delitos]relativos a la prostitución y delitos contra los derechos de los ciudadanos extranjeros\n👉🏻Uno de los arrestados se hacía pasar por\n[#chamán]para captar víctimas y las coaccionaba con rituales esotéricos [pic.twitter.com/fx6kOQMAlB]\n— Policía Nacional (@policia)\n[February 22, 2024]\nLa operación Zodiaco concluyó con la detención de los dos responsables del burdel por presuntos delitos de explotación sexual y contra los derechos de los ciudadanos extranjeros, además del cese de la actividad del prostíbulo, mientras que las mujeres liberadas fueron derivadas a los distintos servicios de protección institucional.",

    "title": "'Loveliest village in Britain' with sandy beaches and crystal clear water - Nottinghamshire Live",
    "text": "Tucked away on the coastline of Cornwall, just three miles west of Penzance, is the picturesque village and fishing port called Mousehole, a dreamy Cornish haven for anyone seeking quaint charm. With cobbled streets decked with traditional stone cottages, Mousehole's labyrinth of art galleries, unique boutiques and eateries all lead to an opportunity to perch by the water's edge, observing the calming rhythm of the tide. This once thriving pilchard port - known as \"Mowzel,\" not \"mouse hole\" - also boasts pebbled and sandy beaches within the harbour, its waters glistening clear. A year-round dog ban ensures its popularity among families with young ones who often engage in crabbing along the crystal-clear shorelines while adults soak up the serene view. As per the Daily Mail, it's \"like being in a postcard\". [Get the latest What's On news straight to your phone by joining us on WhatsApp](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/latest-whats-nottingham-news-updates-9002777) This tranquil village, which traces its roots back to the 1300s, served as a significant harbour and the major port for Mount's Bay. History will tell you that it was no stranger to conflict during the Spanish invasions of the 16th century when soldiers descended upon the coastal area amid historical tensions between the two nations. Visitors flock to Mousehole, drawn by the charm of its traditional life. Here they can sip on local craft beers, explore independent art galleries or enjoy a brisk swim in the natural tidal pool, reports [the Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/cutest-fishing-village-like-being-33174958). Echoing the sentiments of famed Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, many assert it's the \"loveliest village in Britain\", spellbound by picturesque harbour views and the offered artisan foods at places like Mousehole Deli and Kitchen or Tremayne Tea Room. Nestled at the focal point of the village is The Ship Inn, where diners are presented with seafood fare such as scampi and chips or rump steak, topped off with tempting sticky toffee pudding. Commended with a TripAdvisor Travellers Award, The Ship Inn boasts four out of five stars for its harbourside location and mouthwatering, generous meals. Promoting an effervescent and cosmopolitan ambiance, 2 Fore Street offers diners relaxed bistro-style dining,facing Mount's Bay. Visitors tend to opt for their hand-picked crab salad or grilled lemon sole fillets accompanied by samphire, enhanced by a glass of crisp prosecco. This establishment certainly makes the list of must-visit eateries for anyone visiting Mousehole. The village is adorned with [Christmas](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas) lights out of season, as part of an annual tradition that coincides with Tom Bawcocks Eve on December 23rd, when the famous Star Gazy Pie is prepared. The lights are respectfully switched off on December 19th in memory of the local lifeboat men who tragically lost their lives in the 1981 Penlee disaster. Despite the traditional cottages standing proudly by the sea for many years, the accommodation available in the village is far from old-fashioned or outdated. Beach Retreats offers a range of properties throughout Mousehole and beyond, boasting interiors worthy of a magazine feature set against idyllic backdrops. Whether you're looking to escape the daily grind and relax on Harbour Beach, or explore hidden gems within the winding streets, there's no denying that Mousehole is one of the most charming villages in the West Country, deserving of a visit at any time of year.",

    "text": "La Procuraduría General de la Nación le hizo la petición a la Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz, JEP, para que deje en libertad al general (r) [Mauricio Santoyo](https://www.bluradio.com/nacion/paz/dura-advertencia-de-la-jep-exgeneral-mauricio-santoyo-lo-expulsara-cb20), porque según el Ministerio Público cumplió con los cinco años mínimo privado de la libertad que ordena la ley en el caso de los integrantes de la Fuerza Pública. La JEP abordó el caso de Santoyo para determinar si cumple los requisitos necesarios para recibir beneficios de libertad transitoria, condicionada y anticipada, sin embargo, la JEP ha señalado que Santoyo no ha aportado suficiente verdad sobre su participación en los hechos por los cuales se le investiga, lo que ha complicado su situación legal en el país. “El problema jurídico que abordó la resolución apelada se redujo a determinar si el compareciente reúne los requisitos para otorgarle el beneficio de LTCA. Con tal propósito, expuso los requisitos legales que deben acreditarse para gozar el citado beneficio. Indicó que otorgar la LTCA constituye una “medida de confianza, sin que ello implique definir la situación jurídica del compareciente”, señala el documento emitido por la Procuraduría. En este documento, también se afirma que durante una audiencia de aporte de verdad realizada el 21 de marzo de 2024, Santoyo mantuvo su postura de negar cualquier responsabilidad en los delitos investigados, afirmando que no recuerda los hechos o que no participó en ellos, actitud criticada por la [JEP,](https://www.bluradio.com/nacion/paz/jep-cita-a-exgobernadores-de-narino-para-declarar-por-fumigacion-de-cultivos-ilicitos-cb20) que considera necesario que el compareciente contribuya de manera significativa a la construcción de la verdad y la memoria histórica del conflicto armado en Colombia.",

Gracias a los avances de la medicina, pudo cumplir su sueño: ser madre. “Era muy raro ver a una mujer joven con Párkinson”, reconoce Marta. Ella ahora tiene 43, pero los síntomas comenzaron hace 11 años. “Había síntomas que yo no los asociaba como dormir poco, estar muy cansada y las pérdidas de memoria”, añade en el Día Mundial de esta enfermedad.

La noticia le llegó con tan solo 32 años, un año después de aparecer los síntomas. “Cuando cogía los cubiertos se movían mucho y decía ‘Qué raro’, porque la mano ya era así, luego ya fue con el pie”, apunta. Los temblores, los espasmos y la rigidez se convirtieron en parte de su rutina durante todo un año entero. Pero decidió esconderlo porque le daba vergüenza. “Era como algo que yo no quería reconocer”, destaca. Después, dejó de poder hacer gestos cotidianos. “Lo que es batir un huevo, dar la vuelta a la tortilla, peinarme y hacer la cama es imposible”, recalca. Marta quiso cumplir su sueño pese a su enfermedad A pesar de tener que adaptarse a su nueva vida, Marta no dudó en perseguir su sueño de querer ser madre. “Fue bastante duro”, subraya antes de explicar el recorrido tan complicado que tuvo que realizar para conseguir este reto. “Salió un niño sanísimo, precioso y es lo mejor que me ha pasado”, dice. Marta necesitó bastante tiempo para darse cuenta de que ocultar la enfermedad no era la solución. “Ha sido muy difícil llegar hasta el momento en el que estoy ahora”, apunta.

    "title": "Ni anchos ni pitillo: estos son los (poco favorecedores) pantalones que marcarán tu vuelta a la oficina | Vogue España",
    "text": "Para las que vivimos en clave oversize, el retorno de los [pantalones anchos](https://www.vogue.es/moda/articulos/pantalones-ancho-cargo-sustituto-vaqueros-tendencia-primavera-verano-2022) a nuestro armario fue como una especie de milagro divino para desterrar aquellas fórmulas que nos hacían sentir embutidas día sí y día también. Sin embargo, con los caprichos de la moda, las [tendencias de otoño-invierno 2024-2025](https://www.vogue.es/articulos/tendencias-otono-invierno-2024-2025-que-se-lleva) han vuelto a poner en el foco a un archienemigo estilístico que no destaca precisamente por su comodidad. Ni baggy ni [pitillo,](https://www.vogue.es/articulos/pantalones-pitillo-tendencias-primavera-verano-2024) el pantalón cigarette viene a ser ese modelo complicado que promete vestir nuestro regreso a la oficina. ¿Qué es exactamente un pantalón cigarette? Esta silueta se define por un patrón recto, ligeramente más entallado en los bajos, que se acomodan justo a la altura del tobillo o un poco por encima de él. También pueden ser vaqueros, pero la tónica que encontramos entre las colecciones otoñales se declina en clave sastrería. Khaite, [Carolina Herrera](https://www.vogue.es/moda/modapedia/disenadores/carolina-herrera/8) y Jason Wu optan por versiones en negro combinadas con chaquetas cortas o tops y faldas por encima, un poco en línea con la microtendencia de los ‘ [skousers](https://www.vogue.es/articulos/falda-sobre-pantalon-tendencia-otono-invierno-2024-2025)’ que tanto vimos en la semana de la moda de Copenhague. [Ralph Lauren](https://www.vogue.es/moda/modapedia/marcas/ralph-lauren/152) prefiere darle un giro al traje de chaqueta de toda la vida con este tipo de pantalones más entallados combinados con botines de cordones. [Hermès](https://www.vogue.es/moda/modapedia/marcas/hermes/140) propone sacarlo de la paleta cromática más oscura y conjugarlo en clave total look. Así propone estilismos para vestir de rojo de pies a cabeza en los que los pantalones cigarette (más bien de tiro alto) se combinan con tops y chaquetas a tono. La coletilla de ‘poco favorecedores’ se debe precisamente a que su silueta entallada realza solamente un tipo muy específico de silueta, como sucede con los pantalones pitillo. Al ir más pegados, dificulta un poco más la libertad de movimientos frente, por ejemplo, a la comodidad que pueden presentar unos pantalones anchos de sastre. En cualquier caso, el secreto para combinarlos es concebirlos como cualquier otro pantalón de nuestro armario: una camiseta blanca y una cazadora vaquera pueden ser dos buenos aliados, como deja claro aquí la prescriptora Anne Laure Mais. Eso sí, parecen funcionar mejor con zapatos clásicos, como unos salones, unos botines de tacón o unos mules.
