    "title": "The Enduring Importance of Veritatis Splendor",
    "text": "Before 2023 becomes a memory, I want to salute a significant 30th anniversary. Thirty years ago Pope Saint John Paul II published an encyclical on morality called Veritatis Splendor (The Splendor of Truth). This was the first time a pope had set out the formal principles of the Church’s moral reasoning, and it remains a landmark. What follow in light of this fundamental fact are a few thoughts partly inspired by comments by Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, the prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. Speaking to the Catholic news site The Pillar, Cardinal Fernandez praised Veritatis Splendor as “a great document, powerfully solid.” But then he said its “particular concern—to set certain limits” by upholding exceptionless moral norms–limit its usefulness for theological “development.” A new document may be needed that “allows for encouraging the growth of Catholic theology,” he said. With all due respect to Cardinal Fernandez, it is hard to think of anything better suited to that noble purpose than Veritatis Splendor. Recalling its first chapter shows why. Pope John Paul reflects there on Jesus’ words (in chapter 19 of Matthew’s gospel) to the rich young man who asks what he should do to be saved. Jesus directs him to the commandments bearing on love of neighbor. But the young man persists: What else? Then Jesus tells him to sell his possessions, give the money to the poor, and follow him. Hearing that, the rich man goes away sad “for he had great possessions.” Reflecting on this, Saint John Paul says the message is that, beyond the moral minimalism of merely avoiding (most of the time) major violations of a moral code, a really serious person needs to make a “wholehearted commitment to the pursuit of holiness” as the foundation and starting point of Christian life. He quotes St. Augustine, who says that while avoiding serious sins is necessary, it is only the start for someone who wants to follow Christ. Beyond that, John Paul continues, lies a life shaped according to the Sermon on the Mount: “Jesus shows that the commandments must not be understood as a minimum limit not to be gone beyond, but rather as a path involving a moral and spiritual journey towards perfection, at the heart of which is love” (Veritatis Splendor, 15). Moreover, this journey is not exclusively for a spiritual elite, the Pope insists, but is meant instead to be the path for every Christian: “The way and at the same time the content of this perfection consist in the following of Jesus….Following Christ is thus the essential and primordial foundation of Christian morality” (Veritatis Splendor, 19). Re-reading these words after 30 years, one thinks of Chesterton’s comment that the Christian ideal “has not been tried and found wanting” but “found difficult and left untried.” In Veritatis Splendor Pope Saint John Paul II moves far beyond the tendency, too often visible in moral teaching of the past, to frame morality in legalistic terms and, as it were, set it apart from Christian life. Rather, he teaches, to do good and avoid evil is an integral part of the one, unified process called Christian life understood as the following of Christ. As Cardinal Fernandez says, Veritatis Splendor really is “powerfully solid.” It is also creative, innovative, and inspiring. In fact, it is hard to see that there is any real need for some supplement that “allows for encouraging the growth” of Catholic theology. Why go searching for what we already have?

    "text": "The release marks 80 years since the code-cracking machines that helped the Allies beat the Nazis in World War II. The public was in the dark about computers for decades, and the UK only admitted they existed in the 2000s.\nColossus was not just one computer, but a bunch of computers made by British boffins between 1943 and 1945. These huge metal monsters were key to breaking the Lorenz code, a secret message system used by Hitler and his cronies in Europe.\nThe computers let the Allies read Hitler's mind, or at the very least, his communications.\nThe early digital machine would begin deciphering vital strategic messages between senior Nazi generals in occupied Europe during the depths of World War II, when such information was more important than ever. The efforts of Colossus even helped confirm that Adolf Hitler erroneously believed the Allies would launch the D-Day invasion from Pas De Calais. Knowing their scheme to misdirect the Nazis was successful had enabled the Allies to go forth with a bold, dangerous plan to take back Europe by storming the beaches of Normandy. At the same time, the bulk of German defences waited for them at Pas De Calais instead.\nThe technology behind Colossus was amazing for its time. Tommy Flowers, the genius who built it, used more than 2,500 tubes to make logic gates. While 1945's ENIAC was considered the first computer, the discovery of Colossus changed that.\nGCHQ's sharing of old documents includes some snaps of the computer at different times and a letter about Flowers' brilliant work that mentions the catching of \"scary German orders\".\nAfter the war, the UK government told them to destroy most Colossus machines, and Flowers had to give up all his papers. GCHQ says the Colossus tech \"was so good. We still used it until the early 1960s\".\nIn the GCHQ press release, Director Anne Keast-Butler praised Colossus' role in the UK's history of innovation: \"The creativity, ingenuity and dedication shown by Tommy Flowers and his team to save the country were as important to GCHQ then as today.\"",

    "title": "On This Day in 2006: The tragic death of Gerald Levert",
    "text": "November 10, 2006 – Gerald Levert’s death shocks the music world He was too young, too talented, too everything. Gerald Levert’s sudden, unexpected death pained the soul music world deeply, and still does. He passed in his sleep on November 10, of a fatal combination of prescription pain medications and over-the-counter drugs, along with pnuemonia. He was only 40 years old. Levert had an auspicious childhood as the son of R&B legend Eddie Levert, the lead singer of the O’Jays, and the choice gene pool seemed to kick in at an early age. It ultimately led to him becoming one of the most popular R&B singers in the world as well as a prodigious songwriter. Sadly, at the peak of his career in 2006, Levert’s memorable life was cut short by a fatal heart attack. While still a teenager, Levert joined with brother Sean and friend Marc Gordon to form the soul group LeVert and, after one independent release, signed with Atlantic Records in 1985. Gerald’s voice was a near dead-ringer for his father’s distinctive, growling baritone, and his engaging lead took the group to the top of the Soul charts with “Pop Goes My Mind” and followed the next year with the top five Pop and Soul Atlantic single, “Casanova,” an infectious midtempo tune written for the group by Midnight Star’s Calloway brothers that elevated LeVert to the top of the late 80s Soul music pyramid. Gerald was developing as a songwriter and vocalist, and fronted LeVert through a string of top Soul hits over the next few years, including #1s “My Forever Love,” “Just Coolin'” and “Baby I’m Ready.” However, his development also moved him into a first-among-equals status that invariably led to a solo singing career. He branched out in 1991 with his solo debut, Private Line, and topped the Soul charts with the title track. Even better was his duet with his father Eddie on “Baby Hold On To Me,” a phenomenal ballad that was one of 1992’s most memorable songs and which led to their 1994 album of duets, Father and Son. Over the remainder of the decade Gerald continued to score big on the Soul charts, while only infrequently crossing over (most notably on the bland David Foster ballad “I’d Give Anything”). However, as the turn of the century hit, Gerald’s audience grew older and less tuned into hit radio, and he developed into more of an album artist. He remained incredibly prolific through the next half decade, releasing a new album annually and landing in the Soul and Pop 10 with each disc. He also provided quality songs and/or vocal help to a slew of other performers, including Patti LaBelle and Yolanda Adams, and was part of a popular but artistically disappointing 2-album stint with singers Johnny Gill and Keith Sweat in the macho, sexed-up group LSG. In 2005, Gerald Levert compiled a number of his strongest duets with other artists as well as songs with LSG and a few new recordings on the CD Voices. For LeVert fans, Voices served as a nice compilation of some of LeVert’s notable work outside of his solo albums, including great cuts with the Rude Boys (“Written All Over Your Face”), LSG (“My Side of the Bed”) and Kelly Price (“All I Want Is You”). And for the uninitiated, it was a fine introduction to Gerald Levert as a songwriter and vocalist. While Gerald Levert’s catalog is of varying quality, he certainly demonstrated himself as a capable songwriter and a consistently strong vocalist. Most impressive was the longevity he experienced during a particularly fickled period in popular music — he remained at the top of his game for two decades. Time has passed but we haven’t remotely forgotten the death of this talented man (and, less than two years later, his brother Sean). Tonight we’ll raise a glass and put some magical G on “repeat.” By Chris Rizik",

    "title": "El 93% de las personas de la comunidad musulmana dice haber sufrido discriminación, según informe de Asociación Marroquí",
    "text": "MÁLAGA, 29 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa Asociación Marroquí para la Integración de los Inmigrantes ha llevado a cabo la investigación '¿Por qué no se denuncia la islamofobia en España?', elaborada a nivel nacional, de la que se extrae, entre otras conclusiones, que el 93% de las personas que pertenecen a la comunidad musulmana afirman haber sido víctimas de actitudes discriminatorias por motivos islamófobos, racistas y/o xenófobos.\nEsto supone, según han puesto de manifiesto desde la Asociación Marroquí a través de un comunicado, que \"solo siete de cada 100 personas pertenecientes a dicho colectivo sienten que no han sufrido discriminación por dichos motivos en España\".\nSe trata, han señalado, de un estudio \"pionero\" a nivel nacional cuyo objetivo es contabilizar, tanto cuantitativamente como cualitativamente, la situación de la discriminación por motivos islamófobos en el país.\nEn este estudio han participado 650 personas musulmanas o percibidas como tal de todas las comunidades y ciudades autónomas de España, 38 administraciones públicas y entidades sociales y 19 grupos focales, donde participaron personas que ya se percibían como víctimas de discursos de odio motivado por este asunto.\nLa investigación se ha elaborado en el marco del Programa Estatal de lucha contra la Infradenuncia en la discriminación islamófoba, financiado por el Ministerio de Derechos Sociales, Consumo y Agenda 2030 con cargo a la asignación tributaria del Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas y del Impuesto sobre Sociedades.\nSegún han afirmado desde la asociación, las conclusiones arrojan \"la necesidad de seguir facilitando herramientas para contestar a la islamofobia, ya que el alto porcentaje de personas que sufren discriminación se complementa con que sólo un 6,4% de las víctimas denuncia\".\n\"Es decir, el 93,6% de los casos de odio no se ponen en conocimiento de las autoridades competentes\", han incidido. En cuanto a las causas de la infradenuncia, en el informe se apunta que los motivos más comunes son \"que no sabían que podían denunciarlo, la falta de confianza en las instituciones y el temor a ser discriminado/a o no ser atendidos/as adecuadamente debido a su cultura y/o religión\".\nPor otro lado, en cuanto a la forma en la que se manifiestan estas agresiones, la investigación destaca que ocho de cada diez víctimas de islamofobia \"sufren comentarios, insultos y gestos ofensivos y/o alguna forma de ofensa e intolerancia por uso del hiyab, siendo estas una de las formas de discriminación de las más predominantes\".\nAsimismo, una de cada cuatro agresiones que sufre una mujer musulmana en España se produce como consecuencia del uso del hiyab, han indicado desde la Asociación Marroquí. Los lugares o contextos en donde más discriminación islamófoba se manifiesta son la calle o lugar público, el sitio de trabajo y el colegio o centro educativo.\nA través de esta investigación, han asegurado que también se ha podido cuantificar \"la necesidad de aumentar los recursos que protejan a las víctimas, ya que la discriminación por islamofobia no es un hecho aislado\". Al respecto, han apuntado que las víctimas \"suelen ser reiteradamente agredidas\".\nDe hecho, han indicado que \"nueve de cada diez personas que fueron encuestadas declararon haber sufrido algún tipo de discriminación y/o conducta de odio en más de una ocasión\". Asimismo, una de cada cuatro víctimas necesitó apoyo psicológico y emocional, recibiéndola solamente un 26% de las mismas, señala el estudio. El resto declaró en su mayoría no haberla recibido por falta de medios.\nDesde la Asociación Marroquí han concluido que \"se confirma que la discriminación por islamofobia, al igual que otras formas de odio, suele ser sutil y estar normalizada\". \"Esto explica el alto porcentaje de personas afectadas y el elevado índice de infradenuncia\", han manifestado.\nPor esto han insistido en la importancia de \"seguir visibilizando estos datos, de aumentar la sensibilización ciudadana y de trabajar desde la transversalidad para disminuir esta lacra\". Asimismo, han reiterado que \"es muy importante dar a conocer repetidamente que detrás de estas agresiones y comentarios se encuentran personas a las que se les está atacando su integridad moral y en ocasiones física\".\n\"Desde la entidad, consideramos que sigue existiendo un vacío estadístico en este campo, por lo que es necesario seguir trabajando la islamofobia también desde el campo de la investigación y el mundo académico\", han señalado en el comunicado, recordando que como asociación que lleva cinco años elaborando el Programa Nacional para la Prevención de la Islamofobia han recogido algunas recomendaciones \"para frenar el odio, que son útiles tanto para administraciones como para la sociedad en general\".\nMás información Inmigración Racismo",
