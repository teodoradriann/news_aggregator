    "text": "Hutchinson fundraiser to honor Haven native killed in Vietnam War May 9 After working with the Kansas legislature to name a portion of K-96 after their Vietnam War hero relative, a Haven family is holding a fundraiser to help pay for the signage. PFC Henry Lee Fisher is one of 17 Reno County soldiers killed in action during the Vietnam War. The lifelong Haven resident who joined the Army and became part of the 16th Infantry - 1st Infantry Division. He was eventually sent to the frontlines of Vietnam and died on June 18, 1967, at the age of 20. This winter, Fisher’s family helped pass House Bill 2481 to dedicate the portion of K-96 from the east to west borders of Haven. The Kansas House and Senate both passed this bill with unanimous support and Gov. Laura Kelly signed it into law April 18. The stretch of highway will be known as the PFC Henry Lee Fisher Memorial Highway, Fisher's nephew Jake Feil said in an email. While the Kansas Department of Transportation is responsible for maintenance of the highway, the Fisher family must fund the signage. They have raised $12,000, which is just half the funding needed to complete the project. With the help of Vieyra Honors Foundation, a fundraising event has been set for May 9 from 7-10 p.m. at the Baker Ballroom, 17 E 2nd St. in Hutchinson. Proceeds will go to help fund signage for the PFC Henry Lee Fisher Memorial Highway. \"This event will not only honor PFC Henry Lee Fisher but all Reno County soldiers who were killed in action during the Vietnam War to ensure that their ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms must never be forgotten,\" Feil said. The event will feature a live performance by Hutchinson’s very own country music singer/songwriter Morgan Wilk, a full taco bar and a silent auction. Tickets are just $35 and can be purchased online at [vieyrahonorsfoundation.org/events](http://vieyrahonorsfoundation.org/events) or by phone at 620-960-8215.",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Chile mantiene un primer diálogo «directo y constructivo» con EEUU sobre aranceles\nSantiago de Chile, 16 abr (EFE).- La subsecretaria de Relaciones Económicas Internacionales de Chile, Claudia Sanhueza, dijo este miércoles que tuvo un primer «diálogo directo y constructivo» con el jefe de la Oficina del Representante Comercial de EE. UU., Jamieson Greer, tras la imposición de un arancel del 10 % a la mayoría de los productos chilenos.\n«Se cumplió el objetivo. Tuvimos una buena primera reunión donde logramos establecer un diálogo directo y constructivo con el representante de Comercio de Estados Unidos, quien destacó la importancia estratégica de Chile dentro de la región para EE.UU.», indicó Sanhueza en un comunicado.\nLa diplomática chilena agregó en la nota que acordaron reunirse dos veces más durante el primer semestre del año con el objetivo de «facilitar el fortalecimiento de la relación económica-comercial bilateral en beneficio de ambos países, de acuerdo con lo establecido en nuestro Acuerdo de Libre Comercio vigente desde 2004».\nEl presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, anunció el pasado 2 de abril un arancel global del 10 % a la gran mayoría de sus socios comerciales, incluido Chile.\nEl Gobierno del presiente progresista Gabriel Boric busca que Chile se libre del arancel del 10 %, como hicieron México y Canadá, ya que el país sudamericano tiene un TLC con Estados Unidos desde hace más de dos décadas y la balanza comercial es favorable al gigante norteamericano.\nEn 2024, el intercambio comercial entre ambos países alcanzó los 31.636 millones de dólares, según datos de la Subsecretaría de Relaciones Económicas Internacionales.\nEl cobre, la principal exportación chilena, está excluido de momento del arancel porque Trump ordenó en febrero una investigación para determinar si la alta dependencia de las importaciones de cobre representa un riesgo para la seguridad nacional y, en caso afirmativo, tomar medidas para restringirlas.\nChile, el mayor productor de cobre del mundo, exportó en 2024 a Estados Unidos cerca de 5.800 millones de dólares de cobre, que ingresaron al mercado norteamericano con un arancel del 0 % en virtud del TLC.\nEl canciller de Chile, Alberto van Klaveren, dijo este miércoles en un encuentro con corresponsales extranjeros en Santiago que «confía» en que el Gobierno de Trump «respete» el TLC.\nDurante su viaje esta semana a Washington, Sanhueza se reunió también con el CEO de la International Copper Association, Juan Ignacio Díaz, y con representantes de la Cámara de Comercio de Estados Unidos (US Chamber of Commerce).
