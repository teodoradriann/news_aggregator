    "title": "No Christmas in Bethlehem, Breakthrough in Vatican, and Himalayan Declaration",
    "text": "by Rajan Philips\nIn Bethlehem where it all began, there is no Christmas this year. Bethlehem is located in Israeli occupied West Bank of Palestine. Palestinian churches have reportedly cancelled Christmas celebrations and some of them have set up nativity scenes showing the symbolic Baby Jesus lying in a manger of rubble destruction. Death and destruction now define life in Gaza less than 100 km to the west, but Palestinians on the West Bank are also subject to unchecked attacks by illegal Jewish settlers and retaliation by the Israeli army against Palestinian protests.\nIt is all Christmas in the US but in a climate of national political confusion in spite of a robustly performing economy. The confusion about the war in Israel, not to mention the one in Ukraine; the hysteria over antisemitism, with the US Congress declaring opposition to Zionism as antisemitism; the for and against moves centered on Donald Trump; and competing expectations and forebodings for the great election year of 2024.\nThere will be little Christmas time in Washington for the Biden Administration, which is literally on the horns of its own dilemma of simultaneously supporting and restraining the Israeli government’s devastation of Gaza.\nAt the last UN General Assembly vote on October 12 when 153 countries called for a ‘humanitarian ceasefire,’ 20 countries abstained, and the US voted against the resolution along with Israel and eight other minions. But the US encouraged its allies (e.g., Australia, Canada and New Zealand, three of the Five Eyes along with the US and the UK) to take up a united position and support the resolution.\nAt the time of writing (Thursday evening, New York / Friday morning, Colombo), the US is finally trying to give support to a UN Security Council resolution calling for “suspension of hostilities” and “scaled-up humanitarian aid access to Gaza.” Unlike the General Assembly resolutions, Security Council resolutions have legal teeth.\nThe Security Council vote has been delayed several times at the US’s asking to find acceptable wording to support it and not veto it. If the resolution passes, that would be the first in the current crisis. With Hamas insisting that there will be no more release of hostages until Israel completely stops its attacks on Gaza, the US and its Middle East allies are looking for alternative avenues to bring about a ceasefire, howsoever it might be called.\nAs Canadian academic and international relations expert Janice Stein observed after the UN General Assembly vote, the US has “significant influence over what comes next … Starting in 1956 the United States has frequently forced Israel both to stop the fighting, accept the ceasefire and at times to pull back.” So, this will not be the first time that the US might use its influence to bring about a ceasefire.\nHow soon the US will be able to do it this time is the question. Otherwise, there is no immediate end in sight to this conflict even well into the New Year. With Yemen’s Houthis emboldened to attack merchandise ships in the Red Sea, the whole conflict may take a different turn. The other conflict in Ukraine has entered a stalemate favourable to Russia, with fatigue setting in among Ukraine’s sponsors about continuing their material support of the war.\nBreakthrough in Vatican\nLost in the din of war is what otherwise would have been an excellent Christmas gift and news. Last Monday, a week before Christmas, Pope Francis, the Jesuit Pope, issued a landmark authorization for priests to administer blessings on same-sex couples but outside the Church’s regular mass or formal rituals. This is a reversal of the Church’s 2021 declaration disallowing such blessings in keeping with the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The change is considered as providing a “simple blessing” and not the sacrament of (heterosexual) marriage. Yet, it is a huge step for the Vatican.\nThe change will have its supporters and decriers, and more so in the US than anywhere else. American Jesuit Father James Martin who works among LGBT communities, has welcomed the change as “a major step forward in the church’s ministry” to them. Many same sex-couples are delighted. The conservatives in the Church are obviously opposed to it. Ulrich L. Lehner, a US theology professor, reflecting his nation’s penchant for culture wars, has called it “an invitation to schism”.\nThe Vatican breakthrough comes two months after the conclusion of the historic synod that Pope Francis had convened to guide the future of the Catholic Church. For the first time in its history the Church convened an official gathering of 364 members that included non-clerical members of the Church including 54 women. The Pope called for the meeting in 2021 as part of his efforts to reform the church and to bring the superstructure of the Church into alignment with the base of its faithful followers. Preparations over two years included consultations among Catholics around the world. Women’s role in the Church emerged as a central question with almost universal call for opening up opportunities for women to take on decision-making roles in the Church.\nAfter nearly a month of deliberations the Synod issued a Synthesis Report of 41 pages with each paragraph voted separately and receiving over two-thirds majority. The synod process and experience were based on listening and formulating positions rather than receiving top down resolutions. The report covered all the current challenges facing the Church including clerical sexual abuse, women’s roles in the church, outreach to poor and the concept of “synodality” itself.\nThe report noted that throughout the synod process, “many women expressed deep gratitude for the work of priests and bishops. They also spoke of a Church that wounds. Clericalism, a chauvinist mentality and inappropriate expressions of authority continue to scar the face of the Church and damage its communion.” “A profound spiritual conversion is needed as the foundation for any effective structural change,” it said. “Sexual abuse and the abuse of power and authority continue to cry out for justice, healing and reconciliation.” The same issues will be in focus again when the synod reconvenes in October 2024.\nA Himalayan Declaration\nSri Lanka has its problems, a continuation of the economic crisis that began last year, and unprecedented in its own historical parallels. Yet it is fortunate enough to be where it is unlike many of the other world’s troubled spots. And all of a sudden the country received a shot in the arm, so to speak, aimed at addressing its most chronic problem involving the political relationship among its communities. The shot came literally entitled as the Himalayan Declaration, and it became public after it was formally presented by its authors to President Wickremesinghe. More presentations to other notables are reported to be in the offing. But what difference the declaration is going to make is too early to tell.\nThe grand sounding name Himalayan Declaration is apparently derived from the small town of Nagarkot in Nepal, where the signatories to the declaration gathered and reached their six-point agreement as the basis for yet another initiative to resolve Sri Lanka’s national question. After the experiences of Thimphu, Oslo, and numerous other gatherings and consultations in many parts of the world including many cities in India, one can only wish heavenly blessings for the latest initiative coming down from the Himalayas to finally succeed. Most of us can only wish and watch, but the success of the initiative will ultimately depend on who among Sri Lanka’s current political actors will take over the initiative and cross the finish line.\nThe signatories to the new initiative portray an interesting coalescence comprising all Buddhist Priests from among the Sinhalese, and all Tamil expatriates living in western countries seemingly acting on behalf of the Tamils.\nOne would think the involvement of the Buddhist Priests, all of whom appear to be at the higher echelons of the Sangha hierarchy is intended to maximize the declaration’s purchase among the Sinhalese. Conversely, if their presence in the declaration can dampen the usual rabble rousing against such initiatives, that in itself would be a significant contribution.\nThe expatriate Tamil signatories to the declaration and others who worked on it are not household political names in Sri Lanka or among the Sri Lankan diasporas. But they have been in the business of ethnic politics for all their adult lives, and their intervention at this stage deserves due commendation. Unlike the interlopers who used to pop up during the Rajapaksa and Sirisena years, the present group is obviously not looking for handouts from the government. But that is not going to save them from brickbats that will be flung at them from their far flung compatriots, which seem to have already started.\nThere is never going to be unanimity among the Tamils on any proposal(s) for reconciliation. That is not in their collective DNA. But if there is substantial support among the Sinhalese for a significant initiative that is also championed by the government in power, then the collective Tamil response will be equally positive. Otherwise, even if the Tamils are unanimous in their support for an initiative it will not go anywhere without sufficient purchase among the Sinhalese. One shortcoming of the initiative is the absence of Muslim and Indian Tamil participants and signatories. Obviously, it could not have been an intended omission, but in ethnic relationships inadvertent omissions can be as damaging as deliberate ones.",

    "text": "Organizaciones de pacientes, vecinales y ecologistas denuncian preocupantes niveles de contaminación electromagnética (CEM) en Hospital Universitario La Paz de Madrid, instando a las autoridades a aplicar el Principio de Precaución y a considerar alternativas más seguras como la conexión por cable\nSFC-SQM Madrid, junto a la Federación Regional de Asociaciones Vecinales de Madrid (FRAVM), Ecologistas en Acción y otras asociaciones dedicadas a la salud, han dado a conocer un informe en el que se advierte sobre los elevados niveles de radiación electromagnética presentes en el Hospital Universitario La Paz de Madrid. El documento, respaldado por mediciones in situ, subraya que los niveles de radiofrecuencias registradas en el centro superan ampliamente los límites precautorios recomendados por organismos internacionales, y lo que estos niveles representan para la salud de los empleados y usuarios del hospital, inquietudes que se ven agravadas por la instalación masiva de redes inalámbricas como el WiFi y la tecnología 5G. Según el informe, esta situación dificulta seriamente la atención a personas electrohipersensibles, siendo que el hospital podría no ofrecer un entorno seguro para estos pacientes.\nLas mediciones realizadas en el hospital revelaron densidades de potencia alarmantemente altas, llegando en algunos puntos a picos de 441.000 μW/m². Valores especialmente críticos se detectaron en la planta primera del hospital, donde se registraron intensidades de campo eléctrico de hasta 41 V/m. Estas cifras indican, superan con creces, los límites recomendados por la Resolución 1815 del Consejo de Europa , que aboga por una aplicación estricta del principio de precaución en estos entornos.\nAnte esta problemática, los colectivos firmantes han elevado una reclamación a las secciones sindicales del hospital, solicitando una serie de acciones concretas. Entre ellas, destacan la implementación de comunicaciones por cable, a través de conexiones Ethernet, como una alternativa más segura a las actuales redes inalámbricas. También exigen la reducción de las zonas con conectividad inalámbrica y la definición de espacios libres de contaminación electromagnética para atender correctamente a los pacientes afectados por el síndrome de hipersensibilidad electromagnética.\nAdemás, en sintonía con el artículo 4.1 del Real Decreto 299/2016, piden la eliminación o reducción al mínimo posible de los riesgos asociados a la exposición a campos electromagnéticos y la retirada de estaciones de telefonía móvil situadas en el propio hospital hasta que exista una normativa nacional más estricta en la materia.\nEste hecho no está aislado. Un estudio previo realizado en el Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón mostró resultados similares, lo que sugiere un patrón preocupante dentro de las instituciones sanitarias de la región. No obstante, hasta la fecha, las autoridades del Hospital Universitario La Paz no han emitido respuesta oficial respecto al informe y las mediciones presentadas.\nLas organizaciones han anunciado futuras reuniones con las autoridades con el objetivo de abordar estas preocupaciones. En este contexto, Marta Orbe, vicepresidenta de SFC-SQM Madrid expresó su confianza en que el hospital responda favorablemente, teniendo en cuenta la adaptación previa positiva del centro para pacientes con Sensibilidad Química Múltiple, y aguardan acciones claras en cuanto a la aplicación del principio de precaución en materia de contaminación electromagnética para proteger a las personas electrosensibles.",

The excitement swiftly waned as Kohli walked back to the pavilion, leaving fans to wonder about the former captain's vulnerability on his off-stump—a weakness exposed during the recent Australia tour.\nDespite an enthusiastic start, Kohli's attempts to dominate the bowler led to his downfall, as a seaming ball shattered his off-stump.

    "text": "Turkish seas witness most bountiful fishing season in years TRABZON Turkish waters have experienced an unprecedented bounty in the first half of the fishing season , marking a three-decade high, with the northern coasts proving exceptionally rich in fish diversity, according to fishermen.\nTürkiye imposes a seasonal fishing ban annually from April 15 to Sept. 1 to protect fish spawning, promote marine ecosystem health and ensure the sustainability of the fishing industry.\nWhen the ban lifts, thousands of fishermen take to the seas, contributing to an industry that remains a vital pillar of the national economy\n\"The Black Sea has been remarkably fruitful this year, both in terms of abundance and diversity. We haven't seen a bonito catch like this in perhaps 30 years. Even mullet, which typically appears later, showed up early this year, \" fisherman Hüseyin Yılmaz said.\nAnother veteran of the trade added, “I’ve been in this sector for years. While we’ve had larger hauls before, the consistency and variety this season are truly remarkable.”\nThe season began with an exceptional harvest of bonito, followed by a prolific yield of anchovies and horse mackerel. Whiting and mullet later contributed to the bountiful season, keeping the momentum strong for fishermen.\nLooking ahead to the second half of the fishing season, which continues until April 15, fishermen remain optimistic. They particularly emphasize the Black Sea’s superiority in yield compared to Türkiye’s other maritime regions this year.\nAquaculture exports from the Eastern Black Sea region surged by 23 percent in the first 11 months of the year, generating more than $200 million, marking a significant increase on the same period last year. Russia emerged as the leading importer of Turkish seafood.\nTrabzon, a pivotal hub for seafood exports, accounted for $130 million of the region’s earnings, underscoring its dominance in the industry.\nWith production exceeding 500,000 tons in 2023, Türkiye ranks among Europe’s leading nations in aquaculture. The country now aims to surpass $2 billion in seafood export revenues by the end of 2024.\nMeanwhile, in southern waters, the government’s efforts to curb the invasive pufferfish population — a species notorious for its toxic venom and destructive impact on fishing equipment — have gained momentum.\nA program launched in 2020 compensates fishermen for capturing eight specific pufferfish species, offering payments for each fish delivered to authorities.\nA report released on Dec. 26 revealed that between 2020 and 2024, 88,747 pufferfish were caught, preventing the introduction of over 6.6 million new individuals into the ecosystem.\nIn Türkiye’s landlocked regions, winter fishing traditions endure as well. On the frozen expanses of Çıldır Lake, located 1,959 meters above sea level, fishermen employ Eskimo-style techniques to harvest a variety of fish, braving icy conditions to continue their trade.",

    "text": "PA State Rep Scared Free Tampons At Schools Will Turn Kids Communist\nOne in four menstruating students in the US has missed class due to not being able to afford pads or tampons.\nThanks to inflation and the climate-change-induced increase in the cost of cotton, period poverty — the inability to afford menstrual products — has become a public health crisis in the United States, affecting two out of every five menstruating people.\nOne in four menstruating students have said they have missed class or other school activities as a direct result of not being able to afford pads or tampons. In response to this, 27 states have started making them free at schools, so that students don’t have to worry about needing to run home in their gym clothes with a sweater tied around their waist — and Pennsylvania is (we hope) about to become the 28th.\nBy a\nvote of 117 to 85 this week, the Pennsylvania House voted in favor of a bill to establish a grant program to help schools buy pads and tampons for students who cannot otherwise afford them. Isn’t that nice?\nLoving this post? Not a free or paid subscriber yet? Let’s fix that!\nWell, we certainly think so, but Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton) has other ideas. In response to the bill passing, Rep. Borowicz openly and publicly fretted that the program was just the first step in the march to communism.\n“Just another step by the governor and Democrats to have government provide everything for you, which leads to communism. A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take everything away,” Borowicz said, overlooking the somewhat crucial fact that students rarely pay for these things (or anything else) out of their own pockets.\nYes, it sure is bad when the government provides people with things — you know, like they do with the entire public school system.\nLet me just logic this out though. Under communism, everyone has tampons, and that’s bad — so it’s better for some students to not have tampons than for them to live under the evil communist tampon regime, because if the government gives the students tampons, the government can take them away and then no one will have any tampons and will be forced to just free bleed all over everything in their wake. I don’t know, it seems kind of unlikely.\nOr is she suggesting that this will give students a taste for communism and they will start to believe in crazy things like single payer health care?\nBy that same token, Rep. Borowicz assumes that students who can’t afford to buy tampons or pads will grow up to love the capitalism that led to them not having any tampons or pads and having to miss class because of this. That also seems pretty unlikely. In fact, she might want to consider that this may make those students even more likely to embrace the evil communist tampon regime.\nI always wonder what people like Rep. Borowicz think would happen if we got rid of all the social programs and didn’t provide anyone with anything and instead just let them suffer. Because I think it might look a little like the French Revolution. Or the Russian Revolution. Or pretty much any other revolution that started because people were super sick and tired of being very, very poor while others were very, very rich.\nIronically, the full “Is Your Washroom Breeding Bolsheviks?” poster that I used in the image above actually suggests that “harsh, cheap paper towels” in the washroom is what might cause one’s employees to turn to communism. The text below it reads “Employees lose respect for a company that fails to provide decent facilities for their comfort.\" The moral of the story is actually meant to be that spending a little extra in order to make people comfortable is what will keep them from revolting against capitalism.\nLuckily, Borowicz is in the minority here — although the bill now moves to the GOP-controlled state Senate, where we can assume there are a whole lot more of her. Hopefully, they can put aside their hatred of “free stuff” and choose to do what’s best for Pennsylvania students.\nGov. Josh Shapiro, whose proposed budget for 2024-25 includes $3 million to provide menstrual products to schools, praised the vote as a “big step forward,” in general, not towards communism, and indicated that he would sign it as soon as it hits his desk.\nPREVIOUSLY:\n·",

    "text": "Retirement boost for savers with plans to scoop up smaller pension pots\nThe Government said some 13 million small pots hold £1,000 or less.\nVicky Shaw\nPeople could get a retirement savings boost from a pension consolidator to scoop up smaller pots that may otherwise become lost.\nThere are now 13 million of these small pots, holding £1,000 or less, with the number increasing by around one million a year, the Government said.\nUnder reforms introduced as part of the Pension Schemes Bill, each individual saver’s small pots will be brought together into one pension scheme. People will still have the right to opt out.\nThe Government said the move will also reduce admin costs for businesses.\nPensions minister Torsten Bell said: “There are now more small pension pots in the UK than pensioners – raising costs and hassle for workers trying to track their savings. It also costs the pensions industry hundreds of millions of pounds every year.\n“We will automatically bring together people’s small pots into one high performing pension, reducing costs as well as hassle for savers. In time this could boost the pension of an average earner by around £1,000.”\nZoe Alexander, director of policy and advocacy at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA), said: “The accumulation of small pots creates unnecessary cost and complexity for savers and schemes alike. The PLSA has worked extensively with industry and the DWP (Department for Work and Pensions) to propose solutions and supports the model being proposed by the Government.”\nRocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: “Which? called for the consolidation of small pots under £1,000 before the election, so we are delighted that the Government is committing to doing this.”\nGail Izat, workplace managing director at Standard Life, part of Phoenix Group, said: “The introduction of consolidators that can administer these pots effectively and invest them dynamically will be a step forward.”",

    "text": "In an Indian town known as a flashpoint for sectarian violence, workers are crafting the final touches on a divisive temple that has come to symbolise the country’s rising tide of Hindu nationalism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will next month inaugurate Ayodhya’s new shrine to Lord Ram on a site where a mosque once stood, before it was torn down by Hindu zealots more than three decades ago. Muslim residents of the city, remembering the deadly riots that accompanied the demolition, have been wary of its renewed atmosphere of religious fervour. But for many more, the project is both a means of restoring Ayodhya to the glory of its depiction in ancient Hindu texts, and proof of Modi’s commitment to defending India’s majority faith just months ahead of national elections. “Modi has stayed true to his promise,” housewife Gudiya Devi told AFP outside another temple in Ayodhya after her morning prayers. “All these years we dreamt of a majestic Ram temple and now that dream is coming true,” she added. “This is all thanks to Modi. He is our true leader.” Artisans were toiling on top of bamboo scaffolds Friday to finish ornamental details on the main structure of the imposing shrine, which will stand 50 metres (160 feet) tall at its highest point. With a price tag of an estimated 20 billion rupees ($240 million) according to project manager Jagdish Aphale, its builders expect tens of millions of Hindu pilgrims to visit the temple each year. Immense sums from government coffers have poured into Ayodhya to give the city’s dilapidated infrastructure a facelift ahead of the inauguration. A new international airport will open on Saturday, road and rail connections have been upgraded and a crop of new hotels have sprung up almost overnight. Sidewalks and pillars have been decorated with the saffron flags and marigold flowers used in Hindu festivities to welcome travellers. “So many pilgrims have already started pouring into the city,” said Shubh Mangal, a 52-year-old who makes his living selling flowers and other offerings for Hindu worshippers. “My profits have doubled. We are all overjoyed.” ‘Full of dread’ Ram is one of the most revered deities in the Hindu pantheon as the protagonist of the Ramayana, one of the faith’s two foundational epics, which chronicles his battles with the demon-king Ravana. Devout Hindus believe that Ram was born in Ayodhya around 7,000 years ago but that during the rule of the Mughal Empire, the Babri Masjid mosque was built on top of his birthplace in the 16th century. Modi’s presence at the inauguration is effectively the opening salvo in his campaign for re-election later in 2024. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has campaigned for decades to build a temple on the site and its activists were instrumental in the mosque’s demolition. One senior BJP leader travelled around the country to rally the faithful to the cause in a Toyota sedan fitted to resemble Ram’s mythical chariot — a procession that sparked multiple religious riots in its wake. The mosque was torn down by a mob in 1992, triggering another wave of riots across the country that killed 2,000 people, mostly Muslims. Its destruction was a hammer blow to the foundations of India’s secular political order, paving the way for the rise of Hindu nationalism to become the country’s dominant political force. The site lay dormant for decades before a Supreme Court decision in 2019 permitted construction of the Ram temple. Haji Mehboob, a witness for the losing side of that case, said Modi’s presence at the temple’s inauguration was another milestone in the increasing entanglement of Hindu worship and politics. “The prime minister of a secular country is coming to inaugurate a Hindu temple… with an eye on winning the 2024 elections by reaching out to his Hindu base,” he told AFP. “The Muslim community in Ayodhya is full of dread over what the future holds for them.”",
