[Amaris Encinas](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5133245001/amaris-encinas/) The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests.

What does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? [Numerology is an ancient esoteric science](https://www.britannica.com/topic/numerology) that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist [Novalee Wilder](https://www.novaleewilder.com/) shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer [Narayana Montúfar](https://www.naramon.com/) told [ Farmer’s Almanac ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.

If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.

    "text": "Read full article Yahoo Sports A's closer Mason Miller fractures left hand, which could affect whether he's traded Oakland may not trade the low-cost reliever anyway yahoo sports staff Fri, Jul 26, 2024, 4:00 a.m. · 3 min read Link Copied\nMason Miller figures to be one of the most popular targets for playoff contenders at the MLB trade deadline. For now, however, the rocket-armed reliever will be unavailable for the next two weeks.\nThe Oakland Athletics placed Miller on the 15-day injured list on Thursday with a fractured pinky finger on his left hand. Yet the broken finger is on his non-pitching hand. And the A's put Miller on the IL retroactive to July 23 , which means he would be eligible to return on Aug. 7.\nAfter Miller's injury was reported, there were differing stories as to how he broke his finger. Initially, Miller reportedly fractured his hand by pounding it on a training table in frustration. Then the story was that Miller \"put his hand down awkwardly\" on the table while preparing to do an exercise, according to MLB.com's Martin Gallegos .\nHowever, A's manager Mark Kotsay indicated that Miller did indeed hurt himself in an emotional outburst.\n\"Out of a little frustration, he just kind of pounded his fist down on a padded training table out of emotion,\" said Kotsay, via MLB.com's Brent Maguire . \"We've all been there, done that.\"\nHere’s what A’s manager Mark Kotsay had to say about Mason Miller’s fractured pinky and the reporting provided by @MartinJGallegos earlier today. pic.twitter.com/bMpYeHnr7O\n— Brent Maguire (@bmags94) July 25, 2024\nThe prevailing thought is that Oakland is unlikely to trade Miller because he's still under five years of club control after this season. He isn't even eligible for arbitration until the 2027 season when his salary will increase.\nThat currently makes Miller the sort of low-cost asset that a small market team like the A's prefers to keep. And it almost certainly means that Oakland is asking for a huge amount in return for a player that they don't want to – or have to – trade yet.\nThe A's could also switch Miller back to a starting pitcher, according to The Athletic's Tyler Kepner. He was a starter in the minors before being called up last season and started six games for the A's last season. As a starter, Miller could be an even more valuable asset in the future.\nMiller, soon to turn 26, has struck out 70 batters in 40 2/3 innings with a 2.21 ERA and 15 saves in 34 appearances. He wowed a national audience during the MLB All-Star Game when he hit 103.6 mph on the radar gun. Every one of the fastballs he threw during his appearance was over 100 mph. No MLB pitcher has thrown more pitchers at 100 mph or higher this season than Miller, who's done it 306 times.\nMason Miller going Medieval on Juan Soto . 🥴\n3 Pitch K: 87mph Slider, 101mph and 102mph ⛽️\nOverlay of Slider & 102mph FB at the end. pic.twitter.com/wT37jeVxSL\n— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) April 26, 2024\nIn the meantime, Oakland activated pitcher Ross Stripling from the 15-day IL to take Miller's place on the roster.\nThis likely won't be the last time Miller is discussed as a strong trade possibility for the A's. It just might not happen this season, broken hand or not.",

    "text": "MELBOURNE, Jan 16: Inspired American teenager Learner Tien outlasted three-times Australian Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev to reach the third round with a 6-3 7-6(4) 6-7(8) 1-6 7-6(7) victory in a late-night epic on Thursday.\nQualifier Tien’s seemed to be fading after fifth seed Medvedev saved a match point with an ace in the third set tiebreak and stormed back from two sets down to set up a decider on Margaret Court Arena. But the 19-year-old tapped into his last reserves of energy to become youngest American man to reach the third round at the Australian Open since Pete Sampras did so aged 18 in 1990.\nMedvedev looked clear favourite in the decider with Tien clearly fatigued but the world number 121 courageously stayed with the Russian in a series of gruelling rallies.\nAfter a brief rain delay and with the clock approaching 3am, Medvedev served for the match at 6-5 but Tien refused to go away and broke back to send the contest into a first-to-10 deciding tiebreak.\nMedvedev led 6-4 but Tien stormed back to claim a sensational victory on his first match point as a weary Medvedev floated a return over the baseline to bring the near five-hour tussle to an end.\nSWIATEK IN ROUND 3\nIga Swiatek rushed through the first set in 26 minutes and completed her 6-0, 6-2 second-round win over Rebecca Sramkova in an hour at the Australian Open.\nThe five-time Grand Slam champion makes a habit of advancing quickly through the early rounds at the majors. She’s won almost 12% of her sets in Grand Slams by 6-0, which puts her in exclusive company.\nSo when No. 49-ranked Sramkova ended a seven-game losing run by holding serve on Thursday, she raised her arm to acknowledge the applause from the Rod Laver Arena crowd. It was one of the few chances she had to celebrate.\n“It was good to play in such an efficient way and just finish it quick,” Swiatek said. “Also, you know, just feel the court and how it is in RLA.” Second-seeded Swiatek next faces 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu, who recovered from an early break in the second set to hold off Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-5.\nKOKKINAKIS KYRGIOS RETIRE\nNick Kyrgios’ return to the Australian Open is over after he and Thanasi Kokkinakis stopped playing while trailing in the second set of their first-round doubles on Thursday night.\nKyrgios and Kokkinakis, the men’s doubles champions at Melbourne Park in 2022, retired while down 7-5, 3-2 against another Australian team, James Duckworth and Aleksandar Vukic.\nBoth Kyrgios (strained abdominal muscle) and Kokkinakis (right shoulder trouble) came into the match dealing with physical issues after losses in singles.\nDanielle Collins got into a back-and-forth with a booing crowd at the Australian Open after eliminating a local player on Thursday night, blowing kisses to the spectators and repeating the phrase, “How about that?!”\nThe 10th-seeded Collins, an American who was the runner-up to Australia’s Ash Barty in the 2022 final, defeated Destanee Aiava 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-2 across nearly 2 1/2 hours.\nThat’s when the fun began. First, the 31-year-old Collins — who originally planned to retire after last season but decided to return to the tour in 2025 — held her hand to her left ear and, looking into the stands at Kia Arena, said that three-word phrase a couple of times.\nThen, as the jeers grew louder, she began blowing kisses toward the fans.\n“The people that don’t like you, and the people that hate you, they actually pay your bills. Obviously my professional career is not going to last forever,” Collins said at her news conference, noting that anyone who “bought a ticket to come out here and heckle me, it’s all going toward the Danielle Collins Fund.” (Agencies)",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "mundiales Los rostros de los que se hablará en 2024 Con la esperanza de que los conflictos armados acaben de una vez, el nuevo año busca la paz y la normalidad de la mano de personajes de distintos ámbitos de los que se hablará a lo largo de los próximos doce meses. En Estados Unidos se prevé un nuevo enfrentamiento entre el demócrata Joe Biden y el republicano Donald Trump, dos presidentes con aspiraciones presidenciales, aunque no hay que descartar a otros aspirantes. Los nombres de los actores Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) y Margot Robbie (`Barbie´) suenan con fuerza entre los posibles ganadores del Óscar. En el apartado musical, importantes giras acaparan la atención. Entre ellas la del mexicano Luis Miguel, también la de sus compatriotas Maná o la estadounidense Taylor Swift, que desplegará su potencial musical en Europa. El nuevo año viene cargado de grandes acontecimientos e importantes fechas. Un año bisiesto, que esperemos, no se ciña al refrán de “año bisiesto, año siniestro”, en el que se hablará, y mucho, de la XXXIII edición de los Juegos Olímpicos, que por tercera vez se celebrarán en París, la gran cita del año, que comenzará el 26 de julio y terminará el 11 de agosto. La capital francesa se convertirá en la segunda ciudad, tras Londres, en organizar en tres ocasiones una edición olímpica, un evento que tendrá como novedad la inclusión del “breaking”, el baile callejero, también conocido como “break dance”, como nuevo deporte y contará con una ceremonia de inauguración muy especial: por primera vez en la historia, la apertura de los Juegos Olímpicos no tendrá lugar en un estadio. El 26 de julio los atletas desfilarán en barcos en el río Sena. El protagonismo será de los 10.500 deportistas, especialmente de atletas como la venezolana Yulimar Rojas, que aspira a su revalidar la medalla de oro de triple salto conseguida en Tokio 2020, y los maratonianos de Kenia Eliud Kipchoge y Kelvin Kiptum, aspirantes a rebajar el crono de las dos horas. Protagonismo también tendrá la mascota oficial de los Juegos Olímpicos y Paralímpicos (del 28 de agosto al 8 de septiembre), denominada “Phryge”, unas pequeñas figuras inspiradas en los gorros frigios rojos, icono de la Revolución Francesa (1789-1799), que los organizadores esperan sean visibles en todo el mundo. Además de los Juegos Olímpicos y Paralímpicos, el año viene de lo más deportivo. En 2024 se disputarán la Eurocopa de Alemania (del 14 de junio al 14 de julio) con Italia defendiendo el título logrado en 2021; la Copa América, en esta ocasión en Estados Unidos, del 20 de junio al 14 de julio, y con 16 selecciones en juego (las diez integrantes de la CONMEBOL más Estados Unidos, México, Trinidad y Tobago, Canadá, Panamá, Jamaica y Honduras o Costa Rica), y Messi y Argentina defendiendo el campeonato logrado en 2021. Si es poco fútbol, la Copa de África en Costa de Marfil, del 13 de enero al 11 de febrero; y la Copa de Asia, que debía haberse disputado en 2023, pero que ha sido aplazada a 2024, en Catar, entre el 12 de enero y el 10 de febrero, son otros platos fuertes del año. UN AÑO CON GRAN ACTIVIDAD POLÍTICA. Si 2024 viene cargado de acontecimientos deportivos, en lo político no decae. Las elecciones presidenciales de Estados Unidos, programadas para el 5 de noviembre, y las de México, el 2 de junio, acaparan la atención informativa del año. En Estados Unidos se prevé un nuevo enfrentamiento entre el demócrata Joe Biden y el republicano Donald Trump -si los procesos judiciales que tiene abiertos se lo permiten-, dos presidentes con aspiraciones presidenciales, aunque no hay que descartar a otros aspirantes. Como rival de Biden entre los demócratas emerge la escritora de autoayuda Marianne Williamson, mientras que Trump tendrá como oponente, entre otros, a otra mujer, Nikki Haley, exgobernadora de Carolina del Sur y exembajadora ante las Naciones Unidas durante el gobierno de Trump. En México, la elección del sucesor de Andrés López Obrador tiene como principales aspirantes a dos mujeres y se presupone que México tendrá en 2024 a su primera mujer como presidenta de la nación. La pugna está entre Claudia Sheinbaum, por el oficialista Movimiento de Regeneración Nacional (Morena) y sus aliados (Partido del Trabajo y el Partido Verde), y Xóchitl Gálvez, por el Frente Amplio por México, con gran favoritismo para la primera según las últimas encuestas. LOS ÓSCAR. El mundo del cine estará muy atento a lo que suceda en la próxima entrega de los Óscar, la 96.ª edición, prevista para el 10 de marzo, y con gran favoritismo para dos películas que ya dejaron un gran impacto en 2023: `Barbie´ y `Oppenheimer´. Los nombres de los actores Cillian Murphy (`Oppenheimer) y Margot Robbie (`Barbie´) suenan con fuerza entre los posibles ganadores a la dorada estatuilla, como los directores de ambas películas, Christopher Nolan (`Oppenheimer´) y Greta Gerwig (`Barbie´), con permiso de Martin Scorsese, autor de `Los asesinos de la luna´. Además de los premios cinematográficos que se sucederán a lo largo del año, en 2024 está previsto el estreno de “María”, la película dirigida por el chileno Pablo Larrain sobre la soprano Maria Callas, a quien dará vida Angelina Jolie. “Gladiator 2”, dirigida por Ridley Scott y protagonizada por Denzel Washington, es otra de las novedades más esperadas del nuevo año. El chileno Pedro Pascal también forma parte del reparto. En el apartado musical, importantes giras acaparan la atención. Entre ellas la del mexicano Luis Miguel, también la de sus compatriotas Maná o la estadounidense Taylor Swift, que desplegará su potencial musical en Europa, además de la salida del último disco de la banda inglesa de heavy metal Judas Priest que lleva por título \"Invencible Shiel\" En el ámbito literario, el 24 de enero está previsto el esperado lanzamiento del último libro del español Eduardo Mendoza, `Tres enigmas para la Organización´, mientras que los seguidores del japonés Haruki Murakami esperan la edición en español de `The City and its Uncertain Walls´ (La ciudad y sus muros inciertos), publicada en japonés en abril de 2023, su primera novela en los últimos seis años. EFEMÉRIDES IMPORTANTES. El papa Francisco seguirá dando noticias, máxime si se cumple su prometido viaje a su país natal, muy posible a lo largo de 2024, la primera vez que pondrá los pies en Argentina como pontífice. El 2024 hará un hueco a personajes históricos como Marco Polo, de quien se cumplen 700 años de su muerte; al líder soviético Vladímir Lenin, en el centenario de su fallecimiento; el escultor español Eduardo Chillida, de quien se cumple cien años de su nacimiento o el 80 aniversario de la desaparición del pintor noruego Edvard Munch, autor de `El grito o los 70 de la artista mexicana Frida Kahlo.

    "text": "Tile examined data to understand the prevalence of Alzheimer's, the dangers of wandering, and what families can do to avoid the problem. - candy candy // Shutterstock Keerthi Vedantam, Data Work By Elena Cox As America’s population ages, rates of Alzheimer’s disease diagnoses are rising. One consequence of the degenerative brain disorder is wandering, which can be dangerous—and sometimes deadly—for those struggling with short- and long-term memory loss.\nAlzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by a loss of cognitive function over time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, individuals with the disease may show signs of memory loss, poor judgment, and mood changes. Patients are prone to losing items and money and have a hard time completing everyday tasks for themselves. People with Alzheimer’s may even experience a gradual decline or become confused and have trouble recognizing family members or familiar environments over time.\nThe number of people with the disease is expected to more than double in the next 40 years, from 6.1 million patients in 2020 to around 14 million in 2060, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.\nA 2021 Capital Caring Health and WebMD national survey found that while 9 in 10 aging adults want to age in place, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s and the risk of wandering can put them in danger. Wandering can occur at home, outside, or whenever a person with Alzheimer’s leaves a safe environment or the oversight of a caregiver. Six in 10 people with dementia will wander at least once, but many do so repeatedly, the Alzheimer’s Association reported. Vulnerable adults who lack supervision are at risk of getting lost or being taken advantage of without their medication, money, or family guidance.\nWandering is often triggered by restlessness, boredom, fear, or agitation. Alzheimer’s patients may not be aware of their surroundings, which puts them at risk of getting lost, falling, or even ingesting harmful substances. Wandering can also be accidental: An adult can leave their house to go to the grocery store but get lost along the way.\nTragically, the effects of wandering can be fatal. In an analysis of over 300 newspaper reports published in the journal BMC Geriatrics in 2011, researchers at the University of Florida found that 2 in 5 individuals with dementia who went missing were found dead the following day. Older adults who wander risk dehydration, exacerbating medical concerns, exposure to extreme and prolonged cold or heat, or being hit by a car.\nTile examined CDC data and peer-reviewed research to illustrate the scope of Alzheimer’s, the dangers of wandering, and the steps families can take to protect their loved ones.\nTile What to do after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis In 2022, the CDC reported over 120,100 people with Alzheimer’s died due to the disease, making it the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States.\nPeople with Alzheimer’s may also be prone to “sundowning,” which refers to a difference in behavior that occurs during the later half of the day. Hallucinations, mood swings, or delusions make sleeping difficult and magnify any chronic distress, leading patients to want to escape their environment and wander.\nIt’s important to remember the risk of wandering may clash with an older adult’s wish to maintain an independent lifestyle. These conflicts may aggravate the stress of the situation for both Alzheimer’s patients and their caregivers.\nAfter an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, experts encourage family members to immediately talk to the patient about getting involved in decisions about their home and lifestyle. While this may cause friction, being proactive can help protect Alzheimer’s patients’ well-being in the long run.\nThe National Institute on Aging suggests preparing the home of an Alzheimer’s patient to be as safe as possible. To prevent patients from falling, homes with staircases need handrails and safety grips or carpets on the stairs. Any small step-ups or electrical cords that could cause someone to trip need to be removed. Any harmful products, such as cleaners or paint thinner, should be removed or inaccessible. The NIA also advises caregivers to remove any upholstery with busy patterns that might overwhelm a patient with Alzheimer’s, as overstimulation can trigger wandering.\nTo prevent Alzheimer’s patients from wandering away while respecting their need for independence and movement, the NIA suggests that caregivers provide safe wandering environments, like a garden or a clear walking path. Since boredom and restlessness can cause wandering, caregivers can build an encouraging environment that involves daily tasks and creative projects to help engage them and pass the time. Caregivers should also implement a security and GPS tracking system in the patient’s home and car that allows loved ones to monitor them from afar.\nThe risk of wandering is a reality for Alzheimer’s patients and their loved ones. Yet with the proper tools and a support system in place, caregivers can reduce the dangers it can bring.\nStory editing by Alizah Salario. Additional editing by Kelly Glass.

With a few more days left in the month, both the Flint and Saginaw areas are recording the second warmest month of December on record. Only December 2015 was warmer in both areas. Temperature records from the National Weather Service go back to 1912 in Saginaw and 1921 in Flint. Over the past four weeks, temperatures in Flint have averaged more than 10 degrees above normal. The Saginaw area has seen temperatures 9 degrees warmer than normal. The weather forecast for the final three days of December 2023 shows a continuation of warmer than average temperatures across Mid-Michigan. High temperatures in the region should reach the low 40s on Friday and near 40 on Saturday before dropping slightly into the upper 30s for Sunday. Average temperatures for late December in Flint and Saginaw are 32 degrees. A clipper system on Saturday may bring some light snow showers, but accumulations will be minor.

    "text": "Commission rejects petition to bar Trump from Wisconsin ballot, complaint headed to court [Jessie Opoien](https://www.jsonline.com/staff/12042691002/jessie-opoien/) MADISON – The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Thursday swiftly threw out a petition to bar former President Donald Trump from the state's 2024 presidential ballot because it was filed with the wrong state officials. Kirk Bangstad, a Democratic activist and firebrand owner of the Minocqua Brewing Co., filed the petition Thursday afternoon with the state's election agency. Bangstad alleges that Trump violated a [provision of the 14th Amendment](https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/02nd_Judicial_District/Denver_District_Court/11_17_2023%20Final%20Order.pdf) that disqualifies certain officials who take part in an insurrection from holding office again, based on his actions surrounding [violence at the U.S. Capitol](/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/20/colorado-ballot-ruling-trump-supreme-court-2024-insurrection/71894485007/) on Jan. 6, 2021. But the Wisconsin Elections Commission disposed of Bangstad's complaint without consideration, a move that likely shifts the issue to the courts. In an email to commissioners, a staff attorney said because Bangstad filed the complaint against commissioners directly, the complaint would be disposed of without consideration. \"It is the position of the Commission and its staff that a complaint against the Commission, against Commissioners in their official capacities, or against Commission staff, warrants an ethical recusal by the body,\" the attorney wrote. Not only is recusal the policy in this situation, the commission itself has no role in placing candidates on the presidential ballot. That's done by a presidential preference selection committee, which state law requires to be composed of the state chairperson of a state party organization or the chairperson's designee, one national committeeman and one national committeewoman designated by the state chairperson, the speaker and the minority leader of the Assembly or their designees, and the president and the minority leader of the Senate or their designees. The committee is required by state law to place the names \"of all candidates whose candidacy is generally advocated or recognized in the national news media throughout the United States\" on the ballot, and may include additional names. \"It seems pretty obvious that Mr. Bangstad is interested in getting to the court, because the commission cannot address a complaint against itself,\" WEC chairman Don Millis told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"This is a policy; it's well known by anyone who pays attention. So, to me, this is perhaps a ploy to get into circuit court faster. But, more fundamentally, the commission has no role in placing any candidate on the presidential ballot. The statutes make it very clear that there's a presidential preference committee.\" Bangstad acknowledged his hope that the issue will ultimately be settled by the state Supreme Court, which in August [flipped to a liberal majority](/story/news/politics/2023/08/01/janet-protasiewicz-will-be-sworn-in-today-to-wisconsin-supreme-court/70501202007/) for the first time in years. Wisconsin's presidential primary is April 2 and the general election is Nov. 5. \"Why am I doing this? First of all, (U.S. Attorney General) Merrick Garland spent a year-and-a-half not doing anything to try to prosecute Donald Trump at the federal level, and our Attorney General Josh Kaul has yet to do anything to hold … politicians from Wisconsin accountable for being part of the conspiracy to overthrow our election,\" Bangstad told reporters after filing the complaint at the elections commission office in Madison. \"I am simply a brewer from northern Wisconsin, but I care about my country, and I care about democracy.\" Bangstad's complaint requests the members of the bipartisan commission find that Trump is disqualified from serving as president and refuse to allow him access to the 2024 Republican primary ballot. He said he expected the commission to reject his complaint, and said he plans to challenge the decision in Dane County Circuit Court, \"where there are very smart judges.\" \"It's pivotal that somebody at least try in Wisconsin to do this, because I believe it is the law and it was intended to be the law after the Civil War,\" Bangstad said. The move follows competing rulings on the same issue in Colorado and Michigan. Last week, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump was barred from another term — and therefore banned from the state’s primary ballot — by violating the 14th Amendment. The Colorado Republican Party has [asked the U.S. Supreme Court](/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/27/colorado-gop-appeals-decision-disqualifying-donald-trump-2024/72043874007/) to review the decision. On Wednesday, the Michigan Supreme Court rejected an appeal designed to keep Trump off the state's ballot, choosing not to overturn a lower court's decision that parties can place [whichever candidates they choose on presidential primary ballots](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/4b0d49/siteassets/case-documents/uploads/sct/public/orders/166470_142_01.pdf). Several other states have dismissed similar challenges. The commission has twice voted unanimously to reject complaints against the 10 Republican electors who met in state Capitol on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign paperwork falsely claiming to be electors for Trump. Reports [have indicated](/story/news/politics/2023/12/08/fake-elector-plotter-chesebro-reported-to-be-helping-wisconsin-probe/71850444007/) an attorney who helped design the fake electors scheme is cooperating with Wisconsin investigators, but Kaul has maintained that the state Department of Justice does not \"confirm or deny the existence of investigations.\" Bangstad is a former Democratic candidate for the U.S. House and state Assembly who has since created a political action committee using his brewery's namesake to [raise money for Democratic causes](/story/news/politics/2023/11/07/minocqua-brewing-company-kirk-bangstad-uses-pac-to-support-democrats/71298366007/). The brewery produces beer with politically themed names like \"Fair Maps\" and \"Bernie Brew.\" He has been active in the state's courts. Earlier this month, the state Supreme Court [declined to hear a lawsuit](/story/news/politics/2023/12/13/wisconsin-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-suit-to-end-voucher-programs/71910522007/) funded by Bangstad's super PAC seeking to eliminate funding for the state's four taxpayer-funded school voucher programs and independent charter schools. He plans to pursue the lawsuit through circuit court. Bangstad was also ordered in October [to pay $750,000](/story/news/politics/2023/10/30/minocqua-brewing-co-owner-ordered-to-pay-750000-for-defamation/71381680007/) for defaming Lakeland Times publisher Gregg Walker in posts on the brewery's popular social media outlets. It was the state's largest defamation judgment. The Minocqua Brewing Company super PAC also funded an unsuccessful [lawsuit](/story/news/politics/2022/03/10/lawsuit-accuses-ron-johnson-scott-fitzgerald-and-tom-tiffany-aiding-insurrection/6988099001/) alleging U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Reps. Scott Fitzgerald and Tom Tiffany conspired before the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol to keep Joe Biden from becoming president.

    "text": "17th October 2024 Vice President Kashim Shettima\nBy Stephen Angbulu Kindly share this story:\nSouth Korean digital wallet service, Gluwa, and Swedish Telecoms giant, Ericsson, are among several investors who pledged investments and partnerships worth at least $119m in Nigeria’s digital economy, health and other critical sectors.\nThis came as Vice President Kashim Shettima assured global investors of Nigeria’s openness for business during a meeting with Swedish companies in Stockholm on Thursday.\nShettima said investors can now take unfettered advantage of Nigeria’s ever-growing investment climate, which currently provides limitless opportunities for serious investments.\nSenior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Communication, Stanley Nkwocha, revealed details of Thursday’s talks in a statement titled, ‘At business forum in Sweden: VP Shettima woos investors to Nigeria’s growing business climate.’\nAccording to Shettima, the Nigerian government, under President Bola Tinubu, has undertaken bold reforms that are restructuring the nation’s economy for sustainable growth, just as the administration’s Renewed Hope Agenda is focused on a competitive business environment that attracts both foreign and domestic investments.\nSpeaking at Epicenter, Stockholm, Sweden, where he is currently on a two-day working visit, the VP noted that Nigeria and Sweden have a time-honoured history of cooperation, particularly in trade, technology and sustainable development.\nHe cited opportunities in Nigeria, including the digital economy, agriculture, renewable energy, and MSMEs, among many others, pointing out that the nation is now “an ambitious nation, bound by the limitless potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.”\nAt the business forum with the theme, ‘Trade and Investments with a Focus on the Digital Economy, Agriculture, and Renewable Energy,’ the VP affirmed that the Tinubu administration has done much within the last year to brighten Nigeria’s investment climate, creating vast investment opportunities.\nHe stated: “Under the leadership of His Excellency, President Bola Tinubu, the Nigerian government has introduced bold financial reforms, including the unification of exchange rates and the removal of fuel subsidies. Though challenging, these reforms are necessary steps in restructuring the economy for sustainable growth.\n“The government’s ‘Renewed Hope Agenda’ emphasizes creating a competitive business environment that attracts both foreign and domestic investments.\n“In parallel, our financial sector reforms, such as the revised Cashless Policy and Open Banking Framework, have revolutionised banking services, promoting financial inclusion and providing innovative financial products.”\nIdentifying digital economy, agriculture, and renewable energy as global priorities and the direction in which Nigeria is headed, the Nigerian Vice President said these sectors are crucial to addressing pressing global challenges such as food security, climate change, and economic growth.\nImploring Swedish investors to avail themselves of the business opportunities that abound in Nigeria, he said, “Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, there is tremendous potential for collaboration between Nigeria and Sweden across multiple sectors.\n“Whether in finance, renewable energy, digital innovation, agriculture, or education, our partnership holds the promise of immense benefits for both nations.\n“I urge Swedish investors to seize the opportunities in Nigeria and work with us to build a prosperous and sustainable future.”\nHe said Nigeria’s digital economy is one of the fastest-growing sectors in Africa, contributing significantly to GDP. The nation’s fintech ecosystem, led by companies such as Flutterwave and Paystack, attracts global attention, “with Nigerian tech start-ups receiving over $1bn in funding in 2022.”\nThe Vice President urged Swedish investors to deploy their expertise in technology and innovation to collaborate with Nigerian start-ups, driving growth and creating jobs. He stressed that the partnership between both countries can accelerate this transition.\nOn agriculture, he said that while Nigeria is working to modernise the sector, Swedish expertise in agriculture technology could assist the nation in achieving this through investments in precision farming, mechanisation, and value-chain development to improve productivity and food security.\nWelcoming the Vice President earlier, Edgar Luczak, Chairman, Partner & Head of Advisory, Epicenter, Sweden, noted that the future is digital and sustainable, assuring that the Epicenter was ready to engage not just in words but in action.

We see a situation where, once we launch our satellite in December this year, we can connect direct satellite to WiFi.\n“This is going to be a very big win for Nigeria and a very big win for the technology ecosystem. We have given about $100 million in loans.\n“It is not just about disbursing loans, it is not just about trying to grow portfolios, it is really about giving back. We are pushing for a lot of impact, and we are also working with the government and presidency to train people on digital skills,” he said.\nMeanwhile, the Managing Director of Ericsson Nigeria, Mr. Peter Ogundele, has revealed the company’s plan to build a technology hub worth about $19m in Nigeria.\nHe said, “Nigeria has enough youths that can come into that field. We can train them, Ericsson will also take part in it, and some of them we can export to the world, and we will be like another India.\n“Ericsson was the first to have over 1,000 sites in Nigeria and continues to invest in the country. We have been here since 1978, and for us, our partnership is an enduring one.”\nOn her part, Ms. Anthonia Huard, Regional Director, North & West Africa, Energy & Transport Lead, said Nigeria has become the country’s focal point in Africa for optimal engagement.\n“To be efficient in Africa, the organisation focused on prioritising markets of which Nigeria is one and matched the areas of focus of Sweden to the needs and focus of the countries for optimal engagement,” she stated.\nAlso, Swedfund’s Director, Project Accelerator, Mr. Hakan Danhltor, expressed the organisation’s commitment to reducing poverty and supporting sustainable development through investments in the private sector and local private companies.\nFor her part, Mikaela Edstrom of the Swedish Export Credit Agency said the agency is closely watching the ongoing economic reforms taking place in Nigeria and views them as positive for the future.\n“We can, together with our sister organisation, provide a world-class export credit system for Nigeria,” Edstrom pledged.\nShettima held bilateral talks with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maria Stenergard and Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, Ebba Busch. The discussions focused on strengthening ties and exploring new areas of cooperation between Nigeria and Sweden.\nHe also visited the Royal Palace, where talks centred on deepening cultural ties and reinforcing the partnership between the two nations.\nOthers who joined the Vice President at the meetings included Plateau State Governor, Caleb Mutfwang; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yusuf Tuggar; Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure, Khalil Halilu; Director-General, National Information Technology Development Agency, Kashifu Abdullahi; Executive Vice-Chairman, Nigerian Communication Commission, Aminu Maida, and some members of the Nigerian Swedish Embassy in Stockholm.
