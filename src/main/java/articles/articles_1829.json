    "text": "Shemar Moore and Jesiree Dizon Split After Almost 5 Years Together\nShemar Moore, Jesiree Dizon Call It Quits ... After Almost 5 Years!!!\nShemar Moore and Jesiree Dizon have gone their separate ways ... the \"S.W.A.T\" star and the model are no longer a couple ... TMZ has learned.\nSources close to the former couple tell TMZ ... Shemar and his girlfriend split recently, but have remained cordial in the aftermath of the breakup.\nWe're told the two still, and always will be, loving friends and co-parents ... as they're committed to raising their daughter, Frankie Melelina Kapule Moore, together.\nSources say both Shemar and Jesiree are determined to give young Frankie the happiest and healthiest life possible.\nThis relationship update comes nearly a week after Shemar indicated on \"The Jennifer Hudson Show\" that he had no interest in having another child anytime soon.\nAs the 54-year-old told host Jennifer Hudson at the time, he felt his home was \"full\" and noted he wanted \"to give it all to my baby girl\" moving forward.\nShemar and Jesiree actually have a lengthy history together, first dating all the way back in 2008 ... but the pair split when SM wasn't quite ready to settle down. Jesiree is also a mom to kids Charli and Kaiden, who she welcomed in prior relationships.\nHowever, the twosome reconnected in 2020, after Shemar lost his mother, Marilyn.\nThe couple then went on to welcome their daughter Frankie, who was born in January 2023.\nBoth Shemar and Jesiree documented intimate aspects of their home life together, which seemed to be very happy ... that is until recently.",

    "text": "The College of New Jersey will partner with Friends of Hopewell Valley Open Space and the Outdoor Equity Alliance to launch a new internship program aimed at diversifying the land stewardship workforce.\nA $49,990 Watershed Restoration and Community Engagement Program grant, awarded by New Jersey Audubon through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, will fund this initiative.\nThe program seeks to enhance the representation of non-white and first-generation college students in the conservation field and promote the stewardship of vital watersheds.\nFour TCNJ first-generation students have been selected as interns for this pilot program: Jalissa Colon ’25 , a civil engineering major; Julian Delemos ’25 , a public health major; Katherine Zumba ’27 , a public health major; and Myara Gomez ’25 , who is majoring in journalism and professional writing.\n“We are thrilled for the TCNJ interns to learn from experts at FoHVOS and OEA as they join a new generation of land stewards with tools to shape conservation efforts on campus and across Ewing,” said Wendy Clement , chair of TCNJ’s Department of Biology. “These students bring an excitement to their work that will be sure to inspire others in creating a more sustainable and inclusive future.”\nThe students will work on conservation efforts focused on land owned by TCNJ and Ewing Township, all within the Shabakunk Creek watershed. Their contributions will directly support the stewardship of local lands, which is vital to maintaining the quality of water draining into the Delaware River.\n“I have a passion for sustainability and this is a great opportunity,” Gomez said. “I hope to gain environmental writing experience and learn even more about how I can participate in stewardship opportunities in Trenton and Ewing.”\nThrough the program, students will learn skills such as native plant identification, data management, and conservation planning. They will also participate in professional development opportunities and network with industry leaders, opening doors for future careers in land stewardship.\nFoHVOS Executive Director Jenn Rogers said that the organization has been a leader in collaborating with the community to create impactful conservation.\n“This grant makes it possible for our stewardship team to expand our community-focused efforts in many exciting ways, including a new relationship with Ewing Township and creating a college-level internship with OEA,” she said. “Our goal is for this program to become a model for other New Jersey colleges and universities to integrate student-empowered conservation planning and action into their campuses.”\nThe $49,990 grant is part of a larger $228,000 award for projects promoting watershed restoration and community engagement. Leaders from FoHVOS and OEA hope this pilot program will serve as a model for other schools and municipalities to develop their own stewardship initiatives.\nFoHVOS is a non-profit land trust dedicated to preserving the valley’s character by partnering with the community to preserve land, protect natural resources, and inspire a new generation of conservation. The land trust manages nearly 3,000 acres of preserves and 17 miles of hiking trails.\nThe Outdoor Equity Alliance, based in Trenton, is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating equitable access to nature for all communities and inspiring a diverse new generation of environmental leaders.",

    "text": "02 agosto 2024 a a a L'Italia continua a vivere nella morsa di un caldo eccezionale . Anche venerdì 2 agosto, il Sud Italia sarà alle prese con temperature record, con picchi di 43-44°C nelle zone interne della Sardegna e della Sicilia. Anche la Lombardia e l'Emilia-Romagna - spiega Mario Giuliacci sul suo sito personale - toccano con mano un caldo fuori dal comune. Nel frattempo, sull'arco alpino sono previsti temporali intensi che si estenderanno alle pianure circostanti. Anche parte del Centro Italia vedrà alcuni rovesci.\nClicca qui per leggere i bollettini meteo completi sul sito di Mario Giuliacci\nDurante la notte e la mattina di sabato 3 agosto sono infatti previste piogge e raffiche di vento sull'Alto Adriatico , che successivamente interesseranno le regioni centrali e parte del Nord-Est. Si verificheranno rovesci localizzati dalla riviera romagnola fino al Lazio, circostanza che offrirà una temporanea tregua dal caldo infernale che ha picchiato durissimo su queste zone per lunghe settimane. Tuttavia, si tratterà soltanto di cuna breve pausa: da lunedì 5 agosto, l'anticiclone africano tornerà a dominare, riguadagnando terreno sulla nostra Penisola. Insomma, il caldo estremo tornerà nel giro di pochi giorni.\nLa prossima settimana - prosegue Giuliacci - vedrà l'anticiclone africano come protagonista indiscusso , con un'espansione che raggiungerà anche il centro dell'Europa. Le temperature inizieranno nuovamente a salire, specialmente a partire da martedì 6 agosto. Le zone più colpite saranno la Pianura Padana, i settori tirrenici di Toscana e Lazio, le due Isole Maggiori e la Puglia.\nMeteo, allarme-Giuliacci: temperature estreme, perché il tramonto è il momento più pericoloso",
