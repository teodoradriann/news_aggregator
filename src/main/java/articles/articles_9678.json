    "text": "Ukraine has welcomed Australia’s largest military aid package that includes air defence missiles, air-to-ground weapons and anti-tank weapons with its envoy signalling a defence pact as a logical next step.\nDefence Minister Richard Marles unveiled a $250 million package during a NATO security summit in Washington, focused on Ukraine’s security amid Russia’s ongoing war.\nThere was renewed emphasis on air defence systems after a barrage of Russian missiles killed about 40 people across the country and struck a children’s hospital in the capital Kyiv.\n🤝 Many thanks to Australia for announcing the largest single military assistance package, worth nearly $250 million.\nAt the NATO Summit @RichardMarlesMP reaffirmed Australia’s commitment to standing with Ukraine in its defence against Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/f0RfM9gg1L\n— Embassy of Ukraine in Australia and New Zealand (@UKRinAUS) July 11, 2024\nUkrainian ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko welcomed the new package, saying the air defences were exactly what his nation needed.\n“I’m very pleased to see the Australian government is stepping up assistance to Ukraine,” he told AAP.\n“I think this is also a reaction to what Russia is doing here in the region, what Russia is doing with North Korea after the signing of the security agreement.”\nRussia and China signing a “no limits” pact on the eve of Moscow’s invasion “was hugely consequential for the world” and those in the Indo-Pacific would take lessons from what happened in Ukraine, Mr Marles said.\nAustralia supported NATO nations branding China a “decisive enabler”, he said.\n Air defences are exactly what Ukraine needs, ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko says. Image by Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS A bilateral security or defence pact between the two nations, similar to what other G7 countries had signed with Ukraine, “would be a logical step forward given how consistent Australian support is”, Mr Myroshnychenko said.\nAustralia would continue to work with Ukraine around what support was needed to counter Russia’s invasion, Mr Marles said when asked about such an agreement.\nAustralia’s intent and reliability had been completely clear and this wouldn’t be the last aid package for Ukraine, he said.\n“The conversations that we’ve been having with Ukraine, really the focus has been on providing the support, the particular support that Ukraine has been seeking, and obviously at a scale which is meaningful to them,” he told ABC Radio.\n“They know we are there for the long term … and we’ll continue to engage with them on that basis.”\nMr Marles met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy alongside other leaders from the so-called Indo-Pacific four nations on the sideline of the summit.\nIn addition to the new missiles Australia will supply artillery, mortar, cannon and small arms ammunition as well as a shipment of boots.\nAustralia will also join NATO’s new security and training initiative for Ukraine as a non-member partner, enabling defence personnel to contribute to planning and NATO-led military activity.\nA small number of people who are already working in Europe will transfer to the NATO initiative in the first instance, Mr Marles said.\n Defence Minister Richard Marles says the latest Ukraine assistance package will not be the last. Image by Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS The defence minister also signed a memorandum of understanding on the drone coalition for Ukraine while in Washington.\nThe US also announced further air defence aid for Ukraine, with former Ukrainian defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk saying the recent barrage of Russian rockets showed they “learned how to overwhelm existing systems”.\nNATO nations also needed to work on a plan to end the war rather than prop up Ukraine’s defence, so it does not continue to drag on, he said.\nOpposition foreign spokesman Simon Birmingham welcomed the latest round of military aid, saying Ukraine’s fight was “a test of the willingness of leading democracies to stand firm against aggression”.\n“Additional Australian support for Ukraine is welcome, especially the provision of missiles and weapons so clearly needed to defeat Russia,” he said on social media platform X.",

    "title": "'We might have an Ireland manager there' - Brady tips Duff in top job",
    "text": "'We might have an Ireland manager there' — Brady tips Duff in top job\nLiam Brady has tipped his fellow Ireland legend Damien Duff to manage the national team one day.\nAlthough Brady believes Heimir Hallgrímsson has a chance of leading Ireland into the playoffs for next year’s World Cup, Duff is one he can foresee taking the reins.\nBrady worked with Duff when he was assistant to Giovanni Trapattoni, the trio part of the Ireland unit that pushed France in the playoff for the 2010 World Cup.\nFor someone who seems so averse to managing in his playing career, Duff has revelled in the migration, guiding Shelbourne to their first title in 18 years in only his third season as a senior boss.\nChampions League exposure awaits the 46-year-old in the summer and former Arsenal playmaker Brady has been observing his burgeoning managerial career thrive from afar.\n“Damien was always serious about his football, a very good trainer,” Brady recalls over their two years together in the Ireland camp.\n“I can see he’s a hard task master with his players. He demanded that of himself really. We might have an Ireland manager there for the future.\n“I think Damien’s learning now. He’s going to learn in the Champions League too, that's another string to his bow.” Ireland head into the June friendlies against Senegal and Luxembourg having preserved their place in the second tier of next year’s Uefa Nations League.\nA couple of 2-1 victories over Bulgaria in March brought encouragement to Brady about the qualifiers beginning in September.\nIreland take on Portugal, Hungary and Armenia, with 72-times capped Brady fancying their prospects of being in the mix to reach the showpiece next year co-hosted by USA, Canada and Mexico.\nHallgrímsson led Iceland to the 2016 Euros and 2018 World Cup as well as Jamaica to the African Cup of Nations last summer.\n“I saw green shoots against Bulgaria, if you excuse the pun,” he noted. “There is a bit more confidence about the team. Winning helps confidence, helps belief. I think the manager is going about it the right way, the World Cup is not undoable.\nIf you think we can beat Bulgaria over two legs home and away, we might be able to finish second to Portugal. That was the way back in my day with Jack. When we qualified, we finished second, now you go to the playoff. I think there is something there, I’m pleased to say after a few barren years.\n“Stephen Kenny has to be given credit for giving all these kids early debuts and exposure to international football. And this new guy might pick up the pay-off from that. A lot of the kids have played over 20 games now. His track record is very good.”\nBrady enlisted several Irish cadets during his time leading Arsenal’s academy but the landscape has shifted since 2021 when Brexit raises the age for emigrants to 18. He’s pleased that St Patrick’s Athletic have pocketed €1.5m from the Gunners’ North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur for Mason Melia, who heads to Spurs at the end of the season.\n“Clubs are going to do that if they have a special player like that,” he stated. “I just hope the money goes back in, clubs realise that this is what we can do if we have good players and we coach them well.\n“Players in those two years between 16 and 18 need to get good coaching, competitive matches are play in good facilities. My guess is they’re probably not.\n“But I suppose his (Melia’s) profile came about because he was playing with the first team.”",

    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.
