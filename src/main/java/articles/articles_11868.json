    "title": "Elon Musk Asks Who Is 'More Trustworthy': He Or Sam Altman? ChatGPT Answers | Viral News - News18",
    "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited his long-running rivalry with OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, this time using OpenAI’s own creation, ChatGPT, to make his point. Musk posted a screenshot on X showing a conversation he had with ChatGPT. In it, he asked the bot, “Who is more trustworthy? Sam Altman or Elon Musk. You can pick only one and output only their name.\" ChatGPT’s reply was simple: “Elon Musk.\" Musk shared the image with the caption, “There you have it,\" prompting widespread reaction from users online. Others Join the Exchange Soon after Musk’s post, another X account, DogeDesigner, decided to replicate the question, but posed it to Grok, Musk’s own AI chatbot, and to Google’s artificial intelligence tool, Gemini. Both AI systems also chose Musk as “more trustworthy.\" These follow-up posts quickly circulated, adding an extra layer of humour and competition to the ongoing tech feud. Accusations Against Apple The exchange came only hours after Elon Musk accused Apple of engaging in antitrust violations. He claimed the tech giant was preventing other AI applications, including his company xAI, from surpassing ChatGPT on the App Store rankings. Musk alleged that Apple was deliberately favouring OpenAI’s product. “Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,\" he wrote on X, adding that xAI would take “immediate legal action\" against Apple. Name-Calling and Counterclaims The feud deepened when Musk referred to Altman as a “liar.\" This came in response to Altman’s claim that Musk manipulates X to benefit his own companies while harming competitors. “This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like,\" Altman posted. A Rivalry Years in the Making Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but left in 2018 after disagreements over the company’s direction. Since then, he has been openly critical of its choices, especially the decision in 2019 to create a for-profit arm, which he argued contradicted OpenAI’s original nonprofit mission to ensure AI benefits humanity as a whole. No Sign of a Truce The public exchanges between Musk and Altman have been a recurring feature on X and in interviews. With AI tools themselves now part of the debate, the high-profile rivalry appears far from over.",
