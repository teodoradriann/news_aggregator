It’s unconscionable.”Read Trump ally accused of being a Nazi after he changed the price of his pillowsShe added that Sinwar’s killing provided an opportunity to end the war, return the hostages and “bring relief to the Palestinian people, and work toward a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians in equal measure have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self-determination, and the safety they so rightly deserve.”When CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked about citizens who may refuse to vote for her because of the Biden Administration’s support for Israel, Harris responded by expressing sympathy for anti-Israel sentiments.“Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don’t know anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened, much less those who have relatives who have died and been killed,” she said.Read Kamala loses the JewsWhen Cooper asked Harris if she would be more pro-Israel than Donald Trump and she dodged the question and instead focused on her opponent’s alleged affinity for authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and compared him to Adolf Hitler.“I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous,” Harris said. “And if the president of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, why can’t you be more like Hitler’s generals? This is a serious, serious issue, and we know who he is.” 2024 electionDonald TrumpIsrael supportKamala Harris",

    "text": "Lights, laughter and lifts – Dancing With The Stars returned with a burst of sequins on Sunday night.\nThe RTE One show – hosted by Doireann Garrihy and Jennifer Zamparelli – welcomed 11 nervous celebrities to the dance floor as the show kicked off the new year.\nFormer Dancing With The Stars contestants Ellen Keane and Suzanne Jackson were spotted in the crowds as the class of 2024 got off to a showstopping start with their pink-filled opening number where they danced alongside their pro dance partners, judges Brian Redmond, Loraine Barry and Arthur Gourounlian.\nUp first to dance was Virgin Media star Katja Mia and her pro dance partner Ervinas Merfeldas took on “celebrity killer” the samba to the song My Love by Leigh-Anne featuring Ayra Starr.\nLoraine said: “Opening the show, the song, the vibes are oozing out of you. You are so samba tonight. You really need the hip action and you were rotating those hips.\n“You smashed the samba tonight,” she said. Arthur said: “You performed the celebrity killer, which is samba and guess what? You killed it.\n“You raised the bar so high.” And Brian said Katja had some of the “most natural body rhythm” he had ever seen over the years. The couple scored 21 points – a strong start to the show.\nChampion jockey Davy Russell took the reins with his pro dance partner Kylee Vincent and danced the Paso Doble to Crazy Horses by The Osmonds. But Arthur said he felt like Davy was “walking to the shops”.\nBrian said Davy had some “pretty big riding boots to fill” after Nina Carberry made it to the final on last year’s show. But he praised Davy’s debut on the show, saying he did better than Nina’s debut.\nLoraine said she was “impressed” with Davy’s core strength and his “masculinity”. Speaking afterwards, Davy said: “Nothing can compare you for this.” The pair scored 19 points on Sunday night’s show.\nNext up, presenter and broadcaster Laura Fox showed her rhythm as she danced a Jive with her partner Denys Samson to River Deep, Mountain High from the Glee Cast.\nBrian said the way Laura uses her arms is “so natural and so instinctive” but said she had work to do with her legs, which is out of sync with her dance partner Denys.\nBut Loraine praised her dance calling it a “fun, fab, jive”. Arthur said it was a “sassy, energetic jive”. The couple scored 21 points.\nFair City actor Shane Quigley Murphy, who is partnered with Laura Nolan, took the salsa to the studio as they danced to Where Did You Go? by Jax Jones & MNEK.\nLoraine said: “It’s a wowsers. It’s like go big or go home. It’s huge. What is in the water tonight because this is amazing.” Arthur said Shane had rhythm in his hips, with the dance suiting him. And Brian added Laura and Shane’s lifts were “exceptional”.\nFormer RTE Nine O’Clock newsreader Eileen Dunne – who retired last year after 42 years working at the station – showed there was no time to slow down as she and her pro dance partner Robert Rowiński danced an elegant American Smooth to I Am Woman by Peggy Lee.\nBut despite their gracious moves around the dance floor, they failed to impress the judges scoring 14 points, the second lowest points of the night.\nParalympian Jason Smyth and his pro partner Karen Byrne took to the floor and performed a Foxtrot to They Can’t Take That Away from Me by Frank Sinatra & Natalie Cole.\nArthur said his competitiveness, rhythm and determination will help him in the competition. Speaking after his dance, Jason said he was doing it for his kids. The couple scored 17 points.\nParalympian Champion Jason Smyth with his Partner Karen Byrne during Dancing with the Stars week one\nDrag star Blu Hydrangea and their partner Simone Arena were the seventh couple to dance tonight. You’re Free by Icona Pop & Ulta Naté was the soundtrack for their Cha Cha.\nLoraine described it as “sassy, sexy and so much fun” and thanked the pair for a “textbook cha-cha-cha”, while Brian and Arthur also praised their dance. The pair scored 24 points, the highest score of the night.\nFormer Miss World Rosanna Davison and her pro partner Stephen Vincent were the next couple to perform. Their Waltz was danced to Come Away with Me by Norah Jones, which impressed the judges.\nArthur said the dance was “so dreamy and so graceful” but he urged her to relax on the dance floor. Brian said: “I was very impressed with how you moved across the dance floor. Not a bad waltz.” The pair scored 17 points.\nWild Youth singer David Whelan is paired with Salome Chacua and danced a Tango to Bad Habits by Ed Sheeran feat. Bring Me the Horizon. Brian said Whelan was “one to watch”.\nLoraine said: “It was drama and intensity and you both had that”, saying “it was excellent”. The pair scored 23 points.\nWild Youth Frontman David Whelan with his Partner Salome Chachua during Dancing with the Stars\nTikTok star Miriam Mullins is partnered with new professional dancer Montel Hewson they took to the dancefloor with a Quickstep to Fascination by Alphabeat.\nLoraine said Miriam “moved really well around the floor” but urged the social media influencer to focus on her posture. Arthur said she had a “fire in her belly”, while Brian added that Miriam’s springing had “more springs than a mattress factory”. The couple scored 18 points.\nThe final couple to dance were actor Rory Cowan and new dancer Jillian Bromwich. They danced a Charleston to When I’m Sixty-Four by Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers.\nThe 64-year-old added his comedic charm to the dance, saying he “loved every minute of it.” Arthur: “They say they saved the best for last but I’m not sure but it was fun though”, saying he has musicality and should push himself harder.\nRory added: “You can dance good or you can dance bad. Doesn’t matter as long as you dance.” Loraine said Rory has “rhythm and agility” and encouraged him to keep dancing.\nAsked by host Doireann Garrihy if Mrs Brown would’ve approved, Rory said: “She would’ve loved it”, saying he plans to retire and go out with a bang by taking part in the biggest show in the country. The couple scored 11 points, the lowest score of the night.\nThe glitz, glamour, and nail-biting competition will all unfold as the series continues on RTÉ One and RTÉ Player next Sunday, January 14 at 6:30pm.",

Revisa también: El fatal incidente ocurrió cuando un árbol de más de 20 metros cayó sobre el techo del vehículo en el que estaba. Todo esto debido al violento sistema frontal que azota la zona central, que irrumpió con ráfagas de vientos que causaron varios cortes de energía eléctrica. El capitán Jorge Salazar, de la Prefectura Central Metropolitana de Carabineros, informó que personal policial se dirigió a la intersección de Av. Gladys Marín con Las Torres para verificar un accidente donde una palmera había caído sobre un automóvil. Al llegar al lugar, confirmaron que había una persona fallecida en el interior del vehículo. “Es producto del frente de mal tiempo y por los vientos, es que cae una de estas palmeras encima del vehículo”, cerró. El copiloto falleció en el lugar, mientras que sus acompañantes, dos hombres adultos, lograron escapar con vida. Las dos personas lesionadas fueron trasladadas al SAMU de la posta central, donde esperan los resultados de sus evaluaciones médicas. El capitán Salazar explicó que la caída de la palmera fue causada por los fuertes vientos del temporal.

    "title": "Ottawa teen raced in socks to get help for friends who fell through ice: 911 caller",
    "text": "OTTAWA — It was about 9:30 p.m. when a young man came racing to her yard in his socks, a T-shirt and shorts. No coat. No phone. Dripping wet.\n\"He was yelling he needed help because his friend had fallen through the ice,\" says Carly Roome.\nShe called the police right away, and she and her parents spoke with the boy, who was \"really shaken up,\" to get more details as she spoke to the 911 operator.\nThe boy had pulled his sister out of the Rideau River, about 400 metres away from where Roome lives. But he was worried about those he was unable to save.\nThe family drove the teenager back to the site, where his sister was waiting, and Roome passed her phone over to the teenager so he could provide more details about what happened.\n\"The sister was just, like, yelling, and just, like, really freaked out,\" Roome said.\n\"So I just held her while he was on the phone.\"\nPolice confirmed Thursday morning that one teenager was dead. Another was still missing.\nPolice said Thursday that emergency crews responded to a call about four teens falling into the river from Nicolls Island Road at 9:45 p.m. Police reported earlier that the first call came in at roughly 11:45 p.m., but later clarified that was a mistake.\nThey said two of the teenagers were immediately rescued from the water and were taken to hospital by paramedics, while a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old boy were still missing and believed to be in the water.\nPolice said a rescue operation took place in \"very difficult conditions,\" and included a surface and water search. Divers recovered the body of one of the missing teenagers.\nThe search for the second missing teen was paused overnight and did not resume in the morning. Just before 3 p.m. on Thursday, an underwater search and recovery unit arrived on the scene and set up a tent near the edge of the river.\nAsked why the police press release implied that two teens were rescued when Roome's account suggests that one rescued himself and his sister, a police spokesperson noted that the release did not specify how the youths were rescued.\n\"I really feel for the boy that came to our house. He saved his sister and tried to save his friend,\" said Roome.\n\"And then in like no clothes ran to our house to get more help for his friend. I just really think he did everything that he could.\"\nThree marked police vehicles had been parked near the Long Island Locks of the Rideau Canal on a rainy Thursday morning, as milder-than-average temperatures persisted in Ottawa.\nYellow police tape was wrapped around the locks near the river, where a thin layer of ice appeared to extend outward from the shore, met by open water.\nPolice also taped off an area near the shoreline.\nNearby, a black SUV was parked and blocked off with tape. The licence plates on the front and back of the vehicle were covered.\nAsked for more details, the police spokesperson said more information was not being shared because it remains an ongoing police operation.\n\"We have offered supports to the loved ones of the youths,\" an earlier police statement read. \"This tragedy affects us all.\"\nThe search for the missing teen comes amid a spate of similar incidents across the country.\nRCMP in Alberta confirmed this week that a family of three died after falling through thin ice while riding their UTV in the lead-up to Christmas.\nThe Mounties also said a man died after falling through ice near Calgary on Christmas Day.\nLast month, the RCMP in Saskatchewan reported that two girls fell through ice on a lake. One of them died, along with two men who were attempting a rescue.\nAnd in Quebec this week, provincial police said the search for a four-year-old girl who fell into a river last week is now being considered a recovery operation rather than a rescue mission.\nAfter the Prairies deaths, Mounties were reminding outdoor enthusiasts that ice should be at least 15 centimetres thick for a person to walk or skate on it.\nThe thickness should be at least 20 centimetres for a group of people and 25 centimetres for the use of a snowmobile or off-road vehicle.\nAsked on Thursday whether Ottawa police had any message to the public about safety around ice, the spokesperson said the service's website points to advice from the Canadian Red Cross.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\n— With files from Maan Alhmidi in Toronto.\nStephanie Taylor, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — Justin Trudeau has “full confidence” in his long-time political lieutenant, Chrystia Freeland, the prime minister said Thursday, in response to a report that senior advisers in the Liberal government are concerned about her performance as finance minister.\nThe Prime Minister’s Office said the story published Thursday in the Globe and Mail contains assertions that are “not accurate.”\n×\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts Asked about the story on the final day of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington, Trudeau did not deny its accuracy, but said he has faith in Freeland “as a close friend and ally and partner” in his government. He noted that as finance minister, she has overseen the “most ambitious housing program in Canadian history, along with the $35-billion scheme to deliver more affordable child care across the country.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “These are all things that Chrystia has led on and will continue to do,” Trudeau said.\n“I have full confidence in her abilities and on the work we’re going to be doing together.”\nTrudeau also acknowledged, as first reported in the Star , that he has had discussions with former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, in which they spoke about Carney joining the government as finance minister.\nTrudeau did not deny he had met with Carney, saying only that he has “been talking with Mark Carney for years now about getting him to join federal politics.\n“I think he would be an outstanding addition at the time when Canadians need good people to step up in politics,” Trudeau said.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Freeland was appointed finance minister in 2020 after the resignation of her predecessor, Bill Morneau, as the Liberal government was unleashing a massive surge in spending to prop up the economy and support Canadians during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. She also serves as deputy prime minister.\nTrudeau made his comments Thursday after the Globe and Mail reported that said senior officials in his office — including his long-serving chief of staff, Katie Telford — believe Freeland has been “ineffective” in showcasing the government’s economic plan as national polls show the Liberals have fallen far behind Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative party in public support.\n“These assertions are not accurate,” the Prime Minister’s Office’s statement said. “The Deputy Prime Minister has been working tirelessly and effectively to serve Canadians since she was first appointed to cabinet in 2015.”\nA spokesperson for Freeland did not respond to a request for comment.\nTrudeau has recently come under pressure over his party’s poor standing in the polls. After the Liberals lost a June 24 byelection to the Conservatives in the long-safe riding of Toronto—St. Paul’s, Trudeau and his team were swamped by a wave of calls for him to resign.\nSeveral veteran Liberals, including Trudeau’s former environment minister, said he should step down for the good of the party, but only one sitting member of his caucus — New Brunswick’s Wayne Long — publicly declared that he wanted Trudeau to go.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Several Liberal MPs have told the Star that the byelection loss triggered serious concerns about their party’s trajectory heading toward the next federal election campaign. Some, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said that Trudeau should resign or acknowledge that some caucus members share that view, while others went on the record to express their support for the prime minister.\nStill more have told the Star that Trudeau needs to make significant changes, possibly to his cabinet or to top staff in the Liberal party organization. Trudeau was pushed to make changes in a call with regional caucus leaders, two sources with knowledge of the conversation told the Star last week.\nTrudeau has long insisted he intends to remain as Liberal leader heading into the next election, which is currently scheduled for October 2025.\nWhile pressure over his future ramped up, some have suggested alternatives for the job. Catherine McKenna, who was in Trudeau’s cabinet for six years, has expressed support for Carney . Wayne Easter, a former long-time MP and cabinet minister who was in Trudeau’s caucus until 2021, named Carney, Housing Minister Sean Fraser and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne as candidates he would like to see in a leadership race.\nFreeland would also be interested in joining the contest when the time comes, a senior government official told the Star earlier this year .\nNone of them has confirmed an intention to run if Trudeau steps down.\nAlex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering federal politics for the Star.
