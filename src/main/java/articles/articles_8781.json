    "text": " Maxwell helps Stars rain supreme against Hurricanes Read full article Martin Pegan 29 December 2023 at 12:20 am · 2-min read Jono Searle/AAP PHOTOS\nThe Melbourne Stars have continued their BBL resurgence, with captain Glenn Maxwell leading the side to a second consecutive victory in a rain-affected clash with the Hobart Hurricanes.\nThe Stars restricted the Hurricanes to 155 before wet and wild conditions blanketed Blundstone Arena during the innings break and reduced the target to 67 runs from seven overs under the DLS.\nMaxwell started the chase with Sam Harper but was stranded at the bowler's end as Hurricanes quick Riley Meredith (2-15) sparked the hosts with two wickets in the opening over on Thursday night.\nMeredith sent the first ball of the Stars' innings down the legside for a wide, but then had Harper out hooking off the next delivery.\nMarcus Stoinis was out three balls later in much the same way, and when Canes captain Nathan Ellis bowled Hilton Cartwright in the next over the Stars were reeling at 3-6.\nBut Maxwell (35 not out) and Thomas Rogers (21 not out) steered the Stars (2-3) home to make it back-to-back victories after a slow start to their Big Bash League campaign.\nMaxwell (3-29) had earlier taken three middle-order wickets to help restrict the Hurricanes to a modest total.\n\"I took a gamble to bring myself on,\" Maxwell told Fox Sports.\n\"With that little bit of drizzle and that rain it actually changed the pitch, I was able to get the ball to skid on a bit faster.\n\"You get a couple of lucky wickets with just timing.\"\nPakistan pacer Haris Rauf (3-24) chipped in with three scalps late in the innings as the Canes were bowled out with two balls remaining after a bright start.\nMac Wright (33) set the pace early for the Hurricanes until mistiming a waist-high full toss off Usama Mir to Stoinis diving low at deep midwicket.\nCaleb Jewell (45) maintained the momentum for the Hurricanes and smashed three consecutive boundaries off Beau Webster in the ninth over.\nThe Hurricanes opener sent a scare through the Stars' camp with a sharp straight drive off Maxwell that left the Australia international needing attention after getting a hand on the ball to prevent a certain boundary.\nStory continues The offspinner responded with the next delivery, darting a straight ball into Jewell's pads to trap him lbw for 45 off 37 balls and spark a middle-order collapse.\nNikhil Chaudhary looked set to rescue the hosts with positive play as he took 10 runs off two balls from Rauf.\nBut the Stars' quick responded by taking pace off the ball as Chaudhary swung hard again but was caught in the deep for 32 off 16 balls before the rain arrived.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "Indore, Jul 19 (PTI) Indore Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava on Friday said the world record of planting 11 lakh saplings in a single day could be achieved by the city through public participation as well as with the active support of the Border Security Force (BSF).\nOn July 14, Indore set a new Guinness World Record in the category of \"the most trees planted by a team in 24 hours\" by planting more than 11 lakh saplings.\nTalking to PTI, Bhargava said, \"On June 6, when I received a call from Urban Development Minister and former mayor Kailash Vijayvargiya, about planting 51 lakh saplings in a single day in Indore, I welcomed the idea. We discussed that it will be more practical if we plan to plant these many trees over a period of seven days.\"\nIt was also decided that Indore will beat Assam's record by planting 11 lakh saplings a single day in the presence of the team of the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\"The biggest challenge was to identify a place where at least 11 lakh saplings could be planted in a single day on July 14 for the world record. After a thorough search of the surroundings, we chose Revati Hill, half of which is with the BSF, while the rest belongs to the revenue department. We talked to the BSF officials and they not only agreed for plantation but also assured maximum participation from their side,\" Bhargava said.\n\"We divided the entire hill into nine zones and those were divided into 100 sub-zones. Two ponds were made on the hill for sustaining these plants in the summer season and 3,000 workers and volunteers were deployed in the area on July 14,\" he added.\nOf the 11 lakh saplings, the BSF personnel planted 3 lakh saplings, forest and civic body teams planted 1 lakh plants while social groups planted 7 lakh saplings, he said,\n\"The target was achieved without any chaos or mismanagement,\" the mayor said, adding that a total of 51 lakh saplings were planted during the week-long drive.\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated Indore on setting the world record. He also participated in the 'Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam' campaign and planted a sapling in Indore on that day.\nAccording to the Guinness World Record website, the previous record for the most saplings planted in 24 hours was 9,21,730. It was achieved by the Assam government's Forest Department at Udalguri in September 2023.",

    "text": "Significant Growth in Acute Ischemic Stroke Market Ahead [Dylan Bailey](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=78709)Updated: 10-17-2024 07:24 PM Acute Ischemic Stroke Therapeutics Market Overview The global market for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) therapeutics is set to undergo a substantial transformation, projected to expand by USD 1.74 billion from 2024 to 2028. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the integration of advanced artificial intelligence solutions in the healthcare sector. Rising Demand and Market Estimate The AIS therapeutics market is anticipated to exhibit a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1% during the forecast period. This surge is propelled by the heightened incidence of conditions like atherosclerosis which often leads to blockages in cerebral blood vessels. As a result, the demand for innovative therapeutic interventions grows, particularly those that incorporate AI technologies.' Importance of AI in Market Trends Artificial intelligence is playing a significant role in reshaping healthcare, including the AIS therapeutics market. By employing AI-driven analytics, healthcare providers are capable of analyzing vast amounts of data to customize treatment plans based on individual patient genetics as well as clinical histories. This personalized care enhances patient outcomes and propels the market forward. Key Market Drivers The necessity for effective treatment strategies is underscored by the increasing occurrences of AIS. This medical condition frequently results from a variety of risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, contributing to its rising prevalence. Several therapeutic agents like thrombolytics and anticoagulants are essential in the treatment of AIS. Surgical Procedures and Innovations Advancements in surgical interventions also bolster market growth. Procedures such as Mechanical Thrombectomy operate on the premise of physically removing blockages, allowing for improved blood flow to the brain. Innovative equipment, including Carotid Endarterectomy and automated thrombectomy devices, are critical in addressing the challenges associated with AIS. Challenges Faced by the Market While the market is experiencing growth, it is not without its challenges. A significant hurdle is the limited availability of antidotes for reversing anticoagulants. The ongoing need for effective anticoagulant reversal agents is crucial to maximize the efficacy of currently employed therapies. The Role of Modern Drug Classes Various drug classes in AIS treatment, such as statins and antihypertensives, significantly contribute to patient care. These medications are often delivered through intravenous or oral routes, and their effectiveness is enhanced with supportive technologies like neuroimaging to guide clinical decisions. Market Segmentation Insights The AIS therapeutics market can be segmented into multiple categories, notably by type and route of distribution. This segmentation allows stakeholders to understand market dynamics better and develop targeted strategies. Key therapeutic areas include thrombolytics, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents, each with defined roles in stroke management. Future of the AIS Therapeutics Market Given the increasing focus on technological integration and data-driven healthcare solutions, the future of the AIS market looks promising. Companies are investing in research and development to introduce innovative products and solutions that address unmet needs in AIS treatment.
