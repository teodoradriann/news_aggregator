(Photo: Michelle Banda) By Michelle Banda\nFollow\nFollowing 18 Jul 2024\nFollow\nFollowing\n1 Thousands of people participated in Jozi My Jozi’s clean-up in Hillbrow on Mandela Day. By linking volunteers to worthy causes, Jozi My Jozi wants to develop a spirit of service year-round and rejuvenate Johannesburg’s inner city. For Mandela Day on Thursday , nonprofit organisation Jozi My Jozi, in collaboration with corporates, NGOs, the Gauteng government and the City of Johannesburg, hosted a clean-up in the inner city’s notorious Hillbrow district, with around 4,500 people coming out to help.\nJozi My Jozi aims to recruit people to help improve Johannesburg’s grimy inner city. CEO Bea Swanepoel said the event wasn’t a once-off.\nAt least 4,500 participants from the private and public sectors came to help in the Hillbrow clean-up. (Photo: Michelle Banda)\n“It was a collaboration of the private and public sectors to also test out theories of what works and what doesn’t in the worst areas that we can find. We choose Hillbrow for that very reason,” she said.\n“It needs tender love and care and no one is willing to go into Hillbrow because of an existing bad reputation and people’s perception of it. So we needed people to see for themselves the truth about Hillbrow.”\nJozi My Jozi’s Adopt a Project programme links volunteers to various inner city initiatives, which helps to make every day a Mandela Day and demonstrates a deep commitment to making a positive impact on the city and its residents, said Swanepoel.\nRead more: Jozi My Jozi poised as the catalyst for Joburg’s ‘phoenix moment’ of inner-city renewal\n“If we say we are going to work together under the government of national unity, what better day to choose than Mandela Day to collaborate? This event was a connection of the private and the public for the betterment of the people who live in the City of Johannesburg.\n“For us, Nelson Mandela Day is 365 days. Jozi My Jozi is involved in various projects every day and this event was to create awareness, but one day is not enough or sustainable,” she said.\nSafety key Wayne Dawson, Jozi My Jozi’s safety and security lead, told Daily Maverick that helping make Johannesburg safer was a top priority for the group.\nJohannesburg has been ranked as the 13th riskiest city for tourists in the world, according to a recent survey by Longwoods International that was published in Forbes Advisor . It also ranked third among the 10 African cities with the highest crime index at the start of 2024 .\nDawson said they were bringing SAPS, metro police, crime wardens and security companies together to create a collective force to ensure that Johannesburg residents were safe, anywhere, at all times.\nHe said this would be coupled with solar-powered surveillance cameras, street lights and intelligence equipment to ensure they were not affected by load shedding.\n“What we aim to achieve is a clean and safe city for all during the day and at night. We want Joburg to be a 24-hour city… to get her vibe back and bring back people and investments. All we need is the community on our side. We have the confidence to do what we are promising with passion and pride.”\nDawson said, however, there needed to be a united strategy.\n“Every department has a vision and strategy of how they want things to work, which is a stumbling block because they ringfence certain things and then there is a conflict with other departments or whoever wants to help. What is also needed is a new look at enforcement – it’s not working now. It’s about bringing back specialisation,” said Dawson.\nIn another Mandela Day event, Miss SA Natasha Joubert visited Mveledzandivho Primary School in Soweto. Joubert, alongside Anglo-Gold Ashanti, has pledged to help the Adopt-a-School Foundation primary school to reach the best educational outcomes.

Let us reclaim the City of Gold.”\nMoses Mangwanye said: “Days like these remind us of what we can achieve if we stand together.”\nJozi My Jozi will organise another clean-up in August before the rugby Test match between the Springboks and the All Blacks at Ellis Park.

    "title": "'Party atmosphere': Skygazers treated to another aurora show",
    "text": "For at least the second time this year, skygazers in many parts of the world were treated to colourful auroras at latitudes beyond the polar extremes where they normally light up the skies. cientist Jim Wild has travelled to the Arctic Circle numerous times to study the northern lights, but on Thursday night he only needed to look out of his bedroom window in the English city of Lancaster. For at least the second time this year, skygazers in many parts of the world were treated to colourful auroras at latitudes beyond the polar extremes where they normally light up the skies. The dazzling celestial shows were caused by a gigantic ball of plasma, and an accompanying magnetic field, which erupted from the Sun earlier this week. When this eruption, called a coronal mass ejection (CME), arrived at Earth at around 4 p.m. GMT on Thursday, it triggered a strong geomagnetic storm. This storm in turn sparked northern and southern lights, aurora borealis and aurora australis, in swathes of Europe, the United States, Australia and elsewhere. While Wild could see the shimmering reds and greens from his back garden, he jumped in the car with his family to get a better look away from the bright lights of Lancaster. \"All the little back roads and parking spots were full of people with flasks of coffee and deck chairs looking at the northern lights,\" he told AFP. \"It was a party atmosphere,\" he said, comparing the scenes to UFO spotters looking up at the sky in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. While Wild was explaining the phenomenon to his 11- and 13-year-old children, another nearby skygazer approached and asked how come he knew so much about it. \"Well, actually, this is what I study for a living,\" responded the professor in space physics at Lancaster University, who specializes in how solar weather disrupts power grids and transport here on Earth. 'Perfect hit' Auroras were also visible across northern Europe, including near London and Berlin, and as far south in the US as the state of Virginia. In the Southern Hemisphere, areas of Australia and New Zealand were also treated to a show, AFP photos showed. The CME that triggered Thursday's auroras erupted from a spot on the Sun pointed directly at Earth, said Juha-Pekka Luntama, the head of the European Space Agency's Space Weather Office. \"It was a perfect hit.\" The CME caused a \"severe\" geomagnetic storm given a rating of G4. This fell narrowly short of the highest level of G5, which was seen in May, when auroras delighted many skygazers across swathes of the world. Storms on the Sun have been intensifying as solar activity approaches, or may have already reached, the peak of its 11-year cycle. While such storms offer pretty light shows for skygazers, they can pose a serious threat to satellites, GPS services, power grids and even astronauts in space. The US Space Weather Prediction Center warned on Thursday that the geomagnetic storm could disrupt emergencies services already stretched thin by deadly hurricanes Helene and Milton. Luntama said the European Space Agency had not received any information about disruptions caused by the latest storm, but sometimes this can take days. The storm is \"gradually dissipating\", he added, which means that any auroras on Friday night or over the weekend will likely be farther north in Europe, such as central Sweden. But for those still hoping to see an aurora, there could be some more chances in the next couple of years. Luntama explained that during past solar cycles, the biggest eruptions have come in the two years after the Sun passed its peak. Wild also did not expect a repeat of Thursday's \"magical\" display. But space weather, like Earth's weather, is not an \"exact art,\" he emphasised. And if there is an aurora lighting up the sky nearby, it is worth seeking out. Wild said his neighbours had travelled to Norway twice to see the northern lights, but had been foiled by clouds both times. Then on Thursday night, they saw an aurora from their garden. \"They were really delighted to finally have seen it,\" Wild said.
