    "text": "Danny Masterson, de ‘That 70’s Show’, vai para a cadeia cumprir pena por estupros Em setembro, Danny foi condenado pelo estupro de duas mulheres cerca de 20 anos atrás Folhapress São Paulo – SP Conhecido por seu trabalho em “That ’70s Show”, o ator Danny Masterson, 47, foi admitido na Prisão Estadual de North Kern em Delano na quarta-feira (27), onde deverá começar a cumprir sua pena de 30 anos por estupros cometidos. A primeira foto dele vestindo o uniforme da cadeia foi divulgada pelo Departamento de Correções e Reabilitação da Califórnia. Segundo a agência, ele passa por um processo de classificação e recepção que pode levar 90 dias. Segundo a ABC News, Masterson cumprirá duas sentenças de 15 anos consecutivas, uma para cada acusação. Em setembro, Danny foi condenado pelo estupro de duas mulheres cerca de 20 anos atrás. A sentença foi anunciada por uma juíza do tribunal de Los Angeles, nos Estados Unidos. As vítimas afirmaram que Masterson as teria drogado e as estuprado em incidentes separados, entre 2001 e 2003, em sua casa em Hollywood. O ator já havia sido condenado em junho pelos dois estupros em um segundo julgamento. O primeiro, em novembro do ano passado, foi anulado, porque outro júri não havia conseguido chegar a uma decisão unânime. Masterson ganhou fama com a estreia, em 1998, de “That ’70s Show”, na qual interpretava Steven Hyde e dividia a tela com Mila Kunis e Ashton Kutcher. Voltou a trabalhar com Kutcher em “The Ranch”, da Netflix, mas foi demitido em 2017, quando foi acusado pela primeira vez de agredir sexualmente várias mulheres. Seu personagem foi eliminado da trama. Você pode gostar JBr SHOPPING Use o código \"JBR\" e ganhe 10% de desconto",

    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - With no-excuse in-person absentee voting underway across Missouri, make sure you know who is collecting your information. A western Missouri county clerk reported to the secretary of state’s office that a voter showed up and was expected to dodge lines, claiming he had signed up online for an appointment to vote. There’s no such thing as a fast pass. “You can’t have reservations, like you would at a restaurant for voting,” said Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft. “Our clerks and election boards are taking everyone as they come. We don’t want people to think, oh, I signed up for an appointment, but we don’t do that. It’s whoever is there first we deal with.” The voter provided personal information, including home address, phone number, and email. Instead of third-party groups, always use trusted sources like county clerks, local election boards, and the Missouri Secretary of State’s office.

    "title": "BREAKING: Northwestern fires offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian - Inside NU",
    "text": "Although Northwestern had a winning record for the first time in three years, the Wildcats are still making notable changes. In his first major move as NU’s full-time head coach, David Braun has elected to fire offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian, Matt Fortuna reported Thursday afternoon. ESPN’s Sean McDonough also announced the move during Saturday’s Las Vegas Bowl. Sources: Northwestern has parted ways with OC Mike Bajakian, special teams coordinator/TEs coach Jeff Genyk and director of sports performance for football Jay Hooten.— Matt Fortuna (@Matt_Fortuna) [https://t.co/fxngM3l8wk] [December 28, 2023] Bajakian served as the Wildcats’ OC from 2020-23. His first year in Evanston was rather fruitful in taking over for Mick McCall, posting 24.7 points per game and leading NU to a 7-2 record with a Citrus Bowl win. However, things have soured considerably in the last three seasons — particularly from 2021-22, when the ‘Cats scored 15.16 points per game. There was marginal improvement with sixth-year quarterback Ben Bryant under center this season, but Northwestern’s 22.1 PPG is still 104th in the FBS. Other problematic areas have been rushing — in which NU ranks 119th at 101.4 yards per game — time of possession, in which NU is 101st — and penalties, where the ‘Cats have amassed 34 accepted blocking fouls in 11 games. Even when the Wildcats had bright moments, inconsistency ensued. NU posted 24 first-half points against Maryland, but mustered only three field goals in a lackluster second half. Likewise, Northwestern was the first team to score 24 points in the first 30 minutes in Wisconsin’s Camp Randall Stadium since 2008, but then was held scoreless — and well under 50 yards of offense — in the second half. On top of subpar offensive production, Bajakian generated strong negative reactions when he donned a [“Cats Against The World” shirt](https://x.com/Bradley_Locker/status/1689302682127769600?s=20) in support of former Northwestern football coach Pat Fitzgerald in the first open practice following Fitzgerald’s firing on Aug. 9. Such shirts were reprimanded by NU athletic director Derrick Gragg in a subsequent statement. Bajakian, 49, previously spent time as the OC at Boston College, Tennessee, Cincinnati and Central Michigan. He also served as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ quarterbacks coach from 2015-18.",

    "text": "So-called “atmospheric rivers” of moisture streaming inland from the Pacific Ocean last winter proved beneficial to on-the-ground rivers and reservoirs in Colorado and elsewhere in the West. In what also was a big year for water on the Western Slope, the Colorado River District and Xcel Energy in 2023 reached a historic deal for the sale of water rights for the Shoshone hydroelectric power plant in a bid to permanently protect Colorado River flows. A bounty of snowstorms last winter and spring produced a plentiful snowpack and a copious amount of snowmelt that coursed into streams and rivers and recharged reservoirs left parched by drier weather in previous years. The moisture originated in part from those “rivers” of condensed water in the atmosphere that also brought badly needed precipitation but also flooding to California. By later February, snowpacks accumulations in some parts of Colorado, including on the Grand Mesa, already were exceeding peak seasonal snowpack levels typically not reached until April. By early March the snowpack at Columbine Pass on the Uncompahgre Plateau was almost twice its normal amount for that time of year. Ultimately, all major basins on the Western Slope had well-above-normal snowpacks, with peaks accumulations for the season ranging from 125% of normal for the Colorado River headwaters basin to 175% of normal for the combined San Miguel/Dolores/Animas/San Juan river basins in southwest Colorado. The snowpack was substantial enough in far-northwest Colorado this past winter that it caused historic die-offs of big game, forcing Colorado Parks and Wildlife to cut back hunting licenses in that region. Deep and persistent snow, sometimes crusted over, made it hard for animals to reach buried forage, and animals congregated along highways in high numbers, resulting in vehicle strikes including one case in which a semi killed 35 pronghorn. But mostly the abundant snow spelled good news for the region. By the start of June the water level in Blue Mesa Reservoir west of Gunnison, which is the state’s largest water body and had experienced considerable drops in water levels in recent years, had reached 101% of normal for that time of year. As of Dec. 1 it was holding 595,200 acre-feet of water, 99% of normal for that date and more than twice the amount in the reservoir a year earlier. The rush of runoff into the Colorado River last year provided a badly needed boost to Lake Powell and Lake Mead, where water levels had plunged so low as to pose threats to hydropower production and further diminish supplies for water users that rely on storage from the Southwest’s two largest reservoirs. While last year’s moisture reduced the urgency of concerns about those reservoir levels a little, it would take multiple strong water years in a row to fully alleviate the problems with Powell and Mead, experts say. That doesn’t seem likely to happen given the overall long-term drought that has beset the Colorado River Basin during a century where warming temperatures also are exacerbating the situation. Given that context, officials from federal and state agencies, water utilities and other entities continue to look to longer-term solutions for managing Colorado River water use in a new era when it appears considerably less water will be available than historically had been the case. SHOSHONE DEAL Meanwhile, as this past year neared its end, the Colorado River District reached an agreement for what it hopes is a solution for preserving river flows associated with the Shoshone plant in Glenwood Canyon. In December it agreed to buy Xcel Energy’s Shoshone water rights for $98.5 million. Those water rights include a 1902 right to 1,250 cubic feet per second of water. That right, because of its seniority, controls flows on the Colorado River in western Colorado. Access to water in Colorado is based on the seniority of rights, with owners of junior rights cut off from water first when there isn’t enough to go around. The Shoshone right keeps water flowing into Glenwood Canyon that otherwise might be diverted upstream, and also keeps that water flowing downstream of the canyon, where it’s available for agricultural uses, improves the water quality for municipal water suppliers, and plays a crucial role in bolstering water levels in critical river habitat for imperiled fish in Mesa County. With the sale agreement reached, the river district is now focused on meeting conditions required to allow the sale to go forward. While it is pitching in $20 million to the sale, it is hoping to get $10 million from governments and other entities in western Colorado, $49 million from the Bureau of Reclamation and $20 million from the Colorado Water Conservation Board. It also needs to reach an agreement with the CWCB authorizing the CWCB to use the water for instream flow purposes when the plant isn’t operating, and needs along with the CWCB to try to obtain a change-of-water-right court decree for the instream flow use. Xcel also needs to obtain state Public Utilities Commission approvals for the sale. If the deal can be consummated in coming years, it could end decades of concern over what might happen to the historic flow rights associated with the plant if the plant ever is closed. “How does history feel? It feels pretty good today, doesn’t it?” state Rep. Marc Catlin, R-Montrose, also vice president of the river district board, said in a signing ceremony for the deal in Glenwood Springs.",

The economy saw a 3.4 percent increase in real output in 2023, driven by the recovery of key sectors such as tourism, export-oriented manufacturing in automobiles and aeronautics, and a rebound in private consumption. The report highlights Morocco’s impressive external performance, buoyed by booming Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) announcements that promise significant development opportunities. International confidence in Morocco is underscored by favorable country risk indicators, while the composition of Moroccan exports shows increasing complexity, largely due to a post-pandemic surge in capital-intensive industries. Macroeconomic policies supporting this growth include a robust public sector, which has expanded significantly post-pandemic to sustain aggregate demand amidst economic shocks. Successful fiscal management has reduced the budget deficit, although strategies like innovative financing operations are being used to manage the government’s real estate assets, albeit with potential future financial obligations. Bank Al-Maghrib’s cautious monetary policies have effectively managed inflation following recent price shocks, contributing to Morocco’s rapid disinflation process. However, despite overall economic growth, Moroccan businesses and households continue to struggle with challenges such as rising business insolvencies and a tepid labor market, which saw nearly 200 thousand job losses in rural areas in 2023. Per capita consumption has only marginally recovered to pre-pandemic levels, underscoring the lingering impact of recent economic shocks on welfare. The government’s new direct social aid program aims to alleviate pressure on poorer households. Looking ahead, Morocco’s economy is projected to moderate in 2024 with expected agricultural challenges leading to a 2.9 percent growth rate. A weak agricultural campaign is anticipated to contract agricultural value added by 3.3 percent due to adverse weather conditions. However, non-agricultural sectors are poised for resilience driven by domestic demand recovery and a robust industrial sector. Growth is forecasted to improve from 2025 onwards assuming normal agricultural conditions. The report includes a special focus on Morocco’s private sector dynamics, revealing lackluster productivity performance and challenges in allocative efficiency. Larger firms exhibit lower productivity compared to smaller counterparts, hindering the market’s ability to reward efficiency and innovation adequately. Moroccan SMEs struggle to scale up, and the density of High Growth Firms remains low, despite their potential to significantly contribute to job creation. Addressing these constraints within the private sector is crucial to enhancing Morocco’s job creation capacity and overcoming recent economic challenges.",

    "text": "Así lo determinó un estudio de la Universidad de Chicago. 7/11/2024 16:40 Periodista: Rubén Mcadam. ¿Alguna vez usted se ha preguntado cuántos años le gustaría vivir? Para algunos, la barrera de los 100 años parece lejana de alcanzar, aunque le vamos a dar un dato que lo puede sorprender: en Costa Rica, la esperanza de vida es de 83,3 años en mujeres y 78,4 en hombres, pero un estudio de la Universidad de Chicago, Estados Unidos, estima que, gracias a la inteligencia artificial (IA), podríamos aumentar nuestra esperanza de vida hasta los 150 años. Además, la empresa biotecnológica Singapur Gero complementó la investigación, demostrando que, con ayuda de la IA, se podrá alcanzar esa edad, por medio de la preservación de los tejidos y órganos. Pero también hay que explicar un tema: ¿vivir con calidad de vida o con cantidad de años? El decano de Medicina de la UCIMED, Pablo Vargas, nos explica la diferencia. “La esperanza de vida saludable es aquella donde la persona puede ser independiente, puede hacer sus compras, realizar ejercicios sin depender de asistencia; entonces, la esperanza de vida saludable es, por ejemplo, 65 años y luego hay 15 años donde la persona va a estar viva, pero va a requerir un apoyo, esa es la diferencia de la esperanza de vida normal y la esperanza de vida saludable”, explicó el médico. Ahora bien, es arriesgado determinar hasta qué edad podremos vivir. Pero, según la Ciencia, no importa qué tantos avances científicos se logren, el límite de la vida humana son los 150 años, afirma la investigación.",

    "text": "Mientras la Asamblea Nacional aprobó la normativa para asegurar la asignación directa y oportuna de recursos a los Gobiernos Autónomos Descentralizados (GAD), el veto refleja el desinterés y la falta de responsabilidad del Ejecutivo, afirmó la Revolución Ciudadana (RC).\nEn un comunicado divulgado este jueves, la bancada de la RC apuntó que la deuda del Gobierno con los GAD supera los mil millones de dólares, con lo cual se afecta la población que más necesita de los servicios y proyectos de las administraciones locales.\nTambién el Partido Social Cristiano (PSC), movimiento de derecha, rechazó la objeción del mandatario y aseveró que el Gobierno pretende “pagar en papeles desvalorizados, y a cuenta gotas, el dinero que debe ser en efectivo y completo para las parroquias, cantones y provincias”.\nEn opinión del PSC, el Ejecutivo no puede apoderarse de dinero ajeno aduciendo que está quebrado y calificó la actitud de Noboa como un acto inconstitucional, ilegal y no ético.\n“Ahora los ecuatorianos tienen claro quién los perjudica para beneficiar a acreedores externos”, enfatizó el PSC.\nLa iniciativa, aprobada en mayo pasado, fue planteada por el legislador socialcristiano Henry Kronfle, en 2021.\nAsimismo, el Consorcio de Gobiernos Autónomos Provinciales del Ecuador (Congope), entidad que representa a las 23 prefecturas, lamentó el veto total a una ley que apuntaba al desarrollo de los territorios con la asignación ágil de los recursos, que son vitales para generar obras y servicios.\nro/avr",

    "text": "“The Biden administration is importing millions of third-world immigrants to live here illegally, and at the same time telling them that white people are the source of their problems. How’s that going to work out in the end?” Tucker Carlson said. More than 10 million illegal aliens – mainly military-age men from Africa, Middle East and Latin America have invaded the US since Joe Biden was installed in January 2021. The illegal aliens are being told by the Democrat-media complex that white people – specifically white men – are the world’s problems. On Christmas Day a black man stabbed two teen girls in the Dining Concourse of Grand Central Terminal in a racially motivated attack.\nGrand Central stabber Steven Hutcherson The Grand Central stabber shouted, “I want all the white people dead,” and then said, “I want to sit next to the crackers!” Trump advisor and founder of America First Legal Stephen Miller joined Tucker Carlson to discuss the invasion of the millions of military-age illegals from third-world countries thanks to Joe Biden.
