    "text": "Devocional Reconozcamos nuestras debilidades Por lo cual, por amor a Cristo me gozo en las debilidades, en insultos, en necesidades, en persecuciones, en angustias; porque cuando soy débil, entonces soy fuerte. (2 Corintios 12: 10) Es difícil que reconozcamos nuestras debilidades, porque pensamos que esto nos resta y que los demás no nos verán igual. Entonces la imagen que hemos proyectado se caerá; por eso seguimos ocultando nuestros temores, inseguridades y complejos. Callarlos es un gran error, porque cuando algo no se reconoce y se oculta no puede solucionarse. Al contrario, se agrava más y repercute en otras áreas que no estaban débiles pero, por callar, estas son afectadas. Así vemos que, por no afrontar nuestras debilidades con valentía, nos enredamos en un mundo de mentiras y engaño del cual se nos hace difícil salir, ya que nos acostumbramos a mentir por seguir encubriendo. Por eso, creamos a nuestro alrededor un mundo que no permite que Dios convierta lo débil en fuerte. Solamente cuando lo reconocemos Él nos hará fuertes, porque Su palabra dice “Diga el débil: Fuerte soy”. Pastora Montserrat Bogaert",

    "text": "聯合新聞網 國巨被動元件漲價 有動作 6月起調高鉭電容報價 閱讀全文 記者李孟珊／台北報導 2025年4月2日 下午4:02\nAI需求激增，被動元件市場掀起漲價風。市場昨（2）日瘋傳國巨集團對供應鏈發出漲價通知信，內容為6月1日調高發展AI必備的被動元件鉭電容報價。據悉，國巨集團此次鉭電容漲幅達雙位數百分比以上。\n國巨集團昨天並未對漲價傳聞置評。受相關消息激勵，國巨（2327）昨天股價強勢表態，終場勁揚逾7%並重回500元大關之上、收523元，大漲34.5元；另一被動元件大廠華新科也上漲2.9元、收91.1元。\n根據業界流傳的國巨集團發給供應鏈的漲價通知信，此次是國巨集團旗下基美調升鉭電容價格。信中提到，由於原料、勞工、設備成本上升，為了維持獲利，調整鉭質電容售價，調整規格包含2.5V至10V的47uF-330uF，新價格將於6月1日生效。\n相關漲價通知信並未提到報價漲幅，業界推估，應有雙位數百分比以上，漲價效應帶動下，將助攻國巨業績表現。\n法人指出，國巨是全球最大晶片電阻、鉭電容，以及第三大積層陶瓷電容（MLCC）和電感製造商，在AI時代拔得頭籌，旗下基美在全球鉭電容市占超過四成，具有絕對話語權。\n業界分析，AI時代來臨，鉭電容扮演關鍵角色，特色是高電容和小尺寸，適合高階應用，包括AI伺服器、AI電腦、交換器、加速卡、自動駕駛、數據存儲及電腦視覺等領域。\n另一方面，AI伺服器對於鉭電容、MLCC用量提升非常多，以傳統伺服器用量2,000顆計算，AI伺服器用量將達2萬顆，GB200更將達20萬顆，且耐溫要求提高，因此價格也比傳統產品高出數倍之多。\n即便AI對鉭電容用量大增，但全球前三大鉭電容廠基美、松下、AVX均未擴產，使得部份鉭電容料號去年第4季起即開始缺貨，現階段供需缺口更達一成以上，業界密切關注國巨集團開出鉭電容漲價第一槍後，松下、AVX等廠商是否也會開始調升價格，推升新一波漲勢。\n國巨集團積極布局AI應用，董事長陳泰銘曾多次高喊，「國巨在AI領域絕不缺席」，並透露輝達及相關AI伺服器代工廠等AI主要參與者，都是國巨的客戶，國巨集團產品也已導入上一代及新一代AI伺服器，估算目前AI應用營收占比約5%，若以AI伺服器主要使用的MLCC規格X6S來看，國巨已經是台灣本土最大供應商。\n法人看好，國巨集團擁有完整的AI解決方案產品線，除了鉭電容報價率先喊漲，MLCC也將跟隨AI應用增長格局，用量隨之放大，後續將明顯助攻營運動能，業績吞大補丸可期。\n閱讀秘書／鉭電容\n鉭電容（Tantalum electrolytic capacitor）是被動元件的一種，共有聚合物鉭電容（Polymer Tantalum）、 二氧化錳鉭電容（MnO2 Tantalum）等兩種材料，目前全球前三大供應商為國巨集團旗下基美，還有松下、AVX。\n鉭電容能創造出具有低ESR（等效串聯電阻）、低漏電流、高漣波電流與較小外殼尺寸的電容器，並且沒有老化、受板彎應力產生裂縫、噪音，以及受溫度變化造成容值飄移等缺點，而Polymer鉭電容更勝於MnO2鉭電容。（李孟珊）\n【看原文連結】\n更多udn報導\n看似健康卻是升糖陷阱 營養師指3零食患糖尿病風險高\n小孩同學生日「送全班1人1份禮物」 律師見價格驚了\n南韓人怒了！台人赴韓賞櫻圍圈嗨喊Team Taiwan挨罵\n記者會後又1品牌掰了 金秀賢粉絲斥「透過他才知道你們」",

    "text": "Pack the bags and go. Last year, I swapped my familiar Groningen for bustling Berlin. I live in the Friedrichshain district, known for its punk roots. After the fall of the wall, it became a magnet for creative minds. But I soon realized that Berlin’s creative culture doesn’t just spawn vibrant murals. It also opens the doors to an open-minded approach when it comes to food. Why you need to know this: From cutting-edge vertical farms to lab-grown fish: developments in the field of food are currently hard to keep up with. In Berlin, there is an awful lot to discover. Anyone strolling through Berlin’s neighbourhoods will come across a Gemüse Kebab tent every 10 minutes: a vegetarian version of the traditional kebab, packed with grilled vegetables and sauces, served in a pita roll. Hallelujah, I thought the first time I took my first bite of such a sandwich. I have been a vegetarian for more than a decade and unfortunately all too familiar with bland vegetable ‘meatballs’ or ‘steaks’ tough as a shoe sole. The Gemüse Kebab not only excites my taste buds, but also my curiosity. Are there any more tasty, sustainable or technologically advanced developments to discover here in Berlin when it comes to food? Spoiler alert: the German capital is way ahead. In the mini series Bits ‘n Bites, I take you on a journey of discovery. Meatless, but tasty ‘Plant-based’ here in Berlin goes beyond the Gemüse Kebab or the oat milk in your cappuccino. Work is in full swing on next-gen meat substitutes, for example based on mycelium: the root of a fungus. I visit start-up Bosque Foods.The company grows mycelium in dedicated vertical farms, then turns it into whole pieces of meat substitutes, which resemble chicken or pork fillets. The process takes less than 10 days. In this way, the start-up is accelerating the transition to environmentally and animal-friendly sources of protein. The German capital is also making strides in the field of cultured meat and fish. I go for coffee at Bluu Seafood. The start-up uses stem cell technology to develop their products. This starts with a one-off ‘fish biopsy’, in which the fish are not killed. Stem cells are then grown into complete cell lines in a laboratory environment. The company focuses on Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and carp. This places Bluu in the group of companies working on solutions to problems within the fishing industry, such as overfishing, heavy metal and plastic pollution, and animal cruelty. Agriculture of the future Just a step back into the food chain. Companies like Bosque and Bluu are making full use of vertical farms. Considerable progress is also being made in that area. That’s why I will be the first to visit Berlin start-up Lite & Fog. They build advanced vertical farms that use ultrasound and artificial intelligence. Plants thus grow in the best possible way; perfect for the development of ingredients to be processed in meatless alternatives and cultured meat or fish. Among other things, the use of advanced technologies ensures much higher crop yields. Moreover, the special machines use significantly less water compared to conventional farming methods. How much exactly? We will find out. On the move In short: plenty of reasons to go exploring. I sincerely hope the hard-working companies here in Berlin have the time to welcome a curious journalist!",

    "text": "Google Just Made It Even Easier to Find the Cheapest Flights A new dedicated feature on the search platform will show the cheapest flights available for your next trip. [| Marco Bottigelli/Moment/Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/crowd-of-people-in-galleria-vittorio-emanuele-ii-at-royalty-free-image/1669837323?phrase=travel+destination&searchscope=image%2Cfilm&adppopup=true) [| Marco Bottigelli/Moment/Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/crowd-of-people-in-galleria-vittorio-emanuele-ii-at-royalty-free-image/1669837323?phrase=travel+destination&searchscope=image%2Cfilm&adppopup=true) I think it is great that Google Flights has a ton of features. They are all so cool. But if I am honest with myself and everyone else, my sole focus when using the platform is finding the absolute [cheapest flight possible](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/best-tips-for-finding-cheap-flights). If there were a \"standing room only\" option, I'd complain endlessly about it, but I'd also take full advantage of it if it meant saving a couple hundred bucks on a roundtrip ticket. That said, I am very interested in Google's newest feature, which will make finding the cheapest flights easier. The new Google Flights feature is a \"Cheapest\" tab that will put all the cheapest flights in one spot. \"When you search with Google Flights, the best options appear at the top of the results, based on a mix of price and convenience,\" a Google [statement ](https://blog.google/products/search/google-flights-cheapest-tab/)about the new feature reads. \"But sometimes, there might be cheaper options available for those of you who are willing to give up some convenience for the best deal.\" Now, there will be a tab for the best flights based on departing times, number of layovers, and other factors, as well as a tab for the cheapest flights. That second tab will only consider the price. In the image above, you can see the example on the mobile version. If you are a [Millennial](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/booking-flights-mobile-desktop-internet-debate) and prefer booking on your laptop or desktop, the feature will also be available there. The \"Cheapest\" tab will feature what Google calls \"more…creative itineraries, like longer layovers, self-transfers or purchasing different legs of the trip through multiple airlines or booking sites.\" If you are willing to spend 30 hours getting from San Francisco to Paris, that is the tab for you. If you don't book through multiple airlines or [longer layovers](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/time-needed-to-leave-airport-during-layover)—or maybe even prefer them—you can find significant travel savings by using the option. The feature will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks, so if you're looking for cheap flights before then, you can use some of the other money-saving [Google Flights ](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/google-flights-travel-hack-cheapest-airfare-tiktok)[hacks](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/google-flights-travel-hack-cheapest-airfare-tiktok) that are available now.

    "text": "How ‘X-Men ’97’ Contextualizes Morph’s Gender Identity in the ’90s\nMorph can change into any being he wants. That makes Morph one of the best X-Men characters. And with X-Men ’97, we have gotten to learn a bit more about how Morph identifies and there needs to be some clarification in how we all talk about the character.\nBefore the show premiered, we got news that\nMorph, a.k.a. Kevin Sydney, identified as nonbinary. Though with the show being set in the ’90s, that means that Morph doesn’t use they/them pronouns. In fact, you probably don’t hear “nonbinary” in the series. In an interview with CBR, Morph’s voice actor J.P. Karliak (who identifies as genderqueer) talked about how terminology was different in the ’90s and says the show will reflect that.\n“Two things about that,” said Karliak, “one, as far as I know, we’re never going to say the word ‘nonbinary’ because nobody said the word ‘nonbinary’ in the ’90s. It’s not that it didn’t exist; it was just in no way a mainstream term at the time. Morph’s understanding of who he is could equate to what a modern person would say is nonbinary, but he just doesn’t have the terminology for it. At the same time, they/them wasn’t a concept in terms of using it as a pronoun.”\nKarliak went on to talk about his own connection with Morph. “There are so many ways I identify with Morph, but one of them is that I personally identify as gender-queer, which some might say is an offshoot of nonbinary, but I use he/him pronouns,” he continued. “A lot of that has to do with the fact that I’m in my 40s and I came into my full understanding of my gender in my late 30s. I’ve always used he/him pronouns, and they feel like an old college sweatshirt, where maybe they don’t fit all that well, but they’re still really comfy and, until I find something better, I’ll just keep using that.”\nIn our own interview with Karliak, he spoke about Morph’s identity as well and said that Morph’s pronouns are he/him while he still identifies as nonbinary.\nYou can watch Morph’s journey on X-Men ’97, currently airing on Disney+!\n(featured image: Disney+)\nHave a tip we should know?\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8cf8e5fcffccf8e4e9e1edfef5fff9e9a2efe3e1)",

    "text": "By Douglas McIntyre ,\n1 hour ago\nFlorida avoided a direct hit by the Beryl Category 5 hurricane, which days later swamped Houston. South Florida did get near-record rain but recovered quickly in most areas. A new storm is headed toward the state; this time, some areas of Florida may not be as lucky.\nHurricane News –Next Hurricane Will Be Named “Chris”\nA new tropical rainstorm will almost reach southern Florida in two days. AccuWeather expects the storm may strengthen. AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno commented “There’s not much dry air or disruptive wind shear in the path of this tropical rainstorm. The east coast and west coast of Florida are both on the table. We need to watch this storm carefully over the next 48 hours.” The fact that Accuweather cannot make a more accurate forecast so close to landfall is disturbing and one of the reasons these storms are hard to prepare for. Hurricanes could cause $1 billion in damage in Florida this year.\nThe reason for worry about the new storm is that parts of Florida, particularly Miami, have large parts of their land below sea level. Inches of rain and a storm surge make the situation a considerable challenge regarding people and valuable property. Forecasters believe almost two-thirds of Miami could be underwater by 2060. In reality, that problem could hit the city much earlier. Miami is a huge risk for hurricanes this year.\nThe storm poses one more risk. It is moving slowly. Wherever it makes landfall, the effects will last, meaning a long period of heavy wind and rain.\nMore from ClimateCrisis 247 Heat And Wildfire Weather Will Intensify This Summer US May Or May Not BeThreatened By New Atlantic Storm Home Insurance Hit By $15 Billion Loss–Including California, Florida New Jersey Is State Worst Prepared For Climate Crisis Expand All Read in NewsBreak",

Grâce à une excellente gestion de l’énergie, et aussi à un travail aérodynamique de premier ordre, l’EQS, notamment, revendique l’une des meilleures autonomies du marché. Mais justement, cet aspect de galet sur roues n’a guère séduit, et on reproche beaucoup au modèle d’être assez « commun », et surtout de ne pas ressembler à une Mercedes. Le constructeur a reçu le message.\nLa Mercedes EQS 2024 veut affirmer son look Mercedes – Mercedes-Benz\nUne étoile à la pointe du capot Pour cette version mise à jour, il aura suffi de pas grand-chose pour réaffirmer l’identité de la voiture : des barrettes chromées dans la fausse calandre fermée, et une véritable étoile émergeant à la pointe du capot. Subitement, en effet, ceci redevient une Mercedes. Ce n’est qu’une étape, car le constructeur a déjà confirmé que ce style serait abandonné pour les prochaines générations. Sur le plan technique, on note que Mercedes adopte une nouvelle batterie de 118 kWh (au lieu de 108), qui augmente l’autonomie de quelque 82 km, soit un total WLTP de 683 à 822 km selon la version. Enfin, la capacité de remorquage passe de 750 kg à 1.700 kg.\nAutomobileMercedes EQS Manufaktur: La personnalisation porte un nomAutomobileLa nouvelle Mercedes CLE n’est pas simplement un coupé",
