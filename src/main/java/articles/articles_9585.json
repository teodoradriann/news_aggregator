    "text": "Azerbaijan-Armenia peace will serve interests of all regional countries: Iran foreign minister\nIran Press TV\nThursday, 28 December 2023 7:57 AM\nIranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says the establishment of peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia will serve the interests of all countries in the region.\nIn a meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in Yerevan on Wednesday, Amir-Abdollahian welcomed an agreement by Azerbaijan and Armenia to solve their existing disputes.\nHe added that regional countries have the capacity to settle their differences on their own and help establish peace and stability in the region, warning that the presence of extra-regional powers would further complicate the situation in the region.\nThe top Iranian diplomat stressed the importance of making use of the regional countries' capacities, including the 3+3 format of cooperation, to promote peace and guarantee the peace agreement in the Caucasus region.\nThe 3+3 format features the three South Caucasus countries of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan plus Russia, Turkey, and Iran.\nIt was created in 2020 to promote peace and development in South Caucasus and resolve outstanding issues such as the status of Karabakh region.\nAzerbaijan recaptured the long-disputed Karabakh region in a September lightning offensive against Armenian separatist forces, which prompted over 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee the region.\nAfter just one day of fighting, Armenian separatist authorities, which had controlled Karabakh for three decades, surrendered and agreed to reintegrate with Baku.\nArmenia and Azerbaijan have said they are close to signing a peace agreement based on the recognition of each other's territorial integrity.\nThe long-disputed region of Karabakh was at the center of two costly wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020 and the 1990s.\nElsewhere in the meeting, the foreign minister said Iran's foreign policy attaches importance to improvement of relations with neighboring countries, including Armenia.\nTehran and Yerevan enjoy positive and growing relations, but they should accelerate the implementation of the agreements already reached between the two sides, particularly in the economic fields, Amir-Abdollahian added.\nThe Armenian premier, for his part, hailed developing mutual relations and called for preparing the ground for the expansion of ties.\nPashinyan commended Iran's principled stance on regional developments which would help establish sustainable peace in the Caucasus.\nIran and Armenia should make all the necessary preparations for boosting trade exchanges, he emphasized.\nIran, Armenia eye increasing trade exchange to $3bn: Amir-Abdollahian\nIn a meeting with Armenia's Secretary of the Security Council Armen Grigoryan on Wednesday, Amir-Abdollahian said the two countries are expanding relations but should make further efforts to increase the value of trade exchanges to 3 billion dollars.\nHe added that Iran's principled and fixed policy is based on safeguarding international borders and respecting the countries' territorial integrity.\nRegional issues must be solved by the countries in the region, the top Iranian diplomat pointed out.\nGrigoryan said his country enjoys the highest level of dynamic relations with Iran and hailed Tehran's support for Armenia's territorial integrity.\nArmenia is determined to further boost relations with Iran, he added.\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

    "title": "Magnus Carlsen Aims To Defend Titles At 2024 Rapid Chess Championship - The Pinnacle Gazette",
    "text": "Magnus Carlsen, the reigning world champion, is set to defend his titles at the 2024 Rapid Chess World Championship, which kicked off on December 26, 2024, in New York City. The championship, which features some of the best players globally, will see Carlsen not only aiming for victory but also showcasing his remarkable skill set as he embarks on this prestigious tournament.\nAccording to NRK, the excitement builds as Carlsen competes against top competitors like Awonder Liang and Denis Kadric from Montenegro. Carlsen started the tournament with notable performances, securing 1.5 points from his first two games. Unfortunately, his first game against Liang resulted in a draw, after 68 moves where both players evenly matched each other's strategies. Carlsen expressed some disappointment, indicating he might have been somewhat unlucky with the pairing, as reported by NRK.\n“I was somewhat unlucky with the pairing in the first round,” Carlsen stated, reflecting on his match against the talented young American stormester.\nDespite this challenging start, he quickly regained his footing, demonstrating his mastery over the board by achieving victory against Kadric with relative ease. NRK chess expert Torstein Bae praised Carlsen’s performance, saying, “This was very solid. No problems with the white pieces.” This success places Carlsen back on track as he journeys through the rounds of this championship.\nThe tournament format consists of 13 rounds of rapid chess, where each player has 15 minutes of total game time working with quick, strategic thinking. Players also gain 10 seconds added to their time for every move made, allowing for high-paced and thrilling matches.\nCarlsen’s engagement with the pieces is paralleled by his insightfulness. When reflecting on his games so far, he rated his performance as “maybe four out of ten.” He mentioned feeling more prepared this time around than he had during past championships. “I feel fine and more prepared than I often have been during the first rounds of the World Championship,” he said.\nThis year, not only is the chess world watching Carlsen defend his titles, but Norway also stands proud with eight competitors poised to make their mark. Along with Carlsen and Kadric, Aryan Tari is another notable player making waves, as they compete fiercely throughout the rounds.\nCarlsen’s storied past includes winning multiple titles, with seven of those victories coming from blitz chess and five from rapid chess competitions. His recent successes reinforce his dedication and commitment to these fast-paced formats, illustrating his complete dominance of the games. Just before Christmas, Carlsen had showcased his skills by triumphing over his childhood rival, Jan Nepomnjasjtsjij, solidifying his status as the world’s best.\nThe tournament will provide spirited competition, especially with Carlsen’s legacy on the line. Observers hope this championship will see him rise once again and add to his impressive resume. After all, entering this championship, the expected 13 rounds are anticipated to not only test the players but provide thrilling chess moments to spectators worldwide.\nViewers are encouraged to keep following the action live as the championship progresses through the end of December, captured through NRK’s coverage which will continue through the holiday period.\nThere's no denying the anticipation surrounding Magnus Carlsen as he steps onto the board once again to confront his opponents, showcasing why he remains the titleholder and the main focus of the chess world. With rounds still to be played, every move he makes will be analyzed and discussed by fans and experts alike as they cheer for their champion.",

    "text": "CINCINNATI ( WXIX /Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

J&K Police will try at every level to curb recruitment in terror ranks and put an end to the cycle of violence,” Swain said, addressing the DGP’s customary year-end news conference in Jammu.\nAttributing the dip to collaborative efforts of police and other security forces, Swain said 113 terrorists were “neutralised” in 2023, leaving 31 local operatives active, an all-time low. “27 are in Kashmir zone and four in Jammu,” the DGP added.\nSwain pointed out that two more separatist organisations were banned under UAPA this year, Democratic Freedom Party led by Shabir Shah and Muslim League led by Masarat Alam.\nAccording to the DGP, the security forces’ war is not only against the gun-wielding terrorists but also the ideology which pushes J&K youths towards bloodshed and separatism. “Our war will continue against those who glorify and legitimise terrorist actions. The fight will continue till this ideology is wiped out,” Swain said.\nOutlining the focus of future offensives, the DGP indicated that it would be against infiltrators. “Foreigners are taking the front (in terror). It is clear that the future fight will be against those who infiltrate from outside,” Swain said. He was flanked by ADGP Vijay Kumar and other top officers.\nFor more news like this visit TOI.

    "title": "Feds’ new ‘anti-harassment’ mandate to universities: Violate the First Amendment | The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression",
    "text": "Table of Contents Feds’ new ‘anti-harassment’ mandate to universities: Violate the First Amendment - The University of Michigan, the City University of New York, and Lafayette College all faced federal investigations in recent months for refusing to investigate protected political speech. - The government’s new “cumulative” theory of harassment threatens campus speech and protest, as well as student and faculty speech online, in defiance of clear Supreme Court precedent. - The chilling message is clear: To avoid federal anti-discrimination investigations, schools will have little choice but to violate the First Amendment. PHILADELPHIA, June 27, 2024 — The Department of Education is required by law to guard against discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in higher education. Now the agency is telling college and university administrators they can only achieve this important goal by violating the First Amendment. That’s the chilling takeaway from agreements publicized this month between the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights and the [University of Michigan](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-two-complaints-against-university-michigan-alleging-antisemitic-discrimination), the [City University of New York](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-nine-complaints-against-city-university-new-york-alleging-discrimination-based-national-origin-including-antisemitic-anti-palestinian-anti-muslim-and-anti-arab-harass), and [Lafayette College](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-complaint-against-lafayette-college-alleging-antisemitic-discrimination), which were under investigation for their post-October 7 responses to alleged anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. In some cases, when students complained about instances of political speech — such as a social media post using the phrase “from the river to the sea” or protesters shouting about “Nazi liberation” — the schools correctly determined the expression is First Amendment-protected speech. But to meet institutional obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, OCR now says campus administrators should have continued investigating. To keep their federal funding, colleges and universities now must investigate student or faculty expression to “assess whether incidents individually or cumulatively created a hostile environment for students, faculty, or staff” — even where the speakers don’t coordinate. “This unconstitutional mandate rewrites the rules of campus speech,” said Alex Morey, vice president of campus advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. “OCR has invented a completely new standard that needlessly pits First Amendment rights against federal anti-discrimination law, dangling the threat of punishment over every discussion.” It’s been a quarter-century since the Supreme Court defined harassment in higher education in 1999’s [Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education](https://www.thefire.org/supreme-court/aurelia-davis-next-friend-lashonda-d-v-monroe-county-board-education-et-al). That standard correctly holds that speech is not protected when it constitutes targeted, discriminatory conduct “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and opportunities.” This strikes the right balance between two imperatives: protecting campus discourse on even the most controversial issues and guarding against discriminatory harassment. As OCR reminded schools in the years that followed Davis, discriminatory harassment [must include](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/firstamend.html) “something beyond the mere expression of views, words, symbols or thoughts that some person finds offensive.” OCR was also explicit that its “regulations are not intended to restrict the exercise of any expressive activities protected under the U.S. Constitution,” and that there “is no conflict between the civil rights laws that this Office enforces and the civil liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment.” But this month’s revelations mean these important limits, troublingly, no longer hold. While Davis properly drew the line between protected and unprotected speech in the context of harassment, OCR’s directives to UMich, CUNY, and Lafayette have scribbled all over it. The new settlement agreements also represent the latest instance of whiplash for college administrators saddled with years of ping-ponging mandates on how to meet ever-changing government guidelines. Consider the conundrum now faced by the UMich, sued in 2018 for a bias-investigation protocol that violated students’ First Amendment rights. UMich [agreed](https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/key-issues/speech-first-inc-v-mark-schlissel/#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20Michigan%20and,free%20speech%20rights%20of%20students.) to change its policies to better protect expressive rights as a result of that litigation. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit [found](https://www.thefire.org/news/sixth-circuit-properly-finds-university-michigan-bias-response-team-could-chill-students) that UMich’s bias response team was likely to chill students’ speech because it had the ability to refer cases to administrators who could impose punishment. But now OCR is telling UMich it’s not investigating enough allegedly biased speech. The new mandates set a deeply chilling precedent for students or faculty with dissenting, minority, or simply unpopular political views, on or off campus, who may now find themselves on the wrong side of not only a harassment allegation, but a mandatory government investigation — regardless of the allegation’s merits. And, of course, schools like UMich are freshly vulnerable to a new round of First Amendment lawsuits. Courts, not OCR, determine the limits of First Amendment rights. Make no mistake: Without course-correction, students and faculty with controversial views will soon face formal investigations for expressing themselves. “The implication that these institutions violated Title VI because they didn’t do enough to respond to constitutionally protected expression is a field day for would-be censors,” said Tyler Coward, FIRE’s lead counsel for government affairs. “Because of these settlement agreements, universities nationwide will choose to censor first and ask questions later, silencing speech on hot-button topics instead of letting students and faculty discuss and debate without fear of discipline.” Students have the right to learn on a harassment-free campus. They also have the right to express themselves consistent with the First Amendment.
