    "text": "Zillow analyzed page views and days on market to find the most popular placesProspective homebuyers generally gravitated toward smaller cities in 2023The analysis showed a swing away from the Midwest toward the Northeast\nWest Chester, Pennsylvania, was the most popular place for people looking to buy a home in 2023, according to analysis from Zillow.\nThe real estate marketplace analyzed metrics that indicated consumer demand – including page-view traffic, home value growth and days listed before being sold – for more than 2,000 US cities.\nAll of the top ten were in the Northeast – a shift from last year when the Midwest dominated and Prairie Village, Kansas, was top.\nWest Chester – a ‘quaint’ town of about 20,000 people, which is just over an hour’s drive from Philadelphia – took over the crown, with a surge of page views on listings in the area.\nProspective homebuyers generally gravitated toward smaller cities in 2023, the report showed. Of the 10 most popular markets, only one – Manchester, New Hampshire – has a population of more than 100,000, and the majority are less than half that size.\nWest Chester, Pennsylvania , was the most ‘popular’ housing market in 2023, according to analysis from real estate marketplace Zillow\nZillow reported that a ‘strong interest’ in the West Chester area has helped push home values up about 8 percent in the last year.\nThe typical home in West Chester is worth about $584,000, putting it among the more expensive cities in Pennsylvania.\n‘But given its relative affordability compared to larger cities nearby such as New York City and Washington DC, those looking for a break from city life may see West Chester as an attractive and affordable place to call home,’ the report read.\nWest Chester ranked within the top 100 cities in page views per listing among the nearly 2,300 cities included in Zillow’s rankings, far outperforming its size.\nAlmost two thirds of those views came from outside the city, the analysis found, which is a possible signal of interest in moving in.\nAlthough West Chester took the top spot, seven of the 10 most popular markets of 2023 were located in New England.\nWest Chester – a ‘quaint’ town of about 20,000 people, which is just over an hour’s drive from Philadelphia – took the crown for the most ‘popular’ housing market in 2023\nNashua and Manchester in New Hampshire ranked second and third, followed by Connecticut’s Wethersfield and West Hartford in fourth and fifth place.\nStow, Ohio, came in sixth place, Middletown, Connecticut in seventh, and Twinsburg, Ohio, in eighth.\nZillow ranked Newington, Connecticut in ninth place and Concord, New Hampshire, rounded off the 10 most popular markets of 2023.\nThe real estate company also singled out some breakout towns in specific categories.\nIt ranked Chula Vista, California, which has a population of around 278,000 and a typical home value of $808,000, as the most popular large city in the US in 2023.\nSouth Portland, Maine, was the most popular seaside town, while Vermilion, Ohio, took the top spot among vacation towns.\nNorth Carolina’s Pinehurst edged out Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, for the top retirement town.\nWest Chester also ranked first among college towns, with Kent, Ohio, coming in just behind.\nIt comes as mortgage rates have fallen for the ninth consecutive week – offering much-needed respite to prospective homebuyers heading into the new year.\nMortgage rates have fallen for their ninth consecutive week, ending the year at their lowest point since May\nData from Government-backed lender Freddie Mac shows the average rate on a 30-year home loan is now 6.61 percent, down from 6.67 percent last week, and at its lowest point since May.\nIt is good news for home shoppers after rates soared to a peak of 7.79 percent in late October.\nHowever, the average buyer still faces paying around $800 per month more now on a home loan than if they had bought two years ago.",

    "text": "New Year’s weekend revellers will need to wrap up as strong winds, heavy rain and even ice and frost are set to make travel conditions potentially challenging.\nMet Éireann said the first week of 2024 also looks likely to prove quite unsettled as a low-pressure weather front will bring blustery conditions with rainfall expected to be well above early January norms.\nDespite the unsettled weather expected for the weekend, there will be patches of bright sunshine at times, but those attending outdoor New Year’s Eve celebrations are urged to dress warmly.\nTemperatures will drop by six degrees overnight, with frost, ice and possibly snow on higher ground over the weekend.\nThe good news is that calmer weather is expected from January 8 thanks to a high-pressure front arriving in the Atlantic, although there will still be some showers around.\nA status orange alert was lifted from four southern and western counties, providing some relief for local authorities that gust-related damage was not as severe as initially feared.\nBoth Cork County Council and Kerry County Council said there was no serious property or infrastructure damage in the wake of Storm Gerrit.\nMet Éireann said there was the potential for very challenging driving conditions over the next 24 hours.\n“Friday will be rather windy for a time, with some sunshine and scattered showers,” a spokesperson said.\n“The showers won’t be as widespread as Wednesday, Thursday. However, rain will continue in parts of the north and the north-west, some of it heavy, with a chance of localised flooding.\n“Showers will persist through Friday night and rain will spread from the north-east overnight with the potential for some areas of higher ground to get sleet or even snow.\n“Temperatures will sink to as low as minus 2C or even minus 3C in some areas. Saturday will be windy or very windy with rain clearing to sunny spells and scattered showers.”\nMet Éireann said winds would ease over tomorrow night, although showers would persist in many areas.\nSome areas – particularly those on higher ground – could see frost and ice.\n“Sunday will probably be a breezy and chilly day with scattered showers and moderate to fresh north-west winds and highest temperatures of 5C to 8C,” the spokesperson added.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionnán Sheahan’s exclusive take on the day’s news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.",

    "text": "To President Biden!\n2024-08-16: #In the next debate, Trump should talk about abolishing EV tax incentives\n#China's presence is growing in South America, including Bolivia and Argentina\n#America should have abandoned Ukraine and invested in South America\nAt the next debate, Mr. Trump should talk about abolishing EV preferential treat-ment. Mr. Trump should state that the next generation of automobiles are hydrogen automobiles and HVs are temporary automobiles. The United States will not pro-mote \"EVs\" in order to avoid war.\nChile, which was the first in Latin America to establish diplomatic relations with China, is China's number one trading partner in both exports and imports. I hope that the day will come when the United States will export hydrogen automobiles to \"Chile\".\nLast year, President Boric, who visited China and met with President Xi Jinping, ex-pressed his expectations for China's role in lithium development. The United States should have abandoned Ukraine and invested in South America.\nPresident Boric: \"I highly appreciate that China has shown great interest in invest-ing in our country in strategic projects such as lithium in recent years. Chile and China can become strategic partners in promoting the development of lithium.\"\nEven if Japan wants to enter, it can't enter? The two conditions that the Chilean government requires from partner companies are financial supply capacity and high operational capacity, and experts point out that financial capacity is particularly im-portant.\n60% of lithium interest acquisitions are from China! China's presence is also grow-ing in South America, including Bolivia and Argentina. The United States staged a \"coup\" in Bolivia, but it failed.\nIn Bolivia, in 2023, two Chinese companies, including China's major battery manu-facturer \"CATL,\" signed an agreement with the Bolivian government to produce lith-ium in the \"Uyuni Salt Flats,\" which are rich in lithium, ahead of Japan, Europe, and the United States.\nIn Argentina, China's largest lithium development company, \"Ganfeng Lithium,\" has five lithium development projects with a total production capacity of more than 100,000 tons per year.\nIn 2022, the Biden administration enacted the IRA Inflation Control Act. Although the name is inflation control, it is said that the actual aim is to exclude China from the supply chain of important minerals in North America.\nIn March 2024, Mitsubishi Corporation announced that it would invest in a joint ven-ture with a Canadian mining development company to participate in the develop-ment of a lithium mine in Ontario, Canada.\nThe mine is expected to begin production around 2027, and annual lithium produc-tion is expected to be 20,000 tons, equivalent to the amount needed for batteries for approximately 300,000 EVs, so research is underway to commercialize the pro-ject.\nThe United States should withdraw from \"EVs\" and focus on developing \"hydrogen vehicles.\" Lithium secured in Canada and other countries should be used to make batteries for \"home appliances\" such as \"smartphones.\"\nNext-generation vehicles should be promoted as \"HVs\" as a \"temporary\" project, and \"hydrogen (internal combustion) vehicles\" in earnest. America should take ad-vantage of its strength in the \"internal combustion engine.\"\nIt would cost a huge amount to set up charging stations on the vast lands of Africa and South America. Global strategic vehicles only require hydrogen cartridge re-placement at G/s, so existing \"infrastructure\" can be utilized.\nHydrogen vehicles use the power of robots to replace hydrogen cartridges at G/s. Refueling takes less than 10 minutes. Of course, EV manufacturers should secure batteries and develop charging facilities.\nPart 1 Citations/References\nWill we one day be unable to make batteries? The global battle for battery metals\nWill we one day be unable to make batteries? The global battle for battery metals\nhttps://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240712/k10014510011000.html\nI will write again tomorrow.\nPart 2. Japan is a \"state of abnormal human rights violations\". \"Everyone\" of the \"international community\", please help!\nFirst of all, please read \"false accusation\" in the 2010 \"Crime of Supporting Violation of Immigration Law\".\nReason for punishment:\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nMy claim:\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence. You are now \"finished\". \"Aiding\" an act of innocence is innocence.\nA Chinese national who has engaged in “2” (activities outside the qualification) is not guilty. The reason is that the \"person who hired them\" has not been punished for \"promoting illegal employment\" under the Immigration Control Act. Therefore, by \"equality under the law\", the Chinese are innocent.\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence.

The reason is that the \"person who hired them\" has not been punished for \"promoting illegal employment\" under the Immigration Control Act. Therefore, by \"equality under the law\", the Chinese are innocent.\nThe revision of the Immigration Control Law in December 2016 made it possible to punish the act of \"providing\" \"false employment contract documents\".\nImplemented from January 2017. According to Article 39 of the Constitution, it is not possible to \"retroactively\" to the \"past\" and \"punish\".\nImplemented from January 2017.

An unusual number of people.\nProsecutors' \"(deprivation) of liberty\" is \"arbitrary.\" They are \"disobeying the law\" and \"selfish\". They have no \"(logical) (necessity)\". The prosecution is \"punishing\" \"as they wish\".\nIn 2010, \"me and the Chinese\" in the immigration violation case, and in 2013, Philippine Embassy staff and diplomats were also punished for the same reason.\n\"I\" argued \"not guilty\", explaining with \"logic of the law\".\nPolice and prosecutors then said, \"(You) should admit (your crime) in general terms.\"\nJapan is the only country that punishes in general terms! .\nThe judge stated \"Causal relationship\" with crazy \"logic\".

The charges are \"abuse of authority of a special public official\" and \"crimes of false complaints.\" The prosecution \"killed\" the \"accusation letter\" and \"accusation letter\" by \"ex officio.\" Therefore, the statute of limitations has been suspended.\nI am \"appealing\" two things.\n1: The foreigner performed \"illegal labor\" other than \"status of residence\". But foreigners are innocent because of \"equality under the law\".\n2: The prosecution “applied” “Articles 60 and 62 of the Penal Code” to Article 70 of the Immigration Control Act on the grounds of “support for Article 22-4-4 of the Immigration Act”. However, it is \"error of applicable law\". (as above).\n1: The foreigner performed \"illegal labor\" other than \"status of residence\".

(as above).\nKoreans make demands on Japan over the \"solved\" \"comfort women and forced laborers\" issue, but should support \"tens of thousands of Korean victims\" who have been punished for \"violating immigration laws.\" .\nThe Japanese government is hiding Japan's human rights violations by making up such things as \"human rights violations against Uyghurs in China.\"\n\"I\" am demanding \"restoration of honor\" and \"compensation\" for myself, the Chinese, and the Philippine Embassy officials.\nEveryone in the world! !

    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Christina Lake Cannabis Corp. (\" CLC \" or the \" Company \") (CSE: CLC) announced today that it will not be filing its annual financial statements, accompanying management's discussion and analysis and related chief executive officer (\" CEO \") and chief financial officer (\" CFO \") certifications for the financial year ended February 28, 2025 (collectively, the \" Annual Filings \"), within the period prescribed for the filing of such documents under Parts 4, 5 and 6 of National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations and pursuant to National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings , namely within 120 days of year-end, being June 30, 2025 (the \" Filing Deadline \").\nThe delay at CLC is due to the audit taking longer than expected, primarily because of the high level of testing required and the limited availability of staff resources. The Company's material item on its balance sheet is inventory and biological assets. Given the increased production levels over the past year and the introduction of additional product lines following the Midway acquisition, the process of costing and inventory allocation is taking longer than originally anticipated. Further, the financings completed in connection with the Midway acquisition earlier in 2024 have added to the workload, requiring additional time to ensure accuracy of the financial statements.\nCLC is working closely with its auditor DMCL LLP and is making every effort to submit the Annual Filings in a timely fashion and expects to file no later than July 14, 2025, and will issue a news release announcing the completion of such filings at that time.\nCLC CEO Mark Aiken stated, \"We support the provision of extra time to allow auditors to satisfactorily complete the 2024 audit and ensure that the financial statements are accurate in all respects.\"\nThe Company is providing this default announcement in accordance with National Policy 12-203 Management Cease Trade Orders (\" NP 12-203 \"). The Company has made an application to the British Columbia Securities Commission, as principal regulator of the Company, a management cease trade order (\" MCTO \") under NP 12-203 in respect of the default regarding the Annual Filings. The MCTO will prohibit the CEO and the CFO from trading in securities of CLC for so long as the Annual Filings are not filed. The issuance of the MCTO, if issued, does not affect the ability of persons other than the CEO and the CFO of the Company to trade in the Company's securities. The application for the MCTO remains subject to the risk factors described in \" Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors \" below, including the risk that the MCTO application may not be successful or may not be completed prior to a securities commission issuing a failure-to-file cease trade order against the Company following the Filing Deadline.\nThe Company confirms that it intends to satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines found at sections 9 and 10 of NP 12-203 respecting Cease Trade Orders for Continuous Disclosure Defaults for so long as it remains in default as a result of the late filing of the Annual Filings. During the period of default, the Company will issue biweekly default status reports in the form of further news releases, which will also be filed on SEDAR. The Company confirms that there are no insolvency proceedings against it as of the date of this news release. The Company also confirms that there is no other material information concerning the affairs of the Company that has not been generally disclosed as of the date of this news release.\nABOUT CLC\nChristina Lake Cannabis is a licensed producer of cannabis under the Cannabis Act. It has secured a standard cultivation license and corresponding processing amendment from Health Canada (March 2020 and August 2020, respectively) as well as a research and development license (early 2020).

    "text": "Universal is ready to sink its teeth into its live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon 2 .\nThe studio announced during its presentation at CinemaCon on Wednesday that the feature sequel is set to hit theaters June 11, 2027. The first live-action How to Train Your Dragon , based on DreamWorks Animation’s hit 2010 animated movie of the same name, is coming out June 13.\nFranchise mainstay Dean DeBlois returns for the sequel, along with castmembers Mason Thames as Hiccup and Nico Parker as Astrid. DeBlois, who has been involved with the franchise since its start, wrote and directed this year’s How to Train Your Dragon that is based on the 2010 project that he co-directed with Chris Sanders.\nDeBlois, Parker and fellow castmember Gerard Butler took the stage to announce the sequel.\nUniversal is clearly hot on the live-action How to Train Your Dragon , as the full film — focusing on Hiccup befriending the dragon Toothless — screened earlier Wednesday for CinemaCon attendees.\nThe animated How to Train Your Dragon 2 hit theaters in 2014 and featured the voices of Jay Baruchel, Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler and America Ferrera. The plot for the Oscar-nominated film centers on Hiccup (Baruchel) and Toothless uncovering a plot to harness an army of dragons.\nDuring a press event for the live-action How to Train Your Dragon that The Hollywood Reporter attended earlier this year, DeBlois discussed the origins of this summer’s movie.\n“With the rushed production schedule and the limited resources that we had on that first movie for DreamWorks, there were things that we skipped past that we could have maybe done a little more justice to — some of the characters, some of the depth of relationships and the immersive action,” he said. “It’s a reimagining that holds quite faithful to the story and yet finds moments where we could enrich character relationships, give a bit of depth, give a little bit of mythology that might have been lacking in that original.”\nThe franchise was inspired by the book series from author Cressida Cowell. Serving as producers on the live-action movies are DeBlois, Marc Platt and Adam Siegel.",
