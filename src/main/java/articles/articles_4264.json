    "text": "The Bold and the Beautiful Spoilers: Thomas surprises Hope with a marriage proposal amid murder accusations In The B&B episode of January 1, 2024: Hope faces a surprise marriage proposal from Thomas, but doubts linger, while Xander's murder accusations against Thomas lead to heightened tensions. Disclaimer: This article contains spoilers for The Bold and the Beautiful On Monday, January 1, brace yourselves for more drama on [The Bold and the Beautiful ](https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-spoilers-whats-the-surprising-connection-between-finn-and-the-forresters-is-uncovered-1267961)(B&B). But before we dive in, a quick heads-up: there won't be a new episode on Friday, December 29; you might catch a repeat or some football coverage depending on your time zone. The good news is that B&B will be back with a fresh episode on January 1. The Bold and the Beautiful Spoilers highlights In this upcoming episode, Hope Logan will finally respond to Thomas Forrester's surprise marriage proposal. However, there's a twist – it could be a fake-out. Hope might be feeling pressured and imagining that Thomas is moving too fast. There's a possibility she's more concerned about Thomas' obsessive side returning than she's letting on. On the flip side, Thomas is genuinely in love, and proposing is right up his alley. Hope may have to genuinely respond to this unexpected offer. But if she can't even say a direct \"I love you\" to Thomas yet, promising to marry him might not be the best move. Hope might have to gently let Thomas down and put the brakes on his grand plans. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Finn will press Xander to spill the beans on his murder accusations against Thomas, involving Emma Barber's car crash. Xander believes Thomas is responsible and warns Finn about Thomas being deeply disturbed. As the Thomas-related twists unfold, Xander may push Finn to intervene before things take a darker turn. The Bold and the Beautiful recap In yesterday's The Bold and the Beautiful episode, in the Forrester design office, there's tension between Thomas and Finn. Finn doesn't like how Thomas is talking to Steffy and steps in to protect her. Finn gets paged for a new patient, so Steffy tells him she can handle it. Thomas suggests that they focus on supporting Grandad instead of worrying about him and Hope. He thinks Finn, being an only child, doesn't understand sibling dynamics. Steffy feels Finn just wants to protect her, just like she wants to protect him. Thomas insists he's happy and wants to move on from past mistakes. He asks Steffy not to undermine his relationship with Hope. Steffy is concerned that Thomas might jeopardize his progress for Hope, but Thomas sees things differently. He believes the company is thriving, Douglas is doing well, and he's in love. Later, Ridge talks to Hope about Thomas and asks if there's a possibility of a future between them. Hope can't guarantee anything and shares her past with Liam. Ridge is worried about Thomas and suggests that Steffy lecturing Hope about Thomas could end badly for him. Hope and Thomas discuss the lectures they received. Hope understands the concern from Ridge and Steffy. Thomas appreciates her love and support, claiming she's made him a better man. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Thomas surprises Hope with a proposal, getting down on one knee with a ring, and asking her to marry him. Hope is left stunned.

    "title": "What the national nursing shortage means for Black patients",
    "text": "The number of skilled nurses leaving the profession each year has been called a national healthcare crisis, but the exodus will have a disproportionate impact on Black communities.\nBurned out after the COVID-19 pandemic and frustrated with systemic problems in healthcare, nurses in the U.S. are leaving the medical profession in droves, a quiet exodus that some are calling a national crisis.\nBut—as usual—a crisis in America is a catastrophe for Black America. Experts say the situation will exacerbate the lack of access to care for communities of color, increase the time it will take to get routine as well as urgent or specialized medical attention and further widen the health gap between Black and white patients.\nThe situation is considered so dire that the White House last August announced it had earmarked some $100 million through the Department of Health and Human Services to quickly grow the nation’s corps of nurses. At the same time, colleges, universities and teaching hospitals that specialize in nurse training are offering accelerated programs to get caregivers on the job as soon as possible.\n“Nurses are an essential part of our nation’s health care system,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement rolling out the Grow the Nursing Workforce grant program. “Now more than ever, we need to double down on our investments in nurses who care for communities across the country.”\nDeborah Trautman, president and CEO of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, said that generating “strong interest in nursing careers, and training new nurses” are top priorities for stakeholders like her organization.\n“Maintaining a healthy supply of practice-ready nurses is critical to ensuring access to essential patient care services and protecting the nation’s health,” she said in April.\nExperts say the overall nurse shortage stems from a combination of factors—chiefly, the COVID-19 pandemic, which called on nurses to work long hours in a highly-charged, uncertain environment. But others point to more mundane, long-term issues frustrating the workforce: poor working conditions, relatively low pay, high caseloads, and lack of support from hospital management.\nFor Black nurses, the issues also include racial bias on the job. Black Nurses are almost twice as likely to report racism on the job—bigotry, slurs, a patient’s refusal of treatment—than white nurses.\nWhy Black nurses matter\nAccording to data from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , there are only nine registered nurses on average for every 1,000 people. And only 6.7% of registered nurses are Black, even though Black people make up around 13% of the U.S. population.\nBlack nurses matter because multiple studies confirm Black patients are more likely to seek out care, follow instructions and have better overall health outcomes if their caregiver looks like them.\nResearch shows that patients who are of the same race as their healthcare provider have better outcomes. These improvements range from significant declines in Black infant mortality and an approximately 19% drop in mortality rates for Black men.\nBlack patients and patients of color also were more likely to get preventative care when their clinician shares their racial background. And 83% of Black mental health providers believe racial concordance is important to patient outcomes, according to the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities.\nBut nurses are heading for the exits in droves.\nA 2022 national workforce survey of almost 335,000 registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and licensed vocational nurses found that more than 25% of them were planning to leave the profession by 2027, through retirements as well as resignations, according to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predicts that between 2022 and 2032, the country will see 193,100 openings for registered nurses each year. But the actual workforce, according to the BLS, will likely increase by 177,400 each year.\nHowever, there was one bright spot amid all the data: Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are overperforming when it comes to nursing education. Only 2% of all colleges and universities are HBCUs but as of 2017 they had graduated almost 7% of nursing-school graduates.\nAnd a wealth of research shows the presence of Black nurses helps decrease health disparities. When patients and clinicians share the same racial or ethnic background Black infant mortality declines significantly and for Black men mortality can drop by as much as 19%.\nBlack patients are also more likely to pursue preventative care when their healthcare provider is Black. And a whopping 83% of Black mental health providers say this racial concordance is important to care outcomes .\nLegacy of discrimination\nYet, more than 40% of nurses said they experienced racism or discrimination while in nursing school, with nearly 80% of nurses calling for more diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training in nursing education, according to a 2023 Robert Wood Johnson survey and interviews of nearly 1,000 nurses.\nA combined 44% of respondents reported that racism or discrimination was part of their nursing school’s culture to some extent.\nThere’s evidence that the profession is trying to address racism within its ranks.\n“If we are to truly provide just and equitable care to our patients, we as nurses must hold ourselves accountable for our own behavior and work to change the systems that perpetuate racism and other forms of discrimination, said Beth Toner, RH, the foundation’s director of program communications.",

    "title": "一季度国内生产总值同比增长5.4% 中国经济开门红 应对外部挑战有底气_新闻频道_中国青年网",
    "text": "2025年一季度，中国经济实现开门红。\n“国民经济实现良好开局，高质量发展向新向好。”在国新办4月16日举行的新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运介绍，初步核算，一季度国内生产总值（GDP）318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。\n在全球主要经济体中名列前茅\n“增长”一词在这场发布会上频频出现。工业被喻为国民经济的“压舱石”。一季度，我国工业生产增长加快，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，比去年全年加快0.7个百分点。\n3月份，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长7.7%。中泰证券研究所政策组首席分析师杨畅注意到，在去年工业生产基数较高的情况下，今年3月仍然实现了较高增速，表明我国工业生产仍然很强。\n消费、投资、出口被视为拉动经济增长的“三驾马车”，其中，消费是拉动经济增长的“主引擎”。民生银行首席经济学家温彬认为，我国经济开年运行平稳，尽管外需有所放缓，但政策发力对内需形成提振。\n一季度，消费在政策的推动下持续改善。社会消费品零售总额为124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。\n在投资方面，一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）103174亿元，同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1个百分点。扣除房地产开发投资，全国固定资产投资增长8.3%。\n盛来运指出，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心。3月份，制造业采购经理人指数是50.5%，环比上升了0.3个百分点，连续两个月回升。\n一系列政策举措为民营企业投资创造公平的营商环境，民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长。民营企业的活力动力不断显现，一季度制造业中的民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施投资中的民间投资增长9.3%，均比各自领域的平均增速快。\n此外，盛来运表示，一季度GDP同比增长5.4%，增速高于去年全国5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，还高于不少全球主要经济体一季度的经济增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。在全球经济增长乏力的情况下，中国将为世界经济的稳定发挥重要作用。\n高质量发展持续向新向好\n一季度，中国经济在实现“量”的合理增长的同时，新质生产力也在培育壮大，高质量发展向新向好的大势没有改变。\n5个维度反映出这一趋势。盛来运介绍，第一个维度是创新持续推进，新质生产力培育壮大。第二个维度是协调发展持续改善。第三个维度是高水平开放继续推进。第四个维度是绿色转型、绿色发展扎实推进。第五个维度是民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。\n一季度，各地方加大对创新的支持力度，尤其是人工智能、量子科技等一批先进技术不断推出和应用，带动了高技术产业发展。DeepSeek、宇树人形机器人等一批成果的应用，既彰显了中国科技创新的实力，同时也增强了市场的信心。\n新兴产业正在蓬勃发展。一季度，新能源汽车、3D打印设备、工业机器人产品产量同比分别增长45.4%、44.9%、26.0%。\n盛来运指出，一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，这两个数据也显示出我国创新动力在增强。\n工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构来看，当下我国投资增速实际上不高，但是高技术产业投资比重是在提升的。一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资的比重为10.3%，提高0.3个百分点。\n民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。政府高度重视加大民生方面的支出，对民生方面的支出占比持续提高。能源保供有力有效，一季度就业形势总体稳定，城镇调查失业率稳中略降。一季度末，外出务工农村劳动力总量18795万人，同比增长1.1%。\n此外，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%。居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步。一季度，全国居民人均可支配收入12179元，同比名义增长5.5%，扣除价格因素实际增长5.6%。\n安全发展得到加强。作为防风险的重点领域，房地产行业也出现了不少积极变化。1-3月，全国新建商品房销售面积21869万平方米，同比下降3.0%，降幅比1-2月收窄2.1个百分点；新建商品房销售额20798亿元，下降2.1%，降幅收窄0.5个百分点。\n“房地产止跌回稳的态势明显。”广东省城规院住房政策研究中心首席研究员李宇嘉说，一季度，房地产行业从上游开工到下游销售，相关的跌幅明显收窄。\n有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战\n近期，美国“对等关税”风波愈演愈烈。面对冲击，我国外贸韧性依然强劲。今年一季度，我国货物贸易进出口10.3万亿元，同比增长1.3%。其中，出口6.13万亿元，增长6.9%。\n“我们坚决反对美国搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，这种做法损人不利己，违背了经济规律和世界贸易的原则，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击，拖累世界经济复苏。”盛来运表示，中方坚决采取一系列反制措施，不仅是维护自身发展利益的需要，也是维护世界多边贸易体系和世贸组织规则的正当之举。\n谈及加征高额关税对中国的影响，盛来运说：“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，我们有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。”\n盛来运说，中国经济有基础，内需有支撑。中国是世界第二大经济体，连续15年稳居第一制造业大国的地位，产业体系完整、配套能力强，经济发展底盘稳、基础牢。同时，中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均GDP超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。他指出，我国依靠内需和创新驱动共同推动经济增长的新格局正在形成。\n目前，我国已成为150多个国家和地区的重要贸易伙伴，外贸多元化市场格局正在形成，这意味着我国对某一个国家单一出口市场的依存度在下降。盛来运举例，2018年，我国对美国的出口额占出口总额的比重是19.2%，去年已经下降到14.7%。\n针对当前的外部变化，我国应对有经验，并且政策有保障。盛来运谈到，当下，一揽子政策正在发力显效，“下阶段会根据外部形势的变化及时推出增量政策，丰富的政策‘工具箱’是应对外部的冲击和挑战的保障”。\n此外，中国的企业家敢闯敢拼，中国人民智慧勤劳，都是我国应对巨大风险挑战的基础和底气。“我们对中国经济后期的走势以及发展的前景充满信心。”盛来运说。\n中青报·中青网见习记者 赵丽梅 记者 魏婉 来源：中国青年报\n2025年04月17日 01版",

    "title": "El nuevo embajador de Israel en la ONU llama a su colega palestino ‘terrorista con traje’ | La Prensa Panamá",
    "text": "El nuevo embajador israelí ante la [ONU](https://www.prensa.com/tema/onu/), Danny Danon, se estrenó hoy con una intervención ante el Consejo de Seguridad con un ataque frontal contra su colega palestino, Riyad Mansour, al que calificó de “terrorista con traje”. “Señor Mansour -dijo Danon dirigiéndose al palestino, situado a solo un metro de él-, si usted no condena (a Hamás), es uno de ellos. Usted no representa al pueblo palestino. Señor Mansour, usted es un terrorista con traje”, le dijo, mientras el palestino permanecía imperturbable. 'You are a terrorist in a suit’ - Israeli ambassador Danny Danon says Palestinian ambassador Mansour failed to condemn Hamas at least once at the UNSC.— Viory Video (@vioryvideo) [#VioryVideo] [#UN] [#Israel] [#Palestine] [#DannyDanon] [#IsraelHamasConflict] [pic.twitter.com/ReXYXzFLg1] [August 22, 2024] Danon recurrió al ataque personal contra Mansour en varias ocasiones, como cuando dijo: “Veo que el representante de la Autoridad Palestina sigue aquí. Lleva sentado en ese sillón veinte años... Usted ha pasado dos décadas en este sitio proponiendo resoluciones que atizan el caos y la división (pero) no ha conseguido absolutamente nada sino incitar al odio y la violencia mientras clamaba por la paz”. Danon ya fue embajador de Israel ante la ONU entre 2015 y 2020, por lo que ahora repite en el cargo, y había cierta expectación por ver si mantenía el tono belicoso de su predecesor, Gilad Erdan, aficionado a los golpes de efecto, como cuando lució una estrella de David en la solapa (al modo del Holocausto) o cuando sacó una trituradora de papel con la que destruyó la carta fundacional de la ONU. En ese sentido, Danon no defraudó hoy al utilizar su tribuna para atacar no solo a su colega palestino, sino a la ONU en general, a sus agencias y al mismo Consejo de Seguridad, un lugar que según él aprovechan “los actores más viles del mundo para expresar su odio contra los judíos e Israel”. La sesión del consejo de hoy también sirvió al embajador palestino para formular una propuesta muy particular: Mansour invitó al secretario general António Guterres y a los países miembros del Consejo a realizar una visita a Gaza y a apoyar al presidente palestino, Mahmud Abás, en su intención de llevar a cabo tal visita. Para Mansour, una visita de Guterres le permitiría “ver de primera mano los horrores que el pueblo palestino está sufriendo y apoyarlos”, expresó. “Si ustedes -dijo dirigiéndose a todos los miembros del consejo- no van a decidir un alto el fuego, vamos todos juntos a la franja de Gaza y tratemos de imponer ese alto el fuego por parte de nuestros presidentes como líderes mundiales, encabezados por nuestro presidente, el secretario general y el presidente del Consejo de Seguridad”, dijo Mansour. Preguntado posteriormente por la posibilidad de que Guterres viaje a Gaza -estuvo en su frontera sur, pero en la parte egipcia, el pasado marzo-, su portavoz Stéphane Dujarric no lo descartó y recordó que ya ha estado en otros escenarios de guerra, como cuando visitó Kiev en 2023.",

People across Devon were treated to an amazing display of the lights last night with vibrant shades of pink, purple, blue, and green illuminating the sky.\nAlthough the likelihood of seeing the aurora is lower today, the Met Office said there is a chance for people to get a glimpse. The Exeter-based forecaster posted a map on X which shows where and when is best to see the stunning natural phenomenon.\nAccording to the Met Office, Scotland gives the best chance of seeing the Northern Lights tonight. The best time will be at around 10pm.\nThe Met Office said in a post on X: \"Cloudier skies tonight will limit the chances of seeing the #northernlights , however Scotland offers the best chance of seeing the Aurora.\"\nThe Northern Light are caused by activity on the surface of the sun. It is usually only visible in the poles but Met Office forecasters revealed the phenomenon could be seen last night due to a severe solar storm.\nThe forecaster said there have been \"more space weather events in recent months\", including the Northern Lights. This is because the sun is nearing the peak of its solar cycle.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
