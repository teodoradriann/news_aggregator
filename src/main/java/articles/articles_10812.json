    "text": "Wellness\nYou’ve Got Several Sex Hormones. These Tips Will Help Make Them (& Your Sex Life) Stronger.\n2m\nIt’s been said that since, shoot, forever, that the brain is the biggest sex organ that we have — and to a large extent, I would agree. That’s why, whenever I tackle sex issues on this platform, it’s more as it relates to emotional connectedness, effective communication, and clearly articulating one’s needs.\nThat’s not to say that articles like this one aren’t, in some ways, equally as necessary too because sometimes — sometimes, there is absolutely nothing “wrong” with your relationship and still, when you think about having sex with your partner…you’re just not as “into the idea” as you usually are.\nAnd what that could mean is there is something going on physically instead of mentally or emotionally. For example, it could be an indication that one or more of your sex hormones are a bit “off” and you need to get them back where they need to be.\nThat’s the purpose and goal of today’s offering. We’re going to explore how five hormones in your system play a direct role in you having a satisfying sex life, then we’re going to touch on some signs that yours may be low and what you can do about them, at home (although if these don’t work, please see your doctor), if that is indeed the case.\nReady to physically feel like having (more) sex? Awesome.\nUnsplash\nAlthough estrogen is found in both men and women, there is a lot more of it in women. And since drops in estrogen can lead to things like a lower sex drive as well as experiencing challenges when it comes to having orgasms, it’s important to do as much as you can to keep your estrogen levels where they need to be at all times.\nSo, what aresome key indications that your estrogen levels are low? If you have super dry skin; your vagina is dry; you’re storing up more belly fat; your periods are irregular; you’re tired a lot; your sleep patterns are erratic, and/or your libido is low.\nAnd what can you do to get your estrogen levels back on track?\nEat foods that are considered to be phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens are considered to be plant-based sources of estrogen that could help to get your levels up. Those foods include flaxseeds, peaches, berries, sesame seeds, and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and collards).\nTake Vitamin B-Complex. The reason why it’s important to have vitamin B consistently in your system is because it plays a significant role in how your body creates estrogen. So, if you’re not currently taking a B-complex vitamin, this is as good of a time as any.\nLook into Black Cohosh. If you’re someone who likes to take supplements, do some research on black cohosh. It has a pretty good reputation when it comes to elevating estrogen levels.\nDrink some black tea. Are you a tea lover? If so, it can’t hurt to sip on some black tea. Although research is still ongoing, there are findings that state that some of the properties in[ black tea](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5801351/#:~:text=Black%20tea%20and%20D.%20candidum%20extracts%20play,estrogen%20receptor%20%CE%B1%2Ddependent%20signaling%20pathway%20%2D%20PMC.) will help to elevate estrogen levels.\nLive in moderation. Now this might be your “something new” for the day.[ Were you aware of the fact](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7506791/) that estrogen levels actually increase in body fat? In fact,[being underweight](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22354-low-estrogen)is what can decrease your estrogen. While we’re here, exercising too much can jack up your estrogen levels as well. Moral to the story with this one: stay at a healthy weight and don’t overdo it on the workout tip. When it comes to keeping your estrogen levels where they need to be, balance is key.\nGetty Images\n[Testosterone is a hormone](https://www.webmd.com/men/how-low-testosterone-can-affect-your-sex-drive) that stimulates [sexual desire](https://www.xonecole.com/learning-my-desire-type-helped-remove-the-shame-around-having-low-sexual-desire/) in both men[and women](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7098532/#:~:text=Testosterone%20can%20be%20important%20in,%2C%20sexual%20function%2C%20and%20energy.&text=Adequate%20levels%20of%20testosterone%20are,possibly%20vascular%20and%20brain%20function.), although there is significantly more of it in men.[The reason why](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24897-low-testosterone-in-women) women need it in their system is not only does it increase their libido, but it also helps to give them energy, to stay in a good mood, and it can also help to make conceiving easier.\nHow can you know that your testosterone levels could use a boost? If you have an irregular cycle, you’re having trouble conceiving a child; you’re low on energy; your hair is thinning; you’re losing muscle tone; you have trouble sleeping, and/or you have no real interest in sex.\nIf you happen to notice any of these signs, what can you do to get your testosterone levels up?\nExercise. One way to increase your testosterone levels is[ to exercise](https://www.healthline.com/health/does-working-out-increase-testosterone); however, as a woman, the key is to do things like resistance training and[ High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-hiit). Both of those have the reputation for raising testosterone levels; in women, especially.\nConsume more [zinc](https://www.xonecole.com/diy-clear-up-skin). Although it’s been said for years that zinc deficiencies are directly tied to[ erectile dysfunction in men](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/zinc),[ there are also studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34311679/#:~:text=Serum%20zinc%20levels%2C%20testosterone%2C%20hemoglobin,on%20testosterone%20and%20sexual%20function.) that say that many women who are postmenopausal are also low in zinc. In both cases,[ zinc is needed](https://drbrighten.com/low-testosterone-in-women/) because it helps to[ keep hormones in balance](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a43991591/zinc-benefits-for-women/). So, if you sense that you may be low in testosterone, perhaps take a zinc supplement or eat[ foods that are ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-foods-high-in-zinc)[high ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-foods-high-in-zinc)[in](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-foods-high-in-zinc) zinc, like beef, lamb, pumpkin seeds, whole grains, and eggs.\nDrink less alcohol. [Even though alcohol](https://www.xonecole.com/ways-alcohol-can-be-good-for-you/) can make you feel horny for a moment,[ the reality is](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/adb.12589) if you drink too much of it, it can actually cause your testosterone levels to tank. Bottom line with this one, pace yourself with your [cocktails](https://www.xonecole.com/why-were-sipping-on-this-apartment-bartenders-cocktails) — especially if you already know that your testosterone levels aren’t where they should be.\nGo outside. Did you know that[ there is a correlation](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.666687/full) between vitamin D deficiencies and pregnancy issues like preeclampsia and a baby’s low birth weight? There are also studies that indicate that when a woman is receiving a daily dose of vitamin D,[ her testosterone levels](https://www.healio.com/news/endocrinology/20140725/vitamin-d-testosterone-link-in-women-may-explain-reproductive-outcomes) tend to remain strong. That said, one way to get vitamin D into your system is to take a supplement or to eat foods that are rich in them. Another is to consume[ foods that contain vitamin D](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-foods-high-in-vitamin-d), like salmon, tuna, and mushrooms. Still another is to spend more time outside. Definitely one of the best ways to get some “D” into you is to be in the presence of the sun. In fact, as an extra bonus,[ the ultraviolet radiation](https://www.earth.com/news/exposure-to-sunlight-enhances-libido/) that comes from the sun can boost the libido of both men and women. The more you know.\nWatch your stress. Two things that aren’t the best of friends are testosterone and cortisol (the hormone that creates your natural stress response).[ This is so much the case that](https://www.kelsey-seybold.com/your-health-resources/blog/hormonal-imbalance-the-stress-effect) when your [cortisol levels](https://www.xonecole.com/natural-ways-to-lower-cortisol/) are high, that can hinder your system from producing all of the testosterone that it needs. So, you know what that means, right? CHILL. OUT.\nGetty Images\nProgesterone is what helps to[ keep your libido regulated](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4720522/). Since it also plays a pivotal role in a woman’s menstrual cycle and how her hormones respond throughout the month, women who are in[ the latter stages of perimenopause or who are postmenopausal](https://www.hollandhospital.org/news-and-stories/blogs/holland-hospital/goodbye-low-libido-breathing-life-back-into-your-sex-life) should also keep their progesterone levels up in order to maintain a consistent sex life.\n[Signs that you need more progesterone](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24613-low-progesterone)? Trouble sleeping. Irregular cycles. Bloating. Erratic moods. Headaches.\nThings that can help bring some relief to these issues?\nMeditate. From what I’ve[read and (briefly) researched](https://drannagarrett.com/cortisol-connection-perimenopausal-hormone-imbalance/#:~:text=Cortisol%20can%20block%20your%20body's%20progesterone%20receptors.,is%20another%20possible%20reason%20for%20low%20progesterone.), cortisol has the ability to block your progesterone receptors, which means that it can decrease them if you are too [stressed out](https://www.xonecole.com/stressed-out-here-are-10-steps-towards-immediate-calm-tranquility/). And that is why one way that you can boost your progesterone levels is to meditate.[Since meditation](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation) can reduce anxiety, lower stress, and help you to sleep better, I’m sure you get how it can work to get your progesterone levels where they need to be.\nTake Vitamin C. If you are low in vitamin C, it could impact your progesterone levels in a negative way. That’s because[vitamin C is a nutrient](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10574174/) that actually stimulates the production of progesterone. So, if you want to get more of it into your system, take a vitamin C supplement, drink some orange juice, and/or eat[vitamin C-enriched foods](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-foods) like cantaloupe, parsley, strawberries, papaya, and chili peppers.\nImplement chasteberry tea. An herbal tea that I personally think every woman should have in her possession is[chasteberry tea](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/chasteberry-benefits-and-risks). Not only does it do things like reduce inflammation, bring relief to PMS symptoms, and help to improve [infertility](https://www.xonecole.com/tyra-banks-embraces-non-traditional-birthing-options-as-she-welcomes-new-baby-york/), it also helps to balance out your hormones and, yes, increase progesterone levels.\nHang out with friends. When it comes to raising progesterone levels, something that I found to be fascinating is[ that there are studies that say](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33652041/) that when women hang out with each other, that can give their progesterone levels a boost. The methodology is that it reduces stress and anxiety and makes people feel more comfortable, to the point where it helps to balance out that particular hormone. Pretty cool, right?\nGet on a sleep schedule. Not getting a consistent amount (preferably 6-8 hours) of rest can definitely[throw your hormones off](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32882313/), including your progesterone levels. That’s a big part of the reason why I once wrote “[6 Fascinating Ways Sex And Sleep Definitely Go Hand In Hand](https://www.xonecole.com/ways-sex-and-sleep-go-hand-in-hand/).” Check it out when you get a chance.\nGetty Images\nOxytocin has the reputation for being called the “[love hormone](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/09/study-shows-how-love-hormone-spurs-sociability.html#:~:text='Love%20hormone'%20pulls%20the%20strings,sleep%2C%20emotional%20reactions%20and%20more.).” That’s because it’s a hormone (and neuropeptide, which is a protein-like molecule) that “activates” during physical activities like [kissing](https://www.xonecole.com/partner-hates-kissing/?utm_campaign=SmartLinks), cuddling, and[sex](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9949283/#:~:text=Abstract,neuroendocrine%20function%20and%20postcoital%20behavior.).\nAnd what are some telling signs that you are low on this particular hormone?[You may feel a bit depressed](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone);[you may feel more anxious](https://www.amymyersmd.com/blogs/articles/how-to-increase-oxytocin#:~:text=Experts%20say%20oxytocin%20isn't,that%20increased%20oxytocin%20intensifies%20orgasms.); you may notice that you don’t want to communicate and/or be affectionate with others; you may have less of an interest in sex, and/or it may be harder for you to orgasm.\nAre there also things that you can do to increase your oxytocin levels on your own? Yep.\nGet into some music. If you’re not in the mood for sex but you want to be, [treat yourself to a long shower](https://www.xonecole.com/turn-your-shower-into-a-spa/) — and then sing in it. Believe it or not, some studies say that[singing for 30 minutes](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/four_ways_music_strengthens_social_bonds#:~:text=In%20a%20study%20with%20humans,that%20increase%20our%20social%20connection.) can increase your oxytocin because it helps you to feel connected and relaxed (so can listening to music).\nHug someone. There is data all over the place that says that oxytocin is stimulated through the power of touch. That’s a part of the reason why it’s known as the “[cuddle hormone](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22618-oxytocin).” So, just like you can get an oxytocin boost by kissing or cuddling with your partner, hugging a friend can also take your oxytocin levels up a few notches as well.\nGet a massage. Sooo…when’s the last time you got a massage (check out “[12 Different Massage Types. How To Know Which Is Right For You.](https://www.xonecole.com/different-types-of-massages/)”)? Take this as a sign that today would be a great day to book an appointment. As far as your oxytocin levels go,[ it’s another way](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23251939/) that touch can come into effect while reducing stress and inflammation. And don’t get me started on where your oxytocin levels will go if your partner starts rubbing on some of [your pressure points](https://www.xonecole.com/pressure-points-best-sex/). Feel me?\nSpend quality time with your bae. Speaking of partners,[ there are studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3936960/) that also say that oxytocin levels are high when new relationships start. A part of the reason why is that there is so much intentional quality time that’s being spent, which is also good for your oxytocin levels. So, if it’s been a minute since the two of you have been on a date, plan one. Check out “[10 Cheap Date Ideas For Couples On A Budget](https://www.xonecole.com/cheap-date-ideas-couples-on-budget/),” “[15 Date Ideas Based On Your Love Language](https://www.xonecole.com/love-languages-date-ideas/1-try-a-couples-massage),” “[10 Romantic Dates You Can Go On (In Your Own Home)](https://www.xonecole.com/romantic-date-ideas-at-home/)” and “[Dinner & A Movie Is So…“Meh.” Here Are Some Creative Takes On V-Day Dates.](https://www.xonecole.com/unconventional-date-ideas/)” for some inspiration.\nHave sex. As far as physical intimacy goes, it doesn’t get any closer than sex —[ and here’s the thing](https://www.healthline.com/health/love-hormone#:~:text=1.,processing%20of%20bonding%20cues): the more orgasms you have, the more oxytocin your body is able to produce. So, if you want more oxytocin and you’re not having (more) sex (and orgasms), that’s actually working against you… especially as far as this particular hormone goes.\nGetty Images\n[Dopamine](https://www.nature.com/articles/1300580#:~:text=In%20humans%2C%20effects%20of%20dopamine,Meston%20and%20Frohlich%2C%202000).) is a hormone and a neurotransmitter that plays a role in sexual desire and pleasure.[For men](https://www.nature.com/articles/3900719), it can help them to achieve and maintain an erection;[for women](https://www.sdsm.info/female-treatments/dopamine-agonists), it can help them to orgasm (more easily).\n[Some indications](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22588-dopamine-deficiency) that you may need more dopamine in your system are if you find yourself lacking drive and motivation, you struggle with concentrating, you’re moody, sleep is a struggle for you, and/or you don’t find things that you used to enjoy being very fun (including sex).\nLuckily, there are things that you can even do to level out your dopamine:\nConsume more protein. There is[ an amino acid called tyrosine](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-dopamine-5185621#:~:text=Dopamine%20is%20a%20type%20of%20neurotransmitter%20in,body.%20It%20also%20acts%20as%20a%20hormone.) that helps your body to process dopamine. That’s why it’s a good idea to make sure that protein is a part of your diet. Although you can get it from meat, there are other foods that are packed with protein as well. “[Vegetarian Or Vegan? Check Out These High Protein Foods.](https://www.xonecole.com/protein-sources-vegetarian-vegan/)” has a few ideas for you to consider.\nEat less saturated fat. Speaking of your diet, it’s also wise to eat less[ saturated fat](https://www.xonecole.com/7-semi-disturbing-reasons-to-totally-leave-fast-food-alone/). That’s because[ there are studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9351269/) that say that too much of that kind of fat in your system can mess with how your brain processes dopamine.[ For the record](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/saturated-fat#foods), saturated fats include dairy, fried foods, and coconut oil.\nMaintain a healthy gut. It has been stated that more than[ 50 percent of the dopamine that’s in your body](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8234057/#:~:text=More%20than%2050%25%20of%20dopamine,flow%20%5B62%2C63%5D.) is synthesized in your gut. This means that you need to be hypervigilant in making sure that your gut remains as healthy as possible. Check out “[80% Of Your Immunity Is In Your Gut. Take Care Of It Like This.](https://www.xonecole.com/how-to-take-care-of-your-gut/)” for tips on how to do just that.\nTake a probiotic. Speaking of maintaining a healthy gut, it’s going to be so much easier for you to do it if you take a probiotic. Plus,[ probiotics are known for](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8962300/) producing the kind of “good bacteria” that makes it easy for your gut to release dopamine.\nTry some oregano oil.[ A supplement that](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dopamine-supplements) is full of antioxidants and may possibly boost dopamine in your body is oregano oil. Since it also helps to[ keep your gut healthy](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-oregano-oil-benefits-and-uses) — hey, why not give it a shot?\n____\nAs you can see, there are so many factors that go into having a happy, healthy, and fulfilling sex life. Now that you know more about what to do for your sex-related hormones, hopefully, you can get more of what you’re looking for in your sexual experiences.\nAmen?

The [model-turned-actress](https://www.xonecole.com/eva-marcille-is-going-from-hollywood-to-real-estate-in-new-bet-docu-series-about-the-business/) is starring in her first play, Jason’s Lyric Live alongside Allen Payne, [K. Michelle](https://www.xonecole.com/k-michelle-regrets-her-butt-job/), Treach, and others.\nThe play, produced by Je’Caryous Johnson, is an adaptation of the film, which starred Allen Payne as Jason and [Jada Pinkett Smith](https://www.xonecole.com/jada-pinkett-smith-authenticity-worthy/) as Lyric. Allen reprised his role as Jason for the play and Eva plays Lyric.\nWhile speaking to xoNecole, Eva shares that she’s a lot like the beloved 1994 character in many ways. “Lyric is so me. She's the odd flower. A flower nonetheless, but definitely not a peony,” she tells us.\n“She's not the average flower you see presented, and so she reminds me of myself. I'm a sunflower, beautiful, but different. And what I loved about her character then, and even more so now, is that she was very sure of herself.\n\"Sure of what she wanted in life and okay to sacrifice her moments right now, to get what she knew she deserved later. And that is me. I'm not an [instant gratification](https://www.xonecole.com/power-letting-go-need-control/) kind of a person. I am a long game. I'm not a sprinter, I'm a marathon.\nAmerica first fell in love with Eva when she graced our screens on cycle 3 of [America’s Next Top Model ](https://www.xonecole.com/bianca-golden-americas-next-top-model/)in 2004, which she emerged as the winner. Since then, she's ventured into different avenues, from acting on various TV series like House of Payne to starring on [Real Housewives of Atlanta](https://www.xonecole.com/tanya-sam-nursing-to-tech/).\nJe-Caryous Johnson Entertainment\nEva praises her castmates and the play’s producer, Je’Caryous for her positive experience. “You know what? Je’Caryous fuels my audacity car daily, ‘cause I consider myself an extremely [audacious](https://www.xonecole.com/how-to-move-from-ambitious-to-audacious-in-2019/) woman, and I believe in what I know, even if no one else knows it, because God gave it to me. So I know what I know. That is who Je’Caryous is.”\nBut the mom of three isn’t the only one in the family who enjoys acting. Eva reveals her daughter [Marley](https://www.xonecole.com/eva-marcille-change-her-daughter-name/) has also caught the acting bug.\n“It is the most adorable thing you can ever see. She’s got a part in her school play. She's in her chorus, and she loves it,” she says. “I don't know if she loves it, because it's like, mommy does it, so maybe I should do it, but there is something about her.”\nOverall, Eva hopes that her contribution to the role and the play as a whole serves as [motivation](https://www.xonecole.com/black-woman-motivational-speech/) for others to reach for the stars.\n“I want them to walk out with hope. I want them to re-vision their dreams. Whatever they were. Whatever they are. To re-see them and then have that thing inside of them say, ‘You know what? I'm going to do that. Whatever dream you put on the back burner, go pick it up.\n\"Whatever dream you've accomplished, make a new dream, but continue to reach for the stars. Continue to reach for what is beyond what people say we can do, especially as [a] Black collective but especially as [Black women](https://www.xonecole.com/let-us-take-the-lead-blackwomen-should-always-be-trending/). When it comes to us and who we are and what we accept and what we're worth, it's not about having seen it before. It's about knowing that I deserve it.”\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nFeature image by Leon Bennett/WireImage\n[Mother's Day](https://www.xonecole.com/push-gift-ideas-for-mom/) is approaching, and if you're looking for a unique way to celebrate, why not surprise her with a mother-daughter trip?

There are numerous destinations that cater to both of your interests and foster bonding experiences. Explore our top five mother-daughter vacation spots below.\nPeathegee Inc/ Getty Images\nThere's no better way to bond than over a shared meal and Marriott Puerto Vallarta Resort & Spa offers an unparalleled dining experience for a mother-daughter trip. The resort boasts Jalisco style ceviche making classes, a Japanese teppanyaki house right on the beach, and it recently launched ‘Las Recetas de la Abuela’ (Grandma’s [Recipes](https://www.xonecole.com/slow-cooker-recipes-make-life-simpler/).)\nLas Recetas de la Abuela is a [private dining experience](https://www.xonecole.com/this-private-chef-is-giving-us-the-secret-to-curating-the-perfect-summer-supper-moment/) where guests can enjoy the Executive Chef's abuela’s recipes and the heartfelt stories behind them.\nMusic is known for bringing people together and that's why Grand Universe Lucca is a great stay for music-loving mother and daughter. [Lucca](https://www.xonecole.com/girls-trip-for-every-friend-group/), steeped in classical music and opera heritage, offers a unique experience for music enthusiasts. During your stay, immerse yourself in the hotel’s Symphony Lounge, where the resident composer creates a personalized musical prelude, drawing inspiration from your personalities and life stories.\nAdditionally, don’t miss the city’s renowned Lucca Summer Festival, where world-class artists grace the stage each year, showcasing their talents to the local community.\nSabrina Bracher/ Getty Images\n[Wellness](https://www.xonecole.com/level-up-with-the-3-pillars-of-wellness/) is crucial regardless of age, so why not bond over it? Ocean Edge Resort & Golf Club announced its Mother's Day Restorative Yoga [Retreat](https://www.xonecole.com/travel-burnout-tips/), an exclusive opportunity for mothers and daughters to unwind and rejuvenate together.

For the active duo, these trails provide perfect avenues for exhilarating bike rides and leisurely beach walks. Alternatively, if [relaxation](https://www.xonecole.com/detox-baths-relaxation) is your preference, indulge in a day of [pampering](https://www.xonecole.com/valentine-s-day-self-love/) at the resort’s renowned spa.\nGet your boots on the ground and visit Rusty Parrot Lodge & Spa in Jackson Hole, WY. This resort is situated near two national parks that give picturesque views of the mountains and offers a range of activities, including their critically acclaimed spa.\nAfter you and your mom complete your hydrating [facials](https://www.xonecole.com/facial-massage/) and restorative massages, head to Wild Sage Restaurant, where you two can indulge in local and seasonal dishes. Lastly, to complete your cowgirl experience, end the night at the iconic Million Dollar Cowboy Bar.\nGolser/ Getty Images\nThe girls love to shop and if you and your mom love to tear the mall down, then try planning a mother-daughter trip at the shopping capital of the Pacific Northwest. Bellevue, Washington has a variety of shopping experiences from luxury goods like Gucci and Hermès to local speciality boutiques.\nWhile you’re on your shopping spree, don’t forget to take a break and admire the breathtaking views of the mountains. After a day of shopping, treat yourselves to a delicious meal at Ascend Prime Steak & Sushi and [Oprah](https://www.xonecole.com/the-real-reason-oprah-doesnt-take-sh-t-from-anyone/)’s favorite chocolate store, Fran’s to indulge in some sweet treats.\nFeature image by Carlos Barquero/ Getty Images",

    "title": "Surf's up: Big waves pound US West Coast",
    "text": "Huge surf is battering the US West Coast, with rogue waves already sweeping away pedestrians and vehicles and inundating a hotel, and forecasters warning of more danger ahead for beach communities. Rollers as high as 30 feet (9 meters) were expected to lash parts of California and Oregon as a powerful storm capped a year of wild -- and often wet -- weather for the region. Just north of Los Angeles, Ventura County took a walloping on Thursday, with several people hurt. Video footage showed the dramatic moment a rogue wave overtopped a sea wall in Ventura city, knocking several bystanders off their feet and sending others scurrying for safety. \"Because of this wave eight people were transported to local hospitals,\" Ventura County Fire wrote on social media. The Los Angeles Times reported the nearby Inn on the Beach boutique hotel was inundated with two feet of water, with the waves smashing glass and tossing furniture around. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned of \"extremely dangerous conditions,\" and noted that \"powerful waves and life-threatening rip currents pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal structures.\" Forecasters said high surf was anticipated all along the coast, with some flooding possible through Saturday evening. \"Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as parking lots, beaches, and walkways,\" the NWS said. While weather watchers were not expecting major damage, they warned the sea would be very dangerous. \"There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea,\" the NWS said. \"Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.\" The waves were being generated by a storm that was also bringing heavy rain to areas further inland, as well as the chance of a decent snowfall over the Sierra Nevada during the weekend. The storm is the latest episode in a year of wild weather in the US West, which was hit by a fierce heatwave in July. That came after one of the wettest winters on record. A series of atmospheric rivers -- high altitude ribbons of moisture -- chugged in, dropping trillions of gallons of water on a landscape that had been baked dry by years of punishing drought. Reservoirs that had been perilously low drank their fill, and rivers burst their banks. Scientists say that as humanity continues to warm the planet by burning fossil fuels, the weather patterns we have known for generations will become more unpredictable. That will mean wetter and more powerful storms, along with hotter, drier periods that will strain our water resources.",
