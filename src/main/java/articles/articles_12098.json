    "title": "Radon gas Spain: Second highest cause of lung cancer",
    "text": "Radon gas in Spain is the second highest cause of lung cancer. Invisible, odourless, and absolutely deadly, it causes more lung cancer than asbestos. The gas seeping into Spanish homes and schools. But, how do levels stack up against the rest of Europe? An invisible killer is creeping into Spanish homes, schools, and workplaces without a whisper. Radon gas, a colourless, odourless, and tasteless radioactive gas, is causing alarm across the nation as experts warn of its deadly link to lung cancer. What exactly is radon? Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil. You can’t see it, smell it, or taste it, but it’s everywhere beneath our feet. When radon escapes from the ground into the open air, it’s harmless. But when it seeps into buildings and accumulates, it becomes a silent threat. Even if you’ve never touched a cigarette, high levels of radon exposure can double your risk of lung cancer. That’s right- double. The World Health Organisation estimates that radon is responsible for up to 14% of lung cancer cases globally. Smokers are at even greater risk, with radon acting as the silent partner in a deadly duo. In Spain, radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after tobacco. Radon gas – the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking – is lurking in our homes, yet governments and media seem to avoid talking about it. Is this invisible assassin being swept under the carpet? It’s hard to say, but it appears to be a bit of a can of worms, as it’s quite difficult to stop and would require a mammoth investment. Hard to see, smell, or taste, radon’s stealth makes it easy to overlook. Tackling this silent threat isn’t cheap, and with politicians wary of the hefty price tag for testing and fixing the problem, it often gets left off the agenda or pushed back. Plus, with news outlets chasing the next big crisis, a slow-building health hazard like radon doesn’t make the front page. But there are lives at stake here, many lives. While Spain has been grabbing headlines for its radon woes, this invisible killer doesn’t recognise borders. Across Europe, many countries are grappling with high radon levels. The UK, for instance, has its own radon hotspots, particularly in areas with granite bedrock like Cornwall and Devon. Spain does have regions with elevated radon levels, especially in Galicia and parts of Valencia, due to their unique geological formations. However, when we stack up the numbers, other European countries often report higher average indoor radon levels. Ireland: Ireland reports some of the highest indoor radon radiation levels in Europe, specifically in homes and workplaces. Czech Republic: Known for some of the highest radon concentrations in Europe. Finland and Sweden: Cold climates and specific soil types contribute to elevated indoor radon levels. Finland and Sweden are radon hotspots. Germany and Austria: Certain regions have significant radon presence due to their geology. So, while Spain faces serious challenges, it’s not alone – and in some cases, not even the worst off. It sits around mid-table in the radon list. Don’t think the UK’s off the hook. Public Health England estimates that radon is responsible for over 1,100 lung cancer deaths each year in the UK. High radon areas are well-documented, and efforts are ongoing to test and mitigate radon levels in homes and workplaces. The picturesque region of Galicia, famed for its rolling green hills and rugged coastline, is now under a cloud of concern. Thanks to its geological makeup, Galicia tops the charts as Spain’s most radon-prone area. Similarly, several towns in Valencia – including Puçol, Gilet, Torrent, and Chera – are feeling the heat, with radon levels soaring above the safety limits of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m³). Even amongst never-smokers, residential radon gas seems to double the risk of lung cancer in those exposed to ≥200 Bq·m−3 according to scientific studies published by the European Respiratory Society. According to the Nuclear Safety Council’s map of radon potential, areas are categorised based on their radon levels, identifying zones where a significant percentage of buildings exceed 300 Bq/m³. In these hotspots, 10% of buildings have radon concentrations above this level, putting residents at risk. In a shocking twist, a recent study measuring radon levels in 3,140 workplaces across Spain has revealed that one in five exceeds the danger threshold of 300 Bq/m³. The highest concentrations were found in the Education and Culture sector- schools, universities, libraries, and cultural centres. Researchers found that median radon levels in radon-prone areas hit 107 Bq/m³, compared to just 28 Bq/m³ elsewhere. Alarmingly, excessive radon levels were detected on all floor levels, not just basements. In response to this gas threat, the Spanish Ministry of Health has rolled out a National Radon Plan aimed at detecting and reducing radon exposure. Galicia’s government isn’t holding its breath either, launching the ‘Reduce Radon’ initiative to tackle this public health hazard head-on. The plan includes: An interdepartmental commission and a Technical Office for Radon Control will coordinate these efforts, ensuring that radon doesn’t continue to fly under the radar. So, while it’s not being publicised, some work is definitely being done to tackle it. However – and this applies to the whole of Europe – is it enough, or are they silently covering their own backs with these initiatives? Testing your home or workplace for radon is the first step towards safety. Simple and affordable radon detectors are available, and if high levels are found, there are effective measures you can take to stop it or at least minimise it. Increasing ventilation, sealing cracks and gaps, and installing radon sumps can significantly reduce radon levels. Some experts are urging immediate action to protect workers and the public against radon exposure. Relatively new EU regulations make radon testing mandatory in certain areas, and employers are now responsible for addressing this risk and communicating with their workers. Spain’s radon problem is a wake-up call that what we can’t see can indeed hurt us. With government initiatives gaining momentum, there’s hope that radon will no longer be an underground issue. It’s time to bring this silent killer into the spotlight, take a deep breath, and tackle it together. Can we halt radon in its tracks? Absolutely. While we can’t banish this sneaky gas from the earth (at the moment), we can stop it from invading our homes. By sealing up cracks in floors and walls, improving ventilation, and installing specialised radon sumps, you can dramatically reduce radon levels indoors. Don’t let this silent intruder put your health at risk- take action now and give radon the boot. Get more news from around Europe. Find more Spanish news stories in English.

    "title": "Assailant takes hostages in Gaza protest near Istanbul",
    "text": "An armed man on Thursday took a group of Turkish workers hostage at a plant near Istanbul owned by US consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble in protest at the war in Gaza. A union representing the sprawling complex on the industrial eastern outskirts of Turkey's largest city said the man was holding seven people after allowing the others to escape. A police spokesman could not confirm the figure to AFP and the US embassy in Ankara referred all queries to Turkish officials. \"Earlier today, we evacuated our Gebze facility and are working with local authorities to resolve an urgent security situation,\" P&G said in a statement released to AFP. Photos and videos of the assailant shared online by one of the hostages and verified by AFP showed a man -- his face hidden by a Palestinian scarf -- holding a gun with what appeared to be a suicide vest strapped to his chest. He was standing next to a drawing of the Palestinian flag and the words \"the door will be opened for Gaza\" painted on the wall in red. Haberturk television said police had established contact with the assailant and were attempting to negotiate the hostages' release. AFP reporters saw anti-riot police moving closer to the plant as the crisis stretched into the night. - 'I can only pray' - Relatives of the hostages questioned why the assailant would target workers in Turkey -- a country strongly supportive of the Palestinian cause -- to show his solidarity with the people of Gaza. \"He supposedly does this for Islam, but they are the ones who harm Islam the most,\" Sedat Degirmenci, whose son-in-law was taken hostage, told AFP. \"If you do this for Palestine, go and fight there,\" added Cigdem Aydemir, the mother of a 26-year-old woman taken hostage at the plant. Like other relatives, Aydemir was following the hostage-taker's Instagram account for updates about the situation. The account became inaccessible by Thursday evening. \"What does my daughter have to do with this?\" said Aydemir. \"I can only pray.\" The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Militants also seized about 250 hostages. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, including at least 29 people who are believed to have been killed. Following the deadliest attack in Israel's history, its military launched an offensive on Gaza. It has killed at least 27,019 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. - Erdogan criticism - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has emerged as one of the Muslim world's harshest critics of Israel because of the massive civilian death toll from its campaign against Hamas militants. He has branded Israel a \"terrorist state\" and compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler. Erdogan has also accused the United States of supporting \"genocide\" in Gaza. Erdogan's comments reflect widespread anger across the predominantly Muslim but officially secular country at the United States for its traditional support for Israel. Hundreds of protesters stormed a southeastern Turkish air base used by US and British forces on the eve of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Ankara in November. Turkish online campaigns are also trying to organise boycotts of US products such as Coca-Cola and the coffee chain Starbucks. fo/zak/bc",

    "text": "CHRISTCHURCH: Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips combined to steer New Zealand to a seven-wicket win over Pakistan in the fourth Twenty20 international in Christchurch on Friday, placing them on the verge of a series clean sweep.\nThe Black Caps pair scored unbeaten half-centuries in a 139-run stand as the home side reached 159-3 in the 19th over in response to Pakistan’s 158-5.\nThey were forced to mount a rearguard action after Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi knocked over New Zealand’s top order, reducing them to 3-20 in the third over.\nMitchell scored 72 off 44 balls and Phillips 70 off 52, accelerating over the closing stages to complete victory with 11 balls to spare, having begun their partnership in a cautious fashion.\nBig-hitting allrounder Mitchell said the first priority was seeing off the immediate threat of Afridi, before the pair set themselves targets.\n“The way Shaheen swung it up top made it challenging so we had to take it as deep as we could,” Mitchell said.\n New Zealand’s Conway misses T20 match v Pakistan due to COVID\n“It’s about biding your time and building a partnership through to that 10-12 over mark and then keep trying to put pressure on them.\n“We have different strengths and like to hit the ball to different areas, it’s good fun batting with him.”\nNew Zealand can wrap up the series 5-0 in Sunday’s final match at the same Hagley Oval venue.\nPakistan paid for their inability to support opening batter Mohammad Rizwan, who crafted an unbeaten 90 off 63 balls to dominate his side’s innings.\nRizwan found ways to keep the score ticking over against a disciplined New Zealand attack, led by seamers Matt Henry (2-22) and Lockie Ferguson (2-27).\nThe 31-year-old at times threatened to reach his second T20 international century in an innings that featured a relatively low percentage of boundaries: six fours and two sixes.\nAllrounder Mohammad Nawaz was the only other player to surpass 20 runs, whacking pace bowler Adam Milne for three successive sixes in his final over to post 21 off nine balls.\nBabar Azam, who scored half-centuries in each of the first three games, fell for 19 when he skied an attempted pull off Milne in the seventh over.\nPace bowler Afridi had Pakistan right in the contest when he knocked over Finn Allen, Tim Seifert and Will Young cheaply and finished with figures of 3-34.\nAllen’s wicket was particularly cherished following the opener’s sensational 137 in game three on Wednesday.\nHowever, Mitchell and Phillips gradually pulled momentum back in New Zealand’s favour and Pakistan potentially blew their last chance at victory when Sahibzada Farhan dropped a straightforward chance in the deep offered by Mitchell in the 14th over.\nAfridi said a good score would have been 170 and believed Pakistan shortcomings were then exposed in the field after his own lethal opening spell.\n“The way we started was very good but unfortunately again in the middle overs we didn’t grab our opportunities,” Afridi said.\nNew Zealand chase down Pakistan to win fourth T20 international\nIntra-day update: rupee sees some gain against US dollar\nKSE-100 loses grip on early gains, as profit-taking kicks in\nIsrael\n ",

    "text": "Recommended Stories\nEven though there has been some respite from extreme cold conditions, normal life continues to be affected in some parts of Odisha owing to dense fog, especially during early morning hours.\nThe people in several parts of the state experienced dense fog on Friday. A thick blanket of fog created problems for the commuters and early office-goers in different districts. Normal life was also affected in the Twin Cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar as well. Especially, the movement of vehicular traffic on the outskirts of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar and other patches was affected due to dense fog.\nEarlier, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted there would be no large change in the minimum temperature (Night temperature) over the districts of Odisha during the next five days.\nAs per IMD, the minimum temperature is likely to be above normal by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius at many places over the districts of Odisha during the next five days. The IMD has also issued a yellow warning for dense fog in several districts of the state.\nForecast\nDay 2 (Valid from 0830 hrs IST of 29.12.2023 to 0830 hrs IST of 30.12.2023)\nYellow Warning: Dense fog is very likely to occur at one or two places over the districts of Puri, Khordha, Nayagarh, Ganjam, Gajapati, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Sundergarh, Deogarh, Angul, Boudh, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Koraput.\nDay 3 (Valid from 0830 hrs IST of 30.12.2023 to 0830 hrs IST of 31.12.2023)\nYellow Warning: Dense fog is very likely to occur at one or two places over the districts of Koraput, Nabarangpur, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Boudh, Bolangir, Sonepur, Bargarh, Jharsuguda, Keonjhar, Sundargarh.",

    "title": "Phil Spencer critica PS5 Pro: \\\"Il mercato non può crescere con console da 1000 dollari\\\"",
    "text": "Phil Spencer, CEO di Microsoft Gaming, ha criticato indirettamente PS5 Pro [durante un'intervista con Bloomberg](https://www.tomshw.it/videogioco/microsoft-cerca-nuove-acquisizioni-nel-gaming-2024-11-13). Spencer ha dichiarato che Microsoft non farà crescere il mercato con \"console da mille dollari\", riferendosi alla strategia di Sony per la nuova versione di PlayStation 5. Le parole di Spencer sottolineano la diversa visione strategica tra Microsoft e Sony nel settore videoludico. Mentre Sony punta su hardware più potenti e costosi, Microsoft sembra orientata verso soluzioni più accessibili e innovative per raggiungere nuovi giocatori. Il CEO di Microsoft Gaming ha enfatizzato la necessità di adattarsi a nuovi modelli di business, dispositivi e modi di accedere alle esperienze di gioco. Questa visione si contrappone all'approccio di Sony, che con PS5 Pro sembra rivolgersi a un mercato più di nicchia e potenzialmente elitario. La mancanza di concorrenza diretta nel segmento delle console mid-gen potrebbe aver influenzato la decisione di Sony sul prezzo di PS5 Pro. Microsoft, d'altra parte, sembra concentrarsi su strategie alternative per espandere il proprio pubblico. Nonostante le critiche velate alla concorrenza, non si conoscono ancora i piani di Microsoft per il futuro dell'hardware Xbox. Alcune voci suggeriscono il lancio della prossima generazione di console nel 2026, anticipando PS6 e puntando su un prezzo competitivo. Questa mossa potrebbe ricordare l'approccio vincente di Xbox 360, che conquistò una buona fetta di mercato grazie al suo lancio anticipato nel dicembre del 2005. Tuttavia, [la recente campagna](https://www.tomshw.it/videogioco/xbox-la-nuova-campagna-marketing-specifica-che-xbox-e-qualsiasi-dispositivo) pubblicitaria di Microsoft sembra sminuire l'importanza dell'hardware a favore di altri aspetti dell'ecosistema Xbox, come la possibilità di videogiocare su qualsiasi dispositivo che possiede effettivamente una app Xbox. In ogni caso anche Microsoft è consapevole che console come Xbox Series X ([console acquistabile su amazon](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B08JDSW1ZW/?tag=gdivision-21&ascsubtag=11951&linkCode=ogi)) o S siano ancora importanti per espandere il proprio pubblico e soprattutto i propri abbonamenti, anche se chiaramente non vendendole a 1000 dollari ciascuna.",

    "text": "By James Reynolds and Sabrina Penty and Mike Keegan In Paris\nPublished: 19:53 BST, 25 July 2024 | Updated: 19:54 BST, 25 July 2024\nAdvertisement\nTeam GB has had to fly out an extra emergency chef to the Paris Olympics to help cater for star athletes amid mounting complaints of food shortages and uncooked meat spoiling the atmosphere in the Olympic Village. ‘Our athletes have decided they would rather go and eat in our performance lodge in Clichy, so we are having to get another chef to come over as the demand is far exceeding what we thought it would be,’ Andy Anson, chief exec of the British Olympic Association told The Times.\nOlympians promised cuisine designed by Michelin-starred chefs have lamented the food on offer as British athletes resort to taking packed lunches back to the village for their evening meal with just one day to go until the opening ceremony. Mr. Anson told the newspaper there are ‘usually two or three issues’ at the start of every Games, but the food in France is proving a major problem in the camp.\n‘There are not enough of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates. And then there is the quality of the food, with raw meat being served to athletes,’ he said. ‘They have got to improve it over the next couple of days dramatically’. The Olympic Village’s catering partner, Sodexo Live!, said it had taken feedback from athletes ‘seriously’, noting that volumes will be increased to ‘satisfy the needs of the athletes’ after noticing a ‘very high demand for certain products’.\nThe Carrefour group, which is responsible for sourcing 600 tonnes of fresh produce for the Olympics , confirmed that in light of ‘the initial assessments of the meals consumed, it has been requested to revise upwards the quantities initially planned, which the group will be able to satisfy.’ In recent days, many Olympians have claimed that the amount of food available in the canteen of the Village is insufficient, French newspaper L’Equipe reported, just six days after it opened to competitors.\nEggs and grilled meats reportedly had to be rationed on Wednesday during the breakfast service. British athletes are now reportedly boycotting the restaurants set up for them because of concern about both the quality and quantity on offer. Although the problem has been mitigated somewhat given the island location of Team GB’s base, which affords them access to a smaller, less-populated restaurant.\nThe event’s food service is gearing up to serve more than 13 million meals in the next month, with some 15,000 international athletes from 208 different territories arriving for the start of the Games on Friday. France had boasted that Michelin-starred chefs would be designing dishes for the athletes living in the Village between now and August 11.\nAmandine Chaignot, Alexandre Mazzia and Akrame Benallal are among the top French chefs who have helped to craft the menu offered at a 3,500 seat restaurant in the Olympic village. There are also salad bars, fruit stalls, a cheese stand, desserts, soups, daily specials and a buffet alongside the more classically French offerings.\nAround 80 percent of the food will be from France – and 100 percent of the meat has been sourced from French suppliers. The International Olympic Committee had mandated the food must be local, primarily plant-based, and focused on minimal waste. Pictured: Executive chef for the Olympic Village of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Charles Guilloy from Sodexo Live!, poses in Rungis, near Paris.\nNearly two-thirds of the 500 dishes on offer will be vegetarian, including meat-free options like beefless bourguignon and ‘not-dogs’, a meatless option featuring onions and pickled cabbage with honey-mustard sauce. Leftovers will be redistributed to those in need, and used coffee grinds will be repurposed for fertilisation. The sustainable menu aims to meet the diverse cultural, religious and nutritional needs of athletes while showcasing French gastronomy.\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

    "title": "Amazon, H&M, Macy's, and others add fees to online shopping returns",
    "text": "Returning unwanted gifts isn’t as easy as it used to be—or at least not as cheap. An increasing number of retailers—including Abercrombie, H&M, J.Crew, and Macy’s—are now charging customers who return purchased items, [CNN’s Nathaniel Meyersohn reports](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/26/business/returns-shopping-gifts-charge/index.html). It’s an obvious way to reduce the impact returns have on their bottom line. For online sellers, returns are expensive. Not only do they often eat the cost of shipping back an unwanted item, but they also often have to resell that item at a discount to another customer or end up taking a loss on it. That’s not even accounting for the resources needed to process returns. According to [data from the National Retail Federation](https://cdn.nrf.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/AR3021-Customer%20Returns%20in%20the%20Retail%20Industry_2022_Final.pdf), customers sent back almost 17% of the total merchandise they purchased last year, including 17.9% of holiday purchases. As a result, 44% of companies said they planned to hire additional seasonal staff to help process those returns. Free returns were originally offered for online purchases as a way to give consumers confidence about a new form of shopping. But now that a substantial amount of commerce happens online, many retailers are rethinking the practice. According to [Happy Returns](https://happyreturns.com/), a UPS-owned company that specializes in returns, a whopping 81% of merchants are currently charging customers for making at least some kinds of returns. Amazon, for instance, charges customers $1 who choose to return items to a UPS Store when there is a Whole Foods, Kohl’s, or Amazon Fresh grocery store closer to their location. The company has also started adding a badge to the listing for frequently returned products to help customers avoid them in the first place. Other companies have started charging customers for return shipping or charging restocking fees to help offset the cost of taking back goods. Total returns in 2022 equaled $816 billion in lost sales for U.S. retailers. For every $1 billion in sales, the average retailer will incur $165 million in merchandise returns. Those free returns are also having [a significant environmental impact](https://www.fastcompany.com/90926478/free-returns-environmental-impact-retailer-sustainable-solutions). In addition to the obvious carbon impact of transporting the goods back to the store or warehouse, some of those returned items also end up in landfills. That’s led some companies to even provide refunds for items without asking for the item back, suggesting that the buyer instead pass it along to someone who could use it. The pet retailer Chewy, for instance, often suggests buyers donate items to their local rescue for another pet to enjoy rather than send them back, and even [Temu](https://www.fastcompany.com/90851736/what-is-temu-selling-super-bowl-ad), which offers free returns, has often allowed customers to keep unwanted items rather than taking on the cost of their return. Last November alone, [customers spent $63.2 billion online](https://www.fastcompany.com/90987998/black-friday-increase-online-shopping-2023). All that buying undoubtedly led to a lot of returns. But in the case of returns that had a fee attached, maybe some gift recipients decided to wear that sweater from grandma after all.",
