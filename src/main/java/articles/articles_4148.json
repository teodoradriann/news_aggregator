    "text": "NEW YORK — Before Darryl Strawberry became the toast of New York City and won a World Series, before the substance abuse and well before the Mets announced that they would retire his number 18 on Saturday at Citi Field, he was a kid in South Central Los Angeles. Strawberry grew up in a neighborhood in decline. The freeway system divided along traditional segregation lines, and the area felt the effects of eliminating manufacturing jobs in the 1970s, when Strawberry was playing baseball and basketball on the city’s courts and diamonds. Sports were a chance for kids in the inner cities to get out of town and break the cycle of poverty and gangs. “Coming from the inner city, you played with all Black players,” Strawberry said recently on a Zoom call. “You never played with people of any other color. And that was a big thing. We played against other players — white players — but we’ve never had white teammates.” The 1979 Crenshaw High School baseball team was the stuff of lore. They reached the City Championship at Dodger Stadium, where they lost to a Granada Hills team with a third baseman you might have heard of — John Elway. For years, it was considered one of the best teams the state had ever seen. Nine players were drafted by major league teams, including Strawberry, who was drafted first overall in 1980. He was compared to Ted Williams in a “Sports Illustrated” article shortly before he was drafted. “I was like, ‘Who the heck is Ted Williams?' ” Strawberry said. “The only baseball that I followed growing up was the Dodgers because I grew up in L.A. It was the Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds.” Strawberry, the prolific former Mets outfielder with the distinctive leg kick at the plate, got his ticket out of town and a one-way ticket to success. He became an eight-time All-Star, part of three World Series-winning teams and a two-time Silver Slugger who led the NL in home runs in 1988. But along with former pitcher Dwight “Doc” Gooden, Strawberry also became a cautionary tale. Drugs, alcohol and domestic violence took hold of him, rewriting the narrative of his career. He wasn’t the only member of that 1979 team to have served time as catcher Carl Jones ended up in Folsom Prison. Sports might be a ticket out of the hood, but at what cost does it come? Strawberry paid the cost with his freedom and his health. Through hard work and spiritual guidance, he turned it all around. He didn’t rewrite the narrative; he wrote newer, healthier, sober chapters. Strawberry’s current chapter is as a speaker with the ministry founded by him and his wife, Tracy. It’s a legacy he’s leaving behind that’s bigger than baseball and bigger than him. “He speaks at churches, he speeds out rehabilitation centers, he speaks at schools,” his niece, Michelle Strawberry, told the New York Daily News. “Everything is different, and everything is kind of tailored towards what he’s booked for.” The common theme in all of his speeches is hope. “Darryl’s message resonates with everyone — regardless of their faith background — because so many are utterly defeated and bereft of hope,” said his friend Mark Vernarelli. “He reminds them that there is hope.” Vernarelli is the media relations manager for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, a former news reporter and play-by-play announcer. He followed Strawberry’s rise through the minor leagues and the major leagues and followed his fall. He thought he would be a perfect person to speak to prison inmates. “We always try to bring in programs, services and people who can help the incarcerated turn their lives around,” Vernarelli said. “Knowing Darryl’s transformation and the troubles he has overcome, I thought he’d be a great person to visit the incarcerated and offer hope.” Strawberry visited four Western Maryland prisons in 2015 with Vernarelli saying the men were “mesmerized” by Strawberry’s message. Michelle, who schedules his travel and speaking engagements, has seen the same reactions at other events. “The response is unbelievable,” Michelle said. “When I’m not there, they always say he’s the best speaker. He’s the most humble, the most gracious, the most giving with his time.” To Mets fans, Strawberry is a hero. To convicts, he’s a positive influence. To addicts, he’s an inspiration. But to Michelle, the daughter of his brother Michael, a former minor leaguer, he’s just “Uncle Darryl,” a down-to-earth family man who treats everyone the same, whether it’s a billionaire like Mets owner Steve Cohen or an addict in need of encouragement. This is part of his charm and charisma. “I think it’s just his upbringing,” Michelle said. “It was the way he grew up. And I feel like he’s just always been a people person. People always obviously looked up to him, but he was always just a people person. I think he’s humble because of everything that he’s been through and where he’s at now.” Where he’s at now is on the road. Michelle estimates that Strawberry is on the road about 150 days a year. Recently, she has taken her four kids, ages 9, 7, 4 and 2, on the road for speaking engagements. A joint calendar helps the family keep up, but don’t ask her how she manages her uncle’s schedule with four kids because even she doesn’t know. All she knows is that it’s enjoyable and worthwhile. “To be honest, I have no idea,” she said. “I just get it done. He’s so busy, it’s like, insane how much he travels, And I don’t know how to keep up with it all. But I do.” Strawberry and Tracy asked her to come aboard when they created Strawberry Ministries. It was a no-brainer. Michelle, based in Orange County, Calif., remembers watching Strawberry play baseball as a kid, handing him balls so he could autograph them and toss them to kids over the fence. Even at the height of his fame, he was still her humble uncle. Recently, they traveled to Kingsport, Tenn., where Strawberry played his first season in the minor leagues. At the time, the kid from Crenshaw wasn’t ready for what he experienced there — being without his family, white teammates, racism and … wood bats. “Can you imagine what the culture shock of it was coming from South Central L.A. to Kingsport, Tennessee? I was like, ‘Where the heck am I? I’m in the middle of nowhere and I’ve got to play baseball — now I got to use a wood bat too?'” Strawberry’s inner-city childhood may not have prepared him for fame and fortune in New York, but it made him who is today. Through all of the trophies, trials and dark moments, Strawberry became more than a cautionary tale, he became a success story. The Mets are an important part of that story for him, just as he’s an important part of the club’s success. “I played in other places, but no place like Shea Stadium,” he said. “Nothing on the planet like Shea Stadium, nothing like that curtain call, nothing like who we were as a team.” An honor like this for a player like Strawberry is a lifetime achievement award of sorts. No longer burdened by his past, No. 18 will represent what can be achieved in the future — hope. “I firmly believe that God uses someone’s fame and great victories to help others, but only after those same victorious people fall victim to terrible trials,” Vernarelli said. “Only then can they truly offer the hope that so many people have lost.” ©2024 New York Daily News.

    "text": "The drive towards sustainability is fundamentally about creating an ecologically proficient environment that supports a healthy planet and combats the adverse effects of carbon emissions. Businesses play a pivotal role in this endeavor by adopting practices that reduce their environmental footprint and promote a green economy. Over the next five to ten years, businesses are setting ambitious sustainability targets. These include achieving carbon neutrality, sourcing 100% of electricity from renewable energy, and ensuring a sustainable and transparent supply chain. They aim to promote a circular economy with recycling and waste reduction, engage employees in sustainability efforts, and support customers in achieving their goals. Maintaining high standards in sustainability reporting and investing in AI and IoT technologies to drive sustainability are also key priorities. For leaders looking to integrate sustainability into their business operations, it is essential to set clear, measurable goals and embed sustainability into core strategies and decisions. Involving stakeholders in sustainability initiatives, focusing on technology and innovation, and educating and empowering employees are critical steps. Additionally, implementing robust monitoring and reporting systems ensures accountability and progress tracking. Collaboration with industry peers and stakeholders can significantly enhance impact; leading by example through actions that promote sustainability reinforces commitment and drives meaningful change. Leveraging Technology for Sustainability – Technological advancements play a significant role in helping businesses achieve their sustainability goals. Integrated software solutions for carbon accounting, energy management, and sustainable supply chain practices enable data-driven decisions that optimize resource use and reduce environmental footprints. Additionally, promoting circular economy initiatives and collaborating with partners on innovative solutions are pivotal for sustainable business practices. Reducing Carbon Footprint – Businesses implement various initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint, such as achieving carbon neutrality in operations, sourcing renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency. Sustainable procurement practices and technology-driven environmental monitoring are also key strategies. Embedding Sustainability in Supply Chain Operations – Ensuring sustainability within the supply chain involves enforcing strict environmental and social standards, monitoring compliance, and promoting transparency. Working closely with suppliers and prioritizing sustainable sourcing further embeds sustainability into supply chain operations. Impact of Innovative Technologies – Innovative technologies like Sustainability Control Systems, product carbon footprint analytics, and integrated reporting tools significantly impact businesses. These technologies enable companies to comply with regulatory requirements, improve operational efficiencies, and enhance brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to sustainability. This, in turn, provides a competitive edge in the global market. Data Analytics and AI – Data analytics and AI are instrumental in driving sustainability. By integrating these technologies into business operations, companies can optimize resource efficiency, reduce waste, and lower carbon footprint. Advanced predictive analytics and machine learning capabilities support sustainable decision-making, contributing to a more sustainable future. Cloud Infrastructure – Cloud infrastructure enhances sustainability by enabling efficient resource utilization, reducing energy consumption, and promoting scalable, environmentally friendly computing. It supports remote work, reduces business travel and associated emissions, and ensures continuous improvement in sustainability performance. By leveraging cloud services clients can consolidate data centers, optimize server utilization through virtualization, and adopt energy-efficient technologies that lower overall carbon footprints. Cloud-based solutions also support remote work and collaboration, reducing the need for extensive business travel and associated emissions. Successful Partnerships and Collaborations – Collaborations with global organizations, NGOs, and academia significantly advance sustainability efforts. Partnerships focusing on leveraging technology for environmental challenges and promoting circular economy principles drive tangible impact and foster global cooperation toward sustainability. The World Economic Forum’s Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth initiative focuses on leveraging technology like IoT and blockchain to tackle environmental challenges.

Measuring Sustainability Impact- Businesses measure the impact of their sustainability efforts using metrics like greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water usage, waste management, and sustainable procurement practices. Transparent reporting through annual sustainability reports and participation in sustainability indices like the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) or CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) ensure transparency by disclosing methodologies used for measurement, targets set, progress made against those targets, and future sustainability goals, thereby demonstrating accountability and commitment to sustainable business practices. Employee Engagement Engaging employees in sustainability initiatives is crucial for driving meaningful impact. Providing training, fostering a corporate culture of sustainability, and incentivizing participation empower employees to contribute actively to sustainability goals. The Unique Dynamics of Pakistan The country’s strategic geographic location offers access to a vast market in South Asia and the Middle East, fostering opportunities for trade and commerce. Pakistan has a youthful and increasingly tech-savvy population, which drives innovation and entrepreneurship. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on renewable energy, particularly solar and wind, given the country’s abundant natural resources. Government initiatives and policies are gradually aligning towards supporting sustainable business practices and improving the ease of doing business. The agricultural sector, a significant part of Pakistan’s economy, is also seeing advancements in sustainable farming techniques, enhancing productivity while minimizing environmental impact. Pakistan has the world’s most extensive irrigation system, supporting nearly 80% of the country’s agriculture. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, through its “Livelihood Restoration, Protection, and Sustainable Empowerment of Vulnerable Peasant Communities in Sindh Province” program, has aided smallholders in Sindh in adopting System of Rice Intensification (SRI) practices and technologies. SRI helps vulnerable farmers address increasing water shortages at the tail end of canals by applying various technologies related to water-efficient agricultural practices, on-farm water management, integrated pest and disease management, and integrated plant-soil nutrient management. This project has benefited over 80,000 peasant and smallholder farmers in 120 targeted villages in Sindh province. Ali Anwar, a 50-year-old small farmer from Loolja village in Dadu District, Sindh, adopted the Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) method to sow rice directly in his fields. This method allowed him to reduce water usage by 30%, lower labor requirements, and costs, and earn additional income by selling extra seedlings to neighboring farmers. Moreover, there is an increasing awareness and commitment among Pakistani businesses towards corporate social responsibility and sustainable development goals, creating a conducive environment for sustainable business practices. In Pakistan, businesses can enhance productivity and achieve a greener footprint by investing in renewable energy, adopting energy-efficient technologies, enhancing resource efficiency, integrating sustainability into corporate strategy, and fostering industry collaboration. Prioritizing sustainability can mitigate climate vulnerabilities and contribute positively to global environmental goals. Integrating sustainability with broader business objectives can enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and build a strong brand reputation. An integrated strategy that embeds sustainability into the core business operations can drive long-term value and ensure sustainable growth. By adopting sustainable practices, businesses can contribute to a healthier planet while achieving their strategic goals.

    "text": "Abortion opponents say they care for women and fetuses in equal measure. That claim was hard enough to defend with Roe still on the books, but with Roe gone, it’s impossible to make at all. Bans on abortion are forcing women to stay pregnant, often with devastating results. In Texas, an abortion ban likely contributed to the untimely death of Yeniifer Alvarez-Estrada Glick. Kate Cox fled Texas to get an abortion after her pregnancy turned dangerous. Amanda Zurawski , the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the state’s restrictions, nearly died from sepsis after she was denied an abortion for a doomed pregnancy. Although the Texas law has a medical exemption, critics like Zurawski say that it is too narrow, as doctors fear legal consequences for performing abortions. The same criticism may apply to exceptions for rape and incest, according to a new research letter in JAMA Internal Medicine . Researchers estimate that over 64,000 women and girls in 14 states became pregnant as the result of rape after Roe.\nTo reach that figure, researchers “first estimated the number of rapes that occurred in the states with abortion bans, while those bans were in effect — time periods that vary state-to-state,” NPR explained . They used data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and FBI Uniform Crime Reports “to assess the number of vaginal rapes of women, ages 15–45, that happened in those 14 states while abortion bans were in effect,” some 520,000 assaults, NPR added. Then, drawing on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they estimated that around 12.5 percent of those rapes would result in pregnancy. Most of those pregnancies occurred in states that do not allow exceptions for rape or incest, with 45 percent taking place in Texas. The letter says that “the large number of estimated rape-related pregnancies in abortion ban states compared with the 10 or fewer legal abortions per month occurring in each of those states” may be evidence that “persons who have been raped and become pregnant cannot access legal abortions in their home state, even in states with rape exceptions.”\nThe numbers map out a crisis, even though they are an estimate. Not everyone who gets pregnant from rape will choose abortion, but realistically, many would if they had a free choice. Instead, abortion bans have ripped freedom away from millions. People who get pregnant are living and breathing; they are real, not potential persons. They deserve justice, which they will likely not receive in states with abortion bans. In the case of pregnancy from rape, an abortion ban becomes a tool of abuse and a crime of power to match the initial assault. Justice stays a dream.\nResearchers say their figure is a projection and there are some limitations to their work. “These are hard numbers to come up with — there’s no kind of systematic collection at the level of health-care providers to be able to answer this question of what’s the pregnancy rate among people who have been victims of a completed vaginal rape,” researcher Samuel Dickman told NPR. “This is kind of the best we could do.” That may be enough for abortion opponents to dismiss their research. To do otherwise would be to reckon with serious moral and ethical questions about the consequences of their efforts — and there is no evidence they are willing to do that. The rights of women run secondary, always, to the biological needs of the fetus.\nThat’s great news for rapists, and for domestic abusers, too. As the 19th reported in 2023, OB/GYNs are often the first medical professionals to learn that someone is experiencing domestic violence, and abortion bans can force these doctors to leave certain states. When that happens, vulnerable people may be less likely to be screened and get help. “We’re creating conditions in this state where it’s going to be more and more difficult for someone to come forward for help,” Kelly Miller of the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence told the news outlet. An Idaho physician later explained, “We very much value privacy and the sanctity of the visit and the exam room. Most people feel safe once they’re here and the door is closed to be able to share information with us … It’s just by nature of what we do and how we’re trained. That’s our culture.” Abortion bans can cost women that lifeline.\nFor people experiencing domestic abuse, abortion can also be a way out. “It was just like a breath of fresh air after being strangled for so long,” one domestic-abuse survivor told the Texas Tribune in 2022. “It felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel. There was hope.” Domestic abusers often curtail a woman’s reproductive choices, the Tribune pointed out, and once she becomes pregnant, she can be at risk for additional violence and even murder. “Women who are pregnant or recently gave birth are twice as likely to die by homicide than any other cause of maternal mortality, most often at the hands of an intimate partner,” the Tribune added. A fixation on the fetus obscures the woman who carries it. Her life isn’t worthy of the same respect, and her body and mind must suffer.\nThat’s a rapist’s logic. Conservative lawmakers may not embrace it consciously, but they inflict violence on women all the same. As the anti-abortion movement shifts away from exceptions for rape and incest, their cruelty is ever harder to deny. So, too, is their lust for raw power: over anyone who can be or is pregnant, and over the rest of the country, too. Roe was insufficient, on its own, but it was a vital stopgap. Without it, there is suffering on a terrible scale. “I’m not surprised” by the number, one rape survivor told NPR. “If anything, I’m over here going — it’s probably higher.”",
