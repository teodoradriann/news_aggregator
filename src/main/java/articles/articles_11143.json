    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Maybank Investment Bank Research (Maybank IB Research) is positive about Aurelius Technologies Bhd ’s (ATech) growth and has placed a “buy” call on the group.\nThe research house did however trim its target price to RM3.05 from RM3.13, as the group shifted its fiscal year-end to December from January.\nIn a note, Maybank IB Research said things are looking up for the multi-component semiconductor provider as it gains a competitive edge in two high-growth sectors – the Internet of Things (IoT) and electric vehicles.\nATech has said it plans to diversify and enhance its IoT infrastructure together with its automotive-manufacturing segment, which will undertake more selective investments as the group aims to take on more projects and gain new customers.\nThe research house said ATech will stand to benefit from all this, as well as supply-chain diversification and foreign direct investments in the electrical and electronics sector.\n“We remain optimistic about ATech’s growth and have forecast a 16% compounded annual growth rate in core earnings for the next three years. Signs of recovery from customer-destocking headwinds are evident and earnings growth will be supported by new-model wins and the acquisition of new customers, backed by the group’s expansion initiatives,” Maybank IB Research said.\nMeanwhile, the research house said ATech’s nine-month revenue this year declined 12% to RM302.5mil, on the back of aggressive inventory downsizing by customers that led to a lower production volume.“Despite this, gross profit margin improved slightly thanks to a better product mix. Core net profit rose 2% year-on-year to RM25.8mil, driven by effective cost control and lower finance costs,” the research house said.\nRevenue growth of 14% for electric devices cushioned the declines in communications, IoT and semiconductor components (C&I/SC).\n“Looking at quarter-on-quarter performance, electric devices outperformed with a 29% sales increase, while C&I/SC experienced contractions of 13% and 40% respectively.\n“The strength in the electric-devices segment is mainly attributed to increased demand from an oil and gas (O&G) customer, fuelled by recent activity in O&G sector,” the research house noted.\nFurthermore, Maybank IB Research said that ATech’s order book as of Dec 11, had significantly increased to RM473mil from RM322mil on Sept 19, indicating the end of inventory destocking by customers.\nThe research house noted some of the risks it foresees included weaker demands from customers, a lower than expected costs pass through and operational disruptions from labour issues or component shortages.\nOpen Modal ×",

Il a tenu promesse. Dès l’entame. Sur une pénalité récupérée, Billy Searle trouve une touche dans les 22 mètres. Après un bon maul des avants, le ballon est écarté.\nA lire aussi :\nSU Agen : en 1985, une fin d’aventure particulière pour Joël Llop\nLancé dans l’intervalle, Loris Tolot résiste au retour de la défense pour aplatir un premier essai cousu main (5-0, 3e). Mais la réaction biarrote est immédiate, et intervient dans un tout autre style. En force. Après plusieurs temps de jeu au ras, Piula Fa’asalele transperce la défense agenaise (5-7, 8e).\nA lire aussi :\nPro D2 : feu d’artifice, bandas, food-trucks… Le SU Agen prépare une belle soirée à Armandie pour le match contre Biarritz\nLe SUA réduit à quatorze\nTout est à refaire dans une rencontre rythmée et agréable. Chaque formation se répond du tac au tac. De retour dans le camp adverse, le SUA est précis. Dorian Bellot profite de l’avancée pour se faufiler en bord de regroupement et remettre les siens devant.\nA lire aussi :\nPro D2 : John Madigan fait son retour avec le SU Agen pour défier Biarritz\nTout du moins, c’est ce qu’on croyait. L’essai est refusé à la vidéo pour une faute d’Iban Etcheverry (15e). Le combat continue. Et ce sont au tour des Biarrots de contrer. Mathieu Acebes décale Yohan Tapie sur son aile.\nA lire aussi :\nPro D2 : \"C’est tout pour moi…\" Libre depuis son départ du SU Agen, le Gallois Joe Maksymiw annonce la fin de sa carrière\nEn débordement, l’ailier pousse le ballon au pied et profite du rebond favorable pour réaliser un premier break (5-14, 21e). Le scénario catastrophe se dessine.\nA lire aussi :\nPro D2 : \"Je voudrais travailler ici après ma carrière…\" Evan Olmstead est tombé amoureux de la France et du SU Agen\nD’autant plus après le carton rouge infligé à Hans Lombard-Buret, coupable d’avoir déblayé Yohan Beheregaray de manière virulente (23e). Sur l’action suivante, le BO, par l’intermédiaire de Retière, sur un petit côté bien négocié, trouve à nouveau la faille (5-19, 26e).\nA lire aussi :\nPro D2 : \"On a le couteau entre les dents\" Un SU Agen revanchard pour la réception du Biarritz Olympique\nÀ ce moment-là, on ne voit pas comment le Sporting peut revenir. Mais pourtant, il va le faire.

Un choix gagnant. Le maul avance et envoie Valentin Gayraud dans l’en-but. Agen recolle (19-19, 33e).\nA lire aussi :\nPro D2 : \"Je me sens de plus en plus impliqué dans ce rôle…\" Peyo Muscarditz est en train de devenir un leader du SU Agen\nLa fin de première période est électique, avec un arbitre ne maîtrisant pas la rencontre.

Bellot joue bien le petit côté, et décale Tolot pour mettre les Agenais en tête aux vestiaires (26-19, 40e).\nA lire aussi :\nPro D2 : le demi de mêlée du SU Agen Dorian Bellot prolonge son contrat pour trois saisons\nUn SUA déchaîné\nAgen débute la seconde période comme la première. Rapidement, le Sporting se retrouve à cinq mètres de l’en-but, mais perd inexplicablement le ballon. Sur le contre, Biarritz n’est pas loin d’égaliser (45e).\nUne grosse frayeur ne rafraîchissant par un SUA métamorphosé. Logiquement, Searle concrétise la domination des siens à deux reprises (32-19, 57e).\nEt le score pourrait même être plus impressionnant, tant les Agenais se montrent irrésistibles, claquant un formidable 27-0 en étant en infériorité numérique. Et même un 34-0 !\nCar, après un lancement bien travaillé, Kolinio Ramoka explose tout sur son passage pour embraser un Armandie soudainement réchauffé (39-19, 62e).\nLa rencontre, tellement rythmée, se déroule sans mêlée pendant une demi-heure, et Florent Guion entre seulement à l’heure de jeu.

    "text": "[Castingshadows](/community/members/castingshadows.26290853/)\nWell-known member\n- Apr 14, 2020\n- 3,061\n- 2,665\nI have a large collection of high quality sandalwood oils and I’ve had this itch for years to start making my own blends according to my own personal taste. With this experiment I wanted to take my sinking grade Indonesian Sandalwood roots distillation that already showcased warm, boozy amber notes with rich, spicy, woodsy qualities and expand on the vertical and horizontal scent spectrum. In other words I wanted to enrich the top notes and extend the basenotes. I didn’t want to change the inherent nature of the sandalwood but rather create an interesting base I can use in other blends.\nOkay so heres the materials I used:\nFraterworks Epice FW\nFraterworks Absolute Ambergris\nFraterworks Labdanum Absolute (dark)\nFraterworks Olibanum Couer MD\nFraterworks Ambre Royale\nHeres my approach (all materials undiluted except labdanum which is 50%):\n2 grams of sandalwood\n1 tiny drop absolute ambergris\n5 tiny drops labdanum\n3 tiny drops Olibanum\n5 drops Ambre Royale\nTiny plastic toothpick dipped in Epice\nObviously this is completely rudimentary and not scientific nor professional in any capacity and I know I broke tons of perfumery rules by not weighing anything, prediluting materials, or using tiny amounts for experimenting. I got excited and didn’t want to wait for my equipment to get here so I used some pipettes I had laying around and eyeballed everything.\nWhat surprised me the most was Epice FW. This material has such a gorgeous, soapy, vintage quality that brings out old stock Mysore vibes in the Sandalwood. It ever so gently creates a spicy floral note I didn’t expect to happen. I barely used any here yet it helped to create beautiful lift in the opening along with the gentle citric qualities present. The booze also takes on a slight egg nog aroma in that it’s boozy but spiced. The florals are gorgeous here and I’m actually surprised at how much they feel like they were always a part of the oil.\nThe other materials aren’t as present but they are felt in texture and performance. The amber notes literally round out the base of the oil and makes the material feel huge as if it’s a perfume in its own right while still smelling like Sandalwood. The sweetness only helps to expand on the amber notes already present. I need to use more labdanum and olibanum though as I can safely say now these materials will synergistically enhance the aroma.\nThe performance more than anything caught me off guard. This has solid projection which is way stronger than I thought it would be so that’s a huge plus especially for fixative properties.\nI have some dreamwood I want to add in order to bring out some dry, woody qualities to balance the boozy warmth. I’m not sure where to start with that because I’m pretty sure it’ll need precision and dilution as I really don’t want to overdose so I’ll wait for my scale and glass to get here before I do.\nMost of all I just had fun. It feels great to wear this on my skin and the wheels are already turning on how to use this base material for a spicy pineapple mulkullat I’ve always wanted to make.\nOkay so heres the materials I used:\nFraterworks Epice FW\nFraterworks Absolute Ambergris\nFraterworks Labdanum Absolute (dark)\nFraterworks Olibanum Couer MD\nFraterworks Ambre Royale\nHeres my approach (all materials undiluted except labdanum which is 50%):\n2 grams of sandalwood\n1 tiny drop absolute ambergris\n5 tiny drops labdanum\n3 tiny drops Olibanum\n5 drops Ambre Royale\nTiny plastic toothpick dipped in Epice\nObviously this is completely rudimentary and not scientific nor professional in any capacity and I know I broke tons of perfumery rules by not weighing anything, prediluting materials, or using tiny amounts for experimenting.

    "title": "Inundaciones en España: “Las cuatro horas de diluvio aún suenan en nuestra cabeza”",
    "text": "“Los servicios van y vienen, el agua está cortada. La luz, también, e internet se corta todo el tiempo. Los supermercados de la zona vacíos o inundados y no llegan los abastecimientos porque las carreteras y puentes cortados, la gente camina kilómetros para conseguir comida en las zonas no afectadas”. Este es el panorama desolador que pinta a LA GACETA Marcia Mordini, una tucumana que vive desde hace más de 20 años en [España](https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/1057975/mundo/argentina-ofrecio-asistencia-humanitaria-espana-tragicas-inundaciones.html), en la zona montañosa de Valencia, cercana a donde ocurrieron las peores [inundaciones](https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/1057932/lgplay/tucumana-conto-como-vivio-impacto-inundaciones-valencia.html) en un siglo. Su casa, en Torrente, quedó fuera del área arrasada por el aluvión de agua y lodo. “Nosotros estamos lejos del pueblo, más en la montaña y hemos tenido suerte, sólo con pérdidas materiales -describe-. Pero el ruido constante de cuatro horas de diluvio, con granizo y viento, aún suena en nuestras cabezas”. La situación que pinta es “terrorífica”. Torrent está a no más de 10 kilómetros de Paiporta, una de las ciudades que sufrió el mayor impacto del fenómeno llamado DANA (acrónimo de Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos) y conocido popularmente como “la gota fría”. En Torrent y pueblos cercanos “hay vecinos que no pueden salir de casa porque los coches amontonados no los dejan”, cuenta Marcia. Hasta ayer, el pueblo estaba incomunicado con la capital de Valencia, Aldaia y alrededores. A las personas que quedaron atrapadas en edificios, en las ciudades y pueblos más golpeados, “les dan comida y agua por el balcón -relata-. Los que quisieron salvar los autos de las cocheras en subsuelo han muerto ahogados. Se ven (coches) en las calles, amontonados, muchos con sus dueños adentro, muertos”. En la entrada de Paiporta, la entrada del pueblo, la furiosa ola marrón dejó amontonados los coches en una plaza cercana al cuartel de la Guardia Civil. No importa el feriado Mientras termina de llegar la ayuda oficial, una multitud de voluntarios se dirigió a los alrededores de Valencia para auxiliar a los vecinos atrapados en el infierno de barro que trajo la riada. Es el Día de Todos los Santos, viernes y feriado en España y ya antes del mediodía, una multitud cruzaba apresurada los puentes que unen la ciudad de Valencia con la periferia sur, llevando palas, escobas o agua. “Hemos tomado lo que teníamos en casa, y a ayudar”, cuenta Federico Martínez, con una pala al hombro. Llegado de una localidad del otro lado de Valencia, camina junto a unos amigos hacia la zona afectada. Tras conocer la magnitud de esta tragedia sin precedentes, que ya suma más de 200 fallecidos, miles de personas se lanzaron caminando hacia las zonas arrasadas, todavía cortadas al tráfico. “Esto emociona, pone los pelos de punta”, explica este ingeniero de 55 años con la voz entrecortada. A medida que se avanza por las huertas ahora devastadas que unen la capital valenciana, donde no llegó la riada, se multiplica el barro y las huellas del desastre que ha dejado a miles y miles de personas sin agua y sin luz desde la fatídica tarde del martes. “Toda ayuda es poca. Menos mal que España es solidaria”, opina Alicia Izquierdo. Junto a su hermana Marta caminan empujando dos carros de compra con alimentos hacia la casa de su hermano, que vive en Paiporta, una localidad de más de 25.000 habitantes convertida en el epicentro de la destrucción. Tampoco lo pensó mucho Tamara Gil cuando se lanzó a caminar los tres kilómetros de huerta y polígonos industriales que separan Valencia de Paiporta. A paso ligero, va empujando un carro metálico con agua y todo lo que creyó que podía ser útil. Quiere llegar cuanto antes al colegio donde es profesora y del que se fue el martes por la tarde, poco antes de que la riada arrasara Paiporta. Tras aquella noche que pasó al teléfono esperando noticias, aún desconoce si todos sus alumnos están bien. A pura voluntad Las autoridades intentaron disuadir a los voluntarios argumentando que podrían obstaculizar las vías de paso de los equipos de rescate, aunque van a pie. Muchos cargan sus garrafas y bolsas por las calles cubiertas de barro que llevan al auditorio municipal. Allí, junto a los coches amontonados frente a la fachada principal, han apartado ramas y escombros para establecer un punto de distribución de ayuda. Después de casi tres días sin agua ni luz, y con los comercios del municipio arrasados, decenas de vecinos aguardan en una larga fila. “Lo primordial es la comida y el agua”, explica junto a su esposa Ramón Vicente, de 73 años, ambos damnificados. Ellos vivieron la riada de 1957, que anegó la ciudad de Valencia, dejó decenas de muertos y marcó a generaciones de valencianos. El desastre actual ha pulverizado todos los registros.“Me acuerdo de aquello y la ciudad pasó mucho tiempo para recuperarse”, lamenta junto a su esposa Fausti, preocupada por cómo podrá conseguir los medicamentos que necesita, en un hospital al que ahora no puede llegar. “A la gente mayor esto nos va a pasar factura”, suspira. Falta organización En cada calle, vecinos y voluntarios tratan de achicar montañas de barro todavía húmedo y viscoso de las casas. Todo es marrón ahora en Paiporta, donde ninguna planta baja se ha salvado de la crecida. De la iglesia principal del municipio, los voluntarios siguen sacando baldes de barro, de un interior donde el agua llega a los tobillos. Frente al barranco, un grupo de voluntarios trata de apartar el barro que llena una de las vías. “Falta organización. La gente quiere ayudar, pero no hay nadie que organice”, observa Montse Fernández, que ha venido desde Godella, al norte de Valencia. “No hay suficientes bomberos, no llegan las palas… Aquí todo es particular”, explica Paco Clemente, un farmacéutico de 33 años que ha venido de la cercana Torrente, mientras saca montones de fango del interior de la casa de unos amigos. Al otro lado del barranco, Estefanía García camina con precaución entre el barro con su bebé de un mes y medio dormida en los brazos. Su familia le está esperando junto a su hija de dos años para irse de Paiporta a un lugar más seguro. Han sido días terribles, pero pese a todo se siente afortunada. “Hemos perdido los coches, parte de la casa, pero estamos vivos”, explica con los ojos vidriosos.",
