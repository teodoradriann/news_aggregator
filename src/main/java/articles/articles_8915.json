    "text": "I Accidentally Caused Two Couples To Divorce\nI can’t complain about being lonely for one weekend.\nMy husband was gone for only about 26 hours, and I had the audacity to find myself feeling lonely.\nEvery summer, Jack spends three or four nights away from home on camping trips with friends or our kids. This past weekend, Jack took our 14-year-old Catherine and our 9-year-old Eloise out with two of his guy friends and their daughters, leaving me home with 16-year-old Holden and 11-year-old Sylvia from 10 a.m. Saturday morning until about noon the next day.\nHolden, being a teenage gamer, tends to sequester himself in his bedroom for much of his summer days. Sylvia was clearly enjoying the lack of sisterly conflict, happily crafting and reading in her own bedroom. I should have been overjoyed with uninterrupted writing time, but with the extroverts of our family out for the day, the energy in our home felt off.\nI was surprisingly distracted by the unsettling silence and, most especially, by the knowledge that the night ahead wouldn’t bring the companionship of another adult.\nJack and I have been glued at the hip since we fell in love at age seventeen. We’ve structured our lives to maximize our time together. Even when we worked opposite shifts in an effort to circumvent childcare costs, Jack worked from home, his deep phone voice reminding me of his presence behind his home office’s French doors.\nNow, Jack works outside the home, keeping a standard 8–5 hours and rushing home after work. He enters the house boisterous, eager to share quips with our kids. He also likes to keep to an evening routine together, which includes walking our dogs together around 6 p.m. before family snack time and a show at 7:30 p.m. We send the kids to their bedrooms before 8 p.m., and then Jack and I soak in our hot tub or have sex, sometimes both.\nMonkey Business Images / Shutterstock\nEvery evening with Jack is a date, a commitment to optimize all available minutes of our life together.\nWhen Jack is gone for a night, I wish I could sigh with relief at my independence or bask in my solitude. After all, sometimes I get annoyed with Jack’s penchant for routines and scheduling all of our time. But without his pending presence just after 5 p.m., I feel free to the point that I almost flounder.\nIt’s too easy to grow listless, bored, and unmotivated. Who’s going to stop me if I opt to binge Netflix instead of writing in my journal? Why bother with my hair? Why does all this unstructured time debilitate me instead of liberating me?\nWith unease, I realized this is how my friend and my sister felt after their divorces. Divorces that I had inadvertently caused.\nMy friend Tarah had visited us just the day before Jack’s camping trip. She was in good spirits, but she was wistful as she surveyed my family home, kitchen clutter, and endless chatter abounding. “Your house is so full of life,” she sighed. “It’s been hard getting used to being alone.”\nTarah and Ned divorced the year prior, right around the same time that my sister got a divorce as well. In fact, Tarah and Molly divorced their husbands for almost the exact same reason — they realized that they were married to jerks — and they came to their grim realizations about their husbands because of me.\nJack and I were still relatively new to non-monogamy when we formed a relationship with Tarah and Ned. At first, it worked out quite naturally to be a swap situation since Ned and I worked together. He and I developed a friendship and fooled around, but nothing was ever casual or simple. I practically had a nervous breakdown after several interactions with Ned. I never knew where I stood with him, and I felt like there must have been something seriously wrong with me.\nTarah, meanwhile, was watching our relationship unfold with wide eyes. My sudden anxiety was uncannily similar to her own, except that she had been struggling for years, blaming herself. But with our parallel stories starting to overlap, it became clear that Ned was the common denominator.\nIt also became clear that Ned was\n a textbook narcissist. Tarah and I started diving into the topic, which was easy to do with the abundance of materials on narcissism now available online.\nThe universal advice for dealing with a toxic person like Ned was simple enough for me —\n go no-contact. It wasn’t as simple for Tarah, but she was eager to climb out of the nightmare she’d been living in for years. Ned and Tarah divorced within the year.\nMeanwhile, my sister was privy to the Ned stories as they unfolded. She listened to me drone on about narcissism as she struggled in her own marriage. Molly’s husband bore an uncanny resemblance to Ned in terms of his toxic behaviors,\n from gaslighting to hoovering to manipulation.\nWe already knew that Antoine had been unfaithful to Molly, perhaps for years, which,\n according to a 2020 study, is common among narcissists. But now Molly realizes with sickening horror that Antoine will never change. She would never have the love or life she longed for — not with him.\nWhen Molly called me sobbing one night, asking for my unfiltered opinion on Antoine and their marriage, I didn’t hold back.\nI encouraged her to leave him, to move on, to find herself, to find someone better, and to find someone deserving of her love and devotion. I encouraged yet another divorce.\nAnd now Tarah and Molly are alone.\nWell, they’re not totally alone. Both of them have two children, but children aren’t the same as adult companions, are they?\nIn the past, I’d schedule visits with friends while Jack was gone. This time, I didn’t bother. I figured that I should spend some quality time with the kids at home instead. Holden declined the invite, but Sylvia was excited about going out to dinner at a nicer restaurant than we normally take our entire family of six.\nI love spending time with Sylvia. She’s tiny for a kid going into sixth grade, less than the first percentile on the growth charts — but she eloquently speaks her mind with the boldness of an old lady. She’s extremely inquisitive, which can sometimes be exhausting, but it also makes for interesting conversation.\nThat said, conversing for an extended time while waiting for our food at the restaurant reminded me that I am awful at leading a conversation, especially with a fellow neurodivergent introvert. Jack is stellar in social situations; clearly, I rely on his skills even with our own children.\nOur dinner also reminded me of our age gap and the importance of peer companionship. While I thoroughly enjoyed strolling up Main Street and through the neighborhood with Sylvia after dinner, taking the long way back to our minivan, I found myself again missing the camaraderie of another adult.\nI thought of the times that I had encouraged Tarah and Molly as they wrestled with making their decisions. “I wanted a family,” Tarah and Molly had both said at different points in the divorce process. I had tried to comfort both of them by saying what I now see as trite — “Well, you still have your children…”\nChildren are quite special on their own, of course, but I admit that there’s something even more special about sharing a child with a beloved spouse. Even just going out to dinner that night, there were so many little moments with Sylvia that I wished I could have shared with Jack, too. I tried to bottle them all up to share later, but it wasn’t the same as catching his eye across the table whenever she said something particularly charming or witty.\nAnd the thing is, Tarah and Molly don’t even have their kids full-time. They both share custody of their kids with their ex-husbands. Plus, Tarah’s kids are older and more independent, like mine, and thus, they tend to do their own things even when they’re with her. Molly’s kids, meanwhile, are young and thus needy. It’s not ideal either way.\nSylvia’s body, like mine, craved Jack’s routine even when he was gone. When our show ended, and it was time to clean up the popcorn just before 8:30 p.m., Sylvia didn’t hesitate to head up to her bedroom for reading and rest.\nFor a moment, I scrolled through Netflix, considering if I should start watching something just for me. After all, I could do whatever I wanted. Jack wouldn’t be pushing me to go to bed before 10 p.m., nor would he be there to rouse me by 6 a.m. the next morning. But nothing looked interesting, and my own body beckoned to keep the routine.\nMy sister and Tarah both complained about the lack of sex as soon as their divorces were imminent.\nThey had needs, and of course, I understood that. Jack and I have sex about every other night. I write about the importance of sex and pleasure often, even taking “\nsex trips” to get further in touch with my sexuality and, thus, my soul.\nI also had the nerve to suggest that masturbation could somehow suffice for Tarah and Molly in the absence of a partner. What did I know about partnerless sex? Sure, I’d settled down with a story and a vibrator on several occasions when Jack was out of town, eager to experience the ease of getting one off without “all the hassle” of regular sex. But it was certainly no substitute.\nIn fact, I recalled it as being ultimately anti-climatic despite the orgasms that come easily to me. I didn’t even consider masturbating when Jack was gone just this past weekend. Instead, I wrote a journal entry and leisurely moved through my nighttime skincare regimen. I was asleep before 10 p.m.\nTarah and Molly both intended to spend some time alone after their divorces, but they found themselves dating again sooner rather than later.\nAt first, I worried aloud to Jack that they were moving too quickly. I thought that perhaps they should spend some time healing and introspecting, working on self-love, and regrouping with hopes for a better partnership in the future.\nBut it isn’t up to me\n who they date or when. Plus, I can’t really talk, can I? I can barely spend one night alone without feeling lonely.\nThat said, I hope they don’t settle. I hope they find a man like Jack, who cries during foursomes because he finds them so beautiful. Jack may embarrass me with his negotiation skills, especially at car dealerships, but he also brings all the fun into my life.\nThere’s a reason I’m\n constantly comparing Jack to a Golden Retriever. He greets me whenever we’ve been separate for more than a half hour, saying, “You’re here! I am so glad to see you! Oooh, I just want to kiss you! Are we going to have sex tonight? Let me tell you all about my day! And when are we going to take a walk? Can we go soon? Can we? I’ll follow you upstairs; I want to watch you change.”\nYes, as Tarah once pointed out to me, he follows me around like a puppy dog. Whenever it gets annoying, I simply remind myself of my privilege of having Jack as a partner. I’m a spoiled princess, and yes, I know it.\nI may crave alone time to write or read, but I love that Jack inspires and encourages me to be my best self. I love when we call each other out for spending too much time on our phones. I love our shared love of nutrition and fitness, and I adore the way our entire family interacts together.\nLife is simply better with Jack around. And I suppose that’s what people should look for in a partner, right? Someone who makes your life better. Someone you want to spend time with. Someone you completely vibe with, someone you understand and who understands you in return.\nTarah and Molly saw what I had, and they realized that no matter how hard they tried, they weren’t going to get that with the men they were with.\nWhen they asked me for my honest opinion, I gave it. I encouraged them to proceed with their divorces and pursue better partners. And now they spend many of their evenings alone, enduring the quiet, boring calm of a one-adult household.\nMy loneliness without Jack that Saturday night altered into a mashup of appreciation for my partner and guilt over my involvement in Tarah and Molly’s current situations. I put things in perspective; I got over myself.\nI know it isn’t my fault that they married toxic men, nor is it all on me that they compared their miserable marriages with my exceptional ones. Sure, comparison may be the thief of joy, but does it also give others something to aspire to? Tarah and Molly each realized they deserved to be properly loved by their life partners, and their decisions were ultimately just that — theirs.\nBut that doesn’t mean that I can’t continue to offer them my empathy and support. I know from too much relationship experience over the past years, having dabbled in polyamory and eventually eschewing it for monogam(ish)y, that love takes many forms. As mere humans, we all need social connections and understanding.\nI also know that I can’t take Jack for granted. I am lucky to spend my days longing for my hot husband to arrive back home, inevitably greeting me with a compliment and a kiss. I am grateful that I have someone worthy of missing when they’re gone, even if they’re gone for just one night.\nAnna Eliza Rose is a writer, librarian, and mom of four.

    "text": "A Prayer for When You Doubt God's Work in Your Life - Your Daily Prayer - June 2 A Prayer for When You Doubt God's Work in Your Life By Christine Perry \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.” [John 5:17b NIV] Have you ever looked at your life, and it seems like nothing was happening? You read your Bible, pray, go to church, and you aren't seeing the outcomes you want to see. Maybe you've come to a place in your faith where you doubt that God is even at work. If that's you, I want to share a true story with you. Lee Stobel, a former atheist and journalist for the Chicago Tribune, came to Christ after trying to disprove Christianity. After his conversion, he wrote the book The Case for Christ . One day, Lee felt compelled to share the gospel with his former coworker. He was excited to let his former coworker know how Jesus had changed his life. He went in full assurance that something radical was going to take place. As Lee shared his newfound faith and invited this man to church, his former coworker sat stonewalled. At the end of the conversation, he not only didn't budge on his atheism, he blatantly refused to go to church. Lee walked out of his former coworker's office completely baffled. He genuinely believed he was supposed to go and share the gospel and he didn't see what he hoped he would see, and yet, he truly believed he was doing what the Lord asked. Was this God's work or was he being led by his own ideas? Have you been there? Maybe you stepped out in faith and fell flat on your face. Perhaps you did what the Lord asked you to do, and the results didn't pan out the way you thought they would. You may be wondering if you heard wrong. You've been praying, and yet you have heard no answer. I want to remind you, as I remind myself, that God is always at work in you and in the world — even if we can't see it. The story about Lee isn't over. Several months after Lee had enthusiastically shared his faith with his former coworker, a man came up to him and said, \"You don't know me, but you lead me to Christ.\" Lee stood there bewildered by the man's words. The man continued, \"I was out of work, and I knew someone at the Chicago Tribune. Since I am a handyman by trade, they hired me to lay tile. You came into the office where I was working and shared about Jesus and how He changed your life. The guy you were speaking with didn't care to hear it, but I was behind his desk working. I heard every word.\" Friends, you never know what the Lord is up to. He is always at work, even when You can't see it. Don't give up. Keep trusting in Him. He is good, and He does good. Let's pray: Dear Heavenly Father, Please forgive us for doubting You. We cannot see the whole picture but You can. Thank You that You are always at work. Thank You that You neither slumber nor sleep. Thank you that You guard our ways and lead us in paths of righteousness for Your name sake. Thank You that when we are weak, You are strong. Thank You that when we fall short, You have all we need. Thank You that You are able to work, even while we rest. Help us to be still and know You because You say to seek first Your kingdom and Your righteousness, and all these things, our daily needs, will be added unto us. Thank You that You see the beginning to the end. Thank You that You know what is the very best for us. Thank You that You have not forgotten us. But I pray that You would help us to trust in You and to get busy loving, serving, and caring for those around us. Help us to think of others better than ourselves so that we will not waste the time You've given us here on earth. Lord, we love You. Help us to be more like You. Help us to be slow to speak, quick to listen, and slow to become angry. We need Your help every day. Thank You for never giving up on us. We are grateful. Amen!

    "text": "Inaugural Caregiver Olympics held at Southern Hills Mall SIOUX CITY (KTIV) - Several local healthcare organizations came together to participate in their inaugural Caregiver Olympics. The organizations participated against each other in teams of three at the Southern Hills Mall. They had to make a bed, put a shirt on a mannequin and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Once teams were finished a judged panel looked at their results. This was to educate people on what they do. “We wanted to have a fun event to raise awareness the very important and sometimes difficult work that caregivers do so we invited agencies that have caregivers go in the homes of others,” said Kristen Hammerstrom of Visiting Angels. This also shows a few of the things caregivers do. “It also showcases how difficult it can be. Not only for family members that are doing it, but we want to raise awareness there are services in town that you can get help because no one can do it on their own because as I said it is very difficult to care for a loved one,” said Kim Wilson of Hospice of Siouxland. This event was held in conjunction with National Care at Home Month. Copyright 2024 KTIV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "In vielen Städten droht ab 1. Mai Chaos: Wo Sie ein digitales Passfoto erstellen können\nEine große Änderung bei Fotos für Reisepass oder Personalausweis ist ab Mai gültig. Doch vielerorts fehlt es in den Bürgerämtern an nötigen Geräten.\nMünchen – Auf alle Bundesbürger kommt ab 1. Mai eine wichtige Änderung zu, die Ausweise betrifft. Das digitale Passfoto wird zur Pflicht. Doch müssen wirklich alle Menschen in Deutschland ab Mai umdenken? Nicht ganz – denn für einige Bürgerämter kommt das Startdatum für die Änderung beim Passfoto offenbar zu früh. In zahlreichen Behörden fehlen die geeigneten Foto-Terminals, um die Neuerung umzusetzen. Somit könnte die Umstellung auf das digitale Passfoto vielerorts chaotisch ablaufen.\nDigitales Passfoto: Ab 1. Mai Pflicht – doch in vielen Städten gibt es nicht ausreichend Foto-Terminals\nWie personalausweisportal.de erklärt, gelten folgende Regeln ab Mai: „Papierbasierte Passbilder sind ab dem 1. Mai 2025 für die Beantragung hoheitlicher Identitätsdokumente nicht mehr zugelassen. Lichtbilder für Identitätsdokumente müssen ab diesem Zeitpunkt von Fotostudios ausschließlich in elektronischer Form über gesicherte elektronische Übermittlungswege zum Bürgeramt (Pass /Ausweisbehörde) übermittelt werden. Alternativ kann die Behörde anbieten, Lichtbilder vor Ort in der Behörde elektronisch aufzunehmen und medienbruchfrei in den Antragsprozess zu übernehmen.“\nAn dieser Stelle weist das zum Bundesministerium des Innern und für Heimat gehörende Portal allerdings darauf hin, dass nicht alle Behördenzweigstellen hierfür gerüstet sind: „Ob in dem für Sie zuständigen Bürgeramt Geräte zur Lichtbildaufnahme vorhanden sind, erfragen Sie bitte bei Ihrer Behörde, beispielsweise über deren Internetseite oder telefonisch.“ Das könnte für viele Bürger den Prozess schwieriger gestalten, als erhofft.\nUnterschiedliche Voraussetzungen in Bayern: München ist bereit, Nürnberg muss Frist verschieben\nAuch in Bayern sind nicht alle Städte für die neue Regelung gerüstet. Dies zeigt sich, wenn man auf die drei an Einwohnern größten Städte des Bundeslandes schaut – eine Stadt musste das Papierfoto-Verbot sogar verschieben:\nStadt: | Digital-Foto-Pflicht: | Foto-Terminals in Bürgerbüros: |\n---|---|---|\nMünchen | ja (ab 1. Mai 2025) | ja, an allen Standorten |\nNürnberg | nein (Übergangsregelung, bis 31. Mai 2025 noch Papierfotos erlaubt) | nur in einigen vorhanden |\nAugsburg | ja (ab 1. Mai 2025) | ja, an allen Standorten |\nAuch andere Bundesländer sind in den Großstädten nur lückenhaft aufgestellt. So ist in Baden-Württemberg Mannheim vorbereitet und kann in allen Behördenzweigstellen Foto-Terminals vorweisen. Dagegen hat die Landeshauptstadt Stuttgart diese nur in wenigen Behörden zu bieten. Auch in Karlsruhe verfügen laut offiziellem Stadt-Portal derzeit nur „einige Bürgerbüros“ über die Foto-Terminals.\nHessens Landeshauptstadt hat „keine geeigneten Fotoautomaten“ – Frankfurt bestens ausgestattet\nIn Hessen ist die Lage in der Landeshauptstadt Wiesbaden eindeutig, wie das Stadtportal schreibt: „Derzeit stehen vor Ort keine geeigneten Fotoautomaten zur Verfügung. Aufgrund technischer Vorgaben dürfen die bisher vorhandenen Selfservice-Terminals ab dem 1. Mai 2025 nicht mehr genutzt werden.“ Für die Bürger in Kassel sind nach Angaben der Stadt „Lieferverzögerungen der Fotoaufnahmegeräte durch die Bundesdruckerei“ der Grund, warum die Foto-Terminals dort keine digitalen Passbilder ausspucken. Dies gehe „voraussichtlich erst ab Juli 2025“, heißt es auf dem Stadtportal. Dadurch gilt: „Bis zum 31. Juli 2025 können daher ausnahmsweise papiergebundene Passbilder eingereicht werden.“ Die Übergangsfrist bis Ende Juli hat das Bundesinnenministerium den Behörden-Standorten aufgrund der Verzögerungen bei der Auslieferung von Foto-Terminals eingeräumt.\nDafür hat Frankfurt die Foto-Terminals bereitgestellt. „In allen unseren Frankfurter Bürgerämtern und Außenstellen stehen entsprechende Aufnahmegeräte der Bundesdruckerei ‚PointID‘ zur Verfügung“, sagte eine Sprecherin der Stadt Frankfurt auf IPPEN.MEDIA-Nachfrage.\n„PointID“-System der Bundesdruckerei\nWird für ein Ausweisdokument (Reisepass, Personalausweis, elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel) das Lichtbild in der Behörde angefertigt, kostet das ab dem 1. Mai 2025 bundeseinheitlich sechs Euro, wenn die Behörde „PointID“-Systeme der Bundesdruckerei einsetzt. Hat sich die Kommune für ein System eines anderen, privaten Anbieters entschieden, können andere Kosten anfallen.\nWurden bei einem „PointID“-System mehrere Biometrie-konforme Lichtbilder erzeugt, kann die antragstellende Person in der Regel eine Auswahl aus bis zu drei Lichtbildern treffen. Der Aufnahmeprozess kann darüber hinaus abgebrochen oder neu gestartet werden, sofern der antragstellenden Person keines der angezeigten Lichtbilder gefällt. (Quelle: personalausweisportal.de)\nNRW-Landeshauptstadt Düsseldorf klagt über Lieferverzögerungen – Hamm hat noch Nachholbedarf\nDie Erstellung eines digitalen Passfotos ist auch für Einwohner von Nordrhein-Westfalens Landeshauptstadt Düsseldorf in den dortigen Bürgerbüros vorerst nicht möglich. „Aufgrund von Lieferverzögerungen bei der Bundesdruckerei Berlin kann dieser Service leider nicht sofort zum 1. Mai 2025 angeboten werden“, heißt es auf dem offiziellen Portal der Stadt. Es sei mit einer Verzögerung „bis zum Sommer 2025“ zu rechnen. In Köln wurden die Self-Service-Terminals für digitale Fotos bereits bis Anfang 2022 in allen Bürgerzentren installiert, um auf die Gesetzesänderung ab Mai 2025 vorbereitet zu sein. In Hamm sind derzeit zwei Bürgerämter (Bockum-Hövel, Mitte) mit Foto-Terminals ausgerüstet, die das digitale Passbild erstellen können. Die restlichen Standorte sollen zeitnah folgen, erklärte ein Stadtsprecher auf Nachfrage von IPPEN.MEDIA.\nDie Bürgerämter in Berlin sind offenbar bereit für den Wechsel zum digitalen Passfoto – allerdings nicht alle. „An den meisten Bürgeramtsstandorten ist die Technik zum Stichtag verfügbar beziehungsweise einsatzbereit“, hieß es aus der zuständigen Berliner Senatskanzlei gegenüber tagesspiegel.de. Allerdings könne „es vereinzelt zu einer leicht verzögerten Bereitstellung der Selbstbedienungsterminals kommen“.\nDigitales Passfoto erstellen: Auch bei Drogeriekette dm oder Fotografen möglich\nAuch in den übrigen Bundesländern herrschen in vielen Städten unterschiedliche Voraussetzungen in den einzelnen Bürgerämtern. Daher sollte man sich im Zweifel bei den Behördenstandorten informieren, ob dort geeignete Foto-Terminals für das Erstellen digitaler Passfotos vorhanden sind oder nicht. Zudem bleiben als alternative Lösungen Filialen der Drogeriemarktkette dm (Kosten je Passfoto: 5,95 Euro) oder bei einem professionellen Fotografen. Passende Fotostudios finden Sie auf der Website alfo-passbild.com. Hier können die Kosten auch höher liegen. Auch für die Fotografen wird die Umstellung teuer – einige fürchten um ihre Existenz.\nZum Start am 1. Mai sollen laut Bundesinnenministerium zunächst 2.500 Foto-Terminals in den Passbehörden bereitstehen. Bis August soll die Auslieferung von insgesamt 10.000 Systeme dann abgeschlossen sein. Das Ministerium hat auf seinem Personalausweisportal derweil auch eine Idee, was man mit alten, ausgedruckten Passfotos noch machen kann: „Alte Passbilder können Sie als Andenken aufbewahren oder – sofern für andere Zwecke noch hinreichend aktuell – für die Beantragung von Schwimm-, Angler- oder sonstigen Ausweisdokumenten verwenden.“ (kh)",

    "text": "Father and Son Critically Wounded in Attempt to Halt Assault in Kelso\nAndrew Mackinley’s Role in Gibraltar Sovereignty Talks with Tony Blair Revealed\nIn a riveting revelation, former British Member of Parliament, Andrew Mackinley, unveiled his role in a pivotal conversation with Tony Blair, the then-Prime Minister, concerning the contentious issue of joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. The discussion, which took place amid a Labour Party conference, saw Mackinley expressing profound concerns over the potential implications of a joint sovereignty arrangement between the UK and Spain for Gibraltar’s status.\nMackinley-Blair Dialogue on Gibraltar’s Future\nThe dialogue between the two stalwarts highlighted the intricate dynamics of internal politics and their profound influence on international negotiations. Mackinley, an influential figure, emphasized the paramount importance of respecting the wishes of the Gibraltarian people. He argued against the joint sovereignty proposition, a move that was under serious contemplation by the UK government at the time.\nBlair’s Decision to Cease Negotiations\nBlair, known for his pragmatic approach, listened attentively to Mackinley’s arguments. He reflected deeply on the points raised during their exchange. Following this critical dialogue, he made the momentous decision to cease the negotiations on joint sovereignty. This move signaled the UK government’s commitment to Gibraltar’s sovereignty and their recognition of the Gibraltarian people’s sentiments.\nMackinley’s Influence on Gibraltar’s Sovereignty\nMackinley’s intervention is seen as a pivotal moment in the fraught dialogue surrounding Gibraltar’s sovereignty. His conversation with Blair is widely regarded as having influenced the latter’s decision to halt the joint sovereignty talks. The episode underscores the complexity of sovereignty disputes and the significant role played by internal political dynamics in shaping international negotiations.\nAdditionally, Mackinley, a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Gibraltar, shared his thoughts on Brexit and its impact on the UK. He underscored the seismic shifts the political event triggered, demonstrating his acute understanding of the broader geopolitical landscape.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/breaking-news/health/scotland-ponders-over-drug-checking-services-amidst-high-death-rates-study-highlights-key-considerations/",

    "title": "Jack Dorsey's Fintech Firm Block Cuts Over 900 Jobs: \"Want To Give You Straight Facts\"",
    "text": "Block, the financial technology company co-founded by Jack Dorsey, has laid off over 900 people, roughly 8% of the company's staff, on Tuesday, TechCrunch reported. The news was announced to staff in an email from Mr Dorsey himself. In an internal email, he emphasised that the cuts are not financially motivated or aimed at replacing workers with artificial intelligence. Rather, he stated that Block is cutting the roles owing to shifting strategic needs while \"raising the bar and acting faster on performance\". Block owns Cash App and Square. The company provides mobile payments services for consumers, as well as point-of-sale hardware and software for businesses. In the internal email seen by TechCrunch , Mr Dorsey said that the firm is laying off a total of 931 workers - 80 managers, 391 \"off strategy\" workers and 460 workers who the company believes are underperforming. In addition to the layoffs, Mr Dorsey noted that Block is closing 748 open roles at the company, with the exception of those that have progressed to an offer stage, critical operations roles and key leadership roles, among others. He also said that 193 managers are being moved to individual contributor roles. In the email, Mr Dorsey stressed the urgency of the reorganisation, stating that the company has been \"behind in our actions\" and needs to move quickly to stay competitive in a transformative industry moment. The tech entrepreneur also emphasised his commitment to increasing shareholder value and maintaining a \"high bar of correctness\" in organisational decisions.

(and) hierarchy: driving to flattening our org to a max depth of innercore+4,\" Mr Dorsey wrote in the mail. \"none of the above points are trying to hit a specific financial target, replacing folks with AI, or changing our headcount cap. they are specific to our needs around strategy, raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move faster and with less abstraction,\" he continued. Elsewhere in the email, Mr Dorsey stated that \"this is the toughest part of my job\". \"we're working to give clarity to everyone as quickly, with as much context and support, as possible,\" he said. According to TechCrunch , the recent round of layoffs follows a similar restructuring in early 2024, when around 1,000 employees were let go. As of December 2024, the company had around 11,300 staff members worldwide.\n Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world",
