    "text": " The $12 secret to keeping scaredy-dogs calm during winter storms Izabella Zaydenberg · Deputy Editor, Commerce Updated January 3, 2024 at 9:16 PM Link\nAs much as my pup loves winter for obvious reasons — namely, the extra time her humans spend inside out of the cold, and thus snuggled up beside her — she also can’t stand the storms. She’s already a frightful pup; loud noises scare her, and a windy storm is, without fail, a recipe for her running under my bed in panic, or worse, shaking under the nearest table she can find.\nWhile I’ve tried an endless amount of calming treats with varying degrees of efficacy, there’s one that my pup Chloe and I love, and it’s wicked inexpensive: Pet Naturals of Vermont Calming Dog Chews , $12.\nAmazon Pet Naturals Calming Supplements, 30 Chews These chews are sedative-free and won’t tire your pup out — and they last for four to six hours.\n$12 at Amazon Now, they’re no replacement for basic pet parent common sense during storms: I still make sure to close all windows and draw the curtains, keep her safely inside and with her favorite plushies and blankets, either watching a TV show or listening to tail-wagging songs. These treats act as an additional barrier between her and the loud, scary storm noises I know she’ll hear, and they seriously do help.\nBoomer's winter is about to get a whole lot better. (Photo: Getty Images) The chews use a Colostrum Calming Complex Biopepide Blend, L-Theanine and Vitamin B to soothe Chloe without making her sleepy or drowsy. They’re sedative-free and won’t tire her out; they last for four to six hours and start working up to 20 minutes after ingesting. They also reportedly taste delicious, as my furbaby runs straight to me when she sees me opening up the packet. They’re soft and easy to chew, so if your pet is older or has dental issues like Chloe, she’ll have an easier time with this than her kibble.\nGive half a chew for dogs up to 25 pounds, one chew for dogs between 25 and 50 pounds and two chews for dogs 51 to 100 pounds. Increase if needed. (Photo: Amazon) And they're not just for storms: I use mine whenever Chloe's being particularly antsy, like if there’s construction noise, or if she’s about to go to the vet. Other shoppers use them to help combat separation anxiety, jumpiness and even aggression. Another great time to break 'em out? Whenever someone in the neighborhood is setting off fireworks, whether on the Fourth of July or the just-passed New Year's Eve.\nPups that get upset by loud noises particularly benefit from the treat. One shopper gives her little scaredy-dog some before thunderstorms. Says the fan: \" My 55 lb. boxer mix girl will run and hide in the bathroom with no windows or bury her entire body in my pillows when I'm near my bed, trembling violently the whole time, when she hears thunder...We started out trying just one of these, and it did help significantly, along with her Thundershirt, but it works even better if she takes two (sometimes with the Thundershirt, sometimes without). I like to think of it as anti-anxiety medication. When I hear the thunder, I offer these to her, and she knows they help because she chews and swallows them right down.\"\nAnother reviewer offered the calming chews before a long trip:\n“It really works!\" says the shopper . Normally the 30-minute drive to the beach she’s whining, ready to get out and play so we got these for her first four-hour total road trip and along with a seatbelt it was so stress-less. She ate it like it was a treat — no fuss! We only gave her one and it kicked in about 30 minutes later. Our VERY active 1-year-old German will now enjoy more road trips and adventures!\"\nFor just $12, these inexpensive chews are a must-have, and if they save me the heartache of watching Chloe shake all night or worse, running around my neighborhood trying to find her, they're so worth it.\nAmazon Pet Naturals Calming Supplements, 30 Chews These chewies start working within just 20 minutes after ingesting.\n$12 at Amazon The reviews Quote: d above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\nIf you have Amazon Prime , you’ll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here . (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $25 or more.)\nView comments",

    "title": "Arsenal’s title hopes hit as old boy Mavropanos helps West Ham to win | Premier League | The Guardian",
    "text": "This was not the reunion that Arsenal envisaged. On a night when West Ham’s discipline and tremendous work ethic turned the Emirates Stadium into a pit of frustration, Declan Rice found himself powerless to resist as the narrative shifted to the goal from Konstantinos Mavropanos that raises further doubts over his old side’s staying power in the title race.\nMikel Arteta has every reason to be concerned after a defeat that dashed Arsenal’s hopes of returning to the top of the Premier League . Statistics showing his side had 74% possession and finished a taut encounter with 30 shots to West Ham’s five spoke less of their dominance and more to their toothlessness and indecision in the final third. As Arteta acknowledged, supremacy in the middle hardly feels relevant when it is accompanied by such a lack of conviction in both boxes.\nArsenal 0-2 West Ham: Premier League – live reaction\nRead more By full-time Arsenal, who remain two points behind Liverpool and three ahead of Manchester City, had managed 77 touches in West Ham’s area. Two went to Gabriel Jesus, only for the hard-running No 9 to spurn a couple of glorious headed chances midway through the second half.\nThey were pivotal moments, the kind that might have turned the game on its head, but there is a reason why City let Jesus go. Their view was that the striker was not potent enough and, for all the Brazilian’s excellent work off the ball, it is easy to understand the argument about Arsenal needing more firepower in January.\nAt the moment they look reliant on Bukayo Saka, a weakness that West Ham exploited by crowding the winger out. Gabriel Martinelli, who was marked out of the game by the outstanding Vladimir Coufal, is simply not offering any threat on the opposite flank. Martinelli has only two league goals this season and, with Kai Havertz missing through suspension, the use of Leandro Trossard in midfield was not enough to break West Ham down.\nThis was a solid, committed performance from West Ham, who rose to sixth after consecutive 2-0 wins against Arsenal and Manchester United . For David Moyes, who celebrated his first league win in 73 attempts away against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and United, it was a tactical triumph.\nTime to give him a new deal? The evidence is compelling. West Ham may lack glamour but nobody can accuse them of being a soft touch under Moyes. They fought for everything after snatching the lead through Tomas Soucek and, having survived a storm before half-time, were in the clear when Mavropanos, a centre-back who made little impact before leaving Arsenal in 2022, headed in James Ward-Prowse’s corner early in the second half.\nJarrod Bowen keeps the ball in for Tomas Soucek to score. VAR could not confirm the ball was out so the referee’s decision of goal remained. Photograph: Amazon Prime Mavropanos’s first goal since joining West Ham from Stuttgart hit Arsenal hard. They were under pressure after wins for City and Liverpool earlier in the week. They were desperate for an early goal. Martin Ødegaard linked with Saka, who tested Alphonse Areola. Emerson Palmieri, West Ham’s adventurous left-back, would have to dig deep against Saka.\nWest Ham had conceded five in each of their previous two away outings and were without Nayef Aguerd and Kurt Zouma in central defence. Deputising for Aguerd and Zouma were Mavropanos and Angelo Ogbonna, the pairing that started when West Ham were demolished by Liverpool in the Carabao Cup.\nA notable feature, though, was the tenacious Edson Álvarez dropping back to help West Ham’s defence. They soon tiptoed forward. Lucas Paquetá, who had started despite injuring a knee during the warm-up, took over, spinning cleverly before finding Emerson’s overlapping run.\nThe left-back’s cross caught Arsenal out. Jarrod Bowen missed it at the near post but Gabriel Magalhães and Oleksandr Zinchenko were in a muddle. The ball came back to Bowen, who pulled it back from the byline for Soucek to score from close range.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily\nFree daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It grew further when Areola tipped Saka’s header over and Martinelli shot wide.\nWest Ham were hit when Paquetá went down again, depriving the visitors of their most accomplished player on the ball. Retaining possession was harder with Saïd Benrahma on. Arsenal upped the pace. Saka hit woodwork after wriggling through. Soucek and Ogbonna made vital blocks.\n00:01:28\nMikel Arteta admits frustration with Arsenal's inability to score against West Ham – video It had been 45 minutes of pure Moyesball. Mohammed Kudus worked tirelessly on West Ham’s right, tracking back and occasionally relieving pressure with neat footwork. Arsenal struggled to find space. Rice shot over from 20 yards but openings were rare after half-time and the angst grew when Mavropanos, running across Magalhães, met Ward-Prowse’s delivery with a header that went in off the bar.\nArsenal’s response came from Jesus wasting headers and Trossard firing at Areola’s legs. There was time for Rice to concede a penalty for fouling Emerson. David Raya’s save from Benrahma was of little consolation to Arsenal.\nExplore more on these topics Premier League Arsenal West Ham United match reports\nReuse this content",

    "text": "STORY: ::Mexicans feel 'desperate, dizzy and weak' as the country grapples with heat wave hitting 95°F :: Location: Mexico City, Mexico :: Location: Oaxaca City, Mexico :: Date: May 9, 2024 :: Maria De Jesus, Tamale Seller \"It hurts your head, you feel desperate, dizzy, and weak, obviously because of the heat stroke.\" :: Roberto Aguilar, Analyst \"We have gone from a season of drought that has dried up and drained the dams, and there is not enough water for power generation. We have also moved quickly to extreme heat, further stressing the situation. Today, we also see the fires that have manifested this. What we've been seeing historically is high, and I think the rapid deterioration of the environment is a manifestation of that.\" In Mexico City, residents sought relief from the sweltering conditions by bathing in fountains, using fans, and shielding themselves from the sun's relentless rays with umbrellas. A maximum temperature of 33 degrees Celsius (91.4°F) was recorded in the country's capital on Thursday. Meanwhile, the colonial and tourist city of Oaxaca, southern Mexico, has been experiencing high temperatures since the weekend, which have kept the thermometers above 35 degrees Celsius (95°F) with thermal sensations of 40 degrees Celsius (104°F). The scorching sun and a dry environment have forced locals and visitors to wear umbrellas and hats. Mexico is experiencing its second heat wave of the spring season, with temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86°F) across the country. Electricity demand and unseasonably hot weather have caused power outages in at least 15 states, and drought has affected dam levels.",
