    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs Chris Jones lashes out and demands more from Chiefs teammates amid training camp sluggishness It's been a very different preseason for Jones relative to last year\nLapresse JB Actualizado 25/07/2024 - 11:42 CDT\nCompartir en Facebook\nCompartir en Twitter\nCompartir en Telegram\nCompartir en Whatsapp\nEnviar por email NFL. Chris Jones is pleased with the chemistry he has had with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce in training camp NFL. Chiefs going nuclear: Mahomes' deep attack is poised to make history and Andy Reid is happy about it D o you know what makes championship teams successful? Competitive fire, and never letting your guard down. That is the challenge facing the Kansas City Chiefs in 2024 -- a team that, arguably, has the largest target on its back in recent memory.\nThe Chiefs are hoping to play in Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans next February, as they seek to become the first team in NFL history to win the Super Bowl in three consecutive seasons. If winning it once was challenging, and winning it twice took everything Kansas City had, securing the \"three-peat\" is a daunting task -- and Chris Jones wants to make sure his teammates are up for it.\nJones isn't satisfied During a session at training camp this week, Jones laid in to the Chiefs' defensive linemen for their effort. The summer heat wasn't blazing quite like Jones was, and he is proving that his mammoth contract extension hasn't changed him a bit.\nFollowing a holdout last summer that bled into the regular season, Jones re-upped with Kansas City this spring, signing a contract that could be worth nearly $160 million if he hits every clause in it. The three-time Super Bowl champion and two-time All-Pro wants to keep winning -- and he is not afraid to get in his teammates' faces about it.\nWhether the players loved this energy hasn't been conclusively proven -- but Chiefs fans sure enjoyed the tongue-lashing. Jones was described as a \"leader of men\" by a fan on X/Twitter , indicative of the high esteem in which the 30-year-old is held in Kansas City. He is driven to lift everyone around him -- and with back-to-back double-digit sack seasons on his resume, Jones' teammates would be wise to listen to him.",

    "text": "Manchester City striker Vivianne Miedema stunned Chelsea as Sonia Bompastor’s 28-game unbeaten run came to an end in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie at Joie Stadium.\nIn a fairly drab replay of Sunday’s League Cup final – which Chelsea won 2-1 – City made a breakthrough after Miedema came on at half-time and broke the deadlock after 60 minutes.\nFollowing the goal, Chelsea looked to have shifted their mentality and managed to gain some momentum in the final third with Mayra Ramirez scoring a goal which would instantly be ruled out for offside.\nAnd, with 80 minutes gone, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd smashed the frame of the goal with a powerful, close-ranged effort.\nFortunately for City, the visitors couldn’t force an equaliser as Miedema doubled her scoring to put her side two goals up with mere minutes left to play as the pressure now stands with the visitors when the second leg is played at Stamford Bridge next week.\nStory of the Match\nNick Cushing was perhaps the best replacement for Gareth Taylor given the silverware he won with the club during his first spell in charge – including their only Women’s Super League title triumph in 2016.\nBut he will need to prove to the board that he is worthy of the permanent role through a test of several tough fixtures ahead.\nBefore the knockout rounds began, City had won five of their six group stage games and boasted a 100% record at the Joie Stadium in the Women’s Champions League.\nAnd after an hour of football here, with a lot of aimless attempts on goal, substitute Miedema opened the scoring with an emphatic strike towards goal.\nInitially, Mary Fowler had collected the ball on the edge of the area after it was cleared from a corner before cutting across Sjoeke Nusken and sending a perfectly weighted cross towards Laia Aleixandri who was waiting in the box.\nThe City captain managed to get a good connection on the ball with a header and Hampton, using her incredible reflexes, managed to push the ball onto the crossbar before Miedema, standing on the left side of the box, finished the rebound off to give City a well-deserved advantage.\nThe 28-year-old then doubled her side’s lead when she met Kerolin’s short pass before firing a left-footed strike into the bottom left corner of Hampton’s net.\nAnd to make matters worse for Chelsea, Ramirez managed to finish off a slick run of play when Aggie Beaver-Jones sent the forward through on goal, but it was ruled out for offside shortly after as Bompastor’s 28-game unbeaten run looked to be in jeopardy.\nJust four minutes after her goal, Miedema found herself on the counter again, but struggled in getting past Millie Bright – and instead shooting from the edge of the area, which was saved rather easily by Hannah Hampton.\nThe hosts were much more creative than their counterpart in the opening half but couldn’t seem to pair that with the clinicalness needed to make a difference in front of goal.\nThe most promising chance was the first of the game when Kerolin – who joined City from North Carolina Courage in January – took aim from the edge of the area before her effort floated narrowly over the bar.\nTwenty-six minutes later there was another chance for City as 18-year-old Lily Murphy found space down the left before cutting the ball onto her right foot.\nFrom there, the midfielder fired towards the bottom left corner but Hampton made a strong, low stop to prevent an early opener.\nChelsea’s start to the second period was much better than that of the first as Lauren James managed to dispatch a left-footed strike towards the bottom right corner and, if it wasn’t for Ayaka Yamashita’s intuition, the visitors could have taken the lead.",

    "text": "Exclusive: Recordings, emails show how Trump team flew fake elector ballots to DC in final push to overturn 2020 election\nCNN\nBy Marshall Cohen, Zachary Cohen, Jeremy Herb and Katelyn Polantz, CNN\n(CNN) — Two days before the\nJanuary 6 insurrection, the Trump campaign’s plan to use fake electors to block President-elect Joe Biden from taking office faced a potentially crippling hiccup: The fake elector certificates from two critical battleground states were stuck in the mail.\nSo, Trump campaign operatives scrambled to fly copies of the\nphony certificates from Michigan and Wisconsin to the nation’s capital, relying on a haphazard chain of couriers, as well as help from two Republicans in Congress, to try to get the documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence while he presided over the Electoral College certification.\nThe operatives even considered chartering a jet to ensure the files reached Washington, DC, in time for the January 6, 2021, proceeding, according to emails and recordings obtained by CNN.\nThe new details provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the chaotic last-minute effort to keep Donald Trump in office. The fake electors scheme features prominently in special counsel Jack Smith’s\ncriminal indictment against the former president, and some of the officials who were involved have spoken to Smith’s investigators.\nThe emails and recordings also indicate that a top Trump campaign lawyer was part of 11th-hour discussions about delivering the fake elector certificates to Pence, potentially undercutting his testimony to the House select committee that investigated January 6 that he had passed off responsibility and didn’t want to put the former vice president in a difficult spot.\nThese details largely come from pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who was an architect of the fake electors plot and is now a\nkey cooperator in several state probes into the scheme. Chesebro pleaded guilty in October to a felony conspiracy charge in Georgia in connection with the electors’ plan, and has met with prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, who are investigating the sham GOP electors in their own states.\nChesebro is an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal election interference indictment against Trump.\nCNN has obtained audio of Chesebro’s recent interview with Michigan investigators, and\nexclusively reported earlier this month that he also told them about a December 2020 Oval Office meeting where he briefed Trump about the fake electors plan and how it ties into January 6.\nAn attorney for Chesebro declined to comment. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office did not reply to a request for comment for this story.\n‘A high-level decision’\nEmails obtained by CNN corroborate what Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors: He communicated with the top Trump campaign lawyer, Matt Morgan, and another campaign official,\nMike Roman, to ferry the documents to Washington on January 5.\nFrom there,\nSen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and a Pennsylvania congressman assisted in the effort to get the documents into Pence’s hands.\n“This is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there,” Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors. “And they had to enlist, you know, a US senator to try to expedite it, to get it to Pence in time.”\nChesebro also discussed the episode with Wisconsin investigators last week when he sat for an interview with the attorney general’s office as part of a separate state probe into the fake electors plot, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\nWisconsin prosecutors asked about the episode “extensively,” the source said, noting Chesebro discussed how a Wisconsin GOP staffer flew the certificate from Milwaukee to Washington and then handed it off to Chesebro.\nThe firsthand account from Chesebro’s perspective helps fill in the narrative behind the effort to hand-deliver elector slates to Pence, which is vaguely referenced in Smith’s federal indictment.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include conspiring with Chesebro and others to obstruct the January 6 certification proceeding. Before Chesebro’s guilty plea in Georgia, his attorneys reached out to Smith’s team. As of this week, he has not heard back from federal prosecutors, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\nFederal investigators have\nspoken with several individuals involved in the scramble with the phony elector certificates, according to a source familiar with the matter. This includes interviews with Trump staffers who were tapped to fly the papers to DC, and some fake electors who knew of the planning.\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment.\nAsked about the episode, a spokesperson for Johnson pointed to his\nprevious comments, where he said, “my involvement in that attempt to deliver spanned the course of a couple seconds,” and that, “in the end, those electors were not delivered.”\n‘Day-by-day’ coordination\nAccording to the recordings of Chesebro’s sit-down with Michigan prosecutors, he explained how a legal memo he wrote for Wisconsin transformed into a\nnationwide operation, where Trump lawyers were “day-by-day coordinating the efforts of more than a dozen people with the GOP and with the Trump campaign.”\nOn January 4, 2021, Morgan sent an email to Chesebro and Roman asking for confirmation that all of the Trump elector slates had been received by Congress, according to the documents obtained by CNN.\nRoman responded that the Michigan certificate had been mailed on December 15 but was still “in transit” at a US Postal Service facility in DC. Wisconsin’s certificate also had apparently not arrived.\nChesebro told prosecutors that Morgan was “freaked out” when the campaign realized the phony certificates from Michigan were still in the mail.\nThat same day, Morgan weighed in over email asking Chesebro and Roman to rethink how they would deliver the certificates to Pence.\n“As I thought about this more, a courier will not be able to access the Capitol to deliver a sealed package,” Morgan wrote on January 4, according to emails obtained by CNN “You will probably need to enlist the help of a legislator who can deliver to the appropriate place(s). I strongly recommend you guys discuss a revised delivery plan with Rudy (Giuliani) to make sure this gets done the way he wants.”\n‘Can we charter a flight?’\nRoman was concerned the Wisconsin documents wouldn’t reach Washington in time.\n“Can we charter a flight? The only available commercial from MKE (Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport) to DCA (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) arrives at 2130 tomorrow night,” Roman wrote to Chesebro on January 4 at 11:24 p.m.\nThe job of physically flying the elector documents to Washington fell to two people: A Trump campaign staffer and a Wisconsin GOP official, according to the emails and what Chesebro told prosecutors.\nThe Wisconsin GOP official who had that state’s elector documents landed after 10 a.m. on January 5 at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, according to the emails.\nTrump campaign aide Michael Brown flew with the Michigan certificates to Washington National Airport with a scheduled arrival around 1 p.m., according to emails obtained by CNN. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Brown flew to DC from Atlanta, because the Trump staffers who had custody of the Michigan ballots were in Georgia for the\nSenate runoffs.\nThe campaign booked and paid for Brown’s flight on Southwest Airlines, the source said. Federal campaign finance records indicate that a pro-Trump super PAC paid the airline on the day of Brown’s flight for travel related to election “recount” efforts.\nTrump Hotel meetup\nThe emails show that Brown and the Wisconsin GOP official were instructed to meet Chesebro at the\nTrump International Hotel in downtown Washington to hand off the fake elector certificates. Chesebro said in an email that he’d keep the ballots in his hotel room safe until it was time to pass them along.\nWisconsin Republican Party officials were annoyed at the request to courier the fake elector certificates to Washington. “Freaking trump idiots want someone to fly original elector papers to the senate President,” a Wisconsin GOP official wrote to then-state party chairman Andrew Hitt on January 4, according to the January 6 committee report.\nHitt – who has provided information to federal investigators about the efforts to get the fake elector certificates to Washington, according to a source familiar with the matter –\ntold the January 6 committee that the couriering ended up being overkill, because the original documents that the state party had mailed to Washington actually made it in time.\nGetting the certificates inside the Capitol\nThe documents still had to be hand-delivered to Pence’s Senate office in the Capitol.\nThe electors plot – as envisioned by Chesebro and other Trump allies – was that Pence could reject Biden’s legitimate electors and recognize Trump’s “alternate electors” on January 6, while lawmakers tallied the electoral votes from each state. Per federal law, the certificates need to be physically presented on the floor of Congress during the joint session, while lawmakers tally the electoral votes.\nChesebro told investigators that Roman connected him with an aide for a Pennsylvania GOP lawmaker that he believed was Rep. Scott Perry to turn over the documents. Chesebro wasn’t certain which congressman the staffer worked for – and the January 6 report says a staffer for a different Pennsylvania Republican, Rep. Mike Kelly, helped shuttle the documents that day.\n“I had the Wisconsin stuff. [Trump campaign aide] Mike Brown had the Michigan stuff. We walked to the Longworth Office Building, and the guy with Perry, or whatever his name is, and some other fellow, that were like staff members of the House, took them and said, ‘We’re going to walk them over to the Senate and give it to a Senate staffer,’” Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors, according to the audio obtained by CNN.\n“I don’t know why logistically we didn’t take it directly to Johnson. But that’s how we did it,” he added.\nKelly and Perry’s offices did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\nBrown did not comment for this story.\nCNN previously reported that he testified in June to Smith’s grand jury in the Trump election subversion probe.\nCNN previously reported that Roman\nsat for a proffer interview with Smith’s team before Trump was indicted. He was also indicted in the sweeping Georgia election racketeering case, in connection with the fake electors scheme, and has pleaded not guilty.\nRoman’s attorney did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nThe details from Chesebro put a finer point on how members of Congress, including a sitting US senator, were involved in making sure the electoral certificates for Trump ended up in Pence’s hands.\nThe January 6 committee first revealed last year Johnson’s involvement in trying unsuccessfully to deliver the fake elector certificates to Pence, who\nannounced on the morning of the joint session that it would be unconstitutional to do what Trump wanted and unilaterally overturn the election results.\nThe committee\nrevealed text messages during their hearings last year that Johnson aide Sean Riley sent to Pence aide Chris Hodgson, saying that Johnson “needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise.”\n“What is it?” Hodgson asked.\n“Alternate slates of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Riley responded.\n“Do not give that to him,” Hodgson said.\n‘F**k these guys’\nIn his Michigan interview, Chesebro also dished on some of the internal disagreements among the Trump lawyers, campaign officials and other allies, who clashed over the purpose of the electors’ plan and how far to take things on January 6.\nChesebro has maintained – then, and now – that the plan was a lawful move to preserve Trump’s legal rights.\nEven before the Trump electors met in their state capitals on December 14, 2020, to cast their fake ballots and sign the certificates, Chesebro heard about concerns from some of the electors about possible legal jeopardy, according to emails and text messages reported by\nthe Detroit News and obtained by CNN.\nChesebro\nadded hedging language for the faux certificates from Pennsylvania and New Mexico in response to those concerns. He proposed to Roman and Morgan that they add the contingency caveats to the paperwork for all seven states in the plan. But Roman rejected the idea, according to the emails.\n“F**k these guys,” Roman texted Chesebro on December 12, 2020.\nBy this time, the Trump campaign had essentially cleaved in two. Top officials who had managed day-to-day activity for Trump up to the election, including in court, say they ceded responsibility to Rudy Giuliani and others, such as Chesebro, according to congressional testimony transcripts. Roman effectively switched teams to work under Giuliani’s structure, according to the testimony from Morgan and others.\nA spokesperson for Giuliani did not reply to a request for comment.\n‘It really went south on me’\nChesebro told Michigan investigators that his own emails show that Morgan remained deeply involved, including in the final hours before January 6, to ensure that the certificates reached DC.\n“I don’t have a really warm feeling toward, at least, the top Trump lawyers that did this, hid from me what they were doing and then lied to Congress about me. So, it’s been really difficult,” Chesebro said.\nIn his congressional testimony, Morgan said he knew of the elector plan but wanted to distance himself from the effort, delegating the work to others, including those under Giuliani.\nMorgan told the January 6 committee last year that he initially believed the electors were only meant to be used as a contingency. The electors, he believed, should meet in their state capitals and cast their electoral votes but “not necessarily submit” the certificates to Congress unless “we prevailed” in court.\nMorgan told the committee that the plan changed in December, saying it morphed from a “cast-and-hold” operation and had “shifted to cast-and-send.” And that’s when Morgan told the committee that he backed out, testifying that he directed an aide to “email Mr. Chesebro politely to say, ‘this is your task. You are responsible for the Electoral College issues moving forward.’”\n“This was my way of taking that responsibility to zero,” Morgan told the committee, later adding that he “moved on” after that email was sent.\nMorgan explained that he was concerned that the new plan to try to count the fake electors on January 6 “would make the Vice President’s life harder, and I didn’t want to be a part of that.”\n“Mr. Morgan stands by his congressional testimony,” his defense attorneys told CNN in response to his emails and Chesebro’s statements to investigators.\nUltimately, on the eve of the joint session of Congress, Morgan helped get the ballots in place, according to the emails and according to Chesebro, who blamed his legal troubles squarely on the Trump campaign’s legal team.\n“I could have avoided all this,” Chesebro vented to Michigan prosecutors. “It’s been a real lesson in not working with people that you don’t know and are not sure you can trust, because it really went south on me.”\nCNN’s Avery Lotz, Annie Klingenberg, Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Today in History for Dec. 29: In 1170, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was murdered on the altar of Canterbury Cathedral by knights of King Henry II. In 1813, the British burned Buffalo, N.Y., during the War of 1812. In 1837, the American ship \"Caroline,\" which had been supplying William Lyon Mackenzie's rebels, was set on fire by the British and sent over Niagara Falls. At least one American was killed and a difficult diplomatic impasse between Britain and the United States followed. In 1845, Texas became a U.S. state. In 1851, the first American Young Men's Christian Association was organized, in Boston. In 1877, employees of Canada's Grand Trunk Railroad went on strike, in support of members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers who had been fired. The strike was broken by the use of militia and non-union workers. In 1890, the last battle in the American-Indian wars took place at Wounded Knee Creek, S.D. About 350 half-starved Sioux gathered on the Pine Ridge Reservation for a Ghost Dance, a religious ceremony in which the Indians believed their dead would rise again and lead them to good hunting grounds. When the Sioux refused to hand over their weapons to the 7th Cavalry, the troops opened fire. About 150 Indians, half of them women and children, and 25 soldiers, died in the battle. In 1908, the first gold coin and sovereigns were minted in Canada. In 1916, Grigory Rasputin, the so-called \"Mad Monk\" who'd wielded great influence with Czar Nicholas II, was murdered by a group of Russian noblemen in St. Petersburg. In 1919, Sir William Osler, who's been called the most influential physician in history, died in Oxford, England at age 70. Known as \"the father of clinical medicine,\" the Ontario native was a pioneer in emphasizing a patient's state of mind in achieving a cure. His 1892 medical text, \"The Principles and Practice of Medicine,\" was considered authoritative for over three decades. In 1921, William Lyon Mackenzie King succeeded Arthur Meighen as prime minister of Canada. King led the Liberal party for 25 years and was prime minister for more than 21 years. He resigned from office in 1948 at age 74. He died on July 22, 1950. In 1934, Japan formally denounced the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. In 1940, German aircraft dropped thousands of incendiary bombs on central London during the Second World War, causing the worst fire damage in the British capital since the Great Fire of 1666. St. Paul's Cathedral survived, but eight other ancient churches were badly damaged. In 1944, Canadian pilot Dick Audet shot down five enemy planes in 10 seconds during the Second World War. In 1952, a six-kilogram kidney stone was removed from an 80-year old woman by a doctor in London, England. At the time, it was the largest recorded in medical history. In 1967, Parliament abolished the death penalty, except for the killing of prison guards or police officers, for a five-year trial period. The legislation was renewed in 1973, before hanging was totally abolished in 1976. Canada's last executions were in 1962. In 1969, European industries and services were paralyzed by a major influenza epidemic. In 1970, Roy Ivor, 91, internationally known naturalist, lost his bird sanctuary at Mississauga, Ont., in a fire. In 1972, an Eastern Airlines TriStar jet crashed on approach to Miami International Airport, killing 101 people. In 1975, 11 people were killed and 74 injured when a bomb exploded in a baggage claim area at the La Guardia airport in New York. In 1981, U.S. President Ronald Reagan imposed trade sanctions on the Soviet Union to protest the imposition of martial law in Poland following the rise of Solidarity, the independent trade union movement. In 1989, Canada became the first country to ban smoking on domestic flights. In 1989, writer Vaclav Havel was elected as president of the Czech Republic as politicians voted to end the Communist party's 40-year monopoly of power. In 1991, Susan Wright, one of Canada's best-known stage actresses, died in Stratford, Ont., at age 44. In 1992, Fernando Collor de Mello resigned as president of Brazil minutes before the opening of his impeachment trial. In 1996, distinguished Canadian poet Dorothy Livesay died at age 87. In 1998, four tourists, including one Canadian, were killed by their kidnappers after Yemeni troops stormed a remote mountain hideaway where they were being held by Islamic extremists. In 2008, Israel called an \"all-out war\" against Hamas as its air attacks killed more than 300 people in Gaza in three days, the bloodiest fighting between Israelis and Palestinians since the 1967 war. In 2008, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina won a landslide victory in Bangladesh’s first election in seven years. In 2008, Canada's junior hockey team won The Canadian Press team of the year for its gold medal win at the World Jr. Championship. In 2009, Const. Eric Czapnik, 51, was stabbed to death outside an Ottawa Hospital, becoming the first Ottawa police officer to die in the line of duty since 1983. A Mountie under suspension was arrested in the attack. (In 2012, Kevin Gregson was found guilty of first-degree murder.) In 2009, China executed a British man (Akmal Shaikh) convicted of drug smuggling in its first execution of a European citizen in half a century. In 2010, police in Denmark and Sweden halted an imminent terrorist attack by arresting five men who planned to shoot as many people as possible at the Jyllands-Posten newspaper's Copenhagen newsdesk, which published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005. In 2011, Jennifer Heil, Canada's most successful female freestyle skier, was named The Canadian Press female athlete of the year. She ended her career earlier in the year with an unexpected sweep of the moguls and dual moguls gold medals at the world championships. In 2011, fed-up voters in Jamaica threw out the ruling party and delivered a landslide triumph to the opposition People's National Party and its leader, former Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller. In 2013, Michael Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula One history, suffered a serious head injury while skiing in the French Alpine resort of Meribel. The German driver was placed in a medically induced coma. In June 2014, he left a French hospital no longer in a coma and transferred to neighbouring Switzerland to continue his recovery. In 2017, Canada lost 4-3 in a shootout to the United States in international hockey's first outdoor game in Orchard Park, N.Y. In 2018, the first North Atlantic right whale calf of the winter season was spotted off the Florida coast heading north with its mother, a known resident of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said on Facebook that the two endangered whales were sighted near the mouth of the state's St. Johns River. In 2020, Independent Sen. Elaine McCoy, who was appointed to the chamber in 2005 after a career in Alberta politics, died at the age of 74. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney paid tribute to McCoy, calling her a persuasive and unapologetic advocate for the province's workers and energy sector. In 2021, Rideau Hall released the names of the 135 newest additions to the Order of Canada. Among the list of recipients was former senator Murray Sinclair, the noted Indigenous advocate who chaired the Truth and Reconciliation Commission into residential schools. Also on the list was author Yann Martel, known for his book ``Life of Pi'' released two decades ago. In 2021, Damian Warner beat out sprinter Andre De Grasse and soccer star Alphonso Davies to win the Lionel Conacher award as The Canadian Press male athlete of the year. The 32-year-old from London, Ont., won decathlon gold in dominating fashion at the Tokyo Olympics. In 2021, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted of helping American financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls. The verdict capped a month-long trial featuring sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14, told by four women who described being abused as teens. In 2021, a Canadian woman was among seven people in custody in Hong Kong after police raided an online pro-democracy news organization. Two male editors who worked at Stand News were charged with conspiracy to publish a seditious publication, a day after the outlet said it would cease operations following the Wednesday morning raid. Five others being detained for questioning included Hong Kong-born-Canadian pop singer and board member Denise Ho. In 2021, Canada's border agency temporarily closed two ports of entry in the Atlantic region due to COVID-19. The CBSA said the affected offices were in Bathurst, New Brunswick and Charlottetown, P.E.I. Spokeswoman Judith Gadbois-St-Cyr said service at the small offices was being suspended because of COVID infections and close contacts among staff. ---- The Canadian Press",

    "title": "The Bank of England's forecasting record has been lamentable, says ALEX BRUMMER | This is Money",
    "text": "Here is something we can all identify with. Economics was labelled the ‘dismal science’ by the essayist Thomas Carlyle way back in the 19th Century. Nothing seems to have changed. Both its forecasting record and its doom-laden predictions are proving dismally off the mark. When the Bank of England was given its independence in 1997, one of the architects Ed Balls was keen that it become an economic powerhouse, achieving the same respect earned by the German Bundesbank. Lord Mervyn King, as deputy governor and then governor, sought to make this happen. In spite of the history of Cambridge economics, exemplified by John Maynard Keynes, King bemoaned the fact that Britain was simply not producing enough PhD economists and had to look to Italy for recruitment. Blinkered: Instead of being regarded as a font of wisdom he Bank of England has become a byword for poor forecasting and groupthink The Bundesbank’s reputation as an economic powerhouse diminished as responsibility transferred to the European Central Bank thanks to the late Jacques Delors. By locating the ECB in Frankfurt and stuffing it with Bundesbank exiles it was imagined that monetary orthodoxy would remain intact. Over almost a quarter of a century the German grip has been diluted, often leaving the Bundesbank as a dissident shouting from the sidelines. As for the Bank of England, in spite of the heavy investment in economics, its forecasting record has been lamentable. Instead of being regarded as a font of wisdom it has become a byword for poor forecasting and groupthink. Last month it was criticised by the House of Lords economic affairs committee (which includes Lord King) for failing to see the arrival of ‘high and persistent inflation since 2021’ and a lack of diversity of views on the Monetary Policy Committee. The Bank’s Court, its non-executive dominated board, had already recognised the shortcoming and called in former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to mark its forecasting homework. Just so the Bank doesn’t feel put upon, it is worth noting that it has not been alone in crass judgments about the UK. Under the leadership of Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund predicted that Brexit would be ‘pretty bad to very, very bad’ for the British economy. Even devoted opponents of Brexit would have to admit that aside from prolonged queues at passport controls and laborious customs inspections it hasn’t been that awful. Indeed, latest assessments by independent forecasters, such as audit and consultancy firm PwC, suggest that in 2024 UK growth will outpace several of its European competitors. The opposition Labour and Lib Dem parties continue to insist that the Tories ‘crashed the economy.’ Yes, for a few short weeks after the Liz Truss experiment in freewheeling economics, it was ghastly. But one has yet to hear the Labour leadership acknowledge that the UK subsequently outperformed expectations and data failed to record the resilience of post-pandemic output by 2 per cent or £50billion. It is not just the UK forecasts which have been fallacious. The Economist magazine recalls that 2023 was a bad year for economics more generally. There was huge pessimism about America and the likelihood of recession. Instead the US economy powered ahead by an estimated 2.4 per cent. That should not be a great surprise given the fiscal boost of Bidenomics and more than a decade of monetary largesse. Several studies have challenged well-entrenched precepts. It has long been thought that the US would be a richer place were more homes to be built around growing cities. Not true, argue economists at the University of Washington. It has been widely assumed that social mobility has declined in recent decades in the US. That too is false news. There is much more opportunity than in the past to bypass the birth lottery. In Britain forecasting groups such as the Resolution Foundation and social action organisations such as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation bang on about social inequality: a rising gap between rich and poor. Certainly, at the very bottom of income scale higher energy and food bills have caused pain. Office for National Statistics data shows that on some measures income inequality has been falling by 0.2 per cent a year. Similar patterns are seen in the US in spite of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Who could have guessed that so much of our economic narrative is plain wrong.",

    "text": "The location and function of the pancreas make it a difficult cancer to treat. Scientists are to receive almost £100,000 from a cancer research charity to search for a blood test to detect pancreatic cancer. Cancer Research UK said that currently the majority of people with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is difficult to treat. As a result, pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer death across the UK. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh, led by Dr Marta Canel, will receive £97,289 from Cancer Research UK and hope to find a way to detect pancreatic cancer earlier when it can be more effectively treated. Dr Canel’s team will focus on particular genes called KRAS, SMAD4 and CDKN2A, which when altered cause cancer cells to divide and grow out of control. The team aims to understand how the variations on these genes affect biomarkers – biological evidence in the blood that indicate cancer is present. A blood test would reduce the need for invasive diagnostic biopsies which are particularly difficult given the location and vital function of the pancreas in creating insulin to regulate sugar in the bloodstream and aid digestion. Such a test would also allow screening for the most at risk group including older people and people who develop type 2 diabetes later in life. Dr Canel said: “The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed at an advanced disease stage, by which time treatment options are limited and prognosis is extremely poor. “Relatively low incidence means many GPs will only see a new patient with pancreatic cancer every five years, and with symptoms overlapping with more common health conditions, initial diagnosis can be difficult. “Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at an early stage when surgery remains possible and treatment more effective is critical to patients.” Developing a blood test for diagnosis has been a key focus for pancreatic cancer research, however no biomarker has so far been identified which provides for a robust, reliable blood test. Previous research by the team identified markers in the blood which can be detected when tumours are driven by specific genetic changes. The majority of pancreatic cancer patients have tumours driven by a KRAS mutation, in addition to a number of genetic variations which can shape pancreatic cancer tumours. Scientists said that fully mapping these could pave the way for tailored testing (known as precision medicine) for individual patients. Dr Catherine Elliott, director of research at Cancer Research UK, said: “Precision medicine is a growing area of cancer research. “We hope this research will provide valuable new insights into pancreatic cancer and provide hope for patients to access earlier and more effective treatment in future.” The Edinburgh team also hopes its research may pinpoint vulnerabilities in pancreatic cancer which could be targeted by existing or new treatments such as immunotherapy which is not currently available for pancreatic cancer. The location and function of the pancreas make it a difficult cancer to treat. Currently, only surgery normally offers effective treatment and only if the disease is caught in time.",
