    "title": "FFRF calls out Ala. state senator’s pro-indoctrination remarks",
    "text": "The Freedom From Religion Foundation is responding to Alabama state Senator Greg Reed’s recent comments in support of school-sponsored religious indoctrination.\nAfter FFRF wrote to the\nEtowah County Schools demanding that religious organizations no longer be allowed to proselytize students, Reed issued a statement defending the use of public schools to push Christianity onto students. The program in question involves a “barter arrangement” whereby churches were solicited to supply wrestlers in the middle and high school with water and granola bars. In exchange, the churches were invited to share a 15-minute “devotional” with students.\nReed protested:\nThis week we are celebrating the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him goes all the praise and all the glory. That should be our focus, and it should not be interrupted by out-of-state groups trying to push faith out of our lives and the lives of our children…We need more children, not less, to hear the good news of God’s saving grace.\n“Senator Reed, your remarks are alarming and a breach of your oath to support the U.S. Constitution, which protects students from religious indoctrination by their public schools,” writes FFRF Staff Attorney\nChris Line.\nPublic school students are a vulnerable and captive audience when participating in school-sponsored activities, FFRF noted. Parents, not public schools, have the right to determine their children’s religious or nonreligious upbringing. Additionally, offering access to students for proselytization by outside churches as part of a school program violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\nFFRF takes constitutional violations very seriously, and is willing to vigorously defend students' rights of conscience.\nFFRF recently settled a lawsuit against a school district in West Virginia after it similarly allowed a preacher to recruit students during the school day.\nFFRF terms Reed’s use of his public office to not only promote his personal religious beliefs but also to champion a flagrant constitutional violation an abuse of public trust. As state senator, it is his duty to support the U.S. Constitution, including its Establishment Clause separating religion from government, and to protect the rights of conscience of all Alabamians regardless of their religious or nonreligious beliefs. In the face of an active campaign by Christian nationalists to declare the United States a Christian nation, and undo many First Amendment protections as well as other civil liberties, his statements are profoundly unAmerican.\n“Our public schools exist to educate, not to indoctrinate in religion,” comments FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor. “Senator Reed should take a minute to read our godless Constitution and refresh himself on constitutional principles mandating that the government and its schools stay out of the religion business.”\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation is a national nonprofit organization with more than 40,000 members across the country, including hundreds of members in Alabama. Our purposes are to protect the constitutional principle of separation between state and church and to educate the public on matters relating to nontheism.",

    "text": "OAN’s\nJames Meyers\n11:13 AM – Friday, May 10, 2024\nTexas saw hail that was the “size of baseballs” on Thursday, as severe weather has left over 200,000 people without power and prompted cleanup operations.\nFootage captured from Johnston City, Texas, showed giant hailstones that were at least five inches in diameter, which is large enough to break an SUV’s rear window. One discovered hailstone was an estimated 6.25 inches across, which would make the second largest hailstone ever found in the state of Texas.\nSince 1950, there have only been four verified hailstones over six inches.\nA spokesperson for the city of San Marcos said that they received “reports of downed power lines and uprooted trees” due to Thursday’s storm.\nThe hail comes after severe thunderstorms and tornadoes wreaked havoc on the Midwest, and then through the Southeast this week, resulting in at least three deaths due to the massive storms.\nClose to 95,000 Alabama residents were without power as of 7 a.m. ET, as well as 57,000 in Mississippi, according to PowerOutage.us. Georgia and North Carolina each had around 17,000 power outages.\nMedic Lydia Torres told NBC News Dallas-Fort Worth that the sound of hail landing on her ambulance was like a bomb.\n“It sounded like bombs were hitting the top of the ambulance. Especially when it hit the top of the windshield, you could see the glass start to shatter everywhere,” she said.\nHowever, the majority of outages are in Florida, where 197,405 are experiencing power outages. Northern parts of the Sunshine State have received severe thunderstorms that could turn into tornadoes, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.\n“Damaging to destructive winds, isolated tornadoes, and large hail will be the main threats,” the National Weather Service in Tallahassee reported. “Heavy rainfall could also become a concern if redevelopment and training of storms occurs behind this complex of storms this afternoon.”\nMeanwhile, next week flash flooding is a major concern along the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, where between five and seven inches of rain is expected.\nStay informed!

    "text": "Mongolia’s Economic Crossroads: A Path Beyond Mining Mongolia must diversify its economy beyond mining to ensure sustainable growth. A World Bank report highlights the challenges and opportunities, suggesting a focus on high-productivity service sectors. [CoE-EDP, VisionRI](/Home/AuthorArticles?fl=CoE-EDP, VisionRI)| Updated: 19-07-2024 12:36 IST | Created: 19-07-2024 12:36 IST Mongolia’s economy has long been synonymous with its abundant mineral wealth. From vast coal deposits to rich veins of gold and copper, the nation’s resources have fueled growth and helped reduce poverty. Yet, as the 21st century progresses, Mongolia stands at a pivotal juncture. A recent report by the World Bank, titled “Diversification Paths: What Can Mongolia Learn from the Export Trends of Other Resource-Dependent Countries,” by Gordon Betcherman and Mohammad Muaz Jalil, the time has come for Mongolia to chart a new course toward a more diversified and sustainable economic future. The Heavy Weight of Minerals For years, Mongolia’s economy has leaned heavily on its mining sector. Minerals account for a substantial portion of the country’s GDP, exports, and government revenues. This dependence, however, is not without its risks. The volatility of global commodity prices, environmental concerns, and the inevitable decline in demand from major buyers like China pose significant challenges to the sustainability of this growth model. The report highlights these issues, pointing out that while mining has historically driven Mongolia’s development, the sector alone cannot ensure long-term prosperity. Challenges and Opportunities in Diversification Diversifying away from a resource-dependent economy is no small feat. Many developing nations, particularly those rich in natural resources, struggle with this transition due to limited economic complexity and transferable skills. The World Bank report underscores these challenges, emphasizing the need for structural changes that shift focus from low-productivity activities to high-productivity sectors, notably industry and services. The Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework (GIFF) is employed in the report to analyze export trends in countries similar to Mongolia but at a slightly higher level of development. This methodology reveals both the hurdles and potential pathways for Mongolia’s diversification. The experiences of countries like Chile, Kazakhstan, Russia, Malaysia, Australia, and Canada provide valuable insights into what Mongolia might expect on its journey. Lessons from Comparator Countries The report’s analysis of these comparator nations offers a mixed bag of lessons: Chile has seen its export basket become even more concentrated on resources, particularly copper, over the past two decades. Kazakhstan remains heavily reliant on oil and gas, with little evidence of significant diversification into industrial exports. Russia continues to dominate in oil and gas exports, showing minimal movement toward a more varied industrial sector. Malaysia, however, presents a more positive example, with a relatively diversified export basket that includes significant industrial products, although still reliant on resources. Australia and Canada also demonstrate a high dependency on resource exports, despite being more developed. While these nations illustrate the difficulties of moving away from resource dependency, they also highlight potential areas of growth, particularly in high-productivity and tradable services. A Promising Future in Services One of the report’s most optimistic findings is the potential for Mongolia to develop its high-productivity service sectors. Comparators like Malaysia have shown that investing in services such as business services, telecommunications, and information technology can offer viable paths for diversification. These sectors not only provide new economic opportunities but also align well with Mongolia’s existing capabilities and geographic constraints. Strategic Recommendations To navigate this complex transition, the report offers several strategic recommendations: Leverage Existing Capabilities: Focus on sectors where Mongolia has natural comparative advantages. Develop policies to attract global investors and scale up self-discovery in these sectors. Address Constraints: Identify and remove binding constraints that hinder diversification. Strengthen intangible capital, such as human development and economic complexity. Promote High-Productivity Services: Invest in high-productivity and tradable services. Explore opportunities in business services, telecommunications, and information services. Mongolia’s path to economic diversification is fraught with challenges but also filled with potential. By learning from the experiences of other resource-dependent countries and focusing on high-productivity service sectors, Mongolia can build a more resilient and sustainable economy. The World Bank report provides a roadmap, urging Mongolia to take bold steps towards a diversified future. - FIRST PUBLISHED IN: - Devdiscourse ALSO READ [Dollar Weakens Amid Slowing U.S. Economy, Yen Hits 38-Year Low](/article/headlines/3005616-dollar-weakens-amid-slowing-us-economy-yen-hits-38-year-low) [Iran's Fuel Price Debate: Economy, Protests, and Presidential Election](/article/business/3005740-irans-fuel-price-debate-economy-protests-and-presidential-election) [Dollar Slips Amid Slowing U.S. Economy and Global Political Uncertainties](/article/business/3005760-dollar-slips-amid-slowing-us-economy-and-global-political-uncertainties) [Sunak vs Starmer: Polling across UK opens for general elections; Issues like economy, tax immigration in focus for voters](/article/international/3005783-sunak-vs-starmer-polling-across-uk-opens-for-general-elections-issues-like-economy-tax-immigration-in-focus-for-voters) [Shane Jones to Strengthen Mining Sector Ties on Australian Visit](/article/law-order/3005881-shane-jones-to-strengthen-mining-sector-ties-on-australian-visit)",

    "text": "From swimming to skiing, people of all ages enjoy the snowstorm in Burlington After weeks without snow, storm brings joy to many in our region. After weeks without snow, storm brings joy to many in our region. After weeks without snow, storm brings joy to many in our region. Whether you like to spend the day on the couch or out on the mountain, many in our region have been waiting a long time for a good snowstorm. Sunday's storm didn't slow down the fun for anyone at Oakledge Park in Burlington. A group of friends kept up their weekly get-together, taking a dip in Lake Champlain. Jesse Ritvo said the snow is \"perfect\" for the lake. They said there are a lot of benefits for your body by exposing it to the cold for a couple of minutes each week. \"As soon as as soon as we're in, we're going to have more dopamine and norepinephrine lasting for 4 to 6 hours,\" said Ritvo. \"So with the dopamine, things that are pleasurable are going to be more so. And, with the combination of dopamine and norepinephrine, we're going to have better focus.\" However, Ritvo, first responders, and other health experts agree that you should always be careful when swimming in cold water. \"I feel amazing but check with your physician or your PCP before you do this,\" said Ritvo. Back on land, the park looked a lot more like what can typically come to mind when you think of a 'snowstorm'. People of all ages got outside for some snowy fun in what some call the best kind of snow. \"It's part powder, part sticky,\" said 5th grade student Bellamy Hill. \"It's like fluffy; if you squish it, it'll stick.\" From cross-country skiing to walking the dog, the latest big storm of the season finally brought winter back to the Green Mountain State. \"We were really sad when on Christmas and on Hannukah that there wasn't any snow and on winter break there wasn't snow,\" said Colby Hill, Bellamy's brother. \"Then a couple days after, there was still no snow -- and now we have this and we're happy.\" The Hills said they're hoping the snow will stick around long enough to cause a school delay in the morning.",
