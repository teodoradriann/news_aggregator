The highlights this week: The leadership in North Korea and Myanmar rankles Chinese officials, Kazakhstan declines to join BRICS and sends a signal to Russia and China, and a Chinese bot network targets down-ballot races in the U.S. election. Welcome to Foreign Policy’s China Brief. The highlights this week: The leadership in North Korea and Myanmar rankles Chinese officials, Kazakhstan declines to join BRICS and sends a signal to Russia and China, and a Chinese bot network targets down-ballot races in the U.S. election. China’s Troublesome Neighbors This week, China and India [announced a deal](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/23/india-china-border-agreement-ladakh-trade/) to reduce tensions and resume mutual patrols along their disputed border in Ladakh—so far with few details. This is welcome news in Beijing, but lately, its most troublesome neighbors have been its supposed friends: North Korea and Myanmar are both causing head-scratching and even anger among Chinese officials. China has not offered formal comment on the recent reports suggesting that North Korean troops are headed to Ukraine to fight on Russia’s behalf, but it is [causing real concern](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/asia/north-korea-ukraine-russia-china.html) in Beijing. China has sought to simultaneously offer rhetorical—and to a degree, material—support to Russia while not wrecking its ties with the West. North Korea’s actions certainly cross that line. North Korea is China’s [only treaty ally](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/why-china-north-korea-decided-renew-60-year-old-treaty), with a mutual defense agreement that dates to 1961; it is also nominally an ideological partner. But [tensions](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/09/north-korea-and-china-arent-the-allies-you-think-they.html) have long marked the Beijing-Pyongyang relationship. North Koreans resent China positioning itself as a communist big brother to the smaller nation—in much the same way that the Chinese came to resent the Soviet Union. Behind closed doors, North Korean leaders sometimes [trot out](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/north-korea-stokes-anti-china-sentiment-in-response-to-tougher-sanctions-01042018161757.html) the line that Japan is a “century-old enemy,” while China is a “thousand-year-old enemy,” referring to China’s [historical imperialism](https://www.hnn.us/article/the-korea-china-textbook-war--whats-it-all-about) in the Korean Peninsula. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has [reportedly used](https://www.koreadailyus.com/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-labels-china-a-longstanding-enemy-amid-rising-tensions/) a similar phrase himself. In China, North Korea has become a byword for totalitarian repression—so much so that some young Chinese use the term “[West Korea](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/West_Korea)” to criticize the political leadership’s swing toward greater authoritarianism. Chinese analysts and officials often [privately criticize](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137455666_1) North Korea’s failure to follow China’s 1980s path of “reform and opening,” depicting Pyongyang as intransigent and paranoid. The Ukraine news also comes as Chinese experts [express worry](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3282924/china-tight-spot-korean-peninsula-hostilities-test-strategic-patience) about growing aggression from North Korea against South Korea. Part of that concern is that Pyongyang can now use Moscow’s need for allies to [play the Kremlin](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/07/northkorea-war-nuclear-russia-china/) against Beijing—reducing China’s already limited leverage over North Korea. Meanwhile, a bombing attack in Myanmar last week targeting the Chinese consulate in Mandalay—which damaged the building but caused no fatalities—still doesn’t have a [clear culprit](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/myanmar-china-watch/who-bombed-the-chinese-consulate-in-myanmars-mandalay.html). China has called for an investigation and lodged “[serious representations](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-condemns-attack-myanmar-consulate-2024-10-21/)” with Myanmar’s ruling military junta, which took power in a 2021 coup. The attack will stir further concerns in Beijing that the military leadership is unreliable—and possibly losing the country’s civil war. China has close ties to Myanmar’s generals, [greased](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/01/09/myanmar-china-border-offensive-cyberscams-three-brotherhood-alliance/) by [mutual corruption](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3241914/myanmars-corruption-crackdown-against-two-scapegoat-generals-shows-cracks-within-military-junta) among both militaries. Beijing initially hoped that the coup would allow Chinese-funded [megaprojects](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/201901/1137565.shtml) in Myanmar to move forward. But it turns out that war is bad for infrastructure, and there has been [little progress](https://www.stimson.org/2024/china-in-myanmar-how-the-game-changing-neighbor-would-continue-to-maintain-its-influence/) on any of the Chinese investments. China is also irate about the military regime’s [failure to protect](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/china-faces-backlash-demanding-tougher-action-myanmars-protesters.html) Chinese property and citizens—and especially about criminal groups kidnapping Chinese workers for [cyber scams](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/north-east-asia/china-myanmar/b179-scam-centres-and-ceasefires-china-myanmar-ties-coup). As a result, Beijing is building greater ties with ethnic militias and other anti-government armed forces in Myanmar, building on existing agreements (and private deals) between the Chinese People’s Liberation Army and these [militias](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/backgrounder-ethnic-armies-in-the-myanmar-civil-war/). China’s biggest concern is along its border with Myanmar, where it has tried [unsuccessfully but sincerely](https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/08/myanmars-junta-loses-control-north-chinas-influence-grows) to broker a peace that would both prevent violence from spilling over and allow for trade to reopen. Rebel forces in Myanmar have made considerable gains along the frontier, including seizing a [border post](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/kachin-border-post-captured-10222024050706.html) this week. As with North Korea, China’s preference in Myanmar would be for all involved to stop yelling and at least pretend to get along. But that is not happening, Beijing is discovering that even superpowers can’t just make things go the way that they want on the ground. What We’re Following Kazakhstan’s balancing act. Kazakhstan has said it will not join BRICS this year and [paused](https://jamestown.org/program/kazakhstan-pauses-prospective-application-to-brics/) its membership application—though it maintains observer status at the group, which held a leaders’ summit in Kazan, Russia, this week. Under pressure from a public that distrusts both Russia and China, Kazakh leaders are trying to make sure the door to the West stays open too. This signal is mostly aimed at Russia, with which Kazakhstan has been [on the outs](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/09/16/kazakhstan-russia-ukraine-war/) since the invasion of Ukraine, but it affects Astana’s relationship with Beijing as well. Kazakhstan has extensive [economic ties](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/business/kazakhstan-china-electric-vehicles.html) with China: Their trade jumped to more than $31 billion last year, though part of that likely comes from sanctions avoidance for funds ultimately bound for Russia. However, some ethnic Kazakhs have been swept up in China’s concentration camps in Xinjiang, and despite Astana’s [efforts to cover this up](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09668136.2024.2336511), it has affected the Kazakh public’s perception of Beijing. China’s Belt and Road Initiative [remains unpopular](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/18681026231211354?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.4) [despite](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2019/02/kazakhs-wary-of-chinese-embrace-as-bri-gathers-steam?lang=en) billions of dollars flowing into Kazakhstan; the signature border city of Khorgos, set up as a trade zone, is a [backwater](https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-east-border-china-trade-photo-easy-economics/32925406.html). Child trafficking trial. Yu Huaying, a woman who in the past year has become the face of China’s long-running [child-trafficking](https://www.scmp.com/economy/article/3172967/child-abandonment-trafficking-reach-tipping-point-china) crisis, is [back on trial](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/12/WS6709ba58a310f1265a1c727c.html) for six additional offenses after she was sentenced to death last year for kidnapping and trafficking 11 children in the 1990s. Yu mostly targeted the children of migrant workers, who often work multiple jobs with long hours that make watching children difficult. Execution is [uncommon](https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article-abstract/53/3/500/542242?login=false) in China, even after a “death sentence,” which usually results in long jail terms instead. But Yu’s case has struck a chord with the public, and online commentators have overwhelmingly called for her to be executed. In 2016, the Ministry of Public Security launched a [popular program](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/chinese-parents-reunited-abducted-son-14-year-search-inspired-hit-movi-rcna8385) that attempted to locate kidnapped children, making up in some part for past neglect of the crisis. More than 8,000 children, now mostly teenagers or young adults, have been [reunited](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57815491) with their parents. Tech and Business U.S. election influence ops. The infamous Chinese bot network known as Spamouflage is largely [targeting](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/x-bots-china-republicans.html?partner=slack&smid=sl-share) down-ballot races in this year’s U.S. elections—with an eye on politicians known for strong positions on human rights in China, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, or those who have targeted Chinese tech. Spamouflage has been [running](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/MTAC-East-Asia-Report.pdf) since 2017 and is mostly used for the harassment of Chinese dissidents. Like many tech-centered influence operations, Spamouflage’s operations often appear ineffective; few posts go viral, and they are largely reproduced by other bots in the same network. Still, the targeting can be indicative: In this case, it shows that China may be more interested in harming individual politicians and [securing local power](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/beijing-chinatown-influence-campaign-3f7914f0?mod=china_news_article_pos3) than in who wins the U.S. presidency. New restrictions on Chinese AI. Washington’s flurry of rulemaking targeted at Chinese technology continues—and will likely go on regardless of the outcome of the Nov. 5 election, as it remains one of few issues with genuine bipartisan consensus. The latest round of restrictions is [aimed largely](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-soon-curb-ai-investment-china-2024-10-21/) at artificial intelligence, curtailing U.S. investments in China. The U.S. Justice Department has also proposed new rules to redefine [data protection](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-unveils-new-rules-block-china-russia-iran-accessing-bulk-us-data-2024-10-21/) for U.S. citizens against Chinese firms—which is a tricky issue given how little user data is protected by U.S. firms.

Hamas Is Very Much Alive.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/18/sinwar-dead-hamas-gaza-israel-history-resistance/)by Steven A. Cook A Bit of Culture Another spooky excerpt this Halloween season comes from the 4th-century collection of tales [Soushen Ji](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/g#a2398) (“In Search of the Supernatural”). At the time, belief in ghosts was widespread in China, but as the tale shows, it was not universal.—Brendan O’Kane, translator Ruan Zhan, whose byname was Qianli, was a long-standing opponent of the existence of ghosts. There was no augment for which he did not have a counterargument, and at each triumph he proclaimed that life and death had been fully explained by Reason. One day, a visitor came, gave his name, and engaged Zhan in debate. After some initial pleasantries, the discussion turned to matters of metaphysics. The visitor proved to be an able debater: He and Zhan went back and forth for quite some time, until the conversation turned to ghosts and spirits. At this, the back and forth turned heated. Finally, the visitor broke off and with a strange expression asked, “The sages and worthies of the ages have all taught of the existence of ghosts and spirits, sir. How is it that you alone deny their existence? Well, your servant here happens to be a ghost.” He transformed into a bizarre form, then vanished in the blink of an eye. Zhan fell silent, a terrible look on his face. He died of illness a little more than a year later. James Palmer is a deputy editor at Foreign Policy.

    "title": "From ‘Dear John’ to unity",
    "text": "After the dear John letter that never was, six Democratic Alliance (DA) members have taken up their positions in President Cyril Ramaphosa ’s Cabinet alongside their counterparts from the African National Congress (ANC) and several of the nine other political parties constituting the new government of national unity, which is set to steer the South African State over the next five years.\nIf you have just landed from Mars, Ramaphosa sent a scathing letter to DA leader John Steenhuisen , admonishing him for what he saw as his party’s shifting of goalposts in negotiations for the new government. The salutation was “Dear John” – not “Dear Honourable Steenhuisen”, which some felt would have been more fitting for an elected MP.\nAfter Ramaphosa’s zinger of rebuke, it seemed he was ready to roll without the DA, especially since the ANC and the other parties it had been negotiating with – minus the DA – had more than 50% of the seats in the National Assembly. That’s why the jesters among us had a field day with the President’s “Dear John” greeting, hinting it was game over for negotiations with the DA.\nNow, if you are wondering where this whole “Dear John” thing came from, buckle up for a bit of linguistic history. During World War II, soldiers on the battlefront would eagerly await mail from their sweethearts back home. Sometimes, instead of lovey-dovey letters, they would get a “Dear John” note. Something like: “Hey soldier, while you were out there fighting the good fight, I found someone else.”\nBut why the name John? It’s believed to have emerged from the commonness of the name among American soldiers at the time of that big war, which led to it being the generic placeholder for a boyfriend or husband. Initially, “Dear John” signified an unfortunate soldier receiving a letter from a wife or girlfriend announcing the termination of their relationship. Over time, “Dear John” has entered broader usage to describe any letter or message informing someone of the end of a relationship, especially a romantic one.\nSo, when Ramaphosa dropped that “Dear John” on Steenhuisen, it was like a modern- day political twist on a classic breakup trope.\nBut all that’s water under the bridge. Ramaphosa and Steenhuisen, along with the leaders of the other political parties in the new government, now stand united, ready to lead South Africa out of its current challenges: poverty, unemployment, inequality, lopadshedding, crime . . . you name it.\nAs his Agriculture Minister, Ramaphosa will have to correspond with Steenhuisen from time to time. Will he continue to address him as “Dear John”? Or will he opt for “Comrade John”, a term the ANC seems to reserve for its allies? Just look at Jacob Zuma ’s journey. When he was in their inner circle, he was Comrade Jacob Zuma. But after parting ways to form the uMkhonto we Sizwe party, that special title slipped away.\nIt’s a mystery to me why ANC members still stick with ‘Comrade’ – 35 years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. I have been to Russian twice – spending a week on each visit – and not once did I hear anyone being called Comrade.\nA cartoonist from one of South Africa’s top newspapers captured the absurdity of it all when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited South Africa in 2006. In the cartoon, Putin and former President Thabo Mbeki are cruising in an open-top vehicle in the Kruger National Park, passing a herd of rhinos. The animals are all emblazoned with the label ‘SACP’ on their sides. Turning to Mbeki, Putin quips: “I thought those were extinct!”\nSpeaking of comrades, maybe it’s Zuma and his uMkhonto we Sizwe crew, as well as those of their ilk in the other leftist parties, that the ANC should be tagging with ‘Comrade’. They are the ones gunning for a radical agenda: land expropriation without compensation, nationalisation of mines and banks, and all that jazz.\nOn the other hand, despite the socialist chatter on its website and in its literature, the ANC has pursued business-friendly policies. It’s much like dancing with capitalists and comrades at the same party.\nEdited by Martin Zhuwakinyu\nCreamer Media Senior Deputy Editor",

Max Verstappen (Red Bull)2. Sergio Perez (Red Bull)3. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari)4. Oscar Piastri (McLaren)5. Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin)6. George Russell (Mercedes)7. Oliver Bearman (Ferrari)8. Lando Norris (McLaren)9. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)10. Nico Hülkenberg (Haas)\n19:36\nVerstappen: “We managed the gap throughout”\nMax Verstappen, speaking to Canal+: “It’s a wonderful weekend for me and for the whole team. The second stint was quite long but we had to make do. The last laps were complicated to manage with the latecomers and the cold tires, but we managed the gap throughout. »\n19:33\nLeclerc: “Bearman can be proud”\nCharles Leclerc, 3rd: “It’s one of the most physical circuits of the championships, it’s really hot, it makes things difficult. Oliver (Bearman, his teammate of the day) did a very good job and deserves to be named driver of the day. He can be very proud. It’s only a matter of time before he gets to Formula 1.”\n19:25\nLap record for Leclerc\nThe Monegasque improved in the last lap and will finish with an additional point.\n19:25\nVICTORY FOR VERSTAPPEN!\nLeading almost from start to finish of this Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, the Dutchman achieved an easy success. He finished ahead of his teammate Sergio Perez, like last week, and Charles Leclerc.\n19:25\nVerstappen attempts the best lap\nEven though he is still on worn tires, the Dutchman tries everything on the last lap to grab an additional point.\n19:23\nBearman had\nThe Ferrari debutant didn’t break down and was still 5 seconds ahead with two laps remaining. He should finish his first GP in a nice 5th place.\n19:20\nThe frozen podium\nAt the end of a rather boring Grand Prix, Red Bull should win another double. There are three rounds left.\n19:17\nBearman must not make mistakes\nIn seventh position, the beginner saw Lando Norris rushing towards him, but his racing pace was impressive.\n19:13\nCatastrophic stoppage for Zhou\nThe Chinese leaves his place in the top 10 to Hülkenberg.\n19:11\nHamilton best lap\nThe Briton is launched, by his own admission, “in qualifying mode”. He has just stolen the best lap from Verstappen and will try to get back on the cars with damaged tires.\n19:10\nThe ranking after 40 laps\n1. Verstappen2. Perez +8.83. Leclerc +12.04. Piastri +11.95. Alonso +3.86. Russell +1.47. Bearman +5.78. Norris +5.09. Hamilton + 1.210. Zhou +21.7\n19:08\nBearman will have to defend\nNice baptism of fire for the Ferrari replacement, who will have to protect his seventh place in front of Norris and Hamilton, hot on his heels, with new tires.\n19:06\nNorris in the pits\nThe Briton, who was in 4th position, wears soft tires. He comes out 8th, just ahead of Hamilton.\n19:05\nNo suspense at the head of the race\nBarring an accident or a safety car, we don’t see how Red Bull couldn’t do a double. Perez is 12 seconds ahead of Leclerc.\n19:04\nHamilton returns to the pits!\nAfter 37 laps with the same tires, the Briton dived into the pits and came out in 9th position.\n19:01\nPiastri misses his overtake\nThe McLaren driver finally had a window to pass Hamilton, but went too far to the outside and blocked the wheels… He remains 6th.\n18:59\nBattles especially at the back of the peloton\nThe fight is fierce for 13th place between Ocon, Albon, Tsunoda and Sargeant, currently in that order.\n18:57\nNorris wants to hold on “as late as possible”\nThe McLaren driver has still not pitted and has just told his radio that he wants to continue on track as much as possible. Behind him, Lewis Hamilton didn’t stop either.\n18:54\nThe ranking after 30 rounds\n1. Max Verstappen 2. Sergio Perez +7.43. Charles Leclerc +9.34. Lando Norris +2.95. Lewis Hamilton +4.46. Oscar Piastri +0.87. Fernando Alsono +4.08. George Russell +1.69. Oscar Bearman +5,710. Nico Hülkenberg +8.8\n18:52\nOcon currently 14th\nThe only Frenchman still in the race, the Alpine driver clings to 14th place, under pressure from Williams. Considering the level of his car, it’s a pretty good result.\n18:49\nLeclerc takes the podium\nIt took him a while, but Leclerc finally managed to pass Norris, who still hasn’t pitted, and moved up to third place. The Briton did not try to resist, but had a nice Grand Prix.\n18:44\nPiastri and Hamilton still in the fight\nIt’s the soap opera of this Grand Prix for the moment: the McLaren driver is trying somehow to catch up with his elder brother, who is currently impeccable, as we reach the halfway point of the race.\n18:42\nNorris clings to the podium\nThe Briton has still not returned to the pits, but is still in third position. Behind, Leclerc is nibbling away by hundredths.\n18:40\nVerstappen flew away\nUnless there is a race, it will be difficult to see the Dutchman again, who is more than six seconds ahead at the head of the circuit.\n18:38\nThe ranking after 20 rounds\n1. Max Verstappen2. Sergio Perez +6.23. Lando Norris +3.24. Charles Leclerc +1.35. Lewis Hamilton +3.06. Oscar Piastri +0.57. Fernando Alonso +3.58. George Russell +1.39. Nico Hülkenberg +0.710. Oliver Bearman +5.6\n18:36\nPerez passed\nThe Mexican is again in second position. His newer tires made the difference against Norris.\n18:34\nBrawl between Hamilton and Piastri\nThe Mercedes and the McLaren are engaged in a tough battle for 5th place and are not doing each other any favors. For now, Hamilton is holding his own.\n18:31\nNorris under threat from Perez\nThe second RedBull driver is closing in on second place.\n18:30\nBearman in the top 10, Russell 8th\nSome movements in the top 10: the young Ferrari driver gained two positions to regain his place in the points. Russell has just overtaken Hülkenberg for 8th place.\n18:27\nVerstappen deadlock and tete\nNorris finally broke down and didn’t insist. The Dutchman, with his hard tires and DRS, is on a completely different pace.\n18:24\nPerez and Alonso under investigation\nThe stewards are interested in what happened in the pit lane during the safety car.\n18:22\nThe safety car returns to the pits\nThe cars are launched again and for the moment, Norris remains in the lead, despite Verstappen’s offensives.\n18:22\nThe ranking after 10 rounds\n1. Lando Norris (McLaren)2. Max Verstappen (Red Bull)3. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)4. Sergio Perez (Red Bull)5. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari)6. Oscar Piastri (McLaren)7. Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin)8. Nico Hulkenberg (Haas)9. George Russell (Mercedes)10. Guanyu Zhou (Kick Sauber)\n18:20\nNorris in the lead\nThe McLaren driver is one of the only ones not to have returned to the pits and is therefore leading the race. His tires are worn so he will have to hope for racing success to hold on.\n18:16\nEveryone goes back to the stands\nThe single-seaters take advantage of this safety car to pass through the pit lane. There could be penalties, the situation is quite chaotic.\n18:14\nGrosse sortie pour Stroll, safety car !\nThe Canadian shot straight in the last sector, on a big mistake. He has nothing, but his Grand Prix is ​​over. The safety car will enter the track on the seventh lap.\n18:13\nGasly: ​​“Sad for the team”\nPierre Gasly at the microphone of Canal +: “Things are not good for us this weekend, we found damage to the car yesterday which cost us Q2 and today I was not able to race. I’m sad for the team, who are doing everything to move forward. »\n18:11\nBest lap for Verstappen\nThe Dutchman strings together the best laps at the head of the race and is now 2.5 seconds ahead.\n18:09\nPerez takes second position!\nGreat move from Sergio Perez, who passed inside on Leclerc. The Red Bull really seems above the rest. That suits Verstappen, who flies away.\n18:08\nA second ahead for Verstappen\nThe Dutchman is trying to get out of the DRS zone, even if Leclerc is holding on well for the moment.\n18:06\nBearman in the heat of the moment\nThe young Ferrari driver, replacing Carlos Sainz, had the opportunity to take his first laps and attacked Tsunoda.\n18:05\nGasly already called to the pits\nThe Frenchman has a problem with his gearbox and will have to retire on the first lap.\n18:05\nLeclerc attacked by Perez\nBig battle for second place, but the Monegasque held on against the Mexican.\n18:04\nLet’s go !\n6:04 p.m., big start for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, the lights are out!\n18:00\nIt won’t be long…\nThe drivers are in their single-seaters and begin their formation lap.\n17:49\nWhitaker: “No race won for Verstappen”\nMartin Whitaker, GP boss, to Le Parisien: “The three previous editions produced three different winners. It’s not at all a race won for Verstappen. We must not forget that it is a city race. The safety car intervened on each edition. This can restart everything. »\n17:46\nAlpine already in the tough\nEsteban Ocon in 17th position on the grid, just ahead of Pierre Gasly: ​​the Alpine team is in immense difficulty at the start of the year and is preparing for a difficult season.\nDismissed engineers, overweight single-seaters… We explain the reasons for this slump in this article.\n#Saudi #Arabian #relive #race #won #Max #Verstappen",

    "text": "play videoplay video Video duration: 21 minutes 13 seconds 21:13 The military and strategic expert, Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi, said that the statements of the head of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Ismail Haniyeh, about adhering to the demands of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, are based on field facts that support them. During his analysis for Al Jazeera, Al-Duwairi asked, “If the situation of the resistance in Gaza is tenuous, will the Hamas Political Bureau adhere to its demands for the necessity of stopping the war once and for all and the return of the displaced?” Haniyeh had said - during a speech in which he touched on the details of the ceasefire negotiations - that, “If we receive a clear position to stop the aggression and return the displaced, we will show flexibility regarding the issue of prisoners,” stressing the movement’s commitment to a comprehensive agreement in 3 stages linked to international guarantees. Al-Duwairi explained, \"Few would have thought that the Al-Qassam Brigades - the military wing of the Hamas movement - and the resistance in Gaza would enter the sixth month of this intensity of fighting, confrontation, and steadfastness against the occupation army.\" The military expert's comments also came in the context of his analysis of the statements of the Chairman of the US Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, who said that no one imagined that Israel would eliminate only 35% of Hamas fighters, and a third of its tunnel network, stressing that what happened to the Israeli army with the tunnels was a lesson. It should be learned. Sniper scene Regarding Al-Qassam gifting the scene of a sniper attack by one of the occupation soldiers in the Tal Al-Hawa neighborhood in Gaza to Ansar Allah the Houthis, Al-Duwairi said that the group (the Houthis) was actually able to confuse international navigation and trade and provided a lot during the war. Dedicating the sniping scene to the group's leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, was considered an appreciation for the role of the Houthis during the Israeli war on Gaza, just as the Lebanese Hezbollah escalates according to a disciplined approach, alongside the \"Islamic resistance in Iraq.\" A few days ago, a leader in the Al-Qassam Brigades said that the Ansar Allah group informed them that its recent escalation in the Red Sea was due to the Israeli occupation’s intention to attack Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip, and the continuation of the starvation policy. The Qassam leader stated to Al Jazeera that the Ansar Allah group sent a letter to Al-Qassam asking for its opinion regarding mediations to release the crew of a ship they are holding, and that the group confirmed that any decision regarding the ship and their crew is “exclusively with Al-Qassam.” Source: Al Jazeera",

    "text": "Lyon, en medio de la crisis: puso en venta a todo el plantel, incluido Tagliafico En Francia aseguran que el equipo, propiedad del empresario John Textor, debe recaudar 100 millones de euros antes del cierre del mercado de pases y les avisó a los jugadores que podrían ser transferidos. El gol de Tagliafico en el triunfo agónico de Lyon ante Brest Nicolás Tagliafico fue recibido como un verdadero campeón en Francia después de dar otra vuelta olímpica con la Selección Argentina en la Copa América. Hubo aplausos y reconocimientos, aunque no tardaron en llegar las malas noticias. La prensa local asegura que Olympique Lyon atraviesa una profunda crisis económica y piensa tomar una drástica decisión para recaudar dinero. El propietario John Textor, quien también maneja los hilos de Botafogo y Crystal Palace con la empresa 777 Partners, le había prometido al organismo financiero DNCG saldar varias y jugosas deudas. Pero lo cierto es que se fueron acumulando y el monto, según el diario L’Equipe, ascendió a 100 millones de euros, que debe ser pagado antes de que termine el mercado de pases en Europa a finales de agosto. Si bien el empresario norteamericano tiene en sus arcas el dinero suficiente para sanear la economía de OL, por el momento los números siguen en rojo y los directivos pusieron en venta a todo el plantel profesional. Desde los juveniles hasta los más experimentados. En el medio de los rumores sobre una posible quiebra y alejamientos masivos por el Fair Play financiero, aparece el lateral izquierdo argentino. Él reconoció que no tiene intenciones de marcharse esta temporada y piensa cumplir el año que le queda de contrato, salvo que le presenten una oferta superadora para jugar en otro equipo del Viejo Continente. A ocho días de que se cierre la ventana de transferencias, en la que invirtió 134,2 millones de euros en fichajes, Lyon apenas pudo juntar 25 millones de euros por las salidas de Jake O'Brien a Everton y de Skelly Alvero a Werder Bremen. Habrá que ver qué otros futbolistas pueden seguir el mismo camino. No te pierdas nada",

    "title": "Trump tells religious broadcasters he’ll defend Christianity against perceived threats from the left - The Columbian",
    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Former President Donald Trump promised to use a second term in the White House to defend Christian values and even suggested he’d shield the faith’s central iconography, warning a convention of religious broadcasters on Thursday night that the left wants “to tear down crosses.” “Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stamp out the churches, just like every fascist regime has tried to co-opt them and control them,” Trump told hundreds of cheering attendees at the National Religious Broadcasters International Christian Media Convention in Nashville. “And, in America, the radical left is trying to do both.” “They want to tear down crosses where they can, and cover them up with social justice flags,” Trump added. “But no one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you.” Trump’s comments reflect his embrace of Christian nationalism, a belief that is powerful among conservative evangelicals who say the founders of the U.S. intended the country to be a Christian nation. Some adherents believe the U.S. Constitution was inspired by God and that the federal government should declare the U.S. a Christian nation, advocate Christian values or stop enforcing the separation of church and state. Trump is favored in a Republican primary where the once crowded field has dwindled to just him and his former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. The Christian media gathering, where sponsors distributed free red and white baseball caps emblazoned with “Make America Pray Again,” was exceedingly friendly territory for the former president, whose address often felt more like a rally than a staid convention speech. “The left is trying to shame Christians,” Trump said. “They’re trying to shame us. I’m a very proud Christian.” Trump brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly and frequently championed his record on abortion, including appointing three conservative Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the Roe v. Wade decision. But he notably didn’t mention the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that has prompted providers there to pause in vitro fertilization after justices ruled that frozen embryos could be considered children under state law. President Joe Biden ‘s reelection campaign released a blank statement on the matter late Thursday, ironically calling attention to Trump’s lack of reaction on the “Alabama IVF ruling he is responsible for.” Instead, Trump used his speech to boast that he had used his first term to do “more to uphold religious freedom than any administration in history.” “The enthusiasm for this election coming up in November is far greater than it was in 2016 or 2020,” he said. “Far greater, it’s not even a contest.” Tennessee holds its primary on Super Tuesday, March 5, when many states around the country vote and could move Trump to the cusp of claiming the Republican nomination. Some religious leaders were initially hesitant to get behind multi-divorcee Trump when he first ran for president in 2016, but now they are among his mostly solidly loyal “Make America Great Again” base. That’s despite a personal history that has only gotten more checkered in recent years, including Trump being indicted in New York in connection with hush money payments made to a porn actress in an attempt to suppress an extramarital affair. “When he came onto the scene, people were skeptical,” said Troy Miller, president and CEO of the National Religious Broadcasters. “But I think, as they’ve learned more and listened to Donald Trump speak, the one thing I hear all the time from people … is that they really feel like Donald Trump understands them and that’s the biggest connection that people make is, ‘This is a guy in politics who gets us, who understands us, who doesn’t talk like he’s an elitist and talk down to us.’”",
