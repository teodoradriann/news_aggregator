    "title": "Cybersecurity Considerations: Strategies after the 2024 CrowdStrike Outage",
    "text": "The year 2024 was shaken when CrowdStrike, an Endpoint protection service, went down for hours due to a cyberattack. Such incidents show how being dependent on the security model cloud cyberinfrastructure is a threat to security, as it creates vulnerabilities in the system and exposes organizations to cyberattacks. Niranjan Reddy Kotha delves deeper into the problems here in [Analysis of 2024 CrowdStrike Outage](https://www.ijraset.com/best-journal/analyzing-the-2024-crowdstrike-outage-implications-for-saas-dependent-cybersecurity-architectures). Moreover, he also gives insights on how organizations can adapt their cybersecurity practices, given that the world is moving towards cloud dependency.\nUnderstanding the CrowdStrike Outage\nRelying solely on cloud infrastructure to fight threats proved flawed in 2024 when CrowdStrike went offline. The CrowdStrike outage lasted over a few hours, leaving every organization that used its services vulnerable as it had no security systems to detect or counter the attack. Such an outage extensively highlighted and exposed what was already prevalent: being overly reliant on SaaS providers.\nCrowdStrike did apologize and tried to relieve the damage through transparent communication, but damage control should not have been needed in the first place. Such dependence on providers proves to weaken the company in every regard, as this situation highlights fundamental issues in the security of the framework in the first place. Niranjan Reddy Kotha stresses how incidents like these pose bigger questions and require a comprehensive analysis of how cybersecurity strategies could be enhanced.\nCrowdStrike Outage Contributions\n- Disruption to Services & Non-usage of Services – Non-availability of Endpoint services – Highly Critical\n- Delay in Service Responsiveness – Delay of Event Detection and New Security Threat Level Response – Highly Critical\n- Monetary Devastation – Money Loss Expected to be Incurred by Affected Businesses – Mild\n- Negative Portrayal – Crowd Strike Brand Reputation & Trust With Clients: Highly Critical\n- Transition to Hybrid Solutions – Hybrid And On-Premises Solutions Developments – Highly Critical\nCrowdStrike's key Principles:\nThe Crowdstrike incident was another issue that hoped organizations would readjust their cyber strategies. Niranjan Reddy Kotha notes that even though these cloud-based solutions provide excellent elasticity and scalability, they also disadvantage enterprises when such cloud systems experience an outage. The incident has made most of the firms sider moving the borders and using the hybrid models of security cyber systems that offer the best of both worlds in terms of being service base and infrastructure based\nDoes CrowdStrike Solve Hybrid Cyber Security Matters\nThe advancement of hybrid cybersecurity models is a significant growth area as enterprises search for better solutions for resilience. With a combination of On-Premise as well as Cloud Based Solutions, Firms Can:\n- Maintain their services in case of an outage.\n- Protect critical business processes by using on-premise systems.\n- Use layered defenses to improve their level of security.\nNiranjan Reddy Kotha claims that businesses can maintain high levels of security during cloud service disconnections by integrating a hybrid approach, which acts as insurance for cloud-based systems.\nAnalysis of CrowdStrike cyber RTC technology Outage\nThus, Niranjan Reddy Kotha stresses in the Analysis of 2024 Crowdstrike Outage that the CrowdStrike outage is evaluated in this case using a mixed-methods research design and investigation that considers both the qualitative and quantitative nature of the event's consequences.\nQualitative Research\nInterviews with cloud security providers exposed significant shortcomings in models reliant on cloud technologies. Experts discussed the issues organizations encountered regarding the slow detection of threats and the slow recovery from the disruption. They emphasized that disaster recovery and hybrid solutions will be significant for organizations in the future.\nQuantitative Research\nIn quantitative terms, all data related to the extent of the service blackout was captured, including:\n- The total downtime of the service\n- Money-losing estimation by the companies affected by it.\n- The delay in response and detection of the incident\nThe evidence indicated that the affected organizations had glaring weaknesses, which would have made it possible to target them and make recommendations on how to improve their security frameworks in the future.\nIn Real Terms for Companies\nSome of the best lessons from the CrowdStrike failure are directly relevant to the strategies adopted by inter-organizational firms. According to Niranjan Reddy Kotha, firms that provide cloud services and cater directly to their customers must be mindful of the risks posed by single-hinged models.\n- Re examination of Cloud Adoption: Organisations must examine their reliance on cloud security solutions and try to diversify their security framework.\n- Use of Mixed Models: Moderate use of cloud and premise-based solutions will enhance service reliability in the event of failure.\n- Reinforcement of Incident Response Adequate Plans: Organisations need to improve their downtime response to incidents and backup strategies in case of an attack or a service outage.\nThe Future of CyberSecurity\nAccording to Niranjan Reddy Kotha, cyber security authorities speak regarding the rules that help in preventing similar occurrences in the future:\nBackup and Suspension Systems: Normal operations should store all the crucial information and services in various sites to avert a business failure due to a disruption.\nVulnerability Management: Early intervention has a significant advantage in allowing us to detect and resolve issues before they become substantial, and outages are often limited.\nModels of security systems: The best model is the formulation of concepts combining SaaS and on-premise solutions to improve security and business continuity effectiveness.\nFinal Thoughts: Cybersecurity Options on the Table\nThe Crowdstrike service interruption of 2024 highlights how all these industries are vulnerable when relying on SaaS platforms for their cybersecurity needs. You can view the full Journal Crowdstrike Outage Implications for Saas Development. In this day and age, when cloud services continue to be at the core of any business, it is imperative that firms change their approaches to data protection to introduce effectiveness into operations and, thus, reduce the risk associated with service interruptions. Combining cloud and on-premise solutions guarantees the businesses' protection monitoring and alerts as long as the systems run, boosting security.\nWhat occurred may only serve as a cautionary tale for the continuing transition to and further development of comprehensive and secure cloud-centric infrastructures and solutions. Those who wish to cultivate a broad understanding of the changing landscape will become well acquainted with recent developments because this entry is merely a fraction of the growing cybersecurity puzzle. This is a part of the larger picture for those eager to delve deep into the shifting paradigm.",

    "title": "Why fall is the season of hair loss and how to manage it",
    "text": "Fall is often referred to as the season of reading, but it's also known as the season of hair loss. Why is fall the season of hair loss? Human hair grows in the spring and thins in the fall. According to Professor Kwon Ohsang of the Department of Dermatology at Seoul National University Hospital on Friday, normal hair goes through a growth phase (three to five years), a regression phase (one month), and a resting phase (three months). However, in patients with hair loss, the growth phase becomes shorter and shorter, making it difficult for hair to grow long and thick. The growth cycle also explains why humans experience seasonal molting. While animals grow the most hair in winter to counteract the cold, human hair grows more in spring and less in fall because it protects against intense UV rays. Hair loss is the absence of hair in areas where hair should generally be present. It can include thinning or loss of hair in certain areas. There are two main types of hair loss: those where the hair follicles are retained (hereditary, resting, and circular alopecia) and those where they are not (scarring alopecia). Hereditary (androgenetic) alopecia accounts for 85-90 percent of all hair loss. There are three leading causes: genetics, aging, and male hormones (dihydrotestosterone, DHT), and the number of people with hereditary alopecia is increasing as the population ages. Environmental factors, such as Westernized eating habits, excessive dieting, and smoking, play a role, and obesity is also associated with hair loss, as inflammatory substances secreted by the fat layer can worsen hair loss. In addition, there’s also the condition known as telogen effluvium, which is a temporary change in the hair growth cycle due to stress and nutritional deficiencies. It’s prevalent after childbirth, as the female hormones that increase during pregnancy decrease after delivery. Women who have given birth usually lose the most hair around the 100th day of their child's life, and it usually recovers by the time the child turns 12 months old. Some women who don't recover may have female pattern baldness. Other types of hair loss include alopecia areata, caused by an autoimmune disease, and scarring alopecia, caused by permanent destruction of hair follicles due to trauma, burns, or infection. If your hair feels oily and brushes quickly, you're in the ‘early stages of hair loss’ In the early stages of hair loss, the hair on the crown and front of the head is thinner than the hair in the back. Also, the hair follicles are smaller, and the sebaceous glands are more prominent, which can lead to increased oiliness. So, if you notice that your hair is greasier than usual and feels softer to comb, you may have hair loss. Hair loss can be slowed down and significantly reversed if diagnosed early, and proper treatment is started. Other signs of hair loss include losing more than 100 hairs per day or a receding hairline. Doctors diagnose hair loss by looking at the condition of your scalp, hair density, thickness, and bald patches. A dermatologist may examine 50 to 60 strands of hair to see if more than five (10 percent) fall out when gently pulled or use a dermatoscopy or hair imaging to check the density, thickness, and growth rate of hair. A scalp biopsy may also be performed to check the health of the hair follicles. Hereditary hair loss is difficult to cure, but medication can slow down the process Hair loss treatment depends on the type of hair loss. Hereditary hair loss isn’t easy to cure but can be slowed down or alleviated with medication. In the early stages, it is usually treated with “oral medications” (finasteride and dutasteride) that block the 5-α-reductase enzyme needed to produce the hormone DHT. Once hair loss has progressed, topical medications, including minoxidil, stimulate hair follicles to enter the growth phase. The combination of topical and oral medications has a synergistic effect. Since anagen hair grows at about 1 centimeter per month, it takes about six months of treatment to see significant results, and hair loss can recur if you stop taking the medication. For more advanced hair loss, autologous hair transplantation, which involves harvesting hair from the back of the head and transplanting it to the front, is compelling. The back of the scalp has relatively less androgen receptor expression than the forehead or crown of the head, so hair retention is better even when hair loss is severe. Protecting the remaining hair with medication after transplantation achieves the best cosmetic results. In other cases, finding the cause of the hair loss is essential, as it can take months to recover once the cause is eliminated. Alopecia areata caused by an autoimmune disease is treated with topical steroids or immunotherapy. In scarring alopecia, the hair follicles are permanently destroyed, and it’s impossible to regenerate hair, so hair transplants are the primary treatment. Rapid weight loss, obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease can also affect hair loss In addition to treating hair loss, there are other things you can do to help manage it. First, it's important to maintain your weight, as both rapid weight loss and obesity can negatively impact hair loss. You should also avoid a Westernized diet high in fat and sugar and eat plenty of antioxidant-rich foods. Aerobic exercise is recommended, as it helps to regulate the hormonal environment in women. It's also essential for women with hair loss to manage their underlying medical conditions, as uncontrolled diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and kidney disease can hurt hair loss. Also, since hair follicles have a biological cycle, it's best to go to sleep and wake up as soon as possible. Irregular sleeping patterns can lead to resting hair loss. Quitting smoking can also help manage hair loss. This is because smoking is one of the main risk factors for oxidative stress, which causes aging and can also exacerbate hair loss. In addition, avoiding hair styling that involves tying your hair tightly or using excessive heat can help control hair loss. “Hair loss is part of the aging process, and just like aging, it is difficult to completely cure hair loss. However, it can be improved through early detection and active management, so if your hair is thinning and falling out, you should visit a hospital for a consultation,” Professor Kwon said. “A balanced diet, regular lifestyle, smoking cessation, and stress management can help slow hair loss.” Related articles [kkw97@docdocdoc.co.kr](mailto:kkw97@docdocdoc.co.kr)",

    "text": "MONTREAL — About 2,600 unionized employees from hotels in some of the province's largest cities walked off the job Thursday, protesting an impasse in contract talks. The 24-hour strike hit 23 hotels in Montreal, Quebec City and Sherbrooke. Éric Hamel, general manager of an association representing Montreal hotels, said that despite the strike it was business as usual in the city. Negotiations between hotel owners and the workers' union — Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) — have stalled since the union first threatened a provincewide strike last week. Hotel employees have seven key demands, including a 36 per cent pay raise over four years and an end to the use of private employment agencies. Hamel says the employers are ready to negotiate but do not have the capacity to pay the salary demands. The strike involved 16 Montreal hotels, including the Queen Elizabeth, Bonaventure and The Ritz-Carlton, five in the Quebec City region and two in Sherbrooke. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 8, 2024. The Canadian Press",

    "text": "El Gobierno de Baleares pide a la ciudadanía que se quede en casa por las lluvias La DANA ha descargado a lo largo de este viernes más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado en puntos del oeste de Mallorca Actualizada 17:46 El Govern balear ha lanzado este viernes la recomendación a la ciudadanía de no salir de casa. «Todos en casa. Mucha precaución en las próximas horas», ha pedido el Ejecutivo autonómico en un mensaje en redes sociales. El mensaje del Ejecutivo insta igualmente a la ciudadanía a evitar garajes y sótanos, permanecer en las zonas altas de las casas, asegurar puertas y ventanas, retirar del exterior de las viviendas lo que pueda ser arrastrado y dejar en lugares seguros medicamentos, documentación, elementos de valor y agua potable. Este aviso viene después de que la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología haya establecido la alerta naranja en todas las islas por grandes acumulaciones de agua, que podrían rondar los 100-150 litros por metro cuadrado. Unas cantidades que ya se han producido en el oeste de Mallorca y se desplazan al resto de la isla. La DANA ha descargado a lo largo de este viernes más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado en puntos del oeste de Mallorca. Según los primeros balances de la Aemet consultados por Europa Press, hasta las 15.30 horas se han recogido en la Sierra de Alfabia-Buñola 85 litros/m2 y algo más de 20 litros/m2 en Andratx-San Telmo y el puerto de Sóller. La DGT, por su parte, ha pedido evitar los desplazamientos por carretera en Baleares y Emergencias mantiene activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en todo el archipiélago. El IG1 se activa cuando la información meteorológica permite prever la inminencia de un fenómeno adverso con probabilidad elevada de riesgo para personas y bienes y se declara en aquella situación en la que se puede producir un fenómeno adverso en zonas localizadas, la atención de la cual puede quedar asegurada con los medios y recursos disponibles en las zonas afectadas pero con seguimiento supramunicipal. Este nivel de alerta contempla una prealerta de movilización de medios.",
