    "title": "Report: Byron Leftwich joining Colorado coaching staff",
    "text": "Former NFL quarterback and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich is joining the coaching staff under Deion Sanders at Colorado, Jordan Schultz of Fox Sports reported Wednesday. The reports come a day after Leftwich was spotted at practice holding a clipboard and wearing Colorado football gear. Sanders said on Monday Colorado would make \"a couple more huge moves\" this week but has not confirmed Leftwich's hiring. It's unclear what Leftwich's role will be on Sanders' staff. Leftwich interviewed with the New England Patriots for their head coaching post in January. Leftwich, 45, most recently worked as the offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2019-22, a stint that included a Super Bowl win in the 2020 season. Leftwich was fired by Bucs head coach Todd Bowles after the 2022 season, which saw Tampa Bay slip from the top 3 in scoring the previous three seasons to No. 15 in yards and No. 25 in points in 2022. A quarterback and first-round pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2003 NFL Draft, Leftwich had a 24-26 record with 10,532 passing yards and 58 touchdowns in 60 games with the Jaguars (2003-06), Atlanta Falcons (2007), Bucs (2009) and Steelers (2008, 2010, 2012). He also worked in various roles including the interim offensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals from 2016-2018. --Field Level Media\nWire\nReport: Byron Leftwich joining Colorado coaching staff\n- Field Level Media\n- Updated\nComments\nWant to praise someone or get something off your chest?

J'assume l'entière responsabilité artistique (...). Nous n'avons visé personne, nous n'avons pas créé cette polémique\", a estimé Mme Le Pladec.\n\"L'art fait réagir, il peut être clivant. Le propre de l'art est de communiquer, donc à partir du moment où on communique il y a un dialogue mais ça ne justifie pas le cyberharcèlement et les menaces de mort\", a-t-elle ajouté.\n\"Nous étions avant tout au service d'un projet artistique qui a touché des millions de personnes en France et à l'étranger et qui nous manifestent leur soutien\", selon elle.\nL'enquête, confiée initialement à la Brigade de répression de la délinquance contre la personne (BRDP), est désormais aux mains de l'Office central de lutte contre les crimes contre l'humanité et les crimes de haine (OCLCH), a indiqué le parquet.\nLa cérémonie d'ouverture de l'événement sportif mondial, le 26 juillet le long de la Seine, a été vivement critiquée par des autorités religieuses et des responsables politiques conservateurs à travers le monde.\nDes enquêtes ont été ouvertes après les plaintes pour menaces de mort et cyberharcèlement du directeur artistique Thomas Jolly et la DJ française Barbara Butch, militante féministe et lesbienne.\nLa drag queen Nicky Doll a pour sa part porté plainte contre l'ancien acteur britannique reconverti dans la politique Laurence Fox.

    "title": "Northern Lights could be visible in UK tonight thanks to solar flare",
    "text": "The Northern Lights, also known as the aurora borealis, could be visible in parts of the UK on January 1 and January 2 thanks to a solar flare. The Met Office space\nweather centre says there is a chance of moderate and strong flares - as well as the chance of a G1 minor storm - thanks to a hole in the surface of the sun.\nA large hole opened in the Sun's corona at the end of 2023 and the solar wind radiation is now crashing into the Earth's atmosphere. As the magnetic storm meets the layer of charged gases around the Earth it generates waves of green, blue and purple light visible in dark skies.\nThe Met Office says there are currently four sunspots on the surface of the Sun which are sending radiation towards the Earth. A spokesman said: \"Connection to the fast wind from a coronal hole is anticipated during 1 Jan (Monday). This is likely to give a limited enhancement to the aurora, and also through 2 Jan, with the potential for some glimpses.\"\nThe Northern Lights are most likely to be seen in Northern Scotland. The British Geological Survey recorded a massive solar flare on December 14.\nThey said: \"This flare is the strongest in this solar cycle, and the largest seen in the last six years\"\nA G1 (or minor) geomagnetic storm is the mildest category of geomagnetic storms. These storms are caused by fluctuations in the solar wind that interacts with Earth's magnetosphere. They are typically characterized by minor disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field.\nDuring a G1 storm, there might be some minor impacts such as weak power grid fluctuations, minor effects on satellite operations, and slight disturbances in migratory animals' navigation systems. While G1 storms are considered minor and usually have minimal impact on technological systems and infrastructure, they can still cause some beautiful auroras visible at higher latitudes.\nThe scale used to categorize geomagnetic storms ranges from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme), with each level representing increasing intensity of the storm's effects on Earth's magnetosphere.\nThe Northern Lights are created when charged particles from the sun, mostly electrons and protons, collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere, usually around 60 to 200 miles above the Earth's surface. These collisions emit light, creating stunning displays of colourful curtains, arcs, or swirls of light in the sky. The colours commonly seen in auroras are green, pink, red, purple, blue, and yellow, depending on the type of gas particles being ionized and their altitude in the atmosphere.\nThe Earth's magnetic field directs these charged particles towards the polar regions, which is why the Northern Lights are primarily visible in high-latitude regions. Auroras occur year-round, but they are more commonly observed during the winter months when nights are longer and skies are darker.",

    "title": "'Is there no shame!' Catholic El Paso migrant shelter DENIES running human smuggling ring and blasts Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton for calling 'House of God a stash house' - WhatsNew2Day",
    "text": "A Catholic migrant shelter in El Paso has responded to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton over “baseless” allegations that the charity runs a human trafficking ring. Annunciation House, a well-known and respected immigrant charity in West Texas, has been charged with “harboring aliens, human trafficking, and operating a stash house” by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Earlier this week, the Lone Star State’s top prosecutor said he would shut down the nonprofit by suspending its business license for refusing to hand over documents he wanted. Flanked by El Paso’s top religious and elected leaders, Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia called Paxton’s actions an attack on Catholic groups doing the work of the Gospel. ‘Personally, I am baffled by the use of words like “smuggling.” Calling our houses of hospitality “hideaways.” Isn’t it shameful to refer to the houses of God and houses of hospitality as “hiding places,” Garcia said? Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton demanded documents from Annunciation House, an immigrant charity in El Paso, Texas, on February 7. Migrant children from different Latin American countries rest on cots inside one of several shelters run by Annunciation House in El Paso, Texas. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, photographed Feb. 16, leaving a Houston court hearing for a felony security fraud case in which he is a defendant. Annunciation House has welcomed immigrants for 46 years, providing them with a place to stay, meals and a place to wash when they enter the U.S. in El Paso, after they have been legally screened, screened and released by federal immigration authorities. in the country. . Most of the migrants who pass through El Paso do not stay in the border city, but rather the vast majority travel to other places in the United States. Annunciation House volunteers also help connect immigrants with friends and family who can buy a ticket out of town. On Feb. 7, the Republican state attorney sent lawyers to Annunciation House, giving the organization one day to turn over the records “without explanation,” the religious group said. “The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) reviewed important public records information that strongly suggests that Annunciation House is involved in legal violations such as facilitating illegal entry into the United States, harboring aliens, human smuggling, and operating a safe house.” , Paxton’s office alleged. on his own [Tuesday press release](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-end-ngos-operations-texas-after-discovering-potential-efforts). In legal documents, Paxton pointed to news coverage of Annunciation House, where the organization admitted to housing “migrants who avoided Border Patrol” when they illegally crossed the southern border. Migrant families are dropped off at an Annunciation House in El Paso, Texas, after being processed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in December 2022. The director of the House of the Annunciation, Rubén García, described Ken Paxton’s actions as “immoral” and “illegal” Migrant children from different Latin American countries wait to receive food at a new center opened by Annunciation House to help the large flow of migrants released by the United States Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in El Paso, Texas, on April 24, 2019. Asylum-seeking migrants are dropped off at Annunciation House in El Paso in December 2022 after being screened by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. When Annunciation House’s attorney told Paxton’s office it would respond within 30 days, the attorney general’s office told the charity they would close. The nonprofit sued to block Paxton’s records request and what his attorney called “government overreach.” “Attorney General Paxton claims he can walk into any business at any time and demand any document he wants, including customer records, medical records and legal records,” attorney Jerry Wasevich said Friday. “He claims that if the company does not perform to his satisfaction, he can permanently close it in Texas.” The actions of Paxton, a Republican, were largely considered political by Democratic leaders in Texas’ sixth-largest city. “If you mess with Ruben, you mess with Annunciation House, you’re messing with us,” County Judge Ricardo Samaniego defiantly declared Friday. “We’re going to show that that’s the line in the sand.” El Paso has fought political and legal battles against the state’s Republican leadership before, including during the pandemic over masks and business closures. Most recently, El Paso County sued the state over SB4, a Texas law that would allow state and local police to detain anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant. However, the courts have not yet made a final decision and the law is scheduled to come into force on March 4. Local leaders warned that Paxton’s intention was to shut down any religious groups that were helping immigrants, something many far-right politicians disapprove of. “What we are seeing is part of a broader and terrifying attack on welcoming communities,” explained local congresswoman Verónica Escobar. ‘I can tell you that in the United States Congress, far-right members of the Republican Party have done everything they can to eliminate local governments and organizations that provide humanitarian care to immigrants. I have heard in the House Judiciary Committee that Republican colleagues are denouncing and attacking Catholic Charities and the Catholic Church.’ Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, front left, speaks with his defense attorney Anthony Osso, Jr., during a hearing in his securities fraud case, Friday, Feb. 16, in Texas County Criminal Court. Harris in Houston. A judge on Friday rejected Paxton’s attempts to dismiss felony securities fraud charges that have dogged the Republican for nearly a decade. Ken Paxton mega-donor Nate Paul was indicted by the feds last year. The Texas businessman at the center of an FBI investigation that he and Paxton entered into an illegal quid pro quo, with Paxton helping Paul with legal problems in exchange for Paul hiring Paxton’s mistress. Ken Paxton’s affair with his former lover, Laura Olson, is central to accusations that Ken Paxton broke the law. Paxton has been under FBI investigation for years, with accusations of corruption and abuse of power. He also faces state charges in unrelated criminal cases. In May, the Republican was impeached by the Texas House of Representatives, with allegations of an illegal quid pro quo: that Paxton helped one of his wealthy donors, Nate Paul, in exchange for that same donor giving the company a job. Paxton’s lover, Laura Olson. Paxton survived removal from office but faces multiple criminal investigations in the Lone Star State.

    "text": "NEW HAVEN, Conn. — A kidnapping suspect attacked officers in Hamden while being taken into custody Wednesday, according to New Haven police . Derrick Gilliam, 29, is facing charges in multiple towns, including New Haven, in connection to a kidnapping, and East Haven, related to a domestic violence incident. Hamden police said they have an arrest warrant for Gilliam on a protective order violation and will be applying for an additional arrest warrant after he fought with officers while being taken into custody. Gilliam has 11 outstanding arrest warrants, according to New Haven police. At 11:27 a.m. Wednesday, New Haven officers went to the emergency department of St. Raphael's hospital after receiving a report about a person who was assaulted. The victim told officers that she was kidnapped by Gilliam, who she knew. New Haven police said they were told that she left her house and was getting into her friend's car to go to work when Gilliam suddenly ran up to her and punched her. Gilliam then allegedly picked the victim up and threw her in his car, police said. The victim told officers that he continued assaulting her while \"driving recklessly through the city\" and threatened to throw her out of the vehicle. The victim said she was able to escape the car in East Haven after Gilliam pulled into a parking lot and that she spotted an officer who called for medical attention. Gilliam had taken off from the scene before police could respond, according to New Haven police. East Haven police told Hamden officers that they were trying to find and arrest Gilliam on domestic violence charges for an incident that took place in their town. They also noted that he was threatening to take his own life and wanted to be killed by police. After East Haven police learned Gilliam was in the area of Hamden Plaza, Hamden police said they found his car parked in the plaza. Officers approached the car to take Gilliam into custody when he got out and began fighting with them, Hamden police said. He allegedly yelled at the officers to \"kill him\" and \"bit, scratched and attempted to punch\" the officers before being arrested. Multiple officers were injured during the struggle, according to Hamden police. Gilliam was turned over to New Haven police to face charges from the city's police department. New Haven police said he is being guarded at the hospital on a $500,000 bond for kidnapping and other charges and was expected to appear at New Haven Superior Court Friday.

    "text": "agenzia\nBufera sul partner sciamano della principessa norvegese Martha\nOffre consigli su come affrontare suicidio causato da 'spirito'\nSTOCCOLMA, 29 DIC – Durek Verrett, il compagno sciamano della principessa norvegese Märtha Louise, figlia del re Harald V, ha suscitato accese polemiche dopo aver pubblicato un video sul suo profilo Instagram in cui offre consigli su come affrontare “lo spirito suicida”. Nel video, pubblicato ieri, Verrett ammette che si tratta di un argomento delicato e prosegue dando i suoi consigli da sciamano su come scacciare lo spirito. Le affermazioni hanno suscitato reazioni da parte di diverse persone, tra cui Petter Eide dell’associazione ‘Leve’, che fornisce supporto ai chi ha tentato di togliersi la vita: “Sostiene che il suicidio sia causato da uno spirito che si è insediato nel corpo e che possa essere scacciato usando la forza mentale.” ha affermato Eide al quotidiano norvegese VG. “Non riesco a esprimere quanto mi sconvolga sentire queste sciocchezze. Sta giocando con la vita delle persone”, ha aggiunto. Secondo l’Istituto di Sanità Norvegese, oltre 600 persone si tolgono la vita ogni anno in Norvegia, un dato significativo per un Paese con una popolazione di 5,5 milioni di abitanti. A confronto, il numero annuale di vittime per incidenti stradali si aggira intorno alle 100 persone.",

    "text": "Photo: Marianna Massey/DigitalVision/Getty Images\nChain restaurants and popular eateries are great, but there's something about sitting down at a locally famous hole-in-the-wall or a longtime favorite mom and pop shop that has been serving up tried and true delicious meals for years that just hits home.\nUsing reviews, awards and accolades as well as first-hand experience, LoveFood compiled a list of the \"best mom and pop restaurant\" in every state, eateries that have been a mainstay of the community for decades or establishments that serve up family recipes that have been perfected over several generations.\nAccording to the site, the best mom and pop restaurant in all of North Carolina is Bum's Restaurant, an eatery in Ayden that serves standout dishes like barbecue classics and fried chicken. Bum's Restaurant , located at 566 E 3rd Street, has a 4.4 star rating on Google and nearly 500 reviews.\nHere's what the site had to say about this restaurant offering \"incredible comfort food\":\n\"There's a lot of competition when it comes to barbecue in North Carolina, but this family-owned spot earns plaudits for its delectably meaty mains, friendly vibe, and wallet-friendly prices. There's much praise for the classic barbecue plates, which are piled high with meats like slow-cooked pulled pork, plus trimmings — think collard greens and mac 'n' cheese.\" Check out the full list at lovefood.com to read up on more of the best mom and pop restaurants in the country.",
