    "text": "Deputy Majority Leader and Quezon City Rep. Patrick Michael Vargas said he is elated about the multi-stakeholder cooperation as the La Mesa Ecopark reopened to the public on June 29.\nThe park has been closed for over four months due to the end of the 25-year-old stewardship of Bantay Kalikasan.\n“For this place to be in my district, I’m one of the luckiest congressmen already,” Vargas said.\nAccording to Vargas, expressing confidence in the leadership of Mayor Joy Belmonte, who he said is the “fiercest environmentalist” he has ever met.\nLa Mesa is the last ecological frontier of the National Capital Region, covering 2,659 hectares of forest and watershed areas which is the primary source of potable drinking water for close to 12 million residents of Metro Manila. The forest area, in its part, is home to 520 vulnerable and endangered flora and fauna.\nVargas emphasized his commitment to making this a better place for future generations. He has filed and passed on third and final reading House Bill 5301 or An Act Declaring La Mesa Ecopark as a Tourism Site.\nThe proposed measure seeks to provide a development plan that aims to rehabilitate, reforest, preserve and protect La Mesa while promoting its highest tourism potential and value, thereby providing jobs and revenue for the local government.\n“These efforts have already been fought for by my brother, former Congressman Alfred Vargas since the Sixteenth Congress. We will continue the fight until we put forward what is best for our people and for this God-given gift of nature,” the lawmaker said.\nHe also prodded the new management under Manila Water Foundation of their shared vision towards a greener future. A Memorandum of Agreement has been signed for the administration of the La Mesa Ecopark, including its rehabilitation and maintenance operations. The new and improved park is set for completion next year.\n“La Mesa, for me, is a sanctuary. This is a privilege for our fellow Novaleños given a close access to this natural gem. It can also aid better mental health, job and livelihood opportunities, and priceless memories with friends and families,” Vargas said.\nThe Ecopark is open from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM on Tuesdays to Sundays. No entrance fee will be charged to QCitizens. Non-QC residents can enjoy the park with a minimal entrance fee of P20.00.",

The rain in combination with the freezing temperatures has already led to a few accidents, [the AD reported](https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/regen-en-kou-zorgen-voor-spekgladde-wegen-en-ongelukken-verkeer-in-het-hele-land-moet-oppassen~a35deaf7/). At least two incidents of cars going off the road on Friday morning have been reported.\nThe first incident occurred at 7 a.m. when a car went off the N356 in De Valom, Friesland. The driver was seriously injured, and the car ended up head-first in the water. A car also ended up in the water in Wervershoof, Noord-Holland. The driver and a dog that was in the car just about got out on time.\nGritter trucks from infrastructure agency Rijkswaterstaat spread over 3.1 million kilograms of salt on Dutch highways and national roads starting at about 7 p.m. on Thursday. The trucks drove nearly 45,000 kilometers in 14 hours in anticipation of the adverse conditions.\nSo far this season, nearly 17.3 million kilograms of salt have been dumped on the roadways by a total of 1,500 workers. They operate the agency’s 577 gritter trucks and salt storage facilities, as well as about 630 snow plows.\nThe company that is responsible for the maintenance of the roads handed out tips to drivers on X. “‘Are you going out? Then keep extra distance from the vehicle in front of you and adjust your speed if necessary. Did you encounter our gritting vehicles on the road? Then give them space so they can do their job.” The KNMI weather station has not issued a code yellow for today.\nThe slippery roads will disappear late in the morning. Temperatures will rise to 3 to 5 degrees Celsius. It will be freezing on Friday evening, which is likely to result in more slippy roads on Saturday morning.",

It really hurts as a teammate. It really hurts to see these boys in pain and also getting this criticism.\n“We are working very hard on the pitch. We are trying to give everything for the fans, for the country … Please protect the players, my team mates and the team. Before they are a player, they are a person. They have families back home, with kids,” he continued.\nSouth Korea last won the Asian Cup in 1960, but drawing twice in three matches and shipping six goals in a modest group has cast doubts over their credentials as one of the tournament favourites. The Koreans have individual talent in abundance, but they haven’t demonstrated much cohesion in their play as a team.\nSon said the draw with Malaysia serves as a wake-up call before the Koreans meet Saudi Arabia in the round of 16.\n“When you go into the tournament, there are no favourites because there will always be underdogs that catch you out,” said Son.\n“For Asian football, it is really good that this competition is becoming even harder. Everybody is more interested in this competition now, which is a very good sign. It was a tough result to take but it’s a big credit to the Malaysian team, they fought until the end and I was very pleased for Asian football.”\nContact the writer of this story at\n[moc.l1706218659labto1706218659ofdlr1706218659owedi1706218659sni@g1706218659niwe.1706218659yrrah1706218659](javascript:;)",
