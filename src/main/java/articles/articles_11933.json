    "title": "The timeless journey of 'Pass It On' - Baptist News Global",
    "text": "Hundreds of thousands have viewed the short, hand-held video taken by a nurse on a bus carrying the surviving young girls from Camp Mystic the morning after the horrific July 4 floods in Kerr County, Texas, that left at least 136 dead and a handful still missing.\nIn the shaky video, the girls — after long minutes of seeing the sheer devastation and carnage from the fury of Guadalupe River — suddenly, unexpectedly begin singing Kurt Kaiser’s beloved “Pass It On.”\nIf you’re a Baby Boomer growing up in evangelical circles primarily (but not exclusively) in Southern California or the South, “Pass It On” is one of the touchstones of your faith journey.\nThat the children in one of the most beloved religious camps in Texas still sing the gentle little song 55 years after Kaiser first composed it is vivid proof that it is — if your denomination is comfortable with the word · anointed.\nFor Kaiser, who died in 2018, “Pass It On” was only one of a host of memorable songs he composed during his long career in Christian music. The song was written in 1969 for a youth musical he co-composed with another early contemporary Christian music legend, Ralph Carmichael, Tell It Like It Is.\nKurt, who often played piano at my church, Seventh and James Baptist in Waco, Texas, once told me the lyrics took about 20 minutes to write. They’re vivid, direct and easy to remember — like a spiritual or a folk song. The music is equally accessible, whether in a church on a massive pipe organ or with a battered acoustic guitar around a campfire.\nPerhaps the most striking use of “Pass It On” prior to the Camp Mystic tragedy was at Explo ’72 in Dallas, at the time the largest gathering of evangelical youth in history. Explo ’72 was created by Campus Crusade for Christ and other religious organizations to equip and inspire the children of the burgeoning “Youth Revival” that swept through the country in the late 1960s. Following a week of instruction, praise and music, more than 80,000 young people gathered that evening for a massive rally, a candle-lit “Great Commission” service, where each person lit the candle of the person next to them as they sang “Pass It On.”\nThat night, during the concert, Texas thunderstorms swept through the area. And the rains came — despite the pleas and prayers of the attendees — who continued to sing and worship God.\nContemporary Christian music historian Paul Baker writes that Kaiser told him he watched the news coverage of Explo ’72 from a motel room in Cincinnati. ”It was probably one of the most moving experiences of my life,” he recalled. “I never would have imagined that one simple song would go so far.”\nI can remember the young women from First Baptist Woodville, Texas, excitedly going to Camp Mystic in the early 1970s while I attended a small high school in East Texas. Since its founding in 1926, generations of families have considered Mystic a much-loved rite of passage for Christian girls, a magical place full of memories, traditions (Tonkawas vs. Kiowas!), Bible study, outdoor activities, praise and worship sessions — all in a beautiful, idyllic setting.\nWill Camp Mystic ever recover? Or was everything lost in those few terrifying minutes? That’s not for us to say.\nAnd it’s also uncertain whether the young girls singing “Pass It On” on the bus understood the scale of the destruction, or if they’ve even had been told that some of their friends had been lost. In the longer (8.5 minute) version, they can be heard gasping in horror at the scenes they pass along the Guadalupe on the bus ride to safety.\nBut at some point in their journey, as if by some unknown and unknowable shared signal, they break into one of the most treasured religious songs of past 50 years.\nAnd, in that instant, it becomes both a testament to resilience of their faith and a tribute to an inspired song written by a modest man whose lone goal was to create a song that all young people could sing.\nI wish for you my friend\nThis happiness that I’ve found;\nYou can depend on God\nIt matters not where you’re bound,\nI’ll shout it from the mountain top — praise God!\nI want the world to know\nThe Lord of love has come to me\nI want to pass it on.\nRobert F. Darden is emeritus professor of journalism, public relations and new media at Baylor University where he also founded the Black Gospel Music Preservation Project.\nRelated article:\nKurt Kaiser helped contemporary Christian musicians ‘pass it on’",

    "title": "Feature: New travel permit, latest jargon among expats, businesses in Hong Kong-Xinhua",
    "text": "HONG KONG, Aug. 1 (Xinhua) -- For many non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents, the month of August unfolds with not just scorching heat, intermittent showers and forced stay indoors, but \"fresh starts\" of more flexible and leisurely journeys.\nFrom now on, and for the next five years, they will be traveling at ease with their new travel permits, the first batch of which having been issued starting Wednesday.\nA Singaporean surnamed Wong and her family were among those who were queuing to get their \"dream permits\" at an application service center for mainland travel permits in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong, on Day One of the permit's issuance.\n\"We are super excited to get the permits so that we can travel to the Chinese mainland much more easily. We're planning to take our kids to nearby Shenzhen and some other mainland cities in a week or two,\" said Wong. Wong said she and her family have lately been taken away by tempting cuisine options and landscape shots of Chinese mainland cities on Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like app popular among the Chinese.\n\"With a new permit, we can literally go anytime we want, for example, on the weekend,\" she told Xinhua.\nIn fact, many shared the joy of Wong. According to stipulations, holders of the permit will be allowed multiple entries into the Chinese mainland within a five-year validity period, with each stay not exceeding 90 days.\nAfter receiving his permit, an Indian businessman by the name of Rajim said he \"couldn't wait\" to see for himself what those second and third-tier cities in the Chinese mainland are like. In the past, he has been to metropolises including Beijing and Shanghai, but is now yearning to see around influencer city Chengdu.\n\"I filled up my form right away on July 10, Day One of the application, and later had my fingerprint, photo and documents collected. On-site procedures took no more than 15 minutes. And I now get my permit in about three weeks,\" he said. \"The whole process went on relatively smoothly.\"\n\"With a new pass, it will definitely be much more convenient because I no longer have to line up. I'm gonna experience the express channel at the border with a card almost as handy as the Octopus Card,\" said Gary Lim, a member of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong) committee, who came here for the permits with his wife, also an applicant, and was planning to visit a few mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in mid-August.\nAlfred Buchner, a former committee member of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao, who came to pick up his permit with his wife and daughter, called this new measure \"a boon for expats like himself based in Hong Kong,\" as they will be able to arrange their trips to the Chinese mainland more flexibly without restrictions by scenic spot reservations, hotel bookings or the weather.\nPaul McComb, executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told Xinhua earlier that with the implementation of the new travel policy, Hong Kong, with an enabling business environment and internationally-aligned legal and tax systems, will further leverage its role as a \"super connector\" between the Chinese mainland and the overseas, and is expected to be more appealing because \"capital will flow to where the opportunities are.\"\nPrior to the issuance, many Hongkongers said the time queueing for entry could last for up to an hour, but now things are \"going electronic\" in many ways. Dato' Gan Khai Choon, chair of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao and a seasoned entrepreneur himself, said the permit will benefit him, a frequent visitor to the Chinese mainland, hugely.\n\"The smoother travel can potentially draw a growing list of businessmen and professionals like me who have the demand to travel around between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong,\" Gan said, adding that up till now, dozens of members of his chamber have filed their applications. ■",

    "title": "Divorce bill passage a challenge to the Church ministry, says Cardinal Advincula",
    "text": "MANILA Archbishop Cardinal Jose Advincula on Saturday, May 25, 2024, said he sees the passage of the divorce bill in the House of Representatives as a looming challenge to the Catholic Church, especially to its ministry on matrimony, and in helping problematic marriages. In a radio interview, Advincula said they view the bill's passage as a challenge that requires recalibrated efforts from the Catholic Church. \"We take it as a challenge to recalibrate our efforts in ministering to couples in difficult situations. There is a need to truly accompany them in their perilous journey as a couple and as a family,\" said Advincula. \"The passage of divorce bill in the House of Representatives should not deter us from working doubly hard for the sake of marriage and the family,\" he added. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved on third and final reading a bill seeking to legalize absolute divorce in the country. Voting 126-109 with 20 abstentions, the lawmakers passed the bill that seeks to institute absolute divorce as an alternative mode of dissolving an irreparably broken or dysfunctional marriage in the country. Advincula said the divorce law is not a magic pill that can solve marital problems. \"The fact remains that divorce is not the ultimate solution to problematic unions,” he said. Instead of legalizing divorce, the Cardinal said it would be better if the prevailing mechanisms for couples, such as annulment, will just be amended. \"It is our hope that Congress may reform such existing legal remedies so that they do not become burdensome for couples in need of them,\" said Advincula.

    "text": "[La giunta militare](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/dal-myanmar-un-patto-tra-le-opposizioni-armate-farebbe-cadere-i-militari-ci-serve-il-vostro-aiuto/2720664/), per mantenere il potere, bombarda senza ritegno anche i centri abitati dove hanno sede le famiglie di origine dell’attuale classe dirigente del Paese. Una guerra (civile) senza quartiere nella quale la resistenza ha già sottratto agli autori del golpe del 2021 parte del territorio nazionale, senza che questo significhi, però, aver intaccato veramente il potere dei militari. Quello del [Myanmar](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/dal-myanmar-un-patto-tra-le-opposizioni-armate-farebbe-cadere-i-militari-ci-serve-il-vostro-aiuto/2720664/), anche se totalmente dimenticato a livello mediatico, è un conflitto fondamentale nello scacchiere asiatico, perché proprio lì, osserva Ranieri Sabatucci, ambasciatore UE nel Myanmar, la Cina cerca un’alternativa allo stretto di Malacca, dove passa gran parte del commercio internazionale. Per questo [Pechino](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/dal-myanmar-i-golpisti-umiliano-aung-san-suu-kyi-ma-sono-bocciati-dalla-cina/2692910/), insieme alla Russia, sostiene la giunta militare, mentre USA e UE hanno comminato sanzioni relative a diversi settori economici. L’Europa ha comunque interessi economici nel Paese ed è presente con alcune ONG. Della situazione in Myanmar, Sabatucci parlerà proprio oggi alle 14 al Meeting di Rimini, insieme ad AVSI, una delle organizzazioni che opera sul territorio birmano. In Myanmar continua la contrapposizione fra la giunta militare e la resistenza, che rappresenta una realtà molto composita. Qual è la situazione in questo momento? In Myanmar, da tre anni e mezzo, l’attuale governo è in conflitto con il resto del Paese: tutti ce l’hanno con i militari al potere. Lo scontro della giunta è anche con i Bama, cioè con il loro gruppo etnico, che costituisce il 60% del Paese. I militari uccidono e bombardano villaggi da cui sono provenuti loro stessi o le loro famiglie. Tra i gruppi etnici che si oppongono, alcuni sono più allineati con i Paesi vicini, altri sono più autonomi. Si presenta spesso la resistenza come frammentata, ma non è un elemento così strano: il Paese non è mai stato unificato, vive da sempre in una realtà frammentata. Ci sono contatti tra i gruppi che si oppongono alla giunta militare? Alcuni gruppi importanti sono in contatto. C’è un’autorità che si sente di rappresentare il Paese a livello generale, il NUG (National Unity Government), accusato di essere troppo vicino all’etnia Bama: collabora con una serie di gruppi etnici e ha contatti meno intensi pure con altri gruppi. Chi sta avendo il sopravvento? La giunta militare controlla tutto il Paese? Il regime continua a perdere terreno ma non è ancora con le spalle al muro. Controlla i centri urbani principali, anche se ne ha perso qualcuno, quindi la vecchia capitale e quella attuale, più una regione del sud-ovest. Non ha controllo, però, su gran parte del Paese. Alcuni analisti dell’opposizione dicono che quest’ultima ha il controllo del 70% del territorio, ma ci sono zone alle quali i militari, pur non essendo presenti, potrebbero comunque accedere se lo volessero. Insomma, per la giunta militare il trend è negativo, ma non siamo vicini al punto finale. La repressione da parte della giunta militare viene descritta come brutale. È così? Il Myanmar aveva uno degli eserciti più potenti della zona, anche se ora la resistenza ha ridotto il gap. L’esercito ha atteggiamenti incomprensibili dal punto di vista umano, di violenza e barbarie nei confronti di persone che sono membri della loro stessa comunità. È un conflitto orrendo, brutale. La comunità internazionale sta agendo in qualche modo? Che ruolo ha la Cina? La comunità internazionale è estremamente divisa, il Consiglio di sicurezza dell’ONU non produce mai niente sul Myanmar perché Russia e Cina si oppongono. Pechino è passata sempre di più a sostenere la giunta militare: difende i suoi interessi. La Russia è il più grande fornitore di armi e sa benissimo che verranno usate contro la gente. Perché il Myanmar è così importante per i cinesi? È un Paese strategico. La grande debolezza cinese oggi è che, per il commercio e la sicurezza, dipende dallo stretto di Malacca, tra Singapore e Indonesia. Il commercio petrolifero e internazionale passa di lì. Per questo sta cercando delle alternative: quella più efficace è di creare un sistema di comunicazione tra la Cina e la costa del Myanmar. Per questo ha costruito una pipeline. In più, il Myanmar, in cui Pechino è leader negli investimenti, è ricchissimo di materie prime, minerali rari, gioielli. Quella di essere [autonomi](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/dal-myanmar-e-una-pasqua-di-paura-siamo-in-balia-della-cina-e-dimenticati-dalloccidente/2684202/) dalla Cina è la preoccupazione storica del popolo birmano. USA e UE hanno preso iniziative? Noi abbiamo tre obiettivi: uno è di sostenere un ritorno effettivo alla democrazia, il secondo di aiutare il popolo birmano, vittima della situazione, il terzo è cercare di mantenere una presenza europea, non solo dal punto di vista economico, ma anche per quanto riguarda le organizzazioni non governative. Quindi c’è una presenza europea? Sì. Non a livello dei cinesi, ma c’è. L’Europa ha applicato sanzioni per l’80% simili a quelle degli USA. Abbiamo sanzionato l’ente del gas del Myanmar, gli americani no perché danneggerebbe i loro partner thailandesi. Per contro, gli Stati Uniti hanno sanzionato le banche statali e noi europei no. Anche Gran Bretagna, Canada e Australia hanno optato per le sanzioni. Ma in che modo la UE è presente? Dal 2012, dall’inizio del processo delle riforme economiche, fino al 2015, l’anno in cui Aung San Suu Kyi ha vinto le elezioni, fino al colpo di Stato, c’è stato un periodo di progresso economico, con parecchi investitori europei. Al Paese sono stati offerti dei privilegi commerciali: ancora oggi la Birmania può esportare duty-free quello che produce e non deve ricambiare, un beneficio che l’Europa dà ai Paesi in via di sviluppo. Questo ha permesso di sviluppare un’industria del tessile. Molti prodotti Zara e H&M sono stati realizzati in Myanmar, e questo ha creato centinaia di migliaia di posti di lavoro per donne. Uno degli obblighi che ci sentiamo di avere è di preservare questa situazione, anche per aiutare la gente, che altrimenti avrebbe un destino drammatico. Esistono imprese europee anche nel settore del turismo. In cosa consiste il suo ruolo come ambasciatore UE? Lavoro con gli Stati membri UE per elaborare delle posizioni comuni in relazione al Myanmar, in modo che i Paesi europei possano avere un peso maggiore. Materialmente, ho un ufficio con 50 persone, siamo una delle più grandi entità diplomatiche. Abbiamo un ruolo di coordinamento delle posizioni europee che riguarda tutto quello che avviene qui. Ci occupiamo di cooperazione, di questioni commerciali, ma anche della difesa di chi combatte per i diritti umani nel Paese.

    "text": "Mundspülungen töten auch nützliche Mikroben\nExperten der Rutgers University denken um - Natürliches Mittel mit Kräutern wirkt viel selektiver\nMund: Spülungen können der Gesundheit sogar schaden (Foto: Daniel Albany, pixabay.com) |\nNew Brunswick/Aventura (pte001/03.07.2025/06:00)\nForscher der Rutgers University kritisieren die Werbeversprechen von Herstellern von Mundspülungen. Das Abtöten von 99,9 Prozent aller Bakterien schade dem Organismus eher, da neben den schädlichen auch nützliche Erreger eliminiert würden. Ein naturheilkundliches Mundwasser mit pflanzlichen Inhaltsstoffen bekämpfe dagegen gezielt die krankheitserregenden Bakterien und erhalte gleichzeitig die schützenden Mikroben, die für gesunde Zähne und gesundes Zahnfleisch sorgen.\nGegen komplette Ausrottung\n\"Das ist ein Paradigmenwechsel. Wir gehen weg von der vollständigen Ausrottung aller Bakterien und konzentrieren uns nun auf Selektivität. Wir wollen die guten Bakterien erhalten und gleichzeitig die schlechten bekämpfen\", so Forscher Georgios Kotsakis. Die Experten haben das in den USA erhältliche, derzeit aber vergriffene natürliche Mundwasser \"StellaLife VEGA Oral Care Rinse\" im Vergleich zu den konventionellen Produkten Chlorhexidin und Listerine Cool Mint getestet.\nDie Wissenschaftler setzten verschiedene Mundbakterien jedem Präparat aus und beobachteten ihr Wachstum über mehrere Tage hinweg. Die natürliche Mundspülung reduzierte die Populationen schädlicher Bakterien wie Fusobacterium nucleatum und Porphyromonas gingivalis deutlich, während nützliche Arten wie Streptococcus oralis und Veillonella parvula überlebten - aus Sicht der Wissenschaftler eine wichtige Erkenntnis in Sachen Gesundheitsförderung.\nMillionenfache Vernichtung\nChlorhexidin und Listerine eliminierten dagegen sowohl nützliche als auch schädliche Bakterien. Chlorhexidin war besonders aggressiv und reduzierte einige Populationen nützlicher Bakterien um das Millionenfache. \"Diese guten Bakterien haben wichtige Funktionen. Sie töten sogar einige der schädlichen Bakterien ab\", verdeutlicht Kotsakis.\nDie Ergebnisse aus der Petrischale lassen sich allerdings nicht unbedingt auf den Mund mit Zähnen, Speichel und Zucker aus der Nahrung übertragen, heißt es. Die von StellaLife finanzierte Studie hat weder die Bildung von Karies noch Zahnfleischbluten gemessen. Nun sind klinische Studien geplant, die die tatsächliche Wirkung der Präparate aufdecken. \"Antiseptisches Mundwasser kann für die kurzfristige Anwendung gegen bestimmte Munderkrankungen wertvoll sein, sollte aber nicht langfristig verwendet werden\", rät Kotsakis.\nAussender: | pressetext.redaktion |\nAnsprechpartner: | Wolfgang Kempkens |\nTel.: | +43-1-81140-300 |\nE-Mail: |\n|",
