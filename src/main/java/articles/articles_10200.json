    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

El exfuncionario señaló que el actual congresista era una de las personas que le pedía asumir su responsabilidad cuando se registraba una masacre, pero que ahora no se pronuncia ante los hechos de violencia que se registran en el país.\nDe igual forma, Botero insistió que la situación de seguridad en el país es grave, enfatizando en que “asesinan alcaldes y como si nada”.\n“No era usted David Racero, el que me pedía asumir la responsabilidad política cada vez que ocurría un homicidio?? Y ahora si guarda silencio. Asesinan alcaldes y como si nada”\nIván Duque había manifestado que Gustavo Petro “celebraba las masacres” cuando hacía parte de la oposición\nDichos señalamientos van de la mano con unas declaraciones que dio a conocer el expresidente Iván Duque en la tarde del miércoles 27 de diciembre de 2023.\nA través de sus redes sociales, el exmandatario, que señaló al actual Gobierno nacional de brindar ciertas facilidades a las estructuras criminales, recordó que el actual jefe de Estado “celebraba las masacres” cuando hacía parte de la oposición y ahora pretende eludir su responsabilidad.\nY es que en la misma publicación, Duque, que indicó que exmiembros de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Farc) como Iván Márquez, Santrich, El Paisa, Romaña y Gentil Duarte “hicieron conejo” al país, manifestó que el Gobierno nacional les ha ofrecido a los criminales “mantenerlos económicamente”, así como brindarles cierta ayuda con los ceses al fuego.\n“Los que le hicieron conejo a Colombia son: Iván Márquez, Santrich, El Paisa, Romaña, Gentil Duarte, entre otros. Además, Iván Mordisco, el ELN, el Clan del Golfo, entre otras bandas, son los autores de una buena parte de las masacres en Colombia. Lo curioso es que, es el actual Gobierno, el que les da ceses al fuego, beneficios como “gestores de paz”, les ofrece mantenerlos económicamente y les ofrece limpiarles la plata producto del narcotráfico. Celebraban las masacres cuando eran oposición, y ahora quieren tapar el sol con las manos, eludiendo su responsabilidad. Otro mensaje TORPE en lugar de asumir responsabilidades”\nAdemás, los señalamientos tanto de Botero como de Duque se registran pocos días después de que se dio a conocer el asesinato del alcalde de Guachené, Cauca, Élmer Abonía Rodríguez.\nEl funcionario permanecía en una reunión con otros dirigentes de la región que se desarrolló en la vereda Cabito, zona rural al norte de Guachené, cuando hombres armados habrían ingresado al lugar en el que se encontraban para disparar contra ellos.\nTras los hechos, Abonía Rodríguez fue trasladado al hospital de Puerto Tejada, Cauca, donde se confirmó su muerte en la noche del viernes 22 de diciembre de 2023.\nMás Noticias\n[La senadora también instó a la creación de sindicatos, indicando que la tasa de sindicalización en Colombia es de apenas el 5% y que el resultado de ello ha sido la vulneración de los derechos laborales](/colombia/2023/12/28/piedad-cordoba-aprovecho-el-escandalo-de-van-camps-para-impulsar-la-reforma-laboral/)\nPiedad Córdoba aprovechó el escándalo de Van Camp’s para impulsar la reforma laboral\n[Fiel a su costumbre, la actriz de la industria para adultos no se quedó corta a la hora de explicar cómo seduce a sus “presas”](/colombia/2023/12/28/esperanza-gomez-revelo-sus-trucos-para-levantar-hombres/)\nEsperanza Gómez reveló sus trucos para “levantar” hombres\n[El buque, orgullo de la Armada de Colombia, iniciará una misión a partir de marzo de 2024](/colombia/2023/12/28/arc-gloria-llevara-el-mensaje-de-colombia-el-pais-de-la-belleza-en-una-nueva-expedicion-oceanica/)\nARC Gloria llevará el mensaje de “Colombia, el país de la belleza” en una nueva expedición oceánica\n[Desde enero, Gerson Bermont implementará estrategias para garantizar servicios médicos dignos y modernos para los capitalinos](/colombia/2023/12/28/carlos-fernando-galan-empezo-a-mover-sus-fichas-para-la-alcaldia-de-bogota-y-designo-a-su-secretario-de-salud/)\nCarlos Fernando Galán empezó a mover sus fichas para la Alcaldía de Bogotá y designó a su secretario de Salud\n[La vallecaucana, de 32 años, tuvo un destacado paso por el fútbol de Chile, donde dirigió a Deportes Antofagasta](/colombia/2023/12/28/angie-vega-es-la-nueva-entrenadora-de-millonarios-femenino/)\nAngie Vega es la nueva entrenadora de Millonarios femenino\nMÁS NOTICIAS",

Image: Bryan Wiles\nWhen 17-year-old exiled Pole Jas Baraniuk found himself sleeping in a Dundee police cell one night in 1942, it seemed like a happy place compared with the horrors he’d experienced over the previous three years.\nBorn on March 13 1925 in Horodnica, Eastern Poland – which is now 100 miles inside Ukraine – Jas was just 14-years-old when in 1940 he and his family were “ethnically cleansed” by Soviet soldiers.\nFollowing the partition of Poland , the family were forcibly taken on a 21-day journey in cattle wagons to a Siberian labour camp called Zapadnej Uczastek.\nWhen Stalin declared an amnesty so that the Poles could form an army to fight Germany, Jas pretended to be 19-years-old so that he could join the army and get regular food for himself and his mother.\nJas Baraniuk on the McLeans’ doorstep in Dundee during the Second World War. Image: Bryan Wiles For Jas, this was just the start of an adventure that would see him travel through a series of camps in Teheran, Iraq, India, Cape Town and finally to Dundee.\nBut how did he end up in a Dundee police cell just two years before he was dropped into Arnhem?\nSecond World War story led from Poland to Dundee via Siberian labour camps The powerful story of a family ripped from its Polish roots and flung into the frozen wastes of Siberia during the Second World War has been told in a new book.\nThe Chocolate Suitcase, by retired Cambridgeshire physics teacher Bryan Wiles and based on fact-based testimony from his Polish in-laws, is a novel that conducts the reader on a stirring emotional odyssey spanning the globe.\nFor Jas, Dundee was to become a home from home as he undertook parachute training before fighting at the Battle of Arnhem .\nHaving failed to find a billet on his arrival in Scotland, the teenage soldier was initially offered a bed in the cell of a police station – and the police officer on duty, Constable McLean, and his wife then invited him to lodge with them.\n“Jas went to Dundee aged 17 in 1942,” said Bryan, a retired physics teacher, in an interview with The Courier from his home near Peterborough.\nBryan Wiles holding a carved Polish icon. Image: Bryan Wiles “He arrived looking for a billet. He couldn’t find anywhere. He ended up at the police station.\n“The police officer gave him a cell.\n“Jas had been through enormous hardships in Russia through labour camps at the edge of starvation, so a cell seemed like a happy place for him to be.\n“He willingly took this cell, stayed overnight.\n“Meanwhile the policeman went home and spoke to his wife and then when he returned they took Jas in.\n“Mrs McLean became his ‘Scottish mother’ and he referred to her as such for the rest of his life.\n“He stayed with them while doing all his training and was in contact with him ever after.”\nHow did the author find the Second World War story from Poland to Dundee? The story centres on the experiences of Bryan’s wife Rysia’s Polish family.\nBryan recorded their recollections over many years.\nIt is an inspiring tale of love, loss, endurance and ultimate triumph.\nBryan, 68, married Rysia who is the daughter of Bronek and Anna Baranek, about 40 years ago.\nRysia’s parents were on the same Russian escapade as Jas.\nHe got to know the parents and heard bits of the stories over many years.\nBryan Wiles’ Polish parents-in-law Anna and Bronek Baranek. Image: Bryan Wiles It was only in 1990 when Jas, who had emigrated to Canada in 1950, retired and made his first visit back to the UK since the war, that he heard more.\nJas met up with Rysia’s parents and started talking.\nBryan recalls how his “jaw just dropped” when he heard the stories and he was keen to write them down.\n“I began to interview Rysia’s parents thoroughly about it and took the story down,” he said.\n“It was a wonderful thing really because they were quite old.\n“They were talking about life when they were very young so it was quite an uplifting thing to do and gave them a real purpose in life at the end of their lives.”\nHow did the Polish family end up in the Russian labour camps of Siberia? The story tells how Rysia’s father, Bronek Baranek, was a forester living in Eastern Poland with his teenage wife, Anna, when the Second World War broke out in September 1939.\nThey had a young child and Anna was newly pregnant with a second.\nFollowing the German then Russian invasion, Poland was partitioned and their village fell under Russian rule.\nAmongst the often “forgotten” 1.7 million Poles deported to slave labour camps in Siberia by the Russians in 1940 were the Baraneks.\nThe whole family, consisting of Bronek, Anna and baby, Bronek’s mother and his sister, Maria, with her 14-year-old son, Jaś were ethnically cleansed to Siberia.\nAfter being disgorged into the deep Siberian snows at sub-zero temperatures, they found themselves in a barracks, in a pine forest, just north of the Mongolian border.\nThe family was set to work felling trees.\nThey survived two extreme winters, which were so harsh that occasionally birds give up on life mid-flight and fell from the sky.\nFood was always in short supply.\nBronek was brave and resourceful in finding ways to buck the system to get extra rations.\nAnna gave birth to a second son, but lost the first to illness.\nShe suffered from night blindness due to malnutrition.\nMaria came to the rescue, obtaining extra food, in secret, from the friendly Russian camp cook.\nThe second winter claimed Bronek and Maria’s mother.\nBronek was moved from the forest to the village, where he was forced to build log cabins for the exiles.\nThe family moved into one of these.\nThey teamed up with three other families so that they could offer mutual support.\nHow did some of the Poles escape the Siberian labour camps? When Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, Stalin granted an ‘amnesty’ to the Poles, freeing them so that they could form an army to help his war effort.\nWith only about one third of the Poles sent to Siberian labour camps surviving, the family took another appalling journey in a cattle wagon during which Bronek was separated from the group and had to jump on the back of the moving train to maintain contact.\nThey arrived in a poverty-stricken Samarkand, where they were set to work on a collective farm, picking cotton.\nOnce again, Bronek proved to be adaptable and helped the group of four families gain a little extra for their efforts.\nPolish troops praying at an altar in Bethlehem. Image: Bryan Wiles Bronek then offered his services in designing and building a drying shed and so was paid extra for first wetting and then drying the cotton.\nWhen work came to an end, the men were told to enlist into the Polish Army.\nBut it turned out to be a false alarm.\nHomeless, hungry and desperate they got work unloading cargo from trains.\nPetty pilfering helped to keep them alive.\nThey were housed in a disused church, boarded up many years before by the Communists, and used the collection plate as a receptacle for stolen tea released from secret pockets stitched into their trousers.\nThe men joined the army in Kermine.\nWojtek the bear with Polish troops during the Second World War. Image: Bryan Wiles The women suffered hardships, fighting off aggressive thugs and eating grass roots to survive.\nWhen army rations arrived, things improved.\nThe army and the women moved west and crossed the Caspian Sea in paddle steamers.\nThe British fed and clothed them in Pahlevi.\nBronek was now in the Second Polish Corps under General Wladyslaw Anders .\nHe moved from Teheran to Bagdad and then west to Jerusalem and then Cairo.\nHe joined the 22nd Transport Company as a lorry driver and became an instructor to the PESTKI, the Polish Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps.\nHe met Wojtek , the famous ‘Soldier Bear’.\nHe was then shipped to Italy and fought his way up the Italian boot, taking part in the bloodbath of Monte Cassino , a costly victory which ended with the Polish and British flags fluttering above the remains of the hill-top monastery dashed to dust by Allied bombing.\nPolish paratrooper Jas returned to Dundee after the Battle of Arnhem Meanwhile Maria’s son, Jaś, had been sent on his own odyssey from Persia to India, then South Africa and on to Scotland, where he trained to be a paratrooper.\nJas, now 19, fought side by side with the British in the heroic but ill-fated parachute assault centred on the Dutch city of Arnhem.\nHe was involved in heavy fighting for about one week before the long retreat back to England, then returning to his adoptive home in Dundee.\nMaria, Anna and the now toddler, Zdziś found refuge in India in a purpose built camp at Valivade, near Bombay.\nDundee woman Mrs McLean (left) with Polish soldier Jas Baraniuk in Dundee. Image: Bryan Wiles They saw out the war for four years.\nWith Poland taken over by a hostile Communist government in 1946, and with many Poles settling in the UK and elsewhere, the family reunited in England.\nMaria had, by this time, been writing to a Canadian farmer and moved there to marry him.\nJaś married a Polish girl Ola that he met in Germany and they followed his mother to Canada.\nJas and Ola on their wedding day in 1946. Image: Bryan Wiles Jaś and Ola continued writing to the McLeans’ Dundee-born daughter Lillian right up to their passing (Jaś in 2008 and Ola in 2017).\nWhy is the book called The Chocolate Suitcase? Bryan added: “Having known hard times, Jaś bought a large amount of chocolate in Cape Town and kept it as an insurance against possible future hunger.\n“He stored it in a metal suitcase and welded it shut so that he could not access it during his travels.\nFinding better times in Scotland, he opened the suitcase to reveal a congealed mess that he had to throw away.\n“He vowed that whenever he gets chocolate, he will eat it.\nThis story gives rise to the book’s title.”\nThe Chocolate Suitcase by Bryan Wiles The Chocolate Suitcase by Bryan Wiles is available from Amazon at £15.",

Additionally, following its oral presentation at ESMO Asia last December, the Phase 1b data of IBI343 in pancreatic cancer has once again secured an oral presentation at ASCO, further solidifying its potential in this challenging therapeutic area. The maturing PoC data for these innovative candidates has strengthened our confidence in advancing them into pivotal-stage development, with the goal of unlocking their clinical value for global unmet clinical needs. As one of the few biopharmaceutical companies with both the advanced technology platforms and robust pipeline in \"IO+ADC\" areas, Innovent will continue to make breakthroughs in the field of cancer treatment, and is committed to providing physicians and patients with more innovative, effective and safe treatment options.\"\nDetails on the abstracts are listed below:\nOral Presentation\n1.
