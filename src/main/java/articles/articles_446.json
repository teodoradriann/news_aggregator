    "text": "Twenty-seven workers made an improbable escape from a collapsed tunnel in Los Angeles on Wednesday night by climbing over a large mound of loose soil and emerging at the only entrance five miles away without major injury, officials said.\nFour other tunnel workers went inside the industrial tunnel after the collapse to help in the rescue efforts. All 31 workers emerged safely and without significant injuries, said Michael Chee, the spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department said that no one was missing after it had dispatched more than 100 rescue workers to the site in the city’s Wilmington neighborhood, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.\n“Tonight, we were lucky,” interim Fire Department Chief Ronnie Villanueva said at a news conference.\nThe collapse left a 12- to 15-foot pile of loose soil inside a horizontal excavation site in the tunnel, which was seven miles long and had diameter of 18 feet, the Fire Department said in a statement. The tunnel was part of a construction project.\nThe tunnel workers who had been trapped by the debris scrambled over it and met their co-workers who had gone inside to help. The workers were then shuttled in batches on a tunnel vehicle to the entrance, fire officials said.\nTelevision footage from local news broadcasters showed the workers being raised to the ground from the tunnel’s circular entrance inside a metal cage that was hoisted by a crane.\nThe authorities did not immediately say what had caused the collapse. Interim Chief Villanueva said that the workers were being treated for minor injuries.\nThe tunnel was part of a $630 million wastewater management project commissioned by the Sanitation Districts. FlatironDragados, the main contractor of the tunnel, said on its website that the project was expected to be completed in 2027.\nConstruction workers were building a new tunnel to transport treated wastewater to the ocean, replacing two tunnels that had been in operation since the 1930s, Mr. Chee said.\nRobert Ferrante, the chief engineer and general manager of the Sanitation Districts, said that construction would be paused indefinitely while the cause of the collapse was being determined. He said that the collapse had occurred in a section where the ground exerted high pressure on the tunnel while workers were operating a boring machine elsewhere.\nMayor Karen Bass told reporters outside the facility that she had rushed to the site fearing tragedy.\n“We’re all blessed tonight in Los Angeles,” she said.\nJohn Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.\nThe post 27 Workers Make Improbable Escape from Collapsed L.A.

Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992))\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente.

Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes...

Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad...

Many camped out on sidewalks overnight, staking out their spots in the afternoon on New Year’s Eve.\nThe parade was briefly interrupted by about 50 pro-Palestinian protesters carrying a banner demanding a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas. They blocked the route before peacefully dispersing under police orders, said city spokesperson Lisa Derderian.\nMcDonald was set to toss the coin before the 110th Rose Bowl college football game between Alabama and Michigan.",

    "text": "Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri has delivered Sun Princess, the first of two liquefied natural gas (LNG) cruise ships for Princess Cruises.\nFincantieri As disclosed, the cruise ship was delivered at Monfalcone shipyard on February 14. The vessel will remain at the Monfalcone yard for additional technical works, according to Fincantieri.\nSun Princess is the first in Princess Cruises’ Sphere class, which includes a sister-ship to be delivered in 2025. They will each accommodate approximately 4,300 guests and are based on a next-generation platform design. The vessel was launched in March 2023.\nRelated Article Posted: 11 months ago LNG-powered Sun Princess hits the water at Fincantieri Categories: Vessels Posted: 11 months ago At about 178,000 gross tons, Sun Princess is the largest ship ever built in Italy, as well as the first LNG cruise ship ever built by Fincantieri, and the first dual-fuel vessel powered primarily by LNG to enter the Princess fleet.\nFincantieri LNG is considered to be one of the most advanced fuel technologies that is mature, scalable, and commercially viable for the maritime industry. This fuel is also considered among the cleanest fossil fuels because it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and almost totally avoids other air emissions and particulate matter.\nFurthermore, the vessel will be outfitted with two shore power connections, on both the port and starboard side of the vessel, to enable the ship to turn off the engines and connect to local electric power to run all onboard services during day-long calls in various ports.\nTo supply sustainable power and better maneuverability to save fuel, Sun Princess will feature two Azipod propulsions for forward and backward movements and the four largest controllable pitch propellers, known as bow thrusters, on the market for sideways navigation.\nFincantieri Princess Cruises and Fincantieri finalized the contracts for the construction of two next-generation 175,000-ton dual-fueled cruise ships back in 2019. The construction of Sun Princess was kickstarted in September 2021.\nThe keel for the second ship in this class, Star Princess, was laid in December 2023.\nRelated Article Posted: 2 months ago Keel laid for Princess Cruises’ new LNG-fueled ship Categories: Vessels Posted: 2 months ago",

Risteen also serves as the track coach at her alma mater, Concord Christian Academy.\nAs an elite runner, she's side by side with the best in the world.\n\"It's intimidating, to be honest,\" Risteen said. \"You're rubbing shoulders with some of the best marathoners in the world, and so it's a chance to learn from them and respect them.\"\nRisteen hopes to qualify for the Olympic trials in 2028, but her immediate goal is to beat her 2024 Boston Marathon time of 2 hours, 43 minutes and 12 seconds.\n\"I love everything about the Boston Marathon,\" she said. \"It's definitely my favorite marathon. I like that it's close so that my family can all be there, and it just has that unique feel of a small race, even though it's not small at all.\"\nRisteen said she's excited to see more people get into running.\n\"I think running is something that intimidates a lot of people, and I feel like we're starting to shift where more people are trying it and more people are excited about it,\" Risteen said. \"And I think it's something that really anybody can do.
