    "title": "Use Your Tongue to Control a Cursor: See the 'MouthPad' in Action",
    "text": "Using your tongue to control a computer mouse is certainly unconventional. But a San Francisco startup is developing the concept to help people with physical disabilities access today’s PCs and mobile devices.\nOn Friday, Augmental gave its first public demo of the unique mouse, which is called the MouthPad. The Bluetooth device essentially functions as a trackpad built into a mouth piece.\nIn the demo, Augmental software engineer Corbin Halliwill places the device against the roof of his mouth. He then uses his tongue like a finger on a trackpad, which allows him to remotely control a cursor on his iPhone, make clicks, and navigate to Google Maps, hands-free.\nBy using the MouthPad, Halliwill is also able to access the iPhone’s virtual keyboard and begin typing. He then searches for a nearby grocery store in Google Maps .\nAugmental initially debuted the concept in April with a separate video that showed the MouthPad has the potential to help people suffering from quadriplegia access their devices. Although many consumer electronics offer voice commands, it can still be hard to work efficiently on a computer without a way to interface with a traditional mouse and keyboard.\nThe MouthPad aims to fill the gap. The device can run for 5 hours on a single charge, and supports iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nOne challenge will be making the MouthPad fit different mouth shapes. For now, the company has been creating custom molds for customers by mailing them a kit designed to take their dental impressions. \"With your dental scan, we'll manufacture your custom MouthPad, ensuring maximum comfort and reduced weight,” the company said in a FAQ .\nAugmental plans on showing the MouthPad during next week’s CES in Las Vegas. The company’s website has also opened a waitlist for users interested in ordering a unit, although pricing isn't mentioned.",

    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Perfect weather to end the year MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - After a busy year of weather, we are ending it on a quiet note with plenty of sunshine. TODAY A frosty start to the day with temperatures in the upper 20s to low 30s. Temperatures are going to warm up in the mid 50s across our area with mostly sunny skies. We’ll have clouds gradually increasing this afternoon. TONIGHT If you are heading out to the Southern Times Square in Market Common or going to other New Years Eve parties, make sure you bundle up. Temperatures are going to fall in the low 40s with partly cloudy skies. HAPPY NEW YEAR Temperatures will gradually warm up to near normal to start the new year. Highs are going to reach near 60 degrees but this warm weather won’t last for too long. A dry cold front will move on Monday. This will bring in mostly cloudy skies all across the Grand Strand and Pee Dee with cooler weather on Tuesday. LOOKING AHEAD After the dry cold front moves in Monday night, temperatures are going stay below normal for the rest of the week.. The weather is going to stay quiet until midweek. A quick hitting low pressure system will bring scattered showers Wednesday night through Thursday overnight. We’re not expecting that much rain with that system, however there is another storm system we are keeping a close eye on that may lead to soggy Sunday next weekend. Copyright 2023 WMBF.
