    "title": "Emerson Hancock goes toe-to-toe with Jacob deGrom as Mariners edge out Rangers, 3-2",
    "text": "With the likelihood of George Kirby starting the season on the IL increasing with every passing day, each Emerson Hancock start takes on extra importance, especially today’s, where he faced the lefty-heavy, offensive powerhouse of the AL West rival Rangers. Hancock outdueled Rangers ace Jacob deGrom, striking out one more batter, issuing one fewer walk, and giving up one fewer run than the All-Star in the opposite dugout.\nThe one run Hancock gave up was a mistake pitch in an 0-2 count to Corey Seager. Hancock tried to sneak a slider past Seager that wound up in his red zone, and then wound up deposited on the berm in right field. Hancock was frustrated with the miss in location.\n“He’s a good hitter, he’s been doing it a long time, and you can’t throw those pitches there,” said Hancock. “He’s going to make you pay more times than not.”\nOther than that, it was a good outing for Hancock, who topped out at 95 mph on his sinker. He worked in his secondaries starting in the second inning, mixing in his changeup, which got some weak contact and some whiffs, including a swinging strikeout to Adolis García in the third (his other strikeouts were all on the fastball or sinker).\nEmerson Hancock was solid today. Used the sweeper effectively against Texas's lefty-heavy lineup, mixed in the changeup for weak contact and even a swinging strikeout, and had three other strikeouts over five innings on his sinker.\n—[Lookout Landing (@lookoutlanding.bsky.social)][2025-03-19T21:56:09.789Z]\nHancock leaned heavily on his new sweeper as his main secondary against the lefty-heavy Texas lineup.\n“It gives me another option for a first pitch strike, and it gives me another option for a two-strike pitch that you can bury below the zone,” said Hancock.\n“Emerson threw the ball really well,” said manager Dan Wilson. “Kept attacking the zone, got the pitches in there when he needed to, mixed in his off-speed, looked really, really good. Another good outing for him to stack up on the other ones he’s had.”\nAfter Hancock gave up the homer to Seager, the Mariners got that run right back in the bottom of the inning. Jorge Polanco worked a good at-bat against Rangers starter Jacob deGrom, seeing seven pitches. Early in the at-bat, Polanco had an ugly half-swing at a slider; four pitches later, deGrom tried the slider again, but left it middle-in for an answer-back solo home run, continuing Polanco’s solid spring.\nJorge Polanco's solo home run off Jacob deGrom:\n—[Lookout Landing (@lookoutlanding.bsky.social)][2025-03-19T21:35:08.100Z]\nThe Mariners broke the tie in the fourth, small-balling a run against deGrom after Polanco led off with a walk, Cal Raleigh singled on the fastball, Randy Arozarena hit a parachute single on the slider, and Rowdy Tellez popped the first slider he saw into the outfield for a sacrifice fly. It could have been a bigger inning, but Arozarena inexplicably ran to second, where a solid throw from Adolis Garcia nailed him for the out.\nIn the fifth, with deGrom still pitching, J.P. Crawford made sure his day would be deDone:\nJ.P. Crawford demolished this Jacob deGrom changeup: exit velocity 104.3 mph with a distance of 401 feet\n—[Lookout Landing (@lookoutlanding.bsky.social)][2025-03-19T22:00:37.361Z]\nWe’ll go ahead and give J.P. today’s Sun Visor award for that one.\nThe Rangers got a run back in the seventh off Jesse Hahn with some small ball of their own, as García singled, stole second, and moved to third on a Josh Jung single; he scored on a fielder’s choice to make it 3-2. But the Mariners bullpen held; Trent Thornton pitched a 1-2-3 inning, ending on a strikeout of Nick Ahmed; Eduard Bazardo worked around a double and got some defensive help to post a zero; and Shintaro Fujinami also worked a scoreless inning despite walking the leadoff hitter on four sinkers, all 97-98 mph, none of which were anywhere near the zone.\nAfter the walk, though, Fujinami dialed things back in, dropping his velocity but improving his command. He got a harmless flyout on what Statcast called a 91.4 mph sinker, and a groundout on the same pitch before getting the final out of the game on an 85 mph pitch that Statcast labeled a slider but was probably a split. Fujinami is one of the most interesting arms in camp, and the pitching staff has been working with him intently to rein in his command and help harness the talent in his arm.\nOther notes:\n- He got wiped out on a double play to end the inning, but Cal Raleigh also had a nice at-bat right after Polanco’s homer, working an eight-pitch walk.\n- Miles Mastrobuoni continued his strong spring with a single in the third inning off deGrom, but he was also wiped away by a double play. Mariners hitters and GIdeGroms is a pairing I am not looking forward to this season.\n- Like Casey Lawrence the other day, Hancock generates a lot of ground balls and therefore several opportunities for the infield defense. Polanco was a bit wobbly on his first try at third, a routine groundout from Higashioka; his throw pulled Rowdy Tellez off the base at first, but to his credit, the big man showed some good flexibility and was able to stretch back for the force.\nRowdy Tellez cleans up an off-target throw from Polanco at third. The big man is flexible!\n—[Lookout Landing (@lookoutlanding.bsky.social)][2025-03-19T22:08:44.683Z]\nTellez also had a nice snag on a lineout at first. Being able to play first base gives Tellez more versatility, and strengthens his case for making the Opening Day roster even further.\n- No defensive concerns here: in the seventh inning, Miles Mastrobuoni took a hit away from Leody Taveras with a diving grab in center field.\n- Leo Rivas also had a nice defensive play to bail Eduard Bazardo out of some trouble in the eighth after he gave up a double and preserve the Mariners’ lead at 3-2.",

Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: \"This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I'm grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.\" You may also like Read more from UK News National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a \"localised tornado\" in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours' houses \"are an absolute disaster\" with missing roofs and \"squished\" cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: \"Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.\"",

    "text": "Il mondo del volontariato è più povero: è morto a 78 anni Mario Fortini . Originario di Comeana , dalla metà degli anni Settanta si era trasferito a Seano e il suo impegno ha abbracciato tanti settori. Fortini è stato assessore a Carmignano dal 1978 al 1982, poi vicesindaco dal 1987 al 1992 e segretario della sezione del Pci di Seano. Verso la fine degli anni 70 aveva creato, assieme ad altri cittadini, il “ Gruppo ecologico carmignanese “: i primi volontari impegnati in campagne di pulizia dei boschi e nell’antincendio boschivo. E’ stato anche consigliere del cda della Casa di Accoglienza Anziani di Comeana e poi si era dedicato alla Coop Bisenzio-Ombrone di Seano, impegnandosi per lo sviluppo del supermercato. Una volta in pensione si era adoperato per la Cisl, aprendo il primo ufficio di patronato che qualche anno fa si è trasferito in una sede più grande in via Baccheretana. E’ stato anche consigliere della Misericordia di Seano .\nLa notizia della scomparsa di Fortini ha destato molto dispiacere e cordoglio perché Mario era una “presenza fissa“ a Seano, un punto di riferimento per moti. E’ stato colpito da una malattia del sangue improvvisa, diagnosticata pochi mesi fa.\nMario Fortini si può dire era anche un vulcano di idee: anni addietro si era impegnato per far posare delle pietre d’inciampo in ricordo dei deportati carmignanesi e poco tempo fa aveva avanzato la proposta di far dedicare una via o un luogo a Don Umberto Guidotti, missionario di Comeana scomparso nel 2021 e che ha lasciato molti ricordi. Fortini lascia la moglie Alberta, il figlio Walter, la figlia Evelyn e i nipoti. Mario Fortini è esposto alla Misericordia di Carmignano e oggi, alle 15, ci sarà il funerale nella chiesa di Seano.\nM. Serena Quercioli",

    "text": "Enero fue el tercer primer mes del año más cálido desde que hay registros. Febrero, el segundo más caluroso de la historia, marzo igual, abril estuvo ahí ahí, fue el cuarto más cálido de los abriles. Sin embargo, todos l [os meses siguientes (mayo, junio, julio, agosto, septiembre, octubre y noviembre) han alcanzado globalmente temperaturas tan altas que se han convertido en los meses más cálidos desde que hay registros, según ha venido informando ](https://admin.20minutos.es/content/new#) [Copernicus](https://climate.copernicus.eu/press-releases), el Programa de Observación de la Tierra de la Unión Europea. A falta del dato oficial de diciembre, los científicos creen que lejos de toda duda el año 2023 está a punto de convertirse en el más cálido de la historia reciente. \"Normalmente se suele esperar a cerrar el mes de diciembre para hacer balance de todos los datos, aunque es cierto que con la información que tenemos podemos afirmar que, efectivamente, es altamente probable que se consolide como el año más cálido desde que hay registros\", explica a 20minutos Mar Gómez, doctora en Físicas y jefa de Meteorología en [eltiempo.es](https://www.eltiempo.es/). 🧵🗓️El año 2023 ha sido extremadamente cálido y muy seco en España.— AEMET (@AEMET_Esp) En este hilo hacemos un balance de lo más destacado del año en lo que al tiempo y el clima se refiere. 👇 [December 29, 2023] Gómez pone de ejemplo las temperaturas mensuales del último registro oficial, el de noviembre de 2023, que fue el más cálido \"con una temperatura media del aire en superficie de 14,22°C, lo que supone 0,85°C por encima de la media de 1991-2020 para ese mes\". Lo mismo sucedió un mes antes, y con una anomalía similar. Como en junio, julio, agosto o septiembre. \"Con estos datos, no es sorprendente que 2023 vaya a ostentar el primer puesto como año más cálido\", dice. La directora adjunta del Servicio de Cambio Climático de Copernicus, [Samantha Burgess](https://www.europapress.es/sociedad/noticia-copernicus-afirma-bastante-certeza-2023-sera-ano-mas-calido-fecha-20231108035948.html), fue quien anticipó que, [ \"con bastante certeza\", 2023 sería el año más cálido hasta la fecha](), con una temperatura que está 1,43ºC por encima de la era preindustrial. Así pues, el umbral climático de [1,5ºC sobre el nivel preindustrial ](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/SR15_Summary_Volume_spanish.pdf)fijado en el Acuerdo de París de 2015 como máximo a evitar estaría a punto de ser rebasado. Los efectos del incremento de las temperaturas a nivel global ya se están sintiendo. Los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos se están intensificando y exacerbando. \"Las olas de calor son más intensas y severas y se prevé que continúe así e incluso sean más largas, los huracanes serán de mayor categoría y los fenómenos asociados a sequías o inundaciones se acentuaran entre otras muchas cosas. Continuará el retroceso de glaciares y el derretimiento de las regiones polares\", explica la meteoróloga Mar Gómez. El calentamiento global es fruto de los efectos combinados del cambio climático y del fenómeno de [El Niño](https://www.20minutos.es/cinemania/minuteca/el-nino/), que este año se ha sumado a esta difícil situación. Según Gómez, \"una serie de olas de calor mortales y temperaturas récord notables han afectado a varios continentes este año, mientras que el calor del océano sin precedentes cubrió gran parte del mundo\". Ya en verano el clima extremo afectó a muchos millones de personas, y los responsables de Copernicus señalaron que, lamentablemente, \"la dura realidad del cambio climático\" hace que la necesidad de reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero sea más urgente que nunca. \"La acción climática no es un lujo sino una obligación\", advirtieron. Mar Gómez también defiende que debemos preocuparnos y tomar medidas \"urgentes\" sobre todo a nivel gubernamental. \"Hay que eliminar el uso de combustibles fósiles y cambiar nuestro estilo de vida, que pasa por un cambio en la energía (a renovables), en la forma de consumir, en el transporte...\". Sequía pertinaz y muy costosa Mientras tanto, en España la sequía sigue instalada y para quedarse. Las reservas de agua para consumo siguen por debajo del nivel del año pasado (36,6%), y lejos del nivel medio de la última década (48,9%).
