    "text": "Paddy McNair and Daniel Ballard on target as Northern Ireland beat Luxembourg Michael O’Neill’s side dominated their first match at Windsor Park in 10 months. Early strikes from Paddy McNair and Daniel Ballard earned Northern Ireland a 2-0 victory over Luxembourg as they got their latest Nations League campaign off to a winning start. With both goals coming in the opening 17 minutes, the only disappointment was that Michael O’Neill’s side did not add to their tally as they dominated their first match at Windsor Park in 10 months. It was only a second win in 17 tries for Northern Ireland in the short history of this competition, but builds on the momentum of recent improved performances as they look to get themselves out of League C. https://x.com/itvfootball/status/1831772504332829044 Northern Ireland wasted no time in asserting themselves, with Shea Charles threatening just 70 seconds in from a corner. Dion Charles then hit a bouncing shot over the bar after Luxembourg failed to clear a free-kick, and Northern Ireland’s early pressure paid off when they took the lead with 11 minutes gone Ciaron Brown sent in a long throw from the right, Ballard fought for a flick-on at the near post and the ball came to McNair near the penalty spot to power a shot into the left-hand corner of the net, scoring his seventh Northern Ireland goal on the night of his 70th cap. Having taken the early lead, O’Neill’s men did not sit back. Bradley won a scrap with Dirk Carlson for the ball down the right and was brought down right on the edge of the box. George Saville hit the free-kick low towards the near post, with Ballard arriving on cue to turn the ball in and score his first Windsor Park goal. It was not until moments before the break that Northern Ireland seriously threatened again but there was no surprise that it was the excellent Bradley who jinked his way into the box before Christopher Martins scrambled the ball away for a corner as the Liverpool man prepared to shoot. From the resulting corner the ball came out to the night’s captain, Trai Hume, on the edge of the box, but his shot from distance sailed narrowly wide. Either way, the the whistle had already blown for a foul in the build-up by Ballard, who went into the book. O’Neill freshened up the front line at the break with Josh Magennis earning his 80th cap, replacing Dion Charles, and seconds after the restart they were on the attack again with Isaac Price’s volley narrowly wide from Hume’s cross. After Luxembourg clumsily conceded possession, Price’s low cross was just in front of Magennis, who might have been expected to slide in at the far post. Moments later, Hume hooked a shot wide from the edge of the box. O’Neill then turned to Jamal Lewis, who only flew into Belfast on Wednesday after travelling to Brazil to seal his loan move from Newcastle to Sao Paulo, with the 26-year-old replacing Callum Marshall. Bradley had a superb chance to add a third in the 66th minute after breaking the offside trap to latch on to Hume’s pass forward, but when clean through on goal he dragged his shot wide of the target. At the other end, Bailey Peacock-Farrell kept out Gerson Rodrigues’ near-post header from Mathias Olesen’s corner. That was a rare moment of concern at the back but there was another self-inflicted one in the 77th minute when Peacock-Farrell and McNair collided going for the same ball on the edge of the box, grateful to see Olesen shoot wide of the open goal. But the night ended with Northern Ireland on top, and substitute Ross McCausland was denied a first international goal in stoppage time as Luxembourg goalkeeper Anthony Moris pushed his shot wide.",

    "text": "Transición Ecológica archiva el expediente del proyecto solar que afectaba a 13 términos municipales de Castellón y recibió una lluvia de informes contrarios de ayuntamientos y Generalitat Adiós al Proyecto Magda . El Ministerio de Transición Ecológica ha dado carpetazo definitivo al plan de la promotora francesa Akuo para construir una megaplanta fotovoltaica con base en la localidad de Les Coves de Vinromà, que afectaba a trece términos municipales de Castellón y contaba con un fuerte rechazo vecinal. La iniciativa comenzó su andadura administrativa en 2020. La promotora gala, especializada en instalaciones de renovables, proyectó un parque solar inicial de 472 hectáreas y una kilométrica nueva red de evacuación y cuatro subestaciones que implicaba la necesidad de llegar a acuerdos o expropiar suelos de propietarios de la zona que se negaban en redondo a la puesta en marcha, a ceder sus terrenos o veían en riesgo sus negocios agropecuarios, en un conflicto muy similar al que retrató la cineasta catalana Carla Simón en la película Alcarràs . Akuo presentó finalmente hace cuatro años una solicitud de autorización para un parque fotovoltaico de 127,8 MW de potencia instalada ante el Ministerio de Transición Ecológica . La Dirección General de Política Energética aprobó una declaración de impacto ambiental (DIA) positiva con algunos condicionantes. Sin embargo, a la hora de evacuar consultas a las administraciones locales y autonómica al someter el expediente a información pública, recibió una lluvia de informes desfavorables de todos los ayuntamientos implicados: Les Coves de Vinromà, Vilanova d’Alcolea, La Torre d’en Doménec, Benlloc, Alcalà de Xivert, Torreblanca, La Vall d’Alba, Cabanes, Vilafamés, Sant Joan de Moró, Borriol, Castelló de la Plana y Almassora. También alegaron en contra por razones medioambientales, paisajísticas o de conservación arqueológica varios departamentos de la Generalitat valenciana y la Diputación de Castellón. El 'Alcarràs' valenciano que explica por qué hay rechazo a las fotovoltaicas en la España rural En ese contexto de fuerte rechazo político y social, la empresa francesa, accionista única de la sociedad limitada Tregmul Trade, que tramitaba las solicitudes, optó el pasado mes de junio por comparecer ante la Dirección General de Política Energética y Minas del Ministerio que dirige de forma transitoria Teresa Ribera (tiene que tomar posesión en breve de su nuevo cargo de vicepresidenta de la Comisión Europea ) para presentar una solicitud de desistimiento de la autorización administrativa. Entre los motivos alegados para renuncia al proyecto, Akuo expuso el de la inviabilidad económica del plan en los términos que establece la DIA, el desistimiento de los proyectos de otros promotores con los que pretendía compartir la infraestructura de evacuación hasta la red de transporte y a las alegaciones recibidas durante el trámite de información pública. Así se explica en la resolución firmada por director general de Política Energética, Manuel García Hernández, a la que tuvo acceso El Confidencial. En ella, acepta el desistimiento y archiva definitivamente el expediente. Akuo ha presentado un escrito en el que solicita a la Caja General de Depósitos del Ministerio de Economía, Comercio y Empresa orden de cancelación y devolución a Tregmul Trade de la garantía depositada por el permiso del que disponía de acceso y conexión por parte de Red Eléctrica Española.

    "text": "After losing strength and becoming a tropical storm, Kong-rey was expected to impact Shanghai and neighbouring regions along China's eastern coastline with severe rainfall and strong winds on Friday.The system moved across Taiwan as a typhoon on Thursday, causing tree falls and triggering landslides that blocked roads and damaged residential structures. The disaster resulted in two fatalities and left more than 500 individuals injured.Officials in Taiwan's Hualien province confirmed they had established contact with two Czech tourists previously considered missing. The Central News Agency reported the pair had set up camp in Taroko National Park and were found unharmed.Kong-rey, bearing a Cambodian-origin name, was tracking northeastward along China's coast. The National Meteorological Center indicated it could strike Zhejiang province Friday afternoon before moving back toward the ocean.The weather system was predicted to affect Shanghai and areas within Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, potentially delivering rainfall amounts between 10 to 12 centimeters (4 to 5 inches) in certain locations.Maritime authorities in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces halted several ferry services in preparation for the approaching storm.In Taiwan's capital Taipei, light precipitation continued Friday morning, while most educational institutions and offices resumed operations, with public services largely returning to normal.The weather system had previously moved north of the Philippines earlier in the week, leading to new evacuations shortly after Tropical Storm Trami caused 145 fatalities the week before.The intense precipitation partially attributed to Trami claimed seven lives in China's Hainan province, a popular tourist destination known for its coastal attractions, as the storm passed near the southern region.",

    "text": "Man who died trying to help stranger ‘will be remembered for helping others’ Chris Marriott, 46, died when a car ploughed into a crowd on a Sheffield street as he was providing first-aid to an injured woman. A father-of-two who died when a car ploughed into a crowd of people as he was trying to assist a stranger will be remembered for helping others, a church group has said. Chris Marriott, 46, was walking in Sheffield with his wife and two young sons, aged eight and six, when he went to the aid of a woman he spotted lying unconscious in the street, police have said. As Mr Marriott was providing first aid to the woman, a car collided with them both and others. Officers said a call had been made reporting a violent disturbance on College Close, in the Burngreave area of the city, and two men have been arrested in connection with the incident. Tributes have mounted for Mr Marriott, who has been described as a “good Samaritan” by police and was a much-loved member of his church. He worked for the charity Community Money Advice (CMA), helped set up and run the Jubilee Food Bank in Sheffield and was a member of City Church, in the city. The church group ChristCentral, which includes City Church, said in a statement that everyone was “deeply shocked” by Mr Marriott’s death. It said: “Chris died doing what so many will remember him for, helping others. “He had stopped to help an unconscious woman lying in the street and as he was providing first aid, a car collided with Chris, the woman and others. “Our thoughts and prayers are obviously with his wife, and their two young sons. “This is an unbelievably awful situation and we are heartbroken for the family. “Please pray for them, for Chris’ wider family and friends, and for City Church Sheffield as they try to process this loss.” According to the CMA website, Mr Marriott was the charity’s IT manager but had previously worked as a debt adviser in a CMA-affiliated debt advice centre in South Yorkshire. It said that he previously worked for a large group of museums as their head of operations & commercial development, and “also spent some time working for his local church, overseeing a number of community-based projects”. South Yorkshire Police confirmed that Mr Marriott was out for a post-Christmas walk with his family when he went to the aid of the woman just after 2pm on Wednesday. It is believed the woman had been involved in an altercation and several other people suffered injuries during the incident, including an off-duty midwife who had also stopped to help. A police spokeswoman said the woman Mr Marriott was helping remains in hospital in a life-threatening condition. She said the off-duty midwife suffered minor injuries, another man received serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening and four further people, three women and a man, suffered minor injuries. A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 55-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Both remained in custody on Friday morning. Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Knowles said: “This is an utterly heartbreaking case in which a Good Samaritan, who had stepped in to help a stranger in their time of need, has lost his life. “Chris leaves behind a loving family including his devastated wife and two young sons. “We are absolutely determined to secure justice for Chris and his loved ones following this horrific tragedy.” Burngreave residents said the incident happened outside a house at the junction of College Close and College Court, two quiet cul-de-sacs of modern houses near Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital. Neighbours said the altercation was related to some kind of dispute between two families relating to a wedding. Mr Knowles said: “Increased patrols will continue in the area in the coming days and local people will continue to see officers carrying out inquiries, including going house to house to gather witness statements. “There are people in that community who hold information which is vital to our investigation and have not yet given statements. “I want to be able to get to the bottom of what happened for Chris and his family. “I need those people with information to do the right thing.” Tarek Nayli, 49, said he came out of his nearby home to see fighting in the street, a number of injured people and neighbours telling him there were others trapped under a car. Mr Nayli said: “I heard a lot of sound, a lot of voices, a lot of shouting. “When I came out, I found people all gathering around and people fighting. “One guy had a lot of blood on his face.” Mr Nayli said: “The whole neighbourhood was out.” He said: “They said there were people underneath the car and when the police came they managed to get them out. “When the police came, they flipped the car over and they’ve taken two people out.” He said: “It was very, very sad and also very upsetting and I couldn’t believe it. “All of a sudden you find people dead and a very big crime. “This is a disaster.”",

    "text": "The newest volunteers for the Volunteer Advocates for Seniors and Incapacitated Adults were sworn in to help those who can no longer manage their own affairs. Franciscan Health and the Lake County Courts partners to provide the service to seniors and the incapacitated who are unable to represent themselves in legal matters. Funded by the Indiana Supreme Court, Legacy Foundation, Inc. and other sources, it’s provided elder law and guardianship services to the community in Lake County for 22 years. Lake Superior Court Probate Commissioner Ben Ballou swore in three new VASIA volunteers. LaFayette Boone of Crown Point, Steven Bowling of Portage and Dr. Celeste McGill of Chicago will advocate for elderly and incapacitates adults, serving as their court-appointed agents. “You’re joining a family of very talented and special people,” VASIA Director LaVonne Jarrett said. People are also reading… The volunteers are screened and required to do 40 hours of initial training and then 12 hours of continuing education. “What you’re doing is so important to our community,” Ballou said. “You’re a voice for the voiceless. You advocate for people who don’t have anyone to advocate for them. From the court’s perspective, you’re filling a huge void for us.” The advocates work as guardians on just one case at a time so it has their full attention and they don’t get overextended. “You will see the dying,” VASIA Volunteer Coordinator Francisca Mendoza said during the swearing-in ceremony. “You will see the poor and you’ll see the unwanted, by society and their families, but you will become an extension of the family. They’ll look forward to your visits.” Bowling is a barber who cuts nursing home residents’ hair for free. “To get a blessing, you’ve got to be a blessing,” Bowling said. “I just like to make others happy.” Boone is a nurse and Navy veteran who said she likes to be of service. McGill is a professor at the City Colleges of Chicago who previously worked as a social worker. “I don’t think anyone’s socio-economic status should determine the kind of care, services and support they need and deserve,” McGill said. Lake Superior Court Judge Bruce Parent told the volunteers they are “doing God’s work.” “God sees all and His light is shining upon you all,” Parent said. “We very much appreciate you.” For more information, visit www.franciscanhealth.org/VASIA .
