    "title": "Sathya Kannan proposes AI neural network frameworks to cut global CO₂ emissions in her new research - Digital Journal",
    "text": "Photo courtesy of Sathya Kannan Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.\nSustainability advocate and AI engineer Sathya Kannan has recently unveiled a framework that claims to be capable of reducing global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions leveraging AI neural networks . In her latest peer-reviewed research, Kannan outlines how strategic deployment of intelligent algorithms can reduce environmental impact and enhance resource utilization across industries.\nPublished in the International Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Learning, Kannan’s research paper presents an interesting discussion on harnessing deep learning models for driving sustainability initiatives across industries, from energy and agriculture to manufacturing and waste management.\nResearch Highlights\nEnvironmental Impact Forecasting: Kannan’s study introduces artificial neural networks (ANNs) that can be used during the product design stage for carrying out virtual environmental assessments. Findings of these assessments can help engineers make greener design choices by minimizing carbon footprints from the outset. In addition to improving sustainability metrics, this model of early-stage intervention also streamlines compliance and environment protection related regulatory frameworks. Quantifiable Reductions: Through her research, Kannan has estimated that AI implementation can reduce annual carbon emissions by an impressive 2%. When applied at scale, 0.4 to 0.6 million metric tons of CO₂ can be potentially counterbalanced per year. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA): In her framework, Kannan has integrated Industry 4.0 enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems into AI for the optimization and simulation of environmental impacts throughout the lifecycle of a product. This includes thoroughly tracking material efficiency, waste output, emissions, and energy consumptions. Real-World Applications: In real-world scenarios, the feasibility and efficiency of these AI models is underscored by waste-to-energy systems, energy management case studies, and smart water infrastructure. As an example, major facilities have used AI-enhanced predictive models to reduce consumption of electricity by up to 15%. Similarly, smart cities have minimized landfill dependencies and improved recycling rates by using AI-assisted waste sorting systems. A globally sustainable AI-model One of the key aspects of Kannan’s research is its dual focus on ethical deployment and technological innovation. She has addressed concerns related to ecological footprint of AI by advocating for model training practices that are conscious of public resource and energy consumption.\n“It is important to understand that the immense potential of AI must not be fulfilled at the cost of sustainability,” Kannan emphasized. “To make this possible, we need to build frameworks that are both high-performing and low-impact.”\nHer study encourages the creation of intermediate neural network models trained from large existing models, which can significantly reduce the environmental strain and computational load associated with deep learning.\nHer work also emphasizes on adaptability and scalability across different socio-economic contexts. In her research paper, Kannan has provided tailored recommendations for developing as well as developed countries by recognizing the unique capabilities and challenges they face while deploying advanced technology.\nFor developed countries, Kannan focuses on AI integration for optimization of energy usage, minimizing energy costs, and improving lifecycle planning. On the other hand, for least developed and developing nations, her research outlines policy-driven AI frameworks for waste reduction, resource efficiency, and infrastructure planning.\nKannan’s research also discusses a wide spectrum of applications, as summarized here.\nEnergy: Smart AI-algorithms can precisely forecast the demand for electricity, which helps reduce dependency on fossil fuels and enables better load distribution. Agriculture: AI models can predict soil conditions and forecast irrigation needs, which is critical to optimization of water usage and sustainable crop yields. Waste Management: Contaminated and non-contaminated waste materials can be sorted, classified, and tracked leveraging machine learning systems, which can help promote circular economy practices. Manufacturing: Through process analytics and predictive maintenance, neural networks can reduce wastage and optimize equipment performance. Bridging the gap between research and implementation Kannan has incorporated Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in her framework to ensure its practical impact. Based on real-time data, this will help organizations and governments choose sustainable strategies. This model allows stakeholders to reflect on competing factors such as social equity, environmental benefits, and cost involved in designing adaptive and actionable strategies.\nIn her research, Kannan has also emphasized on building institutional capacity for the adoption of AI. This includes open access to data sets, development of governance frameworks, and workforce training to ensure equitable transparent deployment of AI. By offering a roadmap that aligns research activities with operational reality, she has created template for regulatory compliance pathways and public-private partnerships.\n“The path to achieving net-zero emissions can be a complicated one,” she explained. “It demands constant recalibration based on economic, social, and environmental inputs. AI makes it possible for us to accomplish this complex task intelligently, dynamically, and inclusively.”\nLooking ahead Kannan’s future plan is to pilot real-time AI deployments in rural electrification, energy optimization, and municipal water conservation by collaborating with governments. She will also present the findings of her research in renowned forums and conferences such as COP29, World Resources Forum, AI for Good Global Summit, and NeurIPS.\n“Our mission should be to harness AI not just for advancing industry, but to safeguard our planet. I hope that the findings of this research can be a step toward that shared future.”",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "INDOZONE.ID – Galileo Galilei, an Italian scientist who lived from 1564 to 1642, is known as the father of modern astronomy. He is also credited as the inventor of the\nworld’s first thermometer that worked, although it was not very accurate.\nGalileo is known as a pioneer in the use of experimental scientific methods. Apart from that, it turns out that Galileo also accidentally discovered a very surprising new planet.\nGalileo Galilei had successfully observed Neptune on December 28, 1612 and January 27, 1613. However, on both occasions, Galileo mistook the Neptune he saw for a star.\nIn history it is recorded that he believed that what he saw was only a blue star, so he did not get recognition for his discovery of the planet Neptune.\nAlso Read: Get to know Renewable Energy, Supporting Environmentally Friendly Future\nTechnology\nGalileo Galilei. (Wikimedia Commons)\nGalileo’s notes, based on observations he made, show that the positions of nearby stars are not in modern catalog records.\nThis became the basis for Physicist David Jamieson from the University of Melbourne to declare the discovery of a new planet by Galileo,\n“It has been known for the last few decades that this unknown star is actually the planet Neptune,” said David Jamieson as quoted by Space.com, Thursday (28/12/2023).\n“Computer simulations demonstrated the accuracy of his observations, revealing that Neptune should look like a faint star, almost exactly at the location where Galileo observed it,” he continued.\nBased on Jamieson’s notes in an article published in Australian Physics, showed that he saw Neptune moving as it approached a star during his observations on January 28, 1613. However, Galileo did not follow up on the results of his observations.\nAlso read: Take a peek at Mark Zuckerberg’s elite futuristic bunker in Hawaii, make preparations for the end of the\nworld\n“If Galileo had used his observations to suggest the discovery of a new planet, it would have been the first discovery of a new planet by mankind since ancient times, and this would have never happened before in recorded history,” Jamieson said on the University\nWorld News page. .\n2023-12-28 06:20:00\n#December #Galileo #Galilei #accidentally #discovered #planet #Neptune",

    "text": "By Wwj Newsroom ,\n3 hours ago\nLANSING (WWJ) -- There are some new big cats in Michigan's capital.\nThe Potter Park Zoo has welcomed two lynx brothers from the Pittsburgh Zoo, and now they're now on view for visitors.\n\"They're pretty close to the entrance to the zoo,\" said Zookeeper Carolyn Schulte. \"They're in an exhibit that previously housed our ravens, and so they are settling in quite well. We've been watching them for about the last two weeks or so get comfortable in their exhibit and start to explore a bit more.\"\nSchulte said \"Ragnar\" and \"Rollo\" each weigh about 35 lbs., and have distinct personalities.\n\"Ragnar is a little more bold, a little more curious and comfortable with new situations,\" Schulte told told WWJ's Beth Fisher. \"He kind of takes things head on. So, he's been the one out exploring quite a bit more yesterday. I saw him resting in the shade when there are still visitors walking by.\"\n\"Our other male, Rollo, has really seemed to enjoy being in the behind-the- scenes area.\"\nSchulte said lynx are native to Canada.\nAnd while they are near-threatened in some areas, a few can be found in the wilds of our state.\n\"There are certain parts of their range where they're much more threatened or endangered, due to things like habitat loss, conflict with humans and logging,\" Schulte explained. \"So, their historic range use to be a little bit further south than it is currently. But even in Michigan we do have Canadian lynx in the Upper Peninsula.\"\nSchulte said she's not aware of the Potter Park Zoo ever having lynx before.\nApril and through Labor Day, the Potter Park Zoo is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
