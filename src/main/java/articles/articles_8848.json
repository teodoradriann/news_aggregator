    "text": "'Jesus is born in the rubble': Palestinian Christians redefine Christmas under Israeli war As cities around the world celebrate Christmas, Palestinian Christians in the homeland of the Nativity rediscover the meaning of Christmas, amidst Israeli war. Closed shops, quiet streets and very few people walking by rapidly make an unusual Christmas-time evening [in Bethlehem’s old town](https://www.newarab.com/news/bethlehem-marks-christmas-vigil-war-rages-gaza). The Manger Square, in front of the Nativity church, remains empty of people most of the time, and without the yearly, characteristic December Christmas tree. Even foreign pilgrims are absent. The atmosphere in Bethlehem looks anything but like a December afternoon in the city of the Nativity, while cities around the world prepare to celebrate the Bethlehemite birth. \"The atmosphere itself among Palestinians, especially Christians, is visibly tense, especially as the end of December approaches, and the discussion becomes more frequent, in homes, on social media, and in churches: What does it mean to commemorate Christmas without celebrating?\" Although commemorated, [Christmas will not be celebrated this year in Palestine](https://www.newarab.com/news/palestinian-christians-cancel-christmas-plans-amid-gaza-war). The country's tiny Christian community, the world’s oldest, has decided to have a reserved, modest commemoration of Jesus’s birth, as a reaction to [the current Israeli war on Gaza](https://www.newarab.com/tag/gaza-war-2023). The war has so far killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians, including more than 8,000 children, many of whom were newborns. In mid-November, the council of Christian churches’ bishops in the Holy Land issued a statement, calling their faithful to avoid unnecessary celebrations and limit Christmas festivities to religious services. The statement also encouraged priests and pastors to “concentrate on the spiritual meaning of Christmas and dedicate our thoughts to our brothers and sisters in Gaza”. Simultaneously, the municipalities of Bethlehem and Ramallah, home to the main [Christian populations in the West Bank](https://www.newarab.com/news/christmas-reborn-bethlehem-after-pandemic-years) and the centres of Christmas’ yearly celebrations, issued separate statements jointly with the cities’ churches, announcing the cancellation of all Christmas celebrations this year. Traditionally, Christmas is a national event in Palestine. Its commemoration includes the traditional [procession in Bethlehem](https://www.newarab.com/news/thousands-mark-christmas-west-bank-town-bethlehem) on December 24, accompanying Jerusalem’s patriarch’s entry to the Nativity grotto. Scout bands from across the country, including Palestinian bands from within Israel’s boundaries parade through Star Street, where according to tradition, wise men from the East followed the star to the grotto, and then through the Manger Square. [Palestinian families of all faiths assist](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-bans-gazas-christians-bethlehem-celebrations), making it a popular celebration. [This same tradition is repeated on January 6](https://www.newarab.com/features/palestines-many-christmases-faces-christian-diversity), although in a smaller size, for Christmas Eve according to the eastern ‘Julian’ calendar. In Ramallah, the occasion takes a more secular-modern, less religious, less folkloric tone. The central piece of [celebrations in the city](https://www.newarab.com/features/palestinians-prepare-celebrate-christmas-amidst-covid-19) is the lighting of the Christmas tree in the Yasser Arafat Square, accompanied by carol concerts and other artistic presentations. The celebration is one of the city’s biggest events every year, attended by thousands. Political, civil and religious Christian and Muslim leaders take the stage in an almost ritualistic manner and offer speeches, always with a political message of national unity. However, the exceptional aspect of this year’s Christmas is far from being limited to the absence of celebrational rituals, traditions or decorations. The atmosphere itself among Palestinians, especially Christians, is visibly tense, especially as the end of December approaches, and the discussion becomes more frequent, in homes, on social media, and in churches: What does it mean to commemorate [Christmas without celebrating](https://www.newarab.com/features/palestinian-christians-say-cancel-christmas)? In a narrow street of Bethlehem, the Dar Annadwa International Centre has its doors open, in the quiet, almost empty old town. The centre is one of the most important hubs of Christian cultural and social life in Palestine. It was in Dar Annadwa, in 2009, that several civil and religious Palestinian Christian leaders and figures announced [the ‘Kairos’ document](https://www.newarab.com/news/christian-palestinian-group-lambasts-germany-anti-bds-motion), which was at the time intended to represent a unified call by Palestinian Christians to the world, to stand for Palestinian rights. But this evening, it is not bishops or public figures who have come to Dar Annadwa, but young people. People, all in their twenties, continue to arrive from different towns of Bethlehem, from Ramallah, Nablus and Jerusalem, to attend a talking event about a provocative question: Where is God? Speaking at the stage is Reverend Munther Ishaq, Dar Annadwa’s director and the pastor for the Lutheran evangelical church of Bethlehem. He answers questions by the youth, written on paper strips, all concerning the war in Gaza: Why would God allow this to happen, Why doesn’t he stop it, What should we do as Christians, and particularly repeated, How can Netanyahu [quote our own bible to justify our own genocide](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/erase-gaza-how-genocidal-rhetoric-normalised-israel)? Reverend Munther answers in length, essentially stating the basic tenets of [the Palestinian contextual theology](https://www.academia.edu/5782901/CONTEXTUAL_THEOLOGICAL_PRAXIS_AS_RESISTANCE_PALESTINIAN_CHRISTIAN_PEACE-BUILDING_IN_THE_OCCUPIED_WEST_BANK): The bible is to be understood in its historical context, it doesn’t talk about today’s conflict. It is part of Palestine’s heritage and therefore belongs to Palestine’s Christians, as Christians, and as Palestinians. But most importantly, Reverend Munther repeats one central message: In its context, the birth of Jesus happened under occupation and in the middle of a massacre of Bethlehem’s children; there is nothing more Palestinian than Christmas, in this year's context Earlier in November, Reverend Munther’s church became a world celebrity, after [photos of its Nativity scene](https://www.newarab.com/news/bethlehem-church-nativity-scene-symbolises-gaza-genocide) went viral on social media. Baby Jesus was placed not on a bed of straw, but in the middle of debris, echoing the images of Palestinian babies rescued after Israeli bombardment in Gaza, on October 7. Bethlehem’s debris Nativity scene became such a hit that news channels reported it around the world. Even the US Vice-president Kamala Harris was publicly reminded that “in Bethlehem baby Jesus is in the rubble”, [by a Democrat representative, while confronting her](https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-ceasefire-b2463503.html) over the White House’s refusal of a ceasefire in Gaza, during a Christmas dinner speech at her house in Washington DC. “I did not expect the Nativity scene to become such an international sensation, it wasn’t meant to,” Revered Munther tells The New Arab at the Lutheran school in Beit Sahour, a town of Bethlehem’s conglomeration and the West Bank’s largest Christian community. “It was meant to send a message to our community and the rest of our people, here in Palestine,” explains Munther. “The message is that God suffers with the oppressed, he solidarises with the human suffering and shares it, that God this year is there, in Gaza, under the rubble [and in the hospitals without electricity](https://www.newarab.com/news/why-israel-attacking-hospitals-gaza),\" he stresses. Munther Ishaq admits that “the concerns of this Christmas are far deeper than the absence of celebrations, as the questions of the youth at the event showed”. He takes a heavy breath and continues in a lower tone: “The biggest concern is about the entire future in this country, that the occupation state has [unleashed a war against Palestinians’ existence](https://www.newarab.com/news/what-genocide-and-israel-guilty-it-gaza) without any opposition from the rest of the world, and that existence includes us, Palestinian Christians. “The message is that God suffers with the oppressed, he solidarises with the human suffering and shares it, that God this year is there, in Gaza, under the rubble and in the hospitals without electricity” - Reverend Munther Ishaq, Lutheran Pastor of Bethlehem “This is why we don’t see the cancellation of celebrations as a form of solidarity”, points out Munther. “We can’t be in solidarity with Palestine, because we are part of Palestine, part of its cause and its suffering,” he remarks. [This belonging of Palestine’s Christians to the Palestinian cause](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/role-palestinian-christians-shaping-palestine) “disturbs some of the Christians in the West, especially in the US”, according to Munther, who thinks that, “Many US and European churches seem to discover the existence of Palestinian Christians every time the conflict erupts, and seem to be surprised every time to learn where we stand from it, [because our existence challenges their false idea](https://www.newarab.com/news/gazas-palestinian-christians-who-are-they) that this is a conflict between a ‘Judeo-Christian’ West, whatever that means, and Islam.” An idea that was challenged also by Israel itself, several times since the beginning of the current war. On October 19, [Israeli warplanes bombed Gaza’s Greek-Orthodox Saint Porphyrius church](https://www.newarab.com/news/heres-what-we-know-about-israels-strike-gaza-church), in Gaza’s old city. The church, thought to be one of the oldest in the world, was housing families who had fled Israeli bombs. The strike killed 19 Palestinians. On December 20, [an Israeli army sniper killed a middle-aged Palestinian Christian woman and her mother](https://www.newarab.com/news/mother-daughter-killed-israel-gaza-church-grounds) as they moved from [the Holy Family Catholic church](https://www.newarab.com/news/who-are-catholics-gaza) where they took refuge, to the charity sister's convent, in the church’s compound. Gaza’s very small, native and centuries-old Christian community is facing [the same fate as the rest of the Strip’s population](https://www.newarab.com/video/pope-francis-calls-israeli-attacks-gaza-church-terrorism). In Ramallah, the centre of Palestinian politics, Christians have a more visible intervention in politics and civil society. Shortly after the beginning of the war in early October. The local civil society mobilised to help [Gazan workers whom Israel had arrested and expelled to the West Bank](https://www.newarab.com/news/thousands-gaza-workers-expelled-west-bank-israel). Christians were at the centre of this mobilisation, hosting workers from Gaza in the city’s Christian scout’s troupe headquarters. The Greek Catholic parish, among others, became a centre for volunteers to gather aid to the workers, and sort it in individual packages. “This was the least we could do at the time, but now, as Christmas is at hand, we can’t even gather donations for the people in Gaza, as the occupation has imposed a total blockade on the Strip,” Hind Shraydeh, a Palestinian Christian mother, journalist, activist and resident of Ramallah, tells The New Arab. This blockade is killing innocent people in Gaza, and it is also preventing us, as Palestinian Christians from practising our faith by coming to their aid,” she stresses. “ [It doesn’t seem that Christians around the world realise this situation](https://www.newarab.com/opinion/israeli-ethnic-cleansing-palestine-targets-christians-too),” she exclaims. In early December, as Palestinian churches and cities cancelled celebrations, Israeli forces began to move south of the Gaza Strip, bombing everything in their way, following the collapse of a week-long, fragile truce. As the scores of Palestinian victims spiked, exceeding 16,000, [US President Biden turned on the lights for the Christmas tree at the White House](https://wtop.com/lifestyle/2023/12/biden-gets-a-chance-to-bring-holiday-spirit-to-washington-by-lighting-the-national-christmas-tree/). “Baby Jesus is alone in the rubble of the grotto,” [wrote Hind Shraydeh on her Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hind.shraydeh/posts/6891840264205142). “Meanwhile, in a parallel and very cruel world, TV screens throw at us images of the US president lighting the Christmas tree near the White House,” her message read. “At home, we are not putting up a Christmas tree, and I explained to my three children the reason why we didn’t make a tree this year,” explains Hind. “I believe this is an occasion to teach children that Christmas is not about gifts and food, but it’s about feeling with the poor, the weak, the oppressed, especially when they are our people,” she explains, while placing her cup of coffee down on the table and taking a long lookout, at the main street of Ramallah, with half its shops closed and empty of any decoration. “It might be true that the rest of the world is celebrating Christmas while in Palestine we are not,” says Hind, thoughtfully. “But in reality, while the rest of the world celebrates Christmas, we in Palestine are living it.” Qassam Muaddi is The New Arab's correspondent in the West Bank.

    "text": "Clima, il 2023 è stato l’anno più caldo della storia del pianeta. Finora\nIl 2023 è stato l'anno più caldo di sempre. La notizia era nell'aria da mesi e già ai primi di dicembre Copernicus, il servizio europeo di monitoraggio del clima,\naveva annunciato che – salvo sorprese – quello che si appresta a terminare sarebbe stato l'anno con le temperature più elevate dall'inizio delle misurazioni da parte degli scienziati. Novembre, infatti, era stato stato ben 1,75 °C più caldo rispetto alla media (stimata) rilevata per i mesi di novembre tra il 1850 e il 1900, più di 0,25 gradi in più rispetto al target più virtuoso fissato nell'Accordo di Parigi sul Clima del 2015, che prevede di mantenere il riscaldamento entro i 2 °C ma preferibilmente non oltre 1,5 °C. Non solo: novembre 2023 è stato anche il sesto mese consecutivo dell'anno ad aver stracciato i record di “mese più caldo di sempre”, a partire da giugno 2023. I dati relativi a dicembre non sono ancora disponibili, ma è molto probabile che il trend sia stato confermato.\nAnche l'Organizzazione meteorologica mondiale (OMM) – agenzia specializzata delle Nazioni Unite (ONU) per la meteorologia, la climatologia, l'idrologia operativa e le scienze geofisiche – lo scorso 30 novembre aveva affermato che il 2023 sarebbe stato l'anno più caldo mai registrato sulla terra. I dati disponibili fino alla fine di ottobre mostravano infatti una temperatura di circa 1,40 gradi Celsius superiore rispetto al periodo preindustriale 1850-1900. \"I gas serra sono a livelli record. Le temperature globali sono a livelli record. L’innalzamento del livello del mare è a livelli record. Il ghiaccio marino antartico è ai minimi storici. È una cacofonia assordante di dischi rotti\", aveva dichiarato il segretario generale dell'OMM, Petteri Taalas, aggiungendo che \"queste sono più che semplici statistiche. Rischiamo di perdere la corsa per salvare i nostri ghiacciai e frenare l’innalzamento del livello del mare. Non possiamo tornare al clima del XX secolo, ma dobbiamo agire ora per limitare i rischi di un clima sempre più inospitale in questo e nei prossimi secoli. Le condizioni meteorologiche estreme stanno distruggendo vite umane e mezzi di sussistenza ogni giorno\".\nIl record di temperatura media globale, dunque, era ampiamente atteso. D'altro canto i livelli di anidride carbonica sono più alti del 50% rispetto all’era preindustriale, intrappolando il calore nell’atmosfera: questo significa anche che le temperature continueranno ad aumentare per molti anni a venire. Il tasso di innalzamento del livello del mare dal 2013 al 2022 è più del doppio rispetto a quello del periodo 1993-2002 a causa del continuo riscaldamento degli oceani e dello scioglimento dei ghiacciai e delle calotte glaciali. Nel 2023 l’estensione massima del ghiaccio marino antartico è stata la più bassa mai registrata, ben 1 milione di km2 (più della dimensione di Francia e Germania messe insieme) in meno rispetto al minimo record precedente. I ghiacciai nordamericani ed europei hanno subito ancora una volta una stagione di rapido scioglimento. Secondo il rapporto dell’OMM, negli ultimi due anni i ghiacciai svizzeri hanno perso circa il 10% del loro volume residuo.\nInsomma, la situazione è drammatica. Eppure nel 2024 potrebbe andare anche peggio per effetto di El Niño, fenomeno climatico naturale associato al riscaldamento della superficie oceanica nell'Oceano Pacifico tropicale centrale e orientale che tuttavia oggi si verifica nel contesto di un clima profondamente modificato dalle attività umane e dunque segnato negativamente dal Global Warming. Per questo nelle scorse settimane il Segretario Generale dell'OMM, Petteri Taalas, ha ricordato che \"l'impatto di El Niño sulla temperatura globale si manifesta in genere nell'anno successivo al suo sviluppo, in questo caso nel 2024. Ma, a seguito delle temperature terrestri e marine record registrate a partire da giugno, il 2023 è ora sulla buona strada per diventare l'anno più caldo mai registrato. E il prossimo anno potrebbe essere ancora più caldo. Ciò è chiaramente e inequivocabilmente dovuto al contributo delle crescenti concentrazioni di gas a effetto serra, che intrappolano il calore, prodotte dalle attività umane\". Insomma, il 2023 è stato l'anno più caldo della storia del pianeta. Finora.",

    "text": "Denmark Braces for Snowfall and Strong Winds with a Snow Drift Alert in Place\nMuhammad Fazal: The Rising Football Star Poised to Boost Pakistan’s World Cup Hopes\nIn the fevered world of football, a new star is rising on the horizon. The name is Muhammad Fazal, a 21-year-old Danish-born Pakistani, who is poised to reinvigorate Pakistan’s national team. With the upcoming FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, Fazal’s entry could not have been better timed.\nA Danish Born Pakistani Turning Heads\nBorn in Denmark and currently playing as a left back for Nordic United FC in the third tier of the Swedish League, Fazal’s football journey has been nothing short of remarkable. His feats have not only earned him recognition but also a place in the Denmark National team at Under 16 and 19 levels.\nFit for Pakistan’s Game Plan\nFazal’s style of play aligns seamlessly with the tactical preferences of Pakistan’s head coach, Stephen Constantine. In the often employed 4-4-2 formation, the left back role is quite conservative, and this is where Fazal’s skills could come in handy. He is known for his positional awareness, a trait crucial for a fullback. His effective crosses and cut-backs from the left flank are the type of qualities that can address Pakistan’s need for a reliable left back.\nChallenges and Hope\nHowever, roadblocks also exist ahead for Fazal. The most formidable of them is the acquisition of a Pakistani passport and obtaining FIFA clearance to play for the national team. This process could stretch over several months, but with the precedent set by Etzaz Hussain, another Danish-Pakistani who recently acquired Pakistani nationality, there is hope. It is a race against time, but the possibility of Fazal joining the team in time for the qualifiers remains.\nAs the world waits for the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, the potential addition of Muhammad Fazal to Pakistan’s national team might just be the game-changer they need. It is not just about one player; it is about the hopes of a nation yearning for a strong performance in the biggest football event. Fazal’s journey could well be the beacon of hope that Pakistani football needs.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

    "title": "Save Over $800 Off LG's Best 77\" OLED TV of 2022",
    "text": "This short-lived Black Friday deal is back. Best Buy currently has the massive 77\" LG G2 \"Gallery Series\" 4K OLED Smart TV for only $2474.99. This is a clearance item so availability may depend on your region. If you're looking for a gorgeous 77\" TV that delivers a stunning picture while seamlessly blending into your home decor, then this TV should be on your radar.\n77\" LG G2 Gallery Series 4K OLED TV for $2474.99\nThe LG G2 was LG's highest end TV of 2022. This model sits above the C2 in the LG OLED hierarchy. The G2 is dubbed the \"Gallery series\" because of one important attribute: the G2 is built from the ground up to be wall-mounted, and to that end, a wall mount is included instead of a stand. The G2 sits perfectly flush to the wall when mounted. The C2 has a big bulge at the bottom of its cabinet and so it cannot be flush mounted in the same way. Iif you plan on wall mounting your TV, the G2 is the better looking option.\nThe G2 also boasts a 20% brighter panel compared to the Evo C2. This year's C3 model has made improvements to the brightness, but the G2 is still brighter than even the C3 (you'd have to step up to the G3 to get anything better). OLEDs are perfect in almost every way except for the brightness; they are generally less bright than traditional LED LCD TVs. That's why every improvement matters a lot for an OLED TV. A brighter TV means better dynamic range for HDR, but it also means the picture is less likely to be washed out in brightly lit or sun-filled rooms with poor light control.\nAside from that, the G2 is similar to most other true OLED TVs. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, OLED TVs offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations. The first LG OLED TV (a 55\" model) was released back in 2010, well before other manufacturers introduced their own consumer-ready TVs to the market.\nIn addition to the OLED technology, the LG G2 has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM).",
