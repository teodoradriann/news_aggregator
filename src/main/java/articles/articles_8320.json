    "text": "SINGAPORE: A Singaporean teenager of Chinese ethnicity was issued a restriction order by the Internal Security Department (ISD) in November 2023 for espousing white supremacist ideologies , raising concerns about far-right extremism in Singapore.\nThe 16-year-old, according to ISD, had not planned to carry out any attacks in Singapore. Instead, he hoped to be recruited by white supremacist groups to partake in acts of violence overseas.\nWhite supremacy, an extreme right-wing ideology, is based on the belief that whites are racially superior and ought to be protected against perceived threats from non-whites and groups such as LGBTQ+ communities, socialists and feminists.\nThis marks the second case of far-right radicalisation that ISD has dealt with.\nIn its first case in 2020, ISD detained a Singaporean teenager for harbouring violent anti-Muslim sentiments and planning to carry out knife attacks at two mosques in Singapore. The youth, a Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity, was inspired by the mosque shootings in Christchurch by the far-right terrorist Brenton Tarrant.",

    "text": "POCATELLO, Idaho (KIFI)– The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) terminated a $16.4 million grant to Pocatello's Portneuf River Vision project, the city announced in a Facebook post on Tuesday.\nThe Portneuf River Vision is an ongoing effort by multiple city departments to maintain the health of the Portneuf River, improve city parks and recreation areas, and provide better river access for community use.\nPortneuf River Vision was originally awarded the $16.4 million 'Community Change' grant from the EPA in August 2024, to be used for infrastructural improvements to stormwater drainage in Rainey/Centennial Park and Constitution Park, as well as adding sewer systems to south Pocatello neighborhoods and constructing walking paths along South 5th Ave.\nIn their Facebook post on Tuesday, Portneuf River Vision included this quote from the EPA:\n\"This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated effective immediately on the grounds that the remaining portion of the Federal award will not accomplish the EPA funding priorities for achieving program goals. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.\"\nIn the post, Portneuf River Vision stated the remaining grant funds and any costs paid for using grant money will be returned to the EPA.\nLocal News 8 reached out to Portneuf River Vision leaders for comment, however, they said they have no updates at this time.",

    "title": "Poilievre condemns Trudeau’s ‘radical uncontrolled immigration’ policies",
    "text": "Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre did not mince his words Thursday in condemning Trudeau’s “radical uncontrolled immigration” policies.\n“Canada made me a promise. It makes all of us a promise,” opined Poilievre. “Whether we’re born here [or] arrived as immigrants, if you work hard, you get a good life. Anyone from anywhere … gets a powerful paycheck that buys affordable food and homes in safe neighborhoods.”\n“And that promise, like everything else, is broken after nine years of Trudeau and the NDP-Liberals. Most of all, he broke our immigration system,” he said.\nThe Trudeau government, at a separate press conference on Thursday, agreed to a major reduction in the number of permanent residents it will permit entry each year.\nThis year’s Immigration Levels Plan will specifically cut back the number of permanent residents Canada plans to accept through 2027, from 485,000 this year to 395,000 in 2025. It also plans to cut numbers to 380,000 in 2026 and to 365,000 in 2027.\nA previous plan tabled 500,000 additional permanent residents in each of the next two years. “We didn’t get the balance quite right,” admitted Trudeau.\nOn February 12, MPs demanded a review of federal immigration policy after the House of Commons adopted a non-binding Bloc Québécois motion to revise quotas. The proposal passed by a vote of 173-150 but was ultimately ignored by the federal government.\nMost recent immigration data uncovered 471,550 permanent residents, 766,520 temporary foreign workers and 1,040,985 recipients of foreign study permits.\nA 2020 memo forewarned current targets could pose serious challenges to housing, education and health service infrastructure for provinces and municipalities but was also ignored.\n“Trudeau suddenly admitted that ‘radical uncontrolled immigration’ and policies related to it are partly to blame for joblessness, [and the] housing and health care crisis,” Poilievre told reporters.\n“And his immigration minister admits that immigration is out of control,” he added. Canada’s population, according to Statistics Canada’s real-time population clock, is now 41.7 million.\nThe prime minister’s “last minute pre-election reversal cannot be believed,” continued the Tory leader. “He said six months ago he’s going to cap the number of temporary residents in this country to 5% of our population. Since that time, it’s gone up to 7.3%.”\nThe Department of Immigration announced plans on Thursday to cap temporary resident numbers from 6.5% of the total Canadian population to 5% over the next three years. Their numbers exploded to 7.3% earlier this year.\n“Today’s immigration flip flop is a massive admission of failure by Justin Trudeau,” contends Poilievre, who notes the prior crisis at Roxham Road and failure to promptly cap temporary residents are areas of notable concern.\n“He [Trudeau] left Roxham Road open for a year after President Biden offered to close it,” Poilievre said. In 2022, 39,171 asylum seekers crossed Quebec through the unofficial border crossing.\nDespite the closure of Roxham Road on March 24, 2023, thousands more arrived by air, mainly at the airports in Toronto and Montreal.\nCanada border agents processed no less than 3,420 applications at “air points” in Québec since May 2023, including the Montreal-Trudeau Airport — dubbed the “new Roxham Road.” Its closure only “momentarily” slowed the flow of migrants coming to Canada.\nPoilievre also notes the Trudeau government removed the visa requirement for Mexican visitors, causing an explosion of false and fraudulent refugee claims .\nAs reported by Blacklock’s Reporter , Department of Immigration figures last September 30 showed refugee claims by Mexican nationals numbered 22,875 last year — the highest of any country. They previously peaked at 9,511 in 2009, prompting the previous Conservative cabinet to impose visa requirements that Trudeau repealed in 2016.\nThe decision, reversed earlier this year, cost taxpayers $61.7 million annually, according to department officials.\n“We will stop the legal arrival of false refugee claimants by securing our borders, our ports and our airports,” Poilievre promised.\nThe Conservative MP then pivoted to the impacts current immigration targets have had on Canada’s dwindling housing supply.\n“Just nine years ago, we had a housing surplus. We had more houses than were necessary to house the new people coming to the country,” he said.\nA 2020 memo forewarned current targets could pose serious challenges to housing, education and health service infrastructure for provinces and municipalities.\nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CHMC) projects the housing stock will grow by approximately 2.3 million between 2021 and 2030. However, an additional 3.5 million housing units are needed beyond current projections to restore affordability.\n“We will cap population growth so that it is always below the growth in housing, health care and jobs,” Poilievre promised. “We will reverse the uncontrolled approach.”\n“Conservatives will fix what Trudeau and the NDP-Liberals broke. We will restore the best immigration system in the world,” he said.\nSource link",

    "text": "Retired profs at Punjabi varsity not getting pensionary benefits\nRetired professors at Punjabi University, Patiala, are facing financial distress due to the non-disbursement of their pensions and General Provident Fund (GPF)\nPatiala : Retired professors at Punjabi University, Patiala, are facing financial distress due to the non-disbursement of their pensions and General Provident Fund (GPF).\nMany of them have not received their dues since June of last year and the lack of communication from the university’s registrar’s office has only added to their woes. Several retired professors, including Rajesh Sharma and Rajinder Lehri, have voiced their concerns, with Sharma even writing to the Punjab governor, who is the university’s chancellor, to intervene and resolve the issue.\nSharma, who retired as the head of the English department, emphasised that it has been nine months since his retirement, and he has yet to receive either his pension or GPF. He expressed his distress, stating that retired professors are unable to survive without their rightful financial support.\nLehri echoed similar sentiments, calling it humiliating to run from pillar to post to receive pensions after a lifetime of dedication to the university.\nAnother retired professor Jaswinder Saini from the Punjabi department also criticised the delay and urged the university to release their pensions and GPFs, emphasising that these are funds they are entitled to.\nUniversity authorities confirmed the delay but assured that efforts were underway to resolve the matter.\nPunjabi university registrar Sanjiv Puri said the pension files are under process, citing technical issues and pending clearance from the audit department as the main causes of the delay. He added that standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been implemented to ensure faster processing of pension cases.\nKaramjit Singh, who is currently holding the additional charge of the vice-chancellor, expressed regret over the situation and assured that steps were being taken to expedite the disbursement of pensions. He also mentioned that delays from the audit department of the Punjab government were contributing to the delay.\nAdministrative secretary of higher education and school education department, Punjab, Anindita Mitra could not be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts.",

    "text": "El Papa a las ACLI: “sigan con su servicio hacia los más débiles\"\nPatricia Ynestroza-Ciudad del Vaticano\nEl Papa Francisco se encontró esta mañana con la Asociación Cristiana de Trabajadores Italianos, ACLI, en su 80 aniversario de Fundación: una larga y rica historia, que atestigua vuestro compromiso y dedicación al servicio de la comunidad, les dijo Francisco. Agradeció a Dios que ha acompañado esta asociación inspirando a tantas personas, que a través de las ACLI, han dedicado su vida al servicio de los trabajadores, de los pensionistas, de los jóvenes, de los extranjeros y de tantos que se encuentran en situaciones de necesidad.\n“Las ACLI son un lugar donde es posible conocer a los «santos de al lado», que no acaban en las portadas de los periódicos, pero que a veces realmente cambian las cosas, ¡para mejor! Esta historia es un patrimonio del que extraer energía vital para mirar hacia adelante con esperanza y determinación”.\nSentido popular y sinodal\nEl Papa ha reconocido cinco características de esta asociación, es popular porque está cerca del pueblo, porque es y se siente parte del pueblo.\nEn el contexto de una sociedad fragmentada y una cultura individualista, el Pontífice insistió en la necesidad de lugares donde la gente pueda experimentar este “sentido creativo y dinámico de pertenencia, que ayuda a pasar del «yo» al «nosotros», a desarrollar juntos proyectos para el bien común y a encontrar formas y medios para alcanzarlos. Esta es la vocación de vuestros «círculos»: abrir puertas y mantenerlas abiertas, acoger a las personas, permitirles construir lazos de solidaridad y sentido de pertenencia, emprender juntos un camino de integración que desarrolle «una cultura del encuentro en armonía plural» (Exhortación apostólica Evangelii gaudium, 220)”.\nEsta asociación tiene también un estilo sinodal porque trabajan juntos, colaboran por el bien común. Son un conjunto de asociaciones «multiformes e inquietas». Los alentó a que sigan trabajando de esta manera, prestando atención a los débiles de la sociedad, para que nadie se quede atrás.\nEstilo democrático y pacífico\nDemocrático, les dijo, porque esta asociación ha sido siempre fiel a la democracia, entendiendo el concepto de democracia, como una sociedad en la que realmente hay sitio para todos, “en la realidad de los hechos y no sólo en las declaraciones y sobre el papel”, les dijo. Apoyando a quienes corren el riesgo de ser marginados: los jóvenes, a los que dedican especialmente sus iniciativas de formación profesional; las mujeres, que a menudo siguen sufriendo formas de discriminación y desigualdad;\nY un estilo pacífico, porque, añadió el Papa, en un mundo ensangrentado por tantas guerras, esta asociación dedica su compromiso por la paz, y se une al Santo Padre en oración por la paz.\nPorque quien construye la paz sabe adoptar una postura clara, pero al mismo tiempo se esfuerza por tender puentes, escuchar y comprender a las distintas partes implicadas, promoviendo el diálogo y la reconciliación. Interceder por la paz, afirmó, es algo que va mucho más allá del mero compromiso político, porque exige ponerse en juego y asumir un riesgo. En un mundo marcado por el conflicto y la división, el testimonio de las Acli, como pacificadores, como intercesores por la paz, es más necesario y valioso que nunca.\nEstilo cristiano\nAsumir un estilo cristiano significa, dijo por último, no sólo prever un tiempo de oración; significa crecer en la familiaridad con el Señor y en el espíritu del Evangelio, para que impregne todo lo que hacemos y nuestra acción tenga el estilo de Cristo y lo haga presente en el mundo.\n“En particular, frente a las visiones culturales que amenazan con anular la belleza de la dignidad humana y desgarrar la sociedad, los invito a cultivar «un nuevo sueño de fraternidad y amistad social que no se limite a las palabras» (Lett. enc. Fratelli tutti, 6). Es el sueño de san Francisco de Asís y de tantos otros santos, de tantos cristianos, de tantos creyentes de toda fe: ¡que sea también vuestro sueño!”\nGracias por haber leído este artículo.

    "title": "Heal Without Harm Coalition: Condemns Assembly passage of Assembly Bill 975",
    "text": "Today, the Wisconsin State Assembly passed\nAssembly Bill 975 on a 53-46 vote, permitting abortion up to 14-weeks gestation and fast tracking the legislation onto the ballot in April 2024.\nThe Heal Without Harm (HWH) Coalition condemns the passage of AB 975 to introduce an abortion referendum during a time when the current state statute continues to proceed through the court system. The HWH Coalition will continue to defend Wisconsin State Statute 940.04, a law that protects life from conception and\nwhich saved over 1,500 lives since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. We ask the legislature to address s.940.04 following the court challenges.\nThe HWH Coalition thanks the 11 pro-life Republican State Representatives who voted against AB 975 and thereby defended s.940.04. As this legislation proceeds to the Wisconsin State Senate, the HWH Coalition urges all State Senators to oppose AB 975.\nThe abortion issue is not something that can be addressed in one legislative session. It will continue to be a conversation in our culture until we change hearts and minds to favor life.\nWe call on the Wisconsin State Assembly to focus on efforts that demonstrate that being pro-life is more than being against abortion. We urge the Wisconsin State Assembly to pass\nAB 114 extending postpartum care to a year after birth, AB 343 increasing the tax exemption for dependents and including preborn children, AB 344 funding for pregnancy resource centers, and AB 336 creating grants to support adoption. All four bills have already passed the State Senate.\nThe Heal Without Harm Coalition will continue to work to address the real-life situations of those who encounter challenges in pregnancy. We will continue to educate the people of Wisconsin about the lifesaving alternatives to abortion, and we call on the legislature to work with us on accomplishing these goals.",
