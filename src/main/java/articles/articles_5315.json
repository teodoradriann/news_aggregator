    "title": "United Airlines' Maintenance Technicians Turn Down Contract Offer",
    "text": "United Airlines UAL suffered a setback on the labor front when its technicians rejected a contract offer to outsource work to China. An overwhelming 99.5% of the technicians, represented by teamsters, deemed the proposal disgraceful.\nThey believed that these were attempts by UAL to cut their wages and send work to China. Expressing their disapproval, Teamsters’ general president Sean M. O'Brien and Airline Division’s director Chris Griswold stated, \"United Airlines' executives think they can strong-arm 10,000 Teamsters technicians into accepting a terrible deal. Instead, our members just sent a clear message that this company can't ignore. United's radical, un-American contract proposal is dead on arrival”.\nThe rejection came shortly after United Airlines' technicians rallied nationwide, demanding improved wages and more comprehensive health care coverage. The workers picketed last year as well to get their demands approved.\nUAL Stock’s Price Performance\nUnited Airlines' shares have lost 20.7% over the past three months, underperforming the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry’s 6.4% growth. The decline was due to the concerns of a slowdown in air travel demand (particularly for leisure) following tariff-related concerns. The overwhelming rejection of the contract offer, terming it as disgraceful, is a further setback for UAL.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nUAL’s Zacks Rank\nUAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nAirline Stocks to Consider\nInvestors interested in the airline industry may consider SkyWest SKYW and Frontier Group ULCC.\nSkyWest currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
