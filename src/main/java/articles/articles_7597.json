    "text": "The New Orleans Pelicans have done poorly in every game that has been decided by three or fewer points.\nIn fact they are 0-6 in such games, which include each of their past three defeats.\nThursday night New Orleans hosts the Utah Jazz, who have five- and two-point victories against them on Nov. 25 and 27 in Salt Lake City.\n“It’s our free throws. It’s our execution. It’s our turnovers,” New Orleans coach Willie Green said after a 116-115 overtime loss at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. “It’s not one guy. It’s all of us. We have to learn from this. We’re in it together. We have to figure it out together.”\nThe Pelicans also have done poorly with double-digit leads. They led by as many as 15 points in the game and by 13 points at the end of the third quarter before losing to the Grizzlies. That came seven days after they lost a 24-point second-quarter lead in a 115-113 defeat, also at home, against the Grizzlies.\n“For 3 1/2 quarters, our game-plan discipline was at a high level,” Green said of the most recent loss. “We were executing. As the game started to get a little close, they upped their level of physicality and we started to turn the ball over and let them right back into the game.\n“This is where we have to grow,” Green added. “We have to learn to get to our spots, execute with force and pace, make solid passes. Then when we get to the free-throw line, make our free throws.”\nThe Jazz overcame a slow start in a 130-118 victory at San Antonio on Tuesday night. It was their third straight victory during a five-game road trip that concludes in New Orleans.\n“Winning on the road is tough in this league,” Utah coach Will Hardy said. “The trip has been pretty long, a little funky with Christmas in between, but I think the team is just really engaged right now.”\nIt’s also healthy after Keyonte George and Talen Horton-Tucker returned from injury against the Spurs, giving Hardy a healthy rotation for the first time since Nov. 22.\n“We are just getting back to our identity,” said forward Lauri Markkanen, who had 31 points and 12 rebounds against San Antonio. “We are moving with the ball and without the ball, playing unselfish basketball. … That’s really been key for us offensively.”\nThe Jazz have won six of eight overall. Jordan Clarkson scored 24 against the Spurs after scoring 30 three nights earlier against Toronto in his return from a six-game absence due to a thigh injury. He also had eight assists and six rebounds against San Antonio.\n“He’s been known as a scorer his whole career,” Hardy said of Clarkson. “I think the last year and a half, he’s made a really diligent effort to try to be a better playmaker and he’s done a great job.”\nUtah fell behind the Spurs 32-17 after the first 8:40 of action before turning things around with a 10-0 run to close the quarter. The Jazz then scored 103 points the rest of the way.\n– Field Level Media",

    "text": "BOZEMAN, Mont. - The Stillwater Trailhead parking lot has reopened following repairs from severe damage caused by the 2022 flooding event. This trail, valued by hikers, backpackers, horseback riders, and hunters, welcomes visitors once again.\nTwo important bridges—Wounded Man and Flood Creek—on Stillwater Trail #24 have been successfully replaced and are now open. However, the Stillwater Gorge section continues to be closed, with a bypass trail available for hikers.\nIn the week of October 15th, crews will utilize helicopters to transport materials to construction sites. Visitors may encounter construction equipment and an increase in activity. Parking will be limited during this time due to the presence of construction equipment.\nLooking ahead, repair work on the Stillwater Road is slated for 2025. Additionally, more bridges in the Beartooth Ranger District require replacement due to flood damage.\nVisitors planning their adventures are encouraged to contact the Beartooth Ranger District Office at 406-446-2103 for the latest information on trail bridge conditions. This ensures safe and prepared visits to these scenic trails.",

    "text": "Redacción. Guatemala vive horas de angustia tras una serie de sismos que ya dejan al menos cinco muertos y numerosos daños. Las autoridades intensificaron las labores de búsqueda y rescate en distintas regiones del país, mientras continúan registrándose réplicas.\nLos cuerpos de socorro, junto a la Coordinadora Nacional para la Reducción de Desastres (Conred), reportan víctimas mortales, derrumbes y emergencias provocadas por los movimientos telúricos que comenzaron el martes 8 de julio.\nLos cuerpos de socorro han trabajado de forma coordinada para rescatar personas y recuperar los cadáveres de las víctimas. Según el último informe de la Conred, los movimientos telúricos han causado la muerte de al menos cinco personas en distintos puntos del país.\nMascotas\nUna de las tragedias ocurrió en El Tablón, Bárcenas, Villa Nueva. Regina López, de 35 años, perdió la vida tras quedar soterrada por un derrumbe mientras recogía leña junto a sus seis hijos, quienes sobrevivieron ilesos.\nLa búsqueda duró aproximadamente dos horas y media. Equipos de Conred, Bomberos Voluntarios y Bomberos Municipales Departamentales localizaron el cuerpo de López la mañana del miércoles 9 de julio. El derrumbe ocurrió el martes como consecuencia directa de los sismos.\nRegina estaba acompañada por sus dos perros, Spike y Negro. Este último, un mestizo que logró escapar, ayudó a los rescatistas a ubicar los cuerpos de su dueña y de Spike, al guiar a los socorristas hasta el lugar del derrumbe.\nOtra tragedia se reportó en el kilómetro 47 de la ruta de Palín, Escuintla, hacia Santa María de Jesús, Sacatepéquez. Una roca de gran tamaño cayó sobre un vehículo pick-up, causando la muerte de un padre y su hijo.\nEl Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulcanología, Meteorología e Hidrología (Insivumeh) informó que, desde la tarde del martes 8 de julio hasta el mediodía del miércoles 9, se han registrado 190 temblores, de los cuales 19 fueron sensibles para la población.",
