    "text": "Chennaiyin FC's Defensive Struggles Continue: Coach Coyle Calls for Fan Support Amid Winless Streak\nChennaiyin FC's head coach Owen Coyle urged fans to support the team as they face defensive challenges and a seven-game winless streak. Coyle highlighted the need for better defense after a 1-3 loss to Kerala Blasters FC, attributing the defeat to ongoing defensive frailties.\n- Country:\n- India\nChennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle lamented his team's persistent defensive struggles following their 1-3 defeat to Kerala Blasters FC at Chennai's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Thursday. The match saw the home side reduced to ten men, further complicating their efforts as the visitors capitalized, taking a commanding 3-0 lead.\nThe lone consolation for Chennaiyin FC came from Vincy Barretto, who netted a goal during stoppage time in the second half. This loss marks another setback for the club as they drift further from the top six positions in the league standings.\nCoach Coyle, addressing the media in his post-match remarks, acknowledged that the defensive weaknesses have plagued the team all season. 'We conceded a very soft goal early on, and the defensive response should have been stronger,' stated Coyle via the official ISL website.\nEmphasizing the need for personal accountability, Coyle remarked, 'Defensively, we fell short, and this has been a recurring issue throughout the season. It's important for us as individuals to take responsibility.' He also encouraged fans to continue supporting the team during the winless stretch that has now extended to seven games.\nCoyle expressed gratitude for the loyal fanbase, urging them to stand by the club during these trying times. 'To our fans, I say continue to support us. Chennaiyin FC is a club to love through ups and downs, and your support is invaluable,' he commented.\nThe 58-year-old coach also mentioned the need for the team to quickly refocus on upcoming matches, highlighting the fast-paced nature of football. 'We must not dwell on the defeat. Football evolves rapidly, and it's critical that we bounce back with renewed desire and urgency,' he concluded. (ANI)\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes",

    "text": "[](/bd/corporate/companies/ten-entrepreneurs-picked-for-inaugural-startup-scale-up-program--4541150) Ten entrepreneurs picked for inaugural startup scale up program [Visual Arts](/bd/lifestyle/art/visual-arts) Artist evokes Palestinian suffering with paintingsFriday March 01 2024 Three exhibitions in three separate gallery spaces opened last weekend at One Off in Nairobi. Each is very different, but all have something to say about our life and times. They are Patrick Karanja, James Mweu, and Xavier Verhoest. It’s reminiscent of what Carol Lees used to do as the co-owner (with Mary Collis) and curator of RaMoMa (Rahmtulah Museum of Modern African Art) when it was still standing on Second Avenue Parklands in Nairobi. For a time in the early 2000s, she would curate seven separate gallery spaces a once. Sadly, Ramoma shut down in 2010, but Carol remained well as she went back to her home base at One Off, which she had opened in 1994 and never closed. Inside the Loft, one will find James Karanja’s fascinating collection of prints called collagraphs. He entitles his exhibition ‘Wormhole’ referring to a theoretical concept all about bridging long distances separating spaces and times. He wraps so many concepts together in just less than 30 prints, everything from the role of technology in bridging gaps between generations to appraising the way communication tools have transformed our everyday lives. “People used to write letters and share their deeper thoughts, but now, we do everything on our phones,” Karanja tells BDLife. He shared old advertisements to shop in elegant department stores, now rendered obsolete since we do all our shopping online. He ends with a series of fancy screen savers for our mobile phones, our new best friends. James’ Mweu and Karanja have several things in common, apart from their first names. They both favour printmaking and they’ve both been working for their respective exhibitions at the Mandy Bonnell Print Studio, which is also based at One Off. Bonnell, though based in the UK, is still considered a part of the One Off family. She has been running printmaking workshops at One Off since the 1990s and donated a printer to the gallery in 2022. ‘But it wasn’t installed until 2023,” Carol tells BDLife, noting that initially, Mandy’s print workshops took place at Yony Waite’s Wildebeest Workshop in Lamu. (The memorial service for Yony will take place March 5 from 4-8 at Circle Art Gallery.) Mweu’s exhibition occupies one portion of the Stables and utilises it well with woodcut prints and the boards the artist carved and etched in to create his elegant line prints of trees. Why trees? We ask. ‘Because I’m a hiker who hikes all over the country and often through forests still covered in trees,” he says. Having made a limited edition of his prints, and just six woodcut boards, his focus is strictly on one of Kenya’s many endangered species, our forests and our trees. Xavier Verhoest has taken a brave step making a powerful statement in his paintings and photographs that he prepared to display in “Our Memories Can’t Wait (For Palestine)”. “I am so proud of Carol for bringing Xavier’s exhibition to One Off,” noted one Dutch woman who felt compelled to speak out about the tragedy ongoing in the Middle East, particularly in Palestine. “This exhibition is the first one to use the visual arts to protest what’s happening to the Palestinian people.” But I must correct her since the first one was staged a month ago at the Cheche Gallery at the Kenya Cultural Centre by a group sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people whose stories are rarely told in their most raw reality. That show featured mainly political posters cartoons and photographs from all over the world, all bearing the same message, that a ceasefire needs to happen now. Xavier confesses in touching remarks made on a framed introduction board, that he first began to paint seriously while working for Doctors without Borders (MSF) in Jerusalem in 1999. He was deeply moved by that experience of living amidst the trials, traumas, and tragedies inflicted on the Palestinians who were locked into small strips of land, under Israel’s dominant neo-colonial control. The situation was so dark emotionally that he had to do something to create his concept of beauty to contrast the blight that lay all around him. Since he departed from Gaza, Xavier has been haunted by his memories of that experience. So much so that he had to create abstract paintings meant to capture colours, moods, and memories that might transcend the painful reality which continues in Palestine. Xavier has had many exhibitions both in and outside Kenya. But for me, this one is his finest and most soulful.

    "text": "Más de 30,000 trabajadores de Boeing se preparaban para hacer huelga el viernes, deteniendo la producción de la mayoría de los aviones de la compañía después de que el personal rechazara abrumadoramente un nuevo contrato laboral.\nEs un desarrollo costoso para el fabricante que ha luchado por aumentar la producción y restaurar su reputación después de las crisis de seguridad de sus aviones.\nLos trabajadores de Seattle y de Oregon votaron el 94.6% en contra de un acuerdo provisional que Boeing y la Asociación Internacional de Maquinistas y Trabajadores Aeroespaciales dieron a conocer el domingo. Los trabajadores votaron el 96% a favor de una huelga, mucho más de los dos tercios de los votos necesarios para un paro laboral.\n“Haremos huelga a medianoche”, dijo el presidente del Distrito 751 de la IAM, Jon Holden, en una conferencia de prensa donde anunció los resultados de la votación. La calificó de “huelga por prácticas laborales injustas”, alegando que los trabajadores de la fábrica habían experimentado “conducta discriminatoria, interrogatorios coercitivos, vigilancia ilegal y tuvimos promesas ilegales de beneficios”.\nHolden dijo que Boeing necesita negociar de buena fe.\nBoeing no hizo comentarios de inmediato, pero Stephanie Pope, directora ejecutiva de la unidad de aviones comerciales de Boeing, dijo a los maquinistas a principios de esta semana que el acuerdo provisional era el “mejor contrato que hemos presentado jamás”.\n“En negociaciones anteriores, la idea era que debíamos reservarnos algo para poder ratificar el contrato en una segunda votación”, dijo Pope. “Hablamos de esa estrategia esta vez, pero elegimos deliberadamente un nuevo camino”.\nEl acuerdo habría aumentado los salarios en un 25%, reducido la parte de los empleados en los costos de atención médica y aumentado las contribuciones de jubilación de la empresa.\nAdemás, Boeing prometió que el próximo avión de la compañía se construiría en sus instalaciones en el noroeste del Pacífico, en lugar de en la planta no sindicalizada de Boeing en Carolina del Sur.\nPero muchos miembros de base del sindicato no estaban contentos con la oferta, que no alcanzaba el aumento del 40% y los cambios en las pensiones que buscaba el sindicato.\nLa votación de huelga llega en un momento difícil para Boeing, que ya está lidiando con una crisis de seguridad después de que un panel de tapón de puerta explotara en el aire de un avión 737 Max en enero.\nEso obligó a la empresa a reducir la producción de su avión más vendido mientras trabaja para apuntalar el control de calidad en sus fábricas y cadena de suministro, y reconstruir la confianza con las aerolíneas, los reguladores y el público que viaja.\nSigue leyendo:\n• Boeing, la empresa que se declaró culpable por cargos relacionados con la seguridad de sus aviones\n• Más de 2,600 aviones de Boeing irán a revisión por problemas con sus máscaras de oxígeno\n• Departamento de Justicia presenta acuerdo de culpabilidad con Boeing tras accidentes fatales",
