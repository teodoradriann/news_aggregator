    "text": "Chapter 1871 – Scorching Emperor\nAs the sun emperor put it, the alliance’s troops were just a ragtag bunch with no redeeming qualities apart from their lack of fear of death. The myriad sects’ side was already steadily crumbling; it would only be a matter of time until their complete collapse. The looming threat of death caused despair to begin creeping up on them. They were already the biggest force there was. There would be no reinforcements coming from anybody else.\nThat was what the Saintdragon Emperor and the rest were worried about. The celestial orderians had far outstripped the Myriad Solar Sects in terms of might. Even the mighty victories they had won the past few times seemed inconsequential, barely leaving a dent in the total celestial orderian forces.\n“Mount a fighting retreat!” That was the only thing Tianming could do. Lan Huang suddenly turned back, skewering many celestial orderians with the spikes on its scales. It was completely dyed red from head to toe. Ying Huo and Meow Meow weren’t faring much better, either. They both adopted their larger fighting forms and rained down attacks on the enemy, sometimes even fighting in close combat, leaving trails of corpses behind them. Some were even burned to the point that they were reduced to ash before they even fell to the ground.\nThe battlefield was gory beyond description, seemingly a projection of h.e.l.l upon the living world. Countless people fell on both sides. Tianming’s eyes were bloodshot from what he saw. He could no longer spare any care for the sheer loss of life. As the one who bore the hope of the entire Myriad Solar Sects, the only thing he could do was kill as many enemies as possible to repay them.\nHe charged at the enemy’s flank with his beasts at the point of entry into the formation. Tianming had already dispatched the leader of the troops before them, so turning to the flank was relatively risk free.\n“Follow the Imperialdragon Princeps!” The Ninedragon Army troops were incredibly spirited. They led their dragons into the sky and followed Tianming with full fervor. Tianming’s lifebound beasts paved a way through enemy ranks like a hot knife through b.u.t.ter, seemingly unstoppable.\nThen a hundred thousand enemies formed a wall using their totems and launched their totemic calamities at him! As the troops behind him were still some ways back, he would have to take on all the attacks alone.\n“Die!” His totem swords flew out ahead of him as he charged toward the s.h.i.+eld of totems without hesitation. The totemic calamities could reduce everything before them to ash, but at that instant, forty-nine different divine wonders appeared before Tianming, spanning a wide area. Apart from them were forty-nine dreamless whales, seemingly swimming in the ocean of stars. Their deep cries flooded the battlefield and drowned out much of the noise. The whales and divine wonders intercepted the totemic calamities, causing a huge commotion of light, sound, and rumbling around the battlefield. It seemed even more potent than the Divine Wrath blasts. The divine wonders, whales, and totemic calamities canceled each other out and were reduced to nothing.\n“Is he dead?!” The hundred thousand celestial orderians looked around, wide eyed. Their totems protectively cl.u.s.tered together as a huge flaming s.h.i.+eld. The next instant, a gigantic two-headed dragon charged out of the smoke and fire. Subsequently, blasts of flames and lightning came was.h.i.+ng over them.\n“He didn’t die!”\n“Everyone to attention!”\nRight after that, a gigantic white tower tens of thousands of meters tall slammed down with great force, shattering the s.h.i.+eld and scattering the totems as flesh and blood went spraying all over the place. At the same time, countless totem swords shredded through the ranks of the totemancers, causing it to rain corpses.f?ee????૦ѵ?Ɩ. ???\nTianming’s Omnisentient Threads had reached five billion in number, far more than before. He was receiving so much energy that he believed he wouldn’t be able to manage it without the help of his two sacrosuns.\n“Die!” he and Lan Huang roared, smas.h.i.+ng past the totem remnants and crus.h.i.+ng an entire line of enemies. Even though the hundred thousand that died there were just a small drop among the three hundred million, it was a huge wound that the Ninedragon Army behind Tianming could infect.\nJoined by the elites from other first-rate sects, the Ninedragon Army flooded into that part of the battlefield, intent on cutting off the celestial orderians within the formation from those outside, greatly increasing the amount of casualties they were inflicting.\nOn such a battlefield, no strategy or tactic could save oneself apart from sheer desperation. Even so, the alliance wouldn’t be able to undertake such a penetrative maneuver without Tianming. That totem s.h.i.+eld would have caused unbelievable damage to them; but as long as Tianming fought at the vanguard, they would have hope. The Ninedragon Army troops were his most ardent supporters, his hardened dragon warriors! They gave their all to follow him in his path.\nTheir sudden charge through the enemy ranks began splitting the enemy troops into two. Tianming had given it his all. This was the limit of his abilities as a single individual on the battlefield. n.o.body else there could do nearly as much as he did. If it weren’t for the Ninedragon Army’s sudden charge under his lead, the alliance’s army would already start crumbling.\nEven so, Tianming knew that his powers had come from the people. He was just something similar to the Aeonic Infinidragon Formation. There seemed to be a feedback loop that caused his power to increase with every successive feat he accomplished. There were a billion G.o.ds on the battlefield, and it was already a miracle of the Primordial G.o.d-Emperor’s legacy that he was able to connect with seven hundred million of them. While the alliance’s army was weaker, they were still able to hold on, thanks to Tianming giving them hope.\n“Keep fighting!”\n“Li Tianming’s still with us!”\n“We haven’t lost yet! There’s still hope!”\n“The formation is still holding, and we’re alive! Let’s fight until we bleed ourselves dry!”\nThey held Tianming as their paragon and sought to emulate him. From the sky, he was leading the Ninedragon Army into the inner ranks of the celestial orderians, causing great problems for their logistics and supplies.\n“Fight back!”\n“Surround them! It’s the only chance for us to win!”\nThe fact that they were still able to fight meant that their minds were still clear. They took decisive action as best they could.\n“Can the formation power up even more?”\n“Brothers, if we don’t resist harder, we’ll lose our chance!”\n“We have to fight as a united whole!”\nHope from Tianming spread like wildfire across the battlefield. The celestial orderians were really starting to feel the heat. But at that crucial moment, a golden figure emerged from the Divine Sun Palace and rapidly descended like a meteor.\n“The sun emperor emerged!” Countless people cried out at the same time. The celestial orderians cheered while the alliance troops anxiously watched. Tianming had shone too brightly on the battlefield, so there was no way for him to hide. As expected, the sun emperor went charging for him.\n“Imperialdragon Princeps, run!”\nThe Ninedragon Army troops around Tianming stiffened from innate fear.\n“Li Tianming, leave quickly. The sun emperor has left the palace, so it’s no longer being piloted. That means the formation will be able to divert more power to the invading force rather than defense, so you can afford to hide for now!”\nMany seniors urged Tianming to run, but he shook his head. He calmly pointed at the sky, causing everyone to look up. The Divine Sun Palace was gathering another wave of power. Its Divine Wrath was still being charged up, and Tianming had lost his chance to run. The sun emperor had already locked onto him.",

    "text": "Catholic Bishops Sue Biden Administration Over Abortion Provisions in Pregnant Workers Law The bishops express concern in their lawsuit that the EEOC’s inclusion of abortion could jeopardize pro-life speech from certain employers, as it could be seen as retaliation. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and other Catholic institutions [filed a lawsuit](https://becketnewsite.s3.amazonaws.com/20240522224428/2024-05-22-1-Complaint.pdf) against President Joe Biden’s administration over new rules that could require them to provide workplace accommodations for women who seek abortions. The lawsuit challenges [regulations issued](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/257405/biden-administration-to-mandate-employers-grant-leave-for-workers-to-obtain-abortions) by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) related to the implementation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The Catholic University of America (CUA) and two Catholic dioceses joined the USCCB in the lawsuit. Although the law itself does not mention abortion, the regulations would require that employers accommodate women for workplace limitations that arise from “having or choosing not to have an abortion.” The law requires that employers provide reasonable accommodations to women who develop workplace limitations from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The EEOC rules consider “having or choosing not to have an abortion” as one of the related medical conditions covered under the legislation. The law itself also includes a prohibition on interference with the accommodations or retaliation against a person who uses the accommodations. The bishops express concern in their lawsuit that the EEOC’s inclusion of abortion could jeopardize pro-life speech from certain employers, as it could be seen as retaliation. Religious employers are subject to the rules, but the EEOC will consider requests for religious exemptions to certain aspects of the rules on a case-by-case basis. The bishops, who are represented by the legal advocacy group Becket Law, argue in the lawsuit that the EEOC’s inclusion of abortion accommodations must be declared invalid because it is “contrary to the [law’s] plain text and purpose.” “Intentionally ending a pregnancy is opposed to both pregnancy and childbirth, and is not a related medical condition to either,” the lawsuit states. It further argues that the religious exemption is insufficient because addressing those requests on a case-by-case basis would ensure “religious defendants could never know ahead of time if they would face liability for exercising their rights.” “The end result stacks the decks against religious employers: In EEOC’s view, the agency could normally be sure that it would have a compelling interest sufficient to override religious defenses,” the lawsuit adds. The lawsuit also states that the EEOC’s inclusion of abortion goes against legislative intent. It cites several lawmakers who supported the legislation saying that the EEOC could not interpret the law to mandate accommodations for abortions. One lawmaker cited is Sen. Bob Casey Jr., a Democrat from Pennsylvania, who sponsored the Senate version of the bill. “Under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, the [EEOC] could not — could not — issue any regulation that requires abortion leave, nor does the act permit the EEOC to require employers to provide abortions in violation of state law,” Casey [said on the Senate floor](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/volume-168/issue-191/senate-section/article/S7049-2#:~:text=Mr.%20CASEY.%20Just,generally%20not%20%0Areasonable.) in December 2022. Laura Wolk Slavis, one of the lawyers representing the bishops, told CNA that the law “does not mention abortion at all.” She said it is intended to ensure employers provide accommodations “related to a woman being able to have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy childbirth.” “This law was meant to be a very simple, uncontroversial law that all Americans can and should support,” Slavis added. The EEOC’s regulations, she said, is an attempt to “hijack that law and turn it into something fundamentally different.” Slavis also said the EEOC’s decision to address religious exemptions on a case-by-case basis means the bishops and all religious employers are “forced to comply right now” and do not know whether they will receive exemptions when requested. She said the EEOC “interpreted that exemption so narrowly that it means nothing.” CUA President Peter Kilpatrick [said in a statement](https://communications.catholic.edu/news/2024/05/catholic-university-opposes-abortion-accommodations-in-pregnant-workers-legislation.html#:~:text=The%20Catholic%20University%20of%20America,Workers%20Fairness%20Act%20(PWFA).) that the university provides accommodations for pregnant workers but that the abortion accommodation requirement conflicts with the university’s mission. “The Catholic University of America community remains steadfast in our commitments to upholding the sanctity of life and supporting women and pregnant mothers in the workplace,” Kilpatrick said. “We firmly reject any suggestion of tension between those two core commitments. We can — and we do — support women as they grow their families, and we believe it is possible to do so wholeheartedly while also supporting the dignity of life at all stages. Our mission to cultivate a culture of love, respect, and compassion demands nothing less.” When reached for comment, the EEOC referred CNA to the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. - Keywords: [USCCB](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/usccb) [USCCB lawsuit](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/usccb-lawsuit) [catholic university of america](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/catholic-university-of-america) [EEOC](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/eeoc) [abortion](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/abortion) [pregnant workers law](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/pregnant-workers-law) [religious exemption](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/religious-exemption)",

    "text": "All-inclusive? Von wegen: Wie Hotels ihre Gäste austricksen\nZum Frühstück Sekt und „Käse bis zum Horizont“: Ein Hotelexperte verrät, wie sich all-inclusive für Hotels rechnet und für welche Urlauber es sich lohnt.\nWas haben Eltern mit Kindern und Menschen, die im Urlaub gerne viel Alkohol trinken, gemeinsam? Für beide lohnt sich am ehesten ein Urlaub im All-inclusive-Hotel, sagt der Hotel- und Gastroexperte Michael Bauer. „Die Rechnung geht für den Gast nur auf, wenn man gerne Alkohol konsumiert. Sonst wird es schwierig, den Preis zu rechtfertigen“, erklärt er BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA. Auch Eltern gehören zur Zielgruppe, weil Kinder ständig etwas essen und trinken wollen würden. „Mit einem All-inclusive-Paket nervt das nicht mehr.“\nDrei Cappuccinos zum Frühstück, um 10 Uhr den ersten Prosecco, Kinder, die abwechselnd Fanta, Eis oder Pommes fordern – für die entsprechenden Zielgruppen rechnet sich das All-inclusive-Paket also. Doch mit welchen Strategien beeinflussen Hotels ihre Gäste, um am Ende trotzdem Gewinn zu machen?\nTricks, wie All-inclusive-Hotels ihre Gäste im Urlaub beeinflussen\nHotels kalkulieren genau, was ihre Gäste konsumieren. „Bei Getränken rechnet der Hotelier zum Beispiel mit Pauschalen: Mehr als vier Cappuccinos trinkt niemand“, sagt Bauer. 4,70 Euro Wareneinsatz pro Person würde in etwa für Kaffee und Frühstück reichen. Beim Speisenangebot am Bufett würden die Hotels mit günstigen Sattmachern und Füllern arbeiten: „Hühnerbeine kosten fast nichts, Spaghetti-Salat macht satt und ist billig. Frische Komponenten findet man da oft nicht“, sagt Bauer. Beim Dessert sehe es ähnlich aus: Wassermelonen und Softeis für die Kinder – das sei günstig und fülle das Bufett.\nMit einfachen Tricks erwecken All-inclusive-Hotels bei ihren Gästen den Eindruck einer breiten Auswahl. „Ein gutes Beispiel ist der Käse am Bufett. Da wird billiger Käse im Block gekauft, und ein guter Küchenchef schneidet ihn in Scheiben, Dreiecke und Würfel, legt ihn auf silberne Platten und präsentiert ‚Käse bis zum Horizont‘. Der Kunde denkt dann: ‚Was für eine Auswahl!‘ Aber in Wahrheit ist es immer derselbe Käse“, sagt Bauer. Mit kleinen Gläsern am Bufett könne das Hotel seine Gäste bei den eher teuren frischen Säften bremsen. „Sie müssten öfter gehen, und das macht fast niemand.“\nAuch bei alkoholischen Getränken hätten die All-inclusive-Hotels ihre Strategien. Inländische Spirituosen, Bier und Wein seien dabei, aber kein Bordeaux-Rotwein aus erster Lage. Stattdessen gebe es günstige Marken, die als Tischwein in vielen Clubs ausgeschenkt werden würden. „Teure Export-Spirituosen schließt der Hotelier aus, um sich abzusichern“, sagt Bauer BuzzFeed News Deutschland.\nWoran Gäste ein wirklich gutes Hotel erkennen\nDer Experte verrät, woran Gäste ein wirklich gutes Hotel erkennen: „Am Müsli!“ Gute Hotels hätten meist eine Getreidemühle, würden das Getreide frisch schroten. Manchmal werde es dann über Nacht in Orangensaft eingelegt. Am nächsten Tag kämen Apfel, Nüsse und Beeren dazu. „Das sind die kleinen Details, an denen man erkennt, ob ein Hotel Qualität liefert oder spart“, erklärt Bauer.\nAll-inclusive-Urlauber wissen schon bei der Buchung, was sie am Ende bezahlen und können sich frei auf dem Hotel-Gelände bewegen. Damit dieses Konzept nicht von Touristen aus anderen Hotels ausgenutzt werde, gebe es in All-inclusive-Hotels sehr starke Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, weiß der Hotelexperte Bauer. „Die Anlagen sind vom Zutritt her gut geschützt, mit Security und Bändchen. Externe erkennt man schnell, etwa an anderen Handtüchern“, sagt er. Doch das Bändchensystem habe Schwachstellen. Es gebe nicht viele Hersteller, und Muster könne man sich gegen Geld besorgen. „Wenn jemand wirklich tricksen will, ist das immer möglich.“",

    "text": "When Mel Manuel came out as queer as an 8-year-old, some members of their devout Southern Baptist family believed all queer people were condemned to hell. Manuel, of Covington, didn’t know “a single LGBTQ person.” “I had to be quiet my whole life about who I was,” Manuel said. “My parents did not accept it. My family absolutely did not accept it. Our school system did nothing.” Thirty-two years later, Manuel, 40, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, feels they can now be the queer person they wished they’d known as a kid. That drove Manuel to help [organize the first Pride parade on the northshore](https://www.nola.com/news/communities/st_tammany/st-tammany-parish-will-have-its-first-ever-lgbtq-pride-parade-after-emotional-meeting-louisiana/article_4a8ea3c0-f8e3-11ee-b218-e3f445ad8399.html), which took place on Saturday with along Mandeville's lakefront. More than 500 people marched in the parade. “It feels empowering,\" Manuel said. \"It feels like saying, ‘I’m not going back to the closet, St. Tammany.’” Along the parade route a giant, rainbow-colored pelican statue trailed behind a Jeep with its own rainbow decals. Overhead, dark clouds threatened downpours, but the rain stayed light as paraders made their way along Lakeshore Drive. Outside the bars along the route, patrons came out to wave and show support, as a teenager asked a drag queen for a selfie. A handful of protesters showed up as well, holding up anti-LGBTQ+ signs and reciting prayers. Manuel teamed up with Jeremy Thompson to found Queer Northshore, which helped organize the parade and strives to create a community for queer people in St. Tammany Parish and across the northshore. To its members, having an organization devoted to advocating for queer people feels especially necessary in the face of what some members say is anti-LGBTQ sentiment on the northshore. They note the challenges some St. Tammany residents have filed to restrict books in the public libraries with LGBTQ+ themes. Last year, a billboard in Abita Springs that read “Ban hate, not books,” drawn by a trans teenager, [was torched](https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/ban-hate-not-books-sign-in-abita-springs-torched/article_150e7d24-d571-11ed-9e05-574365c519c2.html). And just this week, as the parade drew near, a Pride flag was stolen from a Mandeville home and burned, some [media outlets reported](https://www.fox8live.com/2024/05/31/pride-flag-stolen-burned-near-mandeville-ahead-first-pride-parade-community-rallies-support/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2PpM6ja2isQVHNuVNx_VtEWkEqqOWRhqgSly89dtKpEKgnEqVXg25BTEk_aem_ZmFrZWR1bW15MTZieXRlcw). But the group’s members are undeterred. “The more visible we become the more we’re going to experience this kind of hate,” Manuel wrote in a comment on Facebook about the flag burning. “We fight back with MORE FLAGS!” another user wrote. How it got started Queer Northshore started as a Facebook group in the waning days of the coronavirus pandemic. Manuel and Thompson, who had lived in the two sides of a shotgun house in New Orleans, moved to St. Tammany. “A few months in, we realized, not so surprisingly, that it was incredibly hard to make friends,” Thompson said. “So we did the conventional thing. We created a Facebook group. … There was no aspiration for it other than, like, it would be cool to attract a bunch of people and have parties and events and hang out.” The group exploded. Two years later, it has 2,400 members. It’s extremely active, with its members posting dozens of times every day. The group has provided invaluable support to St. Tammany’s queer community. For instance, some members have sought advice from others about finding trans-friendly health care on the northshore. Others have formed important friendships. For some, the group kept them from decamping from the northshore altogether. “My girlfriend, who is smarter than I am, said, ‘Hey, look, if I find us friends that you respect and that you want to be around, will you stay?’” said Jamie Foster of Abita Springs, one of the group’s straight, cis-gendered members. “I thought, ‘Of course I will, but there’s nobody here like that.’ And then she immediately proved me wrong.” “We didn’t know this community was even out there,” his girlfriend, Evette Randolph, said. “There wasn’t anywhere to meet, there wasn’t anywhere to feel safe.” Ruby Porter, who built the parade's pelican statue, said that she felt lost before she found the group. “I had really just come out,” she said. “I was in a bad place. I was really depressed. And they really helped out a lot, and gave me a place to be seen.” “I really kind of owe them my life,” she added. Growing into advocacy But as controversy around books in the parish’s libraries started to ramp up, Manuel and Thompson realized the group needed to evolve. “At that point we decided, the need isn’t just for hangouts,” Manuel said. “We’re being targeted by people in our own community.” Thompson and Manuel incorporated Queer Northshore as a nonprofit, and helped start the St. Tammany Parish Library Alliance, a group that has fought to keep LGBTQ-themed books on the library’s shelves. Manuel is even running [a long-shot campaign](https://www.mel4louisiana.com/) for Congress against U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a ranking Republican. Members of Queer Northshore described this weekend’s parade as the culmination of community building and organizing, a pivotal moment in the group’s effort to reshape the stereotype that the northshore isn’t welcoming to queer people or their allies. \"I’m not trying to make children queer,” Manuel said, noting that their own child is straight. “I’m trying to make queer children feel loved and accepted and like they’re normal, because they are.”",
