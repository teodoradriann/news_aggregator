    "title": "Study: $750 a month improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on? That question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized. Those who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered. “I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study. People are also reading… “It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.” About 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said. The participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly. A follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change. The study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls. That evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars. “You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him. Adler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him. After a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy. Rather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list. After six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%. The cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75. Among those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said. “It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.” In other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered. “I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.” “It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.” 20 facts about homelessness in the US 20 facts about homelessness in the US According to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022 The U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020 Conversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010 Experts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness The end of the federal eviction moratorium in August 2021 made millions of Americans' housing situations more precarious during the long tail of the COVID-19 pandemic As of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month The marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness HUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022 A greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020 40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered Chronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020 Veteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010 Family and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020 50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022 Since 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12% 6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020 In 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8% The number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Peso do pai influencia o tamanho do bebê ao nascer, aponta estudo da USP; saiba como",
    "text": "Estudo realizado com 89 pares de pais e filhos mostrou haver uma associação entre o excesso de peso paterno e o peso do bebê ao nascer. Quanto maior o índice de massa corporal (IMC, ou seja, relação peso/altura) do pai , menor era o do recém-nascido. Os resultados, divulgados no International Journal of Obesity, reforçam a ideia de que questões antropométricas não estão exclusivamente a encargo das mães e que a manutenção de um estilo de vida saudável também deve ser uma preocupação dos homens antes da concepção de um bebê. “Muito se fala e há muitos estudos sobre a relação entre o desenvolvimento do bebê e a saúde materna, incluindo questões como excesso de peso no período pré-gestacional e gestacional , mas o fato é que a saúde dos pais também tem um grande impacto no desenvolvimento tanto fetal quanto depois do nascimento do bebê. Nosso estudo foi o primeiro realizado com famílias brasileiras a mostrar que, quanto maior o IMC do pai, menor é o peso do bebê no nascimento. E evidencia a importância do pai nas questões de saúde e desenvolvimento do bebê”, destaca Mariana Rinaldi Carvalho , bolsista da FAPESP e coautora do artigo. O peso do bebê ao nascer é considerado um preditor importante para a saúde não só na infância , mas em toda a vida adulta. Além do maior risco de morte, diversos estudos já demonstraram que bebês que nascem com baixo (ou alto) peso podem vir a desenvolver doenças não transmissíveis ao longo da vida, como as cardiovasculares, diabetes do tipo 2 e alguns tipos de câncer . O trabalho, realizado por pesquisadoras da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto da Universidade de São Paulo (FMRP-USP), é o desdobramento um estudo clínico maior apoiado pela FAPESP, que avaliou a efetividade do aconselhamento nutricional em 350 gestantes com sobrepeso, atendidas em Unidades Básicas de Saúde (UBS). “Em estudos conduzidos entre gestantes, notamos haver um componente faltando na equação que envolve o estilo de vida materno e o recém-nascido. Por isso, miramos na análise do efeito da antropometria paterna no desenvolvimento fetal”, conta Daniela Saes Sartorelli , professora do Departamento de Medicina Social da FMRP-USP que orientou o estudo de doutorado de Carvalho. O grupo ainda vai analisar o efeito da dieta paterna na antropometria e adiposidade neonatal. Serão considerados parâmetros como o consumo de ultraprocessados e a qualidade da gordura da dieta paterna. Leia também Saúde pública O excesso de peso materno é considerado uma questão de saúde pública. Diversos estudos já demonstraram que o ganho excessivo de peso durante a gestação expõe tanto a mulher quanto o bebê a riscos aumentados de saúde no curto e longo prazo. Na mãe, eleva os riscos de diabetes gestacional, hipertensão , pré-eclâmpsia e cesarianas. Na criança, há uma alta probabilidade de, no curto prazo, os bebês nascerem com alto ou baixo peso. No longo prazo, há o risco aumentado de desenvolverem obesidade e doenças associadas, como diabetes tipo 2 ou hipertensão arterial, em uma idade precoce. Se no caso das mães há uma relação direta via placenta e outras células entre a obesidade e o desenvolvimento fetal, o excesso de peso paterno pode levar a algumas alterações epigenéticas (modificações bioquímicas no DNA que reprogramam a expressão dos genes). Segundo Carvalho, estudos anteriores conduzidos em animais já haviam demonstrado que alguns genes expressos pelo pai podem afetar o crescimento feto-placentário. De acordo com a pesquisadora, esses estudos evidenciaram que, ainda dentro da barriga da mãe, o feto pode sofrer restrições de crescimento, influenciado pelo excesso de peso paterno, não atingindo o seu potencial genético de crescimento. Basicamente, a exposição paterna aos chamados estressores ambientais no período antes da fecundação, como alimentação , prática de atividade física e tabagismo , por exemplo, pode levar a alterações no metabolismo dos filhos por meio de alterações epigenéticas. “O que se sabe até agora é que esses estressores ambientais, como o excesso de peso, por exemplo, podem influenciar a estrutura e qualidade dos espermatozoides alterando as expressões gênicas e influenciando o DNA do filho. Essa influência está relacionada à epigenética, área da ciência que estuda como estímulos ambientais podem ativar ou silenciar genes”, explica Carvalho. “É claro que a mãe é um ponto fundamental e, inclusive, os estudos mostram a importância do cuidado nutricional da gestante. Mas é preciso jogar luz sobre a questão do excesso de peso paterno no período pré-concepção. Os resultados mostram que, assim como é importante o aconselhamento nutricional materno, os pais também precisam mudar hábitos antes da concepção”, afirma a pesquisadora. O estudo realizado com os 89 pais e filhos ainda constatou que, quanto maior o IMC e a circunferência de cintura paternas, menor a circunferência cefálica do recém-nascido. “Não identificamos nenhuma anomalia ou má-formação, mas é uma correlação importante, já que a circunferência cefálica do bebê é um parâmetro relevante de crescimento. No entanto, ainda precisamos de novos estudos para avaliar o real significado desse achado”, afirma Carvalho. Estudos anteriores sobre obesidade, acrescenta, identificaram que o excesso de peso pode influenciar a deposição mineral óssea do recém-nascido. “Ressaltamos que neste estudo há uma limitação: não tivemos acesso à informação de quanto tempo as mulheres ficaram em trabalho de parto (em caso de parto vaginal). E sabemos que a circunferência cefálica logo após o nascimento pode ser alterada temporariamente quando o bebê ficou muito tempo no canal vaginal”, conta.

    "text": "Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Thursday said that peace would be impossible as long as Armenia’s Declaration of Independence calls for the unification of Armenia and Artsakh. The prime minister’s comments come on the heels of President Ilham Aliyev demanding changes to Armenia’s Constitution.\n“We will never have peace if the Declaration of Independence contains a decision to unify Artsakh and the Republic of Armenia,” Pashinyan told the Armenian Public Radio during an interview on Thursday.\nArmenia’s independence declaration was adopted in 1990 and contained the imperative to unify Armenia and Artsakh. That sentiment is also echoed in Armenia’s Constitution.\nOn the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in August, Pashianyan criticized the document, saying it sows enmity and war.\nDuring the interview, he also reiterated the need to adopt a new constitution while acknowledging that a reform process is currently underway, with a special commission tasked to represent amendment to the Constitution.\nHe said that a new constitution will go a long way to address what he called a “gap between the citizens and the state.”\nPashinyan said that such a gap existed because the Armenian Constitution, which was adopted in 1995 — and modified thereafter — “was never adopted under conditions and an environment where the citizen of the Republic of Armenia could say: ‘I went, voted, and adopted the Constitution.’ In other words: ‘I went and recorded my agreement with other citizens and the state, that we relate to each other this way and live this way.’”\nHe claimed that a constitutional referendum will allow citizens of Armenia to exercise their “own free will, without coercion, without falsification, without manipulation, and established the agreement.”\nPashinyan emphasized the importance of the Constitution having an organic connection with the people.\n“The organic connection with the people is not only expressed by the fact that we have to discuss, understand all the nuances, and remove all the formulations. The text of the constitution is mostly a matter for professional discussion and wording to serve the political guidelines, but the organic link with the state — the organic link with the people — is formed from the moment when the people accept and confirm this condition, and record that they are ‘a state people’ and record that within the borders of this state, we will relate to each other according to these rules,” said Pashinyan.\nPashinyan also emphasized that the government cannot change the Constitution.\n“The government can propose to the people, engage in discussions with the people, present its explanations to the people, and only the people can make that decision,” said Pashinyan.",

    "text": "Visual Abstract Abstract 177Lu-PSMA-617 (LuPSMA) is a newly established treatment for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but survival outcomes vary widely, and predictors of treatment responses are needed. This study investigated the role of total tumor volumes (TTVs) and new lesions (NLs) determined by LuPSMA SPECT/CT in early cycles to predict subsequent outcomes in a real-world practice setting. Methods: Between June and December 2022, consecutive patients with mCRPC who received at least 2 administrations of LuPSMA with SPECT/CT 24 h after treatment were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated associations between TTVs and the appearance of NLs at cycles 2 and 3 with subsequent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) using multivariate Cox regression. All analyses were adjusted for changes in PSA level relative to baseline. Results: Sixty-six mCRPC patients (median age, 74 y) received a median of 4 (interquartile range, 3–5) cycles of LuPSMA. Median follow-up starting at cycle 2 was 42 wk (interquartile range, 33–48 wk), with 24 of 66 patients deceased at the time of the analysis. Changes in TTV measured at the start of cycles 2 and 3 relative to baseline correlated significantly with corresponding changes in PSA level (r = 0.55 and 0.56), but absolute TTVs did not correlate significantly (r = 0.00 and 0.18). Patients with a higher absolute TTV at the start of cycle 2 had worse PSA progression-free survival and OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1–1.8] and 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5–2.9]), with consistent results at the start of cycle 3 (HR, 2 [95% CI, 1.4–2.9] and 2 [95% CI, 1.2–3.2]). NLs were identified in 13 of 66 and 11 of 51 patients at the start of cycles 2 and 3. NLs at the start of cycle 2 were associated with worse OS (HR, 5.8 [95% CI, 1.9–17.5]), with consistent results at the start of cycle 3 (HR, 4.9 [95% CI, 1.3–18.6]). In multivariate analysis, a higher TTV and the appearance of NLs at the start of cycles 2 and 3 were independently associated with poorer OS. Conclusion: Higher TTVs and NLs on LuPSMA SPECT/CT at the start of cycles 2 and 3 were independently associated with higher risk of death. These measures provided prognostic information independent of changes in PSA. Development of prognostic and predictive models including TTV, NLs, and PSA changes is warranted.

    "title": "Retirees: 2 Great Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy for Passive Income in 2024",
    "text": "Canadian seniors are searching for ways to squeeze more passive income out of their savings to help offset rising living costs. One popular strategy to achieve the goal is to own top\nTSX dividend-growth stocks inside a self-directed Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).\nEnbridge\nEnbridge (\nTSX:ENB) is a major player in the North American energy infrastructure industry. The company’s networks of oil and natural gas pipelines move 30% of the oil produced in the U.S. and Canada and 20% of the natural gas used in the United States. In recent years, Enbridge has focused its growth investments on other segments, including oil exports, natural gas exports, natural gas utilities, and renewable energy. For example, the company recently announced a US$14 billion deal to buy three natural gas utilities in the United States.\nEnbridge stock trades below $48 at the time of writing compared to $59 at one point in 2022.\nThe drop looks overdone. Enbridge’s assets have performed well in 2023, and the company expects the new acquisitions and the ongoing capital program to generate revenue and cash flow growth in the next few years.\nEnbridge raised the dividend by 3.1% for 2024. This is the 29th consecutive annual dividend hike. Investors who buy at the current price can get a 7.7% dividend yield.\nBCE\nBCE (\nTSX:BCE) is another top Canadian dividend stock that looks oversold and offers a great yield. The share price is down to about $51.50 at the time of writing compared to $65 earlier this year. High interest rates are driving up borrowing costs for BCE. As with Enbridge, the company has a large capital program and uses debt to finance part of the overall investments. A jump in borrowing expenses will contribute to a small drop in profits in 2023. Weak ad sales in the media business will also put some pressure on earnings.\nThat being said, BCE still expects to generate higher total revenue and better free cash flow in 2023 than it did last year. This should provide support for the dividend in 2024. BCE raised the payout by at least 5% in each of the past 15 years. Investors who buy BCE stock at the current price can get a 7.5% dividend yield.\nThe bottom line on top stocks for passive income\nOngoing volatility in the market should be expected, and further downside is possible in the next few months. That being said, Enbridge and BCE are leaders in their respective industries and pay attractive dividends that should continue to grow. If you have some cash to put to work in a TFSA focused on passive income, these stocks already look cheap and deserve to be on your radar.",
