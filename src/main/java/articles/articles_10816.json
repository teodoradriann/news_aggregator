    "text": "Widow of slain Sheriff's Deputy Josh Owen asks Tim Walz not to attend husband's funeral: 'You have never been a supporter of the police' Shannon Owen asked the Minnesota governor and Democratic vice presidential candidate to stay away from the funeral of her husband, who was killed in the line of duty. Shannon Owen, the widow of Pope County, Minn., Sheriff's Deputy [Josh Owen](http://www.swiftcountymonitor.com/pope-county-deputy-josh-owen-killed-line-duty), asked Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, to stay away from her husband's funeral, who was killed in the line of duty. In a phone call reported by [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/24/widow-police-officer-killed-tim-walz-not-welcome-funeral/), Owen warned the governor that if he attempted to attend, he would be escorted from the premises. The woman expressed her disapproval of Walz's lack of support for the police, especially in the wake of reforms the governor pushed for and endorsed after the death of felon George Floyd in 2020: \"You have never been a supporter of the police and I’d just appreciate it if you just don’t come anywhere near my town.\" At the words, Walz responded with a shocked tone, \"No, I totally understand and respect your rights. Our officers are here to support you in any way you need.\" After that, he abruptly ended the call. Owen frustrated with progressive police reform Sheriff's Deputy Josh Owen was killed on duty while responding to a domestic violence call. During the arrest, the suspect pulled out a concealed weapon and opened fire, shooting Owen four times. The first bullet was fatal, piercing his heart and both lungs. Shannon Owen recounted her husband's farewell on the day he was killed. It was 7 p.m. when he left to answer a call for backup. She and her 10-year-old son, Rylan, gave him a hug goodbye. \"Thank God we did.\" Owen, a National Guard veteran with two years of service in Iraq, had been considering leaving the force before his death, upset about the working conditions. His wife claims he was frustrated with police reforms pushed in Minnesota after the waves of vandalism in Minneapolis in 2020 after the death of Floyd. Shannon Owen said that Walz had been \"disrespecting\" the police. She said Josh himself would never have wanted Walz's presence at his funeral, given the resentment he felt toward the governor's policies. The crisis of confidence in the police With violent protests carried out by criminals, Minnesota became the epicenter of a crisis over policing and race. The destructive demonstrations that rocked the state in the days following Floyd's death led to a wave of riots and looting. Walz pushed for reforms after the criminal's death that included banning techniques such as chokeholds, requiring officers to intervene if they saw excessive use of force by fellow officers and creating a database on police misconduct. However, these measures had negative results, leaving the state with high rates of violent crime due to officers being unable to do their jobs effectively. Minneapolis, once home to one of the largest police forces in the region, has seen a dramatic decline in the number of officers since 2020, with a loss of more than 40% of its staff. In the past 12 months, five first responders have been killed in Minnesota, including four police officers and one firefighter-EMT. A police chief in Minnesota, who spoke on condition of anonymity, summed up the general sentiment among law enforcement: \"[Walz] doesn't have our support.\"",

    "title": "13 Signs of a Healthy Relationship, According to Therapists",
    "text": "Relationships take work and if you’ve found yourself putting in overtime lately to make things smooth, it’s understandable to wonder about the signs of a healthy relationship.\nIt’s important to note this upfront: Relationship experts stress that conflict is normal at some point in a relationship, and that no one sails through without the odd disagreement with their partner. “We cannot ever be in perfect sync with someone,” says Ramani Durvasula, Ph.D., author of\nShould I Stay or Should I Go?.\nLicensed clinical psychologist\nJuanita Guerra, Ph.D., agrees. “It is literally impossible for one partner in a relationship to always know and fully comprehend the other’s needs, wants, and desires,” she says. In fact, Durvasula says that having a “perfect” relationship would be a “tragedy.” “Relationships grow because they are tested, because we aren’t perfect, because we are always figuring it out,” she says.\nThat said, having a healthy relationship is important. “Having a healthy relationship makes us happier and has a positive impact on our mental and physical well-being,” Guerra says. “A healthy relationship can also provide a supportive and nurturing foundation that helps us to grow, flourish, and expand in every way.”\nMeet the experts: Ramani Durvasula, Ph.D., is author of\nShould I Stay or Should I Go?; Juanita Guerra, Ph.D., is a licensed clinical psychologist; Lesli Doares, L.M.F.T., is author of Blueprint for a Lasting Marriage.\nWhether you’re looking for reassurance after going through a rough patch or want to make sure you know what to look for while you’re out there, experts say these are the hallmarks of a healthy relationship.\nRespect\nThis is a crucial element, says Lesli Doares, L.M.F.T., author of\nBlueprint for a Lasting Marriage. “Respect is accepting each other as the unique individuals you both are,” she explains. “You honor each other’s qualities, experiences, and opinions as equally valid as your own.”\nDurvasula agrees. “Respect relates to being seen, valued, and heard,” she says.\nEarned trust\nEarned trust means that a couple has spent time together and learned that they can rely on each other. “Trust fosters safety” within the relationship, Durvasula says. Respect is also “foundational” to trust, she adds.\n“Trust is really about you knowing you can handle whatever happens,” Doares says.\nBeing able to communicate\nThis includes during tough times, Durvasula says. “Being able to communicate clearly, respectfully, and share feelings—especially when it is uncomfortable—can keep the relationship growing,” she says. That means you’re able to talk things out, even when you don’t agree with each other.\nAgreeing to disagree\nArguments and disagreements are practically inevitable with relationships. But healthy couples are able to recognize that they won’t agree on everything—and then move forward, Doares says.\n“Two-thirds of all disagreements in a marriage can and do go unresolved,” she says. “That’s how common agreeing to disagree is.” It’s also a life skill to accept differences of opinion, Doares says. “Figuring out why it is so hard that your partner might not agree with you is a process worth doing,” she adds.\nForgiveness\nBlind forgiveness isn’t helpful, but forgiving your partner when it will lead to a change in behavior and accountability “can foster growth,” Durvasula says.\n“Forgiveness means you are choosing to no longer let the hard emotions run your life,” Doares says. That goes both ways, though. “Being able to forgive goes hand-in-hand with being able to give and receive effective apologies,” Doares says. “But when you are able to own your mistakes and make a real effort to change the behavior, you should not be forever held accountable for things done in the past and no longer repeated.”\nCommitment\nCommitment is a cornerstone of relationships, although it can look different for everyone. That’s why it’s important to ensure you and your partner are on the same page about how committed you are to the relationship. “Commitment is how you each can feel safe,” Doares says. “It’s not about ‘anything goes’ in terms of your or your partner’s behavior, but it’s about feeling like it’s safe to be yourself.”\nKindness\nKindness can include little things, like picking up your partner’s favorite ice cream at the grocery store, or bigger gestures, like dropping everything to help when they need you.\n“Kindness is another relationship skill, as well as being a good human,” Doares says. “There is never a reason to be anything less than kind to each other.” Doares recommends keeping this in mind, too: “You can never unhear harshness, even if there has been an apology. It’s better to never say harsh things in the first place.”\nBeing independent within the relationship\nYou and your partner don’t need to do everything together, and it’s important for you to do your own thing sometimes, Durvasula says. “Healthy relationships are able to achieve that balancing act of individuation and autonomy without a sense of insecurity,” she says.\nBeing a part of a relationship doesn’t mean giving up on yourself, Doares says. “Yes, you have to be willing to make some adjustments, whether that’s time, quantity, or something else,” she says. “But giving up what feeds you, what makes you feel good about yourself, is never necessary.”\nDoing things on your own or with family and friends can help give you and your partner things to talk about, too, Doares says.\nBeing comfortable together\nThis doesn’t necessarily happen right away, but you should feel like you can be yourself with your partner over time. “Shared values and time together build connective tissue,” Durvasula says.\nThis level of comfort also means that you trust that you’ll still be there for each other after off days. “You should bring your best to your relationship but that ‘best’’ may change from day to day,” Doares says. “This goes back to a sense of safety and support: You shouldn’t have to wear a mask or worry about letting your partner down if you’re having an off day.”\nEnjoying each other’s company\nIt’s usually what brings people together and can often keep people together. “Continuing to do things together keeps your relationship growing,” Doares says. “Experiencing new things together releases the same neurotransmitters that are part of the falling in love process.”\nSpending time together also allows you to experience new things together, and “newness keeps the love alive,” Doares says.\n“As time goes on, it’s easy to let other things get in the way,” Doares says. “But if you want your relationship to last, you need to spend time on it.”\nSupporting goals\nIn a perfect world, you and your partner are each other’s biggest cheerleaders. “Having your partner in your corner makes it easier to deal with any challenges your goals present to you,” Doares says. When you can create goals together, that’s even better. “Setting compatible goals is the way to keep your relationship on track,” Doares says.\nMaking decisions together\nJoint decisions are inevitable for couples, whether it’s on where to live, how to raise kids, or whether to make a big investment. “Joint decision-making underlies balance and equity that are so important in a relationship and are also predicated on respect,” Durvasula says.\nDoares suggests being mindful of this: “Every decision either of you make influences the other person, either directly or indirectly.”\nBeing able to have tough conversations\nTough conversations are bound to come up, and it’s important to have them, even if you don’t want to. “If you can’t talk about something, you can’t resolve it,” Doares says. “Putting off hard conversations just makes them harder when they do come up.”\nAvoiding tough conversations can also make them come up in inapprorpriate ways or when you’re caught off-guard, Doares says.",

    "text": "EL PARTIDAZO DE COPE El plan que el Atlético de Madrid impone a Joao Félix: o sale vendido o se queda Pedro Morata desveló en El Partidazo de COPE la intención que tiene el club rojiblanco con Joao Félix antes de volver al trabajo a las órdenes de Simeone. Tiempo de lectura: 3' Actualizado 01:22 Un camino con subidas y bajadas. Joao Félix aterrizó en el Atlético de Madrid en el verano de 2019 por 127,2 millones de euros. Con 19 años, se convirtió en el fichaje más caro de la historia rojiblanca y firmó por nueve temporadas. Desde las oficinas del club se esperaba que la nueva incorporación se convirtiera en una de las estrellas del equipo, pero la historia fue distinta. Con el paso de los partidos, Joao fue perdiendo importancia y se convirtió en un habitual en el banquillo de Simeone. En busca de salida En las oficinas del Atlético de Madrid ya trabajan para buscar una solución que ponga fin a la situación que atraviesa el portugués. Según informa Pedro Morata en El Partidazo de COPE, el club no quiere ceder al futbolista ya que tienen 45 millones pendientes de amortización y es la cantidad que quieren cobrar para traspasarle definitivamente. Se trata de la misma postura que mantenían desde las oficinas el año pasado cuando se terminó aceptando la cesión al FC Barcelona. ?? Informa— El Partidazo de COPE (@partidazocope) [@pedro_morata] ?? \"La idea del Atlético de Madrid es vender a Joao Felix este verano. Si no lo venden, la intención es que se quede. No se plantean, en este momento, una cesión\" \"El Aston Villa de Emery lo quiere, pero cedido\" ?? [#PartidazoCOPE] [pic.twitter.com/LTTVdlzuOL] [July 25, 2024] Por el momento, dos son los equipos interesados en hacerse con los servicios del jugador, aunque el Atlético de Madrid ha dicho 'no' a ambas opciones. Por un lado, el Aston Villa de Unai Emery querría la cesión del portugués y por otro lado, el Benfica estaría dispuesto a comprar, aunque solo puede acceder al 50%. Los altos cargos colchoneros son contundentes: el jugador es vendido o se queda en la primera plantilla del equipo. Nuevas experiencias En el mercado de invierno de 2023 y ante la falta de minutos, el jugador tomó una decisión: hacer las maletas y coger un avión rumbo a Chelsea en busca de confianza y minutos. En su primer partido le expulsaron con roja directa, perdiéndose los tres siguientes. Aunque mantuvo la titularidad durante varios encuentros, terminó cayendo al banquillo. Los números conseguidos fueron muy pobres, tan solo tres goles y suplente habitual en el equipo de Franck Lampard. Pochettino sustituyó a Lampard en el banquillo de Stamford Bridge y a pesar de confiar en él, la falta de respuesta por parte del futbolista portugués provocó que el técnico argentino también le apartase de sus planes. - Left6:No existe configuración de publicidad para el slot solicitado En su vuelta al Metropolitano y tras un verano con bastantes polémicas entorno a la actitud del futbolista y las malas relaciones dentro del vestuario se tomaron medidas. Simeone no contaba con el Menino de Ouro y él quería salir, en aquellos momentos apareció otro equipo de la competición española interesado en sus servicios, el FC Barcelona. El equipo de Xavi insistió en la cesión y se hizo cargo dela ficha del jugador durante la temporada 2023/2024. La ley del 'ex' A pesar de los pocos minutos disputados con el FC Barcelona, tuvo una víctima perfecta cuando vistió la camiseta blaugrana: el Atlético de Madrid. El delantero anotó diez goles a lo largo de toda la temporada, siete en La Liga y dos de ellos fue al equipo rojiblanco. Uno sirvió a los blaugranas para conseguir los tres puntos en el Camp Nou y el otro abrió la lata de la goleada del FC Barcelona en el Cívitas Metropolitano. En total, únicamente ha acumulado 2.000 minutos entre las distintas competiciones de Liga, Champions League, Copa del Rey y Supercopa de España. Tal ha sido su pérdida de importancia que su valor de mercado se sitúa alrededor de los 30 millones de euros en la actualidad. Sin embargo, sigue siendo la mayor inversión de la historia del Atlético y no quieren regalar al futbolista. Joao Félix está llamado a incorporarse hoy 26 de julio a la pretemporada rojiblanca mientras se le agota el tiempo para encontrar una solución, otro período estival más, a su futuro.

    "text": "Man bear sprays carjackers to protect his 72-year-old mother, Washington State Police say [Doc Louallen](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7686036002/doc-louallen/) A Washington man used bear spray to fend off two attackers who attempted to carjack his elderly mother on Tuesday, bringing an end to a crime spree that included multiple carjackings and police chases, authorities said. \"One of the suspects tried taking the elderly lady out of the driver seat but the woman made it hard for him to close the door,\" said Washington State Patrol Trooper Rick Johnson. \"Her son, who was parked next to her, came around and sprayed bear mace.\" The woman's son [told KOMO News](https://komonews.com/news/local/bear-spray-thwarts-post-christmas-carjacking-at-sea-tac-rest-area-by-2-suspects-on-the-run-stolen-vehicle-i-5-police-washington-state-patrol-troopers-james-crime-protection-chelsea-dehart-criminal-holidays) he tried to stop a suspect by spraying him in the face with bear spray, but it didn't initially seem to phase the man. After it didn't work, the suspect got inside the victim's car but was unable to drive away because the victim had the keys in his pocket, according to investigators. \"His face was all red and he was crying,\" the man told KOMO News. \"His girlfriend asked me what I sprayed with and I sprayed her in the face, too.\" The two suspects, believed to be a man and a woman in their 30s, were arrested as Federal Way police arrived at the scene, KOMO News reported. The suspects face charges of eluding police, carjacking, and hit and run, according Johnson. Moments before the suspects were arrested According to the investigators, two suspects were eluding Kent police in a stolen vehicle driving northbound on Interstate 5. After a short time chasing after the stolen car, Kent police stopped their pursuit due to strict laws in Washington about officers in high-speed chases. Kent police officers reported the suspects hit multiple cars as they were escaping. The suspects lost control of their vehicle and stopped at a rest area off I-5 in Federal Way, nearly 8 miles north of their first encounter with Kent police. The suspects tried to break into three cars while at the rest stop, state investigators said. One of the suspects opened 72-year-old woman's car door, leading to the bear spray encounter. Investigators said none of the victims suffered serious injuries as the suspects tried stealing the cars. \"I never thought something like this would happen to me, you see stuff all the time,\" the woman's son told KOMO News, \"He's lucky I had bear spray otherwise I would have knocked him to the ground.\"",

    "text": "MÁLAGA, 3 (EUROPA PRESS)\nEl Ayuntamiento de Málaga, ante la previsión de lluvias para el próximo domingo, ha descartado un posible adelanto al sábado 4 de enero de las cabalgatas de Reyes Magos que tradicionalmente se suceden en los distritos de la ciudad el día previo a la festividad del 6 de enero. Este próximo sábado se tomará la decisión de un posible adelanto del horario de la cabalgata del domingo, previsto inicialmente para las 18,00 horas.\n\"Ya se está trabajando en distintas alternativas y, por supuesto, saldremos, y se tomará la decisión con toda la seguridad que se deba de tener, si no, pues no saldremos. También lo tenemos claro\", ha señalado este viernes en rueda de prensa la concejala Teresa Porras.\nLa edil ha dicho que es \"imposible\" trasladar la cabalgata al sábado día 4; y ha señalado que la previsión es que la lluvia llegue el domingo por la tarde.\n\"Todo depende de lo que dé el tiempo. Lo tendremos mañana --en referencia a este próximo sábado--, seguro. Y mañana se tendrá que tomar una decisión porque, bueno, son muchos factores que hay que encajar. Y ya se está trabajando, pero bueno, hay que encajar a muchas cosas y habrá que hacer trabajo incluso hasta por la noche si se decide al final qué se hace por la mañana\", ha dicho.\nEn vista de esta situación la capital malagueña se podría sumar a decisiones como la tomada por el Ayuntamiento de Alhaurín de la Torre, que ha confirmado que mantiene la cabalgata de Reyes Magos el domingo 5 de enero, si bien se celebrará en horario de mañana (desde las 11.00 horas) en lugar de desde las 17.00 horas como estaba previsto en un principio.\nCabe recordar que otros ayuntamientos de la provincia como los de Antequera, Estepona, Marbella, Mijas, Torremolinos y Nerja ya han anunciado que celebrarán sus cabalgatas el sábado 4 de enero debido a la previsión de lluvias para el domingo.\n(((HABRÁ AMPLIACIÓN)))",

    "title": "Pwn2Own 2024: Tesla Hacks, Dozens of Zero-Days in Electrical Vehicles",
    "text": "In just two days at Pwn2Own 2024 in Tokyo, researchers have compromised a bevy of electric vehicle chargers, operating systems, Tesla components, and unearthed dozens of zero-day vulnerabilities along the way.\nLast year's Pwn2Own in Vancouver flirted with cars as an attack surface, adding Teslas into the mix alongside competitions to hack more traditional servers, enterprise applications, browsers, and the like. But this year's event went full pedal to the metal, and the results have been enlightening. On the first day alone, contestants demonstrated 24 unique zero-days, earning them $722,500 in winnings. Day two saw 20 new exploits, and the final, third day promises nine more still.\n\"Vehicles are increasingly becoming a complex system of systems,\" says Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness for Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), the group hosting the event. \"There hasn't been a lot of research into this area in the past, and based on our experience, that lack of external scrutiny means there could be a lot of security issues.\"\nHacking Into Teslas The headline-grabbing event at last year's Pwn2Own was when a team from Toulouse-based Synacktiv managed to breach a Tesla Model 3 in under two minutes .\nThis year, Synacktiv has returned with exploits of the Ubiquiti Connect and JuiceBox 40 Smart EV charging stations, the ChargePoint Home Flex (an at-home EV charging tool), and the self-explanatory Automotive Grade Linux. Its most notable achievements, though, have been a three-bug exploit chain against Tesla's modem, and a two-bug chain against its infotainment system, each earning a $100,000 cash prize.\nAccording to the rules of the event, vendors have 90 days to remediate their security flaws before they're allowed to be publicly disclosed. But in an email from Tokyo, the Synacktiv crackers gave Dark Reading a high-level overview of what the attacks looked like:\n\"The attack is sent from a GSM antenna emulating a fake BTS (rogue telecom operator). A first vulnerability gives root access to the modem card of the Tesla,\" they wrote. \"A second attack jumps from the modem to the infotainment system. And bypassing the security features on this process, it's possible to access multiple equipment on the car such as the headlights, the windshield wipers, or to open the trunk and the doors.\"\nWith Teslas, says Synacktiv CEO Renaud Feil, \"it's a two-sided coin. It's a car that has a huge attack surface — everything is IT in a Tesla. But they also have a strong security team and they try to pay a lot of attention to security. So it's a huge target, but it's a difficult target.\"\nModern Cars at a Crossroads \"The attack surface of the car it's growing, and it's getting more and more interesting, because manufacturers are adding wireless connectivities, and applications that allow you to access the car remotely over the Internet,\" Feil says.\nKen Tindell, chief technology officer of Canis Automotive Labs, seconds the point. \"What is really interesting is how so much reuse of mainstream computing in cars brings along all the security problems of mainstream computing into cars.\"\n\"Cars have had this two worlds thing for at least 20 years,\" he explains. First, \"you've got mainstream computing (done not very well) in the infotainment system. We've had this in cars for a while, and it's been the source of a huge number of vulnerabilities — in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and so on. And then you've got the control electronics, and the two are very separate domains. Of course, you get problems when that infotainment then starts to touch the CAN bus that's talking to the brakes, headlights, and stuff like that.\"\nIt's a conundrum that should be familiar to OT practitioners: managing IT equipment alongside safety-critical machinery, in such a way that the two can work together without spreading the former's nuisances to the latter. And, of course, the disparate product life cycles between IT and OT tech — cars lasting far longer than, say, laptops — which only serves to make the gap even less wieldy.\nWhat Car Security Might Look Like For an image of where vehicle cybersecurity is going, one might start at infotainment — the biggest, most obvious attack surface in cars today. Here, there have been two schools of thought developing.\n\"One is: Let's just not bother, because you'll never keep up considering the product cycles in cars. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — that is the way forward. So the car manufacturer provides a screen, and then your phone provides the infotainment stuff,\" Tindell explains. \"I think that's a good approach, because your phone clearly is your responsibility, Apple keeps it up to date, it's all patched, and then your car is just providing a screen.\"\n\"The other school of thought is to let these big companies take control of the key functions of your cars. License an operating system from Google, and now it's the Google CarPlay equivalent, but directly wired into the car,\" he says. With a company like Google in charge, \"there is an update mechanism for it, just like it updates their Pixel phones. The question is, in 10 years time, are you still going to get updates for your car once Google gets bored and tries to shut it down?\"\nBut even if manufacturers do manage to squeeze one part of the attack surface (unlikely) or outsource the responsibility of overseeing it to third parties (imperfectly), Pwn2Own 2024 has demonstrated that they'll still have vastly more problems yet to account for: EV chargers to modems, operating systems, and more.\nWhere the Industry Has to Go To Tindell, what's really important is to keep the mainstream computing firewalled off from the control systems, so that there's a choke point. \"Unfortunately, some of the choke points so far haven't been very well-developed, and you can crack them on the end of a chain of exploits,\" he adds.\n\"I think they know what to do,\" Synacktiv's Feil says. \"It's the same process that applies to the rest of the IT industry: invest in cybersecurity, do some audits, hack your stuff until it gets very hard to hack.\"\nGetting manufacturers to that point, he believes, might require some outside intervention. \"The industry has been able to push back to restrict regulation,\" Feil says. \"Their narrative is: We are having a tough time, because everyone is asking us to switch to electric cars, and it may affect our bottom line heavily. But they must show that they are doing something when it comes to cybersecurity.\"",
