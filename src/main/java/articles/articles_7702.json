And while they usually form around artificial lights, pillars can also form in the presence of natural sources, like the moon.\nSun dogs come out to play Beautiful sundogs on this chilly Thursday.#Winnipeg #photography #mbstorm pic.twitter.com/wmRV5XJhnS\nBeautiful sundogs on this chilly Thursday.

You're most likely to see them when the sun is near the horizon and temperatures dip below freezing.\nCold weather experiments Click here to view the video\nSome of our viewers took the opportunity to have some fun in the cold.\nA video uploaded to The Weather Network by Wina Cameron-Reid features one of our favourite cold weather tricks.\nThe video was shot in Parkland Beach, Alta, while temperatures dipped below the -40-mark. At those frigid temperatures, boiling water quickly turns into ice and snow when thrown into the air.\nThis trick will work anytime the temperature dips to -30°C.\nWe also received this stunning photo of a frozen bubble, photographed by Jannie Haar in Bow Island, Alta, on Wednesday:\nUGC - frozen bubble (Jannie Haar)\nThe caption?\n\"It's cold on the Prairies.\"\nIt certainly is.\nHeader image: Submitted to The Weather Network by Faye Campbell)\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "As we stand on the cusp of 2024, can you feel that sense of fresh beginnings in the air? I recently had a heartwarming chat on our show with the Feng Shui Master, Hanz Cua. His energetic guidance on how to infuse our lives and homes with positive vibes for the upcoming year truly resonated with me, and I'm eager to share these nuggets of wisdom with you!\nAccording to the master himself, here are some of what we can do at home, with family, and for ourselves to nudge favor our way for 2024.\nAt home Picture your home as a canvas of positivity. Master Hanz encourages us to keep our spaces well-lit, not just for brightness but to welcome good energy into every nook and cranny. So, if there's a dim corner that needs attention, let's give it some love!\nLook out for faulty light sources and make sure rooms are all well-lit as your household greets the new year. Image by sergei akulich from Pixabay Now, let's talk about kitchen magic! The heart of our homes deserves some Feng Shui love too. A tidy kitchen isn't just pleasing to the eye. It's believed to stir up some wonderful vibes for the entire family. So, let's keep those countertops sparkling, and even our cookware clean.\nOh, and speaking of cozy comforts, when was the last time you treated yourself to fresh bed linens? There's nothing quite like slipping into a bed that feels like a cloud, especially as we dream our way into the new year.\nAnd while we’re at it, be on the lookout for leaky faucets—don’t let these eventually wash away good fortune!\nDon’t let leaky faucets drain away your fortune! Image by Rudy and Peter Skitterians from Pixabay New Year celebrations are already ingrained in Filipino tradition. But it's still worth remembering to have 12 kinds of different fruits in your Media Noche spread. Did you know that these don't have to be round-shaped? Master Hanz pointed out that it can be any shape, as long as you have 12 different kinds, for good fortune throughout every month in the next year. Here's an additional tip: include a kiat-kiat (clementine or mandarin orange) in your selection—read on to find out why!\nThe kiat-kiat serves two purposes on New Year’s Eve in making your fortune sweeter. Image by Rudy and Peter Skitterians from Pixabay One more important tip for preparing your home for 2024: the activity of general cleaning is highly favored for good feng shui! Declutter, clean up, and get ready for a prosperous new year!\nWith family Family, as we know, is where the heart is. During our conversation, it warmed my heart to hear Master Hanz's insights on family traditions resounded with mine. To start, doing activities together is highly encouraged.\nChristmas and New Year’s eve dinners are our family’s age-old tradition. This includes praying together. If we do it with both gratitude and hope in our hearts, it becomes a beautiful way to wrap up the year and step into the new one with hope and togetherness. And let's not forget the joy of reconciling and letting go of any lingering misunderstandings. After all, forgiveness is a gift we give ourselves as much as others.\nNow, onto the delicious part - our Media Noche feast! The best dishes to include, according to Hanz, are those with symbolisms we want to embrace – from pancit’s and noodle’s longevity, to the prosperity of tikoy, each dish carries its own tale of tradition and hope.\nDifferent dishes carry distinct symbolisms—which ones are you ready to embrace in 2024? And as the clock's hands draw close to midnight, let's sprinkle our doorsteps with coins and kiat-kiats. It's like sending out a heartfelt invitation to prosperity and joy!\nOn ourselves As we wrap up, let's all try to greet 2024 with thankful hearts and spirits ready to embrace good fortune. Because while Feng Shui offers us gentle nudges towards harmony and abundance, it's our spirit, love, and actions that truly shape our destiny. At the same, there’s nothing to lose with inviting luck our way through fulfilling activities. Let’s root for a bright and lucky year!\nI'm bubbling with excitement for the adventures that await in 2024. Together, with our shared stories, lessons, and dreams, let's make it a year to remember. Here's to love, laughter, and a touch of Feng Shui magic!\nWatch the interview below!\n__\nYou can follow my social media accounts: Instagram , Facebook , YouTube , Tiktok , Twitter and Kumu .

    "title": "Midnight Meal Horror: Man Fatally Shot Outside Houston WingStop - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Midnight in northwest Houston turned deadly when an unidentified man was gunned down just steps from a bus stop after leaving the WingStop on West 34th Street near the North Freeway. According to the Houston Chronicle, the victim had exited the restaurant around 12:05 a.m. Wednesday when an assailant opened fire, striking him multiple times. Despite rapid response by Houston Police Department officers, the man was pronounced dead at the scene after being rushed to a nearby hospital. Detectives recovered fifteen shell casings scattered across the sidewalk and bus-stop plaza—a grim signature of the volley of shots fired toward the victim. Detective D. Hobson of HPD Homicide confirmed investigators are seeking a dark-colored sedan believed to have sped off moments after the shooting, but no arrests have been made as of Wednesday afternoon. Local digital-content producer Ahmed Humble of KPRC 2/Click2Houston reports that witnesses at the scene described a sudden burst of gunfire, followed by panicked screams and the sound of tires peeling away from the curb. “I heard at least eight or nine rounds—I thought it was fireworks,” recalled Maria Gonzalez, a nearby convenience-store clerk who asked that only her first name be used. “When I looked outside, I saw him fall near the bus bench. There was blood everywhere.” This eyewitness account marks one of the few direct on-the-ground observations in a case still shrouded in early-morning confusion. The shooting site sits along a stretch of West 34th that residents say suffers from inadequate lighting and limited foot traffic after dark. Community advocates have long pushed for enhanced pedestrian safety measures—calls that have grown more urgent following this latest tragedy. “People shouldn’t have to worry about walking to public transit,” said neighborhood association leader Jamal Thompson. “We need better streetlights, more patrols, and cameras to deter violence.” This incident is the third fatal shooting reported in the area in just over a week, fueling frustration among those who use the bus stop nightly to commute downtown. HPD urges anyone with information—particularly motorists who observed a dark sedan in the W. 34th Street corridor between midnight and 12:15 a.m.—to contact Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS. Video surveillance from nearby businesses and Metro bus cameras is also being reviewed for leads. As the investigation continues, the community grapples with another senseless loss and demands swift action to make their streets safe once more.",

    "text": "Связанные видео:\nВ условиях серьезного энергетического кризиса, который затрагивает кубинцев, разрушение трубопровода с искусственным газом усугубляет ситуацию для жителей двух муниципалитетов Гаваны, где будет приостановлена подача бытового топлива до замены поврежденного участка в ближайшие дни.\nКомпания Gas Manufacturado сообщила в этот среду в коммунике, что из-за аварийной ситуации будет заменен участок трубопровода на авеню 51, от 96 до 100, чтобы \"обеспечить стабильность газоснабжения в сети Плайя-Мариано\".\nЧтобы выполнить работы, будет проведена «полная остановка» производства №2 с 10 вечера следующей пятницы, 9 мая, до 4 утра субботы, 10 числа, что полностью затронет обслуживание в муниципалитетах Плайя и Мариано, указала организация.\nКомпания, связанная с государственной нефтяной компанией CUPET, извинилась перед пострадавшими, \"за неудобства, которые может причинить данное отключение\", и заверила, что сохраняет свое \"обязательство предоставлять качественные услуги своим клиентам\".\nПроблемы с обслуживанием синтетического газа в столице являются частью острого энергетического кризиса, который испытывает Куба, на который также влияют нехватка сжиженного газа по всей стране и постоянные и продолжительные отключения электроэнергии.\nВ конце апреля первый завод по производству газа (Melones) в Гаване приостановил услуги в районах Пласа-де-ла-Революсьон, Старая Гавана, Центр Гаваны, Серро и Диез-де-Октубре для проведения «неотложных» работ по обслуживанию. Уже за месяц до этого промышленность также объявила о другом неотложном остановке для «гарантии стабильности газа» в пяти районах.\nТем временем нехватка сжиженного газа продолжает ухудшать повседневную жизнь значительной части кубинского населения, и государство не предлагает решения для многомесячного дефицита топлива.\nНа протяжении нескольких месяцев граждане вынуждены стоять в длинных очередях, пытаясь купить газ, ожидая часами или днями без успеха.\nБез каких-либо других альтернатив тысячам семей пришлось готовить на дровах и угле из-за нехватки основных видов топлива.\nМенее двух недель назад CUPET подтвердил, что нехватка сжиженного газа продолжается из-за нехватки поставок. “На данный момент ни один танкер со сжиженным газом не прибыл, и дефицит сохраняется на уровне страны”, заявила Базовая Предприятие по Распределению Топлива Камагуэя в официальном заявлении, распространенном специально для разъяснения путаницы, возникшей в социальных сетях.\nЧасто задаваемые вопросы о прекращении подачи газа в Гаване\nПочему будет прервано газоснабжение в двух муниципалитетах Гаваны?\nПрерывание поставок сжатого газа в муниципалитетах Плайя и Мариано связано с поломкой трубы. Предприятие по производству сжатого газа сообщило, что будет проведена \"полная остановка\" завода по производству №2 для замены поврежденного участка, с целью обеспечения стабильности обслуживания. Это является частью энергетического кризиса, который затрагивает Кубу, где нехватка сжиженного газа и отключения электричества являются обычным делом.\nСколько времени продлится отключение газоснабжения в Гаване?\nСлужба газоснабжения будет приостановлена с вечера пятницы, 9 мая, и ожидается, что она возобновится в madrugada субботы, 10 мая. Компания Gas Manufacturado предполагает, что услуга будет восстановлена в ближайшие дни после замены поврежденного участка.\nКак энергетический кризис на Кубе влияет на граждан?\nЭнергетический кризис на Кубе вызвал множество проблем для населения, включая нехватку сжиженного газа и длительные отключения электричества. Граждане сталкиваются с длинными очередями, чтобы приобрести газ, и в условиях нехватки ресурсов многие вынуждены прибегать к альтернативным методам, таким как использование дров и угля для готовки. Эта ситуация ухудшила качество жизни и увеличила уровень разочарования среди кубинцев.\nКакие меры предпринимает Компания по производству газового топлива для решения сложившейся ситуации?\nКомпания по производству газов объявила, что заменит поврежденный участок трубопровода на авеню 51, чтобы гарантировать стабильность газоснабжения. Кроме того, они выразили свою приверженность предоставлению качественных услуг своим клиентам и принесли извинения за те неудобства, которые может вызвать прерывание обслуживания. Тем не менее, долгосрочное решение остается неопределенным из-за продолжающегося энергетического кризиса в стране.\nАрхивировано в:",

    "text": "Israel rejected global calls on Thursday for a ceasefire with the Hezbollah movement, defying its biggest ally the US and pressing ahead with strikes that have killed hundreds in Lebanon and heightened fears of an all-out regional war. An Israeli warplane struck the edges of the capital Beirut, killing two people and wounding 15, including a woman in critical condition, Lebanon's health ministry said. That took deaths from hits overnight and during Thursday to 28. The strike killed the head of one of Hezbollah's air force units, Mohammad Surur, two security sources said, the latest senior Hezbollah commander to be targeted in days of assassinations hitting the group's top ranks. On the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon, the army staged an exercise simulating a ground invasion - a potential next stage after relentless airstrikes and explosions of communications devices. Israel's air force is planning to assist troops in the event of a ground operation and will stop any arms transfers from Iran, Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar said. Israel has vowed to secure its north and return thousands of citizens to communities there who have evacuated since Hezbollah launched a campaign of cross-border strikes last year in solidarity with Palestinian resistance movement Hamas. Landing in the U.S. to address the UN General Assembly, Israeli, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters the military will keep hitting Hezbollah with \"full force and we will not stop until we achieve all our goals, first and foremost returning the residents of the north safely to their homes.\" Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes during the heaviest Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since a major war in 2006. The U.S., France and several other allies urged an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border. They also expressed support for a ceasefire in Gaza. The White House said that discussions are continuing for a 21-day ceasefire. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was scheduled to meet with Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. In London, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned there was a risk of all-out war in the Middle East, but a diplomatic solution was still possible. Israeli fighter jets also hit infrastructure on the Lebanese-Syrian border to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel's military said. The Lebanese health ministry said most victims on Thursday were Syrians killed in the town of Younine in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanon is home to around 1.5mn Syrians who fled civil war there. Hezbollah said in a statement it had struck the town of Kiryat Shmona in north Israel and an Israeli military northern command base, as well as using air defence weapons to force two Israeli warplanes back. In Beirut, thousands of Lebanese have sought shelter in schools. People and rescuers gather at the site of an Israeli airstrike that targeted an apartment on Al-Qaem street in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Thursday Volunteers work in a community kitchen to prepare meals for those who fled Israeli bombardment in southern Lebanon and found refuge in temporary shelters in Beirut, on Thursday",
