    "text": "Apple shares popped on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and the largest-ever stock buyback program. The iPhone maker announced on Thursday it would repurchase $110 billion of its shares, the biggest buyback in history. But overall sales decreased 4% and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year during the quarter. Apple shares popped more than 6% on Friday morning after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and the largest-ever stock buyback program. If the gains hold until the market closes, it will be the best day for Apple shares since Nov. 30, 2022.\nThe iPhone maker announced on Thursday it would repurchase $110 billion of its shares, the biggest buyback in U.S. history , surpassing Apple’s prior repurchases. The company posted earnings of $1.53 per share on revenue of $90.75 billion, exceeding analysts’ estimates of earnings of $1.50 per share on revenue of $90.01 billion, according to LSEG.\nBut overall sales decreased 4% and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year during the quarter, indicating flagging demand for the smartphone’s latest generation. Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that quarterly sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-earlier period.\nAnalysts at Bank of America reiterated their buy rating of Apple stock — calling it a top pick — and raised their price target to $230 from $225 in a Friday investor note, writing that they expect the company to roll out generative artificial intelligence features for the iPhone this year.\n“Apple is growing iPhones in Mainland China, estimate revisions are turning positive and GenAI features will drive a strong upgrade cycle,” they wrote.\nJPMorgan analysts, maintaining an overweight rating, lifted their price target for Apple to $225 from $210 on Thursday, pointing to “resilient” year-over-year iPhone revenues and “expectations of an upgrade cycle-led tailwind in iPads” ahead of Apple’s product launch event next week.\n“All in all, while modest revenue growth year-over-year might not be the ideal outcome,” they wrote, “it now provides visibility into higher revenue opportunities in the coming years with tailwinds from product cycles across hardware devices as well as an AI-led smartphone cycle further boosting growth.”\nMorgan Stanley analysts retained their overweight rating of Apple and hiked their price target to $216 from $210 on Friday, citing the company’s quarterly performance, year-over-year growth in iPhone shipments to China in March, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come.\n“It’s hard not to get more bullish here,” they wrote.\nCNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Source: Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson are heading to Martha’s Vineyard. While it is a preferred summer vacation spot for the Obamas, she’s heading there this time to record a live episode of her podcast, IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson.\nThey’ll be interviewing multihyphenate actress Teyana Taylor about her life and career during a live taping on August 9 at the Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival ( MV AAFF ) next month, according to Variety . Obama and her brother, Craig Robinson, launched the podcast in March and have interviewed guests including Angie Martinez, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Issa Rae, Keke Palmer, Bruce Springsteen, Jay Shetty, and Damon and Marlon Wayans.\nTheir most recent guest was Barack Obama, who discussed parenting and his work with the My Brother’s Keeper mentoring initiative. The couple also used the time to poke fun at the rumors that they were divorcing or estranged. “You took me back,” Barack joked. They also did the TikTok couple’s challenge, answering questions about their relationship.\n“IMO is a podcast that continues to shape culture with unfiltered perspectives and powerful storytelling,” a statement by MVAAFF founders Floyd and Stephanie Rance said. “The live taping also marks a major moment in the festival’s ongoing tradition of spotlighting Black excellence across media and the arts, with this year’s summer theme of joy!”\nTaylor’s new album Escape Room is coming on Aug. 22. She’s already released its first single, “Long Time,” in June. Her boyfriend, Rebel Ridge and Mufasa actor Aaron Pierre , makes a cameo.\nThe Obamas first came to the festival in 2022 to support their Netflix doc Descendant . It was produced by their Higher Ground production company, which is also behind IMO.\nOther celebs expected at this year’s festival include Debbie Allen, Spike Lee, Aldis Hodge, Devale Ellis, Tracee Ellis Ross, and ESPN host Ryan Clark.",

    "text": "Fidelity, a financial services company with $5.9 trillion in assets under management, has introduced new retirement accounts that will allow Americans to invest in crypto nearly fee-free.\nThe three accounts — a tax-deferred traditional IRA and two Roth IRAs (one is a rollover) — permit the buying and selling of Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), and Litecoin ( LTC ). While there are no fees to open or maintain the accounts, Fidelity charges a 1% spread on the execution price of crypto buy and sell transactions.\nThe crypto IRAs are offered by Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity that has traditionally offered institutional investors the opportunity to buy and sell crypto.\nThe broadening of its client base may be another signal of the changing crypto landscape in the United States, which has seen the adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and multiple companies, including stablecoin issuer Circle , filing for an initial public offering.\nFidelity states that, for security, it holds the majority of its crypto in cold storage, which consists of crypto wallets not connected to the internet .\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs for retirement planning: A beginner’s guide\nBTC and ETH exposure already offered for retirement accounts While the direct purchase of cryptocurrencies in an IRA has never been strictly prohibited, few IRA providers have allowed such purchases, according to Investopedia. Therefore, Fidelity’s new IRAs may signal a change in the environment.\nStill, for enthusiasts of BTC and ETH, there have been other options since 2024, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of those corresponding coins.\nSince the debut of those ETFs, investors in the US have been able to gain exposure to crypto markets from their retirement accounts — depending on the brokerage. There has also been the rise of Bitcoin IRAs , which are self-directed retirement accounts that offer tax advantages.\nSome crypto companies offer digital-asset-specific IRAs like BitIRA, where individuals can add altcoins such as LTC to their retirement portfolios.\nThe move to allow more Americans to invest crypto into retirement accounts may be gaining momentum. On April 1, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville announced the reintroduction of a bill to allow Americans to add cryptocurrency to their 401(k)s . The process would involve scaling back regulations issued by the Department of Labor.\nMagazine: X Hall of Flame: Bitcoin will ‘start ripping’ as Trump’s polls improve — Felix Hartmann\n...\nContinue reading Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investing\nThe post Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investing appeared first on CoinTelegraph .",

    "text": "OTTAWA — A Conservative MP apologized in the House of Commons on Thursday after an Indigenous colleague from across the political aisle called him out for linking an offender's criminal record to his race.\nBrad Redekopp says he misspoke earlier this week when he brought up the 2022 mass stabbings in Saskatchewan during a debate about measures to address systemic racism within the RCMP.\nOn Tuesday, the Saskatoon MP criticized parole officers for releasing Myles Sanderson on parole before the James Smith Cree Nation member perpetrated the killings.\nHe incorrectly suggested that the parole board predicted Sanderson \"was likely to reoffend because of his racial background.\"\nThe Conservative party sought to correct the record — not by striking the claim altogether but by changing it to say \"regardless\" of his racial background, instead of \"because\" of his racial background.\nIn a statement to The Canadian Press, Redekopp said he misspoke, and \"proactively asked that the record be corrected\" to reflect his intent and \"to avoid any misunderstanding or offence.\"\nWinnipeg MP Leah Gazan said she noticed the change in the House of Commons official record-keeping the next day, and said she expected an apology to follow.\nOn Thursday, Gazan stood in the House of Commons and demanded that he take accountability.\nHe stood in response and delivered an apology.\n\"Once again, I apologize for misspeaking. I never meant to offend anyone. I never meant to cast any aspersions on anyone because of race,\" he said in the House.\nBut Gazan said in the House that she doesn't accept Redekopp's explanation, or the way he apologized.\nShe asked the Speaker to make a ruling that the House of Commons should revert the record back to the original language, arguing that the Conservatives are trying to \"whitewash\" what happened.\n\"I would ask that the member reflect upon this, and I would ask that the official record actually reflect what occurred — what we all heard, and what the member has admitted to having said — rather than being rewritten to avoid accountability and responsibility,\" Gazan said.\nThe matter is under consideration.\n\"What he said in there was hurtful, it was harmful, it was offensive and it was racist,\" Gazan said in an interview earlier on Thursday.\nRedekopp insisted in his written statement that his comment had nothing to do with race, \"only the facts of the case at hand.\"\nAn investigation into the earlier release of Sanderson, who was accused of killing 11 people and injuring 17 others, found the Parole Board of Canada could not have foreseen the worst mass murder in Saskatchewan's history.\nThe National Joint Board of Investigation also found there were \"no pre-incident indicators or precipitating events that were known to staff, or that staff could have acted upon to prevent this incident.\"\nFor Gazan, it's another example of what she calls a pattern of anti-Indigenous rhetoric by Conservative politicians.\nShe listed off several examples.\nEarlier this year, Saskatchewan MP Kevin Waugh apologized after he accused First Nations of burning down water treatment plants because they're frustrated with the Liberals.\nIn 2018, an NDP motion that called on the Pope to apologize for residential schools got overwhelming support in the House of Commons — except from 10 Conservative MPs.\nAnd in 2008, before he was leader of the Conservative party, Pierre Poilievre apologized after saying Indigenous people need to learn the value of hard work more than they need compensation for abuse suffered in residential schools.\nLast year, Poilievre also came under fire for speaking to a Winnipeg-based group that ran radio ads in 2018 that said it was a myth that residential schools robbed Indigenous children of their childhood.\n\"There's a pattern of anti-Indigenous racism that occurs in the House,\" Gazan said, \"and certain members of political parties want to protect the rights and freedoms for some, but not others.\"\nA spokesperson for Poilievre didn't respond to a request for comment.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 6, 2024.\nMickey Djuric, The Canadian Press",
