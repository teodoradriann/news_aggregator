    "text": "An American citizen has been charged in Arizona with making threatening online comments that followed what police describe as a \"religiously motivated terrorist attack\" in Australia a year ago in which six people died.\nQueensland police officers Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold and innocent bystander Alan Dare were fatally shot by Gareth Train, his brother Nathaniel Train and Nathanial's wife, Stacey Train, in an ambush at the Trains' remote property in the rural community of Wieambilla on December 12, 2022.\nFour officers had arrived at the property to investigate reports of a missing person. They walked into a hail of gunfire, police said at the time. Two officers managed to escape and raise the alarm.\nPolice killed the three Trains, who have been described as conspiracy theorists, during a six-hour siege.\nThe FBI said agents arrested 58-year-old Donald Day Jr near Heber Overgaard, Arizona, last Friday.\nAuthorities said a federal grand jury indicted Day on two counts of interstate threats. The indictment said that from about the beginning of 2022 until February 2, 2023, Day \"engaged in a course of conduct demonstrating a desire to incite violence and threaten a variety of groups and individuals including law enforcement and government authorities\".\nDay, who lives in the northeastern Arizona town of Heber, was remanded to custody after he appeared in a Phoenix court on Tuesday and faces a potential five-year prison sentence if convicted, according to Arizona prosecutors.\nThe FBI is still investigating Day's alleged motive.\n\"The attack involved advanced planning and preparation against law enforcement,\" Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Cheryl Scanlon said, referring to the Trains.\n\"We know that the offenders executed a religiously motivated terrorist attack in Queensland. They were motivated by a Christian extremist ideology.\"\nAustralian police allege Gareth Train began following the suspect on YouTube in May 2020. A year later, they were communicating directly.\n\"The man repeatedly sent messages containing Christian end-of-days ideology to Gareth and then later to Stacey,\" Scanlon said.\nFBI legal attache for Australia Nitiana Mann said the FBI was committed to assisting the Queensland Police Service in its investigation.\n\"The FBI has a long memory and an even longer reach. From Queensland, Australia, to the remote corners of Arizona,\" Mann said.\n\"The FBI and QPS worked jointly and endlessly to bring this man to justice, and he will face the crimes he is alleged to have perpetrated.\"\n ",

    "title": "Coalition to target waiting time for asylum seekers’ appeals – The Irish Times",
    "text": "Asylum seekers who appeal a decision on their application to stay in Ireland could have their cases heard more quickly under proposals being considered by the Government. Ministers are planning to address the length of time that an appeal takes after this year cutting the length of time for first-instance decisions from an average of 22 months to three months. Fresh figures show there are currently 17,531 applications pending at the International Protection Office with 3,343 appeals before the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. The Coalition has already introduced an accelerated procedure for international protection applicants from designated safe countries of origin. The Department of Justice said these applicants now typically receive a first-instance decision in less than three months, down from a norm of 22 to 26 months early last year. Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman said capacity would need to increase at the appeals tribunal to bring down the length of time for a decision, as the process at present can in some instances take years. “As well as providing additional accommodation, we need that processing time to come down. Minister [for Justice] Helen McEntee has done a lot of work on the first stage with the international protection office; the processing time has come down very significantly. Now we have to work on the appeals tribunal, the second stage and subsequent stages, to make sure they can speed up as well so that people can get a decision, whether it is positive or a negative. “That initial stage has been reduced significantly, particularly since the safe-country approach was adopted where people from safe countries get a rapid processing of their application. But I think it is a question of increasing capacity at the appeals tribunal,” Mr O’Gorman said. The State is obliged to examine the application of anyone who presents at its borders and says they want to make an application for international protection. The number of international protection applications in 2022 was 13,650, a 186 per cent increase on the number received in 2019. The Department of Justice said that of the 17,531 applications for international protection that are pending, fewer than 2 per cent have been pending for more than two years. However, Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said there was a “crisis in the direct-provision system” after he received figures from the Department of Justice showing that one person waited 77 months for an initial decision on their application. “This was an ‘initial decision’ and not an appeal. The Government seriously needs to speed up the decision-making process to determine who qualifies as a refugee and who does not. It is extremely unfair to those who are genuinely fleeing persecution that they could be left waiting seven years in limbo or, worse, still that some end up homeless in makeshift camps on Dublin streets,” Mr Tóibín said. In response to questions from Mr Tóibín, Ms McEntee said reforms to the international protection process “will continue in 2024″ with about €34 million allocated in Budget 2024 to the International Protection Office and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal to continue to scale up processing. In total, 25,876 people are being accommodated by the State in International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) accommodation, of whom 5,590 are children. They are housed in IPAS centres, emergency centres, the National Reception Centre and tented accommodation. According to the latest figures, there are about 300 international protection applicants in Ireland without State accommodation, with those people now homeless. Earlier this month, the Government increased the weekly payments for asylum seekers who are not offered accommodation by €75, bringing the total weekly payment to €113.80. All arriving applicants who have not received an offer of accommodation are provided with an initial voucher of €100 to provide support in advance of receipt of the increased daily expense allowance. - Sign up for [push alerts](https://www.irishtimes.com/media/2023/11/07/stay-informed-with-push-alerts-from-the-irish-times-delivered-straight-to-your-phone/)and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone - Find [The Irish Times on WhatsApp](https://www.irishtimes.com/media/2023/10/27/find-the-irish-times-on-whatsapp-and-stay-up-to-date/)and stay up to date - Our In The News podcast is now published daily – Find the latest episode [here](https://www.irishtimes.com/podcasts/in-the-news/)",

    "text": "Uno de los paisajes más emblemáticos del mundo está en crisis: se trata del Monte Fuji, símbolo de Japón. Esta montaña luce sin las nieves acostumbradas para esta época. La Agencia Meteorológica japonesa aseguró que desde hacía 130 años no se veía así al Fuji durante los últimos días del mes de octubre. Según expertos, la causa es el cambio climático.\nEn general, la cumbre del volcán empieza a blanquearse alrededor del 2 de octubre. El año pasado, los primeros copos cayeron el 5 de octubre. Yutaka Katsuta, meteorólogo en los servicios de Kofu, en el centro de Japón, dijo que este año, a causa de las altas temperaturas, no se observó ninguna nevada.\nDesde que empezaron los registros en 1894, siempre se había reportado alguna nevada antes del 26 de octubre. Sólo en 1955 y en 2016 la nieve se hizo esperar hasta esa fecha límite. \"Las temperaturas fueron altas este año, lo cual supone un obstáculo a cualquier aire frío\", subrayó Katsuta, según los medios que difundieron la noticia.\nEl especialista señaló que el retraso probablemente obedezca al cambio climático. Los últimos dos verano boreales fueron los más cálidos en el Japón desde que empezaron los registros.\nLa historia del Monte Fuji\nEl Monte Fuji está situado a unas dos horas en tren desde el centro de Tokio y se puede ver a decenas de kilómetros, incluso desde la capital. Esta montaña es un símbolo nacional que quedó inmortalizado en numerosas obras de arte, como \"La gran ola de Kanagawa\" de Katsushika Hokusai.\nEl Monte suele estar cubierto de nieve durante la mayor parte del año, excepto de julio a septiembre. Es en ese período cuando muchos senderistas aprovechan para subir a su cumbre durante la noche y ver el amanecer a 3.776 metros de altura.\nNo obstante, la afluencia en la montaña más famosa del Japón fue menor este año porque las autoridades decidieron instaurar un permiso de entrada y una cuota diaria para evitar el exceso de turismo.\nEl verano pasado, el Ministerio de Medio Ambiente reportó unos 178.000 alpinistas, menos que los 205.000 del año anterior y de los años anteriores a la pandemia. La cifra supone una bajada del 14% entre julio y principios de septiembre.\nLa última erupción del Fuji data de hace tres siglos. Si bien hoy su interior ya no emite fuego y lava, este volcán enfrenta el desafío del calor extremo que está transformando los paisajes de todos los continentes y ecosistemas.\n***\nSuscribite al newsletter de LA GACETA “Completa con picante” y recibí semanalmente una selección de noticias para jóvenes con hambre de futuro. ¡Es gratuito!",

    "text": "Jude Menezes, an optimist at the worst of times and poker-faced at the best, allowed a rare display of emotion the minute the hooter went at the end of the match, kneeling down to say a silent prayer of thanks to the powers above.\nAs a lacklustre, erratic Indian women’s Olympic hopes ended with a 0-1 loss to Japan in the 3rd place play-off at the Olympic Qualifiers here on Friday, the India-born coach of Japan, a teammate of Hockey India president Dilip Tirkey during his playing days, knew how much January 19 win meant for his side.\nJapan had lost the last five games between the two sides but it won the one that mattered the most. With three spots on offer from the tournament, India had to finish on the podium to ensure it would travel to Paris later this year. But after giving everything on field in the semifinal against Germany, it was a very different India that turned up against Japan. Two months back in the final of the Asian Champions Trophy, India had won with ease. But when the stakes were raised, India faltered.\nIndian players during the FIH Women’s Olympic Qualifiers 2024 hockey match against Japan, in Ranchi on January 19, 2024. | Photo Credit: PTI\nThere was little India did right on the field on the day. Even as coach Janneke Schopman swung between stone-cold stoicism and disappointment on the sidelines, the Indian team swung between trying to attack and desperately defend. If the first half was all about Japan taking control of the game and dominating the Indian defence, the second was about India trying to shift gears and press hard. Japan earned its third penalty corner in the 6th minute and Kana Urata made no mistake in putting it ahead.\nIn reply, India had seven PCs in the second half but none of them had either the power to blast through the Japanese defence or the variation and guile to outsmart them. Menezes admitted after the game that the plan for his girls was to get the first goal and then sit back, absorbing the pressure, and they did it with precision.\nIndia appeared flustered and willing to give up early on, making the most basic of errors in trapping and passing and not even attempting the half chances. Even when they took charge post break, it was more an attempt to throw everything at the opposition defence inside the circle, hoping something would stick, rather than any planned attacks. The left flank was left unutilised and individual skills were non-existent.\nJanneke admitted the loss hurt. “I think we didn’t start well defensively, sometimes that can happen. What I saw was a team that fought back and dominated in the latter part, they were fighting and trying but couldn’t get the goal. It’s going to hurt for a long time because when the Olympics are on tv, we will want to be there and, to be honest, we have the quality to be there. That is on me, we should have been and that hurts,” she shrugged.\nLater in the day, it was an inconsequential final that Germany won 2-0 against USA – both teams having already booked their Olympic tickets -- to reassert its position as the best team in the competition.\nThe results 7-8: Chile 1 (Fernanda Villagran) bt Czech Republic 0; 5-6: New Zealand 3 (Olivia Merry, Hannah Cotter, Rose Tynan) bt Italy 1 (Ivanna Pessina); 3-4: Japan 1 (Kana Urata) bt India 0; Final: Germany 2 (Jette Fleschutz, Sonja Zimmermann) bt USA 0.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "text": "El cartel que conmemora el 25 aniversario de la coronación de la Virgen de la Estrella y que se ha presentado este viernes por la tarde incluye un sentido homenaje al periodista de ABC de Sevilla Fernando Carrasco , fallecido en 2016. De este modo, la pintura que ha realizado el artista Jonathan Sánchez Aguilera incluye recortes de los periódicos originales de hace 25 años, entre ellos los artículos que realizó Carrasco.La hermandad ha presentado esta obra cinco meses antes de la celebración de la salida extraordinaria que realizará La Estrella, entre los próximos días 31 de octubre y 2 de noviembre. La pintura de Sánchez Aguilera, hermano de la corporación, centra la composición en el rostro de la dolorosa, que aparece rodeado de los recortes de los periódicos originales de hace 25 años . De este modo, en el lienzo se incluyen numerosas crónicas de 1999 con relatos de la ceremonia de la coronación, los actos previos o la procesión de vuelta de la Estrella. Entre ellos destacan los artículos de Fernando Carrasco, que en 1999 fue el cronista de ABC de Sevilla para contar todo lo relativo a la coronación de la Estrella.Los recortes han sido pegados alrededor del rostro y tratados con óleo, acrílico y pastel . «Todos los fragmentos -ha dicho el autor en la presentación- componen un mosaico de la gente y de las cosas maravillosas que pudimos vivir. Ahí está el momento en el que el entonces arzobispo Amigo Vallejo coronó a la Virgen. Una foto que también se difundió de manera especial, y eso que en 1999 no existían las redes sociales ni los actuales elementos de difusión».Hiperrealismo y collageEl artista ha combinado su estilo hiperrealista del rostro de la Estrella con el collage de la mayor parte del cartel. En la parte inferior y con un tratamiento de pintura más suelo aparece una visión de Triana desde la orilla de Sevilla. «Sosteniendo la historia de los recortes de prensa y la belleza de la Estrella –ha añadido Sánchez Aguilera- aparecen el puente y el río cuando el sol se empieza a despedir el Domingo de Ramos . A la hora en la que ya ha pasado la Virgen y el cielo le dice adiós pintando la verbena de colores con la que empieza a marcharse la atardecida».Como colofón del acto de presentación, el poeta y escritor Antonio García Barbeito , también hermano de la Estrella, ha leído un romance de Nicolás Fontanillas en el que se menciona la cruz que forman cada Domingo de Ramos el puente y el río, escena que aparece en el cartel.",
