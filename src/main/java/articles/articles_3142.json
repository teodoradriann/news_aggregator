    "title": "Nigeria: Muslims grab land of 10,000 Christians in Chibok since 2021",
    "text": "This is what it’s all about: expanding the House of Islam at the expense of the House of War. This is why it’s the same story the world over: Muslims encroaching on non-Muslim areas and claiming them as their own. The goal is obvious, yet universally ignored and denied.\n“Boko Haram Grabs Land of 10,000 Christians in Chibok Since 2021,” by Mike Odeh James and Luka Binniyat, Truth Nigeria , May 21, 2024 (thanks to the Geller Report ):\n(Maiduguri) An unreported calamity has fallen on the embattled Chibok community, site of the government school for girls that Boko Haram terrorists attacked 10 years ago, shocking the world. It wasn’t long before First Lady Michelle Obama herself led the cry “Bring back our girls!”\nThe good news from the Nigerian army is that since the beginning of this year, 386 captives of Boko Haram (only some of whom were Chibok girls) have been rescued from the desert-like Sambisa Forest. In recent months, a trickle of the remaining Chibok girls have been rescued from Boko Haram as the terrorist refuges in the Lake Chad area collapse under army pressure.\nBut that good news is belied by the fact that some of the parents and relatives of the kidnapped Chibok girls are being driven off their ancestral lands by Boko Haram. The land grabs, which started in 2021, have happened under the blind eyes of state- and federal authorities, according to residents interviewed by TruthNigeria.\nKibaku Christians Targeted for Replacement by Muslims\nThe 30,000 people living in Chibok, chiefly of the Kibaku ethnic group, are predominantly Christian and have faced forced displacement, land confiscation, and threats of death or forced conversion to Islam.\nMore than 10,000 Kibaku Christians have been driven off their lands by Boko Haram and ISWAP (Islamic State in West Africa Province), according to Mr. Yakubu Nkeki, the President of the Association of Parents of Kidnapped Chibok Girls.\n“This eviction of Christians from their ancestral lands started around March 2021 when Boko Haram started confiscating Christian lands and giving it out to Muslims,” Nkeki said.\n“The affected villages were once home to thriving Christian communities, but now they are largely deserted. The terrorists have confiscated the farmlands and reallocated them to Muslims, leaving the displaced Christians without a source of livelihood,” Nkeki told TruthNigeria correspondents in an exclusive chat on May 12, 2024.\nResidents speak of mass expulsion and intimidation\nResidents of Chibok town explained that natives of their outlying villages have suffered mass expulsion by Boko Haram terrorists and ISWAP. A Chibok farmer told TruthNigeria he was evicted from his Takulashi farm on December 15, 2023.\nISWAP members came to the communities of Takulashi and Mbulakodiga, asking “who were Christians?” according to Adamu Taro, 44. After getting their answer, they ordered locals to leave or face instant death. “Four hundred people then left and went to live with relatives. Immediately, their lands were given to Muslims,” Taro said in an exclusive chat to TruthNigeria.\n“Many Kibaku Christians who refused to leave were killed or kidnapped on their way to their farms,” Taro went on to say. “If a Christian goes to a farm, a Boko Haram will appear with guns and threaten the Christians to either leave or be killed,” Taro said.\nAnother resident of Chibok, Magareth David Yamma (a pseudonym. Yamma said publishing her true name could be fatal), one of the mothers of the abducted Chibok girls, said to TruthNigeria, “Boko Haram terrorists are surrounding us and our communities; they are gradually pushing Christians from the surrounding villages while resettling the villages with Muslims; as a result, there is hunger.”…",

La interrupción de este servicio representa un atentado contra el acceso a la justicia laboral y deja en situación de desamparo a quienes más lo necesitan”, manifiestan.\nTambién hablan de la Comisión Médica de Rafaela y las “suspensiones y condiciones indignas”, que existen: “Asimismo, expresamos nuestra preocupación ante la suspensión de turnos y audiencias en la Comisión Médica de Rafaela, ubicada en el Parque Industrial, un lugar alejado, de difícil acceso y sin cobertura de transporte público”.\n“A esto se suma que las instalaciones actuales son precarias y carecen de condiciones mínimas de atención y espera, obligando a trabajadores lesionados o con enfermedades laborales a permanecer a la intemperie durante horas”, indican.\n“La paralización de audiencias y turnos no sólo vulnera la dignidad de los trabajadores, sino que genera demoras inadmisibles en el circuito de atención médica y pericial, afectando directamente sus derechos”, sostienen.\n“Desde la CGT Rafaela exigimos a las autoridades correspondientes que adopten con urgencia las medidas necesarias para restablecer el normal funcionamiento de estos servicios y garantizar condiciones dignas y equitativas para las y los trabajadores”, dicen y concluyen: “La desprotección, la demora y la precarización institucional no pueden ser la respuesta del Estado ante quienes construyen día a día el motor productivo de nuestra región”.",

    "text": "At 23:56, Ukraine apprehensively anticipates its most challenging winter yet. Ukraine Braces for Severe, Dark Winter as Russian Attacks Target Power Grid Fighting off damage to its power and energy infrastructure brought on by Russian assaults, Ukraine is readying for a harsh and dim winter. \"We're dealing with the most demanding winter in our history,\" spoke Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko during a video conference. This winter is anticipated to be even more challenging than the previous one, given the culmination of damages from ongoing Russian attacks. The Russian military is utilizing various weapons in coordinated attacks to cause maximum damage, stated Haluschenko. Electricity consumption in a mild winter is around 18 gigawatts, while in a cold one it's 19 gigawatts. Moreover, a reserve of 1 gigawatt must be established, said Haluschenko. Russian attacks have destroyed approximately 9 gigawatts of capacity. 23:08 NATO Increases Security at Geilenkirchen Airbase In response to a potential risk, NATO has upgraded its security level at the airbase in Geilenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia. All non-essential staff have been sent home, a spokesperson for the base reported. This decision was based on intelligence information about a potential threat. \"This isn't a reason to be alarmed and is a precautionary measure to ensure we can carry on with our critical operations,\" explained the spokesperson. The police confirmed their presence on the scene. More details, including the number of deployed forces, are not being disclosed. 22:07 Ukraine Declares Strike on Russian Base in Kursk Region The Ukrainian military has reported another attack on Russian forces in the Kursk region. Using precision-guided US bombs, they targeted a Russian base in the afternoon, as per the commander of the air forces, Mykola Oleshchuk. \"A drone command post, a radio-electronic warfare unit, equipment, weapons, and up to 40 Russian military personnel were hit,\" Oleshchuk wrote alongside a video displaying the attack. 21:43 Ukraine Announces First Meeting After Swiss Peace Summit Following the peace summit in Switzerland in June, the first follow-up meeting has taken place, according to Ukraine. Participants from more than 40 states and organizations attended the virtual session. Subsequent meetings of working groups are planned. 21:08 Habeck Urges More Employment for Ukrainian Refugees in Germany German Economy Minister Robert Habeck hopes that more Ukrainian refugees will find employment in Germany. While certain obstacles, such as family-related situations, illness, war traumas, or necessary childcare, could hinder employment, the Green politician advised Welt TV, \"However, in general, it's preferable for everyone to work – better for the people, their integration, and for the social system.\" Habeck sounded skeptical towards statements made by Brandenburg's Minister-President and SPD politician Dietmar Woidke, who questioned the allowance of Ukrainian refugees. \"Probably due to the somewhat rough eastern German election campaigns and insufficient contemplation.\" 20:28 Ukrainian Troops Launch Counteroffensive in Charkiv Region The Ukrainian military has declared a push in the Charkiv region. Troops have advanced almost two kilometers into enemy territory, according to the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian ground forces. The goal of this operation was to weaken the offensive capabilities of the 20th Army of the Russian Federation, which the Ukrainian military asserts has been accomplished. This cannot be independently confirmed. The brigade also reports that the Russian side has lost 300 soldiers in the last four days, and a considerable amount of equipment and weapons have been destroyed or damaged. The extent of the reported counterattack remains unclear. 20:00 Ukrainian Intelligence Allegedly Hacks Russian TV Programming The Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) is said to have interfered with the broadcast of several Russian TV channels and replaced them with a video about the war in Ukraine. \"HUR has 'hacked' Russian television and showed the reality of the war [to the population],\" a source from the intelligence service informed the \"Kyiv Post\" newspaper and the RBC Ukraine news agency. The video was broadcast three times during prime time yesterday evening. Among the affected channels were Pervouralsk, Evraziya 360, and Pervyj Kanal TV. Following the attack, nine channels temporarily suspended their programming, it was reported. 19:16 Lithuania Reports Drop in Russian Ground Troops in Kaliningrad In the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, located between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, there has reportedly been a decrease in the number of ground troops stationed there, according to the commander of the Lithuanian armed forces, Raimundas Vaikšnoras, in an interview with the news portal \"Delfi\". He attributes this to the Ukrainian offensive in the Russian region of Kursk. When the war against Ukraine began, it was observed that a large amount of equipment and personnel were redeployed from Kaliningrad, the commander stated. Soldiers have since returned after rotation, but a decrease is currently being observed, especially among ground troops. 18:40 \"What's the point of Armenians?\" - Lukashenko sparks unrestBelarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko's remarks about Armenia have sparked unrest. Demonstrators pelted the Belarusian embassy in the Armenian capital Yerevan with eggs on Wednesday and demanded the ambassador's removal, as reported by Ukrainian media. Earlier, Lukashenko criticized Armenia's pro-Western stance on Russian state television: \"What use are Armenians? None. Let them improve their economy and rely on their own resources. Who is France? Who's Macron? Tomorrow, when Macron is gone, nobody will remember the Armenians,\" he said, alluding to the French president. Relations between Armenia and Russia, its long-term ally, have grown increasingly tense since Azerbaijan's swift military operation in September took the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, ending the 30-year rule of Armenian separatists. 18:03 Ukraine Reports Casualties from Rocket AttackTwo people have been killed in the Sumy region near the Russian border with Kursk after a Russian attack using two rockets, as reported by the Ukrainian prosecutor's office. The targets were components of the infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had visited Sumy earlier in the day and stated that attacks on the city had lessened since parts of Kursk had been captured. 17:28 Russian Authorities: Tanker on Fire After Ukrainian AttackA tanker is ablaze in the Russian port of Kavkaz in the Krasnodar region east of Crimea, local authorities report. This follows an alleged Ukrainian attack. Several Russian media outlets have published images and videos showing the blaze and black smoke columns. The Ukrainian military also shares such videos on social media, with the caption \"Neptune attacks the port of Kavkaz\" on their Telegram channel. Unverified reports from Russian Telegram channels suggest the ship was hit by a Neptune anti-ship missile, although the official range of this weapon is 300 kilometers, and the front line is further away. Moscow relies heavily on this port to supply its troops in its conflict against Ukraine. Update at 18:39: According to the crisis center of the Krasnodar region, the ship has sunk after the fire. There were reportedly 30 fuel tanks on board.

Earlier, Ukrainian President Zelensky had stated plans to reinforce troops in the area. Now, he reports a success in the Russian region of Kursk, with troops capturing another village and taking more Russian soldiers prisoner. According to these reports, Ukrainian troops control 94 villages and over a thousand square kilometers of land in Kursk. However, this has not been independently confirmed. 16:12 Ukraine Denies Nuclear Power Plant Attack, Warns of Russian DeceptionUkraine denies Russian President Vladimir Putin's claim that Ukrainian troops attempted to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant last night. \"This is a blatant lie,\" writes Andrii Kovalenko, head of the department for combating disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. He suggests that Russia may be planning a nuclear provocation itself, stating that the \"risk of a nuclear provocation by Russia is real\" given Putin's involvement. 15:46 EU Gas Storage Near Target Capacity Gas storage facilities in the European Union are nearly at their target capacity of 90%, as reported by the EU Commission. Two months before the target date, the EU is declared \"prepared for the next winter\". In the summer of 2022, the 27 member states agreed that EU gas storage should be at an average of 90% capacity by November 1st. According to data from the Gas Infrastructure Europe portal, there are differences between countries: Spain leads with 100%, while Latvia has the lowest at around 69%. Germany's storage is at 93.6%. The EU aims to further reduce dependence on Russian natural gas, importing more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US and gas from Norway instead. 15:21 Putin Accuses Ukraine of Attacking Russian Nuclear Plant Russian President Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of attempting to attack the nuclear power plant in Kursk. \"The enemy tried to attack the nuclear facility last night,\" says the Kremlin chief, offering no evidence. \"The International Atomic Energy Agency has been informed,\" Putin adds during a televised cabinet meeting. The IAEA had previously warned of the potential impact of fighting on the power plant and urged \"all parties to exercise maximum restraint.\" 14:50 IAEA Head to Visit Russian Nuclear Plant The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, intends to visit the Russian nuclear power plant in Kursk next week. An IAEA spokesperson confirms this visit can take place \"next week.\" In early August, the Ukrainian army launched a surprise offensive in the Russian region of Kursk.

These robots have the capability to deactivate mines in hard-to-reach locations while maintaining a safe distance from the operators. Timothy Snyder said, \"One of the most heinous acts Russia has committed in Ukraine is the scattering of millions of mines. I've visited territories near the front line where people take risks to help others return to their farms and homes. With these robots, mines can be cleared, and lives can be saved.\" The removal of mines in Ukraine could take decades. 08:01 Kremlin Preparing Russians for \"New Reality\" The Ukrainian attack on Kursk poses a problem for Moscow's propaganda. Even though the regions are far away, according to an unnamed Kremlin-linked source, the intrusion of Ukrainian forces into Russian territory is a \"new and very unpleasant event.\" To pacify the now noticeably anxious mood, the Kremlin is working to prepare the Russians for a \"new reality\" and a \"new normal.\" The message is: The enemy has indeed invaded Russian territory, they are close to defeat - but the retrieval of the territory will take time, and the Russians must be patient. In the meantime, residents are encouraged to \"convert negativity and shock into a positive direction\" - namely by contributing aid for the Kursk region. According to Meduza's interview with various officials, the conflict in the Kursk region could last several months. A government-linked source estimates that this is \"quite optimistic - if everything goes well.\" 07:30 Russian governor Confirms Fire in Military Facility Russian authorities confirm a fire at a military facility in the southern Russian region of Volgograd after a Ukrainian drone strike.

According to the Guardian, Putin had a near-hypnotic influence on Trump, who McMaster had warned that \"he is the best liar in the world.\" Overnight, explosions were reported in Kalach-on-Don, a city in Russia's Volgograd region. According to various Russian Telegram channels, these explosions were allegedly the result of a drone attack. It's said that a fire broke out at a nearby airbase. Kalach-on-Don is approximately 900 kilometers southeast of Moscow. The likely target was the Marinovka airbase in the Oktyabrsky village, around 20 kilometers from Kalach-on-Don.

He claims that those who deviate from the consensus on important foreign policy issues are \"randomly put under pressure and threatened with isolation\" by Western democracies, according to a statement released on the anniversary of the 1968 Moscow invasion. In the statement, Fico compares the violent suppression of the \"Prague Spring\" in 1968 by Warsaw Pact troops to what he sees as existing pressure in today's Europe.

    "text": "Escribe: [Paola del Carpio](https://gestion.pe/autor/paola-delcarpio/), coordinadora de Investigación de REDES. Un reciente informe de la [FAO ](https://gestion.pe/noticias/fao/)indica que, entre el 2021 y el 2023, el 52% de los peruanos sufre de [inseguridad alimentaria](https://gestion.pe/noticias/inseguridad-alimentaria/) moderada o severa. Esto, en tiempos de podios, nos coloca en uno que no queremos: medalla de oro en [inseguridad alimentaria](https://gestion.pe/noticias/inseguridad-alimentaria/) a nivel de Sudamérica. Ante ello, uno esperaría un absoluto sentido de urgencia en las autoridades. Muy por el contrario, el ministro de una cartera crítica para la lucha contra el [hambre ](https://gestion.pe/noticias/hambre/)dice que en el Perú no se pasa [hambre](https://gestion.pe/noticias/hambre/), que es una ofensa al orgullo nacional afirmarlo siendo una capital gastronómica y que, como él no cena, se encontraría en inseguridad alimentaria grave. [LEA TAMBIÉN: Pagos por resultados: ¿Qué es y cómo podría mejorar la gestión pública?] El ministro indica que no hay un problema de acceso a cantidad de alimentos, sino de calidad. Además, que el total de peruanos que padecen hambre es considerablemente menor, haciendo alusión a la proporción de peruanos en condición de pobreza extrema. Aquí se mezclan conceptos y es importante desmenuzarlos, así como entender cómo llegamos a este punto de una crisis que sí existe, indistintamente de la fuente que se consulte. Cuando una persona padece de inseguridad alimentaria, no logra acceder a alimentos nutritivos en la cantidad y calidad adecuada, sea por falta de recursos para costearlos o déficit en la producción. Según la FAO, esta es leve cuando se tiene incertidumbre sobre la capacidad de obtener alimentos en un futuro inmediato; es moderada cuando se reduce la cantidad o calidad de los alimentos y hay incertidumbre sobre el acceso inmediato a los mismos por falta de recursos; y esta es severa si la persona se ha quedado sin alimentos o incluso pasado días sin comer. En este último grupo están quienes padecen de hambre y ese indicador ha pasado de 4.1 millones de peruanos en 2014-2016 a 6.9 millones en 2021-2023. No hay duda de que los peruanos en condición de pobreza extrema (2 millones) se encuentran en el grupo de personas que padecen hambre, pues no pueden costear una canasta de alimentos aún si usaran la totalidad de los recursos a alimentarse, cuando bien sabemos que nadie usa el 100% de sus recursos a un solo rubro. Sin embargo, las personas en condición de pobreza no extrema (8 millones) e incluso de vulnerabilidad (10.6 millones) también han visto afectada su capacidad de consumo de alimentos, tanto en cantidad como calidad. Según el IEP, el total de hogares que se quedaron sin alimentos por falta de recursos era de 57% en septiembre del 2023, lo cual es el triple de lo que teníamos en el 2012 cuando había niveles de pobreza similares a los actuales. [LEA TAMBIÉN: Bolsas emergentes, crecimiento y diversidad] La inflación alimentaria desde el 2021, las anomalías climáticas que han afectado la disponibilidad de algunos alimentos, y la pérdida de poder adquisitivo como resultado de una economía ralentizada y empleo precarizado han pasado una factura carísima. El 66% de los entrevistados por el IEP en marzo del 2023 indicó que redujo su consumo de alimentos por el aumento de precios. El 30% indicó que el día anterior a la encuesta no había consumido en ninguna de sus comidas carne, pollo, cerdo o pescado, y el 40% de los consumidores habituales de leche dejó de hacerlo en 5 o más oportunidades. Además, al primer trimestre del año, el INEI identifica que cuatro de cada 10 peruanos presenta déficit calórico, el nivel más alto de los últimos 20 años. Finalmente, la FAO indica que el total de adultos peruanos con obesidad ha aumentado en 2.8 millones en los últimos 10 años. Por donde se mire, estamos en problemas, señor ministro. En el Perú tenemos, entonces, problemas de acceso a los alimentos tanto en términos de cantidad (porque el dinero no alcanza para comprar tanto) como de calidad. El problema de la inseguridad alimentaria tiene varias aristas y, lo que es peor, tiene efectos de al menos mediano plazo que, si no se atienden oportunamente pueden comprometer aún más nuestro potencial de desarrollo. Resulta inadmisible que se busque minimizar o quitarle importancia al problema del hambre que ha crecido tanto en los últimos años. Ningún número de peruanos atravesando esta situación diferente de cero debe parecernos aceptable. Sin reconocimiento del problema, seguiremos ajenos a las soluciones, que pasan tanto por dinamizar la economía e inversión para generar empleos, como por atender directamente de una forma más eficiente a quienes hoy pasan hambre. Coincidentemente, se viene llevando a cabo en Trujillo un foro de ministros de agricultura de APEC para tratar el tema de inseguridad alimentaria de manera conjunta. ¿Cómo afinar estrategias para atender mejor a las zonas urbanas? ¿Qué medidas se pueden tomar para evitar el desperdicio de alimentos? ¿Cómo se mitigará el inevitable avance del cambio climático que ya ha venido afectando nuestros cultivos y precios de alimentos? Ojalá obtengamos respuestas reales en lugar de más afirmaciones poco felices.
