    "title": "Data Cleaning in SQL: How To Prepare Messy Data for Analysis – KDnuggets",
    "text": "Image generated with Segmind SSD-1B model\nExcited to start analyzing data using SQL? Well, you may have to wait just a bit. But why?\nData in database tables can often be messy. Your data may contain missing values, duplicate records, outliers, inconsistent data entries, and more. So cleaning the data before you can analyze it using SQL is super important.\nWhen you’re learning SQL, you can spin up database tables, alter them, update and delete records as you like. But in practice, this is almost never the case. You may not have permission to alter tables, update and delete records. But you’ll have read access to the database and will be able to run a bunch of SELECT queries.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll spin up a database table, populate it with records, and see how we can clean the data with SQL. Let’s start coding!\nFor this tutorial, let’s create an\nemployees table like so:\n-- Create the employees table CREATE TABLE employees ( employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY, employee_name VARCHAR(50), salary DECIMAL(10, 2), hire_date VARCHAR(20), department VARCHAR(50) );\nNext, let’s insert some fictional sample records into the table:\n-- Insert 20 sample records INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, salary, hire_date, department) VALUES (1, 'Amy West', 60000.00, '2021-01-15', 'HR'), (2, 'Ivy Lee', 75000.50, '2020-05-22', 'Sales'), (3, 'joe smith', 80000.75, '2019-08-10', 'Marketing'), (4, 'John White', 90000.00, '2020-11-05', 'Finance'), (5, 'Jane Hill', 55000.25, '2022-02-28', 'IT'), (6, 'Dave West', 72000.00, '2020-03-12', 'Marketing'), (7, 'Fanny Lee', 85000.50, '2018-06-25', 'Sales'), (8, 'Amy Smith', 95000.25, '2019-11-30', 'Finance'), (9, 'Ivy Hill', 62000.75, '2021-07-18', 'IT'), (10, 'Joe White', 78000.00, '2022-04-05', 'Marketing'), (11, 'John Lee', 68000.50, '2018-12-10', 'HR'), (12, 'Jane West', 89000.25, '2017-09-15', 'Sales'), (13, 'Dave Smith', 60000.75, '2022-01-08', NULL), (14, 'Fanny White', 72000.00, '2019-04-22', 'IT'), (15, 'Amy Hill', 84000.50, '2020-08-17', 'Marketing'), (16, 'Ivy West', 92000.25, '2021-02-03', 'Finance'), (17, 'Joe Lee', 58000.75, '2018-05-28', 'IT'), (18, 'John Smith', 77000.00, '2019-10-10', 'HR'), (19, 'Jane Hill', 81000.50, '2022-03-15', 'Sales'), (20, 'Dave White', 70000.25, '2017-12-20', 'Marketing');\nIf you can tell, I’ve used a small set of first and last names to sample from and construct the name field for the records. You can be more creative with the records, though.\nNote: All the queries in this tutorial are for\nMySQL. But you’re free to use the RDBMS of your choice.\nMissing values in data records are always a problem. So you have to handle them accordingly.\nA naive approach is to drop all the records that contain missing values for one or more fields. However, you should not do this unless you’re sure there is no other better way of handling missing values.\nIn the\nemployees table, we see that there is a NULL value in the ‘department’ column (see row of employee_id 13) indicating that the field is missing:\nSELECT * FROM employees;\nYou can use the\nCOALESCE() function to use the ‘Unknown’ string for the NULL value:\nSELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, hire_date, COALESCE(department, 'Unknown') AS department FROM employees;\nRunning the above query should give you the following result:\nDuplicate records in a database table can distort the results of analysis. We’ve chosen the employee_id as the primary key in our database table. So we’ll not have any repeating employee records in the\nemployee_data table.\nYou can still the SELECT DISTINCT statement:\nSELECT DISTINCT * FROM employees;\nAs expected, the result set contains all the 20 records:\nIf you notice, the ‘hire_date’ column is currently VARCHAR and not a date type. To make it easier when working with dates, it’s helpful to use the\nSTR_TO_DATE() function like so:\nSELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, STR_TO_DATE(hire_date, '%Y-%m-%d') AS hire_date, department FROM employees;\nHere, we’ve only selected the ‘hire_date’ column amongst others and haven’t performed any operations on the date values. So the query output should be the same as that of the previous query.\nBut if you want to perform operations such as adding an offset date to the values, this function can be helpful.\nOutliers in one or more numeric fields can skew analysis. So we should check for and remove outliers so as to filter out the data that is not relevant.\nBut deciding which values constitute outliers requires domain knowledge and data using knowledge of both the domain and historical data.\nIn our example, let’s say we know that the ‘salary’ column has an upper limit of 100000. So any entry in the ‘salary’ column can be at most 100000. And entries greater than this value are outliers.\nWe can check for such records by running the following query:\nSELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 100000;\nAs seen, all entries in the ‘salary’ column are valid. So the result set is empty:\nInconsistent data entries and formatting are quite common especially in date and string columns.\nIn the\nemployees table, we see that the record corresponding to employee ‘bob johnson’ is not in the title case.\nBut for consistency let’s select all the names formatted in the title case. You have to use the\nCONCAT() function in conjunction with UPPER() and SUBSTRING() like so:\nSELECT employee_id, CONCAT( UPPER(SUBSTRING(employee_name, 1, 1)), -- Capitalize the first letter of the first name LOWER(SUBSTRING(employee_name, 2, LOCATE(' ', employee_name) - 2)), -- Make the rest of the first name lowercase ' ', UPPER(SUBSTRING(employee_name, LOCATE(' ', employee_name) + 1, 1)), -- Capitalize the first letter of the last name LOWER(SUBSTRING(employee_name, LOCATE(' ', employee_name) + 2)) -- Make the rest of the last name lowercase ) AS employee_name_title_case, salary, hire_date, department FROM employees;\nWhen talking about outliers, we mentioned how we’d like the upper limit on the ‘salary’ column to be 100000 and considered any salary entry above 100000 to be an outlier.\nBut it’s also true that you don’t want any negative values in the ‘salary’ column. So you can run the following query to validate that all employee records contain values between 0 and 100000:\nSELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, hire_date, department FROM employees WHERE salary 0 OR salary > 100000;\nAs seen, the result set is empty:\nDeriving new columns is not essentially a data cleaning step. However, in practice, you may need to use existing columns to derive new columns that are more helpful in analysis.\nFor example, the\nemployees table contains a ‘hire_date’ column. A more helpful field is, perhaps, a ‘years_of_service’ column that indicates how long an employee has been with the company.\nThe following query finds the difference between the current year and the year value in ‘hire_date’ to compute the ‘years_of_service’:\nSELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, hire_date, department, YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(hire_date) AS years_of_service FROM employees;\nYou should see the following output:\nAs with other queries we’ve run, this does not modify the original table. To add new columns to the original table, you need to have permissions to ALTER the database table.\nI hope you understand how relevant data cleaning tasks can improve data quality and facilitate more relevant analysis. You’ve learned how to check for missing values, duplicate records, inconsistent formatting, outliers, and more.\nTry spinning up your own relational database table and run some queries to perform common data cleaning tasks.

Ha sido una de las manchas solares más grandes y activas, unas 15 veces más ancha que nuestro planeta, la que ha enviado esta potente llamarada solar. Esta mancha solar creció hasta los 200.000 km de diámetro y es tan grande que se puede observar desde la Tierra sin necesidad de ampliar la superficie del Sol, eso si con protección y filtros adecuados. De hecho, rivaliza con la que dio lugar a la gran tormenta solar conocida como el evento Carrington en 1859. La actividad solar durante estos días ha sido particularmente alta, acercándonos [al pico del ciclo solar, que se prevé para finales de este año 2024.](https://www.eltiempo.es/noticias/el-sol-alcanza-su-maximo-en-2024-seran-las-tormentas-solares-mas-fuertes) Las regiones activas AR3663 y AR3664 han sido las protagonistas de esta actividad, iluminando el Sol con múltiples llamaradas y eyecciones de masa coronal (CME). AR3664, situada en el cuadrante sur del sol, ha lanzado llamaradas de clase X, las más poderosas y energéticas según la clasificación que aumenta de A a X en escala de potencia. La NOAA ha clasificado la inminente tormenta geomagnética como G4, la segunda más intensa en su escala, que puede provocar apagones de radio y perturbaciones en la red eléctrica. Se espera que el viento solar alcance la Tierra este fin de semana, con potenciales tormentas de nivel G3 hoy viernes y una esperada tormenta de nivel G4 mañana sábado. ¿Qué riesgos e impacto podría tener esta tormenta solar? Las consecuencias de una tormenta G4 incluyen problemas en el control del voltaje y posibles desconexiones de sistemas de protección para evitar errores mayores en la red eléctrica. Además, se espera que afecte la navegación por satélite y pueda causar problemas de orientación en las naves espaciales. Durante un ciclo solar de 11 años, solo se producen en promedio 100 tormentas de clase G4, haciendo de este evento una situación no muy frecuente pero de considerable impacto. Además de las perturbaciones tecnológicas, las tormentas geomagnéticas de esta magnitud son capaces de provocar [auroras boreales en latitudes más bajas de lo habitual](https://www.eltiempo.es/noticias/explosion-de-auroras-boreales-en-estos-dias-llegaran-a-espana). La NOAA también advierte sobre los posibles efectos a largo plazo, incluyendo daños a las líneas eléctricas y posibles interrupciones en las comunicaciones. Dada la intensidad de las tormentas previstas, se recomienda a las autoridades y a las empresas de servicios públicos estar en alerta máxima y tomar medidas preventivas para minimizar el impacto de estas perturbaciones solares.",

    "title": "Epidemic of diseases spreading in Gaza could harm injured IDF soldiers, experts say",
    "text": "The rate of disease infections spreading among the population in the Gaza Strip is rising, with local doctors reporting a lack of means to monitor the situation before it deteriorates. The World Health Organization's emergency director in the Middle East, Rick Brennan, warns that epidemics could break out in Gaza \"very rapidly\" in the absence of early detection measures. Read more: Israel has been very careful about delivering humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, part of which is routinely seized by Hamas terrorists. Moreover, international health organizations warning about the situation in Gaza have not succeeded in delivering medicines or even checking on the Israeli hostages held by Hamas for almost three months. In recent days, Israel has expressed concerns that IDF soldiers might be exposed to dangerous infections, fungi and molds growing in the Gaza soil contaminated from sewage leaks. This week, it was reported that a soldier died of a fungus he contracted in Gaza. The soldier lost both legs due to the injury, and the wound likely was exposed to the contaminated ground at that time. He was initially treated at Assuta Ashdod Hospital and later transferred to Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center to receive specialized treatment for the severe infection that spread throughout his body. \"This is something that happens in combat zones, not just in Gaza,\" Dr. Bibiana Hazan, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Emek Medical Center, explained to Ynet. \"Medical literature reports that it also happened in the wars of American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. War injuries are very complex, and when it comes to a non-sterile environment like a battlefield, it can be dangerous.\" \"Bacteria and fungi are part of our environment, and when they 'settle' on an area that is very damaged due to lack of tissue, pressure, and poor blood supply, then the place can easily become infected. The bacteria and fungi in Gaza are no different from the bacteria and fungi we have here. What makes these infections so complex and dangerous is the condition of the wound from the start,\" she added. Currently in Gaza, the number of cases of diarrhea in children less than 5 years old jumped at a monthly rate of 20 times to more than 100,000. There were also cases of respiratory infection as well as many cases of chicken pox, scabies, lice and various skin infections. Dr. Tahrir al-Sheikh, a pediatrician, worked at the Al Nasser hospital, and was forced to move to southern Gaza when the war broke out. There she provides medical services in a school that has become a place of refuge for displaced Gazans. \"We used to take cultures, and adjust the treatment according to the results. Now it is impossible to do this, and infectious diseases are spreading,\" she said. She said that she treated a four-month-old baby who had severe diarrhea and also said there is a lack of coronavirus tests. \"I had cases of patients who did not respond to treatment, but I could not tell if they had corona, because there is no the diagnostic equipment,\" she said. UNRWA's director of communications, Juliet Touma, visited the facility in Khan Younis that can accommodate about 1,000 people and has turned into a shelter for about 30,000. \"400 people share one toilet. There is not enough water for showers and cleaning and there are not enough hygiene products,\" she said.",

    "text": "The US is standing up against China's unfair economic practice, standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and revitalising its partnership with allies like India, US President Joe Biden has said. In his last State of the Union address before the November election, Biden said the US wants competition with China, but not conflict. Biden on Thursday told Americans that the country is in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st Century against Beijing. \"We are standing up against China's unfair economic practice, standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait but revitalising our partnership with allies and the Pacific, India. Australia, Japan, South and Korea,\" he said. “For years, all I've heard from my Republican friends and so many others is that China's on the rise and America is falling behind. They've got it backwards. America is rising,\" he said. The US has the best economy in the world, Biden said in his third State of the Union Address to the Congress which was watched by millions of Americans Thursday night. “Since I've come to office, our GDP is up. And our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade,” he said \"I've made sure that the most advanced American technologies can't be used in China's weapons. Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do that,” Biden said. “And we're in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st Century against China or anyone else for that matter,” said the president in his speech.",

    "text": "Facebook, Instagram, Threads : cette décision de Meta rend les plateformes dangereuses\n[Insolite](/categorie/insolite)\nMeta, dirigé par Mark Zuckerberg, est composé de différents réseaux sociaux tels que Facebook, Threads et Instagram. Dans une annonce du 7 janvier dernier, le groupe a dévoilé les nouveautés en terme de réglementations et ces nouvelles règles vont impacter les membres de la communauté LGBT ainsi que les femmes et plus généralement les minorités. Explications.\nFacebook, Instagram, Threads, ... des plateformes de plus en plus dangereuses\nEn effet, si vous êtes une femme ou que vous faites partie de la communauté LGBTQ+ ou de toute autre minorité, les plateformes sociales détenues par le groupe Meta risquent de devenir des endroits très dangereux pour vous. Pour quelle raison ? Tout simplement parce que le groupe dirigé par Mark Zuckerberg a décidé de procéder à des changements en ce qui concernant sa politique de modération sur les réseaux sociaux comme Facebook, Instagram et Threads.\nLe patron de Meta a communiqué sur ces nouveautés à travers une vidéo en commençant par annoncer que le système de fact-checking prendrait fin aux États-Unis et s'inspirerait de X avec un système de notes de communauté. Les internautes pourront ainsi apporter des précisions et de la clarté sur les publications des autres utilisateurs. Cette décision a provoqué l'inquiétude de la diplomatie française qui a rappelé que \"la liberté d'expression, droit fondamental protégé en France et en Europe, ne saurait être confondue avec un droit à la viralité qui autoriserait la diffusion de contenus inauthentiques touchant des millions d'utilisateurs sans filtre ni modération\".\nMeta fait moins de répression sous couvert de la liberté d'expression\nPour atteindre son objectif de \"revenir aux racines de la liberté d'expression sur Facebook et Instagram\", Zuckerberg a modifié la modération. Désormais, les propos haineux à l'encontre des minorités, ne seront plus interdits. Cela signifie qu'il sera possible de qualifier les personnes homosexuelles, transgenre ou non-binaires de \"malades mentaux\" ou de les désigner avec le terme \"ça\". De plus, un internaute pourra déclarer librement, et sans voir sa publication supprimer, que des personnes transgenres \"ne devraient pas exister\".\nMeta supprime également les règles qui interdisaient les insultes sur l'apparence, la race, le handicap, la religion, le sexe, les ethnies ... Autant dire que les personnes issues des minorités risquent de se retrouver en danger en parcourant les plateformes sociales du groupe de Zuckerberg.\nCes annonces de Mark Zuckerberg ont provoqué la réaction d'associations américaines de défense des droits LGBT+ qui considèrent ces changements comme l\"opportunité de \"cibler les personnes LGBTQ, les femmes, les immigrants et d'autres groupes marginalisés avec de la violence, du vitriol et des récits déshumanisants\" allant même jusqu'à affirmer que \"Meta continue de normaliser la haine anti-LGBTQ à des fins lucratives\".\nNotons que pour l'instant, la France n'est pas concernée par ces changements opérés par Meta.",

    "text": "It's officially spring, but Friday's snow across southern Ontario could bring one of the largest one-day snowfall totals of the year Spring has sprung, but winter certainly isn't going out without a fight across southern Ontario. A low-pressure system south of the border is grazing the region to end the week, producing a bout of snow that’ll continue into the overnight hours on Friday. In fact, this could be one of the biggest one-day snowfalls of the year for some areas, with 10-15 cm forecast into Saturday. Slow traffic and slippery roads were reported across southern Ontario by early Friday evening as the snow intensifies around the evening commute for many areas, including Toronto and Hamilton . Stay aware of your local road conditions before heading out, and be wary of rapidly deteriorating roads. Widespread special weather statements, snowfall warnings, and winter travel advisories are in effect, warning of the heavy snow, fast snowfall rates, and its impact on travel and commute times. SEE ALSO: April 8 solar eclipse is the must-see celestial event this spring Friday into Saturday AM: Widespread snow picks up, warnings in effect A Colorado low sweeping into the Great Lakes is responsible for this spell of winter weather across southern Ontario. Periods of snow will continue spreading over southern Ontario through Friday evening. Folks in eastern Ontario will see the snow arrive by Friday night. A slight jog to the north in the storm’s track will push warmer air closer to the border, which could allow for some mixed precipitation or rain on the shores of Lake Erie. Easterly winds blowing off Lake Ontario could enhance snowfall rates a bit in the Golden Horseshoe, helping to slightly increase snowfall totals around Toronto and Hamilton. Snow will taper off for most of southern Ontario overnight Friday into the wee morning hours on Saturday. DON'T MISS: Mild winter to blame for early pollen release in southern Ontario Widespread snowfall totals of 5-10+ cm are expected from Windsor straight up Highway 401 toward Cornwall . Accumulations of about 10 cm are likely right around the Golden Horseshoe, which could bring Toronto its largest single snowfall of the season. Greater uncertainty exists around the National Capital Region as a storm track farther south would bring Ottawa minimal snows. Drivers beware: This snow could greatly hamper travel 5-10 cm of snow isn’t much in the grand scheme of weather hazards. But it’s plenty to make roads slippery, especially as the sun goes down. Add in traffic during Friday evening’s commute, as well as the fact that many drivers have removed their winter tires for the season, and this setup raises the risk for slowdowns and accidents throughout the region. By this time of year, we're usually used to the snow by the end of the cool season—but Canada’s warmest winter on record did a number on Toronto’s snowfall totals. We’ve only seen about 55 cm of snow since November, and it’s been pretty evenly spread out. Toronto’s largest one-day snowfall this season was a paltry 6.4 cm that fell on February 15, with the city’s greatest two-day snowfall was 7.6 cm that fell between January 11-12. The relative lack of impactful snow we’ve seen in the GTA this season will increase the risk for travel issues once the snow begins on Friday. Looking ahead, calmer conditions will prevail across southern Ontario this weekend as below-seasonal temperatures settle over the region. Forecasters are watching a potential warm-up next week as southerly winds blow ahead of our next low-pressure system expected to approach the Great Lakes.
