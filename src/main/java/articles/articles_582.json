    "title": "Orthodox Union to Present 180K Letters to White House, Advocating for Israel Amid Gaza Conflict",
    "text": "In a significant show of support for Israel , the Orthodox Union , one of America's largest Jewish advocacy groups, has announced plans to deliver 180,000 letters to the White House on April 3. This act aims to mark 180 days since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict, urging President Biden to maintain staunch support for Israel, combat antisemitism, and facilitate the release of hostages.\nAdvertisment The move comes as the Biden administration's stance towards Israel's military actions in Gaza draws scrutiny, with recent abstention from a UN Security Council vote calling for an immediate ceasefire highlighting a shift in U.S. policy. The Orthodox Union, alongside partners such as the Jewish Federations of North America and the Anti-Defamation League, seeks to reinforce the need for a strong U.S. backing of Israel in these tumultuous times.\nEscalating Concerns Amid Continued Conflict The Orthodox Union's decision to gather such a substantial number of letters stems from growing concerns over the U.S. government's tempered support for Israel's defensive measures in Gaza. This concern was exacerbated by the U.S. abstention from a critical United Nations Security Council vote, which demanded an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages. The abstention is viewed by many as a sign of the Biden administration's frustration with Israel's military tactics, despite the existential threat posed by Hamas.\nAdvertisment International Reactions and Diplomatic Tensions Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained defiant in the face of international pressure, vowing to continue operations in Gaza despite warnings from the Biden administration about the potential humanitarian implications. This stance has led to strained relations, with Vice President Kamala Harris expressing that a major military operation in Rafah could be a \"huge mistake,\" indicating the tightrope the U.S. is walking in balancing diplomatic relations and humanitarian concerns.\nCommunity Mobilization and Advocacy Efforts The Orthodox Union, along with its allied organizations, is mobilizing a broad network of support, drawing letters from synagogues nationwide to emphasize the Jewish community's unified stance. This initiative is not just about supporting Israel's right to defend itself; it's also a call to action against antisemitism and for the protection of human rights, including the safe return of hostages held by Hamas. The delivery of these letters to the White House is a symbolic yet powerful gesture intended to remind the U.S. administration of the critical role it plays in ensuring peace and security in the region.\nAs the Orthodox Union prepares to make its voices heard at the White House, the broader implications of this initiative remain to be seen. This gesture represents a plea for decisive leadership in a time of crisis, emphasizing the importance of unwavering support for allies and the need for a proactive stance against threats to peace and security. The outcome of this advocacy effort could significantly influence U.S. policy and international relations, underscoring the power of community mobilization in shaping the discourse on global conflicts.",

    "text": "Melbourne, Dec 29 C aptain Pat Cummins took his second five-wicket haul of the Boxing Day Test, taking his match tally to ten scalps, and leading Australia to a series win with a 79-run victory over a much-improved Pakistan on day four’s play at the MCG here on Friday. aptain Pat Cummins took his second five-wicket haul of the Boxing Day Test, taking his match tally to ten scalps, and leading Australia to a series win with a 79-run victory over a much-improved Pakistan on day four’s play at the MCG here on Friday. After being handed a heavy 360-run defeat in the first Test in Perth, Pakistan put up a much better showing in Melbourne, with Agha Salman and Mohammad Rizwan threatening to pull off an improbable chase through their 57-run partnership. But Cummins returned to take out Rizwan on review for his 250th Test wicket, which showed the ball had touched his wristband while trying to evade the delivery. He then took out Aamer Jamal and Shaheen Shah Afridi to bag his ten-fer in Tests, becoming the second Australia captain after Allan Border to do so. Mitchell Starc claimed scalps of Salman and Mir Hamza on successive deliveries, as Australia secured a hard-fought win. Australia are now up in third place in the WTC points table, while Pakistan have slipped to fifth place. With the New Year Test at Sydney starting on January 3, Australia will be tempted to add more points with another win over Pakistan. In the morning, Australia began from an overnight score of 187/6, with a lead of 241 runs. Alex Carey scored a fighting 53 and added 75 runs for Australia with the tail’s help. Shaheen (4-76) and Hamza (4-32) were the standout performers for Pakistan as Australia made 262 in the second innings. After setting a daunting target of 317, Australia struck early as Abdullah Shafique fell to Starc for four, while Imam-ul-Haq was dismissed for 12 by Cummins. However, Shan Masood and Babar Azam joined forces to help Pakistan make progress. But the 61-run stand came to an end when Cummins struck and removed Masood. Babar held on for some time but eventually fell to a beauty from Josh Hazlewood. Rizwan and Salman then got together and helped Pakistan cross 200. However, Cummins struck thrice to leave Pakistan tottering at 237/8. Mitchell Starc eventually finished the game at that very score by picking back-to-back wickets. Cummins was the Player of the Match for just his second ten-for in Test cricket. He finished with 10/97 in the game. Brief scores: Australia 318 and 262 (Mitchell Marsh 96, Alex Carey 53, Mir Hamza 4-32, Shaheen Shah Afridi 4-76) beat Pakistan 264 and 237 (Shan Masood 60, Agha Salman 50, Pat Cummins 5-49, Mitchell Starc 4-55) by 79 runs Pat Cummins bags 10-wicket haul as Australia clinch series with 79-run win over Pakistan Found this article helpful?

    "text": "“Negro” Piñera hablará con JC sobre el diagnóstico de cáncer a la sangre y los 6 meses de vida que le dieron los médicos.\nImpacto ha generado la noticia de que Miguel “Negro Piñera fue diagnosticado con un cáncer a la sangre, y que habría sido desahuciado por los médicos, con un pronostico de 6 meses de sobrevida.\nTras conocerse el grave diagnostico, Julio César Rodríguez anunció que este domingo emitirán la que podría ser la última entrevista en vida del “Negro”, donde entrega detalles de su diagnóstico y cómo enfrentará este difícil momento.\n“Esta vez la doctora me dijo ‘Negro, te quedan 6 meses’” o “No le tengo miedo a la muerte, me voy a encontrar con mi hermano, si ya me mandó un Whatsapp ‘Negro trae la guitarra’” y Quiero morirme sin dar pena, no quiero dar lastima compadre. Siento que no es un mal momento para partir”, son alguna de las frases del músico que dejan ver el avance de la entrevista.\nEntrevista de JC\nEn su página de Instagram, JC reflexionó sobre lo complejo que fue realizar la entrevista, explicando que fue el mismo “Negro” quien les pidió hacer la entrevista el pasado martes, pues el miércoles iniciaría la quimioterapia.\n“El martes sonó mi teléfono. Al otro lado una voz gastada y más seria que de costumbre. Era Miguel. Me dijo: “Quiero darte querido mi última entrevista!” Pensé que se iba a vivir fuera de Chile y él me respondió que venía saliendo de su tercera visita médica y que todos le habían dicho lo mismo: Que le quedaban 6 meses de vida! Quedé paralizado al otro lado del teléfono”, indicó en Instagram.\n“Me pidió hacer la entrevista lo antes posible porque el miércoles se internaría para su primera ”quimioterapia programada. El ánimo no era el habitual, los medicamentos fuertes! “¿Cuándo me habías visto tomar tanta agua?”, me dijo riéndose. Poco a poco fue saliendo de la tristeza para que conversáramos de su enfermedad y de la vida en una extensa entrevista! “Quiero que la gente sepa que soy un tipo alegre por sobre todo”, me dice. Quiero cantar!! Canta Un Beso y Una flor! No quiero llorar me dice! Nos reímos!”, agregó JC.",

    "text": "Jeanne d'Arc qui pousserait la chansonnette, serait vêtue des plus exubérants costumes ou évoluerait dans un monde blindé d'anachronismes, bande originale rock en fond sonore ? On peut s'attendre à tout face à ce projet improbable : la Pucelle d'Orléans revisitée... Par le réalisateur de Moulin Rouge !, Roméo + Juliette et Elvis. Baz Luhrmann, car c'est l'homme qui nous intéresse, est passionné par Jeanne d'Arc. C'est pour cela qu'il va réaliser son rêve, transposer sur grand écran la Martyr. La promesse d'une épopée en guise de prochain film mais surtout, une oeuvre qui promet d'être étonnante. Car quand il met en scène Elvis Presley, Luhrmann accole au King des morceaux de rap apparus bien des décennies plus tard. Et quand il transpose Shakespeare (avec un tout jeune Dicaprio) il modernise la tragédie à grands coups de flingues, de gangstas, et de clips MTV. Idem, son Gatsby le Magnifique voit le héros créé par Francis Scott Fitzgerald vivre ses fêtes mythiques sur le rythme du rap de Kanye West ! Mais pourquoi cette production Warner Bros. qui promet d'être très ambitieuse est-elle susceptible de se démarquer à ce point ? Il suffit de lire son pitch... Improbable ou génial ? On s'interroge face à ce projet, toujours est-il que l'angle choisi est pertinent : ce Jeanne d'Arc prendra en partie place pendant la guerre de Cent Ans et se définit d'emblée comme \"l’histoire ultime du passage à l’âge adulte d’une adolescente\", ainsi que le relate [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/baz-luhrmann-joan-of-arc-1235048594/) via Warner. En gros, Luhrmann veut faire de Jeanne d'Arc un personnage de teen movie, ou film pour ados. Comme l'étaient déjà en vérité les Roméo et Juliette de l'un de ses plus grands succès, interprétés par les jeunes Léonardo Dicaprio et Claire Danes à l'époque. Il faut juste replacer ce récit somme toute banal de \"passage à l'âge adulte\" sur fond de Guerre, de conflits sanglants, et d'appel divin ! Ce film qui ne devrait pas débarquer avant l'an prochain est très symbolique. Car cette nouvelle vision d'une figure Sainte est également l'énième transposition d'une femme très sacralisée au cinéma. Ce faisant, la \"Joan of Arc\" de Luhrmann devait envahir nos salles obscures près d'un siècle après La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc, le chef d'oeuvre muet de Carl Theodor Dreyer, film matriciel du septième art. Film de Dreyer qu'adulait notamment Jean-Luc Godard, qui cligne de l'oeil dès son titre à la fameuse \"Passion du Christ\", et auquel un autre grand cinéaste, Chris Marker, dédiât ces mots : \"La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc est le plus beau film du monde\".",

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on?\nThat question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.\nThe results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized.\nThose who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered.\n“I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study.\nPeople are also reading…\n“It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.”\nAbout 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said.\nThe participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly.\nA follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change.\nThe study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls.\nThat evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars.\n“You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him.\nAdler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him.\nAfter a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy.\nRather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list.\nAfter six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%.\nThe cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75.\nAmong those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said.\n“It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.”\nIn other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered.\n“I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.”\n“It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.”\n20 facts about homelessness in the US\n20 facts about homelessness in the US\nThe U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020\nConversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010\nThe end of the federal eviction moratorium in August 2021 made millions of Americans' housing situations more precarious during the long tail of the COVID-19 pandemic\nAs of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month\nThe marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness\nHUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022\nA greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020\n40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered\nVeteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010\nFamily and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020\n50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022\nSince 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12%\n6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020\nIn 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8%\nThe number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",
