    "text": "Manchester residents raise concerns about needles as new cleanup program launches A new program in Manchester is aimed at cleaning up trash and used needles, as some residents said parts of the city are getting worse. The StreetPlus program is tackling issues in the city's business district. \"We're actually proud of what we're doing, and I think the community is taking this seriously, as well,\" said James McGee, operations manager of the StreetPlus team. The StreetPlus team has been active for a month, collecting more than 3,100 pounds of trash and 52 needles. >> Download the free WMUR app to get updates on the go: [Apple](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=109350X1567034&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fwmur-news-9-breaking-news%2Fid504646663%3Fign-mpt%3Duo%253D6&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmur.com%2Farticle%2Fmanchester-trash-needles-cleanup-program-81524%2F61891152&xcust=undefined) | [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hearst.android.wmur&hl=en) << \"And I think it's going to send a message to people here in Manchester and around the state that we are open for business,\" said Mayor Jay Ruais. Ruais said the program will expand, adding two more workers, known as ambassadors, and focus on graffiti removal and improving street lights. But some residents said they're concerned about other areas of the Queen City. Resident Drew Parsons said he has found needles at Manchester Place and Stark Park. \"Unfortunately, yesterday, I found at least 12 needles just strewn on the grass on Heritage Trail, and it causes so much concern,\" he said. Resident Christine Galle was walking her dog at Stark Park on Thursday. \"There's a lot of kids that come out here with their families, and they play in the grass, and that's a real risk for them,\" she said. \"It speaks to the larger challenge that we have to address homelessness,\" Ruais said. \"And this is one of the reasons why we've been so proactive in our approach in the first eight months to address things along rail trails or in our parks.\" The mayor encouraged residents to report issues through the See-Click-Fix app, saying that the app alerts the Public Works Department.",

    "title": "Donte DiVincenzo Has Capitalized On His Inclusion In the Starting Lineup",
    "text": "The Minnesota Timberwolves removed Mike Conley from their starting lineup ahead of their game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Jan. 7. Chris Finch said they made the change to maximize Conley’s game. The veteran guard has struggled to find consistency this season but remains a trusted figure on this team.\nThe change has brought mixed results for Conley, but that hasn’t been the case for Donte DiVincenzo.\nDiVincenzo, 27, is averaging 18 points, five assists, and five rebounds in the five games since they promoted him into the starting lineup. He’s been productive and is finally starting to look like the player Timberwolves fans hoped they were getting in the Karl-Anthony Towns trade.\nEarlier in the season, the former Villanova guard wasn’t shooting well enough to space the floor for Minnesota. His three-point shot wasn’t falling, and he didn’t seem as assertive as he was with the New York Knicks. However, DiVincenzo has started to hit his stride when the team needs it. Before the Wolves added him to the starting unit, he was becoming a dependable piece and stayed on the court late in close games.\nThe change hasn’t only benefited DiVincenzo. The Wolves have won three of their last five games, and two of the losses against the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors were winnable games, to say the least. The offense looks much better because it showcases more than Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle’s individual brilliance. The Wolves are also ninth in offensive rating in these five games, unlike where they’ve been for most of the season, hovering around league average.\nDiVincenzo has played well off the catch and the dribble. He’s understood how to play with Rudy Gobert all season, and that chemistry has manifested later in the season. DiVincenzo has used the effectiveness of Gobert’s screens to find openings for himself, and it’s made the Wolves much more potent offensively.\nEdwards recently expressed his frustration with the double teams he’s been facing. It’s a smart strategy, especially if it frustrates a player as talented as Ant. However, DiVincenzo’s shooting can make opponents second-guess their decision to send those double teams.\nThere was a sequence in Wednesday night’s games against the Golden State Warriors where DiVincenzo found himself wide open for three as Buddy Hield and Gary Payton Jr. miscommunicated on a defensive assignment where they both went to guard Edwards. DiVincenzo made the shot, and the Warriors immediately realized their strategy had to change.\nLate in the game, Golden State defended DiVincenzo intensely, leading to better offense for the Timberwolves. That’s how this team can improve offensively, and the numbers suggest they’re well on their way to doing that. After the game, Finch complimented DiVincenzo for his contributions after he finished with 28 points, nine assists, and six rebounds.\nAs Finch alluded to in his postgame comments, DiVincenzo has been just as important to the team’s defense. He’s brought a level of tenacity that shows in how he competes during every possession.\nI saw this live in the Los Angeles Clippers game on Jan. 5, immediately before the lineup change. Finch had DiVincenzo guarding James Harden late in the game, which is still challenging, even though he’s 35. DiVincenzo stayed disciplined as Harden showcased his dynamic handle, and the possession ended with a low-percentage shot.\nPlays like this exemplify what DiVincenzo’s brought to the Wolves lately. One must hope his production only continues to grow.",

    "text": "Tajani protesta contro il rapporto Ecri Articolo Precedente Articolo Successivo Antonio Tajani, intervenendo a \"4 di Sera\" su Rete4, ha affrontato i temi più rilevanti dell'attualità politica, partendo dal rapporto Ecri. \"Stamattina ho dato mandato al nostro rappresentante permanente presso il Consiglio d'Europa di elevare formale protesta contro quello che hanno scritto su di voi, perché è una vergogna,\" ha dichiarato il ministro degli Esteri, sottolineando come le forze dell'ordine italiane, spesso vittime di insulti e aggressioni, non meritino tali accuse. Tajani ha difeso con forza l'operato della polizia, evidenziando episodi in cui gli agenti hanno salvato vite umane, come nel caso di una donna decisa a suicidarsi, salvata in extremis da un poliziotto sospeso nel vuoto su un cavalcavia. Il rapporto della Commissione contro il razzismo e l'intolleranza del Consiglio d'Europa ha sollevato un allarme che il presidente Sergio Mattarella ha definito \"stupito\". Tuttavia, il presidente non ha contattato le vittime, spesso migranti, coinvolte nelle gravi inchieste per torture e violenze che vedono implicate le forze dell'ordine. Questo ha suscitato critiche, soprattutto da parte di chi ritiene che il presidente avrebbe dovuto esprimere vicinanza anche a loro. Il segretario generale del sindacato di polizia Silp Cgil, Pietro Colapietro, ha espresso ferma opposizione alle accuse mosse dall'Ecri, definendole infondate, offensive e decontestualizzate. Colapietro ha invitato il presidente dell'Ecri, Bertil Cottier, a conoscere da vicino il lavoro della polizia italiana e a chiedere scusa di persona per le affermazioni fatte. Ha inoltre sottolineato come gli agenti italiani siano spesso impegnati in operazioni di salvataggio, mettendo a rischio la propria vita per proteggere quella degli altri. Il dibattito sul rapporto Ecri ha acceso un acceso confronto tra le istituzioni italiane e la Commissione europea contro il razzismo e l'intolleranza, con le forze dell'ordine al centro di una polemica che mette in luce le difficoltà e i rischi del loro lavoro quotidiano.",

    "text": "Android 16 development is humming right along, which is doubly impressive when you consider that Google is well ahead of its normal release schedule this year. But with the beta program expected to hit its platform stability milestone next month ahead of a stable release in Q2 2025, things need to be moving at a brisk pace.\nRelated\nAndroid 16 timeline revealed: Platform Stability in Q1, rollout in Q2\nBeta releases begin in January\nGoogle announced Android 16 Beta 2.1 on Reddit today, calling attention to a few minor bugs that are being fixed, in addition to an issue with phones on Beta 2 randomly rebooting. The new version has a build number of BP22.250124.010 on supported devices, which include all of Google's phones, tablets, and foldables released since 2021's Pixel 6. Like Beta 2, this version includes the February security patches.\nThe release notes for this version are now available on Google's developer site, and we've pasted the full list below:\nAndroid 16 Beta 2.1 (February 2025)\nThis minor update to Android 16 Beta 2 includes the following fixes:\n-\nFixed an issue that sometimes prevented devices from entering Doze mode. (\nIssue #396603519) -\nFixed issues that caused some animations to appear choppy while configuring live wallpapers. (\nIssue #397659072) -\nFixed an issue that sometimes caused devices to reboot unexpectedly. (\nIssue #396541565) - Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, connectivity, and performance.\nAll eligible devices enrolled in the Android Beta for Pixel program will be offered an over-the-air (OTA) update to Beta 2.1.\nThe first bullet on that list mentions Doze Mode, a feature introduced with Android 6.0 Marshmallow that lets your phone go into a deeper sleep when certain conditions are met. Dave Burke, Google's VP of Engineering, explained last year that improvements in Android 15 have resulted in devices entering Doze Mode 50% faster than Android 14, resulting in up to three hours of additional standby time. It's unclear if the bugs addressed in today's update are the result of any additional changes being made to the system in Android 16.\nElsewhere, choppy system animations when setting a live wallpaper have been fixed, and a problem where phones would reboot into recovery mode shortly after powering on has been resolved. Google says today's release also includes various other performance and stability improvements.\nRelated\nAndroid 16 might let you easily ditch those Quick Settings tiles you never use\nMore Quick Settings changes may be coming\nAfter this release, we're expecting Beta 3 to usher in Android 16's platform stability era — a point at which all APIs and app-facing behaviors have been finalized. This is a particularly important milestone for developers looking to ensure their Android apps are fully compatible with the new version.\nAndroid 16 Beta 2.1 is being seeded as a standard OTA update, so as long as you're enrolled in the Android Beta Program on a compatible device, you can install it by heading to Settings → System → Software update → System update and tapping the Check for updates button. Google says the update is already going live, but it may take up to 24 hours to appear for all users.\nRelated\nApps can now see when Android 16's high-security mode is enabled and react accordingly\nThanks to new Advanced Protection APIs",

    "text": "- O mercado, hoje, está com uma predileção muito maior pelo Bitcoin do que por alguma outra altcoin\n- Ethereum continua sendo um ativo essencial no portfólio de qualquer investidor de criptomoedas\n- ETH sofre concorrência com as altcoins. A Solana subiu quase 60% desde o início de novembro\nNos últimos dois anos, o Ethereum ([ETH](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/tag/ethereum/)) tem ficado para trás em relação ao Bitcoin ([BTC](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/tag/bitcoin/)) em termos de valorização. No dia 24 de setembro de 2022, o Bitcoin valia US$ 18.921,97 e agora, em 22 de novembro de 2024, está cotado a US$ 98.324,51 – um impressionante aumento de 419,7%. Já o Ethereum, no mesmo período, subiu de US$ 1.318,36 para US$ 3.328,23, registrando um crescimento mais modesto de 152,4%.\nLeia também\nMesmo com essa disparidade no prazo mais longo, nesta sexta (22) o Ether chegou a bater o Bitcoin, 11,14%, contra 10,10%. Esse cenário pode levar investidores a se perguntarem: há alguma chance de o movimento do ETH superar o da principal cripto moeda do mercado cripto?\nO analista da Foxbit, Beto Fernandes, pondera que a comparação dentro do par ETH/BTC é desfavorável ao Ether. “Isso mostra que o mercado, hoje, está com uma predileção muito maior pelo Bitcoin do que por alguma outra altcoin”, avalia.\nPublicidade\nInvista em oportunidades que combinam com seus objetivos. [Faça seu cadastro na Ágora Investimentos](https://cadastro.agorainvest.com.br/dados-acesso?utm_source=estadao.com&utm_medium=patrocinio&utm_campaign=202003%3A%3Aa1%3Aagora%3Aeinvestidor_-_agora%3Aint%3Adisplay%3Aestadao.com%3Atodos%3A&utm_content=20210201%3Ae-investidor%3Acta%3A1x1%3Acta_comportamento%3Ana%3Ageral%3A)\nO especialista diz ainda que a demanda por ETH também não está nos seus momentos mais aquecidos, já que o interesse pelo BTC é maior do que qualquer outro token. “Será preciso uma reversão e o início de uma altseason para que esse padrão seja alterado”, comenta.\nNo jargão deste mercado, altseason é a temporada de altcoins, período em que as moedas alternativas ao Bitcoin passam a ter uma valorização intensa. Por enquanto, ainda não há perspectivas de mudanças. “Isso é visto no [comportamento dos próprios ETFs](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/criptomoedas/bitcoin-usd-btc-criptomoedas-recorde-fluxo-etfs/), por exemplo. Enquanto os fundos de BTC acumularam uma entrada de US$ 1,7 bilhão na última semana, os de Ethereum viram um fluxo positivo de ‘apenas’ US$ 515 milhões”, diz.\nDiversificação de criptoativos\nFalando ao [E-Investidor](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/ultimas/por-que-ethereum-eth-dispara-hoje/), Lukas Rocha, do ICP HUB Brasil, diz que o Ethereum continua sendo um ativo essencial no portfólio de qualquer investidor de criptomoedas. Ele destaca o papel central do ativo para as taxas de interação na Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) e sua relevância como uma das principais moedas do universo cripto. Rocha, no entanto, ressalta a volatilidade do mercado. “Sempre há correções pelo caminho. Então, a decisão de comprar ou vender é muito particular”.\nWagner, da Hurst Capital, acredita que o ETH ainda tem espaço para subir, mas dificilmente superará o desempenho do Bitcoin. “O Bitcoin é visto como uma reserva de valor, enquanto o Ethereum continua sendo a principal plataforma para [DeFi](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/tag/defi/) (finanças descentralizadas) e contratos inteligentes”, explica. Essa diferença de proposta entre as duas criptomoedas é um ponto-chave para entender suas trajetórias de valorização.\nOutro fator que faz com que o Ethereum tenha um desempenho menos otimista é a concorrência com as altcoins. A Solana ([SOL](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/tag/solana/)), por exemplo, ganhou muita tração no último ano e segue como promessa para 2025. “Desde o último dia 5, a SOL subiu quase 60%, e se mantém próxima de sua última máxima histórica”, diz Beto Fernandes da FoxBit.\nPublicidade\nEm favor do Ethereum, Valter Rabelo, head de ativos digitais da Empiricus Research, falando nesta [matéria](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/ultimas/por-que-ethereum-eth-dispara-hoje/) ao E-Investidor, observou que a capitalização de mercado do ETH em relação ao Bitcoin tem caído e parece próxima de um fundo. Para ele, isso sugere que o Ethereum ainda está desvalorizado, representando uma oportunidade para os investidores mais pacientes. “A criptomoeda ainda não subiu demais.” Esse detalhe, na sua visão, favoreceria sua inclusão no portfólio.",

    "title": "Sound Revolution: Operly Brings its Acclaimed Intelligence III Speakers to Israel",
    "text": "LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, December 28, 2023 /\nEINPresswire.com/ -- Operly, a company renowned for its advanced audio technology, has announced the introduction of its flagship line, the Operly Intelligence III horn loudspeakers, to the Israeli market, specifically in Tel Aviv. This marks a significant expansion for the brand, which is headquartered in London, as it brings its innovative audio solutions to a new audience.\nThe Operly Intelligence III is engineered for audiophiles who seek high-quality sound. This new generation of full-range speakers merges sophisticated engineering with state-of-the-art technologies. The outcome is an audio experience characterized by rich, clear sound that enhances the listening experience.\nThe Operly Intelligence III features a unique design and advanced technology. The speaker's monocoque body, made from high-grade fiberglass, boasts a uniform thickness of 15mm along the entire length of the backward horn. This design looks good and helps improve the speaker's sound quality.\nThe Operly Intelligence III incorporates both classic and innovative elements. The driver's unique design features a short coil with a small diameter and a high gap, ensuring uniformity in the magnetic field and fidelity in sound reproduction. A patented full-range horn system is another highlight, eliminating connections between the forward and backward horns. This design allows for a seamless integration of the front horn with the speaker diaphragm, enhancing the overall sound quality.\nPracticality is also a key aspect of the Intelligence III's design. Its three-point support ensures stability on uneven surfaces, and its dimensions are optimized for minimal space occupation while providing an optimal listening experience. The backward horn is angled to create a comfortable listening zone at a distance of 2.7 meters, and the design also addresses the issue of standing waves by angling the sides of the horn to avoid parallel surfaces.\nThe Operly Intelligence III's high sensitivity audio system creates an immersive listening experience, akin to being in a symphony hall. This allows for clear conversation even at high playback volumes, making it ideal for various settings.\nCustomers can personalize their Operly Intelligence III speakers with a wide range of finishes, including options from the German automotive color palette, allowing for a perfect match with any interior design.\nKonstantin Neymark, the founder of Operly, commented on the launch: \"You are used to a narrow throat horn, but we have implemented a wide throat one. And we have a different result. In our view, the wide throat horn provides the most detailed, coherent, musical, and live sound. This is the amazement of feeling live sound. Perhaps, this is the most important thing - Operly allows you to 'see with your ears...'\"\nIt is now available for purchase, with a suggested retail price of £33,000 / €37,000 / $40,000. Customers are invited to specify their color preferences upon ordering.\nFor more information, please visit\nwebsite\nAmir Brand\nOperly Ltd\n+972 9-880-4401\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nVisit us on social media:",
