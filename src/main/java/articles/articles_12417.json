    "text": "American Yared Nuguse celebrates after winning the men's 1500m in Zurich / © AFP\nAmerican Yared Nuguse offered up a perfectly-timed attack to claim victory in a top-quality re-run of the Olympic final to win the men's 1500m at the Zurich Diamond League on Thursday.\nNuguse, who claimed bronze in the Paris Games, outstripped Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen for the win in 3min 29.21sec.\nNuguse's US teammate and Olympic champion Cole Hocker finished third, while Dutch runner Niels Laros came in fourth, with world champion Josh Kerr of Britain in fifth.\n\"This race was so highly anticipated and I knew that it was going to be quick in the end,\" said Nuguse.\n\"Everyone could have got this race. I am glad I was still able to win.\n\"From the beginning, I just tried not to do any wrong move and to be where I wanted to be and then you need to be ready for the end.\"\nNuguse added that it had been a \"lot less stressful\" than the Olympics.\n\"It is so much more fun running with these guys today!\"\nIngebrigtsen beat Hocker in the Lausanne Diamond League, then went on to smash the 3,000m world record in Silesia, but picked up an infection which he said had hampered his preparations for Zurich.\n\"My race was better than I expected it yesterday. I still have not recovered,\" the Norwegian said.\n\"It was worth it to come here and race. But one more week of recovery would have been better for me and given me more stimulation.\"\nRarely has an event been as keenly contested in recent seasons as the men's 1500m, and so it once again proved in front of a packed Letzigrund Stadium.\nSlovenia's Zan Rudolf was the opening pacemaker, taking the pack through the opening lap in 55.61sec.\nThe pace saw the field strung out in single file almost from the off.\n- Fast finish -\nWinner Yared Nuguse (2nd L) and Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen (L) / © AFP\nBritain's Elliot Giles, fresh from a world record in the road mile race, took over the pace setting, Ingebrigtsen sat on his shoulder, followed by Nuguse, Kerr and Hocker.\nGiles stepped aside at the bell for the final lap, Ingebrigtsen in the lead.\nNuguse clung to his coattails, but a gap built on Kerr and the chasing pack.\nAs Nuguse took on the Norwegian down the home straight, Hocker made a late charge, but it was too late.\nNuguse edged Ingebrigtsen, Hocker coming in third, a different winner only serving to continue pushing the competition in the event.\n\"Tactically, it is always more difficult when you have a pacer, but it makes it interesting nevertheless,\" said Hocker.\n\"In races like this, with such a field, it makes you appreciate even more when you win or do well.\"\nGoing into the Paris Olympics, the narrative had all been about Ingebrigtsen avenging his world championships loss to Kerr.\nEven World Athletics president Sebastian Coe, himself a two-time Olympic 1500m champion and whose career involved an intense rivalry with Steve Ovett, dubbed the tug-of-war between the two tremendous for the sport.\n\"It has an added piquancy because this is probably not a friendship made in heaven,\" Coe said.\nKerr and Ingebrigtsen have traded barbs since the Scot swept past the Norwegian to snatch world gold in Budapest last year.\nBut both were upstaged at the Paris Games as the unheralded Hocker surged home for gold ahead of Kerr, Nuguse taking bronze ahead of Ingebrigtsen.",

    "title": "The Iconic Stethoscope Is Getting a 21st Century Makeover",
    "text": "Digital versions are coming on strong and this week the FDA cleared Eko Health’s algorithim-enhanced version that uses ECGs to screen for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Two years ago, a pair of New Zealand physicians wrote an opinion piece in a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Australasian of Physicians about point-of-care ultrasound. The gist of their argument was that ultrasound ought to be used more routinely to detect various heart and lung conditions. The somewhat cheeky title of that article is “Update on Echocardiography: Do We Still Need a Stethoscope?” Jason Bellet has spent more than a decade making pretty much the opposite case: Not only do healthcare professionals still need a stethoscope, they need a vastly improved, 21st century version that harnesses digital technology and artificial intelligence (AI) “It has been a decade’s journey to get clinicians more comfortable and familiar with digital stethoscopes and the advantages of taking something that is analog — a rubber tube — and pulling it into the digital age, the same way we’ve done with our doorbells and our thermostats and every other analog device,” says Bellet, the co-founder and a board director of Eko Health, an Emeryville, California, company that makes and markets digital stethoscopes. Bellet and Eko Health are celebrating an FDA decision this week that gave the go-ahead for an AI-generated enhancement to their main product, the CORE 500 digital stethoscope. Now companion software to the stethoscope can use the electrocardiograms (ECGs) that it takes to detect possible heart failure with low ejection fraction. The clearance was based on data from a 3,500-patient study that the company submitted to the FDA but has not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal or presented at a medical meeting. The proprietary algorithm was developed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Currently, heart failure with low ejection fraction — which accounts for approximately half of heart failure cases — is diagnosed primarily with echocardiograms. The algorithm that Eko is pairing with ECGs that its stethoscope takes will not replace echocardiograms for diagnosis but, in Bellet’s telling, will enable unprecedented screening for heart failure with low ejection fraction during a routine doctor's visit “When you are examining a patient during an annual wellness visit and you are listening for heart disease, now, for the first time, you can actually screen for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction,” he says. As a screening test for heart failure with low injection, the ECG algorithm is 74.7% sensitive and 77.5% specific, according to the data that Eko submitted to the FDA. That translates into a false negative (missed cases) rate of approximately 25% and a false positive (additional testing showing that the patient didn’t have heart failure with low ejection fraction) rate of 22.5%. Bellet says those numbers point to the AI-enhanced stethoscope’s status as a “clinical decision support tool.” The false negatives and positives should be considered against the backdrop of the current standard of care, he says, which includes no specific screening tests for heart failure, he says. It also positions the iconic stethoscope, draped around the neck of countless healthcare professionals around the world, as a more complex device for screening for cardiac and pulmonary disease. “That's the beauty of the stethoscope,” says Bellet. “It's used in under one minute in every physical exam.It’s really a screening and early detection device.” Bellet, 31, co-founded Eko with his University of California, Berkeley, college classmates [Connor Landgraf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connorlandgraf/), the company’s CEO, and Tyler Crouch. Landgraf, who has a masters in bioengineering from Berkely, saw the limitations of the traditional stethoscope and had the idea of digitizing its function. The company received FDA clearance for its first product, a digital attachment to a traditional stethoscope, in 2015. Two years later, the agency cleared the DUO, which, as the name suggests, combined traditional auscultation — listening to the sounds that heart and lungs make — with an ECG, which detects the electrical signals that drive the heart’s contractions. Stethoscopes vary widely in quality — and price. 3M’s Littmann stethoscopes are widely rated as having the highest quality. According to Bellet, Eko licensed its digital technology to Littmann about five years ago. Littman’s [CORE Digital Stethoscope](https://www.littmann.com/3M/en_US/littmann-stethoscopes/advantages/core-digital-stethoscope/) works with Eko software. Bellet characterized the arrangement as partnership rather Eko selling its technology to a rival. “They really wanted to offer a digital solution, and that's something that they turned to us to do,” he says.“It's been a really, really great partnership. And we had an opportunity to get our technology in the hands of more clinicians.” Meanwhile, some researchers at the Mayo Clinic who were on the early edge of machine learning and AI used access to the vast amounts of patient data collected and stored by Mayo to find a correlation between ECG measurements and heart failure detected by echocardiograms. As Bellet puts it, they discovered an ECG “signature” indicative of heart failure. Paul A. Friedman, M.D., chair of cardiovascular medicine at Mayo, and his colleagues reported results in January 2019 in [Nature Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30617318/) that showed their algorithm that uses ECG data could be used to identify suspected cases of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction without an echocardiogram. Friedman and his colleagues said their results showed that the algorithm’s accuracy was comparable to other screening tests, such as mammography for breast cancer and Pap smears for cervical cancer. In October 2023, the FDA [gave clearance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231002851453/en/Anumana-Receives-U.S.-FDA-510-k-Clearance-for-ECG-AI-Algorithm-to-Detect-Low-Ejection-Fraction) to a version of Mayo’s ECG AI for detecting low-ejection that uses the standard 12-lead ECG. That version of is marketed by Anumana, a healthcare AI company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is a joint venture of Mayo (Friedman chairs its board of advisors) and Nference. The FDA cleared Eko’s “low injection fraction tool” under rules that grant clearance to medical devices and software they are “substantially equivalent” to those that have been previously given an OK. In this case, the Eko’s tool was deemed substantially equivalent to Anumana low ejection fraction AI-ECG algorithm, although Eko’s relies on a one-lead ECG in the stethoscope and Anumana’s on the standard-issue 12-lead one. As a result of the FDA decision, Eko has added the low ejection fraction tool to its Sensora platform, which includes other AI-aided tools that identify atrial fibrillation and structural heart murmurs. It is an open question how much difference early detection of heart failure with low ejection fraction might make in preventing more serious illness or death. Friedman and his co-authors said in the Nature Medicine piece that asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is present in between 1.4% and 2.2% of the population and perhaps in much as 9% whose who older population. There are an increasing number of pharmaceutical treatments, including standbys such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers, and the SGLT2 inhibitors, such as Jardiance (empagliflozin) and Farxiga (dapagliflozin), which were originally diabetes medications but have since been approved for treatment of heart failure. Notwithstanding the intuitive appeal of screening, early detection and treatment, they don't always translate into the anticipated benefit. More research will be needed see how moving diagnosis and treatment plays out for asymptomatic heart failure patients. Bellet says Eko has sold more than 500,000 stethoscopes. On the company website, the CORE 500 is priced at $429. Almost all of the company’s sales have been in the U.S., and Bellet says the customers are split evenly between nurses and physicians. Not surprisingly, young, tech-welcoming healthcare professionals are digital stethoscope adopters, but Bellet says so are older ones who want to take advantage of the amplification and other features and “are really looking for support and being able to hear hard to hear heart sounds.” As described by Bellet, Eko’s sales strategy includes e-commerce channels, including its own website, and sales teams that pitch the stethoscopes and related software to health systems as an “early detection platform.” NCH (Naples Comprehensive Health), a small healthcare system in in Naples, Florida, put out a news release in February 2024 to announce it was using the Eko digital stethoscope and the related software to detect structural heart murmurs indicative of valvular heart disease during primary care visits (this was before the FDA clearance for low ejection fraction detection). The NCH news release says it was first healthcare system to do so. Ekoi’s press materials say it has raised $125 million, and it lists a number of venture capital firms and the Mayo Clinic as sources of the funds. Although more than a decade has gone by since Bellet and his college roommates founded Eko, he casts this as early days yet. “We’ve made a significant dent in the digital transformation of stethoscope technology in the U.S., but there is still a long way to go,” he says. And the digital stethoscope is the warm-up act. “The ultimate step is the smart stethoscope,” says Bellet. “We started by digitizing it and now we are building in the intelligence that really helps close the loop.” [DC Roundtable: Ceci Connolly and Margaret \"Meg\" Murray Talk Medicare Advantage, Drug Pricing and Political Priorities in 2024 Elections](/view/dc-roundtable-ceci-connolly-and-margaret-meg-murray-talk-medicare-advantage-drug-pricing-and-political-priorities-in-2024-elections?utm_source=www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com&utm_medium=relatedContent) In this second part of a two-part podcast episode, Managed Healthcare Executive's Managing Editor Peter Wehrwein spoke with Ceci Connolly and Margaret \"Meg\" Murray about Medicare Advantage utilization and challenges, highlighting proposed CMS payment cuts and prior authorization issues.

    "text": "Large waves and high surf pounded the Ventura County coastline Thursday, causing major flooding and damage. The swell was so powerful it pushed a tree and water right through protective glass and caused major damage to the hotel \"Inn on the Beach&apos; on Seaward Ave. Streets, cars and homes along the Ventura coast were flooded. Waves, as high as 20 feet, hit the Ventura pier. RELATED: Dangerous surf threatens Ventura County coast According to the Ventura County Fire Department, multiple rescues were made, including a lifeguard who got caught in the tide while attempting to rescue a surfer.\"Thank you God he crawled up and told him ‘you’re alive, you made it&apos;\", said Kim Lamberg. She and neighbors saw his yellow helmet bobbing in the water and called 911. They got him out just in time as another wave hit. \"The biggest wave of the day came in and caught all of us off guard because we weren&apos;t paying attention to the ocean anymore. We were around a human,\" she added. In total, eight people were injured. The high surf advisory led to a rogue wave pounding Seaward Street in Ventura, sending people like Ty Miller running.\"I was standing right there at the end of the wall and then there&apos;s just this wave. Everybody was watching the wave because it&apos;s a huge wave coming at you and right when it got closer, that&apos;s when everybody started to run and then all hell broke loose,\" said Miller.Miller said there were about 14 people around when the wave hit. \"I grabbed an elderly lady so she didn&apos;t slide all the way down and everybody ended up at the bottom and I lost one of my crutches and I hobbled over to my truck,\" Miller said.Ventura County Fire officials said eight people were injured.\"It was pretty bad, and then people were cut up and went to the paramedics. I work down here at Duke&apos;s so I&apos;m down here every day and I&apos;ve never seen waves pick up and swell that much,\" said Miller. People are advised to stay away from the water. A High Surf Warning and Coastal Flood Warning remain in effect through Saturday at 10 p.m. In Orange County, the coastal flood and high surf advisories will be in effect until 2 a.m. MondayAccording to forecasters from the National Weather Service, the next set of big swells will arrive Saturday.",

    "text": "'Just glad she was alive': Relative relieved Fayetteville teen survived ordeal while trapped in Kentucky man's home\nA North Carolina teenager was rescued from underneath a trap door inside a home in Kentucky on Christmas.\nAccording to arrest records, authorities responded to a domestic violence situation at a home on the 1400 block of Robertstown Road in Lincoln County, Kentucky.\nWhen authorities arrived, a man identified as Zackary Jones, said that a woman had been in the home but left.\nAuthorities spoke with Jones’ mother, who made the initial call; she said the woman never left the property. Jones' mother, Ronda Jones, spoke with WRAL News and said she called authorities after argument between Jones and the teen.\n\"They were arguing, yelling and screaming,\" Rhonda Jones said. \"It's probably the hardest thing I had to do.\"\nDeputies took Jones into custody after he tried to destroy drug paraphernalia inside.\nAfter searching the home, authorities found the woman – later determined to be a teen who had been missing from Fayetteville -- underneath a trap door inside Jones’ bedroom.\nWRAL News is not identifying the teen in order to protect her privacy.\nA close relative of the teen spoke with WRAL News about the matter on Friday.\n\"I was scared,\" the relative said. \"I tried to warn her...what could happen to her and the worst possible thing could have happened you know? I'm just glad she was found alive.\"\nThe teen has since returned to Fayetteville to get help.\n\"She told me that the guy tried to kill her and strangled her and she got away from him and went to the mom's house and told the mom what happened,\" the relative added. \"She was looking for a getaway for a little while and it turned out to be a lot different. He moved. He lured her and then kept her against her will.\"\nRhonda Jones said she didn't know about the trap door or the drug paraphernalia because she \"never went up there.\"\nAfter he was read his rights, Jones admitted having lured the teen to leave her grandmother’s home in North Carolina.\nHe first told her he was 19.\nWhen the two met, Zackary Jones told the teen he was 25 after she asked why he looked older than his photos and took her to his residence in Kentucky.\nAuthorities said the teen learned Jones was actually 34 years old after speaking with his family. Jones' mother said the teen had been there for a few weeks.\nThe teen said Jones told her to say she was 18 years old, adding he was armed with a .22 caliber handgun and threatened to shoot and kill her multiple times.\n\"I asked him how old she was. He said, 'she's 19.' So, I took that as the truth,\" Jones' mother said. \"I believed him, because a lot of girls looked older than they are.\"\nRhonda Jones said she had no reason to think the teen was underage.\n\"To me, she willingly came with him,\" Ronda Jones said. \"I just feel like, they'd probably been talking. I don't know how long he's been texting her. From what the cops said that she was unhappy where she was at, and she felt like she was cared for and came with him.\"\nThe teen also told authorities that the pair was stopped for a traffic violation on the night Jones picked her up, and that he threatened to shoot the deputy if he were to ask either Jones or the teen to step out of the car.\nAuthorities said Zackary Jones admitted to having a sexual relationship with the victim on at least 10 different occasions after getting her high on marijuana and crack cocaine.\n\"I was shocked,\" Rhonda Jones said. \"I'm always upset when he lies to me.\"\nAccording to the police report, Jones also said the victim begged him to kill her.\nAuthorities in Kentucky charged Jones with multiple felonies, including sex with a minor, domestic assault of a minor, and false imprisonment.\n\"No matter what he had done, he's my son and I love him. I'm sorry he did it, and that's all I can say,\" Rhonda Jones said.\nThe citation said the teen’s grandmother plans on filing charges in North Carolina.\nWRAL News reached out to the teen's family, who declined to be interviewed. The family said they are glad the teen is safe, but she's traumatized and needs time to heal.\n•Credits\n[Liz McLaughlin](/rs/bio/20385293/) [Chris Lovingood](/rs/bio/19840836/) [Gilbert Baez](/rs/bio/13292930/) [John Rector](/rs/bio//) [Michael Joyner](/rs/bio/4279543/) [Joseph Ochoa](/rs/bio/20648349/) [Ryan Bisesi](/rs/bio/20211237/)",

    "text": "Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. today released a new artificial intelligence model named Hunyuan Turbo S, designed as a “fast-thinking model,” a rival to so-called “slow-thinking” models such as DeepSeek-R1.\nThe company explained the model is capable of near “instant replies” within a second by doubling the output speed and cutting the delay of the first word out by almost 44%.\nDifferent from DeepSeek-R1 and other “reasoning models,” which the company said “think a little and answer,” the new Turbo S model is capable of beginning an answer immediately by using a short thinking chain that is more akin to human intuition. This is fused with a slow-thinking chain that provides reasoning capabilities for scientific, mathematical and rational answers.\nThe company said Hunyuan Turbo S demonstrated performance comparable to leading models on the market such as DeepSeek-V3, OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Anthropic PBC’s Claude in benchmarks for math, reasoning and knowledge.\nThe notable success of China-based DeepSeek’s AI models, such as R1 and V3 , has made numerous headlines in recent months, prompting numerous AI model developers to produce rival models rapidly . Competition has been hot from companies such as China’s Alibaba Group Ltd. with its Qwen 2.5-Max model , which it claims outperforms V3.\nTo create the model, Tencent used a Hybrid-Mamba-Transformer fusion to reduce the computational complexity and KV-Cache of the model’s Transformer architecture. The end result model is a hybrid that can use Mamba deep learning architecture , which excels at handling long sequences, while still maintaining the Transformer’s capability to understand the context behind complex ideas and statements in data.\n“This is also the first time that industry has successfully applied the Mamba architecture to the ultra-large Mixture of Experts model without damage,” Tencent said in its announcement.\nMixture of experts is a machine learning technique where multiple AI models are split apart according to distinct expertise and work together to solve problems.\nThe company also said the new architecture significantly reduces the training and deployment costs. With rival companies such as DeepSeek releasing competitive models at cheap prices this has driven Tencent and other companies slash service prices and research more efficient AI training and inference.\nTencent added as a flagship model , Turbo S will become core for foundation models in the future for inference, text and code generation.\nImage: SiliconANGLE/Microsoft Designer",
