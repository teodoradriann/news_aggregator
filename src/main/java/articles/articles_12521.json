    "text": "San Lorenzo fue inhibido por la FIFA por un reclamo de Yeison Gordillo y no podrá sumar refuerzos en este mercado de pases. Una noticia dura para el ciclón.\nSan Lorenzo de Almagro fue inhibido hoy por la FIFA e inhabilitado para incorporar nuevos jugadores, a raíz de un reclamo por una deuda del mediocampista colombiano Yeison Gordillo por un millón de dólares. ¿De qué se trata?\nADEMÁS: River rechazó ofertas por Pablo Solari y David Martínez El jugador, llegó al club de Boedo en 2021 a cambio de 1.400.000 dólares desde Deportes Tolima, de Colombia. En su paso por Boedo, terminó libre por la intervención de Futbolistas Argentinos Agremiados en su reclamo por la falta de pago del pase y una deuda salarial que el club tenía con el colombiano.\nLuego de una intimación inicial se logró negociar con los dirigentes azulgranas, más precisamente con la Comisión Directiva liderada por Horacio Arreceygor como presidente, ahora reemplazado por Marcelo Moretti, pero el club finalmente no pagó.\nLa inhibición le impide poor el momento a San Lorenzo realizar incorporaciones, con lo que las llegadas del volante uruguayo Santiago Viera y el defensor colombiano Jhohan Romaña quedaron suspendidas hasta la solución del conflicto.\nEn lo próximos días el flamante gobierno azulgrana, que tomó el mando recién el día de ayer luego del traspaso oficial que se llevó a cabo en el Polideportivo Roberto Pando de Boedo, deberá sentarse a revisar el caso y poder llegar a una mediación o apelar la sentencia para poder levantar la inhibición y utilizar a los jugadores adquiridos para este mercado de pases.\nPor otra parte, se confirmó la continuidad del ídolo Leandro Pipi Romagnoli como entrenador de la Reserva, luego de reunirse con el nuevo responsable del fútbol del club, el ex mediocampista Néstor Ortigoza y campeón de la Copa Libertadores.\nADEMÁS: Sebastián Grazzini fue presentado como DT de Platense La idea es continuar con el proyecto y seguir formando chicos para que la cantera del Ciclón explote y sea un semillero, no sólo para fortalecer la Primera, sino también para futuras ventas de aquellos jóvenes que pertenezcan a la institución.\nVideos relacionados: Aparecen en esta nota: San Lorenzo Yeison Gordillo FIFA",

    "text": "Blackstone Inc. ( BX Quick Quote BX - Free Report ) ended the recent trading session at $133.13, demonstrating a +0.39% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.04%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.03%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the investment manager had gained 19.07% over the past month. This has outpaced the Finance sector's gain of 8.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.28% in that time.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Blackstone Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.03, down 3.74% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $2.58 billion, indicating a 10.34% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $3.86 per share and a revenue of $9.74 billion, signifying shifts of -25.34% and -22.61%, respectively, from the last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Blackstone Inc. should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.46% lower. Blackstone Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).\nWith respect to valuation, Blackstone Inc. is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 34.33. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 11.46 for its industry.\nInvestors should also note that BX has a PEG ratio of 5.33 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial - Miscellaneous Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.16 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry is part of the Finance sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 174, positioning it in the bottom 31% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.",

    "title": "Trump obsessed with Biden like he just escaped 'bad relationship' with him: psychologist",
    "text": "Psychotherapist and lawyer\nNick Carmody couldn't help but notice some unique pieces of Donald Trump's policy address on the economy to air grievances about President Joe Biden not being his opponent.\nCarmody described it as being similar to a \"bad relationship.\"\nTaking to X on Thursday,\nCarmody responded to a question from neoconservative Bill Kristol about Trump's obsession with Biden.\n\"Maybe psychologists can explain the degree of Trump's strange identification with or co-dependency on Biden. In fighting Biden,\nTrump seems to have come to identify with him, so that's how he now takes Biden's failure as somehow a premonition of his own failure. Interesting if weird,\" Kristol observed after watching Trump's address. Read Also: A neuroscientist explains how Trump is using existential fear to win the election\nWhile no psychologist can definitively diagnose someone off of television, Carmody believes that what he sees is Trump's \"obsessive inability to let go of Biden... and the criticism surrounding Biden not running.\"\n\"First, anyone who’s been in a bad relationship where years of resentment builds up has experienced the phenomenon where the current action/statement the other person is criticizing you for isn’t really about the current action/behavior,\" he said. \"It’s just that the current action/behavior presents an opportunity to channel/focus that built up resentment/contempt for you.\"\nIt's akin to a person feeling frustrated and wanting to hurt someone else as a result.\n\"If you step right (in the non-political sense), you’re criticized for not stepping left,\" he continued. \"And if you had stepped left, you would have been criticized for not stepping right. It’s not about which direction you step, it’s about exploiting the opportunity to criticize/attack you.\"\nAt the same time, the Republican Party went all-in on the criticism of Biden's age, with many in the party calling him a barely sentient \"Weekend at Bernie's\"-style puppet.\nWith Biden out of the race, he noted, now questions about being too old turned to the 78-year-old Trump.\nThe other issue, he said, is \"\nTrump’s Cluster B personality disorders cause him to create alternate realities when actual reality threatens him, or violates his pathologically distorted concept of 'fairness.\"\nTrump has been allowed to operate this way his whole life \"because his resources have protected from experiencing consequences for his pathological behavior,\" argued Carmody , who added that others have \"enabled his pathological thinking/actions.\"\nEssentially, the psychologist believes that Biden leaving the race and changing the situation \"destabilized\" Trump and he's not handling it well.",

    "text": "Neige au Québec : les trois prochains rendez-vous seront manqués\nLa neige tombera en abondance partout, sauf au Québec.\nDans les prochains jours, trois gros systèmes vont encercler la Belle Province, sans jamais la toucher :\n1. Bourrasque de neige côtière\nLe premier système touchera la région des Grands Lacs dans le sud-est de l’Ontario en fin de semaine. Une bourrasque de neige côtière se produit lorsque la température de l’air est nettement inférieure à celle de l’eau, le contraste crée alors des précipitations abondantes. Ainsi, les secteurs près des Grands Lacs pourraient être ensevelis par la neige. Les accumulations ont d'ailleurs déjà débuté mercredi dernier : à l'est du lac Huron jusqu'à 60 cm sont tombés par endroits. Mais le Québec, loin des plans d’eau, restera hors de portée.\n2. Bombe météo dans les Maritimes\nLe deuxième système à surveiller se produira à l’est. Une bombe météo se prépare à frapper les Maritimes dans la nuit de samedi à dimanche. Pour rappel, ce phénomène se caractérise par une chute rapide de la pression atmosphérique, plus précisément au moins 24 mb en 24 heures. Comme souvent avec ce type de tempête, de fortes chutes de neige sont attendues dans les secteurs visés. Seules les Îles-de-la-Madeleine pourraient en ressentir les effets, alors que le reste du Québec sera épargné.\n3. Dépression du Colorado\nEnfin, un troisième système se formera au sud de la province. Cette dépression en provenance du Colorado affectera le nord-est des États-Unis : ces secteurs qui expérimentaient des carences de neige depuis le début de la saison pourraient recevoir quelques dizaines de centimètres de neige jusqu'à lundi soir. Bien que le sud du Québec soit à proximité, la neige devrait rester confinée à la frontière.\nLe Québec protégé\nComment se fait-il que tous les secteurs avoisinants aient de la neige, mais pas nous? Paradoxalement, c’est un système précédent qui protège actuellement le Québec. Celui-ci, après avoir [déversé une grande quantité de neige le jour de l’An](https://www.meteomedia.com/fr/nouvelles/meteo/previsions/jusqua-30-cm-de-nombreuses-sorties-de-route-et-la-tempete-se-poursuivra), se déplace vers le nord. Il repousse les perturbations en approche en agissant comme bouclier. Il faudra attendre encore un peu avant de retrouver un manteau blanc sur toute la province.\nAvec la collaboration de Stéphanie Bergeron, météorologue.",

    "text": "By Paul Krueger , Documenters contributor\nEvery public park in National City could have its own life-saving device for heart attack victims.\nIf the City Council approves a recommendation by an advisory committee, National City would be the first city in the county to install Automated External Heart Defibrillators in its parks, according to National City Fire Department Battalion Chief and paramedic Scott Robinson.\nThe city’s Parks, Recreation and Senior Citizen Advisory Committee endorsed the proposal during a meeting last month.\n“It’s a very simple device that is extremely easy to use,” said Jessica Robinson, a clinical educator and data analyst for the fire department.\nEven children can use the device to save the life of a heart attack victim, she said.\nAEDs are compact, portable devices designed to provide immediate and potentially life-saving treatment while the patient waits for paramedics. The device includes an audio recording in English or Spanish that tells the user how to apply the defibrillator. AEDs are already placed in the city’s libraries, fire stations and at City Hall, but they’re not accessible 24/7, as they would be in city parks.\nEvery year, Americans suffer approximately 450,000 cases of cardiac arrest outside a hospital setting, Battalion Chief Robinson told the committee. About 75,000 of those heart attacks happen in parks and other public places, he said. Placing AEDs in parks will increase survival rates because bystanders can take immediate action while waiting for paramedics.\nJessica Robinson said portable AEDs could be a game-changer for heart attack patients in her city. That’s because studies show that in low-income, primarily Hispanic communities, heart attack victims are “much less likely to receive CPR and assistance from community bystanders.”\nThe devices cost about $1,500 each, which committee member Joanne McGhee said is “very, very minimal.” McGhee and other committee members expressed support for the Fire Department’s proposal, which included a request for funding to apply for grants that would pay for the AEDs.\nCity of National City- Boards & Commissions – Parks, Recreation and Senior Citizen Advisory Committee 10_17_2024 Download This brief came from reporting by Jose Acevedo Amador, a San Diego Documenter, at a National City Parks, Recreation, and Senior Citizen Advisory Committee last month. The Documenters program trains and pays community members to document what happens at public meetings. It’s run by inewsource, a nonpartisan nonprofit newsroom dedicated to investigative and accountability journalism.

    "text": "La selección española ganó por primera vez a Francia con goles de\nAitana Bonmatí y Mariona Caldentey para alzarse como campeona de la Nations League y seguir rompiendo barreras. Las de Montse Tomé continúan siendo imbatibles mientras demuestran un extraordinario juego.\nDespués de levantar el trofeo y recibir las medallas, Jenni Hermoso lo celebró en los micrófonos de El larguero. La delantera de Tigres se mostró muy feliz y aseguró que este equipo no tiene techo: \"No hay quien nos pare, volvemos a ser campeonas y somos la leche\".\n\"No hay obstáculo que valga. La vida al final te da, volvemos a ser campeonas y lo vamos a celebrar muy y mucho desde aquí. Hemos acumulado muchas cosas\", añadió Hermoso.\nTodos los focos estaban puestos en ella después del caso Rubiales, lo que le ha servido a Jenni Hermoso también como aprendizaje. \"Desde hace 6 meses no soy la misma, vivo en paz y cada minuto disfruto del fútbol y trabajo mucho y me lo ha devuelto\", afirmó.\nLa futbolista volvió a defender al fútbol femenino asegurando que \"gusta por mucho que no quieran verlo así\" y ha dejado claro que en todo momento sabían que iban a ganar a Francia.\n\"Me ha costado mantenerme muy fuerte todo este tiempo y me sigo superando. Por supuesto me acuerdo de mi madre, de mi hermano... pero he luchado mucho y esta victoria me la voy a dedicar si o si porque creo que me la merezco\", aseguró.\nSobre los cambios que se han ido dando en la Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF) desde que estallase el caso Rubiales, Jennifer Hermoso cree que \"ha sido un proceso largo pero lo más importante es que la jugadora sepa que venga solo a disfrutar del fútbol\".",
