    "text": "Star actress Sandra Bullock has appeared in box office hits such as Bird Box, The Blind Side, and Bullet Train. However, the Oscar winner has been temporarily sidelined after suffering an injury.\nIt is still unclear what happened to the The Proposal star. But whatever occurred, it appears to be serious. Because TMZ cameras caught the actress leaving physical therapy on crutches.\nSandra Bullock Hobbles on Crutches, Going to Physical Therapy | Click to read more 👇— TMZ (@TMZ)\n [August 29, 2024]\nSandra Bullock Caught on Crutches\n“Sandra Bullock’s walking “Speed” has taken a hit … the actress is sporting a pair of crutches after suffering an undisclosed injury.\nThe Oscar winner was spotted leaving a physical therapy session in Santa Monica Wednesday … leaning on a pair of crutches while walking with an aide to her car nearby,”\nTMZ wrote.\n“The actress tried to keep a low profile … wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap and a gray sweatsuit to her appointment.\nAugust has clearly been a tough month for SB. On top of her apparent health issues, August marked the one-year anniversary of her partner Bryan Randall’s death.”\nThe Blind Side Star Calls Bluff on Film\nBullock has appeared in dozens of box-office hits throughout the years. But her claim to fame was when she played the role of Leight Anne Tuohy, in The Blind Side. It landed her the only Oscar award of her illustrious career.\nThe story follows the journey of NFL defensive lineman Michael Oher, who the Tuohy Family adopted after discovering he was homeless. The movie credits Michael’s journey to the NFL largely to the Tuohy’s. But Oher recently revealed that much of the content of the movie was fabricated. And thus brought legal action against the family.\nMichael Oher ‘Embarrassed’ By Film\n“The lie of Michael’s adoption is one upon which Co-Conservators Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sean Tuohy have enriched themselves at the expense of their Ward, the undersigned Michael Oher,”\nthe legal filing says.\n“Michael Oher discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023, when he learned that the Conservatorship to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact provided him no familial relationship with the Tuohys.”",

    "title": "Polite Passengers Cause Huge Delay When They Refuse To Confront Person In Wrong Seat",
    "text": "I will be the first to admit, I am not a fan of flying. It doesn't matter that I love traveling. It doesn't matter that I have flown more times than I can count, it is not an enjoyable experience for me. The planes are always over crowded, there is always at least one annoying passenger, and I get claustrophobic in the tight spaces. Let's not even begin to discuss turbulence or cabin pressure. However, this plane story is both humorous and annoying. One person decides to sit in the wrong seat on the plane and causes a huge domino effect when polite passengers refuse to address the issue. Then, this results in a huge delay...talk about starting your vacation off in the wrong way.\nPolite Passengers Cause Huge Delay Over Wrong Seat\nLook, I get it. Sometimes, mistakes are made. After all, the seats can be confusing to figure out sometimes. Especially if you are in a rush to board. However, there are also people out there who take full advantage of this situation by buying cheaper seats and then just selecting the one they want when they board the aircraft. Let's just say these passengers were nicer than me. If I paid for a seat, I am sitting in that seat....end of story.\nPEOPLE Magazine shares details from the entire airline debacle. Apparently, a passenger boarded the plane and chose to ignore her ticket and assigned seat. A fellow passenger shared, \"She was supposed to be in 30B, a middle seat, but decided to sit in the window seat, 37F.\" While I will admit that it is strange that she chose to sit further back, opting for a window over a middle seat is pretty common.\nRather than address the issue, the person who was supposed to sit in 37F chose not to confront her. Instead, they just found another seat. Apparently this plane was full of polite passengers who did not like confrontation. One after the other, they all chose to avoid conflict and just found themselves another seat, despite it being the wrong seat.\nFlight Attendants Get Involved\nEventually it got to the point where flight attendants had to get involved. After all, with over half of the plane in the wrong seat someone was bound to notice something. No matter how polite the passengers were. PEOPLE shared, \"Once the crew clocked the conundrum, they traced the flyers' boarding passes from wrong seat to wrong seat until they found the instigator.\" You can imagine the huge delay that this caused, to have to go through the seats one by one.\nWhen the instigator was finally found, she pleaded ignorance. Honestly, a smart move considering the entire plane was probably furious at her over the huge delay her shenanigans caused. I am not the only one who thinks this woman was lying through her teeth. Commenters on the Reddit post shared their personal opinions and stories of similar situations.\nOne user wrote, \"These people know what they are doing.\"\nAnother added their two cents. \"The other problem was the original 37F - should have call the other passenger out, because by being non-confrontational they then took someone else's seat, they were part of the problem.\"\nA third chimed in, \"I saw this happen where a wife and husband switched seats with a guy to sit together (both middle seats, so shouldn't have been an issue), but they were all in the wrong seats to begin with. Caused a huge delay on an already delayed flight.\"",

    "text": "Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake was condemned by nine of Arizona's 14 sheriffs Thursday as she attended an event for Donald\nTrump.\nWhile Lake was appearing at a Trump town hall event in Phoenix, the sheriffs sent a letter denouncing Lake for calling Sheriff Mark Lamb, a rival GOP candidate, a \"total coward\" for not bringing election fraud cases.\n\"Kari Lake's recent comment calling Sheriff Mark Lamb a 'coward' is both unfounded and disrespectful,\"\nthe group's letter said. \"We want to make it clear: neither Sheriff Mark Lamb nor any law enforcement officer who wears a badge and uniform, putting the life on the line every day to protect and serve our communities, is a coward. Arizona voters expect better from a political candidate, especially when they are running for the U.S. Senate.\"\nALSO READ:\n‘Journalistic dystopian nightmare’: Inside a Tennessee college media meltdown\nThe letter was signed by Sheriffs Mark Dannels, Adam Shepard, P.J. Allred, William Ponce, Russ Skinner, Doug Schuster, David Clouse, David Rhodes, and Leon Wilmot.\nLake\nmade the remark during a forum for Republican Senate candidates in May.\n\"I have fought for election integrity. I currently have cases in the courts and I know that (Lamb) doesn't think that I'm a fighter,\" Lake opined. \"There's not many people who have the ability to fight. I took every hit fighting for security in our elections. Sheriffs have the ability to fight, and the sheriff of Pinal County cowered. He's a total coward when it comes to election integrity.\"",

    "title": "GasBuddy sees gas prices dropping 13 cents a gallon across the US next year",
    "text": "Your buck is likely to take you on a little farther road trip next year.\nAt least that’s\nthe outlook from Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis and one of the most cited experts on gasoline prices.\nDe Haan is predicting a 13 cents a gallon drop in regular unleaded gas prices nationwide next year, along with the usual seasonal ups and downs seen every spring and summer. His 2023 prediction fell short by only 2 cents – $3.49 a gallon versus $3.51 in actuality.\n“Those seasonal trends are very well established,” he said. “But all in all, we expect a modest improvement.”\nFor 2024, De Haan is forecasting a high of $3.45 to $3.85 for Dallas-Fort Worth drivers – putting North Texas on par with cities like Houston, Atlanta and Cleveland. California drivers could see prices as high as $6.35 a gallon.\nAcross Texas, the yearly average will be anywhere from $2.88 to $3.18 a gallon. Across the country, the yearly average is predicted to be $3.38 a gallon.\nU.S. gas prices will be the lowest in the first three months and the last three months of next year, dropping as low as $2.99 on average in December, De Haan predicted.\nTexas tends to be one of the cheapest states to buy gas in the country, based on its location and taxes, De Haan said. Texas’ gasoline taxes are\namong the lowest in the nation.\nDe Haan cautioned his outlook with a caveat about how global conflicts or weather could disrupt production, rendering predictions moot.\n“As the world continues to navigate situations like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and violence in the Middle East, an elevated level of uncertainty remains, making an accurate forecast very challenging,” he wrote in his forecast. “These situations, as well as the fluid state of the global economy, fiscal policy by central banks to tame inflation, as well as potential interest rate cuts could alter the direction of the economy, shifting fundamentals in significant ways.”\nMuch like 2022,\nwhen Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted global oil production, gas prices depend on a global marketplace. Russia produces 10% of the global supply. This year, the global economy has seen slowing growth as central banks raised interest rates significantly, according to GasBuddy.\nAnother wildcard is electric vehicles, which reduce gasoline consumption. De Haan sees the nation’s EV transition slowing next year, especially with the heightened price of new vehicles. New EV prices averaged $51,762 in November – about 8% higher than gas-powered vehicles,\naccording to Kelley Blue Book data.\nWith another U.S. presidential election on the horizon, government policy surrounding EVs also could change.\nThe Biden Administration has offered federal tax credits to incentivize consumers to make a shift away from gas-powered cars and trucks.\n“Americans have obviously seen a good incentive to move over to electric vehicles, much of which is the fact that they were paying more to fill their tanks up in 2022 – a record-setting amount that they spent on gasoline,” De Haan said.\nAmericans are expected to spend $446.9 billion on gasoline next year, down over $32 billion from this year. GasBuddy attributes the drop to U.S. oil production’s recovery from the pandemic and declining risk from the war on Ukraine with Russia.\n©2023 The Dallas Morning News.

    "text": "Mapa celular de la piel da una clave para regenerarla y evitar cicatrices Podría revolucionar los trasplantes de piel, tanto en casos de quemaduras graves como en alopecia cicatricial. La piel, siendo el órgano más extenso del cuerpo humano, es fundamental para la medicina y las aplicaciones clínicas. Recientemente, un grupo de científicos ha desarrollado un atlas espacial y unicelular de la piel prenatal, proporcionando una especie de “guía molecular” para su construcción. Esta herramienta podría revolucionar los trasplantes de piel, tanto en casos de quemaduras graves como en alopecia cicatricial. Utilizando avanzadas técnicas de secuenciación unicelular y otras herramientas genómicas de última generación, los investigadores han logrado crear este mapa para desentrañar cómo se desarrolla[ la piel](https://www.elimparcial.com/tecnologia/2024/06/27/cientificos-japoneses-revelan-la-primera-cara-robotica-con-piel-humana/) y sus componentes, como los folículos pilosos. También han identificado los factores que intervienen cuando surgen enfermedades cutáneas. Adicionalmente, han diseñado un “mini-órgano” o organoide de piel para estudiar el papel de las células inmunitarias en la regeneración del tejido. Este estudio, dirigido por expertos del Instituto Wellcome Sanger y la Universidad de Newcastle (Reino Unido), ha sido publicado en la prestigiosa revista Nature. Forma parte de una ambiciosa iniciativa global, el Proyecto Atlas Celular Humano (HCA), que busca mapear todas las células del cuerpo humano para avanzar en nuestra comprensión de la salud y las enfermedades. La piel Con un promedio de dos metros cuadrados de extensión, la piel actúa como[ una barrera protectora](https://www.elimparcial.com/tecnologia/2024/09/07/magia-o-fisica-cientificos-encuentran-una-forma-de-hacer-la-piel-transparente/), regula la temperatura y tiene la notable capacidad de regenerarse. En el útero, la piel se desarrolla en un entorno estéril, formándose todos los folículos pilosos antes del nacimiento. Luego, la piel continúa su ciclo de renovación, pero sin crear nuevos folículos. Notablemente, la piel prenatal tiene la capacidad de cicatrizar sin dejar cicatrices, algo que se pierde tras el nacimiento, según el Instituto Wellcome Sanger. Para realizar este atlas, los investigadores analizaron muestras de piel prenatal, observando células individuales tanto en suspensión como en su contexto original dentro del tejido. Aplicaron técnicas genómicas para estudiar las células a través del espacio y el tiempo, descubriendo los cambios que regulan el desarrollo de la piel y los folículos pilosos. Además, utilizando células madre adultas, el equipo logró crear un organoide cutáneo capaz de producir cabello, lo que podría tener aplicaciones en la medicina regenerativa. Sin embargo, notaron que este modelo organoide se asemeja más a la piel prenatal que a la piel adulta, presentando dificultades en la formación de vasos sanguíneos. Al añadir macrófagos —células inmunitarias— al organoide, se observó una mejora en la formación de vasos sanguíneos, lo cual fue confirmado mediante imágenes en 3D del tejido. Si bien los macrófagos ya eran conocidos por proteger la piel de infecciones, este estudio revela por primera vez su papel en el desarrollo[ de la piel](https://www.elimparcial.com/tecnologia/2015/11/11/aumenta-uso-de-tecnologia-para-combatir-enfermedades-de-la-piel/) humana al promover el crecimiento de vasos sanguíneos en las primeras etapas de vida. También se identificaron pistas clave para combatir la alopecia cicatricial, un tipo de calvicie causada por la destrucción irreversible de los folículos pilosos. El estudio reveló que los macrófagos también juegan un papel crucial en la reparación de la piel prenatal sin cicatrices, lo que podría conducir a nuevas terapias para evitar la formación de cicatrices tras cirugías o heridas. Este trabajo ofrece una detallada “receta molecular” para la formación de la piel y de los folículos pilosos, conocimientos que podrían ser aprovechados para desarrollar nuevos tratamientos en medicina regenerativa, como trasplantes de piel o cabello para personas que han sufrido quemaduras graves o padecen alopecia cicatricial. El atlas prenatal de la piel también tiene el potencial de identificar cómo y cuándo se activan los genes responsables de trastornos congénitos de la piel y el cabello, como ampollas o piel escamosa. El estudio sugiere que estos genes ya se expresan en la piel durante la etapa prenatal, lo que indica que muchas de estas condiciones tienen su origen en el útero, indica EFE. Elena Winheim, del Instituto Wellcome Sanger, destacó que este atlas ofrece la primera guía molecular completa para la creación de piel humana, y sus hallazgos abren enormes posibilidades para la medicina regenerativa, incluyendo trasplantes de piel y cabello para quienes más lo necesitan. En datos - Científicos crearon un atlas unicelular de la piel prenatal que ofrece una “receta molecular” para su formación y reparación. - El estudio reveló cómo se desarrollan los folículos pilosos y cómo los macrófagos promueven la formación de vasos sanguíneos en la piel. - Se creó un organoide de piel capaz de hacer crecer pelo, con aplicaciones para trasplantes por quemaduras y alopecia cicatricial. - El atlas prenatal ayudará a identificar genes responsables de trastornos congénitos de la piel y cabello.

    "text": "Under the current and forecasted conditions, fire activity is expected to increase across northeast B.C. and the Fort Nelson area in particular. A dry cold front is expected to cross the Fort Nelson zone mid-afternoon Friday and, while no lightning is expected during this time, wind gusts may exceed 70 kilometres per hour and shift direction rapidly. These conditions are likely to contribute to continued new growth on [holdover fires](https://e1.envoke.com/ext/click/go/cd9c027cc919cff110a615ccfdf58a6b/db55fa33609c0da5d5c663d66bdcd88c/74a344ff49639febcb75305807ecc77e) from the 2023 season, resulting in visible smoke from Fort Nelson and along the Alaska Highway and Highway 77 corridors. Observed fire activity in the Fort Nelson zone is heavily influenced by local conditions, including the [persistent drought](https://e1.envoke.com/ext/click/go/cd9c027cc919cff110a615ccfdf58a6b/0808534171b44eddd91663d66bdcdb2b/74a344ff49639febcb75305807ecc77e) experienced across the Prince George Fire Centre since the fall of 2022. Reports from personnel also indicate that conditions around active fire areas are more typical of those seen in the late summer, with danger trees and ash pits challenging fire suppression activities that would normally be taking place. The top priorities of the BC Wildfire Service are life, health and safety of responders and public. The Prince George Fire Centre is actively working with municipal partners, industry and other government ministries to ensure these priorities are achieved. An Incident Management Team (IMT) will be assuming command in the zone effective Friday, May 10, 2024 and additional resources are on standby through the weekend. To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1-800-663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cell phone, or directly through the BC Wildfire Service mobile app. Follow the latest wildfire news on: [X (formerly Twitter)](https://e1.envoke.com/ext/click/go/cd9c027cc919cff110a615ccfdf58a6b/7588294d19bf40305a2663d3dd65f664/74a344ff49639febcb75305807ecc77e) [YouTube](https://e1.envoke.com/ext/click/go/cd9c027cc919cff110a615ccfdf58a6b/6fce2198ccac0108063663d3dd65fd48/74a344ff49639febcb75305807ecc77e) - The free BCWS mobile app (for [Apple](https://e1.envoke.com/ext/click/go/cd9c027cc919cff110a615ccfdf58a6b/76bfcfd5c40ed5d60cc663d3dd6600a0/74a344ff49639febcb75305807ecc77e)and [Android](https://e1.envoke.com/ext/click/go/cd9c027cc919cff110a615ccfdf58a6b/0d72e4315f264bb0d16663d3dd6603fd/74a344ff49639febcb75305807ecc77e)devices)",
