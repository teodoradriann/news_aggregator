    "title": "Bake It Till You Make It: Dayna Altman's Success Story",
    "text": "Walking onto the extremely well-groomed grounds of the White House, I sensed my world shift. It was May 2022, and I was among a group of 30 mental health advocates attending the first Mental Health Youth Action Forum, a two-day gathering devoted to generating ideas for [supporting youth mental health](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/natural-mental-health-how-to-support-anxious-teens/). I’d been invited because of my work with Bake It Till You Make It, the company I founded that uses food and baking as a means for authentic storytelling. I’ll never forget the fancy seals on the paper towels or the pressure I felt as I spoke about my work and ideas — just a few feet away from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, First Lady Jill Biden, and Selena Gomez. Most of all, I’ll never forget the pride and relief that washed over me. I’d struggled with [ imposter syndrome](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/who-me/) and feelings of inadequacy for years; being invited to the forum helped me finally take myself seriously. Cracks in the Egg Growing up, I was considered a triple threat — an actor, singer, and dancer. I was an active, involved kid, and from an outsider’s perspective, I was thriving. Inside was a different story: I felt a lot of anxiety and shame. At the time, I didn’t have the words for the challenges I was facing, but now I know I was struggling with [obsessive-compulsive disorder](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/understanding-ocd/), anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder. Many factors amplified my mental health struggles. I grew up in a small suburban town where there was a lot of privilege, and [ I never thought that I fit in or was good enough](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/never-good-enough-2/). I felt pressure to look a certain way and be perfect at everything I did. I also watched my mother count calories and try other dieting strategies, the results of which elicited praise from those around her. I wanted my mother to be proud of my body, so I began restricting my food intake too. But my body never looked the way I thought it should, which led to feelings of shame and further restriction. I believed I would gain self-worth from flawlessness. This mindset followed me into college, where I began my long, tough journey toward recovery. I attended multiple inpatient programs for eating disorders and suicidal thoughts but made no progress. I wasn’t yet ready to take a deeper look at how my past affected my present or change some of my behaviors, like the way I was eating. The Binding Agents In March 2012, I attended another inpatient program after taking a medical leave from college. This time, I connected emotionally with a therapist who supported me throughout the tough, internal work of recovery. I also felt like I had nothing to lose; I had already [ tried and failed](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/failure-is-an-option/) before. I committed myself to the process, which included intense dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), group therapy, and closer management of the medications I was taking. After finishing the program, I transferred to another college, where I found like-minded people who were motivated by education and interested in advocacy. I started doing work supporting survivors of sexual violence. My advocacy work gave me a sense of empowerment, and I graduated in 2015 with the help and support of my therapist. Shortly after, I began working as a community residence counselor and DBT educator at a hospital where I’d attended inpatient treatment programs. Time to Rise A series of events while attending grad school for public health took me back to my family home in the summer of 2017, when I started baking to pass the time. I invited friends over, and we talked about our days and mental health as we baked and ate together. The first treats I baked with an old friend were cupcakes from a boxed cake mix. They were so simple, but I noticed I felt especially connected to my friend during the experience. It was easier to be vulnerable when we were creating something delicious together. I continued to connect through baking: It gave me a window into other people’s unique mental health stories — stories I’d been missing when I began to look toward recovery. There are so many sites out there with textbook-type information: definitions, charts, and numbers to call. But reading all that couldn’t compare with hearing about an individual’s experience firsthand. Food [can] be a powerful vehicle for meaningful storytelling. That’s when I realized food could be a powerful vehicle for meaningful storytelling. I decided to write a cookbook that would give other people a chance to share their stories. I put out a call for recipes and stories and received more than 40 responses. Each recipe was paired with a personal story that highlighted the individual’s resilience. I included [mental health resources](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/mental-health/) like hotline numbers and websites, and I added descriptions of what it was like to use the programs and services. The final product, Bake It Till You Make It, was published in 2019. Afterward, I created a company by the same name and started doing presentations in schools and community centers, where I told my story using baking ingredients as metaphors. When I talked about difficult times in college, I cracked an egg to represent my feeling of brokenness. When I referenced my therapist, I poured in a can of sweetened condensed milk to show how my work in therapy helped bind my own ingredients into something wonderful. [I continued to grow my offerings leading up to the forum at the White House in 2022, where I met someone who wanted to create a documentary about my work. A few months later, they followed me around to different events and interviewed my family and some of the people I had mentored.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26443768/) [The Bake It Till You Make It documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26443768/) premiered in October 2023, on World Mental Health Day. My hope is that it encourages people to tell their stories and demonstrate that they can live full, purposeful lives even if they struggle with their mental health. Nothing to Prove With my eating disorder, I never felt like I could talk about or enjoy food. It was too [riddled with shame](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/4-steps-to-let-go-of-guilt-and-shame/). But the work that I’ve done with Bake It Till You Make It has changed my perception. I’ve seen the connective power of food, and it’s the vehicle through which I’ve chosen to talk about mental health. It’s the way that I can change the world; knowing that has helped me [find peace in my relationship with food](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/6-ways-to-simplify-and-improve-your-relationship-with-food/) and reach a point of [body neutrality](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/what-is-body-neutrality-and-how-can-i-embrace-it/). I’m still working on myself at 31. I’ve learned that creating a beautiful life is like baking a cake. You start off unsure. Some things, like baking powder, need to be measured precisely, while other elements, such as chocolate icing, may vary depending on taste. Practice brings confidence and new opportunities, which can make for delicious new creations. I’m getting married in September, and I’m dreaming about where Bake It Till You Make It can go next. These are exciting things to anticipate, but I know that life will always have cracked eggs. That’s why I feel so thankful for the support system and sense of empowerment I have cultivated to make it — and bake it — through life. Dayna’s Top 3 Takeaways - Find resources. “Understanding the support available to you will be extremely handy when you or someone you care about needs help,” Dayna notes. - Question “normal.” Not all norms serve us. “Question what you’ve normalized in your life and how it impacts your health,” she says. - Know that mental health looks different for everyone. Dayna learned there is no one-size-fits-all solution to mental health challenges. “Try different things,” she advises, “and stay patient on your journey.” Tell Us Your Story!

    "text": "It doesn’t take long to understand why Taylor Schepp’s career trajectory has only pointed up.\nThe Dakota Lancers’ point guard is all business when it comes to basketball, and it shines when she’s on the floor.\n“She’s as true as it gets as a point guard. Plays with a high motor, great shooter, great passer, and probably one of the best kids I’ve ever coached with her IQ for the game,” said Lancers head coach Eric Sung, who has headed the women’s varsity program for the last decade.\nSchepp, the daughter of University of Manitoba Bisons men’s basketball head coach Kirby Schepp, was named the top women’s hoopster in the Free Press ’ annual coaches poll of the top 10 high school players in the province due to her dynamic ability on the floor, but it’s the Grade 12’s dedication off the court that is rare for someone her age and has drawn rave reviews.\nMIKAELA MACKENZIE / FREE PRESS FILES\nDakota Lancers’ Taylor Schepp (right) is all business when it comes to basketball. Her head coach, Eric Sung, said she’s ‘probably one of the best kids I’ve ever coached with her IQ for the game.’\n“Her separator is her work ethic and her love of the game. She’s always loved the work. She’s always loved putting in time,” said Kirby, who has intentionally remained in a supporting role throughout his daughter’s career. “In my over 30 years being involved in coaching, I’m not sure I’ve had an athlete that’s worked harder at the game than her.”\nSchepp naturally gravitated to basketball after being in a gym from a young age (Kirby used to wear a BabyBjörn while coaching the provincial team). She immersed herself in the game as a pre-teen, watching film with her dad, breaking down strategies and running drills in her backyard.\nHer commitment reached a new high during the pandemic when she used the extra time at home to hone her skills. There’s one month Kirby remembers vividly.\n“It was a February, and she had a goal of 100 workouts in a month, and a workout had to be at least 20 to 30 minutes of concentrated… effort in a certain area, working on a skill,” he said.\n“Her separator is her work ethic and her love of the game. She’s always loved the work. She’s always loved putting in time.” –Kirby Schepp\n“That works out to a little over… three a day, and I think she got 110 or something. She averaged almost four a day. That’s just an example of: she picks a goal, and it’s often a process-oriented goal, and goes for it. And the payoff of doing that over many, many years is she got better.”\nSchepp is the focal point of a Lancers team that is seeking an unprecedented fourth-straight AAAA provincial title. Dakota was two wins away from that feat as it prepared to face the Garden City Gophers in Wednesday’s semi-final.\nWhile Schepp’s ability on the offensive end has earned her the most attention — she rose to prominence after scoring 54 points and being named MVP in a 74-67 win over Maples in the provincial AAAA junior varsity championship final in 2023 — she’s more thrilled about her improvement on the defensive end.\nFree Press Top 10\nA list compiled with voting from a panel of 10 high school coaches.\n1. Taylor Schepp, point guard\nDakota Lancers, Grade 12\nProfile: She is an offensively dynamic point guard with an explosive first step, she has a deadly pull up jumper and has excellent range from the three-point line. She has great basketball IQ and court vision and can often beat any press with her ball handling abilities.\nClick to read more 1. Taylor Schepp, point guard\nDakota Lancers, Grade 12\nProfile: She is an offensively dynamic point guard with an explosive first step, she has a deadly pull up jumper and has excellent range from the three-point line. She has great basketball IQ and court vision and can often beat any press with her ball handling abilities.\n2. Lilly Vande Graaf, guard\nVincent Massey Trojans, Grade 12\nProfile: A devastating presence at the top of their 1-3-1 full court press, her long athletic frame causes so many turnovers and deflections in the full court which often leads to open layups for herself or her teammates. Offensively she likes to play out on the perimeter where she uses her court awareness by slashing to the rim or finding teammates for open looks. She has developed a consistent jump shot and three-point shot. She has good touch around the rim.\n3. Jennifer Edwards, guard\nVincent Massey Trojans, Grade 12\nProfile: She is an energetic guard that can get to the rim but can also hit the open jump shot or three ball. She is arguably one of the best one ball defenders in the province, with her active hands and body control she can easily strip her opponents of the ball or force turnovers in the open court.\n4. Martha Lado, guard\nKildonan-East Reivers, Grade 12\nProfile: Hard working player, with good range and a good first step. Physical guard that likes to push the ball in transition and tries to find different ways to get to the hoop. Can be a deadly scorer when left wide open and she can drain a three-point shot from any range.\n5. Jenelle Deato, guard\nGarden City Gophers, Grade 12\nProfile: She is a crafty guard that plays bigger than her size, with good ball handing skills which often creates offensive opportunities for herself and her teammates. She is an up-tempo type of player, that likes to push in transition which often leads to transition baskets.\n6. Eliana Stark, post\nMiles Macdonell Buckeyes, Grade 12\nProfile: An outstanding athlete has just scratched the surface of her basketball potential as she moves to focus on her development on the court. She likes to run the floor and get the easy finish at the rim. Tough physical presence in the paint, her agility allows her to alter shots and grab multiple rebounds. She has excellent touch around the rim.\n7. Emilie McLean, forward\nDakota Lancers, Grade 11\nProfile: A hard-working player that continues to develop her game. Her improvement on making the correct offensive reads have led to her scoring multiple baskets and being a force on the rebounding glass. She has an athletic defensive presence in the paint and can alter shots and grab multiple rebounds on the offensive and defensive ends of the floor.\n8. Ann Celeste, point guard\nSisler Spartans, Grade 12\nProfile: A true shooting guard and at only five-feet tall she can find different ways to get to the hoop. She has excellent shooting range and when she gets going has a deadly jump shot. She is a good on ball defender with active hands which often lead to deflections and steals.\n9. Avneet Kainth, guard\nMaples, Grade 12\nProfile: A dynamic guard that can get to the rim and has unbelievable shooting range. She likes to push the ball in transition and can find time and space to get her shot off uncontested.\n10. Emma Elliott, guard\nJeanne-Sauvé Olympiens, Grade 11\nProfile: Hard working player, with good range and a good first step. Physical guard that likes to push the ball in transition and tries to find different ways to get to the hoop. A leader at both ends of the floor as she helps her team create looks to score and create steals.\nHonourable Mentions:\nYar Mach, post\nJohn Taylor Pipers, Grade 11\nHalle Penner, forward\nSanford Sabres, Grade 11\nClose “For me, that used to be more just contain the ball and try not to get beat, kind of situation for me. But I think now I’m somebody who I’ve worked really hard on getting stronger and my IQ and being able to anticipate on defence, and now I think I’m somebody who can really bother the ball and be a little bit more annoying on defence,” she said.\nSchepp can still take over a game with her scoring, though she prefers to facilitate. She has the ball in her hands on most possessions and dictates the pace of the Lancers offence.\n“I think she’s a scorer at multiple levels now,” said Sung. “She was mainly a pass-first point guard for us last year, and then flipped to this year now, she’s had some large offensive games for us where she’s making big plays, but then she’s also making the right play.\n“If they send multiple bodies at her to stop her, she’s going to make the right pass, she’s going to make the right play and give somebody else the opportunity to reap the benefits of her drawing attention to herself.”\nSchepp was heavily recruited by several Canadian universities but chose a familiar spot with the Bisons, where she will play for Sung’s wife, Michele, this fall.\nHer sights are set on something bigger, though, and that continues to drive her chase to becoming an all-around player.\n“It’s extremely important to me. I think for me, being a good high school player is not my end goal. I know to be a really great university player, and a goal of mine is to later play professionally, so I think to be able to get to those goals, I’m going to have to be a really good defender and improve offensively and continue to get better every year,” she said.\nThe Lancers have featured some talent-laden rosters with players that have gone on to play U Sports during its recent stretch of championships, including Kyu and Izzi Fust, Darya Rom and Abby Sweeny, but this is the first time Schepp will be the one leading the charge.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Mike McIntyre | On Sports Thursdays\nKeep up to date on sports with Mike McIntyre's weekly newsletter.\nSign up for Mike McIntyre | On Sports Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . Ask anyone, including Schepp, and they’ll say these are the games she’s prepared herself for.\n“I know I’m ready for these moments. And it’s not all about me,” Schepp said.\n“I’m going to have the ball in my hands, but I want to make sure that our team is at the best that it can be. And so whether that be defending the best player, or scoring or setting up other girls for easy baskets and putting us in positions where we’re going to be successful, is something that I look to do in these big games.”\njoshua.frey-sam@freepress.mb.ca",
