    "title": "La DANA deja ya más de 100 litros en la zona mallorquina de Ponent",
    "text": "El temporal que ha arrasado Valencia llega a Mallorca. Tras dejar precipitaciones intensas en Ibiza y Formentera, la DANA está descargando descargando con fuerza en parte de la isla.En la zona de Ponent se han registrado ya más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado. Las intensas lluvias, además, han provocado inundaciones importantes en Calvià, donde la crecida del torrent de Galatzò ha obligado además a cerrar al tráfico de un tramo de la Ma-101. Los municipios más afectados por las lluvias son, de momento, Galilea, Puigpunyent, Andratx y Calvià. Precisamente en este último, se han producido algunas inundaciones, cortes de calles y desprendimientos en carreteras, que han obligado a movilizar a Policía Local y efectivos municipales. El ayuntamiento de Calvià ha informado del corte al tráfico de un tramo de la Ma-101, la carretera de Calvià a es Capdellà, que se ha inundado por desbordamiento del torrente de Galatzó y de varias vías en Palmanova y Magaluf. La Policía Local y operarios municipales trabajan en las zonas afectadas. Se espera que en las próximas horas la dana se desplace por gran parte de Mallorca, dejando importantes precipitaciones a su paso. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología recuerda que Mallorca se encuentra en alerta naranja por precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, llegando a acumularse 120 litros por metro cuadrado en algunas zonas de la isla en pocas horas. Las lluvias se mantendrán hasta el sábado 2 de noviembre, alargándose el aviso naranja hasta primera hora de la mañana. Con el avance de las horas la alerta desaparecerá, pero las precipitaciones se mantendrán a lo largo del día. El paso peatonal del paseo Marítimo de Palma entre el Palacio de Congresos y el Parc de la Mar permanece cerrado este viernes por el mal tiempo. Así lo ha informado el departamento de Carreteras del Consell de Mallorca en un mensaje en redes recogido por Europa Press. Cabe recordar que en Palma, desde las 14.00 horas de este viernes están cerrados los parques y los cementerios. Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en Mallorca y Menorca. El paso peatonal del paseo Marítimo de Palma entre el Palacio de Congresos y el Parc de la Mar permanece cerrado este viernes por el mal tiempo. Así lo ha informado el departamento de Carreteras del Consell de Mallorca en un mensaje en redes recogido por Europa Press.

    "text": "Today is Easter Friday, the momentous day that Jesus Christ was crucified on the Cross at Golgotha. Christians like me will use this day to prayerfully reflect on the sacrifice by the Son of Man who paid the ultimate price to save humanity from her collective mortal frailties and inadequacies. For me, the seminal biblical verse during Easter has always been that utterance on the Cross when Jesus calmly muttered: ” Tetelestai ” ( It is Finished ) as He bowed His head and committed His spirit to His Father ( John 19 verse 30 ). The seminal utterance ” It is finished ” or Tetelestai denotes an accomplished mission. Jesus Christ was the human form of God who came to live like— and among—the rest of us. He had taught the gospel and lived it; He had performed many miracles, healing the sick and the lame and addressing the concerns of the infirm. As He hung on the Cross at Calvary, It is finished was a valedictory statement that marked the successful accomplishment of His earthly mission. It is pertinent to note that Tetelestai was not a frightful utterance by a helpless martyr. It is Finished was actually a bold statement of satisfaction upon the completion of one’s mission and purpose. Today’s Easter Friday has come on the 29th of March, yet another historic day in Zimbabwe’s political story. On the 29th of March 2008, Zimbabweans collectively voted and won the country for change . The resultant inclusive government, with Morgan Tsvangirai as Prime Minister, spawned massive positive change in the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans in a way and manner that will always be etched in stone. Today, with ED’s incompetence spanning across the sectors, that glorious past and the positive vibe actuated by the competent hand of Morgan Tsvangirai and team in the inclusive government is long gone, swept away by the cruel avalanche of history. It is finished. The prospect for a brighter future—whose foundation was laid down between 2009 and 2013—has been utterly vanquished by ZANU PF’s perennial penchant to violently foist itself on the prople. All the positive vibe induced into the country by the inclusive government has been ewashed away by the torrents of a cruel lot that rode into our lives through a coup. There is certainly no prospect for a better future anymore under Zanu PF. It is finished. We are holding this year’s Easter festivities when all pretence that we have a prudent government in place has since been comprehensively busted. It is finished. The Gold Mafia documentary has since shown that what we have in office is a kleptocracy, a government of thieves. As a country, the kleptocratic network plundering our vast extractive mineral wealth is quite a spectacle. It spans from the very apex of the State through associated nieces such as Henrietta Rushwaya to criminal underworld characters such as Scott Sakupwanya, Ewan Macmillan and Simon Rudland, right down to a fake comic pastor and ambassador who blasphemously carries the name of an Angel (pun intended). In the Cabinet sculpted after stealing the 2023 election that was condemned by all observer missions including SADC, ED appointed his son David and his nephew Tongai as Ministers, dashing all hopes of a diverse ensemble of characters of high probity in the Executive. There is no snowball’s chance in Hell that this retinue of known thieves and criminals could be called a people’s government. All faith that we have a prudent government in place has now been irretrievably lost. It is finished. The Vene language in which a close-knit parasitic elite of thieves and lootocrats now “own” the country has busted the myth that we have a people’s government in Zimbabwe. All the pretence is gone. It is finished. Indeed, Vene (the owners) are now firmly in charge . Only two days ago, Mnangagwa was officially commissioning Champion Foods, a multimillion dollar milling empire that he probably owns but has allowed a relative to front it, an unknown guy called Patrick Mnangagwa who only curiously emerged this week as a millionaire and a businessman. There’s no prize for guessing that this hitherto unknown businessman who sprung from nowhere is a front. We all know the real thief hiding behind Patrick. On the eve of Easter Friday, we are always reminded that it is possible for some among us to congregate and nominate a robber or a thief as a saint, just as happened when a huge crowd on the eve of Jesus’ crucifixion nominated a celebrated robber, one Barrabbas, to be saved ahead of the Son of Man. Indeed, Mr Mnangagwa, the Barrabas of our time as confirmed by the Gold Mafia documentary and his motley thieving acolytes such as Sakupwanya, Uebert Angel, Java and Chivayo, are today being ashamedly touted in some dark quarters as Idols and icons at the expense of the real hard and honest workers of our land who deserve respect and emulation. Indeed, the era of praising and lauding hard work and honest sweat is long gone. It is finished. Gone is the era of guys with traceable wealth such as Strive Masiyiwa, Enock Kamushinda, Nigel Chanakira and even the hard working bus operators who were behind brands such as Shiri Wekutanga, Matambanadzo, Mazarura and Kukura Murehwa, among many others. There has emerged a suspicious group of tenderpreneurs who have become rich overnight only by dint of their political connections. This kleptocratic lot of tenderpreneurs includes one Wicknell Chivayo, whose marriage ended this week. Oh yes, it is finished! He failed to deliver in the generation of electricity for the country in the multi-million dollar Gwanda Solar project, despite being paid millions of taxpayers’ money in advance to which the country has yet to get any value. Ironically, just as he failed to provide solar powered electricity to the nation, it now has emerged that Chivayo equally failed dismally to generate the electrical spark to sustain his own marriage. No electricity to the nation, no electric spark in his own marriage! On another note and only very recently, celebrated imposter Sengezo Tshabangu was photographically exposed as a paid Mnangagwa charlatan. All his fulminations and pretence to being a change champion have been exposed as a huge lie. It is finished. Tshabangu infamously exposed his surrogate and poopy politics at the Pupu battle memorial site in Lupsne. The sight of a stupidly grinning Tshabangu as he zealously shook Mnangagwa’s hand glaringly exposed his treacherous, puppetry politics. Only a cheap puppet greeting his political master could afford such a foolish grin. Tshabangu’s claim to the legitimacy of his cause has now been glaringly exposed. It is finished. Our nation is yet again almost on the verge of starvation after the government had lied as recently as January 2024 that the country had enough food stocks to feed the country. Now that the skies have passed their own rain sanctions and the silos have turned out to be empty contrary to the government’s pronouncements, there’s no longer any prospect of a food secure nation. It is finished. Indeed, we have become an anxious nation, thanks to the incompetence of the appropriately named Anxious Masuka, ED’s agriculture Minister. Incompetence begets incompetence. Surprisingly, the incompetent regime had the temerity to name the same Anxious Masuka as the best performing Minister in government! Surely, there can’t be a competent Minister in an incompetent government. There’s certainly no best student in a failing class. Indeed, there’s no virgin in a maternity ward. As stated earlier, the seminal Easter verse that is the theme of this week’s instalment denotes completeness and fulfilment of a vocation. It marks and expresses the accomplishment of a mission. And Mnangagwa appears to have completed his mission to bring together his children, relatives and friends and to name them as government. That mission has now been completed. It is finished. ED’s primitively personal mission to “clanitise” and “villagise” the State and government will sooner or later come to haunt him. What we essentially now have in place is to a very large extent a family gathering masquerading as a government. A few years ago. I named over 20 of Mnangagwa’s cousins, uncles, nephews, nieces, clansmen, tribesmen and tribeswomen that he has appointed to Cabinet and deployed to the party, to quasi-State institutions, to provincial ministries and other strategic bodies to represent petty personal, factional and clique interests. The pretence and notion that this villager they call ED is a statesman has now been sufficiently quashed. It is finished. Mnangagwa’s blood-soaked tenure has been in no way a Second Republic but an insidious and more callous continuation of the First Republic under Robert Mugabe. What is only second about this so-called Second Republic is that the tyranny level is second to none! This regime has simply perished its own mantra that it is a new dispensation. The pretence to novelty and “newness” has now been utterly busted . It is finished. The Mnangagwa government has been claiming that it represents a break from the past, which past was evidenced by a clear State/Party conflation during the Robert Mugabe years. But with political defectors that we saw being hosted at State House, Mnangagwa has confirmed he cannot tell the difference between the State and the party and the distinct business that ought to be transacted either at State House or at the party headquarters. Party business ought to be done at the party headquarters while State House belongs to the State and should not be a venue of promoting and pursuing petty and partisan interests. Indeed, under Emmerson Mnangagwa, the distinction between State and party has now been completely obliterated. It is finished. Under Mnangagwa, State House is now shorn and bereft of the dignity associated with the Presidential residences the world over. Under ED, State House at one time became a prime parade square of defecting mercenaries from the opposition in the process demeaning and belittling the value of the supreme house of the State. . The whole presidium became a bunch of political touts who ranted and raved at the political terminus called State House in cheap defection skits that were even broadcast on national television. The President and his deputy reduced themselves to political touts at State House — mahwindi – whom we invariably heard hollering and shouting, exhorting innocent Zimbabweans to come and board their ramshackle political bus called Zanu PF on a doomed trip to Hell. State House became akin to a bustling taxi rank —-a hive for pirate taxis popularly known as mushika shika where a whole President and his 2 IC sonorously shouted during the well-choreographed defection sessions as they vended and marketed Zanu-PF as the ultimate political transport to a doomed destination. By those actions, the dignity of State House is long gone ‘. It is finished. As we commemorate the crucifixion of the Son of Man today, let us remember heinous acts the Mnangagwa regime has committed in the past few years since its gunnified entrance on the political dais in November 2017. The callous murders of innocent citizens, the arbitrary arrests, the State-sanctioned abductions, the highly toxic and undeserved recalls, the closure of democratic space and the deliberate onslaught on the legitimate opposition in order to create a one-party-State are all well documented. Jesus Christ may have been crucified on this day but Mnangagwa too has equally crucified the last vestiges of whatever crucibles of democracy were still remaining in Zimbabwe. Mnangagwa has captured all institutions of the State including the sacred pillars of democracy such as the Judiciary and Parliament as well as all independent Chapter 12 institutions. Just as they nailed Jesus Christ on the cross on this day, Mnangagwa is equally nailing the last remnants of democracy on the cross of political expediency. There is neither an iota nor a semblance of democracy still left in the entire body politic. It is finished. Zvapera . For me, the dictum It is finished will always remain a memorable Easter verse. It denotes accomplishment of a mission, the dusting up after the execution of one’s mandate. Anyway, the sports are finished for this instalment of my weekly column. Tetelestai . It is finished.

Ce moment spectaculaire allie contrôle et chance pour un sauvetage de dernière minute.\nLe rattrapage impressionnant d'une Twingo en pleine course\nLors d'une course de\nrallye amateur sur une route de campagne, un pilote de Twingo a vécu une expérience à couper le souffle. Lancé à pleine vitesse, il a failli perdre le contrôle de son véhicule à la sortie d'un virage serré. Les routes de campagne, souvent étroites et sinueuses, représentent un défi important pour les conducteurs. Surtout lors de courses où la vitesse est élevée.\nCe pilote, aux commandes d'une Renault Twingo 3, a dû affronter une série de virages serrés après une sortie de virage rapide. Mal préparé pour ce changement soudain de la route, il a manqué de peu de finir dans le décor. La petite voiture, dopée pour la course, a démontré toute la difficulté de maîtriser un véhicule à haute vitesse sur des routes imprévisibles.\nComme on peut le voir sur la vidéo ci-dessus, le virage ne semblait pas si serré. Il a tout de même réussi à déstabiliser la Twingo, un véhicule pourtant réputé pour son châssis de qualité. Mais il faut dire qu'à une telle vitesse, aucune erreur n'est permise.\nUne perte de contrôle surprenante dans un virage compliqué\nLe pilote a tout de même le mérite d'avoir brillamment rattrapé son véhicule de course avec une maîtrise impressionnante. Il a perdu l'arrière de sa Twingo et la voiture a tourné à 360° sans rien toucher autour. Pourtant, un fossé était proche. Mais le véhicule est resté sur la route tout au long de la perte de contrôle. Finalement, le pilote n'a même pas eu besoin de s'arrêter avant de reprendre la course. Comme si rien ne s'était passé.\nLe conducteur a fait preuve d'un sang-froid exemplaire lors de cette manœuvre qui n'était pas gagnée d'avance. Mais lorsque l'on connaît et maîtrise son véhicule, c'est plus simple d'éviter ce genre d'accidents. Même si rien n'est garanti.\nSuite à ce petit incident, le pilote devait tout de même retrouver une concentration optimale afin de continuer sa course et tenter de réaliser le meilleur chrono possible. Même en ayant perdu un peu de temps sur cette manœuvre inhabituelle. Dans tous les cas, il a régalé les spectateurs proches et ceux qui ont pu observer son exploit sur les réseaux sociaux.",

    "title": "Yemen’s Bitter Anniversary: How the September Revolution Continues to Divide the Nation",
    "text": "Taiz Today, Thursday, September 26 was the 62nd anniversary of the Yemeni revolution, amid a sharp political divide that left a marked difference in the celebration of such a national occasion, in a country torn apart by war. About 10 years.\nThe September 26, 1962 revolution began against the Imamate regime that had ruled northern Yemen for decades, while the south of the country was under British colonial control.\nA few days ago, the anniversary of the revolution began to be celebrated, amid great momentum in areas controlled by the Yemeni government, as opposed to areas under the control of the Houthis, which have witnessed an intense security deployment, denying any. Gathering to celebrate this occasion. The group faced human rights and government charges for arresting activists calling for revolution anniversary celebrations.\nthrough his account\nInstead, a member of the Houthis’ Supreme Political Council, Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, responded to the accusations by challenging the Yemeni government to celebrate the event in the city of Aden, which is controlled by the Southern Transitional Council, which claims to separate the country’s south from the north.\n● The rise of the terrorist Houthi militia linked to Iran, the kidnapping campaign that has targeted hundreds of sheikhs, academics, politicians, media personalities, journalists and activists active on social media sites over the past few days to force its control, is an attempt to terrorize citizens and prevent preparedness.. . pic.twitter.com/qUpLd82yF1\n– Muammar Al-Eryani (@ERYANIM) September 23, 2024\nCelebration as a political message The division in geographic and military control between the Yemeni government, Houthi groups and the Southern Transitional Council has made it difficult to find unity of position on many issues, including national events.\nIn this regard, political analyst Abdul Wase’ Al-Fataki said in a statement to Al Jazeera Net, “This year the twenty-sixth revolution witnessed a great division among Yemenis on its anniversary and the difference of views between those who support the celebration. This revolution and those who oppose it. The geography between Yemeni lands and territories results in one controlled by an internationally recognized government and the other under the control of the Houthis.”\nAl-Fateqi noted that the growing celebrations in government-controlled areas “are a clear political message that what the Houthi group wants will not be achieved, and there are popular masses who reject it and what it wants to impose on Yemenis. Its political ideology or Orientation.”\nOn the other hand, the political analyst noted that “the Houthi group believes that celebrating the revolution in their region is considered a message of support for the internationally recognized government and also represents a message of rejection, especially since it has expressed several times its political doctrine based on the theory of the return of the Imamate, And worked to arrest… “Areas under its control are those who raise slogans celebrating the September 26 revolution, whether in person or on social media.”\nHowever, according to Al-Fateqi, there is a sector of Yemenis who believe that the importance at this stage must be to end the war, because it has taken a lot from Yemen at all political, economic and social levels and “it is time for the war to end, for the gunshots to stop.” And let the voice of peace grow louder.”\nInstead, Ahmed Naji, a researcher at the International Crisis Group, said in a statement to Al Jazeera Net, there has been a shift in the way Yemenis deal with the September 26 anniversary of the revolution in two parts:\nThe first is represented by the nostalgia of the past among many people, especially since the country is divided militarily and politically, and in a state of chaos and economic collapse, the revolution of September 26 is a moment of establishment for a large group of ideas of justice, equality, republic and change, which all these divisions A return to a state that refuses and the dire situation the country is facing. The second is that many people see the Houthis as coming to reject the idea of ​​a republican system, a kind of rejection of this trend and the revolution that has become iconic to many who reject Houthi rule. , and therefore the celebration of the revolution is accompanied by a very large attack on the group because it is contrary to this trend. Naji continued that areas that have witnessed clashes with the Houthis have witnessed very big celebrations and great momentum, such as in the governorates of Taiz and Marib, while in areas where there is no direct conflict with the Houthis, we have not witnessed them. According to the same speaker, this does not mean that they are supporters of the Houthis, but that this great involvement with the revolution of September 26 has stimulated.\nCelebration video #Taiz After the Yemeni revolution. #Yemen pic.twitter.com/W6SfxPaqo2\n— Maher Alabsi (@maheralabssi) September 26, 2024\nfind peace In this context, Dr. Abdul Qadir Al-Khali, professor of political analysis at Taiz University (one of Yemen’s largest universities), believes that this year has not seen revolution celebrations in areas controlled by the Houthi group. Because of group resistance in celebrating it, or because of economic and social conditions, many citizens are too busy searching for livelihood and securing their livelihood to celebrate this revolution.\nThe Yemeni academic added to Al Jazeera Net, “Many citizens are fed up with 10 years of division, and they see the need to come to a peaceful solution that leads to coexistence, removes all problems and dilemmas and restores the unity of Yemen. Geography and the Yemeni family.”\nHe continued, “Yemenis want a solution that will return their country to its normal path and unite Yemenis. This does not mean that they do not love the revolution or its principles, but they do not favor a return to the Imamate. The system or dividing Yemen which is Before Yemeni unity.”\nAl-Khali noted that “some Yemenis are beginning to fear for themselves that they will be subjected to repression, imprisonment or violations of their honor by political groups. They are turning towards peace and looking for a road map that leads to this direction. All members of society peaceful coexistence between.”\nCelebrating the September Revolution with this speed, this amount and this challenge, even from the areas occupied by the priests, despite the arrests, military crowds in the streets and squares, threats and intimidation, is the most popular referendum. Reject this group and so they must realize that there is no place for them in Yemen and they must leave. pic.twitter.com/sHS0uCma1R\n– Afashi and I have a history with Al-Iz (@FTarykh). September 25, 2024\nPreoccupation with livelihood Speaking to Al Jazeera Net, Hail Al-Ahmadi, a citizen living in Taiz Governorate, said that the wounds of war made him feel like seeking peace, indicating that he refrained from celebrating national revolutions as a result of their consumption. In the legitimate government and the political project of the Houthis, as he says.\nThe 50-year-old, who works as a daily wage earner and supports 10 people, added, “We long for peace and the establishment of a united Yemeni state where we can get the necessities of life for our families. We reject the parties to the conflict. All obstacles created by, and their efforts to undermine the gains of, the free revolutionaries and exploit their revolution politically.”\nIn his conversation with Al Jazeera Net, citizen Abdullah Al-Sabri believes that providing citizens with the basic necessities of life is the greatest national celebration for the majority of the population.\nAl-Sabri (60 years old) added, riding his motorcycle in the center of Taiz Thursday morning, dozens of meters from a large gathering celebrating the anniversary of the September 26 revolution, “The whole reality is the high price… We cannot provide the minimum necessities of life. … I don’t care about celebrating the Revolution, I’m neither for nor against it.”",

    "title": "Angleterre : Battu par West Ham, Arsenal laisse sa place de leader à Liverpool | RTL Info",
    "text": "Partager: Liverpool reste sur le trône de la Premier League après la contre-performance de son désormais dauphin, Arsenal, battu à l'Emirates Stadium par West Ham (2-0) jeudi en conclusion d’une 19e journée qui aura vu perdre trois des cinq équipes de tête. En plus des Gunners, Tottenham a été battu à Brighton (4-2) alors que le troisième Aston Villa avait cédé en fin de match mardi à Manchester United (3-2). Cinq jours après avoir accroché les Reds à Anfield Road (1-1), Arsenal a contre toute attente cédé face à l'équipe qui l'avait éliminée de la Coupe de la Ligue début novembre. Les Hammers ont donné raison à l'analyse de leur entraîneur David Moyes, qui assurait avant le match que cette année était la meilleure de l'histoire du club, avec notamment un triomphe en Ligue Europa Conférence. Ils n'ont pas concédé la moindre occasion dans la première demi-heure de jeu, et même marqué peu avant le quart d'heure après une mauvaise appréciation de Gabriel Magalhaes, qui a profité à Tomas Soucek (0-1, 13e). L'ancien défenseur Lillois a également perdu un duel aérien décisif en seconde période face à Konstantinos Mavropanos, suite à un corner de Ward-Prowse (2-0, 55e). Souvent efficaces face au but depuis le début de la saison, les Gunners ont cette fois manqué de réalisme avec Saka (30e, 42e), Martinelli (37e), Gabriel Jesus (66e) puis Trossard dans le dernier quart d'heure. Le score aurait pu être plus cruel si Benrahma avait transformé son penalty dans le temps additionnel. Les rentrées en jeu successives de Nketiah, Nelson et Smith Rowe ont rappelé le manque de profondeur de banc à disposition de Mikel Arteta. Arsenal compte deux points de retard sur Liverpool, alors que West Ham, 6e, est à l'affut des places européennes, à trois points de Tottenham et quatre points de Manchester City, vainqueur mardi à Everton (3-1) et qui compte un match de plus à disputer. - Tottenham rechute lourdement - Peu avant, Tottenham avait sévèrement rechuté sur le terrain de Brighton (4-2) et raté l'occasion de se rapprocher de la tête du championnat. Tottenham était pourtant la meilleure équipe à l'extérieur avant cette rencontre et finit la première moitié de saison sur une note négative, malgré une bonne cinquième place au classement, à un point de Manchester City. Meilleurs ces dernières semaines après un mois de novembre catastrophique sur le plan des résultats, les Spurs ont montré un visage inhabituel avec beaucoup de passivité, comme sur cette action individuelle de Joao Pedro qui a pu passer en revue quatre joueurs et donner une balle en or à Jack Hinshelwood, démarqué à l'entrée de la surface de réparation (1-0, 11e). Entre plusieurs occasions nettes pour Brighton (17e, 32e, 45e), le même Joao Pedro allait ensuite transformer deux pénalties (23e, 75e), avec entre-temps un frappe puissante de Pervis Estupinan dans la lucarne opposée de Vicario (63e). Alejo Veliz (81e) et Ben Davies (85e) ont réduit le score, trop tard pour faire douter les Seagulls. Brighton se repositionne à la huitième place, à six points de la première place européenne.",
