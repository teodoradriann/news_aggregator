( WHNS /Gray News) – A junkyard employee in North Carolina saved a cat from a car about to be crushed.\nAccording to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, an employee at the junkyard was removing the car’s battery “just moments” before it was sent to be crushed.\n“As he popped open the hood, a bundle of fur jumped out and took a blind leap of faith into his arms,” Brother Wolf Animal Rescue wrote in a Facebook post . “She looked at him with soft eyes, thanking him with slow blinks and soft purrs. It was almost like she knew that her life had been saved.”\nThe employee kept the cat bundled in his jacket for the rest of his shift before turning it over to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, where his girlfriend works.\nA man called the junkyard very soon after, searching frantically for his cat.\nHe described his cat, Lilly, as very adventurous, who loves riding in the car or on his motorcycle with him. She even has her own helmet.\nBrother Wolf Animal Rescue confirmed Lilly was the cat that the junkyard employee had rescued.\nThe shelter offered to return Lilly to her owner vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed at no cost. He gladly accepted the offer.\nLilly and her owner were reunited and very happy to see each other.\n“She melted into his arms as his eyes filled with tears of joy,” the shelter wrote in a Facebook post.\nCopyright 2024 WHNS via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "His Majesty King Charles III visited the UK Submarine Service at HM Naval Base Clyde on Thursday, meeting with Royal Navy submariners and their families to personally thank them for their service. According to the announcement, this visit marks His Majesty’s first to the base as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces, although he had previously visited the site in 2011 and 2013 as The Prince of Wales.\nDuring the visit, The King toured one of the Vanguard-class submarines, which are central to the UK’s Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD) programme, a mission that has been in operation for over 55 years. He was welcomed by First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Ben Key KCB CBE, and received the Royal Salute before being briefed on the submarine’s operations.\nCommodore Paul Dunn OBE, Commodore of the Submarine Service, said, “His Majesty’s visit, his first here as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces, acknowledges the valuable service of our submariners. The Royal Navy’s unbroken 55-year record of Continuous At Sea Deterrence is a tremendous source of pride, showcasing the skill, professionalism, and dedication of our defence enterprise.”\nThe King took time to meet with submariners and their families, acknowledging the sacrifices they make in service to the country. Chief Petty Officer (CPO) Longhurst, a submariner for 23 years, remarked on the significance of the event: “Meeting The King with my wife and shipmates today was a truly special moment, marking the culmination of my service as a Royal Navy submariner. His Majesty’s visit today not only highlights the importance of the job we do in keeping the nation safe, but it also emphasises the invaluable support of our loved ones.”\nAs part of the visit, His Majesty also met Gold Deterrent Pin holders, submariners recognised for their exceptional service time spent at sea as part of the CASD. The King concluded his visit by signing the visitors’ book in the Senior Rates’ Mess before departing.\nThe base is also preparing for the next generation of deterrent submarines, the Dreadnought-class, which will enter service in the early 2030s. Millions of pounds are being invested into HMNB Clyde to support their arrival, ensuring that the UK’s nuclear deterrence remains effective for decades to come.\nCommodore Sharon Malkin ADC, Naval Base Commander Clyde, said, “His Majesty’s visit to the Clyde today is a tremendous honour for all of us involved. This base has supported the UK’s Deterrent submarines since 1968, and today’s visit highlights the ongoing commitment of our submariners, civilian workers, and industry partners.”",

The KSE-100 started the session positive, hitting an intra-day high of 63,911.86. However, profit-taking kicked in and wiped out most of the gains. At close, the benchmark index settled at 63,282.23, up by 79.83 points or 0.13%. The market during the initial hours of the trading session saw somewhat of a buying spree as tensions between Iran and Pakistan simmered down, with the benchmark index hitting an intra-day high of 63,911.86 level, up nearly 710 points. Experts attributed the buying spree to easing cross-border tensions between Iran and Pakistan. “Moreover, prospects of settlement of circular debt” added to the positive sentiment, said Samiullah Tariq, Head of Research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Limited. As per reports, the interim minister has [prepared an innovative plan](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40284401/marg-bar-sarmachar-pakistans-strikes-inside-iran-kill-several-terrorists) to reduce the circular debt of energy sector, which has been shared with caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar. According to the main features, the plan will be restricted to public sector companies only, budget neutral and zero leakage. “Total settlement of Rs 1.268 trillion will be done.” [On Thursday](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40284406/stocks-plummet-at-psx-as-pakistan-iran-tensions-take-toll), escalating regional tension took its toll on investor sentiment at the bourse as the benchmark KSE-100 index sustained further losses to settle at 63,202.40, a decrease of 364.93 points or 0.57%. Pakistan said on Thursday that it undertook a series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes against what it called terrorist hideouts in Siestan-o-Baluchistan province of Iran, a little over a day after the neighbour also conducted missile strikes on Pakistani territory. “A number of terrorists were killed during the Intelligence-based operation – codenamed ‘Marg Bar Sarmachar’,” Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a press release issued on Thursday.

Estos dispositivos móviles también tienen precios accesibles y a continuación lo analizaremos detalladamente.\nXiaomi ha sabido meterse en el trono que, hasta hace poco, era dominado exclusivamente por Samsung y iPhone. Buena parte del éxito de la marca china se debe a lanzar al mercado equipos con prestaciones muy por encima de la media en todas sus gamas, pero con precios más que competitivos y atractivos para todos los bolsillos.\nPUEDES VER:\nHoy te presentamos el nuevo Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro, un teléfono de gran capacidad, el cual no solo resalta por su increíble capacidad de 512GB de memoria interna, sino también por su potente cámara de 200MP. ¿Qué otras características resaltan en este Xiaomi de bajo precio?

Podrás grabar videos en 4K a 30FPS.\nA diferencia de su hermano mayor, el Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G solo tiene certificación IP54, lo que significa que suporta salpicaduras pero NO es sumergible.
