    "text": "If you recently purchased a lottery ticket in Arizona, you may want to check your numbers now as one lucky winner matched enough numbers in Wednesday's (April 17) Powerball drawing to win a $1 million prize. The lucky Powerball ticket sold in the Grand Canyon State was the only one in the country that won anything during Wednesday night's drawing, scoring $1 million after matching five of the numbers called, according to the Powerball website . If you think you may have purchased the ticket, now's the time to check to see if you won. These are the lucky numbers that helped the to-be-determined winner score their huge prize: Numbers: 24 - 29 - 44 - 47 - 54 Powerball: 2 Power Play: 2x Because no tickets managed to match all six numbers during Wednesday's drawing, the jackpot has risen to an estimated $98 million ahead of the drawing on Saturday (April 20). Once the prize is claimed, the winner will join the list of other lucky players who have scored incredible, life-changing sums thanks to a lottery ticket and will be able to use their prize to fulfill the wildest dreams, from taking a long-awaited vacation to buying a new house.",

    "text": "Latest Videos\n[Mark Zuckerberg](https://knewz.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-builds-secret-lavish-apocalypse-proof-hideaway-to-survive-doomsday/)'s decision to change content moderation on [Facebook](https://knewz.com/tag/facebook/), Instagram, and Threads could reflect his need for [political](https://knewz.com/category/politics/) allies.\nWith growing political pressure on tech firms, savvy Zuckerberg is adjusting his approach to maintain influence and avoid further scrutiny as [Donald Trump](https://knewz.com/tag/donald-trump/) takes office – especially as Meta faces potential changes to laws protecting [social media](https://knewz.com/social-media-america-democracy/) companies, [Knewz.com](https://knewz.com/) can reveal.\nEarlier this week, Zuckerberg shared his decision to end \"fact-checking\" on Meta – marking his shift from banning Trump to fully supporting the president-elect.\nThe tech entrepreneur admitted while [Meta](https://knewz.com/isis-inspired-new-orleans-terrorist-suspect-used-meta-smart-glasses-to-plan-new-years-day-attack/?utm_source=rss_google) and Facebook had previously censored conservative views on a large scale, free speech will now be restored on both platforms.\nIn a five-minute video, he promised to return to the company's roots by reducing errors, simplifying policies, and enhancing free expression.\nHe said: \"We're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms.\n\"More specifically, we're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the US.\"\nZuckerberg received criticism in the comments of the announcement, with one writing: \"New era of [misinformation](https://knewz.com/tag/fake-news/).\"\nA second wrote: \"So attacking [minorities](https://knewz.com/knewz-exclusive-advocates-plead-to-end-organ-harvesting-disappearances-of-minorities-in-china/), encouraging their aggression, risking their lives as consequences, will be considered for you free expression? Oohhh I forgot, hate speech generates more engagement and that generates more money.\"\nAnother slammed: \"Hey man, I noticed all the hate you're getting and I just wanted to say that you deserve it.\"\nSimilar to X, which was taken over by [Tesla](https://knewz.com/tag/Tesla/) tycoon [Elon Musk](https://knewz.com/tag/elon-musk/) in 2023, Meta's shift will allow users to flag potentially misleading posts for more context – in a move that seems part of a broader effort to reshape the internet for a second Trump era.\nZuckerberg threatened governments in [Europe](https://knewz.com/tag/Europe/), South America, and [China](https://knewz.com/tag/china/), stating Meta would work with Trump to resist foreign pressures to censor American companies.\nMaking his platforms more Trump-friendly, Meta is also planning to move its trust and safety teams from liberal [California](https://knewz.com/tag/california/) to conservative Texas.\nThe switch aims to build trust in regions less concerned with team bias.\nThese changes come as Zuckerberg has been working to mend ties with Trump, donating $1 million to his inauguration fund and recently meeting him at the Republican's Mar-a-Lago resort.\nAdditionally, Zuckerberg added Dana White to Meta's board, representing a notable shift in his stance on social media.\nMeta will also \"simplify\" its policies to remove restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are seen as out of step with mainstream discourse.\nThe changes will impact Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, with Trump long criticizing Meta for politically biased censorship against conservatives.\nHe previously supported repealing Section 230, which protects social media companies from lawsuits over user content. After the [January 6](https://knewz.com/tag/january-6/) insurrection, Trump was suspended from Facebook for two years but was reinstated in 2023 after announcing his third presidential run.\nBy July 2024, Meta lifted all penalties from his accounts, citing the public's need to hear from presidential candidates.",
