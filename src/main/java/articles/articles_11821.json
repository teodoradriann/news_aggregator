    "text": "Mark Carney would be ‘outstanding’ addition to federal politics, Trudeau says\nPosted July 11, 2024 5:19 pm.\nLast Updated July 11, 2024 5:26 pm.\nOTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney would be an “outstanding addition” to federal politics, and that he has been trying to recruit him to join the political fray for years.\nTrudeau was asked about the possibility of replacing Chrystia Freeland by making Carney his new finance minister during a press conference at the NATO summit in Washington.\nRather than deny the possibility, Trudeau is praising Carney and says Canadians need good people to step up in politics right now\nBut he also says he has full confidence in Freeland, and calls her a close friend, ally and partner.\nA source in the Prime Minister’s Office, who was not authorized to speak publicly, says the suggestion that Trudeau is thinking about replacing Freeland with Carney is “totally false.”\nThe idea of Carney running for the Liberals has been a constant discussion in Canadian political circles for years and he himself has not ruled out the possibility of one day seeking the Liberal leadership.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 11, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "Met Éireann has issued three weather warnings for much of the country as the island prepares for strong winds and heavy rainfall up until New Year's Day. A status yellow rainfall warning has been issued for Donegal, Leitrim, North Mayo and Sligo. The warning, which came into effect at 6am on Friday, will remain in place until 9pm on Friday night, with \"localised flooding\" expected as a result of heavy rainfall. The forecaster has issued a status yellow wind and rain warning for Cork, Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Mayo and Wexford, with \"strong and gusty\" winds expected over the coming days. The warning, which will come into effect at 2am on Saturday and remain in place until 11pm on Saturday night, poses the risk of flooding along coastal areas. Other potential impacts include surface flooding and wave overtopping, followed by loose debris on roads and difficult travelling conditions, while the warning is in place. The forecaster has also issued an additional weather warning for those in Cork, Kerry, Clare and Limerick. The status yellow wind warning will begin from 11pm on Saturday night and remain in place until 5pm on Sunday. The forecaster warns of strong winds which may affect travelling conditions over this period. The warnings follow severe weather conditions over the past few days, resulting in major power outages and spot flooding across the country. A taxi driver in Waterford City was hospitalised on Wednesday night after his car was hit by a falling tree during high winds. It happened in the Newtown area at around 11pm, and the driver was treated for minor injuries. Saturday's weather forecast promises a wet and windy day, with threatening thunderstorms and hail as the day progresses. \"Fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest,\" the forecaster said. New Year's Day is expected to bring a mix of sunshine and scattered showers, with much milder temperatures than previous days. Highest temperatures of between 5C and 8C can be predicted over the course of the day. 2024 is expected to start on a wet note, with outbreaks of rain and scattered showers travelling across the country from the west.",

    "text": "MANSFIELD: “In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” – Matthew 5:16 Many people look forward to Christmas morning for a variety of different reasons. The excitement of the unknown is all part of the fun! If we aren’t intentional, it would be very easy to miss the hidden ‘special’ lingering in the moments the Lord quietly stores away for us. December 25, 2023, was no different. Becky was able to ‘Rejoice and be glad, for her reward in heaven was great!’ As a brilliant sun opened up the sky, the unusually warm December day took the sting away as we quietly watched her pass away from this life into heaven’s home. She fought a truly brave, courageous and joyful fight against cancer. She absolutely WON and is completely healed and more alive and well than even the best here. Becky was born in Mansfield, Ohio on March 22, 1947 where she lived most of her life. She graduated from Ontario High School in 1965 and went on to marry the love of her life, David on September 21, 1968. She enjoyed a career at Mansfield Christian School serving others well as a part time aide. Becky was truly a woman who loved well, lived simply and prayed fervently. Things were just things. Money wasn’t meant to be spent lavishly. If she ever bought something for herself, it was a true rarity. You would not typically find her in a crowded room, or a table full of people. But when you found her, and took the space and time for her, her smile was joy and her presence was enough. She loved animals and always wanted to own a baby monkey. She loved flowers and was wonderful at planting. When Becky was diagnosed with cancer, she never complained or said “Why me?’ She just smiled and asked, “What do we need to do?” She walked this journey in faith and valor. Her husband David, loving her and caring for her every step of the way. As Corrie Ten Boom once said: “Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God.” She always trusted the sovereign Lord. From the hospital bed, from the floor after falling, from the sickness, from not being able to walk, from being told ‘there is nothing more that we can do…’ Through a smile of faith and a sense of humor she kept her eyes on Jesus. She wanted people to see JESUS, not her cancer. Becky is survived by David Mackey, her loving husband of 55 years; Son, Brian (Chris) Mackey; Daughter, Kimberly (Matthew) Snyder. Grandchildren, Izaiah, Grady, Shelby, Tait, Zoe, Micah, Molly, Landon, Joey, Aubrey, Xavier, Jacob, Jailynn and Jaiden. Her best friend Dana Palmer and special friends Mark and Mary Winkler. She was preceded in death by her son Bret, and grandson Lazarus. The family would like to give a very special Thank You to Bob Ball and Kaye Hahn for standing so closely by us during this time. To Brandon Howard and his construction team for working so very hard on the house they called HOME. May we all remember to live and love like Jesus no matter what we face in this life. Give people their flowers while they are still alive. And you can do ALL things through Christ who gives you strength. A memorial service celebrating the life of Becky Mackey will be held Friday, January 5, 2023 at 11 am in Mansfield Alliance Church, 291 Cook Road, Mansfield, Ohio 44906 where her family will receive friends the hour prior, from 10 am – 11 am. Pastor Dale Patrick and Becky’s son, Chaplain Brian Mackey will officiate. Private burial will be held in Mansfield Memorial Park. The Lexington Avenue Snyder Funeral Homes is honored to assist the Mackey family with Becky’s services.

    "text": "[Health & Fitness](/california/hollywood/lifestyle)\nDozens Sickened After Eating Raw Oysters At LA Times Food Event: Reports\nMore than 80 people fell ill after eating raw oysters at an event celebrating the most delicious restaurants in Los Angeles.\nHOLLYWOOD, CA — Dozens of people who attended a Los Angeles Times restaurant event earlier this month became sick, apparently after eating raw oysters that have since been recalled due to potential norovirus contamination, according to reports.\nMore than 80 people who attended the Times' 101 Best Restaurants event at the Hollywood Palladium on Dec. 3 reported getting sick with symptoms including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting, the LA Times reported.\nPublic health officials say the illnesses appear to be linked to raw oysters served at the event, which celebrated the unveiling of the Times' annual list of the region's top restaurants.\nFind out what's happening in Hollywoodfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThe state Department of Public Health on Dec. 13 warned consumers not to eat raw oysters harvested from certain areas of British Columbia. The FDA has since reiterated that warning and the company that supplied the oysters issued a recall.\nThe oysters at the Times event were supplied by Fanny Bay Oysters, [LA Taco reported](https://lataco.com/la-times-101-restaurants-illness-oysters), which is among the oyster brands health officials say may be contaminated with norovirus.\nFind out what's happening in Hollywoodfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThe oysters were sourced from Santa Monica Seafood and provided to one of the restaurants featured at the event, the Times reported.\n“We have produced culinary events for many years and take food safety very seriously,” Times spokesperson Hillary Manning said. “As is the case with each of our events, we had protocols in place and, based on an inspection from the L.A. County Department of Public Health, we were in compliance with all relevant safety standards. We also know the care that each chef and restaurant takes in preparing and serving food to our community.”\nImpacted oysters include those harvested in British Columbia in late November and early December. They may be marketed as Fanny Bay, Buckley Bay or Royal Miyagi Oysters.\nNorovirus, often called food poisoning or the stomach flu, is a contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. It spreads easily from person to person and from contaminated food and surfaces. Hand sanitizer is usually ineffective in killing the virus, according to the California Department of Public Health.\nNorovirus can contaminate food that's grown or washed in contaminated water or if it's prepared by someone who is infected with the virus, state health officials said. It's the No. 1 cause of foodborne illness in the U.S., according to the CDC.\nAdditionally, it spreads very easily from person to person — through direct contact between two people — and can survive for weeks on surfaces and objects, according to health officials.\nState health officials offered these tips to avoid the spread of norovirus:\n- Practice good hand washing techniques using soap and water — hand sanitizers are usually not effective against norovirus.\n- Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables.\n- Cook shellfish thoroughly.\n- If you're sick, stay home: Isolate for at least two days after you feel better.\n- Do not prepare food or care for others when you're sick with norovirus or have diarrhea.\n- Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces or objects with a bleach solution in order to kill norovirus\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.\n[Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.](/california/hollywood/subscribe)",
