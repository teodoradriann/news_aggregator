    "text": "Macron says France has ‘no limits’ to its support for Ukraine\nPresident Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said France would not rule out any option to support Ukraine two years into Russia’s invasion, leaders of several major French political parties said.\nSpeaking after the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, the party chiefs said the talks with Macron left them concerned, with some accusing him of using the conflict to boost his coalition’s standing ahead of crucial European elections this summer.\nThe president had last week stunned many in Europe by refusing to rule out the dispatch of Western ground troops to Ukraine, pointing to Russia’s hardening stance.\nAnd earlier this week Macron urged Ukraine’s allies not to be “cowards” in supporting the ex-Soviet country to fight off the Russian invasion.\nSome party leaders on Thursday said Macron advocated a “no limits” approach to counter Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nGreen party leader Marine Tondelier recounted Macron saying Putin “obviously has no limits.”\nShe said it was “extremely worrying” to see Macron tell the meeting “we must show we have no limits,” too.\nJordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally (RN) party, said he had pleaded with Macron “not to go to war with Russia.”\nThe president’s thinking includes “no limits and no red lines”, said Bardella.\nFar-left heavyweight Manuel Bompard added: “I arrived worried and I left even more worried.”\nWeighing in from Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Macron “continues to raise the level of France’s direct involvement” in the Ukraine war.\n‘Total solidarity’ France’s parliament will have a chance to vote on the country’s Ukraine strategy, including a bilateral security treaty signed with Kyiv last month.\nDebates and non-binding votes will take place next Tuesday in the National Assembly lower house and in the Senate upper house on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, Macron also met with Moldovan President Maia Sandu, pledging France’s “unwavering support” for her ex-Soviet country as tensions mount between Chisinau and pro-Russian separatists.\nDuring the meeting the two signed a bilateral defence deal, as well as an “economic roadmap”, although no details were provided.\nLater Thursday, France was also set to host a video conference of nearly 30 countries including Ukraine, which will follow up on the initiatives discussed at an international Ukraine summit hosted by Macron last week.\nAhead of Thursday’s meeting with the opposition, Macron had spoken to his predecessors Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace late Wednesday.\nSpeaking to journalists after the talks, Hollande called for more aid for Ukraine as well as European unity.\n“The only possible response is to show that we are with the Ukrainians in total solidarity, that we are giving them all the support they need, without taking part in any combat ourselves,” Hollande said.\nAsked about the possibility of sending troops, the Socialist former president said: “My position on military issues is: the less we say, the better.”\nElection battle On Wednesday, government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot said that it was “quite obvious” that the RN was not aligned with Macron’s call to do everything to ensure Russia’s defeat.\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal has accused the RN of “supporting Russia more than Ukraine”.\nThe RN is the largest opposition party in France’s lower house of parliament and leads Macron’s alliance by a wide margin in European election polls ahead of the June 9 vote.\nMost of Macron’s European allies have said they would not send troops to Ukraine, while French officials have insisted any such forces could be sent to back operations such as de-mining rather than fighting Russian forces.\nIn an apparent response to Macron, Putin has warned of a “real” risk of nuclear war and said “that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory.”\n(AFP)",

    "text": "As America’s largest department store, Macy’s has enormous influence over the retail sector at large—and as one of the industry’s biggest sellers of home products, what happens at the company will surely impact the home furnishings world in particular. Now, with a corporate raider trying to take over, a new CEO on the way in, and another round of layoffs and store closings just announced, the legacy retailer finds itself very much at a crossroads. However the attempted takeover battle turns out—more on that in a minute—one thing is certain: The executive leading the defense will be Tony Spring, set to take over as CEO on February 1 from current president Jeff Gennette, who is retiring after seven years at the helm. Spring, who has been running the company’s upmarket Bloomingdale’s banner for the past 10 years, is a company lifer who previously led its home division. Gennette’s scorecard is a mixed one. While he kept the giant company in the black and navigated the worst of the pandemic when its stores were closed, he largely failed in a proposed reinvention of the department store model. On his watch, the company has continued to lose market share across the retail spectrum to off-pricers, discounters and online sellers. Meanwhile, Spring generally received high marks for his leadership at Bloomingdale’s—granted, a much smaller niche player than Macy’s. Like his predecessor and mentor Mike Gould, he walked the tightrope between merchandising excitement and profitability, largely beating upscale competitors like Saks, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. He will need all of that acumen as he takes on his new job. On January 21, just days before the changeover, the company announced it was closing five stores and laying off about 2,350 people—3.5 percent of its workforce. The announcement came under Gennette’s watch so as not to taint Spring’s start, a pretty common practice for big public companies. Still, it could serve as a harbinger of what’s to come. With 500 Macy’s-branded stores, 158 Blue Mercury locations, 34 Bloomingdale’s outposts, and about 30 off-price stores under the Macy’s Backstage and Bloomingdale’s Outlet banners, the company operates a large fleet. As secondary and marginal malls continue to deteriorate in shopper relevance, and older locations face tough corporate decisions on whether to reinvest in them, it’s likely the company will continue to trim its number of stores. By how much—and what it means for potential workforce reductions—is the question, but given the modest store-closing pace under Gennette, it’s unlikely we’ll see any dramatic increase in downsizing. The wild card is the potential takeover battle. Two private equity investors, Arkhouse and Brigade Capital Management, made an unsolicited offer in December to buy Macy’s for $5.8 billion, which at the time represented a 32 percent premium over its stock price. The stock has since retreated from just under $21 a share to a little more than $18. Its market cap is down to just under $5 billion, which suggests Wall Street investors don’t believe a deal will come through. That became clearer earlier this week, when Macy’s rejected the offer and in fact said it wanted nothing to do with the two potential suitors, declaring it wouldn’t release any additional financial information to them. Needless to say, Arkhouse and Brigade didn’t take this kindly and said they would continue to pursue a buyout, perhaps taking it straight to shareholders and bypassing the board. The company said it doubted the two investors had enough funding to do the deal, particularly since the majority was coming from debt that would be layered onto Macy’s. This is a tactic we’ve seen many times in retail history—Toys R Us, Sears, JCPenney and Neiman Marcus, to name a few recent examples—and it has largely failed, with each of those retailers eventually filing for bankruptcy and some going out of business completely. Macy’s itself, in a former configuration, filed for bankruptcy in 1992 when a real estate investor bought it with debt and couldn’t keep it going. Retail businesses, for better or worse, generally don’t generate enough cash to pay down the massive debt levels needed in these kinds of takeover deals. Arkhouse and Brigade may not be ready to back down and could up their offer. They could also attract other potential buyers, who might have different funding plans that Macy’s shareholders might find more attractive. The company’s stock is down 28 percent over the past five years, although it’s worth noting that competitors like Nordstrom and Kohl’s have done much worse, each off more than 60 percent during the same period. Regardless of what happens with all these moving parts, 2024 promises to be a critical year for Macy’s. Getting its spring fashion assortment right and keeping its stores fresh will be nothing compared to the challenges presented by a potential takeover, change in leadership and downsizing. The biggest department store in the world could be in for the biggest fight of its 166-year life.",

This is again a cooperative game that involves active interaction between players, like the studio’s previous project, It Takes Two. But the rating of the new game is more adult.\nIMDA, which ranks games in Singapore, has given Split Fiction a 16+ rating. It Takes Two was rated General (suitable for all ages). The 16+ rating means that Split Fiction may contain blood, strong language and mild violence.\nThe main characters of the game Split Fiction will be two young writers – Mio and Zoe. One of them was creating fantasy, the other worked in the science fiction genre. As a result, they find themselves in the worlds of their own “mixed” stories, where they must undergo various challenges, fight enemies and solve puzzles.\nSplit Fiction is being developed on Unreal Engine 5; the game’s Steam page does not list a Russian localization.",

    "text": "Bethlehem, Occupied West Bank: Palestinian Christians held a sombre Christmas vigil in Bethlehem on Saturday, with candle-lit hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual festive celebrations at the spot where they believe Jesus Christ was born.\nMost years Bethlehem basks in the central place it holds in the Christian story of Jesus' life, born there in a stable because there was no room for his parents at the inn, and placed in an animal's manger, the humblest of all possible beds.\nSome 2,000 years later, pilgrims usually flock to the reputed location of that stable in Bethlehem's Byzantine-era Church of the Nativity, where most Christmases there are joyful displays of lights and trees in Manger Square.\nBut with Israel's campaign in Gaza having killed more than 20,000 people according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave, the mostly Palestinian population of Bethlehem in the Occupied West Bank are in mourning too.\nThis year they decided to have no large tree, the usual centrepiece of Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations because of the carnage taking place only 50km (30 miles) away.\nAnd in place of the usual nativity scene, as Christians call the traditional display of figurines representing the holy family, Bethlehem churches this year placed the models amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\"Bethlehem is a message. It is not a city, it is a message of peace to the whole world. From this sacred place we convey a message of peace ... stop the war, stop the blood, the killing and the revenge,\" said Father Ibrahim Faltas, a friar at the vigil.\nChristians make up around 2% of the population across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian territories, according to Protecting Holy Land Christians, a campaign organised by the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, with a smaller proportion in Gaza.\nMeanwhile, the war, triggered by a Hamas attack on Israeli towns on Oct. 7 that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, has kept away the majority of expected foreign tourists hoping to celebrate Christmas in Bethlehem.\nWhen church leaders convened at Bethlehem in early December to mark the start of Advent, as Christians call the weeks before Christmas, there were few people in the usually crowded streets and squares to watch the pared-down display.\n\"This Christmas comes to Bethlehem in a different shape. Nowadays Bethlehem, as any other Palestinian city, is in mourning. We feel sad,\" said the town mayor Hanna Hanania, lighting a candle in Manger Square.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 24 December 2023, 00:22 IST)",

Es un niño, un ser indefenso e inocente y, para colmo, dentro de una iglesia\", expresó la alcaldesa de Manta en su cuenta de X (antes Twitter).\nAnte este nuevo hecho violento, la alcaldesa hizo un llamado al Gobierno central: \"Ya no pedimos, exigimos seguridad. Se trata de lo más elemental: cuidar la vida de la gente\".\nValdivieso añadió que \"no se puede postergar la militarización del país\" y dijo que esta medida \"es indispensable\" para enfrentar la inseguridad.\nEl doble crimen ocurrió en la iglesia María Auxiliadora, de la parroquia Los Esteros, pocos minutos después de que arrancara una ceremonia religiosa en el lugar.\nSicarios irrumpieron en la iglesia y realizaron múltiples disparos contra un hombre, quien falleció en el lugar. Además, las balas alcanzaron a un niño de 11 años, quien fue trasladado a una casa de salud, en donde falleció.\nOla de violencia\nManta es una de las ciudades de Ecuador que enfrenta una ola criminal, por lo que el pasado 24 de noviembre, la alcaldesa ya\nconvocó de forma urgente a una reunión para tratar temas de seguridad.\nEn esa ocasión, ya hizo un llamado al presidente Daniel Noboa, para que \"apoye\" en la lucha contra la violencia criminal que mantiene en alerta a la ciudad.\nOtro cantón de Manabí que atraviesa una ola de violencia es Sucre, en donde las muertes violentas se han triplicado en 2023 en comparación con el año pasado y llegan a 70.\nEl Consejo de Seguridad Ciudadana decidió suspender las actividades de Fin de Año y solicitó presencia policial y militar, sobre todo en la cabecera cantonal, Bahía de Caráquez.\nContenido Patrocinado\nCultura empresarial contra la violencia de género\nContenido Patrocinado\nDelicias compartidas: La magia de reunirse alrededor de una pizza\nContenido Patrocinado\nCuida tus ojos con estos consejos prácticos\nContenido Patrocinado\nRegalos que nos harán sentir como niños en Navidad\nContenido Patrocinado\n¡Comienza el año cumpliendo sueños! ¿Qué harías con $100.000?\nContenido Patrocinado\nCoonecta Red Transaccional: 17 años de inclusión financiera\nContenido Patrocinado\nLa guía definitiva para realizar compras navideñas sin estrés\nContenido Patrocinado\nPiensa en tu familia: no utilices explosivos en las fiestas\nContenido Patrocinado\nCuando conduces un ícono, eliges ser uno\nContenido Patrocinado\nCostillas de cerdo: Una receta diferente para Navidad\nContenido Patrocinado\nOMODA duplica su presencia global de SUVs\nContenido Patrocinado\nDescubre un truco para ahorrar\nContenido Patrocinado\nVinos y viajes: Regalos inolvidables por Navidad\nContenido Patrocinado\nGrünenthal: 50 años innovando por mundo sin dolor\nContenido Patrocinado\nBisbal: 20 años de música e imagen navideña de Diners Club\nContenido Patrocinado\nMetro de Quito: símbolo de unidad nacional\nContenido Patrocinado\nTecnología que llega a cada rincón del país",

Los fuertes vientos y las lluvias han arrancado varios tendidos eléctricos en Escocia y han dejado alrededor de 14.000 hogares sin electricidad. Casas dañadas, trenes cancelados y vuelos afectados se han convertido en las imágenes más destacadas de este fenómeno meteorológico que ha sacudido al país.\nEn algunas zonas costeras de Escocia se han enfrentado a rachas de viento de 128 kilómetros por hora. Un hecho al que han tenido que hacer frente los trabajadores para restablecer el suministro eléctrico que se cortó por las ramas caídas y otros escombros, según ‘ABC News’.\nMÁS Muere una mujer de forma fulminante al ser alcanzada por un rayo en una playa de Colombia Al menos 15 muertos por un temporal con fuertes rachas de viento y lluvias en la provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina ¿Qué pasa si me cancelan el vuelo por mal tiempo? Un breve tornado localizado ocurrió en el noroeste de Inglaterra El meteorólogo del Reino Unido, la Met Office, informó que una “tormenta supercelular”, con una “fuerte corriente ascendente giratoria”, cruzó el área del Gran Manchester el miércoles por la noche, junto a un breve tornado localizado. Alrededor de 100 propiedades acabaron dañadas. Tal y como ha explicado la Agencia de Medio Ambiente, es probable que se produzcan inundaciones locales en los ríos de partes de West Midlands, Yorkshire y Humber hasta el lunes.\nEl servicio de trenes de Escocia estuvo afectado y se vieron obligados a suspender los viajes en algunas líneas hasta que los funcionarios pudiesen realizar una inspección completa. El aeropuerto de Heathrow, el principal centro de viajes del Reino Unido, canceló 18 vuelos el miércoles debido a las restricciones de control del tráfico aéreo en rutas nacionales y muchos otros han tenido que hacer aterrizajes peligrosos por las fuertes rachas de viento.\nSíguenos en nuestro canal de WhatsApp y conoce toda la actualidad al momento.\nTemas Actualidad Sucesos Tormentas Reino Unido",
