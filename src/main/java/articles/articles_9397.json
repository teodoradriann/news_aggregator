    "title": "Leap day babies in Tampa celebrate unique and unusual birthday in 2024",
    "text": "It’s only here once every four years, which gave leap day kids an extra reason to celebrate on Thursday. Though some will tell you a February 29th birthday isn’t without its quirks. If you played the “guess my age” game with Frank Bastone, you’d likely lose. “32, or 8 in leap years,” said Bastone. Born February 29th, 1992, Bastone’s birthday only shows up on the calendar every four years. He said he often gets asked when he celebrates his birthday on off years. The answer: February 28th, not March 1st. “As my parents stated early on, you were born on the last day of February, not the first day of March,” he said. The birthday has come with some comical conflicts over the years. “When I turned 18, I tried to buy an M-rated video game, and they wouldn’t sell it to me on the 28th because the 29th hadn’t technically happened yet,” said Bastone. “And then when I turned 21, I tried to order a drink from the local bar, and they wouldn’t serve it to me on the 28th because the 29th hadn’t technically happened yet.” The odds are against you: there’s just a one in 1,461 chance of being born on a leap day. Still, Bastone is in good company. “8 pounds, five ounces, 20 and a half inches long,” said Tasha Ward. Over at Tampa General Hospital, families welcomed newborns into the world this leap day too, like Ward’s daughter, Olivia Joan. “I was supposed to be due on March 10th, but I have diabetes so they induced me today, and I came to the hospital at 5:30 this morning. She was here by 8:19 a.m.,” said Ward. Baby Olivia rested easy on day one, and for mom, it was a cool coincidence, feeling lucky and filled with joy. “It’s a leap year,” said Ward. “It happens every four years, so I think it was pretty cool.” The next leap year will be in 2028.",

    "title": "Add Cozy Charm To Your Home With The Neutral Paint Shade Erin Napier Swears By",
    "text": "Erin Napier knows a thing or two about paint colors, having transformed plenty of houses alongside her husband Ben on HGTV's \"Home Town.\" She has incorporated heaps of neutrals into homes over the show's duration, but there's one neutral Napier particularly likes: Valspar's \" Brown Buzz .\" The design expert used this color in Season 1 of \"Home Town\" for a family dining space to create a specific ambiance.\nPer Homes & Gardens , Napier explained why she picked the paint hue. \"The dining room needed to be a nondescript and aged color that reminded me of the wall colors I'd seen in old French country homes,\" she stated. A warm, slightly smoky neutral with hints of gray, \"Brown Buzz\" is ideal for giving a room a cozy feel. Available at Lowe's , it's priced at just under $60 for a gallon of paint and features a scuff, stain, and scratch-resistant satin base. If you're looking for tips on incorporating this color into your home, look no further. We've got all the ideas you need.\nTurn your bedroom into a soothing oasis with Erin Napier's paint pick\nbridgewaydesigns/Instagram\nDue to its calming vibe, \"Brown Buzz\" would be an excellent option for a bedroom. To bring out the tint of green, we recommend using it for the wall your bed sits against and then opting for green bedding or a green throw. You don't have to go all out with the green — a few touches here and there, like a cushion, would also have a similar effect. As Erin Napier mentioned, she chose to use \"Brown Buzz\" in a client's dining room because she was trying to recreate the style of French country decor .\nGenerally, this style includes soft, earthy colors with small pops of color like mustard and muted reds, so choosing shades that fit with this style are a perfect choice if you also want to evoke a traditional feel in your space. Despite being a neutral in the green family, \"Brown Buzz\" is a warm paint color — so it will look at odds with super bright white or gray. If you prefer a wholly neutral room, cream or warm off-white are complementary warm neutrals.\nBring a welcoming ambiance into your living room\nImaginima/Getty Images\nAs well as in a bedroom, \"Brown Buzz\" is a great choice for use in a smaller living room. Often, people think you should only stick to light colors in dark rooms, and sometimes this is the case. However, soft-toned darker neutrals like \"Brown Buzz\" are the exception to this rule. Warm neutral paint shades will bring character and depth to a space without making it appear closed-in. Cream, beige, and warm-toned taupe are all good complementary colors if you want to stick to a neutral theme.\nFor a living room that evokes French country chic, opt for a mustard yellow sofa propped against a wall painted in \"Brown Buzz\" or something less permanent like a throw or plant pot if you like to change things up often. Finally, take inspiration from Napier and use the hue in your dining room to create a more traditional vibe. If your dining room gets lots of natural light, it can be used all over. However, if it doesn't, it's best to use it on only one wall to avoid a dark and narrow look.",
