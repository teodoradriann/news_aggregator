    "text": "A banking delegation headed by Chairman of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, Taleh Kazimov, has recently completed its historic visit to the US. This landmark trip, organized jointly by the Azerbaijan Banks Association (ABA) and the US-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce, marked the first comprehensive visit of Azerbaijani bankers to the US and ushered in a new era in bilateral financial cooperation. The delegation included the heads of 11 leading commercial banks of Azerbaijan, who interacted fruitfully for four days with representatives of the US government, heads of financial organizations and leading experts in the field of finance. Expansion of economic ties During meetings at the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Commercial Service, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other key US departments, the delegation discussed strengthening economic ties between the two countries. The parties noted the importance of the role of the banking sector in stimulating trade relations and investment, and also agreed on joint efforts to expand cooperation between financial sector regulatory authorities and banks of the two countries. Exchange of experience and best practices In addition to discussing issues of bilateral cooperation, Azerbaijani bankers received a valuable opportunity to familiarize themselves with the best practices of their American colleagues. Meetings with representatives of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Bank of Mellon New York and other leading US financial institutions allowed them to learn best practices in information security, cybersecurity, risk management, compliance and the use of artificial intelligence in banking operations. Prospects for cooperation The visit of a delegation of Azerbaijani banks to the US became a catalyst for new promising areas of cooperation. The parties agreed to expand cooperation in areas such as: Trade finance: Helping Azerbaijani companies access financing to export goods and services to the US. Investment cooperation: Supporting the participation of American investors in projects in Azerbaijan. Expanding correspondent banking: Strengthening ties between Azerbaijani and US banks to facilitate cross-border payments. After the visit, some Azerbaijani banks have already announced the opening of a correspondent account with the Bank of Mellon New York, which in turn should serve to expand business in the field of international payments, as well as promote international money transfer services. So, the visit of the Azerbaijani banking delegation to the US became a significant event, opening a new page in relations between the financial sectors of the two countries. The agreements reached lay a solid foundation for long-term and mutually beneficial cooperation between the financial sector of Azerbaijan and the US.",

    "text": "[Celebrity](/celebrity/)\n“Song Mino Unable to Perform Normal Activities, CCTV Preserved”: How Did He Manage a Hawaii Trip and “New Journey to the West”?\nWINNER’s Song Mino has found himself at the center of controversy as explanations regarding allegations of negligence during his alternative service have only fueled the debate\nOn December 19, A, the person in charge of the Mapo Resident Convenience Facility, where [Song Mino](/tag/song-mino/) is serving as a public service worker, commented on his health condition, “He’s unable to carry out normal activities. His body is heavily subdued, almost as if under the influence of medication, and there are cycles where his symptoms worsen. March and April were difficult, and October through December were particularly bad.”\nSong Mino had previously spoken openly about his struggles with panic disorder and bipolar disorder. As a result, he was classified as a Grade 4 reservist and assigned to alternative service as a public service worker.\nHowever, despite A’s explanation, public backlash has intensified. Reports revealed that Song Mino took a six-day trip to Hawaii in October, which directly conflicts with A’s claim that his condition significantly worsened during that month due to mental health issues.\nFurther skepticism has arisen from Song Mino’s prior activities. Before enlistment, he actively pursued his music career with album releases and concerts, and also participated in entertainment programs like “New Journey to the West”. Critics argue that if his condition deteriorates during March~April and October~December as claimed, it would have been impossible for him to film “New Journey to the West” or “Peak Time” during those overlapping periods.\nAdding to the controversy, rumors of a two-year romantic relationship with actress Park Ju-hyun, reportedly starting in 2022, have further complicated the situation.\nAccordingly, both the [Military Manpower Administration and the police have launched investigations](/dispatch-accuses-song-mino-winner-of-neglecting-duties-during-military-service-receiving-special-treatment-from-superiors/). A confirmed that the Military Manpower Administration had visited the site to review related materials such as CCTV footage and attendance records. Police also requested that the CCTV footage be preserved. Additionally, Song Mino has been instructed to submit documentation addressing allegations of negligence and falsification of attendance records.\nCurrently on medical leave, Song Mino is scheduled to be discharged from service on December 23.",

    "text": "President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region. In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana. Mr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country. He argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations. “We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. “This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.” Venezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores. The region has been under Guyana’s control for decades. But in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. As tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means. During the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country. On Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled. “Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital. HMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones. The ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces. The nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.

    "text": "This alibi should not even be considered, even if it seems obvious. Not with him, not with Xabi Alonso. “I’m not worried. I’m not crying and I’m not a victim,” said the Spanish coach of Bayer Leverkusen, the most impressive and stable team in the Bundesliga this year. That should be the case again in 2024, explained the man who was world and European champion as a player and is now considered the new star in the international coaching sky: “We also have such a competitive team.” That’s the case – that means for Leverkusen: in the coming weeks they will be without five players, including three important regulars. Alonso will possibly be missing his two central defenders Odilon Kossounou (Ivory Coast) and Edmond Tapsoba (Burkina Faso), his goalscorer Victor Boniface (Nigeria) and his offensive alternatives Amine Adli (Morocco) and Nathan Tella (Nigeria) until February 13th. This is a significant weakening. The Africa Cup is calling. By the end of December, the 24 participating nations will register their players for the nations tournament to be held in Ivory Coast from January 13th to February 11th. The clubs are subject to an obligation imposed by the world association Fifa, otherwise they face severe contractual penalties. This also applies to the Asian Cup in Qatar, which is being held at the same time and in the same format. The Alassane Ouattara Olympic Stadium is one of the six arenas hosting the Africa Cup of Nations Which: AFP/SIA KAMBOU The tournaments will have a massive influence on the operations of the major European leagues. The Bundesliga is hit hard. 33 players from 13 clubs will be absent and will miss up to five championship games and, in some cases, the DFB Cup quarter-finals at the end of January and beginning of February. That hurts, especially since the players earn their money in the clubs and not in the national teams. Leverkusen and Stuttgart are hit the hardest The main victims in this country are two top clubs. In addition to league leaders Leverkusen, VfB Stuttgart will also have to do without five players. Alonso’s coaching colleague Sebastian Hoeneß cannot plan with striker Serhou Guirassy (Guinea), winger Silas (DR Congo), defender Hiroki Ito (Japan), nor midfielders Genki Haraguchi (Japan) and Woo-yeong Jeong (South Korea). The absence of Guirassy is particularly worrying. Because where would the third-place team be without their 17 goals? It’s just a good thing that VfB has another accurate striker in Deniz Undav (9 goals) who doesn’t have to travel to any tournaments in January. Nevertheless, sports director Fabian Wohlgemuth warned against believing that things would automatically continue like this in the second half of the season. “In my opinion, creating different expectations now makes no sense,” he said. Even if the fans are currently dreaming of the Champions League, this is not necessarily realistic. The Stuttgart team is planning to close the gaps as best as possible from the existing squad and possibly also bring in youth players. There is hardly any money for winter transfers. It will probably be similar in Leverkusen – although Xabi Alonso has significantly more alternatives. Alonso leaves all African Cup candidates out He was able to see this for himself on Wednesday. Then the Basque tested the emergency. Against Bochum, Alonso didn’t have the Africa Cup candidates in the starting line-up – and was then able to reassure himself that things were going well. The Werkself won 4-0, it was their 25th competitive game without defeat in a row. “I think it wasn’t a risk. “I’m not taking any risks before a Bundesliga game,” he explained afterwards. It was particularly important that Patrik Schick, who started for Boniface, was able to make a statement: the Czech, who had been injured for a long time and was starting for the first time in months, scored three times. “He needed this feeling,” said Alonso: “It was important for him to come back very strongly in January.” Because then Schick is urgently needed. also read What is striking is how calmly they deal with the circumstances in Leverkusen. “It is definitely a challenge and of course there are more beautiful constellations. But we still believe that we have a broad squad and that we can handle this. “Nevertheless, they are top players that we don’t like to miss out on,” said sports director Simon Rolfes to “Bild”. He doesn’t want to rule out transfers – but even if the financial leeway in Leverkusen is greater than in Stuttgart: the chance of finding players in the short term who can immediately compensate for the loss of quality is slim. Bayern Munich is much more worried. The second-placed team will probably have to do without Min-Jae Kim (South Korea), Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting (Cameroon) and the currently injured Noussair Mazroui (Morocco). When it comes to the record champions, of all places, alternatives are rare. Most recently in the 3-0 win over Stuttgart, Thomas Tuchel was only able to rely on 15 field players. The fact that they have to survive four points behind Leverkusen (with one game less) increases the pressure on Bayern – especially on sporting director Christoph Freund.
