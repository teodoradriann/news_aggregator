    "text": "WATCH: Curious fox steals animal rescuer's phone, takes selfie video Published in [Cats & Dogs News](/homeandleisure/pets/catsanddogs/) (UPI) An RSPCA officer in Britain set up his phone to film an animal rescue, but a curious fox snatched the device and ran away with it while it was still recording. Animal Rescue Officer Ben Fitzcosta said he responded to a wooded area in Bagshot on a report of a fox with an injured leg. Fitzcosta located what he believed to be the injured fox and set up his phone to record video of the capture. \"There were actually two foxes in the woodland, someone called the RSPCA to report that one of them was injured,\" Fitzcosta said in an RSPCA news release. I set up my phone to film and as I was preparing to catch the fox with food and a grasper he ran up, sniffed the phone and ran off with it! The video shows the fox setting the phone down under a nearby bush and giving it a sniff, managing to take a selfie video in the process. Fitzcosta catches up to the animal and manages to get his phone back, saying: \"I can't believe that just happened.\" \"It did make my day to be honest, the video is very funny. I'm glad I got my phone back -- I had to jog to catch up with him as I knew he'd dump it in a bush somewhere,\" Fitzcosta said. The rescuer said he was then able to locate the second fox. \"I did find the injured fox and managed to rescue her, she is now being treated at Harper Asprey Wildlife Rescue as she has an inflamed leg from an old injury. Hopefully she will make a full recovery,\" he said. Copyright 2024 by United Press International Comments blog comments powered by Disqus",

    "text": "Cancelo: «Bernardo Silva é o melhor jogador português da atualidade»\nJoão Cancelo não tem dúvidas: Bernardo Silva é o melhor jogador português da atualidade. Em entrevista ao Podcast «Um para um», com Pedro Mendonça Pinto, o defesa do Barcelona deixou grandes elogios ao compatriota.\n«Para mim, o Bernardo Silva ÃƒÂ© o melhor jogador portuguÃƒÂªs da atualidade, mas essa ÃƒÂ© apenas a minha opiniÃƒÂ£o. Eu sou fÃƒÂ£ dele, a nÃƒÂ­vel pessoal e desportivo, ele sabe disso. Jogadores assim hÃƒÂ¡ muito poucos. Ãƒâ‚¬s vezes os portugueses nÃƒÂ£o valorizam muito e acho que deviam valorizar mais.Ã‚Â»\nJoão Cancelo é agora companheiro de equipa de João Félix no Barcelona. O lateral-direito acredita que o avançado passou algumas dificuldades de adaptação em Espanha, mas que Félix tem detalhes diferentes dos outros.\n«O FÃƒÂ©lix ÃƒÂ© um jogador com um talento puro. Em Portugal hÃƒÂ¡ muito talento, mas ele pode realmente fazer a diferenÃƒÂ§a. Tem detalhes diferentes dos outros, pelo menos dos jogadores com quem jÃƒÂ¡ joguei atÃƒÂ© agora.Ã‚Â NÃƒÂ£o foi fÃƒÂ¡cil, ainda para mais na idade dele. Saiu da zona de conforto, de perto dos pais, quando qualquer coisa corre mal ÃƒÂ© bom tÃƒÂª-los por perto. NÃƒÂ³s jogadores temos de estar habituados a isso. Ãƒâ€° um jogador muito mediÃƒÂ¡tico aqui em Espanha, ÃƒÂ© uma coisa incrÃƒÂ­vel. Qualquer coisa que ele faÃƒÂ§a, para o bem ou para o mal, vai ser manchete no jornal. HÃƒÂ¡ que saber lidar com isso.Ã‚Â»\nNa mesma entrevista, João Cancelo revelou quem é o seu maior ídolo.\n«O Ronaldinho ÃƒÂ© o meu maior ÃƒÂ­dolo. Foi o jogador que eu mais vibrei a ver jogar. NÃƒÂ£o teve a consistÃƒÂªncia de 15 ou 20 anos, mas foi o jogador mais talentoso que vi jogar, o maior talento puro, em termos de magia era incrÃƒÂ­vel. Com a rivalidade que hÃƒÂ¡ entre Real Madrid e Barcelona, ele meter o BernabÃƒÂ©u a aplaudi-loÃ¢â‚¬Â¦em alguma coisa ele tinha de ser diferente. Pagava-se para ir vÃƒÂª-lo jogar.Ã‚Â»\nVeja a entrevista a João Cancelo na íntegra:",

Chromosomes, which carry all of our genetic instructions, must be copied in a complete way during cell division. Telomeres, which cap the ends of chromosomes, play a critical role in this cell-renewal process—with a direct bearing on health and disease.\nThe enzyme telomerase plays a key role in maintaining the length of telomeres as chromosomes replicate during cell division. UC Santa Cruz professor Carol Greider has been studying telomeres and telomerase for over 30 years. The impact of the discoveries she has made over that time are why she, along with two colleagues, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009.\nSo, the findings of Greider’s latest study on telomeres shouldn’t have surprised her. And yet, they did.\nPublished online today in Science , a new study finds that telomere lengths follow a different pattern than has thus far been understood. Instead of telomere lengths falling under one general range of shortest to longest across all chromosomes, this study finds that different chromosomes have separate end-specific telomere-length distributions.\nAccording to Greider, this discovery means we don’t fully understand the molecular process that regulates telomere lengths. And that’s important because of how telomere lengths affect human health: “When telomeres get to be too short, you have age-related degenerative diseases like pulmonary fibrosis, bone-marrow failure, and immunosuppression,” Greider said. “On the other hand, if telomeres are too long, it predisposes you to certain types of cancer.”\nKayarash Karimian, the lead author on the paper, is a former Ph.D. student in Greider’s lab at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Other co-authors of this study include researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, and University of Pittsburgh. Greider, a distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz, and a University Professor at Johns Hopkins, was the senior author on the paper and led the work.\nWhy length matters Without telomerase, telomeres would get shorter and shorter as a cell divides over and over again. Over the past 30 years, research by Greider and others have confirmed that short telomeres lead to degenerative disease—as well as shown that telomere lengths fall within a certain range.\nBut this paper challenges scientific consensus by showing that a singular telomere-length range is too broad. Measuring the telomeres of 147 people for this study, the researchers found in one individual that the average telomere length across all chromosomes was 4,300 bases of DNA. Then when they isolated specific chromosomes, they found most telomere lengths differed significantly from this average. In one case, lengths differed as much as 6,000 bases, which Greider describes as “jaw dropping.”\nFurther, they found across all 147 individuals the same telomeres were most often the shortest or longest, implying telomeres on specific chromosome ends may be the first to trigger stem-cell failure.\nInnovating on nanopore sequencing\nTo make such precise measurements at the molecular level, Greider’s team used a technique invented at UC Santa Cruz called “nanopore sequencing,” a revolutionary method for reading DNA and RNA that has had an immense impact on genomics research since its 2014 debut on the market as the commercial product MinION.\nNanopore technology has enabled some of the most significant advances in the genomics field, such as the completion of a gapless human genome , and sequencing of COVID-19 genomes—making it crucial in the fight to end the pandemic. UC Santa Cruz licensed the concept for nanopore-sequencing technology to the UK-based company Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which made MinION, the first hand-held DNA sequencer.\nNotably, in the eyes of nanopore sequencing’s inventors, Greider’s study proves that the technique’s ability to advance scientific research continues to unfold. Mark Akeson, emeritus professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, notes that two preprint studies that corroborate the basic findings of Greider’s paper have also been posted online.\n“In my opinion, this is the most important nanopore-based paper focused on human biology since the MinION was introduced,” Akeson said. “It is easy to envision broad use of their telomere-length assay in the clinic.”\nAkeson and David Deamer, also an emeritus professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering, were honored at the Library of Congress last year for inventing nanopore sequencing. Their colleague and friend Daniel Branton, a Havard biologist and co-inventor of the technology, was honored as well.\nImplications for disease prevention Such precise DNA reads allowed Greider’s team to pinpoint the sequences adjacent to telomeres and hypothesize that those areas are where telomerase is regulating length. And if that’s true, Greider said those regions, and the proteins that bind there, could serve as potential targets for new drugs for preventing disease.\nIn addition, their process of “telomere profiling” via nanopore sequencing could serve as a model for the development of additional MinION-based assays for high-throughput drug screening.\n“This accessible technique has widespread potential for use in research, diagnostics, and drug development,” Greider said. “This work indicates that there are yet undiscovered mechanisms for telomere length regulation; probing these mechanisms will inform new approaches to cancer and certain degenerative diseases.”\nThe study, “Human telomere length is chromosome end-specific and conserved across individuals,” was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R35CA209974 to Greider and R01HL166265), the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Distinguished Professorship, and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.",

Seems to be close to Shawnee on Delaware.— HoundLyfe (@HoundLyfe) [pic.twitter.com/xxlmErkK0o] [November 1, 2024] The red flag warning, [issued by the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, N.J.](https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=PHI&wwa=red%20flag%20warning), is in effect until 7 p.m. Friday. In addition to Lehigh and Northampton counties, the warning also covers a large swath of eastern Pennsylvania, including Carbon, Monroe, Berks, Delaware, Philadelphia and more. A red flag warning is issued when the risk of fire danger is highest, and residents are urged to be extremely cautious with any open flame. Any fires that develop may quickly get out of control and become difficult to contain.National Weather Service in Mount Holly “Any fires that develop may quickly get out of control and become difficult to contain,” according to the NWS. Under these conditions, cigarettes or matches tossed out of vehicles may ignite dry grass on the side of the road. Outdoor power equipment that creates sparks should not be used, and activities with open flames or sparks should be avoided. Winds are expected, with gusts up to 30 mph, forecasters said. Relative humidity could be as low as 27% with temperatures warming again, with highs up to 78 degrees. [The Valley on Thursday was classified as in either “moderate” or “severe” drought by the U.S. Drought Monitor after weeks of dry conditions](https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/environment-science/lehigh-valley-slips-into-stage-of-severe-drought). However, the state Department of Environmental Protection has the state listed as “normal” [for its Current Drought Declaration Status](https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/PlanningConservation/Drought/pages/default.aspx).",
