Despite a challenging start and recent wrist surgery, Kyrgios prevails in three sets, marking a promising return to the sport. Emma Raducanu also advances in the women's draw.\nAustralian tennis star Nick Kyrgios made an impressive return to competitive play by overcoming Mackenzie McDonald at the Miami Open. This marks Kyrgios' first match victory since October 2022, following an injury-driven hiatus. Kyrgios, who recently retired from a match due to wrist pain, displayed resilience as he clinched the win after an arduous three-set battle.\nThe match had a tough start for Kyrgios, dropping the first set under the challenging Miami heat. However, he regained his momentum and leveled the match with a strong serve performance, showcasing his determination. Ultimately, a strategic drop shot enabled him to capitalize on a break point, paving the way to victory.\nMeanwhile, in the women's draw, former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu advanced with a straight-sets win over Sayaka Ishii. Raducanu showcased her strength, serving six aces, and converting five break points. She now faces American Emma Navarro in the next round, highlighting a competitive lineup at the tournament.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

My love and adoration for him only grows.\" Video above: Emma Heming Willis 'not good' amid husband Bruce Willis' dementia battle The couple wed in 2009 and share two daughters together, Mabel and Evelyn.

In February, Willis's family – including Heming, ex-wife Demi Moore and his daughters – [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/entertainment/bruce-willis-dementia/index.html) that the actor has been diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or [FTD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737) for short. Heming, who has been open about her journey as Willis's primary caretaker on her social media ever since, said in her video this week that \"holidays are hard, anniversaries are hard.\" She added that \"building a community and connection\" has helped her get through it this year. \"That has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that,\" she said. Heming wrote in the caption to her Instagram video about receiving \"countless messages of love and support because Bruce is so beloved,\" and that these messages help her feel \"less alone.\" \"I wish I could answer all the messages because they are deep, raw and poetic but please know that I appreciate them so very much,\" she wrote. \"I am grateful to you.\"",

    "title": "Nassau County transgender athlete bill is a loser",
    "text": "[Opinion](/opinion) [Editorials](/opinion/editorials) Nassau County transgender athlete bill is a loser Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman has a knack for generating controversies that will advance his political agenda. His culture war crusade “to protect the integrity of women's sports” is now in its 2.0 version after the county legislature this week passed an impractical and likely illegal local law that seeks to ban transgender women and girls from using more than 100 athletic county facilities unless they play on male or coed teams. Soon after Blakeman signs the law that no one demanded to resolve a problem that doesn't exist, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the state attorney general are expected to sue. Blakeman will get more of the headlines he craves while taxpayers will receive more costly legal bills. Blakeman has already lost two lawsuits on this issue after he tried to put the ban in place by royal decree in February, forcing federal and state court judges to remind him that mere elected officials must abide by the law. That's why it was so difficult for an attorney from Nassau County's law department to defend the bill when challenged by legislators at Monday's hearing. This law, only for women's sporting events, would apply equally to private and public school teams, recreational leagues of all ages, charity events, and even competitive professional and amateur adult teams with their own rules on participation. Yet when asked for evidence for why the sweeping law was needed, the county had little to show. There were no instances in Nassau of a woman or girl harmed by a transgender player and no data that those on teams playing against transgender players suffered more injuries. Nor was there any research about which sports, if any, were more likely to have such injuries occur. The county could only cite four cases, one in Canada, where an injury was reportedly caused by a transgender player. The county could not name one example of a team unfairly winning a sports event because there was a transgender woman on the team. And how would this law be enforced? To get approval to use a facility, a representative from each team participating would be required to sign a form that there are no transgender women on the team, even if the team welcomes such individuals. But what if a transgender athlete did play on a women's team at a county facility? The county's only answer was that punishment would be on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the county implausibly argues that Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding, will override New York's human rights law which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. If Draft Kings offered that bet, fortunes could be made overnight. There can be no real winner in a game that stigmatizes and bullies vulnerable young people making difficult statements about who they are.

    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. – Central Floridians, brace yourselves as a big winter blast is coming and staying through for quite a stretch!\nA one, two punch is expected to move into the area over the next 10 days, ushering in some of the coldest weather we have seen in years.\nJetstream Outlook This wave of cold air is driven by the jet stream, which is like a “fast river of air” in the upper levels of the atmosphere atmosphere, influencing the path and intensity of these fronts. Each dip seen in the upper atmosphere allows another influx of cold air to settle over the region.\nFRIDAY-WEEKEND:\nThe first punch of cold air is forecast to track through with little fanfare late Friday. Ahead of the front, highs will remain below average in the mid 60s with lows in the 40s. But by Saturday, another cool and sunny day sets up in the low 60s with the coldest point of the weekend on Sunday morning.\nWake up temperatures are expected to dip back into the upper 30s to low 40s with patchy frost possible. Temperatures will moderate a bit back to near 70 by Sunday afternoon.\nMorning Low Trend NEXT WEEK\nThe most significant cold front we’ve seen in years for Central Florida arrives Monday. Before the front clears it will be a warm day with highs running above average in the mid to upper 70s. As the front moves overhead, a few scattered showers can’t be ruled out with coverage minimal at only 20-30%.\nIn its wake, temperatures are expected to plunge about 20 degrees starting Tuesday. Forecast shows highs remaining in the 50s from Tuesday through next weekend with lows dropping into the 30s almost areawide, with some locations entering into the 20s.\nHigh Temp Trend The last time we’ve seen a stretch of daytime temperatures staying in the 50s was a 6-day stretch in January 2018.\nFor the latest weather updates and alerts, visit ClickOrlando.com .
