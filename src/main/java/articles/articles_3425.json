    "text": "Isère Les salariés de Valeo de nouveau mobilisés, l’avocat Fiodor Rilov à la rescousse Ce vendredi 13 septembre, un peu moins d’une centaine de salariés de Valeo sont mobilisés devant le site de leur entreprise. Ils ont reçu la visite du célèbre avocat en droit social Fiodor Rilov, du barreau de Paris. Ce dernier s’était notamment illustré en accompagné les salariés de Goodyear et de Continental. Il pourrait cette fois-ci s’occuper des Nord-Iserois de Valeo. « Sa venue est très importante pour nous, pour mettre la pression sur la direction, pour nous conseiller car nous sommes des novices dans ce domaine. Il va nous apporter son expérience, son expertise. Pour montrer qu’on ne peut pas délocaliser la production pour gagner encore plus de pognon et lancer dans le même temps un vaste plan de licenciement économique » confie Serge Gonnellaz, délégué syndical Sud. Depuis plusieurs semaines, le salariés de l’équipementier automobile ont entamé un combat social contre la direction. Direction qui a annoncé le 15 juillet dernier qu’elle cherchait un repreneur pour son site de Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, jugé trop peu rentable.",

    "title": "Senate GOP Blocks Democrats’ ‘Radical’ Contraception Bill for Threatening Parental Rights, Religious Liberty",
    "text": "Senate Republicans on Thursday successfully blocked a “radical” contraception bill, which they say undermined parental rights and religious liberty.\n“In the coming weeks, Senate Democrats will put reproductive freedoms front and center before this chamber so that the American people can see for themselves who will stand up to defend their fundamental liberties,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said, with CBS News noting that the bill was not expected to pass.\nDemocrats sold the bill as one that would codify the right to contraception in federal law. Lawmakers cited the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision — which overturned the invented federal right to abortion created under Roe v. Wade — and claimed the right to contraception may similarly be under threat if the Supreme Court ever decided to overturn its previous decisions upholding access.\n“Today, we live in a country where not only tens of millions of women have been robbed of their reproductive freedoms. We also live in a country where tens of millions more worry about something as basic as birth control,” Schumer said Wednesday morning on the Senate floor. “That’s utterly medieval.”\nRepublicans and pro-life groups countered that access to contraception is not under threat and accused the bill of being a trojan horse that disregards the views of many Americans.\nAhead of the vote, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) led a majority of senators in a memo calling the revival of the bill an effort to deceive voters and “score cheap political points.”\n“There is no threat to access to contraception, which is legal in every state and required by law to be offered at no cost by health insurers, and it’s disgusting that Democrats are fearmongering on this important issue to score cheap political points,” the memo read, concluding:\nThis bill infringes on the parental rights and religious liberties of some Americans and lets the federal government force religious institutions and schools, even public elementary schools, to offer contraception like condoms to little kids. It’s just another way for Democrats to use activist attorneys and our courts to advance their radical agenda and that is why we oppose this bill.\nLeading pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony (SBA) Pro-Life America also put out a statement ahead of the vote, warning that the bill would override conscience protections. The bill’s text explicitly states that it would override the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n“While pro-life Americans celebrate two years of lives protected in the Dobbs era this June, Senate Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are planning a month-long campaign of fearmongering and demonizing pro-life protections,” SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said:\nThe Democrats’ deceptive Payouts to Planned Parenthood Act has less to do with access to contraception than with funneling taxpayer dollars to the abortion industry and crushing dissent. Contraception is legal and available in every state and Congress funds contraception through numerous federal programs every year.\n“With this bill, the devil is in the details. It requires taxpayers to bail out profit-driven abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood, where expectant mothers are sold abortions 97% of the time ,” she continued. “It could even go so far as to create a ‘right’ to abortion drugs. It’s clear the Democrats’ priority is not helping women, but helping the abortion lobby that spends millions to get them elected.”\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

    "text": "Brittany Loy and her soldier husband were moving out of The Villages at [Fort Moore](https://www.military.com/base-guide/fort-moore), Georgia, this spring as they headed to a new posting in Alaska when they found out they were on the hook for a $2,000 move-out fee. The bill included the cost to replace the air conditioning unit in the home's back yard. An inspector reportedly found \"a small piece of corrosion in the bottom corner of the unit\" and blamed the deterioration on the family's male dog, Loy said. She hadn't noticed whether the damage was there when moving in and estimated that at least two other families had lived in the house during the life of the unit. The full amount to replace it \"would have required us to pay $700 out of pocket,\" which the one-income household \"did not have,\" Loy said in an interview. So she contacted the Military Housing Coalition for help.

The neighborhood where the Loys lived is part of the Michaels Organization, a real estate development and management company responsible for roughly 18,000 houses at 11 military installations. A spokesperson for the Michaels Organization declined to comment on the fee in question or the company's practices when assessing move-out fees. The company has been in the news over its use of [non-disclosure agreements](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/03/30/98-military-families-silenced-nondisclosure-agreements-private-base-housing-companies.html) for tenants amid heightened scrutiny over base housing conditions. When a family lives in privatized base housing, for the most part, the service member's entire [Basic Allowance for Housing](https://www.military.com/benefits/military-pay/basic-allowance-for-housing/basic-allowance-for-housing-rates.html) goes directly to the local housing operator. In the last month in which the family lives there, the housing company typically prorates the amount for rent, then either cuts the family a check for the balance of the month or deducts money for move-out fees. The fees that the remaining [BAH](https://www.military.com/benefits/military-pay/basic-allowance-for-housing) doesn't cover come out of the family's pocket. Sources have [previously described](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/03/28/will-tenant-bill-of-rights-fix-privatized-military-housing.html) the process for resolving fee disputes -- which varies from base to base and company to company -- as not only \"arduous\" but even \"frightening.\" Once the Military Housing Coalition started asking questions on the Loys' behalf, the housing operator reduced the fee for the air conditioning unit to $698, Loy said -- low enough that the month's remaining BAH covered it all with some left over. In the end, the Loys got a $300 refund out of the month's BAH with the reduced air conditioning fee. Loy said she asked The Villages at Fort Moore to provide proof that it replaced the A/C unit but had not received any such confirmation. The Defense Department doesn't track move-out fees to know whether a given base or housing company is more likely to charge them, a spokesperson confirmed by email, adding that move-out fees \"are negotiated between the individual Military Departments and [housing] companies\" and that the DoD is \"committed to ensuring ... fair treatment\" of tenants by the housing operators. Hall said she's never heard of a tenant successfully asserting one dispute provision that's supposed to be available to families -- the \"right\" to withhold rent payments during a dispute. The rent \"is supposed to go into an escrow account,\" Hall said, \"and we've yet to see that actually happen.\" Congressional Office Weighs In on Carpet Fee [Army](https://www.military.com/army) [spouse](https://www.military.com/spouse) Ayanna DeCruise said the military housing office at [Fort Campbell](https://www.military.com/base-guide/fort-campbell), Kentucky, initially denied her and her spouse access to the formal dispute resolution process there -- because they were \"no longer a tenant\" -- after being charged to replace all the carpet in the house they moved out of this year. The Tenant Bill of Rights, a series of protections for families required by Congress in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, guarantees \"access to a Military Tenant Advocate\" either through a base's housing office or a military legal assistant. DeCruise sought the help of a military attorney at the family's new post, [Fort Stewart](https://www.military.com/base-guide/fort-stewart), Georgia. When moving out of the Campbell Crossing neighborhood, DeCruise said the move-out inspection felt \"very rushed and unexplained.\" The inspector never pointed out any carpet stains during the inspection itself, DeCruise said. However, the inspector then informed the couple they would have to pay more than $800 to replace the carpet -- and the family of six had to get from Kentucky to Fort Stewart by the next day. The inspector told her they had a choice: Pay on the spot with a card or have the money deducted from her spouse's paycheck. They handed over their card number to the inspector. A spokesperson for Lendlease Communities, which operates Campbell Crossing, did not address DeCruise's case in response to a query by Military.com but said the company provides residents \"with as many moving resources as possible while transparently communicating the move-out process with detailed guides, educational videos and FAQs.\" A Campbell Crossing [move-out rate guide](https://medialibrarycf.entrata.com/12710/MLv3/2024/06/06/020224/666215d08969a139.pdf) linked in the response omitted rates for \"Rolled Carpet\" and \"Carpet Squares,\" however, for which it advised residents to \"See Community Office.\" The Military Housing Coalition figured out that Campbell Crossing hadn't applied a formula to account for automatic depreciation of the carpet's value over time, so the family got $152 back. Still, DeCruise isn't convinced that the carpet damage she described as spots that were \"smaller than palm sized\" should have put the family on the hook for replacing all the carpet in the house. Hall, from the Military Housing Coalition, said she understood that families moving out of Campbell Crossing only had to vacuum the carpets anyway and that small stains would be charged individually per \"square.\" The Military Housing Coalition ultimately looped in the office of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. In a letter in response to questions from McConnell's office, Fort Campbell's garrison commander, Army Col. Christopher Midberry, said a review concluded that the family had been \"reasonably charged for damage to the carpet.\" A constituent services manager for McConnell's office suggested that DeCruise's husband submit a complaint to the Army's inspector general. Fort Campbell's public affairs office did not respond to a query about the case. Lendlease [announced in July](https://www.lendlease.com/siteassets/lendlease/shared/investor-centre/announcements/asx/2024/07/2741261.pdf) that it's selling its military housing portfolio of more than 40,000 homes.

However, it failed to acknowledge the simple fact that products of mining are not only essential for our modern lifestyle, but also help to insure America’s continued prosperity. We use products from mining in our homes, businesses and routine daily activities. This is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. Those who demonize mining refuse to recognize industry’s efforts to resolve environmental issues resulting from historical mining activities as well as its development of new technologies and mining practices that minimize negative impacts from current and future operations. Improvements can be made to further reduce many of its undesirable impacts. Today’s mining professionals are working hard to make this a reality.

    "text": "Bishop Schneider Says His New Compendium Aims to ‘Expel the Darkness’ of Relativism and Ambiguity in Doctrine The Kazakh auxiliary bishop launched the publication of Credo — Compendium of the Catholic Faith Oct. 26 in Rome. VATICAN CITY — A new compendium of the Catholic faith has been published that aims to provide clear answers to many of contemporary problems as well as counter the ambiguity and relativism now prevalent in both Western society and in the Church. Written by Auxiliary Bishop Athanasius Schneider of Astana, Kazakhstan, Credo —Compendium of the Catholic Faith (Sophia Institute Press) is the first such work by a Catholic bishop in more than 50 years, and aims to help the reader to know what to believe, how to live, and how to pray as Christ taught. As well as providing a clear and concise summary of Catholicism as a whole, the book applies the truths of the faith to many scourges of our time such as gender ideology, transhumanism, drug use, social media use and pornography — issues that were not prevalent when the Catechism of the Catholic Church was promulgated by Pope St. John Paul II in 1992. In this Oct. 26 interview with the Register in Rome, Bishop Schneider discusses more about his reasons for writing the compendium, what contemporary problems concern him the most, and how confident he is that the Church’s immutable teaching on faith and morals can return to prominence in this so-called “post-truth era.” Your Excellency, what prompted you to write this compendium? What prompted me to write this compendium is my concern for the simple faithful and also for seminarians and priests in view of the very widespread doctrinal confusion, which has infected the Church in recent decades — not only in the current pontificate, in which the confusion is very evident, but also in the decades after the Second Vatican Council, and in the Council itself, relating to some ambiguities in doctrine. These ambiguities grew over past decades. As St. Thomas Aquinas says, “A small error at the beginning will grow and become a great error in the end.” So I wanted to offer this compendium as a help, as a pastoral help. The bishop has a mission, defined by his episcopal consecration, to be a teacher of the faith as a successor of the apostles. I feel this deeply in my soul — this duty to share, to give, as a teacher of the faith, with the faithful and priests — to offer this compendium to help expel the darkness of confusion in doctrine, in morals and in the liturgy. They are all connected. And by doing this, I tried always to base my answers on the Fathers of the Church, on the magisterium — not my own opinion, but to give voice to the constant and sure tradition of the Church. You list many contemporary problems and offer a blueprint on how to effectively respond to them. What are most pressing problems in your view, and which ones are in need of clear answers that only the Church can give? The most pressing are relativism in doctrine in general and, concretely, within the relativizing of doctrine, the issue of the pluralism of religions, as they say today. The phenomenon which is called interreligious dialogue has been promoted since the Council. This creates, for me, the most profound danger: the relativism of truth itself, in the sense of relativizing the uniqueness of Jesus Christ, the uniqueness of the Catholic faith and Church by this sometimes ambiguous teaching on the diversity of religions and practice. In the magisterial text of the Council, and after the Council, they restate that, of course, Our Lord is the unique redeemer and so on. But along with stating this truth, at the same time there are affirmations which undermine it by essentially saying that to choose, exercise and spread any religion, even a wrong religion, is a matter of conscience and so a natural right. But this is ambiguous because our natural right is a positive will of God; and not only a permission through which God permits an evil. And therefore this formulation is at the base, at the foundation, of this current relativism — in spite of stating at the same time the uniqueness of Jesus Christ. It’s a kind of dialectic — that is, you make a statement and then another statement you relativize it. This is our problem — what Pope St. Pius X characterized as modernism which states the truth and then, at the same time, undermines it. How much has a lack of clear teaching by many Church leaders on these issues for the past decades, and which prompted you to write this book, led us to this place of ambiguity, especially on morals, that you describe? It started with some ambiguous statements, more on the doctrinal issues in the Council, and then, I repeat, through these ambiguous ecumenical and interreligious meetings and practices in morals. Thanks be to God, the clarity of moral teaching was kept at the Council and the post-conciliar magisterium. Paul VI in [Humanae Vitae](https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html) is clear, and then there were several statements of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on homosexuality, on sexuality, on abortion, and so on. And then especially there was John Paul II, his magisterium and encyclical [Veritatis Splendor](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor.html) on morality, which is very clear and thanks be to God this was kept. But with Pope Francis, relativism and systematic ambiguity, even in moral teachings, continued. This started with the Council and some with these repeat interreligious practices, but doctrinal confusion and moral relativism have reached new depths with Pope Francis. You also talk about the scourges of our time such as gender ideology, transhumanism, pornography, and drug use. What concerns you most about these? Yes, indeed, besides the relativism regarding the uniqueness of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church, the most dangerous in my opinion is the attack on the divine order of creation of man, as male and female. This is a basic, almost satanic attack, and revolt against the human creation of God. This is even, to some extent, an apocalyptical attack and revolt against this beautiful creation of God, of two sexes, male and female, through the global totalitarian ideology, the so-called gender or “LGBT” ideology. This I consider one of the most dangerous scourges of contemporary life. How do you hope Credo will be used in a practical sense? Where do you see it being most effectively used as a point of reference? The text is in the form of short answers to questions, so in a style that is easy to read for the ordinary person, and therefore very helpful also from a didactical point of view. I hope it can be a resource for teachers, those who will instruct children and youth. From this compendium they can choose questions more apt for the age of those who they will teach. The more difficult questions such as the several levels of magisterium, or Freemasonry, or those other aspects of doctrine that are difficult are more suitable for, let us say, those already well-trained such as young adults, seminarians or priests. The format is reminiscent of the compendium that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger wrote on the Catechism of the Catholic Church back in the 2000s. How much does your compendium have in common with his, or differ from it, would you say? What they have in common are really the style of question and answers, that it is written as a kind of dogmatic handbook or manual. But whereas the compendium of Benedict XVI is very short and with very few explanations, I provide in the footnotes more extensive explanations so the reader can explain an answer more deeply if asked. This is also because I wanted to help the reader explain the roots of some problems of our time, of the ambiguities and relativism. Given the extent of moral relativism in both society and the Church and what’s sometimes called our “post-truth era,” how confident are you that the Church’s immutable teaching on faith and morals can return to prominence? And do you foresee other similar efforts to Credo being part of that effort? Yes, it is exactly in view of this tremendous moral confusion in the society of our time that the Church has prophetic appeal. The mission of the Church and of the apostles is to always be a prophetic voice, to provide a prophetical answer to the needs of the time. Pope John XXIII and the other popes after the Council said, “The Church must recognize and be aware of the signs of the times.” But the response was partly wrong because in our modern time and in our current culture there is a revolt against Christ, against divine revelation, against the perennial validity and the objectivity of truth and morals. Even before the Council, a characteristic of modern times was to abandon Christ, to abandon the revelation of God and to exalt the human being above the revelation of God, above the truth. And in some ways, the Council tried to gain sympathy from the world instead of presenting, with great clarity, the clear teaching of God, of Christ, of course in a respectful away and with love to our modern world which has abandoned God. And now it is worse. The prophetic mission of the Church is again to teach the entire world, to remind humanity of the beauty, clarity and perennial validity of the truth of God regarding the uniqueness of Christ in the Catholic Church, and regarding the moral law. The Church must now unite all people of goodwill in this almost apocalyptic battle to defend family and marriage, to defend the human being as male and female, and family and marriage, and then to defend life against the horrendous, almost global genocide of the unborn. In essence, you’re also calling on all to place God at the center again of their life through the right liturgy, to honor and love God above all things? Yes, exactly, also through prayer. This is a task of the Church amid this almost general chaos: to establish, again, in the liturgy, the dignity, the sacredness, the sublimity of worship, which will also heal the wounds of people who are wounded by immorality and confusion and help them, through the right worship, to experience the beauty of God and His truths. This can be given now, through the treasure which the Church has in her traditional literature, which must again be opened to the people of our time. - Keywords: [bishop athanasius schneider](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/bishop-athanasius-schneider)",
