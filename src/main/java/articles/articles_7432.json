    "text": "A local court in Rawalpindi on Thursday sent Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi on a 14-day judicial remand in a case pertaining to the May 9 riots. The court, presided by Duty Magistrate Syed Jahangir Ali, had earlier reserved its decision on a police request seeking physical remand of the former foreign minister. During the hearing earlier in the day, Qureshi informed the court that he was “tortured” by the authorities in prison last night. Qureshi was briefly released and then re-arrested by police from Adiala jail on Wednesday. Footage of the incident, widely circulated on social media, depicts policemen forcefully ushering the PTI leader towards an armoured vehicle. He was brought to court under a heavy police escort, with a video shared by PTI on its social media page showing the former minister handcuffed while walking towards the courtroom. However, when he reached the courtroom, the judge asked the police to remove his handcuffs. As the hearing commenced, Qureshi requested the court to record his statement first. He said that the apex court had granted him bail but before he could obtain his release order, it emerged that he was to be detained under 3 MPO. He questioned how could he be a threat to the public if he was incarcerated for many months. The former minister said he had been detained from Adiala jail illegally and police officials had kicked and ridiculed him. He added that despite repeated requests that he be taken to a doctor, he was not provided medical assistance. Qureshi further said that he was approached by a team to record his statement about the riots that occurred on May 9. “I was in Karachi on May 9,” he said adding that his wife was undergoing surgery on the day. Narrating the treatment allegedly meted out to him, Qureshi said he was kept in a cold cell overnight, with only a candle for illumination and was not allowed to sleep. “I was tortured physically and mentally.” The prosecutor requested the court for a three-day physical remand of the former foreign minister and argued that remand in cases with terrorism provisions allow a remand for even 90 days. He added that he also had reports from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and Pemra. The prosecution claimed that they had found evidence against Qureshi and the same was also collected from social media. Referring to the PTI leader’s speech on May 9, the prosecutor alleged that although Qureshi was not among those who attacked the GHQ, but his speech led to the attack. He further stated that during Qureshi’s physical remand, the police would further investigate Qureshi’s role and sought the PTI leader’s custody till January 2. However, Qureshi’s counsel Ali Bukhari argued that his client should be discharged from the case. “The prosecution just has a single tweet against my client,” he maintained. Bukhari maintained that Qureshi was kept in “unlawful custody for 24 hours”. The counsel said that the purpose of the physical remand was to “torture” his client and maintained that punishments could not be given in supplementary cases, adding that Qureshi’s name was not written on the charge sheet by the police. On Dec 22, a three-member Supreme Court bench granted bail to Qureshi and PTI founder Imran Khan in a case concerning the alleged misuse of a diplomatic cipher during the latter part of the PTI’s rule. Qureshi had previously served as the foreign minister in former prime minister Imran’s cabinet. Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hassan Waqar Cheema, on December 25, issued an executive order under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance to detain Qureshi for 15 days. Curiously, the deputy commissioner rescinded that order on Wednesday morning, leading to the PTI leader’s release from prison by jail authorities. However, a substantial police and Elite Force presence was already assembled outside the prison when the former foreign minister was set free. Moments before his re-arrest, Qureshi addressed the media, asserting that although the Supreme Court granted him bail, he was being unlawfully detained once more. “This is an injustice against me; I am being targeted for political vengeance,” he stated.",

    "title": "Avoid these mistakes: Canadians risk losing up to $100K by ignoring these low-risk investment options - News",
    "text": "One of the keys to building wealth is understanding the relationship between risk and reward. Canadians are always on the lookout for low-risk investments, but you must understand that free lunches do not exist. A risk-free investment (like a GIC) has a lower expected return than a high-risk investment (like an individual stock).\nAs an investor, your goal should be to balance the trade-off between risk and reward and find investments to suit your risk tolerance. Here are four low-risk investment options to consider, plus one really terrible low-risk option and one option that was so bad it’s no longer available.\nHigh-interest savings accounts\nWe should all keep some cash savings on hand in case of emergencies. The standard rule for emergency funds is to have three to six months of expenses in cash. Still, no one wants their cash sitting idly by earning nothing. That’s where a high-interest savings account comes into play.\nThe best high-interest savings accounts in Canada offer rates that keep up with inflation, but you’ll likely need to stray from the big banks to find them. Plus, it’s a safe bet to park your money in a HISA: savings deposits at most banks and credit unions are insured by Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) for up to $100,000 in case of bank failure. Investments don’t get much more low risk than that.\nGuaranteed investment certificates (GICs)\nOne step above a savings account, GICs are another low-risk investment option that can pay slightly higher interest depending on the length of your term. Most GICs come in terms of one to five years — the longer the term, the higher the interest rate.\nKnow that with a GIC you’re locking in your money for the length of the term. A steep penalty may apply if you withdraw your funds before the term expires. That’s why GICs make the most sense when you have a specific goal you’re saving for, such as a new car or a down payment on a house in three years.\nMoney market funds\nMoney market funds were once the go-to place for investors to park cash on the sidelines. It is a mutual fund that invests only in cash or cash-like instruments to provide investors with a safe and liquid place to hold onto their money.\nToday, most money market funds fail to keep up with inflation so investors looking for a low-risk investment option are better off with a high-interest savings account or GIC.\nTo make matters worse, money market mutual funds come with a management expense ratio (MER) that further eats into the already low rate of return.\nLow-volatility fund\nThe goal of many investors is to maximize return and minimize risk. But how can you achieve this goal when your funds are invested in the stock market? Answer: A low-volatility fund.\nZLB, BMO’s low-volatility ETF, is an enticing option as a low-risk/high-return investment. Choosing low-volatility investments is a proven strategy: Lower-risk stocks tend to outperform higher-risk ones across a longer time period.\nZLB is a five-star Morningstar-rated fund, has the best risk-adjusted return in the Canadian Equity category, and is the top-performing Canadian Equity Fund for over five years.\nInvestors looking to add market exposure through a low-volatility ETF like ZLB can do so by opening a discount brokerage account at Questrade and purchasing the ETF through their self-directed platform.\nAnnuities\nAn annuity is a contract designed to provide you with a guaranteed income stream. Typically used during retirement, annuities are sold by an annuity provider, such as a life insurance company.\nYou purchase an annuity with a lump sum and then receive payments for a fixed period or the remainder of your life. The payments are a mix of interest income and return of capital (i.e. paying back some of your own money).\nThe amount of money you receive depends on your gender, age, health, the amount of money you invest and the type of annuity you purchase. Other variables include whether you want payments to continue to your beneficiary after you die, the length of time you want to receive payments and the rate of interest at the time you buy your annuity.\nBuying an annuity late in retirement can be a great way to protect yourself from longevity risk (the risk that you outlive your money) by transferring risk from your personal savings to the insurance company.\nCanada savings bonds (no longer available)\nOnce a staple of low-risk investments for Canadian families, the Canadian federal government decided to stop issuing Canada Savings Bonds as of November 1, 2017. Still, existing Canada Savings Bonds and Canada Premium Bonds will continue to earn interest until maturity or redemption. Once a certified CSB or CPB matures, it no longer earns interest and should be redeemed by presenting the certificate at any financial institution in Canada. These savings bonds paid out a solid 4.75% as recently as 2000, but the interest rate fell to a pitiful 0.5% in their final years of issuance.\nWhen to buy low-risk investments\nSome investors are naturally risk-averse and cannot stand the idea of losing money. For these people, it’s great to know there are so many low-risk investment options available. But risk avoiders should understand there are no safe investments with high returns. The best risk-free investments will simply tread water with inflation (currently hovering around 2%).\nLow-risk investments are also ideal for short-term savers. The fact is, if you need to access your money for a major purchase in five years or less, then you shouldn’t invest that money in the market. It’s perfectly reasonable to stash your cash in a high-interest savings account or GIC and earn a healthy return on your cash.\nWhen to take additional risks\nIf you don’t need to access your money within five years, you should consider some exposure to the stock market. The key is to add bonds to the mix. There’s a reason why bonds exist – to smooth out the volatility of stock returns.\nA risk-averse investor could also look to a reputable robo-advisor like Wealthsimple to construct a conservative portfolio that can give their savings a chance at higher returns.\nWealthsimple’s conservative portfolio is made up of 35% equities and 65% fixed income (bonds). It uses ETFs with low-volatility characteristics to get exposure to international and emerging markets, plus a small mix of core Canadian and U.S. equity ETFs to round out the portfolio.\nThis conservative portfolio would have declined only 10% during the horrendous financial crisis of 2008. Other stocks saw declines of up to 60% that year.\nAre there safe investments with high returns?\nUltimately, there are no low-risk, high-return investments. But there are a number of places for risk-averse investors to park their savings and still keep up with, or beat, inflation.\nThat means looking beyond the big banks for better rates on high-interest savings accounts and GICs. It means avoiding costly money market funds and considering low-volatility funds, either purchased on your own through a self-directed investing platform or as part of a portfolio constructed for you by a robo-advisor.\nIt also means considering annuities in your retirement to protect your nest egg from longevity risk. All are solid options for you to build wealth and meet your financial goals.\nThis article Best low-risk investmentsoriginally appeared on Money.ca\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Entonces, ¿quién va a controlar ese poder? Tener sistemas que saben más que la mayoría de la gente puede ser peligroso en las manos equivocadas y crear más inestabilidad a nivel geopolítico”, añadió.\nAsimismo, señaló que si esto ocurriera en cinco años, no estaremos preparados, argumentando que carecemos de métodos para asegurarnos de que estos sistemas no perjudiquen a las personas o no se vuelvan contra ellas. “No sabemos cómo hacerlo”, admitió Bengio.\n“Si creamos entidades que son más inteligentes que nosotros y tienen sus propios objetivos, ¿qué significa eso para la humanidad? ¿Estamos en peligro?”, continuó. “Todas estas son preguntas muy difíciles e importantes, y no tenemos todas las respuestas. Necesitamos mucha más investigación y precaución para mitigar los potenciales riesgos”, concluyó.",

    "title": "Florida tropical threat to unleash torrential rain on the state | CNN",
    "text": "CNN — A state of emergency has been declared in parts of Florida in anticipation of a potential named storm capable of unleashing multiple days of heavy, flooding rainfall to the state and the southeast United States starting this weekend.\nA disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms over parts of Cuba and the southern Bahamas Friday will likely develop into a tropical depression once it emerges out over the water between Cuba and Florida by Friday night or Saturday.\nAn area of showers and thunderstorms expected to become a tropical depression or storm this weekend moves over the Caribbean Friday morning. CIRA/RAMMB/NOAA But the system’s exact track and strength after it becomes a depression are still uncertain. How much time the system spends over record-warm water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico will determine how strong it becomes.\nIt’s likely to track parallel to Florida’s Gulf Coast for some time this weekend and could strengthen into Tropical Storm Debby as it does so, before curving east and making landfall. The system’s strength would be limited if it moves quickly over Florida.\nNo matter its strength, torrential, flooding rain will be the most significant impact from the storm, especially if the system were to slow down, a possible scenario.\nThe flood threat prompted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency. The order was issued Thursday for 54 of the state’s 67 counties to mobilize state and local resources ahead of the storm.\nSandbag distribution began Friday for residents in several communities in the Orlando and Tampa metros. Multiple counties in the state’s panhandle – including Escambia, Okaloosa and Santa Rosa – started distributing sandbags Thursday.\nA level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Saturday for much of South Florida as the system organizes just off the coast, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n“Very intense” rainfall rates of 2.5 to 3 inches per hour are possible within the heaviest storms in the system’s outer rain bands Saturday, the WPC warned. Rainfall rates this potent are enough to cause flash flooding, even in marshy areas of the state more capable of handling excess water.\nThe risk to life and property would increase considerably if these intense storms reach the Miami area. Up to 20 inches of rain deluged South Florida in a very short window in early July and produced extremely dangerous flash flooding across the greater Miami metro, resulting in a couple hundred water rescues.\nThe level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall will expand over much of the state and reach into other portions of Georgia and the Carolinas Sunday.\nExactly when and where torrential downpours set up outside of Florida will depend on the system’s ultimate track, but heavy rain is possible as early as Sunday afternoon. It’s also possible that this risk level will increase – especially in Florida – once the system’s track comes into further focus.\nHeavy rain will continue to pound parts of the Southeast early next week, especially if, instead of tracking steadily along the Florida Gulf Coast and making landfall, the system slows down and stalls over one region – potentially around Florida’s Big Bend.\nRainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are possible through Monday over much of Florida and the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas. But if the system happens to stall, rainfall totals could increase dramatically.\nFreshwater flooding – flooding caused by rainfall – has become the deadliest aspect of tropical systems in the last decade, according to research conducted by the National Hurricane Center.\nA world warming due to fossil fuel pollution is making this potential threat more dangerous. Studies have also shown tropical systems are slowing down over time, which means they’re more likely produce greater rainfall totals over a given area.\nOceans are also getting warmer and supercharging storms , pumping them full of moisture. A 2022 study published in the journal Nature Communications found climate change increased hourly rainfall rates in tropical storms by 5 to 10% and in hurricanes by 8 to 11%.\nCNN’s Sara Smart contributed to this report.",

    "title": "3 rituales de limpieza espiritual que recomienda una experta para despedir el año",
    "text": "Los rituales de limpieza de fin de año son una tradición que se practica en muchas culturas y se cree que ayudan a eliminar las malas energías acumuladas durante el año y a preparar el hogar para el comienzo del año nuevo.\nSegún la creencia, la limpieza de fin de año es una oportunidad para deshacerse de todo lo que ya no necesitamos o que nos estorba en el día a día y puede ayudar a crear un espacio más limpio, ordenado y agradable para vivir.\nDesde un punto de vista energético, la limpieza de fin de año se puede considerar como un ritual de purificación . Se cree que las malas energías pueden acumularse en nuestro hogar a lo largo del año, debido a factores como el estrés, las discusiones o las emociones negativas.\nEs por eso, que no está de más hacer ciertos rituales para dejar todo lo malo atrás y para atraer cosas buenas para el siguiente año, como el amor , la riqueza, la abundancia y la salud.\nEn ese sentido, la psiquiatra Silvia Ruiz, formada en la Universidad de Harvard y Oxford , recomienda tres sencillos rituales de limpieza para esta época.\nLa especialista asegura que dichos rituales ayudan con la reducción del estrés , aportan mayor claridad mental y aumentan la productividad.\n3 rituales sencillos 1. Limpiar los espacios y retirar el polvo y la suciedad.\nSegún la experta, “ hay de deshacerse de objetos rotos y regalar la ropa que ya no se usa”. Agrega que, “limpiar y organizar puede ayudar a eliminar el desorden físico y mental, lo que a su vez puede reducir los niveles de estrés y crear un ambiente más tranquilo” .\n2. Limpiar las redes sociales.\n“Haz un filtro de las redes sociales . Analiza si estas están alineadas con tu paz mental y tu mental emocional”.\nRuiz asegura que esto aporta “mayor claridad mental: las limpiezas mentales y espirituales pueden proporcionar una mayor claridad mental y facilitar la toma de decisiones”.\nAdicionalmente, a segura que esto puede generar un aumento de la productividad: “la limpieza y organización de espacios físicos y digitales pueden aumentar la eficiencia y la productividad al eliminar distracciones y facilitar el acceso a lo que realmente importa”.\n3. Limpie y libere sus cargas emocionales.\n“Escribe en un papel tus preocupaciones, temores y frustraciones con aceptación y sin juicio. Estas limpiezas a menudo implican reflexión y autoexploración , lo que puede conducir a un mayor autoconocimiento y comprensión de uno mismo”.\nLa experta recomienda finalizar los rituales “ conectando contigo mismo, a través de una meditación revitalizante para tu espíritu”\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Mindfulness y Alimentación consciente (@silviaruizcala)\nOtro ritual para limpiar su espíritu El ritual se puede realizar en cualquier momento del día , pero es preferible hacerlo durante la noche, cuando la energía es más tranquila. Se puede realizar solo o en compañía de personas cercanas.\nPara realizar el ritual, necesitará los siguientes elementos:\nUna vela blanca: la vela blanca representa la pureza y la limpieza. Incienso: el incienso ayuda a crear un ambiente de paz y tranquilidad. Sal marina: la sal marina es un elemento purificador y protector. Un papel y un lápiz: escribirá en el papel todo lo que desea eliminar de su vida. Una vez que tenga todos los elementos, siga estos pasos:\nEncienda la vela blanca y el incienso. Coloque la sal marina en un círculo alrededor de usted mismo. Tome el papel y el lápiz y escriba en el papel todo lo que desea eliminar de su vida. Puede ser cualquier cosa, desde emociones negativas hasta situaciones o personas. Cuando haya terminado de escribir, queme el papel en la llama de la vela. Visualice cómo las malas energías se van con el humo de la vela. Cierre los ojos y respire profundamente durante unos minutos. Al terminar el ritual, se sentirá más ligero y con energía renovada . Está listo para comenzar el nuevo año con el pie derecho.",
