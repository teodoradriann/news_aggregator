    "text": "[Cristiano Ronaldo](https://okdiario.com/deportes/yo-estaba-amiga-cristiano-ronaldo-dijo-vamos-casa-tomar-algo-13398929) hizo de nuevo historia en el fútbol anotando el gol número 900 de su carrera deportiva. Este jueves, Portugal se enfrentó a Croacia y el delantero del Al Nassr ayudó a su selección para ganar a los croatas. Después de convertirse en el primer futbolista en conseguirlo, el Real Madrid le felicitó con un emotivo mensaje en redes sociales que emocionó al madridismo. «Otro hito histórico: 900 goles en la carrera profesional de una de las más grandes leyendas del Real Madrid y del fútbol mundial. ¡Felicidades, querido y admirado Cristiano! El Real Madrid y el madridismo siempre orgullosos de ti», comentó el [Real Madrid](https://www.realmadrid.com/es-ES) en sus redes sociales con un mensaje que llenó de nostalgia a millones de madridistas. Este jueves, el portugués anotó el segundo tanto de Portugal en el partido de la Liga de Naciones ante Croacia. El gol, un remate con el pie derecho desde el corazón del área tras asistencia de Nuno Mendes, supone un hito más en la carrera de récord del jugador. El delantero suma 900 goles en 1.238 partidos oficiales, con una media de casi 0,73 tantos por encuentro, que ha marcado con las camisetas de Sporting, donde anotó cinco goles; del Manchester United, anotando 145; del Real Madrid con 450 y convertirse en el máximo goleador de la historia del club blanco; de la Juventus con 101 tantos y del Al-Nassr con 67 hasta la fecha. A su periplo en estos clubes se suman los 131 tantos que ha firmado con la selección de Portugal. La afición lusa recibió el gol de Cristiano con su ya famoso «Siuuu» y coreó el nombre del delantero de Madeira, que para celebrarlo se tiró al suelo en la línea de fondo con las manos en la cara y una sonrisa. Otro hito histórico: 900 goles en la carrera profesional de una de las más grandes leyendas del Real Madrid y del fútbol mundial. ¡Felicidades, querido y admirado [@Cristiano]! El Real Madrid y el madridismo siempre orgullosos de ti. — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadrid) [September 5, 2024] Cristiano Ronaldo quiere más En la previa al partido ante Croacia, Cristiano Ronaldo demostraba su hambre y sus ganas por seguir cumpliendo retos y rompiendo récords: «Eso es todo lo que dice la prensa. Nunca se me pasó por la cabeza que mi ciclo (con Portugal) había terminado. Todo lo contrario: me dio aún más motivación para seguir siendo honesto». «En mi opinión la Eurocopa no fue una decepción, fue parte del crecimiento de un equipo que tiene que tomarse su tiempo. En mi opinión, fue positivo. A nadie le gusta perder, pero para mí no fue un fracaso, creo que fue una victoria», dijo CR7. «Cuando las cosas van bien, es difícil evolucionar, así que aprendemos de ello, en el futbol y en la vida. Hay que saber afrontar los malos momentos con optimismo y ligereza. Así es la vida», añadió.",

As part of this effort, more than 2,00,000 saplings will be planted along four major expressways. Additionally, 100,000 saplings will be planted in the UP Defence Industrial Corridor. The Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) is spearheading this initiative. The Yogi government is also preparing for extensive tree planting along the banks of the under-construction Ganga Expressway. This year, continuing the tradition of past years, more than 36 crore saplings will be planted under the ‘Ped Lagao, Ped Bachao Abhiyan’. According to UPEIDA officials, a budget of over Rs 36 crore is being provided to the Uttar Pradesh Forest department for planting trees on 500 hectares on both sides between the carriageway and service road of the Ganga Expressway, and for their maintenance over the next 10 years. Additionally, as part of the campaign, more than 2,37,000 saplings will be planted on four other expressways managed by UPEIDA. This includes 15,000 saplings on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway, 1,06,000 on Purvanchal Expressway, 25,000 on Bundelkhand Expressway, and 91,600 on Gorakhpur Link Expressway. Furthermore, 1,00,000 plants will be planted in the UP Defence Industrial Corridor. These will include 66,700 saplings of peepal, pakad, banyan, gular, and neem trees, along with a large number of fruit-bearing trees. Under the Ganga Expressway Project, UPEIDA is providing over Rs 16 crore to the Forest department for the Ganga River Dolphin Conservation Plan. Additionally, UPEIDA is giving Rs 5 crore to the Forest department for the revival of the Mala river and the conservation of biodiversity in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve.",

    "title": "Eight ways to overcome waste management crisis | The Business Standard",
    "text": "Humanity generates between 2.1 billion and 2.3 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste a year, according to UN Environment Programme (UNEP). When improperly managed, much of that refuse—from food and plastics to electronics and textiles—emits greenhouse gases or poisonous chemicals. This damages ecosystems, inflicts disease and threatens economic prosperity, disproportionately harming women and youth. On 30 March, the world will mark the International Day of Zero Waste. The observance, led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), highlights the importance of proper waste management. It also focuses on ways to rein in the conspicuous consumption that is feeding the waste crisis. \"Overconsumption is killing us. Humanity needs an intervention,\" says UN Secretary-General António Guterres. \"On this Zero Waste Day, let's pledge to end the destructive cycle of waste, once and for all.\" Here are eight ways to embrace a zero waste approach: 1. Combat food waste Some 19% of food available to consumers is wasted annually despite 783 million people going hungry. Around 8 to 10% of the planet's greenhouse gas emissions come from the production of food that is ultimately squandered. There are lots of ways to turn that tide. Municipalities can promote urban agriculture and use food waste in animal husbandry, farming, green-space maintenance and more. They can also fund food waste composting schemes, segregate food waste at source and ban food from dumpsites. Meanwhile, consumers can buy only what they need, embrace less appealing but perfectly edible fruits and vegetables, store food more wisely, use up leftovers, compost food scraps instead of throwing them away, and donate food before it goes bad, something made easier by a bevy of apps. 2. Take on textile waste Less than 1% of the material used to produce clothing is recycled into new items, resulting in over US$100 billion in annual material value loss. The textiles industry also uses the equivalent of 86 million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water every year. To counter that, the fashion industry needs to become more circular. Brands and retailers can offer more circular business models and products that last longer and can be remade, governments can provide infrastructure for collecting and sorting used textiles, communicators—including influencers and brand managers—can shift fashion's marketing narrative, and consumers can assess if their clothing purchases are necessary. waste \"Zero makes sense on every level,\" says Michal Mlynár, UN-Habitat Acting Executive Director. \"By retaining materials within the economy and enhancing waste management practices, we bring benefits to our economies, our societies, our planet and ourselves.\" 3. Avoid electronic waste Electronics, from computers to phones, are clogging dumpsites around the world as manufacturers continually encourage consumers to purchase brand-new devices. Through robust policymaking, governments can encourage consumers to keep their products for longer while pushing manufacturers to offer repair services, a change that would bring a host of economic benefits. They can also implement extended producer responsibility, a policy that can ensure producers of material goods are responsible for the management and treatment of waste. This can keep raw materials and goods in the economic cycle and inspire consumer waste prevention, eco-design, and optimization of waste collection. \"As the world drowns in waste, humanity must act,\" says Sheila Aggarwal-Khan, Director of UNEP's Industry and Economy Division. \"We have the solutions to solve the waste pollution crisis. We just need commitment, collaboration and investment from governments, businesses and individuals to implement them.\" 4. Reduce resource use in products Raw material use has more than tripled over the last 50 years, driving the destruction of natural spaces and fueling the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. Producers can follow nationally determined eco-design standards to reduce energy and resource use while minimizing hazardous chemicals in production. These standards also ensure products are durable, repairable and recyclable while use. This should be part of a larger effort to design products through what is known as the lifecycle approach. This entails reducing resource use and emissions to the environment throughout all stages of a product's life, from production to recycling. 5. Crack down on plastic pollution Plastics are commonly used in electronics, textiles and single-use products. Some 85% of single-use plastic bottles, containers and packaging end up in landfills or are mismanaged. Because plastic does not biodegrade, it contributes to major health impacts as microplastics infiltrate food and water sources. In addition to phasing out single-use plastics and improving waste management, establishing a global monitoring and reporting system can help end plastic pollution. 6. Take on hazardous waste Chemicals are prevalent in daily life – electronics can contain mercury, cosmetics may have lead and cleaning supplies often have persistent organic pollutants. Chemical and hazardous waste require specialized treatment and disposal, yet some governments fail to meet standards set in the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) conventions. Hazardous chemicals and waste cross borders, unauthorized or even illegally. Governments can commit to multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), like the BRS conventions, which institutionalize intergovernmental and cross-sectoral cooperation through binding targets and action plans. Citizens can educate themselves about substances and waste types that are restricted or banned under the MEAs and demand that governments and industries remove them from the global market. 7. Rethink how cities are designed and managed By 2050, 68% of the world is expected to live in cities. Investing in energy-efficient buildings leads to long-term reductions in construction and demolition, which generate significant amounts of waste and account for 37% of greenhouse gas emissions. 8. Bolster waste management through investment and training Globally, around 25% of waste is left uncollected, while 39% is not managed in controlled facilities. Global waste management incurs a total net cost of $361 billion annually. By ending uncontrolled disposal, reducing waste generation, and increasing recycling, governments can generate an annual net gain of$108.1 billion by 2050.",

Aquí te damos más detalles para que te animes a cambiar tus piezas o realzarte tu primer piercing. Perforaciones buenas, bonitas y seguras en CDMX A través de un video de TikTok, La Mala se lanzó otra vez al centro y trajo una nueva recomendación: Yolotl Kupuri, un local que lleva años perforando y tatuando a la banda chilanga. Además de tener una larga carrera de clientes satisfechos, este local tiene la especialidad de tener sus propias piezas de joyería certificadas y modelos únicos gracias a Chalchiucalli, una distribuidora y diseñadora de joyería con inspiración prehispánica. Hay piezas de oro, plata, titanio, acero quirúrgico, minerales y madera; pura calidad para que tu perforación no se te infecte y vayas bien fashion. La encargada de las perforaciones es Andie, profesional del piercing aquí en la CDMX que te atenderá con todas las normas de salubridad y certificado en mano; para que cuentes con la seguridad de que estás con una experta. Lo más chido de Yolotl Kupuri es que aquí puedes realizarte la perforación más básica como la de la ceja, la lengua o el ombligo; hasta la más extrema como la “príncipe Alberto” —si no sabes cuál es, pregúntale a Google—. También puedes encontrar piezas únicas para tu nipple piercing, el septum o un hélix o los snake bites, expansiones totegems, microdermales y, si te animas, hasta tatuajes. Si ya se te antokó, te invitamos a que cheques a estas [7 tatuadoras mexicanas](https://www.chilango.com/agenda/otros/tatuadoras-estilo-mexicano/) antes de elegir qué rayarte en la piel. Cómo llegar y cuánto cuesta Yolotl Kupuri se encuentra sobre Correo Mayor, en el primer piso de una plaza comercial, entre un local de abanicos gigantes y ropa de perrito. Tienen años de experiencia y cumplen con todas las normas de salubridad y certificaciones; además de las piezas únicas que solo encontrarás aquí, pues son diseños con certificaciones de autenticidad. Hay para todos los bolsillos: Puedes preguntar por la promoción de perforarte gratis al elegir una pieza de joyería certificada desde $1,200 o comprar piezas por mayoreo —algunas de acero quirúrgico pueden salirte hasta en un peso—. ¿Te atreves a cambiar de look? Horarios: de lunes a sábado de 11:00 a 17:00 horas Costos: piezas de metal quirúrgico desde $1 y expansiones desde $5; piezas de joyería certificada desde $1,200 Dónde: Primer piso de Calle del Correo Mayor 12, Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México",
