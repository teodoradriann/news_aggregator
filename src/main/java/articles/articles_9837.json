    "text": "According to the IMD, 15.1mm rainfall is the long period average for the month of October. By: Express News Service New Delhi | November 1, 2024 11:48 IST 2 min read As per IMD records from 1901, the highest-ever average day temperature for October was recorded in 1951 at 36.2 degrees Celsius. The highest-ever average night temperature was 22.3 degrees Celsius in 1915 and 1951. This year October ended without its typical chill. A lookback at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data from 1901 reveal that, this year Delhi reported the warmest October in 73 years.\nThe monthly maximum and minimum averages over Safdarjung were recorded as 35.1 degrees Celsius and 21.2 degrees Celsius respectively. This is the fourth highest monthly day temperature and the sixth highest monthly night temperature in October recorded since 1901.\nAs per IMD records from 1901, the highest-ever average day temperature for October was recorded in 1951 at 36.2 degrees Celsius. The highest-ever average night temperature was 22.3 degrees Celsius in 1915 and 1951.\nAdvertisement The other warm years were in 1907 with the average maximum settling at 35.5 degrees Celsius.\nOctober 1930 and 1938 recorded an average maximum temperature at 35 degree Celsius. In 1941 a record-breaking average maximum of 35.8 degree Celsius was reported. Further in a decade, this record was again broken with the year 1951 reporting an even higher monthly maximum temperature at 36.2 degree Celsius.\nThe nights were also warm for the year as a monthly minimum of 22.3 degrees Celsius (highest in 1901-2024) were recorded in October 1951. Earlier in October 1915 similar night time temperatures had been observed and the average minimum settled at 22.3 degrees Celsius.\nThe only other years with monthly minimum temperature close to this were observed in 1927 and 1928 at 21.5 degree Celsius and 22.1 degreesCelsius.\nAdvertisement No rainy day: IMD According to the IMD, 15.1mm rainfall is the long period average for the month of October. However, there have been no rainy days observed in Delhi so far, which has also contributed to the above-normal temperatures. Rainy days additionally help in dispersal of pollutants.\nWith the onset of winter, the air quality starts to worsen in the capital. Meteorological conditions such as high temperatures can also help aid dispersal of pollutants.",

    "text": "VATICAN CITY - Doctors have changed treatment for Pope Francis' respiratory tract infection to tackle a \"complex clinical situation\" and he will remain in hospital for as long as necessary, the Vatican said on Monday.\n\"The results of the tests carried out in recent days and today have demonstrated a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract, which has led to a further modification of the therapy,\" said a brief statement.\n\"All tests conducted up to today are indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require an appropriate hospital stay,\" it said.\nThe 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday.\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pontiff was \"in good spirits\". He did not specify whether the pope was suffering from a bacterial or viral infection, but said a further update on the pope's condition would be issued later on Monday.\nWhile a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics, viral infections cannot. Viruses usually have to run their course, but the patient can be assisted with other medicines to bring down their fever or help their body fight the infection.\nA polymicrobial infection is one caused by two or more micro-organisms, and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.\nThe Vatican said on Monday that the pope's planned weekly audience in St. Peter's Square, set for Wednesday, had been cancelled \"due to the continued hospitalization of the Holy Father\".\nThe pope's doctors had earlier ordered complete rest, and Francis was unable to deliver his regular weekly prayer on Sunday to pilgrims in St Peter's Square or lead a special Mass for artists to mark the Catholic Church's Jubilee Year.\n'QUITE WORRIED' BY POPE'S ABSENCE\nPilgrims visiting the Vatican on Monday offered their hopes that Francis would recover soon.\n\"We certainly wish for him to get better very quickly,\" said Rev. Tyler Carter, a Catholic priest from the United States. \"He is our father and our shepherd, and so we want his continued health and blessing.\"\nManuel Rossi, a tourist from Milan, Italy, said he was \"quite worried\" when the pope cancelled his appearance on Sunday.\n\"I am 18 years old so I have seen few popes in my life, and am very close to him,\" said Rossi. \"I hope he recovers as soon as possible.\"\nWhile in hospital over the weekend, the pope continued his recent practice of making phone calls to speak with members of a Catholic parish in Gaza, Italian broadcaster Mediaset reported on Monday.\nOne of the parish members said Francis had called on both Friday and Saturday and was in \"good spirits\" but sounded \"a bit tired\".\n\"Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you accompany me in these days,\" the pope wrote on X on Sunday.

O periódico publicou uma matéria que sugere que a empresa de Cupertino pode enfrentar uma disputa ainda mais brutal após o lançamento do Huawei Mate 70, que contará com um chip de alto desempenho.\nClique e siga o Canaltech no WhatsAppNovo celular com IA da LG pode ser fabricado pela SamsungHuawei está pronta para lançar novo celular dobrável; veja detalhes\nA fabricante chinesa ainda não revelou muitos detalhes sobre o desenvolvimento, mas o chipset Kirin que usará arquitetura de 6 nanômetros e deve alimentar a linha Mate 70 pode trazer vários avanços em desempenho e eficiência energética, dificultando ainda mais os planos de crescimento da Maçã no mercado chinês.\nApesar de não liderar o mercado, a Apple conseguia se virar bastante no país e tinha uma boa participação na China até o ano passado. Porém, a Huawei voltou a ganhar mais espaço nos últimos meses e disparou à frente de sua principal adversária no universo mobile.\nAlém do desempenho energético promissor do chip Kirin adotado para o Mate 70, há outros aspectos que podem ajudar a Huawei a se distanciar mais da Apple na China. Um deles é que a marca chinesa já possui celulares com ferramentas de inteligência artificial ativadas e o Mate 70 deve seguir essa mesma trilha. A empresa de Tim Cook, por outro lado, deve ativar o Apple Intelligence na China apenas no próximo ano.\nPor fim, é importante frisar, também, que assim como a Huawei sofre restrições e proibições no mercado ocidental por conta de sanções norte-americanas — que já ocorrem há pelo menos 5 anos — a Apple também tem algumas limitações na China. Autoridades locais já instruíram as empresas a proibirem produtos da marca.\nApple perde espaço no mercado de celulares e Huawei decola na ChinaHuawei rouba mercado da Apple na China e receita dispara\nAlém disso, há relatos de que o país também estaria levantando fundos para ajudar a fabricante a construir mais lojas e investir no setor de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento.\nFonte: Wall Street Journal via Huawei Central",

    "text": "Debut Under Pressure\nRoki Sasaki stepped onto the mound in his Major League debut amidst palpable expectations and intense atmosphere. In a game that ended 6-3, he delivered a performance marked by composure and determination, pitching three innings and limiting the opposing team to just one earned run. His commanding debut helped secure an early victory for his team, setting a promising tone for the season.\nChanneling Nerves into Focus\nDespite experiencing nerves, Sasaki transformed his apprehension into a driving force for concentration. He openly acknowledged that the pressure of not only launching his MLB career but also returning to pitch near his hometown enriched the moment. His ability to channel these emotions allowed him to execute critical plays, including two strikeouts in high-pressure, bases-loaded situations during the third inning.\nA Glimpse of Future Greatness\nSasaki’s performance was a balanced display of control and potential. Although he issued five walks over 56 pitches, his three strikeouts and overall command of the game hinted at an even greater level of skill yet to come. His willingness to embrace the moment and turn early season nerves into energy underscored a commitment to expanding his role on the team. The debut served not only as a personal milestone but also as an indicator of the bright future ahead in Major League Baseball.",
