    "title": "Roman Wilson injury update: Pittsburgh Steelers get good news on rookie WR",
    "text": "By Mike Moraitis ,\n1 hours ago\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers need all the help they can get on the offensive side of the ball after a slow start to the season, and they may get at least one reinforcement in Week 3.\nAccording to the team's injury report on Thursday , rookie wide receiver Roman Wilson logged a full practice, which was an upgrade from Wednesday when he was limited. This is the second full practice for Wilson since the season began.\nOf course, we know the full practice doesn't guarantee that Wilson will play, as he logged one full session on Thursday last week before he was limited on Friday and was ultimately ruled out. Fingers crossed that won't be the case this time, though.\nWilson suffered an ankle injury in late July, which forced him to miss a ton of training camp, all of the preseason and the first two games of the regular season.\nBefore suffering the injury, Wilson appeared to be making inroads to landing himself a role early on in the season, as he was having a strong camp. However, he's unlikely to do much if he does make his debut in Week 3, as he's missed a ton of practice time.\nThe hope is that Wilson will eventually take the slot role, a job that currently belongs to Calvin Austin, who isn't doing much to secure it. In fairness to Austin, nobody on the Steelers is doing much through the air, and his snaps have been limited with the Steelers utilizing multiple tight ends often.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Casais católicos do mesmo sexo não devem receber bênçãos em grande parte da África Os católicos conservadores têm condenado a declaração do Vaticano de duas semanas atrás, que foi aprovada pelo papa Francisco O casal católico nigeriano Jane e Lucy tem pouca esperança de que sua paróquia local abençoe a união em breve, pois os padres conservadores de toda a África decidiram ignorar uma [decisão histórica do Vaticano que permite bênçãos a casais do mesmo sexo](https://www.terra.com.br/nos/vaticano-aprova-bencaos-para-casais-do-mesmo-sexo-sob-certas-condicoes,dc1baff643dd3623b48b7994296620b494zww5e6.html). Os católicos conservadores têm condenado a declaração do Vaticano de duas semanas atrás, [que foi aprovada pelo papa Francisco](https://www.terra.com.br/nos/papa-francisco-aprova-bencao-para-casais-do-mesmo-sexo,37181aa9e4c57f46697a29735ea9b9714n8zifsu.html), que permitirá bênçãos para casais do mesmo sexo, desde que não façam parte dos rituais ou liturgias regulares da Igreja. O papa tem rebatido as críticas e o que ele chamou de [posições ideológicas inflexíveis que impedem a Igreja de avançar](https://www.terra.com.br/nos/papa-critica-ideologias-inflexiveis-dias-apos-permitir-bencao-a-pessoas-do-mesmo-sexo,2c7e5cb7cb34bc6fbaa0d0a407d4955fg1zeo382.html). Mas em muitos países africanos, como o mais populoso do continente, a Nigéria, até mesmo ter um relacionamento entre pessoas do mesmo sexo é proibido e muitas vezes punido com longas penas de prisão. Não é uma surpresa que Jane, de 39 anos, que vive com sua parceira há seis anos, não ache que a declaração do Vaticano vá mudar muita coisa. \"Talvez nos próximos 20 anos (ou) nos próximos 30 anos, mas agora será difícil para eles (bispos) simplesmente aceitarem isso\", disse Jane à Reuters no Estado de Benue. Bispos católicos de Angola, Quênia, Nigéria, Malaui, São Tomé e Príncipe, Uganda e Zimbábue estão entre os clérigos que disseram que não abençoarão casais do mesmo sexo, mas argumentaram que o decreto do papa pode ser interpretado como opcional. O padre Patrick Alumunku, da paróquia de Mbora da Igreja Católica St Louis, na capital Abuja, disse que a declaração do Vaticano foi perturbadora para muitos seguidores, mas deve ser vista como um movimento em direção à inclusão de todos os filhos de Deus. Ele negou que esse fosse um passo incremental para eventualmente aceitar uniões entre pessoas do mesmo sexo na Igreja. \"Há leis que foram feitas por Deus e pela igreja em 2000 anos que não podem mudar\", disse Alumunku. Para a ativista e avicultora Jane, o fato de a questão estar sendo discutida abertamente é motivo suficiente para considerar a possibilidade de abordar seu padre para obter uma bênção, se sua parceira concordar. \"Acho que ele (o papa Francisco) tentou entender os sentimentos das pessoas que tendem a nascer diferentes ou das pessoas que basicamente estão se tornando os párias desta sociedade\", disse ela.",

    "text": "Attacks by the Houthis are continuing unabated despite the U.S. Central Command reporting multiple strikes to degrade their capabilities. The past few days appear to show an acceleration of the efforts with repeated denials both from CENTCOM and now shipping companies that vessels have been hit.\nThe reports are conflicting but it appears one containership may have been targeted twice in the range of 24 hours or less by the Houthi as they claimed to have “set the vessel ablaze.” CENTCOM, the UK Maritime Trade Organizations, and charterer CMA CGM Group however all denied the vessel in question, the Koi (102,500 dwt / 8,600 TEU) registered in Liberia, was hit.\nThe Houthi reported yesterday the vessel was struck, but in a statement to Bloomberg, CMA CGM denied it and said the vessel had diverted into Djibouti on a medical evacuation. Today, February 1, the vessel was resuming its trip when at midday two anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched by the Houthis CENTCOM reports. UKMTO puts the vessel approximately 57 nautical miles west of Al Hudayah, Yemen saying the “master reported an explosion in the distance.” CENTCOM says the missiles impacted in the water without hitting the ship and there was no damage.\nWhile the ship which was built in 2011 is operating under charter to CMA CGM, the Houthi contended it was heading to Israel. Analysis of the ownership traces the ship to Oceonix Services, a UK-based manager and while ownership is officially in Bermuda, Oceonix is a unit of a fund controlled by the U.S. investment bank JP Morgan Chase. It is the same company that controlled the Marlin Luanda , the tanker on charter to Trafigura that was set on fire last Friday.\nThe hours leading up to the apparent attempt to hit the Koi were busy with CENTCOM reporting multiple strikes in the U.S.-led effort to degrade the Houthis’ capabilities. At 10:30 a.m. local time today, CENTCOM says U.S. forces downed a drone that was over the Red Sea as a threat to shipping. Five hours before that, U.S. forces also took down a drone flying over the Gulf of Aden.\nOvernight the U.S. reports it struck and destroyed what it believed was a Houthi ground control station for its drone activities. They also reported destroying 10 of the one-way drones along with the command center.\nJanuary 31 was equally as busy with the U.S. reporting that the USS Carney downed one anti-ship ballistic missile launched by the Houthi. CENTCOM also acknowledged taking down three Iranian drones which were in the vicinity of the USS Carney . Earlier in the day, U.S. forces also destroyed a surface-to-air missile that they said was prepared to launch from a Houthi-controlled area.\nThis incident followed the reports that late on Monday a Houthi anti-ship cruise missile had gotten within one mile of the USS Gravely . The destroyed reportedly engaged its close-in weapons to finally take down the threat.\nCENTCOM reports it continues to identify and respond to threats as it works to protect the freedom of navigation in the area. The efforts, however, show no signs of abating the attacks with the U.S. now more opening admitting the attacks are being controlled by Iran. Distressed by the continuing attacks and with calls for assistance from the European shipping community, EU defense ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday said they were working on a plan to finalize the launch of an additional EU effort in the Red Sea. Their goal is to launch their mission by mid-February saying they would coordinate with the U.S. but focus on defending shipping.",

    "text": "[Política](/actualidad/politica/) Sumar tilda de \"inaceptable\" el nombramiento de Isabel García al frente del Instituto de las Mujeres: \"No puede estar en manos de quien insulta a personas LGTBI\" Más Madrid también ha criticado el nombramiento Madrid Sumar, socio del Gobierno de coalición, ha tildado este jueves de \"inaceptable\" el nombramiento de Isabel García frente al Instituto de las Mujeres. \"La dirección del Instituto de las Mujeres no puede estar en manos de quien menosprecia e insulta a las mujeres y las personas LGTBI. La libertad es de todas, todos y todes, o no es de nadie\", ha escrito la formación en su cuenta personal de X. Antes, la portavoz de Sumar en materia de feminismo, igualdad y derechos y libertades LGTBI, Elizabeth Duval, también ha arremetido contra el nombramiento al que calificado como \"vergonzoso\". \"Este nombramiento del Ministerio de Igualdad es vergonzoso y envía un mensaje lamentable. El Instituto de las Mujeres no puede estar dirigido por alguien que sostiene la conspiración del borrado de las mujeres y critica la dictadura queer\", ha indicado en redes sociales Duval, que forma parte de la dirección provisional de Sumar hasta la celebración de su asamblea. Duval lo ha señalado junto a una serie de tuits de García en el que criticaba al movimiento queer. La Federación Plataforma Trans y Euforia Familias Trans-Aliadas han pedido este jueves a la ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, que \"revoque\" la designación de la nueva directora del Instituto de las Mujeres y que, en su lugar, \"ponga al frente a una mujer que defienda a todas las mujeres, también las trans\". En este sentido, los colectivos han denunciado que García \"ha mantenido discursos abiertamente transfóbicos y antiderechos trans, durante la tramitación de la Ley Trans\" y han indicado que \"los recortes de derechos trans llevados a cabo por Ayuso, con la derogación de aspectos fundamentales de las leyes trans y LGTBI de la Comunidad de Madrid y los argumentos esgrimidos para ello, están en los mismos marcos ideológicos que defiende Isabel García\". Más Madrid también critica el nombramiento También la portavoz de Más Madrid en la Asamblea de Madrid, Manuela Bergerot, ha cuestionado la designación de la nueva directora del Instituto de las Mujeres, una \"mala decisión\" que les preocupa. \"El Ministerio de Igualdad debe seguir profundizando en los derechos LGTBI y Trans. Más si cabe ahora, cuando gobiernos como el de Madrid los están recortando\", ha trasladado la sucesora de Mónica García a través de la red social 'X', antes conocida como Twitter. Antonelli: ha \"vejado\" a las mujeres trans La senadora de Más Madrid y activista trans, Carla Antonelli, ha reprochado también la elección de Isabel García, que ha \"vejado\" al colectivo, al frente de este departamento adscrito en Igualdad, junto a la etiqueta '#AsíNo'. \"El Instituto de las Mujeres debe de ser para todas y cada una de las mujeres y esta mujer nos ha señalado a las mujeres trans, vejado e insultado: \"Dictadura queer\" / Lobby trans\" / \"Sigues lanzando odio igual que los queer\" / \"Puro delirio queer\" / \"La teoría queer tiene como objetivo perpetuar el patriarcado\", ha lamentado.",

    "title": "Elite: La JL Bourg reste intouchable",
    "text": "La JL Bourg est décidément insatiable ! La réception de Saint-Quentin dans le cadre de la 18eme journée de Betclic Elite a permis aux joueurs de Frédéric Fauthoux de signer une dixième victoire de rang toutes compétitions confondues. Prenant très vite la mesure de leurs adversaire, JeQuan Lewis (19 points, 6 rebonds) ont signé un 17-0 dès le premier quart-temps pour s’envoler au tableau d’affichage et conclure ces dix minutes avec une marge de quinze longueurs. Après cette entame de match à oublier et un 7-0 d’entrée de deuxième quart-temps, Saint-Quentin a essayé de se remettre dans le sens de la marche mais sans revenir à moins de treize longueurs.\nC’est à l’entame du troisième quart-temps que les coéquipiers de Loic Schartz (14 points, 5 rebonds) ont commencé à trouver des solutions et à faire peur au public massé dans les travées d’Ekinox. En effet, le club de l’Aisne a entamé les dix dernières minutes de la rencontre avec seulement dix longueurs de retard. Un écart qui a alors vite fondu pour se réduire à quatre unités. Les Burgiens ont alors mis un coup d’accélérateur pour reprendre un peu d’air avant de finir en boulet de canon pour l’emporter de quinze longueurs (86-71). Une victoire qui permet à la JL Bourg de terminer l’année à la deuxième place du classement, mais avec un match en plus par rapport à Paris et l’ASVEL. Saint-Quentin voit sa série de deux succès consécutifs prendre fin et se retrouve à la sixième position.\nNanterre a eu le dernier mot\nDans le même temps, Nanterre a joué à se faire peur contre Nancy. Si le SLUC, emmené par Shevon Thompson (16 points, 9 rebonds) a d’entrée fait la course en tête, les Franciliens ont repris les commandes grâce à un 12-0. Toutefois, l’écart entre les deux formations n’était que de deux unités au terme du premier quart-temps. Durant les dix minutes menant à la pause, les deux formations n’ont cessé de se tourner autour au niveau du tableau d’affichage, sans qu’aucune d’entre-elles ne prenne plus de six points d’avance. En conséquence, Nanterriens et Nancéiens se sont séparés avec seulement une longueur de différence à la mi-temps.\nLe scenario n’a pas changé au retour sur le parquet du Palais des Sports Maurice-Thorez. Mais Nanterre, porté par Desi Rodriguez (28 points, 12 rebonds) a su mettre le coup de reins nécessaire en fin de troisième quart-temps pour virer en tête de six unités. Avec un écart porté à dix points, les joueurs de Pascal Donnadieu ont sans doute cru avoir fait le plus dur dans cette fin de match. Toutefois, les joueurs du SLUC se sont accrochés pour revenir à un point à l’approche du « money time ». L’incertitude a duré jusqu’au bout mais, malgré le jeu des lancers francs dans les derniers instants, Nancy n’a pas eu le dernier mot. Nanterre l’emporte d’un seul point (89-88) et remonte au cinquième rang du classement quand le SLUC, battu pour la deuxième fois de rang, pointe à la septième place.",
