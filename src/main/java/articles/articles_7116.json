    "text": "Two New York synagogues have been searched by police after bomb threats caused panic on Christmas Eve. Police scoured the Shaare Zion Temple in Brooklyn and Riverdale Jewish Center in the Bronx at around 6.15am Sunday following a 911 call, NYPD told DailyMail.com. The department was unable to share any details about the threats the synagogues received but said they are believed to have been sent via email. 'Officers responded and searched the buildings and found no devices,' an NYPD spokesman said. 'Nothing was found.' Police scoured the Shaare Zion Temple in Brooklyn and Riverdale Jewish Center in the Bronx at around 6.15am Sunday following a 911 call about bomb threats they received on Christmas Eve, NYPD told DailyMail.com. (Pictured: an NYPD patrol car parked outside a Lower East Side synagogue) The department said cops would continue 'canvassing and patrolling' the areas hit by the latest swatting incidents - which is when people call the emergency services about false threats. Hundreds of synagogues across America have been targeted with menacing messages about fake bombs since Hamas slaughtered around 1,200 people in Israel on October 7. Last weekend, a nationwide swatting spree sent threats to almost 200 Jewish institutions in what the FBI believe was part of a coordinated effort by a foreign group. In a confidential memo to partner law enforcement agencies, Assistant FBI Director Cathy Milhoan said: 'At this time, based on similar language and specific email tradecraft used, it appears the perpetrators of these threats are connected. 'Additionally, these threats appear to be originating from outside of the United States.' Between Friday and Saturday last week, 199 swatting incidents and false bomb threats were tracked by the Secure Community Network, a non-profit that informs US Jewish institutions of security and safety. On Monday, the non-profit organization reported that there were 93 swatting incidents in California , 62 in Arizona , 15 in Connecticut, five in Colorado and four in Washington the past 24 hours. Pennsylvania and Mississippi also received false threats this past weekend, while Alabama had six reported on Saturday alone. The SCN said that compared to this time last year, they have logged more than 449 swatting incidents. These occurrences have happened 541 percent more than they did in 2022. The Shir Ami synagogue in Pennsylvania evacuated their Hebrew school on Thursday after a bomb threat. Police and K-9 dogs did not find any evidence of a bomb 'We continue to work in coordination with law enforcement and Jewish security partners to respond to incidents & ensure Jewish communities across North America have the tools and guidance to respond appropriately,' SCN said in a post on X. On Thursday, the Congregation Shir Ami located in Newton, Pennsylvania, was forced to evacuate its Hebrew school after they received bomb threats. The synagogue's executive director received the threat via email as it requested ransom money be dropped off at a location approximately two hours away. 'We evacuated our building, our preschool, and pretty much put our emergency plan into place,' Rabbi Charles Briskin told USA TODAY . Once police inspected the building with explosive detective dogs for about two hours, the evacuation was lifted. Briskin said that this was the first time that their institution ever experienced a threat. 'There seems to be a particular ramp up in the activity over the last several days,' the Rabbi said. He also mentioned that when he received the email, two other colleagues that he was with, from other places, got the same message sent to them.",

    "text": "A barbershop is a sacred place in the Black community — where trust and relationships are formed, and advice is shared between different generations of men. At Queens University in Charlotte this week, conversations took place in a setting that replicated the barbershop experience to provide students an opportunity to discuss sensitive topics and delve into matters of public interest. Students, faculty, and community members gathered in a room as two barbers cut hair in the back. Ryan Byrd, 22, is head of the Queens Black Student Union. He helped set up the event. The setting brought up memories of his first haircut, and he saw it also did for the student sitting next to him. Growing up in Durham, Byrd only let his father and one barber regularly cut his hair. When he started college at Queens, he found a local barber named Dexter Green, who he connected with; he’s willing to wait weeks to see him. “If he’s not able to put me in a slot that week, I won’t get my haircut. It’s just loyalty, and (there's) something beautiful about it,” Byrd said. The barber chair is a safe haven for Byrd. With the support of faculty, Byrd invited Green and another barber to the campus to cut students' hair — and create an environment that puts students at ease and makes it easy to open up, especially for those living far from home looking for connections and mentors. Byrd closed his eyes as Green used a sharp blade on his hairline — a sign of comfort and trust. He said barbershops can be good environments for a range of conversations, including financial ones. “As a place where people learn about economic mobility and learn about how to own a house and be an entrepreneur because most barber shops are small businesses and owned by one individual. It’s the best space to probably have those conversations,” Byrd said. Assistant Dean of Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Engagement, Darryl White, handed out tickets for free haircuts. The university started the annual event taking place during Black History Month in 2020. At the event, a representative from the Police Academy shared the training officers go through to prevent altercations. There was also a retired surgeon talking about surgeries he’s performed on young men caught up in violence, and several other retired men. White said the aim is to connect students with men they can relate to, help them navigate issues young Black men face, and get them to open up about tough subjects. “Probably one of the hardest things for us to really talk about is our mental health because it makes us look weak or makes us feel like we’re just not strong men,” White said. “And I know that some of the older gentlemen in the room are willing to be vulnerable and say, ‘Hey, I’ve struggled with mental health before.’” There were also conversations about civic engagement led by some of the older men in the room, who urged the students to get civically active and vote. Gerald Patton was one of them. He’s a retired probation officer. Patton said he was able to progress in his career because of barbershop talk. He hopes the students will use the event to help navigate obstacles in their lives. “This takes it back to the time period where I grew up,” Patton said. “Where you spent all day in the barbershop, and you were able to hear these stories and grow and make these connections and relationships that will serve you later in life.”",

    "text": "NEW YORK — Donte DiVincenzo has been here before.\nThe ball found DiVincenzo behind the three-point line with the game and series on the line in Game 6 of the Knicks’ first-round playoff series against the Philadelphia 76ers when he uncorked a bomb from downtown to put the Sixers away and punch New York’s ticket to the second round\nThe ball found DiVincenzo again late in regulation of Game 1 of the Knicks’ second-round series against the Indiana Pacers on Monday.\nOnce again, DiVincenzo delivered.\nWith less than a minute left in the fourth quarter and the game tied at 115, Jalen Brunson had the ball in his hands, and DiVincenzo’s defender, Aaron Nesmith cheated over to help Andrew Nembhard defend the Knicks’ All-Star, who drove toward the rim with the game on the line. Brunson got off the ball and trusted his teammate, dishing to DiVincenzo, who hoisted a go-ahead trey from the left wing.\nThe shot fell to give the Knicks a three-point lead with just seconds left in the fourth quarter — and on the next possession, DiVincenzo — the savior on offense — drew a moving screen call on Pacers center Myles Turner.\n Game, Knicks, a 121-117 victory over the Pacers courtesy of two big plays from big-play DiVincenzo.\nJalen Brunson scored 43 points on 14-of-26 shooting from the field, and DiVincenzo added 25 points on five-of-nine shooting from three-point range, no triple more important than the one he used as the nail in the coffin to bury the Pacers on Monday night.\nHis bucket helped the Knicks what was setting up to become an upset Pacers victory at Madison Square Garden before the Knicks — in what’s become typical Knicks fashion — came roaring back in the final period.\nThe Knicks trailed by as many as nine in the fourth period in large part due to the depth of an Indiana Pacers team that deployed a full-court press the large majority of the game.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2024 New York Daily News.
