    "text": "EUA miram fluxo de recursos iranianos para grupo iemenita houthi por ataques Em sua mais recente resposta aos ataques a navios pelo grupo houthi, os Estados Unidos sancionaram nesta quinta-feira um indivíduo e três casas de câmbio acusadas de facilitar o fluxo de assistência financeira iraniana ao movimento iemenita. Duas das casas de câmbio estão sediadas no Iêmen e uma na Turquia, informou o Departamento do Tesouro dos EUA em um comunicado anunciando as novas medidas. \"A ação de hoje ressalta nossa determinação de restringir o fluxo ilícito de fundos para os houthis, que continuam a realizar ataques perigosos contra a navegação internacional e correm o risco de desestabilizar ainda mais a região\", disse o subsecretário do Tesouro para Terrorismo e Inteligência Financeira, Brian Nelson, no comunicado. As sanções congelam todos os ativos nos EUA pertencentes às entidades visadas e, em geral, proíbem que os norte-americanos façam negócios com elas. Os houthis apreenderam ou atacaram com drones e mísseis uma dúzia de navios no Mar Vermelho e no Golfo de Aden desde 19 de novembro. Eles têm como objetivo aumentar os custos internacionais da ofensiva israelense em Gaza, desencadeada pelo ataque a Israel em 7 de outubro pelos militantes do Hamas, que governam o enclave. Navios de guerra norte-americanos, britânicos e franceses abateram drones e mísseis lançados pelos houthis, que controlam grandes áreas do Iêmen capturadas durante anos de guerra civil. O movimento alinhado ao Irã diz que continuará os ataques em resposta ao ataque israelense a Gaza. Os EUA estão liderando uma nova força-tarefa naval para proteger a navegação comercial e acusaram o Irã de fornecer armas, financiamento, direcionamento e outras formas de assistência aos houthis. O Irã nega a alegação. As sanções anunciadas pelo Tesouro nesta quinta-feira foram as mais recentes destinadas a estrangular o fluxo do suposto financiamento iraniano para os houthis.",

    "text": "Netflix has unveiled the teaser trailer for Arcane Season 2, preparing us not only for the return of the series, expected in November 2024, but also for the debut – in the TV series – of a character that League of Legends players know very well: Warwick. With him, Singed also makes his appearance, intent on observing his creature just from the ceilingwhose hunger for blood is kept at bay only by the chains that keep her imprisoned.\nSinged, gifted with extreme intelligence, is an alchemist from Zaun who, due to increasingly extreme experiments, he has completely lost his mind, going so far as to make him create monsters while ignoring any shred of ethics or humanity. Equally fearsome is Warwick, a beast created following experiments that have enhanced every aspect of it. Large in size, this animal resembles a wolf in features and stands out for the flashy machines that pump alchemical fury through its veins.\nBasata su League of Legends, Arcane is a TV series focusing on Vi and Jynx. The first season consists of nine episodes, at the time published in three courts of three episodes each. The particularly mature tones, combined with remarkable characterization of the characters and crazy artistic direction, contributed to its success.\nThe sound component of the first season is also commendable, composed of songs by groups such as Woodkid and Imagine Dragons, which have led the series to be loved even by those who have never felt the slightest interest in League of Legends. Arcane also won an award at The Game Awards 2022, beating out another heavyweight of videogame adaptations such as Cyberpunk Edgerunners, which then did it again at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards.\nSource: ArcaneShow",

    "text": "Lieutenant General Martin Wienen, commander of the Dutch army, stated in an interview with De Telegraaf that the homeland must be prepared for a possible military conflict with\nRussia.\nVainen believes that the Netherlands should follow the example of Finland and the Baltic states, for which preparation is something “natural” because they border\nRussia. “We should not think that our security is guaranteed just because we are 1,500 km away,” he said.\nLieutenant General’s dispute\nRussia understands “only one language – the language of strong armed forces”and the Netherlands must have “sufficient means to deter” a potential adversary.\nOn December 19, Admiral Michel Hoffmann, the chief of staff of the Belgian army, said that “Europe must urgently prepare” for a potential conflict with\nRussia. According to Hoffman, there is no direct threat to Brussels, but there is a risk to the Baltic states and Moldova.\nCzech President Petr Pavel also called\nRussia “number one threat” and stated that European armies were preparing for a possible confrontation with Moscow.\n“All armies are taking this threat seriously, all armies are preparing for the possibility of a high-intensity conflict in Europe,” the Czech leader noted.\nRussian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Pavel’s words by stating that it is not\nRussia that threatens Europeand quite the opposite: the EU, being “a continent controlled by the United States of America”, participates in NATO, “which is moving with all its military might towards our borders”. Russia has warned Finland that it will “suffer first” in a possible conflict with NATO\nThe harsh Russian rhetoric against the Helsinki policy continues\nUS President Joe Biden believes that Vladimir Putin may attack NATO countries after “taking over Ukraine”.\n“If Putin takes over Ukraine, he won’t stop there. It is important to take a long-term view. <...> Putin will attack allies [на САЩ в НАТО]if it continues to advance, it will attack NATO allies,” Biden opined. In response, Putin said that\nRussia has “no resonance, no interest – no geopolitical, no economic, no political, no military interest” in going to war with the countries of The Alliance. Russia has warned Japan not to send air defense missiles to Ukraine\nTokyo changed its arms export laws\nIn November, the bloc’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg outlined two main tasks after the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine: the first is to support Kyivand the second – to prevent the conflict from turning into a full-fledged war between\nRussia and NATO.\n2023-12-28 20:44:40\n#Netherlands #Preparing #war #\nRussia",

    "title": "Trump lawyers move to dismiss Jack Smith 2020 election charges, claim he was unlawfully appointed | Fox News",
    "text": "Lawyers for former President Trump filed a motion on Thursday to dismiss charges related to the 2020 election brought against him by Special Counsel Jack Smith, claiming he was unlawfully appointed, Fox News Digital has learned. Trump lawyers were successful in arguing that Smith was unlawfully appointed in his separate case against the former president related to classified records. JUDGE DISMISSES TRUMP'S FLORIDA CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CASE U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida Aileen Cannon in July granted Trump's request to dismiss the classified records charges, to which he pleaded not guilty, due to the \\\"unlawful appointment and funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith.\\\" Trump attorneys on Thursday filed a motion in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Judge Tanya Chutkan is presiding over the case. \\\"President Donald J. Trump respectfully requests leave to file this proposed motion to dismiss the Superseding Indictment and for injunctive relief—which is timely and, alternatively, supported by good cause—based on violations of the Constitution’s Appointments and Appropriations Clauses,\\\" the filing states. The Appointments Clause says, \\\"Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States be appointed by the President subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, although Congress may vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\\\" Smith, however, was never confirmed by the Senate. TRUMP BLASTS DOJ FOR 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE,' CALLS JACK SMITH CASE A 'SCAM' AFTER JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING \\\"The proposed motion establishes that this unjust case was dead on arrival— unconstitutional even before its inception,\\\" the Trump filing states. Trump lawyers argued that in November 2022, Attorney General Merick Garland \\\"violated the Appointments Clause by naming private-citizen Smith to target President Trump, while President Trump was campaigning to take back the Oval Office from the Attorney General’s boss, without a statutory basis for doing so.\\\" \\\"Garland did so following improper public urging from President Biden to target President Trump, as reported at the time in 2022, and repeated recently by President Biden through his inappropriate instruction to ‘lock him up’ while Smith presses forward with the case unlawfully as the Presidential election rapidly approaches,\\\" the filing states. Trump lawyers were referring to comments made by President Biden this week, in which he said: \\\"we got to lock him up,\\\" Biden said of Trump. However, the president quickly added, \\\"Politically lock him up, lock him out. That’s what we have to do.\\\" But Trump lawyers argued that \\\"everything that Smith did since Attorney General Garland’s appointment, as President Trump continued his leading campaign against President Biden and then Vice President Harris, was unlawful and unconstitutional.\\\" TRUMP ATTORNEYS ARGUE JACK SMITH'S OBSTRUCTION CHARGES BE DISMISSED CITING SUPREME COURT'S 'FISCHER' DECISION Trump attorneys argued that Smith violated the Appropriations Clause, saying he relied on an appropriation \\\"that does not apply in order to take more than $20 million from taxpayers—in addition to Smith improperly relying on more than $16 million in additional funds from other unspecified ‘DOJ components’—for use in wrongfully targeting President Trump and his allies during the height of the campaign season.\\\" Trump attorneys argue that Smith \\\"was not appointed ‘by Law,'\\\" and argue that he \\\"has operated with a blank check by relying on an inapplicable permanent indefinite appropriation that was enacted in connection with a reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act in 1987.\\\" \\\"Smith was not appointed pursuant to that Act, which expired in 1999. The appropriation contemplates the possibility of appointment by some ‘other law,’ but no ‘other law’ authorized Smith’s appointment,\\\" the attorneys continue. \\\"The appropriation also requires that the prosecutor be \\\"independent,\\\" in the very particular, rigorous sense that attorneys appointed pursuant to the defunct Independent Counsel Act were meant to be independent.\\\" They added: \\\"That is not true of Smith’s appointment, either.\\\" \\\"For these reasons, Smith should have never been permitted to access these huge sums of money, and his use of this funding violated the Appropriations Clause,\\\" the filing states. \\\"Based on these violations of the Appointments and Appropriations Clauses, the Superseding Indictment should be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, an injunction against additional spending by Smith is necessary to prevent ongoing irreparable harm and to ensure complete relief for the Appropriations Clause violation.\\\" Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges. A spokesperson for Special Counsel Jack Smith declined to comment when reached by Fox News. Smith has until Halloween, Oct. 31, to file his response. The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts. Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the Supreme Court ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed the allegations against Trump after the high court’s ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the new indictment as well. Trump, in an interview this week with Hugh Hewitt, said he would immediately fire Smith if elected.",
