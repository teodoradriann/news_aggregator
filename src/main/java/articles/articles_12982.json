    "text": "Exposing The Darkness is a reader-supported publication. To support my work, please consider becoming a paid subscriber.\nSubscribe One-time or recurring donations can be made through Ko-Fi :\nBy Frank Bergman June 16, 2025\nA new analysis of official government data from around the world has revealed that excess deaths are skyrocketing in nations with the highest rates of Covid mRNA “vaccination.”\nExcess deaths remain significantly elevated in most Western countries, five years after the pandemic began.\nDr. John Campbell , a medical commentator, is one of the few medical experts asking why.\nCampbell raised the alarm on his YouTube show , analyzing excess death data from Our World in Data for 20 countries.\nHis conclusion: Western nations with high mRNA COVID-19 vaccine usage continue to see unusually high death rates, while countries with lower vaccine uptake or different vaccine strategies are seeing fewer deaths.\n“It’s the end of May 2025, and we’re still seeing excess deaths in most Western countries, but not in Eastern countries,” Campbell said.\n“What could the difference possibly be?”\nAccording to the CDC , “excess deaths” are the number of deaths above what would be expected based on historical trends.\nIn the U.S., from 2020 through early 2025, excess deaths remained at least 10% higher than the pre-pandemic average.\nIn the second half of 2021 through early 2022, they spiked to a shocking 46%.\nHowever, they only started surging after Covid “vaccines” were rolled out for public use in early 2021, and not before.\n“We see excess deaths in the United States a bit above the 10% mark for quite a long period of time,” Campbell said.\n“This is an ongoing issue compared to 2015 to 2019 levels.”\nWestern countries such as Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the U.K. also saw death rates hovering around 10% above normal.\nMeanwhile, Canada and Ireland faced even worse rates at between 10% and 20%.\n“This looks like a huge amount of excess deaths in addition to those lost as a result of the pandemic and the mismanagement and malmanagement during the pandemic,” Campbell said.\nIn South Korea , a heavily vaccinated country, excess deaths exceeded 20% as recently as last year.\nCampbell described this figure as “ horrific.”\nIn contrast, Eastern European countries like Armenia, Georgia, Romania, and Russia have consistently reported below-average death rates since late 2021.\nMany of these nations, notably, did not widely adopt mRNA “vaccines.”\n“This is exactly what we would expect as a result of the pandemic, where vulnerable people for various reasons are no longer with us,” Campbell said.\n“They didn’t have any mRNA vaccine rollout, coincidentally.”\nWhile Campbell acknowledged that correlation does not equal causation, he argued that the global data trends are too consistent to ignore.\n“What is causing this causality may be adjudicated by larger-scale associations.\n“So, do we have large-scale associations consistent between countries?\n“Have we noticed that it’s consistent between countries … where other explanations are unlikely?”\nBacking up his case, Campbell referenced a 2024 study published in BMJ Public Health.\nThe major study analyzed excess deaths across 47 Western nations between 2020 and 2022.\nIt concluded that excess mortality during the pandemic was “substantial,” totaling nearly 3.1 million deaths.\n“This is unprecedented and raises serious concerns,” the paper stated.\nThe study cited COVID-19 infection, lockdown measures, and vaccination programs as likely contributors.\nBut it also admitted how difficult it is to disentangle the causes, pointing to inconsistent death reporting and uncertainty over how to classify Covid-related fatalities.\n“Differentiating between the various causes is challenging,” the authors wrote.\nThey also acknowledged a lack of consensus over when a Covid-infected death should be attributed to the virus.\nAs Slay News has previously reported , deaths were frequently attributed to Covid if a person had been infected with the virus, even if it wasn’t the actual cause of death.\nWATCH:\nCrucially, the BMJ study noted that research has found widespread under-reporting of adverse events , including deaths, following vaccination.\nConcerns about mRNA vaccine safety remain unresolved in parts of the medical community.\nIn support of that concern, another 2024 study in Scientific Reports found that in seven Athens hospitals during 2022, nearly half of the deaths recorded as COVID-19 deaths were actually unrelated to the virus.\n“Consensus is lacking in the medical community regarding concerns that mRNA vaccines might cause more harm than initially forecasted,” the BMJ paper warned.\nThe numbers don’t lie.\nExcess deaths are still running well above average in many Western nations that aggressively pushed mRNA “vaccines.”\nMeanwhile, countries that steered away from those vaccines, or took different approaches, are seeing fewer deaths today.\nDr. Campbell isn’t making wild claims.\nHe’s asking questions backed by data and calling for answers that health authorities have so far failed to deliver.\n“This is an important first step for future health crisis policy decision-making,” the BMJ authors wrote.\nWhether governments will take that step, or continue to deny what the data shows, is still an open question.\nSource: slaynews.com\nShare\nSubscribe Related articles:\nEdward Dowd: “Something HORRIBLE Is Going On but No One Wants To Talk About It” Lioness of Judah Ministry · January 16, 2024 Read

    "text": "近日，资阳高新区松涛镇金滩村油菜花进入盛花期，沱江两岸金黄色的油菜花与正在加紧建设的成达万高铁资阳沱江特大桥，构成美丽的春天画卷。 资阳观察 吴昊江 摄\n□四川日报全媒体记者 田姣 3月10日，在资阳临空经济区，四川仕净新能源科技有限公司厂务部经理熊家亮在为项目设备进场做准备。该公司投建的四川仕净高效\n太阳能电池片生产制造基地项目，计划3月27日完成设备安装和调试，3月28日实现首片电池切片下线。 这是资阳市建市以来引进落地的首个百亿级制造业项目，也是资阳布局光伏产业清洁能源方面的“链主”项目。以该项目为牵引，一场围绕清洁能源的产业“裂变”正在资阳发生。 此前，资阳发布《美丽资阳建设规划（2024—2035年）》（以下简称《规划》），明确六大任务，“发展绿色低碳产业，激活‘资阳智造’美丽经济”被排在首位。3月5日，资阳市政府举行新闻发布会，围绕上述规划进行解读，“‘资阳智造’美丽经济”轮廓愈加清晰。经济何以“美丽”？以绿色低碳产业为发展动能换挡 “绿色发展不是选择题，而是必答题！”资阳市生态环境局局长罗文介绍，《规划》提出以“成渝门户临空城，蜀中美丽新资阳”为目标，分近期（2027年）、中期（2030年）和中远期（2035年）三个阶段，全面系统地绘制出了美丽资阳建设的路线图和施工图。其中，“资阳智造”作为激活“美丽经济”的核心引擎成为焦点。 在多位受访人士看来，这一任务既立足产业根基，更瞄准发展所需。 先看产业根基。资阳市经济和信息化局相关负责人介绍，资阳工业起步较早，在轨道交通、食品轻纺等产业有一定的发展基础，近年来，该市又聚焦核心技术创新，不断推动交通装备、医疗器械、电子信息、食品轻纺等优势产业提档升级发展，绿色低碳产业体系初步形成。 中车资阳机车有限公司的成功转型就是典型案例。作为新能源轨道交通装备领域的先行者，该公司今年1月成功中标甘肃省新能源机车首单。此外，去年2月，现代商用汽车（中国）有限公司的首批100辆氢燃料电池轻卡正式下线，交付广州投入示范运营，也为资阳交通装备产业向“绿”而行增添动力。 即将投入生产的四川仕净高效太阳能电池片生产制造基地项目，更是为资阳清洁能源发展打开想象空间。 “发展清洁能源产业，我们有基础有条件。”资阳市经济和信息化局相关负责人介绍，从资源禀赋来说，资阳天然气资源丰富，安岳和雁江气田储量大、气质好、产量高，已形成常规天然气、页岩气双轮驱动格局；从转化利用看，川投集团资阳燃气电站、中石油安岳天然气净化有限公司等建成投用，西南油气田安岳第二净化厂等正加快建设，去年清洁能源产业规上工业增加值同比增长27.3%。 在新的发展要求下，加快完善绿色低碳产业体系也是资阳的必要之策。“当前，资阳的产业发展存在层次不高、结构不优、缺乏大企业带动等问题，面临着转型升级和创新驱动能力不足、环境容量和节能减排空间不足等压力。”在罗文看来，资阳亟需推动产业智能化、绿色化、融合化发展，实现发展动能换挡。“智造”如何发力？把“链式思维”融入产业发展全过程 激活“资阳智造”美丽经济，具体如何做？新闻发布会明确重点：以成渝地区双城经济圈建设为契机，推动产业智能化、绿色化、融合化发展，重点发展智能制造、医疗器械、清洁能源等，让绿色发展成为资阳经济增长的新动力。 绿色产业链继续延伸。3月10日，资阳临空经济区智能制造产业园（清泉片区），记者在四川越海科技有限公司一楼的测试区看到，数十台外形大小不一的机器人产品正在算法和编程的指令下，进行工业和楼宇服务场景的模拟测试。 围绕绿色、低碳、可持续发展和临空特色布局绿色产业，是资阳临空经济区的发展重点。资阳市临空经济服务中心主任寇含锦告诉记者，该区重点引进商业航天、新能源、智能两轮车、机器人等领域先进制造企业，“2025年拟新招引新兴产业企业30余户，与现有的星河动力、仕净科技、Keeway等知名企业共同构建绿色产业链，形成新兴绿色产业极核。” 在资阳医疗器械产业方面，“绿”的底色也日渐鲜明。资阳高新区相关负责人表示，该区将加强“中国牙谷”医疗器械产业生态建设，加速医疗器械产业基础高级化、产业链现代化，实现医疗器械产业高质量发展。 清洁能源全产业链建设也将提速。资阳市经济和信息化局相关负责人表示，一方面要立足天然气资源禀赋，加大清洁能源开发力度，协同建设川渝千亿方天然气基地，为全省能源结构调整提供有力支撑；另一方面要完善天然气利用基础设施建设，健全天然气输配保障体系，增强储气调峰能力，规划布局一批LNG、CNG接收站，协同打造百亿级西南地区储气调峰基地，保障天然气稳定供应、提高能源安全。 从智能制造车间到光伏电池片生产线，从天然气田到“中国牙谷”，资阳正以“美丽经济”重塑产业版图。未来，资阳将围绕医药健康、装备制造等特色优势产业和战略性新兴产业，把“链式思维”融入产业发展全过程，前瞻布局未来产业，加速构建以新型工业化为主导的现代化产业体系。\nVIP课程推荐\nAPP专享直播\n热门推荐\n收起24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance）",

    "title": "Fedez e Chiara Ferragni: le ragioni della fine di un amore di plastica - Panorama",
    "text": "L’unica domanda che ora possiamo farci è: ma davvero avevate creduto alla favola? La proposta di matrimonio in ginocchio all’Arena di Verona, naturalmente in live. Il matrimonio romantico nella Valle di Noto, tra le rose e il profumo delle zagare (sempre in live solo per i nostri occhi). Il “vissero felici e contenti” condiviso con i milioni di follower: la casa stratosferica a Milano, una vita in vacanza, due bambini stupendi. È tutto normalmente meraviglioso nella vita dei Ferragnez. Le vacanze in montagna nei posti più esclusivi (comunque a Roccaraso certo si stava un po’ stretti, ma non era così male), la serie tv, la passione davanti allo specchio del bagno. Genitori amorevoli (per noi madri perennemente sull’orlo di una crisi di nervi un mistero glorioso), i bambini sommersi di giochi, cani, regali, compleanni da sogno.\nSui social c’è ancora chi dice: «Era la famiglia del Mulino Bianco», ma quale Mulino Bianco, che concetto vintage, eravamo entrati nel sogno mediatico più famoso al mondo. Ma come in ogni favola che si rispetti, poi arriva il lupo. E da rosa tutto diventa nero. Oppure più banalmente è stato sempre e solo un amore di plastica. Gonfiato a dismisura, come il fenicottero fucsia in piscina, per brillare sotto le luci della ribalta. Ma le luci si spengono, gli amici se ne vanno, che inutile recita. Cosa resta? Tate strapagate per intrattenere i pargoli, domestici che raccolgono le cacche dei cani e un gelo come il marmo del pavimento. «La loro storia era più falsa dello scioglipancia di Wanna Marchi», postano. E vai a vedere che magari la Wanna nazionale qualche lardosa l’abbia pure miracolata, chissà. Loro invece sono crollati nel modo più tristo. Lui, come abbiamo appreso, a poche ore dalle nozze, mentre la sposa si sta allacciando il sontuoso abito di pizzo, è in bagno “sotto il lavandino” a telefonare a quella che è la vera donna della sua vita, Angelica Montini, conosciuta e amata ben prima di Chiara. E le dice che manderà tutto all’aria per lei. Come quegli uomini che cinque minuti prima che scocchi il Capodanno si nascondono per sussurrare all’amante che solo poche ore e lasceranno la moglie. Giusto il tempo di digerire lenticchie e cotechino. Se lallero. Fedez, uno di loro.\nUn «circo dell’orrore», lo hanno definito i social. Squallore e macerie, che purtroppo si abbatteranno sui due bambini bellissimi. Ma una cosa è certa: tutti i figli, (proprio tutti) hanno dentro di sé il DNA del Conte di Montecristo. E prima o poi te la fanno pagare. Molto più cara di un Pandorogate.\nChiara ha visto il suo mondo travolto , sbriciolato senza nessuna pietà. «Dopo aver sofferto in silenzio», decide di parlare sui social (ca va sans dire), perché non può più tacere. Indossa di nuovo la vecchia cara tuta grigia della vittima (metaforicamente) e svela al mondo che pensava che il suo fosse un grande amore. Invece era un calesse. Eppure Marracash l’aveva detto chiaro che era «un nano con la sindrome di Napoleone».\nFederico ne esce devastato . Su un uomo che è stato malato di cancro, ha tentato il suicidio, ha vissuto di menzogne come un adolescente, non ci sentiamo di infierire oltre. Qualcosa dentro di lui si è spezzato, ma questo tanti anni fa.\nNeanche su Chiara ci permettiamo di mettere altro carico, ci ha già pensato la vita. Tuttavia, anche se il vittimismo vende più del pane, in versione Lady Diana non convince più. Perché a questo punto nessuno se la sente di credere a uno zuccheroso Truman Show. Ci hanno fatto salire sulla ruota panoramica, la vita da lassù sembrava un bastoncino di zucchero filato, un dolciastro marshmallow. E invece erano tutte corna e chiacchiere.\nQuesta puzza di marcio avvelena anche noi. Tira fuori il peggio, come scrisse quel genio di Pessoa: «Quell’incerta e imponderabile malizia che rende allegro qualsiasi cuore umano di fronte al dolore altrui». Sembra che abbiamo assistito a un’allucinazione collettiva dalle dimensioni paradossali. La cosa più saggia che possiamo fare è vedere se domenica la neve a Roccaraso regge ancora per portare i bambini a fare un giretto sullo slittino, rigorosamente portato da casa. Perché signori, la vita è questa, altro che Mulino Bianco.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#2](c2#c-2) Pasa eso porque los medios privados son exclusivamente de derechas, como buena propiedad de multimillonarios que son.\nY dejarán de usar electricidad para pasar a máquinas de vapor. Puestos a ir para atrás que al menos monten un parque de atracciones steampunk para que los demás podamos ir de turismo.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Luditas: artesanos contra la Revolución Industrial\nhttps://www.muyinteresante.es/historia/59901.html\nYa solo les queda abandonar las millas, las yardas, los pies y las pulgadas y descubrir lo práctico que es el sistema métrico decimal también para longitudes. Que lo de que una pulgada se convierte de 2,54cms, un pie son 12 pulgadas y una yarda 3 pies es algo maravillosamente caótico pero completamente ineficiente.\nNo termino de entender eso de mezclar nacionalismo con ciencia. Sería maravillosamente distópico que en España siguiésemos usando números romanos en matemáticas porque los otros no nos son tan \"naturales\".\nSe han acostumbrado a lo razonable y nadie quiere volver atrás.\nRealmente harían muy bien en medir las distancias en metros y dejarse de chorradas.\nPor cierto, que no es algo muy sabido pero los paises con unidades raras en realidad son miembros del sistema métrico internacional. Así pues un foot tiene de largo 0.3048m exactamente (no hay más decimales pues ésta es la definición)\nO lo que dice\n[#7](c7#c-7) , que da otro número exacto.\n[#15](c15#c-15) Todas sus medidas tienen su conversión a sistema métrico, pero sigue siendo un cachondeo, porque una es más o menos 2,5 y la siguiente que tienen ya pasa a 30. Además, es muy gracioso el ver lo imprecisas que son muchas de las mediciones que usan. Lo mítico es que la altura de las personas la midan en pies y pulgadas: un pie son 30,48cm y una pulgada 2,54cm, con lo que para americanos y británicos 1,72, 1,73 y 1,74 pueden terminar siendo el mismo número (5 pies y 8 pulgadas), con lo que los ves redondeando todo el rato o inventándose cosas como la media pulgada para ser un poco más claros.\n[#16](c16#c-16) luego los americanos son otros que ya tal.. porque aparte de las imperiales tienen sus propias medidas autóctonas, como las de volumen que una onza puede ser diferente si hablan de líquidos diferentes y más cosas\n[#15](c15#c-15) Por supuesto que nadie quiere volver atrás. Es que sólo a un subnormal del culo como Boris Johnson se le podía ocurrir la brillante idea de volver a semejante mierda de sistema.\n[#7](c7#c-7) las yardas hace décadas que nadie las usa, y las pulgadas sólo se usan para cosas puntuales, más por tradición que otra cosa.\nLos pies lo mismo, sólo se usan en cosas muy puntuales, pero igual que los usamos nosotros, con los contenedores marítimos de 20 y 40 pies, y algunos tipos de tubería los medimos en pulgadas\n[#17](c17#c-17) Aguantan más de lo que parece, porque si te paras a pensar la pantalla de los televisiones, monitores y móviles se miden en pulgadas, incluso aquí. Y muchos de los muebles que he visto que vienen de fuera también aparecen en páginas como el Amazon americano con medida en pulgadas y el peso en libras. Y las señales americanas si no me equivoco ponen la distancia en millas, y siempre me ha hecho gracia ver cosas como que una milla son 1760 yardas y 5280 pies porque es difícil de recordar.\nYo siempre lo he visto como un atraso, porque no ofrecen nada más allá de la tradición. En pocas semanas cualquiera se acostumbra a leer que su móvil tiene una pantalla de 15cm y que su tele es de 127 y no le causa ningún trauma.\n[#32](c32#c-32) sí eso sí, pero las pulgadas de la tele y demás nos las comemos por los EEUU, el problema de los americanos es que son muy \"especialitos\" y la mayoría no quiere reconocer que algo de afuera es mejor que lo suyo.\n[#18](c18#c-18) En el caso de norteamerica creo recordar q tenia cierta relevancia. Cuando hicieron la parcelacion del pais usaron esas metricas y pasar el sistema decimal podria llevar a disputas territoriales algo que en un pais donde hay mas armas que personas emmm...\n[#18](c18#c-18) Y nunca he visto dos pantallas de 15 pulgadas que midan lo mismo.\nSupuestamente era el tamaño del tubo antes de meterlo en chasis, pero más bien es una categoría de tamaño.\nIgual que nos contenedores internodales. Los hay normales o del doble de longitud. Y nada más. Que tradicionalmente se miran en pues pues es tradicion, al igual que las velocidades de las embarcaciones en nudos.\nJusto lo estaba leyendo hace un rato:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/27/pint-of-wine-anyone-uk-looks-to-bring-back-silly-measure\nLo importante es que ahora podraá vender el vino en botellas de una pinta (si quisieran y alguien tuviera interés, que parece ser que no)\n[#50](c50#c-50) Claro, \"dame dos pounds de eso\" es \"dame dos libras de eso\", o sea, le das una moneda de 2 pounds por ello.\nPero las onzas?\nEn cualquier caso no es algo que viera habitualmente. En USA usan las onzas hasta para la marihuana. No sé si en algún sitio de UK lo harán también así.\nhttps://www.royalqueenseeds.es/blog-cantidades-de-cannabis-gramo-octavo-cuarto-y-onza-n1199\nYo aquí me pierdo algo. Juraría que en la pérfida albión se sigue pesando en libras, galones, se pesa el body en piedras, las distancias en millas yardas y piés, y demás cosas raras que hacen los british. ¡Si hasta siguen conduciendo por la izquierda!. Y solo hace dos meses de nuestra última visita por aquellos lares.\n[#9](c9#c-9) No es en USA donde se hace así?\nLo de las millas sí que se hace en ambos sitios, pero lo de las onzas, etc, yo diría que es en USA.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Lo curioso es que el origen de conducir por la izquierda puede remontarse a la invencion de la espada y conducir por la derecha tiene origenes peyorativos;\nhttps://blog.terranea.es/por-que-se-conduce-por-la-izquierda/\n[#9](c9#c-9) no, los British tienen un sistema raro. El peso se usa kg, las distancias se hacen en millas y la capacidad en litros o pintas dependiendo de a quien preguntes.",

    "title": "Concejal Sandra Forero destapa las 3 \"mentiras\" que Claudia López dijo sobre las obras de valorización: \"nula o poca ejecución\" - Semana",
    "text": "Hace poco menos de un año, la administración de la exalcaldesa de Bogotá terminó. Sin embargo, desde ese momento se han hecho más sonoras las irregularidades sobre algunos contratos y proyectos que se llevaron a cabo durante su período como mandataria local. Este jueves, la concejal Sandra Forero se refirió a un nuevo escándalo.Esta aseguró en su cuenta oficial de X que hay varias mentiras que López le dijo a Bogotá en las obras de valorización, que han registrado poca ejecución. La primera fue la avenida Santa Bárbara y la Contador, carrera 19 entre calles 127 y 134, además de la misma calle 134 entre carrera séptima y autopista Norte, una obra de valorización de 2018 cuyo contrato fue firmado en 2021.Aseguró que la obra “nunca se hizo, pues la desarticulación entre entidades del distrito, que se vivió en esa administración, era de tal magnitud, que el Acueducto no hizo el colector, obra previa necesaria para comenzar la obra ya contratada, razón por la que el contratista demandó al IDU”.También agregó que hoy no hay contrato en ejecución y que “los reportes de la administración López al Concejo, a entes de control y a la ciudadanía decían que la obra estaba contratada y andando, obra que debió estar terminada en junio/23; la administración López la entregó con 0,55 % de ejecución ”, indicó.El segundo punto que tocó la concejal fueron las obras de valorización de Puente Aranda: “Cobradas en 2018, con contratos firmados entre 2021 y 2022, y que tenían que ser entregados en 2023″, dijo Forero.Así mismo, mencionó que “ Claudia López las entregó sin ningún avance real de la construcción, a enero de 2024 , y con unos empresarios de las zonas industriales desesperados porque llevan años con un impacto sobre sus bodegas y negocios”, detalló.Por último, la concejal aseguró que próximamente contará otros detalles frente a este tema: “ En el próximo (hilo en X) les cuento qué pasó con la entrada noroccidental a Bogotá. La Conejera (Av. Suba-Cota)”, mencionó Sandra Forero.La concejal del Centro Democrático afirmó que la alcaldía de Claudia López habría incurrido en falsedades durante el proceso de empalme con la administración de Carlos Fernando Galán. Según la cabildante, la exalcaldesa mencionó que los proyectos de infraestructura presentaban un déficit de entre 500 mil y 600 mil millones de pesos, pero la cifra real ascendería a 2,2 billones de pesos.Además, la administración de Galán ha señalado que el déficit presupuestal encontrado al asumir el control de la ciudad es significativamente mayor al que había reportado la exalcaldesa, ya que no se habían adquirido todos los terrenos necesarios para llevar a cabo los proyectos de infraestructura. “Si se suman todos los proyectos, el promedio de retrasos en todas estas obras, sobre la línea base, es de dos años. Lo que estamos haciendo es gerenciando y ya hemos entregado algunas obras. El alcalde nos consiguió los recursos faltantes, que en términos generales son de 2 billones de pesos , y nos ha insistido en que no esperemos a terminar las obras completamente para entregarlas, sino que si podemos ir entregando y habilitando, lo hagamos y así lo hemos hecho”, comentó el director del IDU, Orlando Molano, en una reciente entrevista con SEMANA .En este sentido, la concejal Forero también acusa a la exalcaldesa López de haber alterado las fechas reales de los contratos, sustituyéndolas por las fechas contractuales. Según la concejal, esta supuesta modificación también se reflejó en la información que la exalcaldesa proporcionó al Distrito al finalizar su gestión. “En 4 años de Claudia López no hubo gerencia adecuada en las obras, se evidenció desarticulación entre entidades y poca comunicación con los contratistas. Eso desencadenó en un atraso promedio real del 42 % con el que López entregó a Galán”, sostuvo la concejal Forero.",

    "text": "Aerotermina, aislamiento térmico en edificios, luminaria, ventanas, cambio de electrodomésticos... se abre un universo de posibilidades para ahorrar en el consumo energético y además, te pagan por ello. Esa es la esencia del sistema de Certificados de Ahorro Energético (CAEs) que ha llegado a España para quedarse.\nY ahora Iberdrola lanza un plan en el que propone a hogares, pymes, empresas e industrias llevar a cabo actuaciones de eficiencia energética \"con más descuentos de manera directa y automática en la misma factura, a diferencia de las ayudas NextGeneration, gracias a los CAEs\", explica Jon Macazaga , responsable de Smart Services de la energética.\n\"Podemos hacerlo porque en Iberdrola ofrecemos soluciones que reducen el consumo energético, como la aerotermia o el aislamiento de fachadas, y por lo tanto podemos encargarnos de hacer de manera directa toda la tramitación de los CAES. Hemos decidido hacerlo por esta vía porque nuestro objetivo es impulsar la descarbonización y para los clientes es la alternativa más sencilla y económica\", añade.\n[Los hogares españoles pueden conseguir un sobresueldo: así ganas dinero con certificados de ahorro energético] La eléctrica incluye en su oferta de servicios la creación de CAEs directamente en el precio de los productos que generen un ahorro energético, para luego liquidar los CAE generados por la actuación.\nPor ejemplo, en la instalación de una aerotermia, cuyo coste podría ser de entre 12.000 y 14.000 euros, el consumidor obtendría de una rebaja de entre 1.000 y 2.000 euros. Pero la oferta es amplía: también se puede sustituir un vehículo de combustión por uno eléctrico o cambiar la luminaria de un edificio, entre otros.\nCatálogo de actuaciones Los CAEs entraron en funcionamiento en diciembre pasado impulsados por la Directiva de Eficiencia Energética de la UE , y en sólo dos años deberá ser la moneda de cambio de la eficiencia energética.\nEn este nuevo modelo de incentivar el ahorro energético, además de un catálogo oficial de actuaciones, hay que diferenciar entre 'sujeto obligado' , que son las comercializadoras de electricidad, gas y petróleo, un 'sujeto delegado' . Este último es un agente que pueda avalar que se ha hecho lo que se dice que se ha hecho, y el usuario final.\n[Iberdrola se hace con el 100% de Balantia para acelerar la descarbonización de las empresas] Pero para Iberdrola los objetivos de esta normativa son claros, se busca electrificar la economía y descarbonizar.\nPara conocer en detalle las alternativas, se puede consultar ese catálogo de actuaciones en el BOE. Se consideran medidas de eficiencia y tienen por tanto, la contraprestación de los certificados de ahorro, principalmente medidas de mejora del aislamiento térmico , sustitución de ventanas , sistema de climatización ( calefacción, refrigeración y agua caliente sanitaria ). Pero también el cambio de electrodomésticos por modelos con menor consumo de energía.\nPor cada 1 kWh de ahorro se consigue 1 CAE y el usuario final podrá recibir una contraprestación si vende los ahorros obtenidos para su posterior certificación mediante el Sistema de CAE.\nEste sistema lleva ya en marcha varios meses y con él las energéticas irán dejando de contribuir al Fondo Nacional de Eficiencia Energética (FNEE) , donde tienen que pagar una cuota anual para ir sustituyendo una parte de sus pagos por este ahorro energético certificado. Con el que además, los propios consumidores finales serán los que apliquen medidas de ahorro y se beneficiarán en su factura de la luz.\nLista de mejoras para conseguir CAE Aislamiento térmico de un edificio\nRehabilitación de la superficie total de la envolvente térmica (muros, suelos, techos y ventanas).\nClimatización\nSustitución del sistema de climatización por otro más eficiente.\nSustitución o ampliación de la instalación térmica con sistemas de energía solar térmica.\nSustitución de caldera de combustión por una bomba de calor\nRenovación o sustitución de ventanas\nCuando representen hasta un 25 % de la superficie total de la envolvente térmica final.\nRehabilitación\nLa rehabilitación debe afectar simultáneamente a la envolvente y al menos a una de las siguientes instalaciones: calefacción, agua caliente sanitaria (ACS), refrigeración, climatización y/o iluminación.\nElectrodomésticos de alta eficiencia\nFrigorífico, frigorífico-congelador, congelador, lavadoras o lavavajillas. Los electrodomésticos deberán aparecer en la base de datos europea European Product.",
