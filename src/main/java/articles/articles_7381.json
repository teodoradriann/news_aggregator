    "text": "As the world turns its eyes to Paris for the Olympic Games, a transformative shift is under way that will see sustainability take centre stage alongside athletic prowess. The International Olympic Committee has committed to an ambitious sustainability strategy to reduce its direct and indirect emissions. This paves the way for Paris 2024 to be the first climate-positive Olympics, setting a new standard with 100 per cent renewable energy usage and the “reduce, repurpose and re-use” approach that will shape all future Games. At the core of these sustainability efforts, and for the first time, cloud technology will play a pivotal role in measuring and analysing the electricity consumption across all 35 competition venues. Leading this is Alibaba Cloud's Energy Expert platform, an AI-driven sustainability solution that aims to enable more accurate analysis of power consumption at competition venues and enable better-informed power consumption planning for future Olympic Games. Energy Expert is not just another energy management tool; it's a comprehensive platform that brings together diverse datasets to provide actionable insights. By consolidating information on electricity consumption, power demand, venue capacity, competition schedules, and local weather conditions, the IOC can create a holistic view of energy usage. This data is then visualised on an integrated dashboard, offering organisers unprecedented clarity on their energy footprint. The use of Energy Expert at Paris 2024 marks a significant shift in handling Games-related intelligence. Real-time electricity consumption will be gathered from a few chosen competition venues with 100 smart electric meters installed to collect comprehensive datasets. Moreover, electricity data from previous Games, including London 2012, PyeongChang 2018, and Tokyo 2020, will be analysed by Energy Expert. This move towards cloud-based intelligence centralisation and analysis allows for continuous improvement and benchmarking across different editions of the Olympics. Energy Expert's AI-driven capabilities will also extend to temporary exhibition venues during the Games, offering tailored recommendations to optimise energy usage and reduce environmental impact. For example, the main structure from Alibaba Wonder Avenue in the Avenue des Champs-Elysees is constructed from sustainable wooden materials and recyclable steel to cut the carbon footprint. This approach ensures the temporary venues align with Paris 2024's commitment to reduce environmental impact and promote sustainable event management. The potential impact of Energy Expert extends far beyond a single event. Given the massive scale of sports events and the gathering of athletes, officials, and fans from around the world, energy management is imperative for the Olympics and the broader sports industry. At Alibaba Cloud, we've already seen the transformative power of this technology across various sporting events and industries. At the Olympic Esports Week in Singapore, Energy Expert provided critical insights into carbon emissions from temporary construction, helping reduce the carbon footprint through digital alternatives and material reuse. During the Hangzhou Asian Games, an interactive sustainability web application introduced by Alibaba Cloud shows how technology can encourage environmentally responsible behaviour. By rewarding eco-friendly choices with tangible benefits, such as carbon points, the sports industry can foster a culture of sustainability among participants and spectators alike. Energy Expert is even being implemented at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, the Xixi campus. The AI-driven system optimised temperature control and energy usage, cutting off-peak consumption by 30 per cent and reducing annual air-conditioning energy use by 17 per cent. These improvements reduced carbon emissions by 488 tonnes annually and saved 600,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity a year. Globally, the technology is helping more than 3,000 customers measure, analyse, and manage the carbon emissions of their business activities and products. This wide-ranging application demonstrates the versatility and scalability of cloud-based sustainability solutions. Looking to the future, it's clear that the intersection of technology and sustainability will redefine the sporting world. The deployment of Energy Expert at Paris 2024 is just the beginning. We envision a future where AI-driven analytics, cloud-based operations, and green incentives become standard in event management. Imagine a world where organisers have real-time data to optimise energy use, can predict and adjust power consumption based on event schedules, and where the efficiency of every kilowatt is meticulously maximised. This is the future Alibaba Cloud is working towards and we believe Paris 2024 can serve as the catalyst for a new era in sustainable sports management.",

    "title": "Guerra en Ucrania | “Rusia no ganará”, promete Biden a Zelensky",
    "text": "(Washington) Joe Biden prometió el jueves que Rusia “no ganaría” la guerra en Ucrania, durante una visita de Volodymyr Zelensky a la Casa Blanca. Publicado a las 6:52 am Actualizado a las 3:06 pm Camille CAMDESSUS y Aurélia FIN Agencia France-Presse “Rusia no ganará”, lanzó el líder estadounidense desde el Despacho Oval, 39 días antes de las elecciones presidenciales estadounidenses que prometen ser muy reñidas y de las que depende el futuro del apoyo a Kiev. Para “ayudar a Ucrania a ganar esta guerra”, el presidente estadounidense anunció el jueves por la mañana un “aumento de la ayuda en materia de seguridad”, sin mencionar, sin embargo, la luz verde que espera Kiev para lanzar misiles contra Rusia. largo alcance fabricado en EE. UU. Volodymyr Zelensky celebró este anuncio que, según él, promoverá la “victoria” de su país en la guerra librada por Rusia. 8 mil millones Además, Joe Biden pidió que se celebre en Alemania una cumbre de alto nivel con 50 países aliados de Ucrania “para coordinar esfuerzos”. El demócrata de 81 años, uno de los principales artífices del apoyo occidental a Ucrania desde su invasión rusa en febrero de 2022, ha decidido desplegar 8.000 millones de ayuda en total. Joe Biden, que ha renunciado a presentarse a un segundo mandato y que, por tanto, dejará el poder el próximo enero, sigue rompiendo el paquete de 61.000 millones de dólares votado dolorosamente el pasado mes de abril por un Congreso políticamente dividido, con la esperanza de prolongar la ayuda a Ucrania. -término. El jefe de Estado ucraniano será recibido luego por la vicepresidenta y candidata demócrata Kamala Harris, quien promete continuar la política de apoyo al actual presidente. Deben hacer declaraciones a la prensa juntos. “Plan de victoria” Por la mañana, el presidente ucraniano fue recibido en el Congreso por los líderes del Partido Republicano y del Partido Demócrata en el Senado, ambos vestidos con corbatas amarillas y camisas azules, los colores ucranianos. El presidente ucraniano, vestido con un traje negro y caqui, “reveló los puntos principales de su plan de victoria”, según un informe de la reunión, distribuido por su equipo. Sin embargo, no se detuvo ante los periodistas que le preguntaron si se reuniría con el expresidente y candidato republicano a las elecciones Donald Trump, autor de feroces críticas en su contra. Volodymyr Zelensky viene a Washington para presentar este plan un día después del anuncio de Vladimir Putin de una propuesta para cambiar la doctrina sobre el uso de armas nucleares por parte de Moscú. Esto implicaría responder a “la agresión de Rusia por parte de un país no nuclear, pero con la participación o el apoyo de un país nuclear”, lanzó el presidente ruso. “Señal específica” En una nueva advertencia rusa el jueves, el Kremlin subrayó que este cambio de doctrina debe considerarse como una “señal específica” para Occidente. Volodymyr Zelensky advirtió que los ucranianos “nunca” aceptarían un posible acuerdo de paz con Moscú que les “impondrían” las grandes potencias. “Seguimos dando miles de millones de dólares a un hombre que se niega a llegar a un acuerdo, Zelensky”, denunció Donald Trump el miércoles durante un mitin de campaña. “Cada vez que vino a nuestro país se fue con 60 mil millones de dólares, creo que es el mejor vendedor del planeta”, bromeó el expresidente. Se había mencionado una reunión entre Donald Trump, muy crítico con las cantidades desembolsadas por Washington para Kiev, y el líder ucraniano, pero por el momento no se ha materializado. Volodymyr Zelensky tampoco vio al jefe republicano del otro componente del Congreso, la Cámara de Representantes, Mike Johnson. Este fiel aliado del multimillonario republicano denunció un impedimento. Moscú, cuyas tropas han ido avanzando en los últimos meses contra las fuerzas de Kiev, reivindicó el jueves la captura de Ukraïnsk, localidad de la región de Donetsk, en el este de Ucrania. La conquista de Donbass, la cuenca industrial ucraniana que incluye la región de Donetsk, es la “prioridad número uno” del presidente Putin.",

    "title": "Opinion | Pulling U.S. troops out of the Middle East would be a mistake - The Washington Post",
    "text": "After three U.S. service members were killed Sunday in a drone attack on a U.S. outpost in the Jordanian desert called Tower 22, calls for removing U.S. troops from that and other regional bases are growing louder . But abandoning these small, strategic bases would only make the region less stable and the United States less secure. The deaths of these soldiers are tragic. But Americans should understand what they were doing there and why it’s important before calling for pulling up stakes. On Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin attributed the attack , which also wounded more than three dozen soldiers, to the “Axis of Resistance,” a term used to describe a loose conglomeration of Iranian-sponsored militias fighting the United States, Israel and the West at large. After the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel, this group was rebranded as the “Islamic Resistance of Iraq,” with the express purpose of targeting Americans stationed in the region. Austin didn’t talk about Tower 22, where about 350 U.S. personnel are stationed, almost all in noncombat roles. These troops work with Jordanian forces, and Tower 22 supports a U.S. garrison with about 200 soldiers called al-Tanf just over the nearby border with Syria. Both U.S. outposts protect a Syrian refugee camp called Rukban, where approximately 8,000 Syrian civilians have been living for years , otherwise cut off from any assistance. There have been more than 160 attacks on U.S. forces in the region since Oct. 7; more than 30 of those targeted Tower 22 or al-Tanf. Sunday’s was the first deadly one. So why not just bring them all home? In the short term, that would give Iran exactly what it wants: to drive U.S. forces out of the region and dominate a huge swath of territory from Tehran to Beirut. And over the longer term, the United States would be abandoning the mission of Tower 22 and the other U.S. bases there: fighting the Islamic State and protecting civilians. The Syrian rebel groups who work with U.S. troops to hunt Islamic State terrorists in this area would not be able to operate without U.S. support. On Wednesday, I spoke with Col. Farid Al-Qassem , the commander of one of the United States’ partner forces in Syria. He told me that if U.S. troops left, it would be a disaster. “The small footprint of these bases is very important. The main mission is cutting off the supply routes for weapons and fighters for ISIS between Iraq, Syria and Lebanon,” he said. “This is the best way to prevent the resurgence of ISIS in this area.” Tower 22 and al-Tanf are part of a network of small bases that also complicate Iran’s ability to ship weapons and supplies to groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas . Another benefit is that the Syrian civilians living near the bases are protected from the militias and from the regime of Bashar al-Assad. “It’s important to bring visibility to the important humanitarian and security work that’s happening in this area,” Al-Qassem told me. “This is a very strategic area, but nobody is paying attention to it.” The Syrian Emergency Task Force is an American nongovernmental organization that works with the U.S. military and the Syrian rebels to transfer humanitarian aid to Syrian civilians. It depends on Tower 22 as a transit and logistics hub to transfer food, medicine and other basic supplies to Syrian refugees in the Rukban camp, who might otherwise starve. “Tower 22, al-Tanf and other U.S. bases in Syria are being targeted because of their effectiveness in preventing Iran from achieving its expansionist aims and because they support besieged populations like Rukban,” Mouaz Moustafa, the group’s executive director, told me. Austin said the Biden team is planning a response targeted at those who attacked the U.S. troops. He said there are no plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria or Jordan at this time. Meanwhile, lawmakers and commentators are criticizing the administration for not protecting U.S. forces operating in an increasingly tense and unstable Middle East. To be sure, more needs to be done to ensure deployed troops are safe and to deter the militias and their Iranian backers. Keeping small amounts of U.S. troops in strategically important outposts in the Middle East is not the same as fighting a “forever war.” It’s an insurance policy against much worse outcomes. Americans are willing to pay the price of this insurance policy, as long as it does not include the deaths of U.S. troops. The United States has a tendency of trying to abandon its security responsibilities in the Middle East, only to later reverse itself and overcompensate when the situation deteriorates. The last time the U.S. military cut and ran from the Middle East, Islamic State fighters filled the security vacuum and the United States (and dozens of other countries) had to send thousands of troops back to dislodge them. That endless cycle is a recipe for a real forever war. The U.S. soldiers who died at Tower 22 were on a noble and necessary assignment — protecting regional and U.S. security — when they were attacked. Now, it’s the responsibility of the rest of us to ensure their sacrifice is not squandered and their vital mission is not abandoned. - Opinion|Want safer streets?

Entonces al implementar las políticas de vivienda, la doctora Claudia Sheinbaum planteó ‘hay que apoyar a quienes se encuentran en la situación más desventajosa, sin un techo’. Entonces se hizo como aquí se mencionó lo de “Ciudad del Bienestar”, vivienda indígena y se están haciendo las viviendas de para los campamentos de la Montada y esas viviendas para los campamentos de Atlampa”, explicó.

Martí Batres expuso que se entregó vivienda social con una mensualidad a 30 años sin intereses en busca de apoyar a las familias El departamento tiene un costo de 790 mil pesos y tendrá una mensualidad de mil 200 pesos. Cuentan con calentador solar, cisterna pluvial, dispositivos ahorradores de agua en lavabo fregadero y las llaves, “ todo esto quiere decir que viviendas son dignas, son de calidad, son seguras, estructuralmente y son sustentables son ecológicas, están ayudando a la ciudad de México también el desarrollo en los siguientes años”. “Este es un cambio cualitativo de vida, es un salto cualitativo que mejora las condiciones de vida, porque quienes hoy habitan estos departamentos, estas viviendas estaban en campamentos desde hace 30 años”, reveló.

    "text": "Jan 4, 2024, 03:53 PM IST Maintaining healthy hair requires increased blood circulation, so massage your scalp frequently. Using hot water to wash your hair can cause damage to your scalp, which can result in dryness and hair loss. If you overwash your hair, the nourishing natural oils will be lost. We really need those oils during the winter, so it is especially bad. Try extending the time between washes as much as you can. Nothing benefits your hair more in the winter than a good oil massage. In addition to being incredibly relaxing, oil massages are a great way to prevent hair loss in the winter. Drinking enough of water can help you keep your hair healthy by lowering the dryness of your strands and possibly preventing breakage. Maintaining a nutritious diet and making sure you eat enough of certain foods also contribute to healthy hair. It is preferable to let your hair air dry since blow drying causes your hair to lose moisture, increasing the likelihood that it may break. Try to wear a cap or scarf every time you step outside the house to protect your hair from the elements and the damaging effects of cold, windy days.
