    "text": "The uninsured rate in Minnesota has reached an all-time low, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) released on Wednesday.The data shows that in 2023, the percentage of Minnesotans without health insurance fell to 3.8%, which is the lowest reported in the 22 years the survey has been used. Officials note that this means an estimated 11,000 fewer Minnesotans were uninsured in 2023 compared to 2021. The MDH said that the data comes from the Minnesota Health Access Survey, which is meant to track Minnesotans’ health insurance coverage and healthcare access every two years.\"We are encouraged by Minnesota’s overall uninsurance rate,\" said Minnesota Commissioner of Health Dr. Brooke Cunningham in a statement. \"However, we must keep in mind that these rates are dynamic. The state must remain committed to ensuring that Minnesotans eligible for public coverage have it available to them and that those who are no longer eligible for public coverage have affordable private options. What we are seeing is that insurance and health care costs remain a barrier for many Minnesotans.\" The research also shows that lower-income Minnesota residents, Minnesota residents of color and people with group coverage had the largest spike in abstaining from medical care, while uninsured Minnesota residents had the highest rates overall. More information can be found on the MDH Health Economics Program website.",

After it didn't work, the suspect got inside the victim's car but was unable to drive away because the victim had the keys in his pocket, according to investigators. \"His face was all red and he was crying,\" the man told KOMO News. \"His girlfriend asked me what I sprayed with and I sprayed her in the face, too.\" The two suspects, believed to be a man and a woman in their 30s, were arrested as Federal Way police arrived at the scene, KOMO News reported. The suspects face charges of eluding police, carjacking, and hit and run, according Johnson. Moments before the suspects were arrested According to the investigators, two suspects were eluding Kent police in a stolen vehicle driving northbound on Interstate 5. After a short time chasing after the stolen car, Kent police stopped their pursuit due to strict laws in Washington about officers in high-speed chases. Kent police officers reported the suspects hit multiple cars as they were escaping. The suspects lost control of their vehicle and stopped at a rest area off I-5 in Federal Way, nearly 8 miles north of their first encounter with Kent police. The suspects tried to break into three cars while at the rest stop, state investigators said. One of the suspects opened 72-year-old woman's car door, leading to the bear spray encounter. Investigators said none of the victims suffered serious injuries as the suspects tried stealing the cars. \"I never thought something like this would happen to me, you see stuff all the time,\" the woman's son told KOMO News, \"He's lucky I had bear spray otherwise I would have knocked him to the ground.\"",

    "text": "A mob led by radical Islamists on Saturday unleashed an attack on Christians in Pakistan's Punjab province over the allegations of desecration of the Quran that left at least two members from the minority community injured, one of them seriously. The incident took place in Mujahid Colony Sargodha district of Punjab, some 200 km from Lahore in the morning. Police claim to have reached the scene on time to control the situation. Several video clips of the mob attack on the properties of the Christian community are doing rounds on social media. The mob led by radical Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists attacked the Christian community, burning and ransacking their property. According to senior Punjab police officer Asad Ejaz Malhi, a heavy contingent of police has reached Mujahid Colony and dispersed the mob which had surrounded some houses (of Christians) over the allegations of the desecration of the Quran. He said one injured person has been shifted to a hospital and police have been deployed there to maintain law and order. Shoe factory set on fire Another police officer told PTI that on Saturday morning some youth in Mujahid Colony alleged that one Nazir Gill Masih desecrated the Quran. \"Following their allegations, a mob led by the TLP activists marched towards the residence and a factory of Nazir. They set ablaze his shoe factory and his house. They also ransacked a few shops owned by Christians. Before police could reach the spot, the mob lynched and thrashed Nazir,\" he said. However, the police were able to rescue Nazir and shifted him to the hospital where his condition was stated to be critical, the officer said. He said another Christian man also suffered injuries. Ifran Gill, a relative of Nazir, told PTI that his uncle had returned from Dubai after four years. He said some people in the locality accused him falsely of desecration of the Quran. He said the Christian families saved their lives by locking themselves inside their houses when the mob marched towards them. He said the environment has been tense in the area and the Christians are terrified. \"Another Jaranwala style attack on Christians in Sargodha with mob attacking the local community, burning and ransacking property. The failure of the State to take any serious and sincere action against perpetrators of the Jaranwala incident has only emboldened those who exploit religious sentiments for their criminal acts,\" Human rights lawyer and politician Jibran Nasir said on X. Human rights group raises concerns The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it was seriously concerned by the unfolding situation in Sargodha, where the Christian community in Gillwala village is reportedly at grave risk to their lives at the hands of charged mobs. \"There are unconfirmed reports of a man having been allegedly lynched,” the HRCP said on X and asked the Punjab police to immediately restore calm and bring the perpetrators to book while ensuring that the Christian community comes to no further harm. Sara Taseer, daughter of slain Punjab governor Salman Taseer, said: \"The poor Pak Christian community reaches out to me for help when lynchings stir up. Before X was banned, I could alert some groups to help when there was an attack and try to avert the worst. But now they are more cornered than ever.\" Last year at least 24 churches and over 80 houses belonging to Christians in Jaranwala tehsil of Faisalabad district, some 130 km from the provincial capital, were burnt down by a mob over reports that two Christians had desecrated the Quran.

    "text": "One of the Pocatello area's most popular dessert businesses will be closed temporarily but will return following a destructive fire last week. The blaze on Marble Drive north of Chubbuck severely damaged Janna Herron's home as well as her business, Woodland Orchards, known throughout Idaho for its delicious caramel apples. Janna, her husband Cliff and four children have found a duplex to rent while their home is repaired, which could take a year or more. The fire started when wood stove ash reignited in a trash can outside the Herrons' home and quickly spread to the residence and attached Woodland Orchards shop. Herron said the ash had been in a metal container for four days so they thought it was safe to throw out. The fire gutted the Woodland Orchards shop, destroying all of the business' equipment and $3,000 worth of chocolate Herron had just purchased. The flames also spread to the home's garage area and attic. The Herrons have insurance but they don't yet know how much of their losses will be covered. Herron said that even though she doesn't know when her business will be back up and running, she wants to continue paying her hard-working employees. A GoFundMe online fundraiser has been started to help Herron's family and business recover from the devastating fire. Donations can be made at [https://gofund.me/a3d93fc3](https://gofund.me/a3d93fc3). Herron said the blaze has been especially hard on her children. Her youngest kids, ages 10 and 6, lost all their toys due to smoke contamination while her two oldest kids, ages 14 and 17, already had to deal with the loss of much of their school in last year's Highland High School fire and now are trying to cope with the fire that destroyed much of their home. Herron said she's thankful a contractor working nearby spotted the flames on Wednesday morning and alerted her that her house was on fire. She was the only one at home at the time. Herron stated via Facebook, \"I heard someone pounding on our door, and then my power went out. I opened the door wondering what on earth was going on when a contractor in the area had seen the fire and called 911. He said, 'Your house is on fire!' I heard him but didn't quite know what to do. You know when you talk to your kids and tell them if there is ever a fire meet at such and such place... well that went out the window for me and my mind went blank. I ran back inside. Smart, I know, and grabbed my kids' scrapbooks.... I looked at my book shelf and saw all of my parents' scrapbooks and their journals and all the physical things that I had left of them and wanted to grab it all but couldn't. I couldn't go back inside. They wouldn't let me. The fire was in the ceiling by that point.\" It took North Bannock, Fort Hall and Chubbuck firefighters over an hour to get the fire under control. Marble Drive off 2 1/2 Mile Road was shut down for several hours because of the blaze. \"There are definitely no words to describe the minutes waiting for a fire truck to show up while watching your childhood home and current family's home burn,\" Herron stated via Facebook. \"We had so many neighbors that I knew, and some I didn't know reach out to help in any way. Trust me, it's not a good way to meet your neighbors. I have waves of emotions from laughter to crying and all the feelings in between. Can I just tell you, though, that there was a definite moment, while I watched things that I loved and put blood, sweat and tears into burn down. I felt a distinct peace and the words good things can come from bad things that happen, came to mind. I knew it! I have experienced it before and can not help but feel this. It will be a long road and a lot of emotions and feelings will be felt but we will be good...eventually.\" Herron said members of her family's Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ward have also provided help in the fire's aftermath and she's thankful that the blaze did not result in any injuries. \"When they finally let us back into the house, I had in my mind the worst-case scenario,\" Herron wrote. \"We were pleasantly surprised that things were salvageable. I am sure that there is water damage in areas that we can't see, but when I saw the bookshelves with my parents' stuff, it was untouched. As far as my business goes... I don't know. We will figure that out tomorrow and in the days to come. For now, we are closed temporarily, but we will be back. I love what we do and the people I get to meet way too much.\"",

    "title": "Gbaja: An Uncommon Phenomenal Representative - THISDAYLIVE",
    "text": "Phillip Agbese eulogises former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, who recently donated a general hospital and a 484-bed Hall of residence to his constituents in Surulere and alma mater, the University of Lagos in Akoka, respectively. In this piece, I will address him as Gbaja for convenience. The reason is plausible. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila is an uncommon personality who always puts his best foot forward. The story of Gbaja is compelling, one who came, saw, and conquered as far as political leadership in Nigeria is concerned. Indeed, the people of Surulere Federal Constituency were blessed with such an uncommon phenomenon. While he represented them in the National Assembly, he was hallmarked by laudable interventions in critical sectors such as education and health and acts of philanthropy. Recently, a three-storey 80-bed general hospital was inauguted at Iyun in Aralile Community in Surulere. It was a day of joy for all those who converged to witness how a decrepit Primary Health Centre was remodeled into a full-fledged secondary medical facility. It indicated the convergence of leadership and passion. I have always described him as Gbaja since he was elected into the House of Representatives in 2003 at age 40. He was one of the few lawmakers who served in the National Assembly for six consecutive terms. He commanded much respect from his colleagues primarily due to how he articulates his ideas and thoughts each time he speaks on the floor of the House. You are always spellbound, listening with rapt attention is non-negotiable. He was also accessible and did not bicker about airing his opinion on issues of national interest. Some say he is dexterous. They are right; dexterity comes with intelligence. He listens and acts with facts and not hearsay. I wasn’t surprised when the President expressed 100% confidence in his ability to deliver as Chief of Staff. I wondered who would not be at peace when Gbaja was at the table. He comes with loyalty, passion, and commitment. This piece can’t adequately capture Gbaja’s numerous contributions to advancing democracy in Nigeria. He was the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and his tenure marked the era of robust legislative contributions to the country’s growth and development. And it hasn’t stopped. Thank God he has assumed another position of responsibility as the Chief of Staff to the President. The transition from the legislative to the executive is phenomenal. Positives would be derived from his wealth of experience. There are very few Gbajas out there. His is a life of uncommon service. There is nothing about governance in Nigeria that he is not acquainted with. He exudes passion and integrity. Those who know him would attest to these uncommon attributes, hence why Gbaja should be celebrated now and always. We might only comprehend the impact of Gbaja in his constituency once his achievements are reeled out. They are in torrents. There is also another side of Gbaja that recently came to the fore. He never forgets. He is loyal. Recently, he donated a 484-bed space hall of residence to his alma mater, the University of Lagos. At the inauguration, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Tajudeen Abass, gave a vivid account of Gbaja’s personality and what he represents. He said, “I don’t see in this generation any lawmaker that can do as much as Femi Gbajabiamila did for the Nigerian people. I don’t see that person. I say that with a sense of sincerity and honesty. This man has been a high flyer from day one for the past 20 years. He was at the helm of leadership at the National Assembly for an unprecedented 20 years of service to humanity.” This was a profound statement that indicates that Gbaja needs no introduction. His penchant for the development of Nigeria is unrivalled. This is not to say he doesn’t have flaws as a human being. However, without fear or favour, they are negligible because here is a man who stays true to his words and has a high intellectual ability. The President is in good hands. You can accuse him of several things, but not disloyalty. He is not just loyal to the President; he is also committed to Nigeria. It is rare to find such humane individuals who put their interests at the back seat in their endeavours. Such uncommon attributes usually go unnoticed in a clime like ours where greed and unpatriotic acts take centre stage in our daily lives. He is also blunt. You can take his words to the bank—another uncommon attribute. Gbaja is a man of many sides. I recall that while he served as the Minority Whip of the House, and by the end of his second term in office, he had sponsored the highest number of Bills in the National Assembly. Another uncommon feat that shows his brilliance of mind. He remains one of the brightest minds in this generation whose best is yet to be seen. I can only encourage him not to relent in pursuing the Nigeria of our dreams. -Hon Agbese, Deputy Spokesperson of House of Representatives, writes from Abuja.",
