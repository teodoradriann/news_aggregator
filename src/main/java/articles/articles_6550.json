La otra tormenta geomagnética del mes de mayo de este año alcanzó el nivel G5 por lo que en aquella ocasión se lograron más imágenes desde otros pueblos, así como desde muchos otros países en latitudes similares a la de nuestra Isla”, señaló la SAC.\nLa entidad educativa explicó que el evento de la noche del jueves se debió a un notable “flare” o erupción solar que ocurrió el 8 de octubre, alcanzando la Tierra el jueves.\nTecnología Hace 15 horas Tormenta geomagnética podría causar fallas en sistemas de telecomunicaciones Tesla Hace 6 horas Tesla presenta nuevos modelos de autos incluyendo uno completamente autónomo",

    "text": "Saudi Arabia is prioritizing peace and prosperity in its efforts to lead the Middle East towards stability and security amid ongoing geopolitical volatility in the region, the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2024 heard today from Her Royal Highness Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United States of America.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240118880673/en/\nSaudi Ambassador to US says Kingdom prioritizing ‘peace and prosperity’ policies at the World Economic Forum 2024 (Photo: AETOSWire)\n“The Kingdom has not put normalization at the heart of its policy. It’s put peace and prosperity at the heart of its policy,” she said in a session on ‘Saudi Arabia: The Course Ahead’.\nHRH Princess Reema emphasized Saudi Arabia’s focus on the “Palestinian people who deserve a state, sovereignty, and a pathway that is irrevocable. That is how we get security. We carry peace, we carry prosperity, we carry safety, and we deliver it through the Palestinian statehood.”\nIn the same session, His Excellency Adel A. Aljubeir, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Member of the Council of Ministers and Envoy for Climate, spoke of the need to address climate change scientifically, decoupled from emotions and hypocrisy.\n“The world’s appetite for energy is unlimited. The additional increase of energy supplies has to come from non-oil resources,” Aljubeir said, noting that, “We are saying we have a problem, and the problem has to do with climate change. And we need to tackle this problem in a serious, scientific manner. We need to deal with it without emotions, we need to deal with it without trying to score political points.”\nHis Excellency Mohammed Aljadaan, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Finance, emphasized that the Kingdom is determined to double down on what it is doing on its economy because the region and the world need a strong Saudi.\nAljadaan highlighted that the Kingdom’s non-oil GDP is growing, unemployment is at the lowest level, and women's participation in the workforce has already surpassed the target set under the Saudi Vision 2030.\nIn an earlier session on ‘MENA’s Economic Dilemma: Reforms Amid Uncertainty’, His Excellency Faisal F. Alibrahim, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Economy and Planning, described the resilient nature of the region. He said the Middle East “always comes out of challenges as a better version of itself” adding that it has an opportunity to “co-author the future of the global economy”.\nAlibrahim touched on national transformations, highlighting the importance of delivering “consistently with a boldness and a view to collaborate with the world. Vision 2030 is an evolution, a transformation that is taking us to where we want to be as an economy and society.”\nIn the morning, a session on ‘Ocean Regeneration Through Collaborative Innovation’ explored approaches and solutions to environmental challenges.\n*Source: AETOSWire\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240118880673/en/",

    "text": "Les températures dans le pays ont été supérieures de 2,16 degrés Celsius à la moyenne, battant le record de juillet 2023, qui était de 1,91°C au-dessus de la moyenne. Il s'agit du chiffre le plus élevé depuis le début des statistiques en 1898, a déclaré jeudi l'Agence météorologique japonaise (JMA), précisant que les relevés étaient considérablement plus élevés dans l'ensemble du pays. Sur 153 postes d'observation au Japon, 62 ont battu leur record de température moyenne en juillet. Un système de haute pression au-dessus de l'océan Pacifique et l'air chaud du sud qui a enveloppé les parties septentrionales de l'archipel ont contribué à cette situation, a précisé la JMA. Depuis avril, 59 personnes sont mortes des suites de coups de chaleur au Japon, selon l'agence de gestion des catastrophes. Ombrelles et colliers refroidissants sont devenus courants dans les rues, notamment à Tokyo, où Jiro Kan, un artiste de rue de 56 ans a été interviewé par l'AFP dans le quartier touristique d'Asakusa. Après avoir passé deux heures debout ici, je suis tellement en sueur que je peux littéralement essorer ma chemise. Je suis trempé, a-t-il dit. Les personnes habituées à une chaleur plus sèche, comme aux États-Unis, trouvent la chaleur et l'humidité du Japon plus difficiles à supporter, a-t-il ajouté Le mois dernier, le département de Shizuoka, au sud-ouest de Tokyo, a été le premier au Japon à voir le mercure atteindre 40°C cette année, dépassant de loin le seuil de 35°C correspondant à la définition d'une journée extrêmement chaude par les autorités météorologiques. Les vagues de chaleur sont de plus en plus fréquentes dans le monde entier, le dimanche 21 juillet ayant été la journée la plus chaude enregistrée dans l'histoire selon le réseau européen Copernicus.",

    "title": "Missile defence successes in Gulf, Ukraine fuel global urgency to acquire systems",
    "text": "The success of ballistic missile defences facing their first complex, high-stakes combat scenarios in Israel, the Red Sea and Ukraine will encourage militaries globally to invest in the pricey systems, experts say - and intensify missile arms races.\nIran launched as many as 120 intermediate-range ballistic missiles at Israel on April 13, US and Israeli officials say. US SM-3 and Israeli Arrow interceptors destroyed nearly all of them, leaving drones and smaller threats to the Iron Dome system.\nIn previous months, interceptors fired from US Navy destroyers stopped Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles, while in Ukraine, US-made MIM-104 Patriot batteries have shot down advanced Russian Iskander and Khinzal missiles.\nReuters spoke with six experts who said more militaries would look to invest in ballistic missile defence, a potential windfall for companies such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which build those types of systems.\n\"It's undeniable that any wealthy country with the technological wherewithal will continue to invest in missile defence,\" said Ankit Panda of the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a defence and security think tank. \"All of this is a recipe for a conventional arms race.\"\nEuropean countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Poland already operate RTX subsidiary Raytheon's Patriot batteries, the most common Western advanced ballistic missile defence system.\nSaudi Arabia has used its Patriots for years to defend against Houthi attacks; it and the United Arab Emirates also operate the Lockheed Martin Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain have Patriot batteries as well, and Oman has expressed interest in missile defence.\nIn the US, Lockheed Martin in April won a $17.7 billion contract for a next-generation interceptor for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program - designed to shoot down small numbers of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) aimed at the continental United States.\nBut the impact may be most acute in Asia, where China has invested heavily in conventionally armed ballistic missiles. A 2023 Pentagon report said the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force has about 500 DF-26 missiles, designed to accurately strike targets thousands of kilometres away.\nThat puts US and allied bases in Japan and Guam within range of an attack that may only come with 20 to 30 minutes' warning.\n\"In the Pacific, you’ll see further interest in missile defence, which will push the Chinese to build more systems,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. \"Countries will want to acquire (offensive) missiles because they see other countries using them ... That will drive up demand for missile defences.\"\nUS Indo-Pacific Command and China's Ministry of Defence did not respond to requests for comment.\nChina rarely discusses its missile arsenal beyond statements that its forces are meant to preserve peace and are not aimed at any specific country.\nRaytheon did not respond to a request for comment. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson referred questions to the company's first-quarter earnings briefing in late April, in which it said it continued to lead the industry in \"missile defence missions, which, given world events, are becoming more critical than ever\".\nDollar signs\nBallistic missile defence works by spotting an attacking weapon either at launch or in flight, then using a surface-based radar to guide an interceptor to the target.\nInterceptions can occur in the atmosphere or in space, and each domain requires different hardware. For instance, fins won't work outside the atmosphere - interceptors must have small steering rockets to function there.\nThe necessary high-powered computers, far-seeing radars and missiles as large as telephone poles are not cheap, together stretching into the billions. In 2022, for example, the US approved the sale of both Patriots and THAAD systems to Saudi Arabia, in deals worth as much as $5.3 billion.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, wealthier countries such as Japan, Australia and South Korea are prime candidates for missile defence, Lewis said, while nearly every country in Asia is already investing in missiles.\nJapan's defence ministry said the country \"needs to fundamentally and swiftly reinforce its defence capabilities, including integrated air and missile defence\". It said it is investing in improved Patriot missiles, better radars and enhanced naval anti-missile capabilities.\nIn its latest defence budget, South Korea increased funding by 12% for its Korea Air and Missile Defense System to expand it \"from the existing lower-level defence concept,\" the country's defence ministry said in a statement.\n\"Cases such as the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war have reaffirmed the importance of a 'ballistic missile defence system' to respond to increasingly sophisticated missile threats,\" the ministry said.\nIn mid-April, Australia announced a A$500 million ($328 million) contract with Lockheed Martin to deliver its Joint Air Battle Management System for tracking and destroying aircraft and missiles.\nThe cost of a ballistic missile is often much cheaper than the system meant to stop it.\nBut that isn't the right way to consider cost, said Yoji Koda, former commander in chief of Japan's Self-Defense Fleet, and an advocate of stronger missile defences in his country.\n\"In a war economy, the cheaper the better. But sometimes what is necessary, is we need to protect key infrastructure, or key command centres, at any cost. Because without them we would lose.\"\nThe China question\nMost of China's conventionally armed ballistic missiles are designed to hit targets on land.\nBut it also fields steerable warheads meant to hit ships at sea, including the DF-21D and variants of the DF-26, developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.\nSuch anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) had never been used in combat until late 2023, when Houthi forces in Yemen began firing Iranian-made models at ships in the Red Sea.\nBetween November - the first documented use - and April, US Central Command reported at least 85 ASBMs fired in the region, with 20 interceptions and one civilian ship reported sunk.\nCENTCOM has declined to provide specifics about the effectiveness of Iranian ASBMs but has noted missiles posing no threat were not engaged and most that were not intercepted landed harmlessly.\nThe effectiveness of missile defences on land and at sea will catch China's attention, said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the Nuclear Policy Program and Carnegie China.\n\"It raises the possibility that the US and its allies could depend on missile defence significantly against a ballistic missile attack,\" Zhao said.\nAlthough the technical specifics of China's missiles are closely held secrets, the country's heavy investment means they are likely to be more reliable, and are widely believed to use complex countermeasures to complicate interception.\n\"For opponents such as China which have missile stockpiles an order of magnitude larger than that of Russia or Iran and which field more sophisticated systems ... it's not clear that the lessons learned invalidate existing operational constructs,\" said Sidarth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\nBut the political and practical incentives to invest in missile defence will be too attractive for many countries to ignore, Lewis said.\n\"All defence procurement decisions are ultimately about politics,\" he said. \"The politics of this stuff is really simple: do you want to defend the country or not? And the winning answer is always 'Yes'.\"\n 03 May 2024, 03:32 IST",

    "text": "El abogado del expresidente de la Generalitat Carles Puigdemont, Gonzalo Boye, ha asegurado este jueves por la noche que su defendido \"se ha ido a su casa, donde tiene su lugar de trabajo\", tras su regreso, aunque sin precisar si se refiere al domicilio en el que reside desde hace casi 7 años en Bélgica. En declaraciones a TV3 publicadas en su portal y recogidas por Europa Press, el letrado ha dicho que cuando Puigdemont terminó su discurso en Barcelona minutos antes del pleno para investir a Salvador Illa (PSC) presidente de la Generalitat, su defendido se fue a casa \"como hace todo el mundo cuando termina de trabajar\" y, desde ese momento no ha vuelto a hablar con él. Así lo ha expresado a las puertas de la Ciutat de la Justícia, donde ha asistido jurídicamente al segundo de los dos mossos detenidos este mismo jueves en el dispositivo policial para localizar al expresidente, y sobre el que ha dicho que \"ya están tardando en dejar en libertad\" porque no hay ningún delito en el Código Penal que recoja estos hechos. Sobre si el expresidente tiene previsto llegar a un acuerdo con los Mossos d'Esquadra para pactar una detención, Boye ha respondido que Puigdemont \"no se entregará nunca\". \"Ha dicho que vendría a la investidura y yo creo que ha participado de manera clara\", ha dicho sobre la breve visita del expresidente, que ha logrado burlar un dispositivo de seguridad en el que su abogado ha dicho textualmente que hubo nerviosismo y se ha detenido a diestro y siniestro.
