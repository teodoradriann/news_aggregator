    "text": "RICHMOND — The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) on Thursday announced the state’s first reported influenza-associated pediatric death for the 2023-24 flu season. \"Sadly, a child (5-12 years old) in Virginia’s Eastern region died from complications associated with influenza (flu),\" according to a VDH media release. \"To protect the family’s privacy, VDH will not provide any further information regarding this death.\" “We at the Virginia Department of Health, are broken-hearted and extend our sympathies to the family of this child during this difficult time,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton. “Even though the flu is common, it can cause serious illness and even death. I urge everyone who is eligible to receive the flu vaccine to do so not only to protect themselves, but to protect those around them.” VDH recommends taking three actions to prevent the flu: • Everyone six months and older should receive a yearly flu vaccine, consulting your healthcare provider as needed. • Practice good preventive health with hand hygiene (washing your hands regularly with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer), respiratory etiquette (coughing and sneezing into a tissue or the inside of your elbow rather than your open hand), and staying home when you feel sick; and • If you do become sick with the flu, seek healthcare early in your illness if necessary. Antivirals prescribed by a healthcare provider are a treatment option for some patients and can help prevent serious flu complications. Influenza activity is elevated and is expected to increase in Virginia as the weather becomes colder, according to the media release. For the week ending Dec. 23, emergency department and urgent care visits due to flu-like illness are very high (6.9% of total visits), especially among young children and school-aged children (14.7% and 13.2% of visits, respectively). \"The 2023-24 flu season in Virginia is anticipated to be in the typical range of severity,\" the release states. \"However, even typical seasons vary widely and result in illness, hospitalizations, and death. Virginia reported five influenza-associated deaths among children during the 2022-23 flu season.\" Virginia vaccination coverage for flu remains low for children and adults, the release adds. The percent of eligible Virginians reporting receipt of a flu vaccine this season is only 27%. \"With flu activity increasing in Virginia, now is still a good time to get a flu vaccine if you have not already,\" the release states. To locate a seasonal flu vaccine near you, you can visit [www.vaccinate.virginia.gov](http://www.vaccinate.virginia.gov) or contact your local health department. For further information, call 804-864-8141.",

    "text": "Ciudad de México. El Pleno de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN) declaró este jueves inconstitucional que el municipio de Acuña, Coahuila, cobre derechos, como parte de su Ley de Ingresos, por la expedición del permiso de construcción y remodelación de pozos para extraer cualquier hidrocarburo, pues determinó que invade competencias federales.\nEs el segundo municipio de Coahuila en poco más de un mes al que la Corte le prohíbe dicho cobro, pues el 1 de julio pasado invalidó también esa atribución en la Ley de Ingresos del municipio de Castaños.\nDurante la sesión de este jueves, se avaló el proyecto del ministro Juan Luis González Alcántara Carrancá que dio la razón a la controversia constitucional que interpuso el Ejecutivo federal, invalidando así las fracciones XXXI y XXXII, del artículo 22, de la Ley de Ingresos del Municipio de Acuña para el ejercicio fiscal 2024.\n“La Rectoría del Desarrollo Nacional, el control de la exploración y extracción de hidrocarburos, así como la legislación sobre ese tópico corresponde a la competencia federal y, en segundo lugar, porque el ámbito sobre el que legisla el Congreso local se vincula con recursos que se ubican en yacimientos localizados en el subsuelo, siendo que, de conformidad con el artículo 73, fracción XXIX, en relación con el diverso Numeral 27, ambos de la Constitución Federal, corresponde al Poder Legislativo Federal legislar sobre esta materia”, explicó Alcántara Carrancá.\nCon el fallo de la Corte se exhortó también al Congreso del Estado de Coahuila para que, “en lo futuro, se abstenga de incurrir en el mismo vicio de inconstitucionalidad”.",

    "title": "‘God, this is hard.’ Friend of fallen Georgia soldier bids her farewell",
    "text": "Emily Middleton was a close friend of Army Reserve Spc. Kennedy L. Sanders, one of three Georgia reservists killed in an attack on an American outpost in Jordan last weekend. They have known each other since second grade, and Sanders was the maid of honor at Middleton’s wedding. Middleton, 24, spoke to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter and shared, in her own words, what she might now say to Sanders, whom she called “KeKe” or “Munch,” short for “Munchkin,” a nod to Sanders’ diminutive size. President Joe Biden told Sanders’ parents on Tuesday that Sanders was being promoted posthumously to sergeant. Middleton mentioned the outpouring of support for Sanders in their South Georgia hometown of Waycross, where flags fly at half-staff, where Kennedy Sanders Day will be celebrated in June, where the street where Sanders’ family lives will be renamed in the soldier’s honor. The following account, lightly edited for clarity, is from an interview and from Middleton’s own writing. It is Middleton’s message to her fallen friend.\nHey, KeKe,\nI don’t understand why this happened.\nGod, this is hard.\nI can’t wrap my head around this.\nI don’t want to believe this is true.\nI feel like you’re just gonna pop up and be like, “Hey, I’m here.”\nMy heart hurts, Munch. I’ll never get to see your smile again. I’ll never get to see you play with my babies again. I’ll never get to call you for last-minute lunch dates. Your neighbors will never get to hear me honking at you because we were running late. But we were never on time for anything.\nI hope you know how proud we are of you. Life will never be the same.\nI was so glad that God gave Jersei, your baby niece, to your mama because Jersei looks just like you.\nI feel selfish wanting you back.\nSomething that makes it so hard, too, is that all this is worldwide. I have not watched the news. I’ve tried to stay off TikTok.\nCredit: Emily Middleton\nCredit: Emily Middleton\nEverywhere I look, your face is there. It re-starts everything.\nHere in Waycross at Lowe’s, where you worked, they’ve got stuff in your honor. They’ve got signs up for you. McDonald’s had a sign thanking you for your service. Another fast-food place had “Rest in Peace, Sgt. Sanders.”\nEverywhere I go, you’re there.\nYou would not believe how many people supported you and loved you. I mean, all of Waycross. All the love. And not just from your friends.\nI know you would hate being the center of attention. You did not like all eyes on you.\nPeople are putting ribbons on their mailboxes. Yellow ones and purple ones because purple was your favorite color. I know, you would absolutely cringe. But I know you would love it at the same time.\nI’m thinking about the last time I saw you in August, and how I’ll never see you again. But I can still see you that last time when we were at your going-away party, at Cavagnaros, the restaurant. You were holding my newborn daughter, Landree.\nCredit: Emily Middleton\nCredit: Emily Middleton\nNow my oldest girl, Addi, my 5-year-old, is absolutely heartbroken that her KeKe is not coming home from her job. That’s what we always told Addi when you went away, that you had to be at work. But we told her you would come back and we could all pick you up at the airport.\nAddi has slept with your Army bear for the last week. All she can say is, “I don’t want KeKe to go to heaven. I want her to be here to play.”\nMy heart hurts even more that you won’t be here to watch my children and Jersei grow up.\nI am so thankful I got to be in your life and you got to be in mine. You were my person. You were a blessing to me and so many others.\nYou made everyone proud.\nI can’t put into words how much we already miss you. But it’s us forever, Munch, and I will stand on that until I see you again.\nI love you so much,\nEmmylou\nExplore As Georgia military family grieves, President Biden tries to comfort Related Credit: Stephen B.

    "text": "By M. Gessen / The New York Times The world’s most famous university has done the right thing, and this is major news. It shouldn’t be. But less than three months into the second Trump administration, we are surprised by simple dignity. Capitulation would have garnered smaller headlines. On Friday, the Trump administration sent a five-page letter to Harvard accusing the university of failing “to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.” The letter demanded that the university change its governance structure; overhaul its admissions policies; submit to an external audit of the medical school, the School of Public Health, the Divinity School and several other programs that the letter claimed have “egregious records of antisemitism or other bias”; revamp student-discipline procedures; “end support” and withdraw university recognition of several pro-Palestinian student groups and the National Lawyers Guild; and commit to a process of reform running “at least until the end of 2028,” during which the university would submit quarterly reports on its compliance with the government’s demands. In the manner of a racketeer, the letter implied, without quite spelling it out, that if the university failed to comply, it would lose its federal funding. -snip- But the Trump administration pulls funds first and negotiates second, dispensing with the rest of the process. Its first target was Columbia University. When that school acceded to the administration’s demands, it didn’t get its funding back. Instead, the administration is reportedly considering demanding that Columbia agree to direct government oversight; effectively, a takeover of the university. Harvard chose a different response from Columbia’s. On Monday, its lawyers sent a letter to the administration pointing out that the administration was in violation of the law. “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” the letter said. “Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government. Accordingly, Harvard will not accept the government’s terms.” https://www.heraldnet.com/opinion/gssen-harvard-made-only-response-it-could-to-trump-demands-no/",

La víctima se encontraba viajando junto a una acompañante en un [auto ](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/policiales/murieron-2-viajaban-por-la-ruta-perdieron-el-control-del-auto-y-desataron-una-tragedia/)con patente uruguaya, cuando perdió el control y volcó en el kilómetro 135 de la Ruta 11. Horror en Uruguay: una mujer argentina murió tras volcar el auto en el que viajaba Según un reporte de la Policía Caminera local citado por el diario El País, el [auto](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/mundo/murieron-2-iba-por-la-ruta-alcoholizado-se-estrello-contra-un-auto-y-una-mama-y-su-hija-no-soportaron-el-brutal-impacto/), que se desplazaba de oeste a este, “por razones aún por determinar, perdió el control y volcó, quedando en posición normal en el alcantarillado sur”. Además, las mismas fuentes revelaron que la mujer fallecida ocupaba el asiento del acompañante, mientras que la conductora, de 39 años, fue llevada al Centro de Asistencia de la Agrupación Médica de Pando con graves politraumatismos. En el momento del accidente, la mujer viajaba junto a Fabiana (la pareja de su hijo), quien había decidido mudarse de hogar debido a conflictos y denuncias por violencia de género con el padre de sus hijos. “Esto fue el desenlace de una persecución constante a la cual ni siquiera la propia Justicia pudo evitar”, expresó el hijo de la víctima en diálogo con Infobae. “Nadie prestó atención a toda la historia. Ellas habían denunciado por violencia de género a esta persona y él las siguió hostigando al punto que mi pareja se decide mudar, y en el mismo día de la mudanza pasa esto. ¿Por qué? Porque no se han tomado otro tipo de medidas”, sostuvo el hombre. Horror en Uruguay: cómo quedó el auto en el que viajaba Sandra Margarita Posdeley De acuerdo con las imágenes difundidas por los medios uruguayos, el auto quedó en un estado completamente irreconocible luego del fatal accidente. El techo se derrumbó y se partió en dos, mientras que una porción del motor quedó esparcida sobre el césped con el capó abierto, como consecuencia del brusco vuelco experimentado. Además, el interior del rodado quedó irreconocible, en especial debido a que la mayor parte del auto quedó completamente destruido. Se destacaban cables y componentes relacionados con la parte eléctrica del auto, así como el interior de la puerta del lado izquierdo, el cual quedó al descubierto.",

    "text": "Washington, 24 ott. (askanews) – La guerra in Ucraina e il conflitto in Medio Oriente restano materie divisive all’interno dei Paesi del G20. Anche al vertice di Washington nessun comunicato finale ma una dichiarazione della presidenza di turno brasiliana. “Nel contesto del 4° incontro ministeriale dei ministri delle finanze e dei governatori delle banche centrali (FMCBG) del G20, tenutosi a Washington, D.C., il 23 e 24 ottobre 2024 – si legge nella dichiarazione – alcuni membri e altri partecipanti hanno espresso le loro opinioni su Russia e Ucraina e sulla situazione a Gaza. Alcuni membri e altri partecipanti hanno ritenuto che queste questioni abbiano un impatto sull’economia globale e debbano essere trattate nel G20, mentre altri non credono che il G20 sia un forum per discutere di queste questioni. La presidenza brasiliana del G20 condurrà la discussione su queste questioni tra gli sherpa nel mese prossimo in preparazione del vertice dei leader di Rio de Janeiro. Ricordando la dichiarazione dei leader del G20 di Nuova Delhi, il paese presidente ha esortato i membri a rafforzare il loro impegno per il rafforzamento del G20 come piattaforma di cooperazione efficace, basata sul consenso come suo strumento più importante”.",
