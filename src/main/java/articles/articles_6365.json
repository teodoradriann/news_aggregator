    "text": "Royal approval: The Princess of Wales (pictured) used to work in a Jigsaw store One of the Princess of Wales’ favourite labels has enjoyed a much-needed revival as shoppers splash on party dresses. Jigsaw’s parent company Mountain Berg revealed sales climbed to £56.8million in the year to the end of January. This was up from the £47.7million it raked in the year before, when lockdown restrictions were first being lifted. This meant that profits also jumped to £1.9million, a £700,000 boost on the previous year. Jigsaw has featured in the wardrobes of middle-class women for 50 years and is a favourite of Kate, who used to work in a store. But it had been struggling even before the pandemic struck as tough competition in women’s mid-market fashion left the chain nursing losses. And lockdown restrictions meant that Jigsaw was forced to close many of its stores. But since the world has opened back up, the company has pushed ahead with a stronger online offering, forged partnerships with the likes of Next and is seeking locations for new stores. *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-12907533/Party-season-revives-Jigsaw-festive-shoppers-splash-new-dresses.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Linux • Can't Install Logos Bible Software",
    "text": "So far I have tried four different methods for installing Logos. The first two methods are for installing Logos 10; the second two are for Logos 9. I would prefer it if Logos 10 would work, but either one would work. All four methods have been tried three times on my laptop without a virtual machine. First I tried them all on Linux mint with KDE plasma. Second, I tried them all on Fedora. Third, I tried them all again on Linux Mint 22 with Cinnamon 6.2.7. This is the setup I am currently using.\nMethod 1: Installing Logos 10 with Wine.\nSince the Logos website wont give me a download for the installer exe, I downloaded it on my windows machine and sent the exe to my linux computer. I am using Wine 9.0~repack-4build3. I have tried right clicking the launcher and opening with wine. This makes the installer popup with a progress bar for downloading setup files that never makes progress. Then the progress bar goes away and I get the error \"Logos Bible Study requires Windows to be fully updated. Please install system updates.\" According to this forum post, someone else had the same issue:\nviewtopic.php?t=37310\nIt looks like they were able to resolve the issue by using winetricks to set the Windows version to windows 10. They also said to set the renderer to gdi with winetricks. I have done both of these, and still I get the exact same error. I am launching the exe from the winetricks gui. I have tried every combination of renderer, windows 10, windows 11, and 64 bit and 32 bit versions of winetricks. Nothing makes any difference, and I always get the same error.\nMethod 2: Using this GitHub Installer:\nhttps://github.com/ferion11/LogosLinuxInstaller\nI have followed the instructions provided on the github post to the letter. I have installed all dependencies that it listed. I have tried installing it from the command line and via gui. Every time I run this program I get the following error:\n\"Your system is missing xmllint. Please install your distro's xmllint package(s).\nThe following packages are usually necessary: winbind cabextract libjpeg8.\"\nI have therefore run the commands: \"sudo apt install xmllint\" \"sudo apt install winbind\" \"sudo apt install cabextract\" and \"sudo apt install libjpeg8\". Some of these seem to install things, but none of them fix the issue. I always get the same error.\nMethod 3: Installing Logos 9 via PlayOnLinux\nThe application allows me to search for LogosBibleSoftware and install version 9 of the software on my computer. With this method on Linux Mint, while installing the software, I get stick on the installing microsoft fonts screen. I have left it on the screen for multiple hours, but it just is stuck. On Fedora, I am also able to install it with this method. However, when I launch the application it blinks on for a half a second and then crashes with no errors being reported. Therefore, I updated .Net, thinking that this could be the cause; however, that did not fix the issue on Fedora.\nMethod 4: Installing Logos 9 via wine\nLogos has legacy versions of their software to download here:\nhttps://wiki.logos.com/Logos_Downloads_Archive#Current_Supported_Stable_version_of_Logos_.2f_Verbum_.3a\nHowever, when I try to run the program using Wine, using Bottles, using Winetricks (set to all of the combinations mentioned in Method 1), I always get the error:\n\"The Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.7.2 is not installed on this computer. Please run LogosSetup.exe to install the .Net framework.\"\nTherefore, I installed .Net 4.7.2 onto my computer and tried all the above methods again, but they still do not work.\nSo, if anyone has an idea to get any combination of wine version + linux version + logos version that can possibly work to get Logos onto my computer, that would be greatly appreciated. Apparently others have been able to install it, to it is at least possible.",

The two shared a moment after Pittsburgh’s playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens, in which they expressed disappointment that they weren’t able to win a playoff game together. Harris’ future is uncertain, as he’s a pending free agent. Speaking to the media on locker cleanout day on Monday, Freiermuth said he wants Harris to return to the Steelers. “Love seeing him in the Black and Gold, one of my best friends on the team.…\nRead more at\n Steelers Depot",

    "title": "Reforma tributária não prevê taxa de 25% em compra e venda de imóveis, diferentemente do que afirma post",
    "text": "Investigado por: A Gazeta, Correio Braziliense e Programa de Residência Comprova. Enganoso: Postagem engana ao afirmar que negociações envolvendo compra e venda de imóveis serão taxadas em 25% após a implementação da reforma tributária. O texto em discussão no Senado Federal prevê um Imposto sobre Valor Adicionado (IVA) de 15,9% e apenas sobre o lucro recebido por pessoas jurídicas. Conteúdo investigado: [Post](https://projetocomprova.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/00-Conteudo-investigado-A-Governo-Lula.jpg) com foto de Lula (PT) e o texto “O legal é que se você vender seu imóvel, você vai ter que pagar 25% pro seu sócio. Além do aumento de impostos, governo Lula decidiu que 25% de seu imóvel é de propriedade do governo”. Onde foi publicado: TikTok. Conclusão do Comprova: Não é verdade que a reforma tributária preveja imposto de 25% sobre a compra e venda de imóveis no Brasil. A partir da vigência das novas regras tributárias, haverá a incidência do Imposto sobre Valor Adicionado (IVA). O texto atual prevê um IVA de 15,9%, que deverá ser cobrado apenas sobre o lucro recebido por pessoas jurídicas. Como [mostrado pelo Estadão E-Investidor](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/educacao-financeira/reforma-tributaria-aumentar-impostos-lucro-venda-imoveis/?_gl=1*1nss90b*_gcl_au*NzAxMDE5NTkwLjE3MTg3MTQxMjQ.*_ga*MTU4MzMzOTMyNy4xNzIxNjU0NzU2*_ga_H1D7PSZ1DW*MTcyMjQyNDc3Mi45LjEuMTcyMjQyNTg3Ni4zOS4wLjc0NDU5MDkyNQ..), a proposta aprovada na Câmara dos Deputados e em análise no Senado Federal colocou um teto de 26,5% para o novo IVA, que unifica cinco tributos em dois, a CBS (federal) e o IBS (estadual e municipal). A compra e venda de imóveis terá uma alíquota do IVA, mas com desconto de 40% sobre o total, deixando a taxação final em 15,9%. A taxa de 25% citada no vídeo enganoso é uma [estimativa antiga feito pelo setor imobiliário com base em outra versão do texto da reforma tributária](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/educacao-financeira/reforma-tributaria-pode-aumentar-impostos-compra-venda-de-imoveis/) e correspondia à soma da alíquota média de 3% do Imposto sobre a Transmissão de Bens Imóveis (ITBI) com os 22% do IVA proposto anteriormente pelo governo. Em comunicado feito no dia 16 de julho, o Ministério da Fazenda afirmou que as vendas de imóveis por pessoas físicas não serão tributadas pelo novo IVA. Ou seja, nada muda para a pessoa que tem um ou alguns imóveis e deseja vendê-los – como já ocorre hoje –, nem para quem comprar. Serão tributadas apenas as vendas de imóveis novos por empresas (incorporações). Hoje, nas transações imobiliárias, há a cobrança de PIS/Cofins, com alíquota média de 8%, e do ITBI, que varia de 2% a 5%. Esse último continuará sendo cobrado sobre o valor total do imóvel, e não apenas no lucro da venda. O Comprova entrou em contato com o autor da postagem, que não respondeu até a publicação deste texto. [Enganoso](https://projetocomprova.com.br/about/), para o Comprova, é o conteúdo retirado do contexto original e usado em outro de modo que seu significado sofra alterações; que usa dados imprecisos ou que induz a uma interpretação diferente da intenção de seu autor; conteúdo que confunde, com ou sem a intenção deliberada de causar dano. Alcance da publicação: O Comprova investiga os conteúdos suspeitos com maior alcance nas redes sociais. Até o dia 2 de agosto, o post somava mais de 863 mil visualizações, 33,3 mil curtidas, 2,5 mil comentários e 14,9 mil compartilhamentos. Fontes que consultamos: Procuramos por reportagens sobre o impacto da reforma tributária na negociação de imóveis e por outras verificações sobre o tema. Proposta do Ministério da Fazenda para compra e venda de imóveis Conforme o Ministério da Fazenda, [a taxação ocorrerá da seguinte forma para pessoas jurídicas](https://www.gov.br/fazenda/pt-br/canais_atendimento/imprensa/notas-a-imprensa/2024/julho-1/reforma-tributaria-sera-positiva-para-o-setor-imobiliario): a) O imposto incidirá apenas sobre a diferença entre o custo de venda e o valor do terreno (no caso de aquisição de vários imóveis para construção do prédio, será deduzido todo o valor dos imóveis adquiridos para fazer a incorporação). b) Haverá um redutor social de R$ 100 mil sobre o valor tributado, de modo a tornar a tributação progressiva, reduzindo o custo dos imóveis populares. c) A alíquota do imposto incidente sobre esse valor reduzido será reduzida em 40% (ou seja, será de 60% da alíquota padrão), correspondendo a cerca de 15,9%. d) Do valor do imposto calculado sobre a base reduzida será deduzido o montante de todo o imposto pago na aquisição de material de construção e serviços pela incorporadora, ao contrário do que ocorre hoje em que o imposto pago nos materiais de construção e serviços não é recuperado. Ainda segundo o órgao, não haverá nenhum aumento relevante de custos em comparação à tributação atual. A pasta também explicou que, no caso das empresas que tenham como atividade a compra e venda de imóveis (como imobiliárias, por exemplo), a tributação incidirá apenas sobre a diferença do preço de venda e de aquisição de imóveis. Se uma empresa comprar um imóvel por R$ 1 milhão e vender por R$ 1,1 milhão, por exemplo, o imposto incidirá com a alíquota reduzida (15,9%) sobre R$ 100 mil, resultando em um imposto de R$ 15,9 mil. Dessa forma, apenas a margem da empresa será tributada e a empresa ainda poderá recuperar o crédito do imposto incidente em todas as suas despesas administrativas (contador, eletricidade etc.). Por que o Comprova investigou essa publicação: O Comprova monitora conteúdos suspeitos publicados em redes sociais e aplicativos de mensagem sobre políticas públicas, saúde, mudanças climáticas e eleições e abre investigações para aquelas publicações que obtiveram maior alcance e engajamento.

Outras checagens sobre o tema: [Estadão](https://www.estadao.com.br/estadao-verifica/postagem-engana-que-reforma-tributaria-taxou-em-25-operacoes-de-compra-e-venda-de-imoveis/), [UOL](https://noticias.uol.com.br/confere/ultimas-noticias/2024/07/23/falso-reforma-tributaria-25-compra-e-venda-de-imoveis.htm) e [Aos Fatos](https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/reforma-tributaria-compra-venda-imoveis/) verificaram a mesma publicação e concluíram que as afirmações são falsas. O Comprova também já checou outras peças de desinformação sobre a reforma tributária e concluiu que [não são todos os autônomos que pagarão imposto de 25,6%](https://projetocomprova.com.br/publica%C3%A7%C3%B5es/video-enganoso-sugere-imposto-de-265-sobre-todo-autonomo-reforma-tributaria-cria-excecoes/) e, na seção Comprova Explica, [mostrou a diferença entre a tributação sobre herança no Brasil e nos Estados Unidos](https://projetocomprova.com.br/publica%C3%A7%C3%B5es/entenda-a-diferenca-entre-brasil-e-eua-na-tributacao-do-imposto-sobre-heranca/).
