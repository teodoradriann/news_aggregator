    "title": "Inmetro revela consumo do BYD King: até 44,2 km/litro",
    "text": "Números oficiais do sedã médio da greentech chinesa, rival direto do Toyota Corolla Hybrid, são bem melhores que o do principal concorrente O Inmetro revelou os dados oficiais de consumo do BYD King, que surpreenderam: até 44,2 km/litro na cidade na versão mais cara, a GS. Configuração GL também tem ótimos números O Inmetro revelou nesta semana os números oficiais de consumo do BYD King, lançado oficialmente em junho . E os dados surpreenderam. Positivamente. Segundo a entidade, o sedã é capaz de fazer até 44,2 km/litro quando usa a combinação entre os motores elétrico e a combustão. Vale lembrar que a autonomia no modo 100% elétrico, na versão GS (R$ 187.800), é de pouco mais de 100 quilõmetros. O registro oficial é de 44,2 km/l na cidade e de 36,7 km/l na estrada, com gasolina, na versão que tem bateria de 18,3 kWh. Se o King usa só o motor 1.5 a combustão, sem o elétrico, os números também são bons: 16,8 km/l e 14,7 km/l, respectivamente. Já na versão GL - de entrada (R$ 175.800), que tem bateria de 8,3 kWh - o número apontado foi de 43,3 km/l na cidade e 32,7 km/l na estrada na medição híbrida. Se forem considerados só os dados do motor térmico, os números são de 16,3 km/l e 14,3 km/l, respectivamente. Os números são sempre melhores na cidade. E quanto bebe o Corolla? Para efeito de comparação, o Toyota Corolla híbrido - que não é plug-in, importante dizer - pode fazer 18,5 km/l na cidade e 15,7 km/l na estrada com o mesmo combustível. O King GL tem 209 cv e 8,3 kWh, o que é capaz de fazê-lo rodar 55 km no modo elétrico. Já o King GS, por sua vez, tem conjunto de até 235 cv e 18,3 kWh, com alcance puramente elétrico de pouco mais de 100 km. O sedã tem 4,78 metros de comprimento, 1,83 m de largura, 1,49 m de altura e 2,71 m de entre-eixos. Ou seja, é mais comprido, largo e alto que o Toyota Corolla, que tem 4,63 m de comprimento, 1,78 m de largura e 1,45 m de altura - apesar do entre-eixos quase igual, de 2,70 m. Já o porta-malas é um pouco menor: 450 litros do King contra 470 litros no Corolla. Em termos de equipamentos, há poucas diferenças entre as versões, mas faltam coisas na comparação com o Corolla. O King GL vem com central multimídia com tela de 12,8\" com Android Auto e CarPlay sem fio, wifi, chave inteligente e operações pelo aplicativo, quadro de instrumentos 100% digital, som com seis alto-falantes, câmera 360°, sensores de estacionamento dianteiro e traseiro, banco do motorista com ajuste elétrico e memorizador, freio de estacionamento eletrônico e quatro entradas USB. O GS tem tudo citado e ainda adiciona sistema bidirecional de energia (nesse modo, o carro pode funcionar como tomada e carregar outros dispositivos), mais dois alto-falantes, ajuste elétrico para o banco do passageiro, faróis com DRL integrado, luz ambiente e ar-condicionado com duas zonas de atuação.",

    "title": "One Of The Best Destinations To Escape A Frigid Winter Is An Affordable Spanish City",
    "text": "One Of The Best Destinations To Escape A Frigid Winter Is An Affordable Spanish City\nIf you are feeling the winter blues and working on a modest budget, Spain is one of the best spots in Europe to escape the freezing weather. Temperatures are mild during the coldest months of the year, and the thermometer rarely dips below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) down south in Andalusia. While sun-seekers may be drawn by the beaches of Marbella and Málaga, the warm region is also famed for its history and culture, with cities like Granada, Córdoba, and Cádiz (one of the oldest in Europe) all worth adding to your itinerary. Arguably, the star of the show is Seville, a city that is easy on the wallet and winter packing requirements.\nLocated inland (around a five-hour road trip from Madrid), the Andalusian capital is a laid-back city of around 700,000 people. A settlement has existed here for well over 2,000 years, and it is said that the mythical hero Hercules founded the city on his travels. Conquerors and dynasties have come and gone, and Seville also has a rich place in the arts, providing a stomping ground for the legendary Don Juan and the backdrop for famous operas like \"Carmen\" and \"The Barber of Seville.\" The modern city is an underrated Spanish destination for your bucket list that you can explore in comfort throughout the year and enjoy at prices lower than more well-known tourist hotspots of Barcelona and Madrid. Let's take a look at some of the highlights.\nThings to see and do in Seville\nThe first port of call for many visitors to Seville is the wonderful Plaza de España. Constructed for the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition, its builders certainly pulled out all the stops to impress, creating a town square of sweeping grandeur. Enjoy people-watching while strolling the beautifully tiled colonnades and marvel at the Neo-Moorish architecture while enjoying a boat ride on the crescent canal.\nElsewhere, \"Game of Thrones\" fans will no doubt recognize the incredible Alcázar of Seville, a stunning royal palace made up of a dazzling array of architectural styles, from Moorish to Renaissance. Those who prefer Gothic stylings will have a field day at the gigantic Catedral de Sevilla, the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Here, you can take in superb views from the top of the 800-year-old Giralda Tower and visit the tomb of Christopher Columbus.\nSeville has many events throughout the year, but one of the biggest and most spectacular is the Seville Feria (Seville April Fair). The vibrant week-long festival draws around 1 million visitors each year for a celebration of Andalusian food, dance, and culture. Returning to the matter of affordability, sports fans may savor the chance to experience world-famous La Liga soccer at the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium, home of Sevilla FC. Tickets start out at 50 Euros ($51), a snip compared to seats at more illustrious clubs like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.\nVisiting Seville on a budget\nVisiting a provincial city like Seville comes with generally cheaper costs than you might experience in bigger and more heavily-touristed Spanish cities. Accommodation can be very cheap if you aren't looking for a swanky option, with the price of one night in a budget hotel averaging around $49 (per budgetyourtrip.com). That's around $20 cheaper than equivalent digs in Barcelona. Even splashing out on a high-end stay is relatively modest, with costs per night in a luxury hotel averaging $143 a night compared to $233 in the Catalan capital.\nCorrespondingly, Seville also has an enticing range of restaurants and bars where you can dine without breaking the bank. One of the cheapest and most leisurely options is heading to Freiduría Puerta de la Carne, Seville's oldest fry shop. Fried seafood is a local tradition, and it pairs well with a crisp cold beer (Cruzcampo is the local lager) while enjoying the sunshine. If fish isn't your thing, ordering a tapas plate to share is a fun way to enjoy delicious bites with friends while also saving a few pennies. Seville has plenty of tapas bars to choose from, from the oldest joint in town (El Rinconcillo, opened in 1670) to traditional low-key stores like Casa Moreno, which serves simple platters of cheeses, cured meats, and other delicacies. With the price of beer averaging around 2 Euros ($2.06), a night on the town is also very affordable. All these factors make Seville a delightfully affordable warm-weather winter destination.",

    "text": "Church Supports Education and Small BusinessesBy: December 28, 2023 , The Full Story With a mission to open “doors of greatness” for all, the Mandeville based Power of God Ministries International (PGMI) is investing millions in education, small businesses, and road safety. Founder of the church, Prophet Roydel Rowe, tells JIS News that in September, they provided tuition support to deserving and needy students at a cost of $1.2 million, while also spending a considerable sum on road safety campaigns undertaken by the Transport Operators Development Sustainable Services (TODSS). He says the church strongly believes that the society can “survive in greatness and success,” so its members use their resources to lift persons out of poverty, and “that is our goal” to ensure that reasonable lives can be enjoyed on earth. “Every church is preparing for heaven, but at least one church in the world is preparing for the earth. Our church is preparing God’s people to survive comfortably, and survive happily upon the earth,” Mr. Rowe says. “We go around Jamaica, we stop at bars, and we stop at shops. We do not have to be invited, we just show up at a bar, your shop, and if it is not stocked, we stock it for you. We find people who are doing livestock, chickens and other stuff and provide them with assistance,” he tells JIS News. During the TODSS’ road safety campaigns over several months, the church provided 100 taxi operators in each parish with gasoline. “While doing this, we are sending children to school, we are building houses for people, and taking people out of poverty little by little. We are doing a lot for society. This is what the church’s intentions are all about,” Mr. Rowe says. For persons in deep rural communities where motor vehicles might not be able to traverse at ease, they buy donkeys for those residents who use them to transport water for their small farms, and to move the produce from the fields to markets and buyers. To further their mission in the empowerment of ordinary individuals, the PGMI provides assistance to persons to obtain their passports, birth certificates, and driver’s licences. “This is what this church is all about, and you don’t have to be a member. It doesn’t matter which church you are from, once you are a visitor, we help you. That is what we do,” he notes, adding that for its support to education, all that the church requires is that the students do well. “Whatever we can do to make God’s people happy in any organisation, I will be there,” Mr. Rowe says, pointing out that he and his members are preparing to respond to a request from a St. Andrew based Rastafarian group that has reached out to them for help. He says that whatever legitimate business people are in, and they need help to build up the enterprise, his role is not to be judgemental, but to provide help when resources are available, and to encourage people to use their success to reach others in need. “When I help them, I explain a lot of things to them, like God is love, God is real, and God loves and cares for them, and just as I help them, they must help others, so that they can prosper. We want to give you a career so that you can help yourself, and you can also be independent, that is what we do,” Mr. Rowe explains. Head of TODSS, Egeton Newman, says the support to the public transport sector is very important. “Mr. Rowe is supporting it in a remarkable way, and come next year, he will be doing much more,” he adds.",

The company recently posted a notice on its support site that they are pulling the plug on its dial-up internet service on September 30.\nAOL announced that it routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. It stated that this service would no longer be available in AOL plans. As a result, it would discontinue this service and the associated software, the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, which were optimized for older operating systems and dial-up internet connections, on September 30, 2025. They also added that the change would not affect any other benefits in users’ AOL plans, which they could access at any time on their AOL plan dashboard.\nA spokesperson from AOL stated that they were discontinuing the dial-up internet service component included in certain legacy AOL Advantage, CompuServe, and Netscape Connect Plans as they innovated to meet the needs of today’s digital landscape. He added that this change did not impact the numerous other valued products and services that those subscribers were able to access and enjoy as part of their plans. The spokesperson also mentioned that there was no impact on their users’ free AOL email accounts.\nAOL, formerly known as America Online, connected many households to the World Wide Web (www) for the first time when its soon to be shut down dial-up internet service was launched decades ago. America Online was well known for its free trial discs, which were a common item that seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s in the United States. The name American Online was changed to AOL in 2006. Verizon, a large American telecommunications company, sold both AOL and Yahoo to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm, in 2021, and the deal was worth around $5 billion.\nAlso Read: Why Nvidia & AMD are Paying the U.S. 15% of China Chip Revenue – for the First Time\nAOL’s Journey: A Complete Walkthrough AOL, America’s one of the ideal and best web portals and online service providers, began its journey in 1985 as Quantum Computer Services. The company was later rebranded to America Online in 1991. It grew and rose to prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s; the company managed to provide an early internet experience for millions of users in America. AOL’s aggressive marketing and techniques, like widely distribution of trial CDs, the introduction of countless households to email, chat rooms, and the World Wide Web, made the firm one of the most recognized service providers at the time.\nIn 2000, AOL’s market value skyrocketed to nearly $164 billion. The company was at its peak and became stronger with the acquisition of Time Warner in 2001. After some years, the journey of AOL started to weaken with the introduction of broadband internet, which offers significantly faster speeds than dial-up.\nThe rise of broadband internet posed a significant challenge to AOL’s business model, and the struggled to maintain its market share as consumers shifted from dial-up service to broadband internet. AOL’s subscriber base started to decline in the middle of the 2000s. AOL was later acquired by Verizon Communications in 2015 with the aim of the potential revival of the company. Verizon integrated AOL’s media brands and advertising technology with its advanced media ventures.\nIn 2021, Verizon sold AOL and Yahoo to Apollo Global Management, and the deal further pushed AOL away from internet services and started to emphasize content and advertising. These sales started to shake the identity and ideology of AOL and ultimately initiated the downfall of the company.\nOn September 30, 2025, the company will mark its end of an era by officially discontinuing its dial-up internet service. This will mark the end of the nostalgic era for many users, and the company will be remembered as the one that played a revolutionary role in shaping the digital world. However, the company is planning to discontinue its dial-up internet service; it will continue to provide its free email service, along with other products like identity protection and technical support",

    "title": "New Jersey Lawmakers Mull Stronger Labor Protections for Cannabis Industry Workers",
    "text": "New Jersey lawmakers recently advanced a bill that would expand labor protections for workers in the cannabis industry. If enacted, the measure—which provides stronger union organizing rights, protections for employee representation and collective bargaining, and a clear prohibition on unfair labor practices—would have profound implications for cannabis industry employers.\nQuick Hits\nOn June 30, 2025, the New Jersey Assembly passed Assembly Bill (A) No. 4182, which now must be considered by the New Jersey Senate. The bill comes amid a significant expansion of the industry after New Jersey legalized recreational marijuana use with the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA) of 2021.\nNew Jersey law already provides some labor protections for cannabis industry workers. However, there is a question as to whether some workers involved in the cultivation or harvesting of cannabis fall under the “agricultural laborer” exemption to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).\nA4182 seeks to ensure that all workers in the cannabis industry, including those working for medical and recreational licensed cultivators and dispensaries, have similar labor protections to those provided by the NLRA and similar to those provided to public employees under the New Jersey public employment relations law and the Workplace Democracy Enhancement Act (WDEA). Specifically, the bill would enhance organizing and union rights, empower state authorities to enforce unfair labor practice (ULP) charges, and increase potential penalties for noncompliance.\nKey Terms\nThe bill would define a “[c]annabis employer” as a private employer that is an authorized medical cannabis cultivator, manufacturer, distributor, or dispensary. It would also apply to “[c]annabis worker[s],” defined as employees of a cannabis employer who are not subject to the NLRA.\nState Board of Mediation\nSpecifically, A4182 would expand the responsibilities of the State Board of Mediation in the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (Board) to cover employment in the cannabis industry not covered by the NLRA. The Board would have “exclusive power” to prevent anyone from engaging in any listed ULP and bring enforcement actions against alleged violators. The Board would be required to adopt regulations for selecting majority representatives, negotiation procedures, grievance resolution, and other employment terms.\nThe bill would further provide workers employed by cannabis employers with rights and protections equal to those provided to other workers regarding employee representation, collective bargaining, and unfair labor practices.\nUnfair Labor Practices\nThe bill would prohibit cannabis employers and their representatives from engaging in unfair labor practices, such as:\nSimilarly, it prohibits organizations representing or seeking to represent cannabis workers from engaging in unfair practices against employees or employers.\nOrganizing Protections\nNotably, A4182 contains several protections for cannabis employee organizing and requirements for cannabis employers with regard to employee representatives. Specifically, the bill would grant employee majority representatives or unions the right to access cannabis employers’ premises to meet with employees, investigate grievances, and conduct meetings. The bill would also require employers to provide contact information of employees to the employee organization and to facilitate payroll deductions for union membership dues.\nThe bill would further grant organizations representing cannabis workers “the right to engage in publicity.” Notably, this right would include “picketing … for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers, that products or the ingredients of products are produced by a cannabis employer with which the organization has a dispute,” even if the publicity “has the effect of requesting the public to cease patronizing businesses which distribute or sell those products.” (Emphasis added.)\nFines and Penalties\nA4182 would increase the potential penalties for cannabis employers found to be in noncompliance with the law. The bill would increase the maximum daily fine from $1,000 to $5,000 for each day that an employer failed to provide the required information to the Board or otherwise prevented the Board from carrying out its responsibilities.\nAdditionally, the bill would allow for the imposition of other remedies, such as:\nIf enacted as proposed, the legislation would empower the Board to order a cannabis employer found to have violated the law to “make whole the employee organization for any losses suffered by the organization as a result of the violation.”\nNext Steps\nA4182 aims to ensure that cannabis workers have the same protections and rights as other workers, particularly with regard to collective bargaining and protections against unfair labor practices. The New Jersey Assembly has advanced the bill, but the New Jersey Senate must still pass it. It is unclear whether the bill will gain traction in the Senate now. The bill would take effect immediately upon its enactment into law.\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.
