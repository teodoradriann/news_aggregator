    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — Pat Jones-Horton has never waited for permission to lead.\nFrom her earliest days, whether selling the most Girl Scout cookies in her troop or becoming the hopscotch champion in third grade, she was carving her own path — one that would eventually take her from business to politics to nonprofit leadership and beyond.\n“I really don’t see myself as a pioneer,” she said, laughing. “I’ve done some things by happenstance.”\nMORE | Pioneer of Progress: Brent Beesley\nBut look closer, and her path is anything but accidental.\n“I have always been fighting for justice,” Jones-Horton said. “I’m 75 now and will fight to my death for justice.”\nA lifelong Utah resident, she co-founded Dan Jones & Associates with her late husband Dan in 1980. The public opinion and marketing research firm started small but quickly became one of the most respected in the state.\n“There were just two of us when we started,” she said. “The clients would always ask him the questions — they wouldn’t look toward me. I was an accessory. But he’d always say, ‘Ask her. She wrote the questionnaire, she managed the fieldwork, she wrote the analysis.’ And I always appreciated that.”\nOver the years, she helped guide business strategy and branding from Logan to St. George, shaping what people across Utah saw — and thought about — every day.\n“I did qualitative research on just about everything you see when you go down the freeway,” she said. “We named Trax in focus groups. I did research on tires, ice cream, perfume, malls ... all kinds of things. I’ve seen and heard it all.”\nHer biggest takeaway from all that work? The differences between how men and women think and lead.\n“Men and women have complementary differences in how we think,” she said. “And women have been undervalued for years, largely because we are not in leadership roles as much as we should be.”\nThat belief pushed her into politics in 2006, despite knowing it might raise eyebrows among her firm’s mostly Republican clients.\n“It was a little risky for our business,” she said. “But I felt strongly that was the direction I wanted to go.”\nHer motivation was simple and deeply personal: education.\n“The issue that really drew me in was public education,” she said. “I knew we needed more money for schools. We needed to invest in our kids. I saw it in my own children.”\nShe won a seat in the Utah House of Representatives, then later moved to the Senate, serving 14 years total — 12 of those in leadership. But her approach to politics was as strategic as her research work.\n“I made a point to go sit with Republicans to get to know them better,” she said. “You really get to understand someone when you sit next to them, ask their opinions. That served me well.”\nIn January 2015, she stepped away from politics, handed off her business, and turned 65 — all in the same month.\n“I thought I was retiring,” she said with a smile. “But then Scott Anderson from Zions Bank called.”\nAnderson asked her to take on a new challenge: leading the Women’s Leadership Institute, a nonprofit focused on closing Utah’s gender gap in leadership.\n“Utah does really well economically,” Jones-Horton recalled him saying. “But we rank near the bottom in how women are perceived in the state. Too few women in politics, too few on boards, too few in senior leadership — and a gender wage gap that’s hurting our ability to attract and keep talent.”\nShe accepted and created the \"Elevate HER Challenge,\" urging companies to commit to specific, measurable goals to elevate women into leadership.\n“It’s a commitment for companies to think intentionally about elevating women,” she said. “That’s been magical. It has changed the business culture in our state.”\nHundreds of businesses have taken the challenge — and the ripple effect continues.\n“We need women at all kinds of tables,” she said. “Yes, the kitchen table. But also in boardrooms, legislatures, and places where decisions are made. It’s nice to have a voice, but you need to have a vote.”\nThrough it all, Jones-Horton has balanced life as a mother of four and grandmother to 17. Her work never slowed, but she’s always made time for her family — and now, for herself.\nJust weeks ago, she officially retired for the second time. But if you think she’s slowing down, think again.\n“I bike, take line dancing classes, I’m a drummer, my husband is a guitar player,” she said. “Luckily, I found someone who is perfectly matched.”\nThat partner is Professor Joe Horton, who brings a shared love of music, learning, and energy into this next chapter.\nAfter decades of opening doors, raising voices and asking the tough questions, Pat Jones-Horton is still moving forward — with purpose, and with joy.\n“I’ve learned a lot,” she said. “But one thing hasn’t changed: we all deserve a seat at the table — and I’m going to keep fighting until we’re all there.”\n_____",

The German tactician made the comments in his first public appearance as Red Bull's Head of Global Soccer.\nIn 2023, the Premier League accused Manchester City of breaching 115 financial regulations between 2009 and 2018. The English side have denied all charges, but a verdict on the same is expected sometime this year.\nSince 2009, the Sky Blues have won eight Premier League titles, including four consecutive ones between 2021 and 2024.\nIn the 2018-19 and 2021-22 seasons, Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool missed out on the Premier League title to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City by one point. In a press conference for Red Bull, the former Reds boss was asked about Liverpool potentially being crowned champions if City are stripped of their league titles.\nTrending Klopp said (via Liverpool.com):\n\"We're getting closer [to a decision]. Should [we be handed the titles]? I don't say anything. Would [we be handed the titles]? We had this discussion when we left, if it would happen I told all the people who want it, just book the flight and I buy the beer.\" \"Whatever we have to celebrate, good weather, we would have our own parade in my garden. God what a headline. We will see. I didn't follow it all. I'm surprised you're telling me it [a verdict] is two months away. Let's see.\" Expand Tweet Despite City's dominance in the league during his tenure at Anfield, Jurgen Klopp led Liverpool to the 2019-20 Premier League and the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League titles. He left the club at the end of the 2023-24 season.",

KHOU 11's Kimberly Davis spoke with a psychiatrist at [UT Physicians](https://www.utphysicians.com/) about what parents can do to avoid developing medical conditions. \"Everything that is stressing the parents, every worry, every thought is going to have a physical correlation into their physical health,\" said Cesar Soutullo, MD, PhD. \"Sometimes it's because anxiety or feelings of sadness can impact the blood pressure and make your heart go faster.\" Regular life can be stressful enough, but that stress can be heightened if you are a parent to a child with mental health disorders. \"A lot of what I do is stressing and underlying to the parents that this is not their fault. It's a medical problem that can happen to anyone,\" Soutullo said. He wants parents to know that psychological problems are very common. Parents should be on the lookout for changes in behavior, even if it's small. \"Extreme fears that is impacting the child to the point of avoiding different situations so the child is cutting their freedom,\" Soutullo said. The sooner symptoms of a mental health disorder are detected, the faster a doctor can help. UT Physicians is a paying sponsor of Health Matters",

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link)\nDes syndicalistes portant les drapeaux argentins manifestent devant le Palais de Justice de Buenos Aires, le 27 décembre 2023\nLa principale centrale syndicale d'Argentine, la CGT, a appelé à une grève générale le 24 janvier pour protester contre les premiers décrets et projets de loi de la présidence ultralibérale du nouveau président, Javier Milei.\nC'est la première fois en 40 ans de démocratie qu'un président argentin doit faire face à une grève générale un mois et demi après son arrivée au pouvoir.\nHector Daer, secrétaire général de la CGT qui revendique 7 millions d'affiliés, a annoncé en conférence de presse la grève et une mobilisation prévue devant le parlement qui examinera alors les projets de loi dérégulateurs \"qui vont à l'encontre de toute la société\" et concentrent \"tous les pouvoirs publics\" sur le président.\nLa mobilisation, a poursuivi le dirigeant syndical, vise en particulier un \"décret de nécessité et d'urgence\" publié le 20 décembre par le gouvernement, ouvrant la voie à une dérégulation massive de l'économie, mais au \"caractère illégal et inconstitutionnel\".\n\"Ce décret s'en prend aux droits individuels des travailleurs, aux droits collectifs, à un système de santé universel et solidaire, et à un nombre incalculable de sujets qui constituent notre pays\", a insisté M. Daer.\n\"En moins d'une semaine, ils transforment l'Argentine et nous ramènent à l'Argentine pastorale\", a-t-il dénoncé.\nJavier Milei, ultralibéral et \"anarcho-capitaliste\" comme il se décrit lui-même, a depuis son investiture le 10 décembre publié un décret de dérégulation de l'économie à travers l'abrogation de quelque 300 normes.\nUn décret techniquement en vigueur à partir de vendredi, mais sous réserve d'approbation ultérieure par le parlement.\nIl a aussi poursuivi son élan \"libéral\" en déposant mercredi au parlement un ensemble détaillé de projets ou modifications de lois, affectant une multitude de domaines de la sphère publique et privée : pêle-mêle du fiscal à l'électoral, à la journée de travail, au calcul des retraites, au contrôle et sanctions de manifestations, ou à l'instauration d'un \"divorce express\".\nCe vaste train de réformes, dit \"loi-omnibus\" doit lui aussi être examiné par le parlement, et les avis juridiques divergent sur le temps effectif --des mois, voire des années selon certains-- qu'il faudrait pour examiner les quelque 600 articles.\nUne autre interrogation porte sur l'issue elle-même du processus parlementaire sur certaines dispositions polémiques, avec un parlement sans majorité absolue dans aucune des deux chambres. Et où le parti de Milei, la Libertad Avanza, n'est que la troisième force --même s'il peut compter avec l'appui du bloc de centre-droit, le deuxième en importance.\nLa mobilisation n'a toutefois pas attendu, avec trois manifestations en un peu plus d'une semaine à Buenos Aires, et plusieurs recours en justice déposés contre le décret d'urgence du 20 décembre. Dont certains par la CGT elle-même mercredi.\nSont d'ores et déjà effectives, et avec un effet immédiat sur le porte-monnaie des Argentins, une première série de mesures d'austérité annoncée aux premiers jours de la présidence Milei.\nAinsi la dévaluation de plus de 50% du peso, la devise nationale, et la baisse dès début janvier de subventions aux transports et à l'énergie, se traduisant en une hausse immédiate de tarifs vouée à affecter le quotidien de plusieurs millions d'Argentins.\nL'objectif pour le gouvernement est la réduction drastique du déficit budgétaire chronique de l'Argentine, engluée dans une inflation à 160% sur un an.",

    "text": "T he stock market ended 2023 on a positive note and is poised to have another year of gains as investors look to the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in the coming months.\nA lot has changed in just the past few months to arrive at that happy situation. While the Fed was once signaling rates would be higher for longer, part of a post-COVID-19 pandemic strategy to tame inflation, investors are now pricing in up to six rate cuts over the next year. And Fed officials are taking on a little more dovish tone. That is because recent inflation reports have shown meaningful declines, good news for the economy, and a nice turn for the markets .\nTHREE TIMES BIDEN FORGAVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT DESPITE SUPREME COURT RULING\nThe S&P 500 is now up more than 5% in just the past month alone and rose 25% since the start of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has bounced 6.5% in the past month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up a whopping 45.5% from the start of 2023.\nQuincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said that the most recent consumer price index report, which showed inflation running at a cooler 3.1% pace, helped underpin and confirm that prices were coming down at a faster clip. That is hopeful for investors eager for rate cuts.\n“Not at the point that the Fed could declare victory, but that it is moving in the right direction,” she told the .\nKrosby explained that this latest rally in the markets is better news because it’s more broad-based. She pointed out that it isn’t just a handful of major companies leading the indices higher, but rather small- and mid-cap stocks have also climbed. Notably, the Russell 2000 has popped nearly 15% in the past month alone.\n“The Russell 2000 is a barometer for economic conditions at the most granular level,” she said. “It sends a positive signal.”\nKrosby said that U.S. markets should end up having a decent year. That is because, historically speaking, when there is a strong year for the stock market, as 2023 was, the following year tends to end as a positive one.\n“When all is said and done, the market seems to focus on what the Fed is going to do and the expectations are that the Fed will deliver rate cuts,” Krosby said. “It may not be as early as the market suggests … but at some point, the market expects that there will be rate cuts.”\nA recent report from John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, predicts that the S&P 500 will end up being around the level it is at now when 2024 comes to a close.\n“Fortunately, corporate profits are set to gain traction as we expect market growth to reflect earnings gains. Our base case scenario has the S&P Index fairly valued in the 4,750 range by year-end 2024,” a summary of the report said.\nRodney Lake, vice dean for undergraduate programs at George Washington University and director of the university’s Investment Institute, told the that the perception of these coming rate cuts bodes well for the stock market. He expressed optimism for the year ahead.\n“Many people are expecting that rate cuts are coming, that very likely will continue to lift stocks higher and for our outlook at the GWU Investment Institute, is that the market will move higher in 2024 on a total return basis,” Lake said.\nLake said there are also uncertainties surrounding the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip. If those become broader conflicts involving more actors, it would have the potential to weigh on the equity market, Lake said.\nBut Lake said that outside of the wars broadening, the most significant obstacle for the stock market next year might be if declining inflation suddenly reverses course and begins to move higher. That could cause the Fed to not cut rates and could cause investors to become spooked.\n“In the worst-case scenario, that would get so bad that the market would have to start pricing in higher for longer and potentially an increase,” Lake said. “I think the probability of that is quite low at this point given where inflation has been trending … but I would say that inflation turning around and being higher than expected is probably the most significant thing that could derail a positive outlook for 2024.”\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThomas Mathews, a finance professor at Florida Gulf Coast University, told the that he sees four main drivers for stock performance this coming year: the overall economic performance of the U.S., the Fed’s monetary policy, price momentum, and the U.S. presidential election.\nMathews said he expects single-digit gains for the stock market next year and, at worst, says the market would only end up down by a percentage point or two.\nLatest Ferrari: More terrible than joyful By: Jack Baruth The cultural story of denazification By: Anthony Paletta Stick a spork in 2023 By: Rob Long Videos\nTrump campaign slams Biden on US-Mexico border in ad: 'The world burns'\nLouisiana joins list of states considering disqualifying Trump from primary ballot\nBiden chides Trump over Christmas Day 'rot in hell' wish\nJudge upholds redrawn Georgia congressional map in win for Republicans Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",

    "title": "College Football: SMU gets blanked in second half, Boston College wins",
    "text": "The 2023 college football season was the last for the SMU Mustangs as Group of Five members. Starting next season they will be playing in the ACC, much to the chagrin of the Florida State Seminoles.\nOne of those teams they would play against are the Boston College Eagles. As a matter of fact, the Ponies are set to host Boston College at Gerald J. Ford Stadium next season, the date is yet to be determined.\nAs far as this season, the Mustangs had an opportunity to prove their worth and earn the No. 12 win on the season. It looked good early on before it fell apart in the second half. Boston College ended up winning this future ACC battle, 23-14.\nThe big star of the day was Thomas Castellanos with his two touchdowns. Both of which came on the ground and in the fourth quarter. Overall, the dual-threat rushed for a game-high 156 yards and those two scoring runs of 14+ yards.\nThe SMU offense had no answer for Castellanos as they finished two drives with a punt, two drives ended via turnover on downs, and one missed field goal. Late in the game it was the Eagles offense that was able to put together consistent drives to put the game away.\nNext time these two teams meet, perhaps it will go differently with Preston Stone under center. He missed the game after breaking his leg against Navy on Nov. 25 in the 59-14 win over the Midshipmen.\nNCAA Football: Fenway Bowl-Southern Methodist at Boston College Eric Canha-USA TODAY

    "title": "The Google Pixel Watch 3 Can Call for Help If You Lose Your Pulse",
    "text": "The best thing a company can do for its product—especially for its sales numbers—is to convince the users that it’s essential to living. Google is certainly leaning into that narrative with the Pixel Watch 3. This week, Google’s third-gen smartwatch received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Loss of Pulse Detection feature, which was announced alongside the smartwatch, though it’s been dormant pending clearance. Once the feature rolls out later next month, the Pixel Watch 3 can immediately call for help if your pulse goes out.\nThe feature has been available in the E.U. since the smartwatch’s debut last fall, but this is the first time it’s available in the U.S. Loss of Pulse Detection works precisely as advertised: your heart rate goes null, and the Pixel Watch 3 immediately enters emergency mode. It starts a countdown and sounds off an alarm. If you don’t respond within seconds, it automatically calls emergency services, provided you set that up beforehand with an Android device.\nGoogle says the watch will be able to differentiate between an immediate cardiac event and simply taking off the watch for the day, suggesting that there will be few false positives. Google touts multi-check, an AI-based algorithm that studies the multipath heart-rate sensor for patterns to detect when it’s genuinely a nuanced situation. The company claims it “rigorously tested” the algorithm with “over hundreds of thousands of hours of data” while also cross-referencing it with “a diverse range of experts,” including cardiologists and high-level emergency medical professionals.\nI accidentally triggered the Pixel Watch’s Fall Detection feature before, though it was on the last generation’s hardware. It happened when my foot slid down a hill after a poor landing. False positives happen, but that’s why there’s a few-second countdown and alert so you can call it off when that happens. Regardless, expect Google to market the feature around town, especially since the Apple Watch still can’t do this kind of thing.\nSource link",
