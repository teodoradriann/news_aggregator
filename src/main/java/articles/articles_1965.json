    "text": "Good Samaritans help save 2 men from drowning in water\nKGTV\nBy Dani Miskell\nClick here for updates on this story\nSAN DIEGO (\nKGTV) — Two men are lucky to be alive after somehow falling off Sunset Cliffs early Thursday morning.\nThe men were rescued not only by San Diego Lifeguards but also by good Samaritans who happened to be at the right place at the right time.\nThose good Samaritans told ABC 10News that around 1 a.m. they heard the two men screaming in the water and fighting for their lives, so they immediately took action.\nOne of the Samaritans called 911, while the other jumped into the ocean to help with the rescue.\nWitness Zachary Mallak said, “They were getting smashed in the waves and they were dropped into the cave. And when they were brought into the cave, they didn’t respond. So, they could have gotten stuck there for days; like, who knows what would have happened.”\nRyan Miller, who dove into the waters to help with the rescue, said he was certified at a surf school in Hawaii, so he knew exactly what to do.\n“They were dying,” Miller said. “They were going to die if no one came in, so what was I going to do? Sit there and watch?”\nABC 10News photojournalist Paul Anderegg captured the dramatic moments as Miller helped San Diego Fire-Rescue crews get the two men onto surfboards and out of the water.\nOne of the victims who fell in is seen in the video wearing a white T-shirt, and he, along with his friend, were helped up the cliffs where medics rendered aid.\nSarah Hulbert, another witness at the scene and one of the locals who tried helping the two men in the water, said many came to help in the nick of time before rescue crews arrived.\n“They were throwing surfboards over and trying to get everybody out as safely as possible, and it was honestly amazing,” Hulbert said.\nOn Thursday, San Diego Fire-Rescue’s Newsworthy Incident Fact Sheet showed the rescue transpired in just 90 minutes.\nUpdate: The fact sheet was updated Thursday stating that the two men jumped off the cliffs.\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue Department\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "title": "Bombazo: tras el rechazo de Boca, Palermo reveló que podría ser DT de River",
    "text": "En la previa a las elecciones presidenciales que se desarrollaron en Boca cada candidato tenía su posible entrenador en caso de ser elegido. En el caso de Andrés Ibarra el posible DT iba a ser Martín Palermo, quien se mostró afín a esa línea política. Tras conocerse la historia, se supo que la llegada del Titán sería imposible.\nEl ex goleador del Xeneize participó de un partido benéfico en Brasil y tras eso aprovechpó y respondió algunas preguntas de la prensa local en la que se refirió a su futuro.\nLa bomba de Martín Palermo sobre su futuro dlgFZw5H-34516613.mp4 El entrenador decidió no renovar su vínculo con Platense después de haber jugador la final de la Copa de la Liga, que perdió 1-0 frente a Rosario Central, y ahora su próximo destino es incierto. En este contexto, se le consultó sobre qué propuestas podría aceptar.\nUna de las consultas era si aceptaría dirigir a algún equipo que fuese clásico del Xeneize, como River Plate, Independiente o Racing: “Obviamente, mi trabajo es dirigir el equipo que me proponga ser el entrenador que tenga un proyecto. Estoy preparado para dirigir cualquier equipo”.\nEsta frase disparó la discusión en redes sociales, sobre todo por aquellos boquenses que lo idolatran y que esperaban tal vez otra respuesta del Titán. Es importante destacar que en la actualidad el Millonario no tiene en carpeta al ex delantero, y tampoco es opción en Racing e Independiente, que están bajo las direcciones técnicas de Gustavo Costas y Carlos Tevez, respectivamente. Por eso, Palermo aguarda también por alguna oferta del exterior, ya sea Chile, México o incluso Brasil.\nPese a la gran rivalidad que existe entre los dos clubes más poderosos de la Argentina, han habido algunos técnicos que se han puesto el buzo de uno de esos equipos, pese a haber estado identificados con el otro.\nPor ejemplo, Juan José López, quien fuera futbolista de ambos conjuntos y además dirigió a River Plate en 2011, o César Luis Menotti, quien tuvo un paso como jugador de Boca Juniors y fue entrenador de ambos clubes. Héctor Bambino Veira también es un caso a destacar porque supo dirigir a ambos.\nTe puede interesar...\nLa foto: con qué jugador de Boca se puso de novia Morena Beltrán\nJuan Román Riquelme ya es presidente de Boca, pero aún no asumió: la nueva fecha\nLo más leído\nAuditoría de Rolando Figueroa Escándalo con planes sociales: mandan cartas documento a empleados públicos para que \"devuelvan la plata\"\nInvestigación Accidente fatal en la Ruta 151: ¿quién tuvo la culpa?\nDNU La CGT llama a un paro general para el 24 de enero\nbajo neuquino Chocaron en Avenida Mosconi, un auto derrapó y atropelló a una mujer\nRecibí las noticias del día en tu e-mail * Campo requerido Leé más\nLa foto: con qué jugador de Boca se puso de novia Morena Beltrán\nJuan Román Riquelme ya es presidente de Boca, pero aún no asumió: la nueva fecha\nRevelan cuál es el campeón del mundo que nunca jugaría en River: \"Es de Boca\"",

    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Based in Austin, the country's largest housing provider to unaccompanied migrant children is being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice, [accused of \"engaging in patterns\" of sexual abuse and harassment](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/housing-provider-for-migrant-children-engaged-in-sexual-abuse-and-harassment-doj-says) through its employees. For 20 years, Southwest Key has sheltered migrant children who have came to the United States alone and helped reunite them with family or a guardian. Funded with grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it has 29 child migrant shelters with 17 here in Texas. In total they can accommodate more than 6,000 children. \"Unaccompanied minors have zero social network, or a safety net, call it.\" Austin Immigration and Federal Litigation Attorney George Lobb said. \"They've got no social base, no one in the United States to protect them, and the only one that is supposed to is the government, and they failed in doing that by allowing southwest keys to watch over them.\" The Department of Justice alleges some employees - even supervisors - have engaged in rape, unwanted touching and the solicitation of sex and nude images of those children since at least 2015, with some victims as young as five. In one instance out of El Paso, an eight-year-old reported a Youth Care Worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\" \"If you properly train staff, screen them and do ratios, you will, you will eliminate a lot of these issues and reduce suffering.\" Lobb said. \"It's impossible to completely eliminate this, and we know this, but there is a pattern and practice of Southwest Keys putting profit before people, and this is a disgusting culmination of that policy.\" The lawsuit says the children were threatened with violence against them and their families to ensure their silence, and in some cases, Southwest Key was even aware of the abuse but didn't report it. The lawsuit also describes employees acting as \"spotters\" while other employees committed the abuse. The D.O.J. alleges Southwest Key failed to take appropriate actions to protect the children in their care, a violation of the Fair Housing Act. [ALSO| ATX city council passes resolution requiring safety barriers at medical facilities](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/atx-city-council-passes-resolution-requiring-safety-barriers-at-medical-facilities) \"If you have an FHA grant, or you're operating an FHA facility, you have to comply with all federal law, including you can't discriminate,\" Lobb said. \"And part of sex discrimination is sexual harassment, rape, child pornography - which is also listed in the lawsuit - among other things.\" In a statement to CBS Austin Thursday, Southwest Key says: Southwest Key Programs’ primary focus is the safety, health, and well-being of each one of the children and youth we care for. We continue to review the complaint, and it does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children. We are in constant communication and continue to closely partner with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), as we have done so for the past two decades to ensure the children and youth entrusted to our care are safe with us during their short stay with Southwest Key. The D.O.J. is asking for an immediate stop to these discriminatory practices and action to prevent future abuse, reparations for the victims and civil penalties against Southwest Key. \"You take the most vulnerable people on the planet and stick them in a situation in which they are targets, ripe targets for abuse,\" Lobb said. \"We have the money to put people on busses and fly them around the country, but we're not spending money to protect kids.\" An anonymous hotline to report abuse is available on hhs.gov... or you can call the Justice Department at 1-833-591-0291 and Dial 2 for Spanish.",

    "title": "'It's a Christmas miracle' King grants permission for William Brown, 7, to be buried in Folkestone churchyard",
    "text": "The parents of seven-year-old William Brown have been granted permission to bury their son at his ‘favourite spot’ after he tragically died in a crash near Folkestone. Will was struck by a car as he walked in Sandgate Esplanade on December 6.\nHis parents William Brown Snr and Laura Brown issued a plea earlier this month for their son to be buried at the Church of St Mary & St Eanswythe graveyard. However, an order from the Privy Council from 1855 closed the churchyard to burials and it has remained in place ever since.\nThe mum travelled to Sandringham on Christmas Day where the Royal family attended a service and delivered a letter to King Charles III asking him to allow their son to be laid to rest at the church in Folkestone.\nREAD MORE:\nHistoric bar visited by Ed Sheeran in one of Kent's prettiest villages closes 'with immediate effect'\nREAD MORE:\nTwo children seriously injured after M2 crash that left motorway closed for 7 hours\nLaura told KentLive: “His favourite spot is under the conker tree and that’s where he’s going to be buried. So we’re overjoyed. I was so desperate because I really wanted to lay my son to rest.\n“The application was supported by Bishop Rose and Father John. They had to find a space and when the space was available, the application was submitted.\n“Then the only people that could amend the law were the King and the Privy Council. I was praying for a Christmas miracle and it happened.”\n'I really feel blessed'\nThe grieving mum said she has nothing but ‘gratitude’ towards the King and his peers. She added: “It’s because of them that we can finally lay our son to rest in a place he loved and adored. That’s really kind of him.\n“And to grant my son that blessing. He’s just an amazing man. He’s a wonderful King. I feel really blessed that he took the time out of his day to do that for my son.”\nLaura described her son as a “sweet, gentle, loving son, who was kind to everybody”. The mum said Christmas without Will was ‘horrendous’.\n“I dropped his presents off at the morgue and on Christmas Day I drove to Sandringham and I arrived at about 6am to give my letters out to the King security, I was so desperate.”\nCommunity invited to funeral\nThe parents are hoping to bury their son on January 13. They\n invited the community to attend his funeral to spread their son’s message of “love, peace, unity and togetherness”.\nHis dad Will Snr told KentLive shortly after the announcement: “Since receiving the uplifting news from the King, we are now planing the public funeral to share William’s message of love and unity.\n“As a family we are so grateful for all parties involved in supporting us in this tragic time. The community has been pillar of support and we cannot thank them enough.\n“I feel as a father my son is being honoured and recognised in the best possible way and this is helping me through… I’m so thankful. I feel so proud to be part of my son’s journey. Even in his passing. William still resonates positively.”\nKentLive has approached the Privy Council for a comment.\nGet more news from KentLive straight to your inbox for free\n HERE.",

    "text": "La expulsión de la embajadora de Nicaragua en Brasil, en reciprocidad a una medida similar adoptada por Managua, abre un nuevo frente de conflicto en la izquierda de América Latina, ya divida por la crisis electoral venezolana.El primer paso para la mutua expulsión de embajadores lo dio el Gobierno de Daniel Ortega, que ordenó abandonar el país al embajador brasileño en Nicaragua, Breno Souza da Costa, por su ausencia, el pasado 19 de julio, en los actos conmemorativos del 45 aniversario de la revolución sandinista.Brasilia pagó con la misma moneda y este jueves expulsó a la embajadora nicaragüense, Fulvia Castro, en aplicación del 'principio de reciprocidad' que rige en las relaciones diplomáticas, frente a una medida que fuentes consultadas por EFE consideraron 'injustificada'.Según las mismas fuentes, la ausencia del embajador en los actos del 19 de julio no fue más que una 'excusa' para esconder el claro deterioro de la relación entre Ortega y el presidente brasileño, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, muy estrecha en una época que ya pasó.Lula conoció a Ortega precisamente un 19 de julio, pero de 1980, cuando asistió al festejo del primer aniversario de la revolución sandinista, ocasión en que tuvo su primer contacto personal con el cubano Fidel Castro, fallecido en 2016. La negativa de Ortega a una mediación pedida por el papa Las relaciones entre Lula y Ortega fueron fraternales, incluso en el ámbito del Foro de Sao Paulo, pero tomaron otro rumbo sobre todo desde el año pasado, después de que el papa Francisco le pidió al líder brasileño que abogara por un obispo preso en Nicaragua.'Conversé con el papa y él me pidió que conversara con Ortega sobre un obispo que estaba preso', dijo Lula el mes pasado a un grupo de corresponsales extranjeros, en referencia al religioso Rolando Álvarez.Lula lo intentó, pero sin éxito. 'Lo concreto es que Ortega no me atendió el teléfono y no quiso hablar conmigo. Entonces, nunca más hablé con él', reveló.Pero fue más allá. Lamentó que eso ocurra con 'un tipo que hizo una revolución como la que hizo Ortega' y confesó que hoy duda 'si esa revolución fue porque quería el poder o porque quería mejorar la vida de su pueblo'. Nicaragua y Venezuela, divisores de agua en la izquierda Las expulsiones de embajadores ocurren en momentos en que Lula, con los presidentes de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, y México, Manuel Andrés López Obrador, intentan una negociación para buscar una salida a la grave crisis abierta en Venezuela tras las elecciones del pasado 28 de julio.Nicaragua es uno de los pocos países de América Latina que ha reconocido a Nicolás Maduro como presidente electo, pese a que las autoridades electorales venezolanas aún no han publicado las actas de un proceso que la oposición denuncia como fraudulento.Otros países en la izquierda regional que han reconocido el resultado proclamado por el Consejo Nacional Electoral de Venezuela, pese a la falta de datos, han sido Bolivia y Cuba, que felicitaron a Maduro sin siquiera esperar el escrutinio.Una posición opuesta a la del presidente chileno, Gabriel Boric, un férreo crítico de Maduro desde el progresismo y quien este miércoles, un día después de una visita de Lula a Santiago, dijo no tener dudas de que Maduro 'ha intentado cometer un fraude'.Esa afirmación generó una dura respuesta de Venezuela, que acusó a Boric de 'golpista' y le endosó un insulto inaceptable para un socialista chileno: 'pinochetista'.Lula, próximo a Maduro en el pasado, pero distanciado ahora como lo está de Ortega desde hace meses, intenta mediar junto con Petro y López Obrador, y exige 'la publicación de las actas electorales' y una verificación 'imparcial' del resultado, que el madurismo no acepta.Un rechazo al parecer distante de la idea de democracia que tiene Lula, para quien 'lo más sano' es que los procesos electorales sean 'limpios y transparentes' y se respete 'la alternancia en el poder' cuando así lo decide 'la soberanía popular'.",

    "text": "Venezuela anuncia ejercicio militar y acusa al Reino Unido de “provocación hostil” por buque en las costas de Guyana\nmacamilarincon\n(CNN Español) –– El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, anunció este jueves que ordenó una acción conjunta defensiva en respuesta a lo que señaló como una “provocación del Reino Unido” luego de que inicialmente la BBC reportara, citando al Ministerio de Defensa británico, que se enviaría un buque patrullero a las costas de Guyana.\n¿Cómo es la riqueza del Esequibo y cómo contribuyó al crecimiento exponencial de Guyana?\n“Por eso he ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la fuerza armada nacional militar bolivariana sobre el caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensiva como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país”, afirmó Maduro durante la ceremonia de salutación de fin de año a la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB).\nLa reacción de Venezuela sigue a un reporte de la BBC del domingo en el que indicaba, citando al Ministerio de Defensa, que el Reino Unido se preparaba para “enviar un buque de guerra a Guyana en una muestra de apoyo diplomático y militar a la antigua colonia británica”.\n¿Qué sigue ahora en la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana por el Esequibo? Puntos claves del acuerdo y posibles escenarios\nEl HMS Trent, un patrullero de la Marina británica, agregó la BBC, visitará Guyana, “aliado regional y socio de la Commonwealth, a finales de este mes como parte de una serie de compromisos en la región durante su despliegue de tareas de patrulla en el Atlántico”. El Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido confirmó a CNN en Londres esta declaración.\nMaduró calificó a la respuesta venezolana como “acción conjunta militar general Domingo Sifonte” en honor al general que Maduro considera héroe de la Guyana Esequiba y a quien, además, se le rendirá homenaje en enero “trayendo sus restos a que descanse definitivamente en el panteón de los héroes de Venezuela”.\nVenezuela y Guyana acuerdan seguir con diálogo sobre disputa del Esequibo\nLa Cancillería de Venezuela publicó un comunicado en rechazo a la llegada del buque británico y advirtió a la Comunidad del Caribe (Caricom) y a la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac) de que las acciones contradicen el entendimiento acordado el 14 de diciembre entre Venezuela y Guyana.\n“La presencia de la nave militar es extremadamente grave, ya que viene acompañada de declaraciones por parte de voceros políticos y militares de quien fungió como despojador de la Guyana Esequiba, el cual insiste en inmiscuirse en dicha controversia”, dice el comunicado.\nEl encuentro que se llevó a cabo el 14 de diciembre entre los mandatarios de Guyana y Venezuela en San Vicente y las Granadinas cerró con el compromiso de mantener la vía diplomática como el único camino para resolver el conflicto, y se estableció el acuerdo de 11 puntos suscrito por las partes y los mediadores de ambos países.\n“Venezuela insta a las autoridades guyanesas a tomar medidas inmediatas para el retiro del buque HMS Trent, y abstenerse de seguir involucrando a potencias militares en la controversia territorial”, afirma el comunicado.\nCNN está intentando comunicarse con el Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido por los informes de que personal militar venezolano participará en ejercicios militares en el golfo de Paria en respuesta al despliegue del HMS Trent en Guyana.\nOsmary Hernández colaboró con este reporte.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
