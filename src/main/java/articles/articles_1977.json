    "title": "FOCUS: Competitive pay at TSMC plant may ripple across Japan, beat inflation",
    "text": "The world's leading contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. could infuse new momentum into pay hikes that outpace price increases in inflation-plagued Japan, an essential element Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has long pursued. TSMC's generous compensation packages to recruit for a new plant in Kikuyo, Kumamoto Prefecture, can serve as a wakeup call to manufacturers not just around the area but in other regions of the country, economists say. The spillover effect will be critical as the world's third- largest economy is at risk of stagflation if wage hikes continue falling behind price rises. \"Tailwinds are blowing,\" said Kazuma Kishikawa, an economist at Daiwa Institute of Research. The Taiwanese company's $8.6 billion plant along with other vast spending plans by its peers such as Rapidus Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. could spur more investment and competition for talent and hence labor market liquidity and wage growth in broader sectors, he said. The Kishida government is poised to help the chip industry with financial aid to meet its goal of tripling domestic sales of semiconductors, parts and materials to 15 trillion yen ($105 billion) by 2030, while seeking to encourage companies to boost capital spending through tax credits. Japan sees domestic chip production as critical for its economic security, as heavy dependence on major supplier Taiwan poses geopolitical risks stemming from rising tensions between the United States and China over the self-ruled island. According to the Japanese Trade Union Confederation around 5,300 of its member unions agreed with their managements on average pay hikes of 3.58 percent in their 2023 wage negotiations, the sharpest rise in about 30 years. Still inflation-adjusted wages fell from a year earlier for the 19th consecutive month in October as wage growth failed to catch up with rising prices. \"I strongly ask everyone in the business community to accelerate domestic investment and, above anything else, to achieve wage growth that will exceed this year's,\" Kishida said at a recent event organized by the country's most influential business lobby, the Japan Business Federation. Backed by up to 476 billion yen in subsidies, TSMC plans to hire 1,700 workers to start production in December 2024 at the plant, a joint venture with Sony Group Corp. and Denso Corp., and the Taiwanese chipmaker's first manufacturing base in Japan. TSMC offered starting salaries of 280,000 yen per month to university graduates in 2022, 40 percent higher than the local average of around 200,000 yen, according to local college officials. The figure was also 27 percent higher than the national average monthly salary for new graduates of roughly 220,000 yen for the year to March 2024, according to Sanro Research Institute.

I can absorb the world's most advanced skills and knowledge there and receive good wages and benefits,\" said a 19-year-old student at the Kumamoto Prefectural College of Technology, a two-year college in Kikuyo. He will start his career as an associate engineer at TSMC's Kumamoto plant from April with a monthly salary of around 230,000 yen. With Japan facing a shrinking workforce, local companies are struggling to secure enough employees around Kikuyo, a town of around 44,000 people where TSMC and its suppliers are gathering in an industrial park district to create a cluster of semiconductor-related businesses. Economists expect competition for talent and wages to intensify nationwide. In the semiconductor industry, recently created chipmaker Rapidus is building a new chip plant in Hokkaido and U.S. chip giant Micron Technology is ramping up production capacity in Hiroshima Prefecture, both supported by subsidies of roughly 200 billion to 300 billion yen each. Toshiba Corp. and Kioxia Corp. are also boosting production lines. TSMC is considering a second plant and reportedly a third in Japan, supported by more government financial support. \"Considering TSMC is hiring people from across the country, the trend of wage hikes could spread nationwide, while the pain would be felt among small and medium-sized businesses that are not able to keep up with wage hikes,\" said Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association projects eight major domestic chipmakers alone will face shortages of 40,000 workers over the next decade. With more chip-related companies building plants around and outside Kikuyo, Kyushu Financial Group estimates that the clustering of chip businesses in Kyushu, which is made up of Kumamoto and seven other prefectures, will have an economic impact of about 7 trillion yen in the region over the 10 years from 2022. While small companies find it difficult to raise pay, economists say they have to offer competitive salaries to entice young talent. It is also unclear whether salaries, investment and employment can increase in the long term without government financial assistance, DIR's Kishikawa said. \"It is necessary...to create an environment to attract investment without government subsidies in the future,\" he said. Human resources development also remains a crucial challenge for Japan Inc. to maintain growth even with its dwindling working population. The Kumamoto Prefectural College of Technology has teamed up with Kumamoto University to allow its students to transfer to the university's faculty of engineering as third-year students, starting April 2024, said Yuzo Obara, president of the tech college. The National Institute of Technology, Kumamoto College will also start offering a joint research program in cooperation with Kumamoto University from April 2025. \"It is a once-in-a-century opportunity we can't miss to address underlying problems,\" said Chikao Fukushima, chairman of Kikuyo's town council.",

    "text": "Iran launched as many as 120 intermediate-range ballistic missiles at Israel on April 13, US and Israeli officials say. US SM-3 and Israeli Arrow interceptors destroyed nearly all of them, leaving drones and smaller threats to the Iron Dome system.\nIn previous months, interceptors fired from US Navy destroyers stopped Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles, while in Ukraine, US-made MIM-104 Patriot batteries have shot down advanced Russian Iskander and Khinzal missiles.\nReuters spoke with six experts who said more militaries would look to invest in ballistic missile defence, a potential windfall for companies such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which build those types of systems.\nUS mistakenly killed civilian in 2023 Syria strike, says Pentagon \"It's undeniable that any wealthy country with the technological wherewithal will continue to invest in missile defence,\" said Ankit Panda of the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a defence and security think tank. \"All of this is a recipe for a conventional arms race.\"\nEuropean countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Poland already operate RTX subsidiary Raytheon's Patriot batteries, the most common Western advanced ballistic missile defence system.\nSaudi Arabia has used its Patriots for years to defend against Houthi attacks; it and the United Arab Emirates also operate the Lockheed Martin Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain have Patriot batteries as well, and Oman has expressed interest in missile defence.\nIn the US, Lockheed Martin in April won a $17.7 billion contract for a next-generation interceptor for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program - designed to shoot down small numbers of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) aimed at the continental United States.\nBut the impact may be most acute in Asia, where China has invested heavily in conventionally armed ballistic missiles. A 2023 Pentagon report said the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force has about 500 DF-26 missiles, designed to accurately strike targets thousands of kilometres away.\nLarge fire in Ukrainian port of Odesa after missile strike That puts US and allied bases in Japan and Guam within range of an attack that may only come with 20 to 30 minutes' warning.\n\"In the Pacific, you'll see further interest in missile defence, which will push the Chinese to build more systems,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. \"Countries will want to acquire (offensive) missiles because they see other countries using them ... That will drive up demand for missile defences.\"\nUS Indo-Pacific Command and China's Ministry of Defence did not respond to requests for comment.\nChina rarely discusses its missile arsenal beyond statements that its forces are meant to preserve peace and are not aimed at any specific country.\nRaytheon did not respond to a request for comment. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson referred questions to the company's first-quarter earnings briefing in late April, in which it said it continued to lead the industry in \"missile defence missions, which, given world events, are becoming more critical than ever\".\n'Remark made in a broader point': US defends Biden's statement calling India, China, Russia & Japan 'xenophobic' Dollar signs\nBallistic missile defence works by spotting an attacking weapon either at launch or in flight, then using a surface-based radar to guide an interceptor to the target.\nInterceptions can occur in the atmosphere or in space, and each domain requires different hardware. For instance, fins won't work outside the atmosphere - interceptors must have small steering rockets to function there.\nThe necessary high-powered computers, far-seeing radars and missiles as large as telephone poles are not cheap, together stretching into the billions. In 2022, for example, the US approved the sale of both Patriots and THAAD systems to Saudi Arabia, in deals worth as much as $5.3 billion.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, wealthier countries such as Japan, Australia and South Korea are prime candidates for missile defence, Lewis said, while nearly every country in Asia is already investing in missiles.\nJapan's defence ministry said the country \"needs to fundamentally and swiftly reinforce its defence capabilities, including integrated air and missile defence\". It said it is investing in improved Patriot missiles, better radars and enhanced naval anti-missile capabilities.\nIn its latest defence budget, South Korea increased funding by 12% for its Korea Air and Missile Defense System to expand it \"from the existing lower-level defence concept,\" the country's defence ministry said in a statement.\n\"Cases such as the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war have reaffirmed the importance of a 'ballistic missile defence system' to respond to increasingly sophisticated missile threats,\" the ministry said.\nIn mid-April, Australia announced a A$500 million ($328 million) contract with Lockheed Martin to deliver its Joint Air Battle Management System for tracking and destroying aircraft and missiles.\nThe cost of a ballistic missile is often much cheaper than the system meant to stop it.\nBut that isn't the right way to consider cost, said Yoji Koda, former commander in chief of Japan's Self-Defense Fleet, and an advocate of stronger missile defences in his country.\n\"In a war economy, the cheaper the better. But sometimes what is necessary, is we need to protect key infrastructure, or key command centres, at any cost. Because without them we would lose.\"\nIndia lodges protest with China over its infra development in Shaksgam valley The China question\nMost of China's conventionally armed ballistic missiles are designed to hit targets on land.\nBut it also fields steerable warheads meant to hit ships at sea, including the DF-21D and variants of the DF-26, developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.\nSuch anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) had never been used in combat until late 2023, when Houthi forces in Yemen began firing Iranian-made models at ships in the Red Sea.\nBetween November - the first documented use - and April, US Central Command reported at least 85 ASBMs fired in the region, with 20 interceptions and one civilian ship reported sunk.\nCENTCOM has declined to provide specifics about the effectiveness of Iranian ASBMs but has noted missiles posing no threat were not engaged and most that were not intercepted landed harmlessly.\nThe effectiveness of missile defences on land and at sea will catch China's attention, said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the Nuclear Policy Program and Carnegie China.\n\"It raises the possibility that the US and its allies could depend on missile defence significantly against a ballistic missile attack,\" Zhao said.\nAlthough the technical specifics of China's missiles are closely held secrets, the country's heavy investment means they are likely to be more reliable, and are widely believed to use complex countermeasures to complicate interception.\n\"For opponents such as China which have missile stockpiles an order of magnitude larger than that of Russia or Iran and which field more sophisticated systems ... it's not clear that the lessons learned invalidate existing operational constructs,\" said Sidarth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\nBut the political and practical incentives to invest in missile defence will be too attractive for many countries to ignore, Lewis said.\n\"All defence procurement decisions are ultimately about politics,\" he said. \"The politics of this stuff is really simple: do you want to defend the country or not? And the winning answer is always 'Yes'.\"",

    "text": "After Arsenal had conceded a contentious goal from a move that may have involved the ball rolling out of play at Newcastle, Mikel Arteta’s response was to lambast the officials .\nThe same thing happened in the defeat to West Ham in Arsenal’s final home game of 2023, but this time there was no furious tirade. Instead, Arteta calmly acknowledged that their opponents had been “better in both boxes”. Publicly at least, Arteta focused on his team’s shortcomings rather than the limitations of VAR and the technology available.\nIt was an unforeseen loss and an incredibly frustrating evening all around. By every conceivable metric, Arsenal were dominant: they had 75 per cent of the ball, registered 30 shots to West Ham’s six and had 77 touches in the opposition penalty area without scoring, a Premier League first.\nBut they lost on the only metric that matters: goals scored. A 2-0 deficit would have become a 3-0 loss had David Raya not kept out Said Benrahma’s penalty with virtually the final action of the game. Arsenal have now failed to score in all three of their Premier League defeats this season.\nArsenal’s misfiring attack has been an issue that has bubbled away throughout the campaign, but there has been no greater example of their profligacy than on Thursday night. “If we don’t score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score,” Arteta said, adopting a glass half-full approach.\nHere are four ways Arteta can attempt to fix it.\nBuy a new striker Buying a new No 9 next month is the obvious and most popular solution as far as the fans are concerned, but barring something unforeseen, it seems unlikely to materialise.\nRelated Article Football The Score Our verdict on all 20 Premier League teams after Gameweek 19 Read More Arteta’s issue is that he has two very good strikers but not an outstanding one and January is a tricky time to buy a centre forward that would truly elevate Arsenal’s attack.\nIvan Toney and Victor Osimhen are the names that have most regularly been linked with Arsenal and both would be an upgrade on Gabriel Jesus, at least in a goalscoring sense. The loudest groan of the night on Tuesday came when Jesus nodded a relatively straightforward chance over the bar. He is a historical xG underperformer and is showing no signs of sharpening his finishing touch.\nOsimhen would be the dream signing, but with Napoli fighting for a top four place in Serie A only a mind-boggling offer would tempt them into a sale. Brentford are also determined to keep Toney who hasn’t played since April in any case due to his betting ban.\nBoth players are likely to be available in the summer, but not having one before then could well be the difference between winning or not winning the league.\nGive Martinelli a breather Gabriel Martinelli’s drop-off is starting to become a major problem. The Brazilian was superb last season, scoring 15 Premier League goals and setting up five more. However, he has just two apiece after his first 17 matches of 2023-24.\nAt his best, Martinelli is one of the best counter-attacking wingers in Europe, a devastating blend of pace, directness and end product. When off form he is ineffective, easy to defend against in a low block and prone to charging head down into congestion. Arsenal fans have seen more of the latter of late.\nMartinelli has struggled for form this season (Photo: Getty) The reasons for his dip are varied. It could be a confidence issue: Martinelli has looked more hesitant in and around the box and is averaging 1.7 shots per game compared to 2.2 last season.\nPerhaps it’s tactical and he misses the safety net that Granit Xhaka provided as the left-sided central midfielder. Or maybe he’s suffering from burnout. Since the start of 2023-24, Martinelli has started 50 of Arsenal’s 57 league games. That’s a lot to ask of a 22-year-old.\nBukayo Saka, who is a few months younger than Martinelli, also looks jaded and has played even more football. He too could probably benefit from a breather but is simply too important to take out.\nRejig the frontline Following on from the above point, it is perhaps an opportune time for Arteta to rejig his frontline. Neither Martinelli nor Jesus have been consistent enough to warrant automatic selection and as Gary Neville pointed out after the draw at Anfield, as a front three with Saka, they just aren’t clicking as a unit right now.\n“I’m just thinking about the great front threes and then about Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, and Gabriel Martinelli,” he said on the Gary Neville Podcast.\nRelated Article Football Big Read The football fans who blocked VAR and Saudi money - and have the most exciting league in Europe Read More “Not even just in goals, they don’t combine a lot together within the game to play, and I just feel as though that’s going to cost Arsenal at some point. I don’t see them [sic] three linking together a lot.”\nLeandro Trossard has contributed to as many league goals as Martinelli has despite playing half as many minutes and warrants a sustained run in the side either on the left or through the middle.\nPerhaps a Trossard, Havertz, Saka frontline could be the way to go against Fulham on New Year’s Eve.\nBring Smith Rowe back into the fold The forgotten man of Arteta’s Arsenal revolution, at least outside of north London. Emile Smith Rowe is approaching a crossroads point in his career. Unless he forces his way back into Arteta’s plans soon, he will have to move on.\nInjuries have played a part in his decline – according to Transfermarkt , Smith Rowe has missed 23 games since the start of 2022-23 due to injury – but he has also struggled for pitch time when fit. The 23-year-old has only started one Premier League game in the past 18 months.\nHe has been unfortunate that Xhaka made the left-sided central midfield role that he favours his own last season and that Havertz was bought for big money to play in that position in the summer.\nArteta’s decision to start Trossard over Smith Rowe despite Havertz’s suspension in midweek seemed like a significant call. If Smith Rowe does have a future at Arsenal Arteta should reintegrate him at a time when other attackers are struggling.",

    "text": "¡Sólo tiene 13 años! Niño se convierte en el primer jugador en pasar el Tetris, a 40 años de su lanzamiento Tuvieron que pasar cuatro décadas para que un pequeño de trece años se convirtiera en el primer humano conocido en vencer al Tetris Willis Gibson. Grábate bien el nombre de este niño de 13 años que con un \"me voy a desmayar, no siento mis dedos\", se convirtió en el primer humano en ganar el Tetris, luego de 40 años de haberse lanzado el histórico juego y que nadie creyera posible pasar del nivel 29. Este pequeño hizo historia y únicamente provocó que al llegar nada más y nada menos que al nivel 157, Tetris se bloqueara. Su hazaña ya le está dando la vuelta al mundo y nosotros aquí te la contamos, pues si ya era increíble que completara el juego que nadie pudo a lo largo de 40 años, debemos decirte que lo logró en tan sólo 38 minutos. Willis Gibson, un pequeño gigante del Tetris Tetris fue creado en la década de los 80 por el ingeniero soviético Alexey Pajitnov y ganó popularidad luego de su debut en Nintendo y en la consola Game Boy a partir del año 1989. Desde esa fecha, nadie había llegado más allá del nivel 29, de acuerdo a lo que documentan los récords que fueron expuestos por la BBC de Londres. Willis Gibson juega desde los once años y ha competido en varios torneos, aunque lo que logró recientemente le ha dado esa visibilidad que quería desde que fundó su canal de YouTube, en donde se hace llamar \"Blue Scuti\". En declaraciones retomadas por el medio británico, Willis dice que cuando comenzó \"a jugar este juego, nunca esperé vencerlo o que se bloqueara\". Justo cuando llegó al nivel 157, el Tetris se bloqueó y consiguió lo que nadie: ser el primer humano conocido en ganar el Tetris, pero no sólo eso, hacerlo en un tiempo de 38 minutos, con una marca de puntos general y romper otros tres récords mundiales del Tetris. Ya hasta quieren derrotarlo La competitividad siempre es buena. Saber que alguien es mejor que tú en algo, debería ser cuestión de inspiración para competir contra ti mismo y, de paso, ser el primer lugar porque, en efecto, se vale la competencia para ser igual o mejor que Willis Gibson. De acuerdo a las propias palabras de este pequeño, otros jugadores han intentado batir el récord de este niño de 13 años y aunque muchos han documentado en redes sociales sus intentos, ninguno ha conseguido llegar tan lejos como él. El que persevera alcanza, les decimos. Felicidades a Willis Gibson y suerte a quienes intentan conseguir lo que nadie, hasta que llegó él, consiguió: ser el primero en ganar el Tetris.
