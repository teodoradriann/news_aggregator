    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests. If you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported.\nThe once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.\nThe date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported.\nHere’s what we know about the date.\nWhat does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month.\n\"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\"\nThe numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number.\nProfessional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.”\nIf you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12.\nThe number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.\nFYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks\nWhat are some dates to keep in mind in 2024? If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.\nA palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nNumerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.\nHere are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac :\n4/2/24 4/20/24 4/21/24 4/22/24 4/23/24 4/24/24 4/25/24 4/26/24 4/27/24 4/28/24 4/29/24 Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today\n30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",

    "title": "Hochul’s congestion pricing betrayal",
    "text": "On an apparent impulse she may regret for the rest of her life, Kathy Hochul disgraced the office of the governor of New York and possibly torpedoed her political career, starting with her reelection bid in 2026.\nJust weeks before congestion pricing tolls were set to turn on and start delivering faster commutes and billions of dollars in transit improvements for eight and a half million New Yorkers, Gov. Hochul announced her dark-of-night decision to shelve the program “indefinitely.”\nShe evidently was so ashamed of her weak-kneed and secretive decision, she made the announcement by video, presumably so she could read from a tightly written script and avoid any press questions, knowing reporters would have pointed to her many full-throated, pro-congestion pricing statements and questioned her rank hypocrisy.\nHochul’s about-face — driven not by her concern for middle class drivers as she unconvincingly suggests, but to curry favor with suburban voters in anticipation of her 2026 reelection bid — is one of the most cowardly and craven collapses of political courage New Yorkers have had the misfortune to witness. It’s breathtaking and downright unseemly.\nIt was an extraordinarily reckless and irresponsible show of governing, given the MTA’s acute funding needs and her fiduciary obligations. As state Sen. Liz Krueger tweeted , “The governor has stated that she has a billion dollars in funding to replace congestion pricing as a funding source for this year, but as Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, I am not aware of what she is referring to or where she thinks that money will come from.” Krueger goes on to say, that the “Legislature will certainly not be rushing to raise taxes on hard-working New York City residents and small businesses.”\nHochul has nonetheless conjured up a new proposal she’s tucked into an omnibus bill, aptly called the “Big Ugly,” that she’s going to try to ram through the Legislature now. Her big idea is to increase the Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) on New York City businesses, including small businesses, while letting the suburban voters she’s pandering to off scot-free.\nWhat’s missing from her proposal are all the benefits of congestion pricing: less traffic, less asthma, quicker response times for emergency vehicles, fewer injuries and fatalities caused by too many cars and trucks on our local streets — in other words, all things that would greatly improve the quality of life for everyone. Congestion pricing is also a leading strategy to reduce the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere, which continues to heat the planet.\nThe governor chose politics (i.e., her own reelection prospects) over people’s lives, health and safety. She chose to protect the interest of thousands of wealthy suburban drivers over the transit needs of eight million everyday New Yorkers. She chose burning more fossil fuel over burning less and reducing New York’s carbon footprint, revealing her clearly fraudulent commitment to tackling climate change.\nThe Legislature must say no to Hochul’s gutless proposal that will impose a financial burden on our small businesses while doing nothing to improve the habitability of our city. To be clear, it’s not just the MTA funding the advocates (100-plus groups that make up the Congestion Pricing Now coalition) are after, it’s congestion pricing itself, with its myriad and substantial benefits for all New Yorkers, including drivers. Anything less will go down in history as an epic failure.\nEven New Yorkers who were against congestion pricing should be appalled by the governor’s flip-flop. Who wants a governor who caves so easily to pressure and selfishly chooses to expand her suburban vote rather than serve the ten million New Yorkers who would have benefited from the program?\nHochul doubled down on her hypocrisy when she released a press statement featuring tired and discredited talking points from a dozen or so long-time congestion pricing haters, mostly from the suburbs. New York City residents take notice: it’s white, wealthy, campaign-donating, suburbanites she aims to serve, not the likes of us city dwellers, whom she takes for granted as being reliable Democratic votes.\nThe governor deserves a mountain of scorn for her short-sighted and small-minded stunt and has just made herself politically vulnerable. After this debacle, I’m guessing that a more progressive slate of Democrats, ready to lead the state into a truly sustainable future, will come forward to challenge her in 2026.\nAt this time of national uncertainty and global climate chaos, New York needs leadership, not an indecisive panderer who doesn’t know what she thinks from one day to the next.\nMatthiessen is an environmental advocate and consultant who led the Move NY congestion pricing campaign from 2010-19, which led to the enactment of the program in 2019.",

    "title": "The world's glaciers are melting faster than we thought, new research shows",
    "text": "Glaciers have survived through a delicate balance of gain and loss. A new study shows just how much the scale has tipped. In 1971, researchers made a surprising discovery while studying Greenland's ice: Temperatures over the island spiked by very large amounts within short periods thousands of years ago. The finding showed that abrupt warming could happen over just several decades and changed how they thought about natural climate change. Today, the world is the in the grips of another major shift, this time due to anthropogenic activities. And scientists are making predictions about how ice will soon evolve as [temperatures] warm. In a new study published today in the journal The Cryosphere , researchers modeled how much glaciers will melt by the year 2100. The results show that more ice will disappear than what's predicted in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, generally considered the scientific consensus on the state of climate change. \"We have a field program on a glacier in Switzerland, where we go back and see how much has melted, and the changes are absolutely massive,\" says lead author and glaciologist Harry Zekollari at ETH Zurich and Vrije Universiteit Brussel. The vast majority of the world's 200,000 glaciers are also showing clear signs of warming, thinning between three and six feet per year, on average. Predicting the future flow of glaciers Simply tallying the annual losses for each glacier to predict how much ice will be left wouldn't result in accurate predictions. \"Because of the way glaciers flow, they respond to climate in a non-linear way,\" says glaciologist Lizz Ultee at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, who was not involved in the study. To account for this, Zekollari and his colleagues used two computer models to simulate the complex physics of how glaciers move and change in mass. They first ran the models for the [years between 2000 and 2019], fine-tuning the parameters to best-match [the predicted changes in mass to actual ones. The latter were first documented in] a paper published in 2021. \"We now have satellite observations for every glacier in the world that we used to calibrate our models,\" says coauthor and hydrologist Rodrigo Aguayo also of Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Then, the team ran the simulations forward up to the end of the century using climate scenarios based on how well the world reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The results show that, globally, between about a quarter and one-half of the volume of glaciers will be lost by the year 2100, depending on the amount of warming. For instance, if net zero emissions are achieved around mid-century, the lower estimate would apply, while continued emissions at present levels or even higher amounts, progressively result in the higher estimates. Last month, the United Nations published the most recent [Emissions Gap Report, 2024](about:blank), which suggests that the world is headed for somewhere in the middle for emissions, if countries don’t switch to cleaner energy quickly enough. The team also calculated glacial losses at smaller-scales, which in many cases were higher. “Some regions are committed to become almost entirely ice free even with limited warming,” says Zekollari. This includes glaciers located in Western Canada, the U.S., east South Asia, and central Europe. What happens when glaciers disappear? The losses could also have profound impacts on people who depend on glaciers for water. Aguayo notes that the percentages of ice volume lost don't necessarily translate into how much water supply could be reduced by. \"It could be worse,\" he says, noting that meltwater could be significantly reduced during dry periods in certain catchments where communities rely on them for drinking water. People not living near glaciers could also be affected through sea level rise. The world’s glaciers hold about a foot of sea level rise and have already raised sea levels by around half-an-inch during the past 20 years. \"It doesn't seem like much,\" says glaciologist Catherine Walker at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who wasn’t involved in the study. But she adds: “If you start thinking about the physical realities at a place with a 10-foot-plus storm-surge, I think you would rather not have a foot more coming in from all these glaciers melting.” The team's results are similar to [predictions from a glacier model](about:blank) that researchers used last year. The previous model was also tuned using the same glacier-specific data under the most recent climate scenarios. “We now have more confidence in the numbers we can provide to policymakers,” says Zekollari. Another advantage of the new models is their ability to make predictions at a variety of scales. “The fact that they could model both the global scale and tell what will happen to individual glaciers is amazing,” says Walker. Warming continues after 2100 Zekollari says that even though the study focused on predicting up to the end of the century, glaciers can take much longer to fully respond. “It’s clear that on a longer-term, we’ll be losing way more,” he says. Ultee points out that fjords in Greenland already show hundreds of feet of recent ice loss. “It’s really striking to see,” she adds. And, elsewhere, glacial ice has disappeared, leaving behind desolate scenes of rocky debris. For glaciers, which have otherwise managed to persist for thousands of years through a delicate balance of gain and loss, the changes are also extraordinary. “Glaciers are not a permanent feature of the landscape,” says Ultee. “They can change really fast over human timescales and we can see it happening.",
