    "title": "2nd Amendment victory: Appeals court restores right to carry in California",
    "text": "by WorldTribune Staff / [247 Real News](https://www.worldtribune.com/category/breaking/) January 7, 2024 A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel has blocked a new California law, SB-2, that bans people from carrying firearms in most public places. A three-judge panel on Saturday dissolved a temporary hold on a lower court injunction blocking the law. The hold was issued by a different 9th Circuit panel and had allowed the law to go into effect on Jan. 1. Saturday’s decision keeps in place a Dec. 20 ruling by U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney blocking the law. Carney said that it violates the Second Amendment and that gun rights groups would likely prevail in proving it unconstitutional. The stay had allowed the Democrats in power in California to implement dozens of expansive “gun-free” zones at the beginning of the year, including one on every piece of private property unless the owner explicitly authorized gun carry. Critics said the cumulative effect of the new “sensitive places” restrictions in the law added up to an effective ban on gun carry. “The right to carry in California was unconstitutionally eliminated for almost a week,” Kostas Moros, a lawyer for plaintiffs California Pistol and Rifle Association, told The Reload. “We are relieved the status quo has been restored and Californians with CCW permits, who are among the most law-abiding people there are, can resume carrying as they have for years.” Carney found SB2 “unconstitutionally deprive” permitholders “of their constitutional right to carry a handgun in public for self-defense.” He further accused California of intentionally ignoring and undermining the Supreme Court’s decision in 2022’s New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, which established carrying a gun for self-defense is protected by the Constitution. “SB2’s coverage is sweeping, repugnant to the Second Amendment, and openly defiant of the Supreme Court,” Carney, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote. “The law designates twenty-six categories of places, such as hospitals, public transportation, places that sell liquor for on-site consumption, playgrounds, parks, casinos, stadiums, libraries, amusement parks, zoos, places of worship, and banks, as ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry permitholders cannot carry their handguns. SB2 turns nearly every public place in California into a ‘sensitive place,’ effectively abolishing the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding and exceptionally qualified citizens to be armed and to defend themselves in public.” The panel could still reconsider part of the stay before arguments in the case are actually heard. Those arguments are currently scheduled to occur in April.

    "text": "The Salish Sea’s frigid waters don’t typically seem inviting during winter, but on New Year’s Day, many people across Vancouver Island are brave enough to make a splash. Several Island communities organized polar bear swim events to help those who wish to shock their body with cold water to start 2024 off on the right foot. In Sidney, approximately 1,000 people showed up to either spectate or participate in the polar bear swim. Christina Lech from the Peninsula Celebration Society hoped the event would show people that it’s not as hard as it looks to take the plunge. “You actually feel amazing coming out of the water. It’s hard to breathe when you are in the water, but when you do come out, you feel like a million bucks,” exclaimed Lech.

Despite cold temperatures, it didn’t stop organizer Karine Godbout from organizing the swim out on Dallas Point Road in Victoria. “My core group of swimmers is about 15 people, so to have that many people is awesome. I think it’s the best way to start the new year,” Godbout told CHEK News. “If you had a little bit too much of a drink last night or too much partying, you can start fresh with the cold water.” Other polar bear swims on and around the Island were organized in Port Alberni, Nanaimo and Parksville, as well as near the Cowichan River and on Pender Island. Polar bear swims were also held [in communities across Canada](https://www.cheknews.ca/canadians-across-country-expected-to-celebrate-new-years-day-with-polar-bear-swim-1184046/).",
