    "title": "Hospitals in Multiple Blue States Bring Back Mask Mandates As Fear of 'Quad-Demic' Spreads",
    "text": "In this episode of \"It Feels Like Déjà Vu All Over Again\"...\nDespite multiple extensive and conclusive reports that mask mandates and other ridiculous COVID pandemic mandates were sometimes worse than worthless (more, later) hospitals in multiple blue states are bringing back mask mandates as \"experts\" fear a coming \"quad-demic.\" Scary sounding, huh?\nThe so-called \"quad-demic\" consists of the flu, COVID, RSV, and Norovirus.\nAccording to a\n[Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14210119/mutiple-states-face-mask-rules-pandemic-virus-winter.html) report, the incidence of COVID is \"low\" nationally but on the rise, with 4 percent infections in early November rising to 5.4 percent during the week of December 7, with hospital admissions for flu-like respiratory illnesses increasing 14 percent in the two-week period through the week of December 7.\nDr. Joe Bresee, an infectious diseases expert, told Daily Mail:\nWe know these viruses are coming. We see them increase every year. We are in store for increases in circulation in these four over the next couple of months and that would cause what we call epidemics [outbreaks].\nGot it. But here's something else we also know (emphasis, mine):\nDespite overwhelming evidence that mask mandates do not prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Biden administration forced Americans to wear masks while using public transportation systems, such as airlines.\nIt also required masks for many federal workers and for citizens entering government buildings. This continued until 2022 — two years after the pandemic began and long after government health data had shown mask mandates do not work.\nAgain, as New York Yankee great Yogi Berra liked to say, it feels like déjà vu, all over again.\nREAD MORE:\n[NEW: How the Biden Administration Spent Hundreds of Millions on 'Misinformation' Research Is 'Disturbing'](https://redstate.com/mike_miller/2024/12/09/new-biden-administration-spent-hundreds-of-millions-taxpayer-dollars-on-misinformation-research-n2182975)\nCOVID hysteria during the so-called \"pandemic\" led to mandates that not only had zero or little effect on the transmission of the coronavirus, but also led to adverse unintended consequences, caused by \"experts\" who either lied or didn't have a clue about what they pushed. School lockdowns come to mind as a prime example.\nDespite the realities we learned from the pandemic, as Daily Mail reported:\n- RWJBarnabas Health, New Jersey's largest hospital system, announced Monday anyone walking through their doors needs a mask, possibly a hospital-supplied covering.\n- Several counties in San Franciso began mask mandates last month that run through April 30, 2025.\n- New York City officials last month recommended masks on public transportation.\nOne conclusive report, published by the Cochrane Institute in January 2023,\n[found](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full) \"uncertainty about the effects of face masks.\" Cochrane analyzed 78 global studies involving more than one million people.\nThe pooled results … did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks. There were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection.\nMoreover, top scientists in Holland\n[reported](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8583925/The-land-no-face-masks-Hollands-scientists-say-theres-no-solid-evidence-coverings-work.html#) in August 2020 that there was no solid evidence that masks and other face coverings were effective against the virus and could even damage the fight against COVID:\n\"Face masks in public places are not necessary, based on all the current evidence,\" said Coen Berends, spokesman for the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. \"There is no benefit and there may even be negative impact.\"\nIn another study, researchers at the University of East Anglia in May found that\n[masks' protective effect seemed to disappear](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13421975/Wearing-face-masks-reduce-risk-COVID.html) in February 2022.\nYet here we — make that \"they,\" as in Democrat-dominated states — go again. The question is how many rational people will comply.\nHere's more from Daily Mail's piece, linked above:\n[RWJBarnabas Health], which which treats 3 million patients per year, said Monday that staff will provide new masks for everyone who walks in the door and '\"may ask you to replace your own mask with a hospital-supplied mask\" as part of the mandate.\nRWJBarnabas Health said masks at outpatient facilities like doctors' offices are not currently required but are \"strongly encouraged.\"\nMeanwhile, hospitals in New York have also urged patients, staff and visitors to mask while indoors and get vaccinated against Covid and the flu as rates have \"really plummeted.\"\nAnd last month, New York City health officials recommended masking up on public transport as winter temperatures set in.\nIt's hard to imagine that tens of millions of Americans would put up with another round of mask mandates or any other virus related mandates, which reminds me of the old admonition about \"the boy who cried wolf.\"\nYeah, let's not go back there.",

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for.\nDuring a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral.\n\"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\"\nThe day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down.\nHosek wouldn't hear of it.\n\"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\"\n'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her\nCustomer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance.\nNoticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\"\n\"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said.\nIn a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners.\nChappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit.\n\"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\"\nOwner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so.\nThe \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of.\nThe two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact.\nChappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family.\n\"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.\n1-cent Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger's are available at Wendy's this week. Here's how to get one.

    "text": "For many years, Australia's Pilbara region has been a symbol of rapid growth and prosperity in the mining industry. Located in Western Australia, it has served as the country's main economic engine for decades, drawing on its rich iron ore reserves. Huge piles of crushed brown rock, up to 200,000 tons each, ready to be shipped to Asian steel mills were a common sight at the port of Parker Point. However, today, according to an expert in the field of metallurgy, Stanislav Kondrashov, the region is facing new challenges: the fading of the Chinese infrastructure boom and the need to transition to more environmentally friendly technologies.\nStanislav Kondrashov: fading Chinese demand for iron ore and its impact on the Pilbara economy\nChina, which consumes about 85% of Australia's iron ore, has a huge impact on the economy of the Pilbara, a region that has long been the main source of this raw material. However, recent trends in the Chinese economy and real estate sector are beginning to put pressure on this traditional export route.\nAccording to Stanislav Kondrashov from Telf AG, demand for steel in China has been stable and high for a long time, but now it is approaching its peak. China's steel production is expected to peak before the end of the current decade. This is largely due to a slowdown in the real estate sector, which is one of the largest consumers of steel in the country.\nThe crisis in China's real estate sector, which traditionally used much of its steel production, has led to a decrease in demand for steel. This in turn impacts Australian iron ore import requirements, inevitably leading to lower export earnings for the Pilbara.\nWith demand for iron ore falling in China, the Pilbara economy faces a number of challenges. Since the region is heavily dependent on iron ore exports, Stanislav Kondrashov from Telf AG is confident that it is necessary to look for alternative markets or develop other sectors of the economy to compensate for possible losses:\nTo overcome these challenges, the region will need to diversify its economic activities. This could include developing other sectors such as tourism or renewable energy, as well as finding new markets for iron ore exports outside China .\nStanislav Kondrashov: environmental challenges and innovations\nModern steel production, which has not changed since the 14th century, is a high-carbon process. In search of a solution to this problem, alternative technologies are being developed, such as electric arc furnaces and direct reduction of iron using natural gas. According to Stanislav Kondrashov, in the long term it is planned to use “green” hydrogen, which will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the steel production process.\nTypical Australian iron ore has an iron content of between 56% and 62%, making it less suitable for new technologies without further processing. This could increase costs by 25%, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Such changes will inevitably impact the competitiveness of the Australian iron ore industry in the global market.\nIn the face of these challenges, the Australian iron ore industry must adapt, not only technologically but also strategically. This requires innovation, rethinking production processes and possibly diversifying markets. The road ahead is difficult, but it is precisely periods like these that often become an effective catalyst for major industrial and economic transformations, - Kondrashov says. Reimagining the future of Australia's iron ore industry is not just a necessity, but an opportunity for innovation and sustainable development. The Pilbara and the entire Australian iron ore industry now stand on the threshold of a new era that will determine their place in the global economy of the future.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Telf AG\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: Switzerland\nWebsite: https://telf.ch/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "En la lucha contra las drogas que dirige la Agencia de Control de Drogas (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés) pocos hechos han destacado tanto como la sentencia interpuesta en contra de Joaquín ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, exlíder del Cártel de Sinaloa que actualmente cumple una cadena perpetua en la prisión de mayor seguridad de Estados Unidos. Es por ello que la agencia exhibe dos artículos personales del capo detrás de una vitrina, con el objetivo de recordar que los crímenes atroces de los que el capo fue responsable fueron castigados. [Te puede interesar: “Cualquier cosa que ‘El Mayo’ haga, está bien”: la vez que ‘El Chapo’ aceptó que su socio asesinara a su compadre](/mexico/2024/01/24/cualquier-cosa-que-el-mayo-haga-esta-bien-la-vez-que-el-chapo-acepto-que-su-socio-asesinara-a-su-compadre/) De acuerdo con datos del gobierno de EEUU, ambos objetos se encuentran resguardados en el Museo y Centro de Visitantes de la DEA, mismo que se encuentra ubicado en el condado de Arlington, Virginia, y que exhibe de forma gratuita distintos objetos relevantes en la historia de la lucha contra el narcotráfico. El primer artículo de ‘El Chapo’ ingresó a este recinto en 2018. Se trata del uniforme de prisionero que vestía en México antes de su extradición al vecino norte, un conjunto de una chamarra y un pantalón color caqui que luce el número 3912. Fotografías de su llegada a Nueva York el 20 de enero de 2017 confirman que el otrora narcotraficante vestía dichas prendas. Poco después le fue entregado el clásico uniforme carcelario de color naranja que se utiliza en EEUU. [Te puede interesar: ¿'El Chapo’ Guzmán ya se había retirado del Cártel de Sinaloa antes de ser capturado por última vez?](/mexico/2024/01/24/el-chapo-guzman-ya-se-habia-retirado-del-cartel-de-sinaloa-antes-de-ser-capturado-por-ultima-vez/) En la descripción del artículo, la DEA escribió: “Llevará un uniforme de prisión sencillo y corriente como este por el resto de su vida”. [Te puede interesar: Así fue el encuentro entre ‘El Mayo’ Zambada y ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán tras su primera fuga](/mexico/2024/01/24/asi-fue-el-encuentro-entre-el-mayo-zambada-y-el-chapo-guzman-tras-su-primera-fuga/) Junto a él descansa un segundo objeto que perteneció a Guzmán Loera: una pistola bañada en oro y con incrustaciones de diamantes. La pistola Beretta de ‘El Chapo’ El arma que alguna vez perteneció al capo fue ingresada al museo el 21 de febrero de 2020. Se trata de una pistola Beretta 92 F 9MM Parabellum de 40 centímetros de longitud. Está chapada en oro, tiene incrustaciones de diamantes y cuenta con un silenciador. De acuerdo con la DEA, el arma fue encontrada en una de las casas de seguridad que ‘El Chapo’ utilizaba para esconderse de las autoridades, antes de que su trayectoria criminal llegara a su fin. “Es posible que Guzmán haya hecho hacer la pistola a medida para sus dos hijos”, se lee en la descripción. Aunque la colección en línea no incluye ningún otro artículo, destaca que en la sección de ‘El Chapo’ [hay un tercer objeto](https://www.infobae.com/mexico/2023/09/01/estas-son-las-lujosas-armas-del-chapo-y-caro-quintero-que-la-dea-expone-en-su-museo-fotos/). Se trata de un peculiar rifle Mak-90 que también perteneció al narcotraficante y que fue decomisado en la misma casa de seguridad que la primera. Ésta última arma fue fabricada por la empresa Norinco y cuenta con decoraciones de oro y patrones de grecas, ornamento utilizado en Grecia. En la exhibición la DEA también recuerda que Guzmán Loera amasó miles de millones de dólares traficando drogas a EEUU, además de haber sido responsable de delitos como secuestro, tortura y el homicidio de cientos de personas. La camisa de ‘El Chapo’ que fue enmarcada Adicional a los objetos personales ya descritos, en 2019 se dio a conocer que Raymond P. Donovan, entonces agente encargado de la delegación de la DEA en Nueva York, mando a enmarcar la playera de prisionero que ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán vestía en México para colocarla en su oficina. El marco que la resguarda también incluye datos importantes en la historia del narcotraficante, así como fotografías.

    "text": "Что известно о блокировке звонков в Telegram и WhatsApp В РКН заявили, что ограничение голосовых звонков связано с профилактикой мошенничества\nРоскомнадзор (РКН) блокирует звонки через Telegram и WhatsApp (принадлежит Meta, которая признана экстремистской и запрещена в России). В ведомстве заявили, что решение связано с профилактикой мошенничества. Собрали, что известно об ограничении.\nПричина Популярные мессенджеры стали «основными голосовыми сервисами, используемыми для обмана и вымогательства денег, вовлечения в диверсионную и террористическую деятельность российских граждан», пояснили РБК в пресс-службе ведомства.\nРКН утверждает, что мессенджеры не обеспечивают достаточную безопасность пользователей и не выполняют требования российского законодательства по борьбе с мошенничеством.\nОтмечается, что ограничение коснулось только звонков, а остальные функции мессенджеров остаются доступными.\nГенеральный директор Telecom Daily Денис Кусков рассказал «Ведомостям», что частичная блокировка будет проявляться как «бульканье», шипение и помехи во время разговора.\nКогда снимут ограничения «Известия» со ссылкой на Минцифры РФ пишут , что доступ к голосовым звонкам будет восстановлен, когда иностранные платформы начнут соблюдать российское законодательство и подключатся к борьбе с противоправными действиями.\nОт владельцев мессенджеров требуют предоставлять данные по запросу правоохранительных органов, если имеются подозрения в совершении массовых случаев мошенничества и в планировании терактов на территории России. В ведомстве подчеркнули, что, когда такую информацию запрашивают иностранные спецслужбы, мессенджеры сотрудничают с ними, но в случае с РФ отказываются.\nРеакция В ответ на ограничения в Telegram отметили, что каждый пользователь может выбирать, от кого принимать звонки, или полностью отключать их. В компании также заявили, что они активно борются с вредоносным контентом, сообщает РБК.\nПредставители второго мессенджера заявили, что их приложение защищено сквозным шифрованием и «противостоит попыткам правительств нарушить право людей на безопасное общение». Именно с этим сервис связывает решение властей ограничить доступ к функциям мессенджера.\nСейчас WhatsApp (принадлежит Meta, которая признана экстремистской и запрещена в России) и Telegram являются самыми популярными интернет-ресурсами у россиян.
