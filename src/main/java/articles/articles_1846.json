    "text": "Aviation unions have deferred their planned strike action, citing “positive developments” in ongoing talks over improved remuneration for workers.\nThe strike, which was scheduled to begin on Monday, August 11, was put on hold following the intervention of the Minister of Aviation and senior ministry officials, as well as efforts by the management of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA).\nIn a joint notice, the unions under NAMA said they had earlier been “compelled by unfavourable circumstances” to reinforce their strike notice but have now resolved to suspend the action pending further developments.\n“Now, however, due to the hard work of the Management of NAMA and the intervention of the Honourable Minister of Aviation and other senior officials of the Ministry, we are happy to report that there have been some positive developments around the issue,” the statement read.\nThe notice was signed by AbdulRasaq Saidu, Secretary General of the Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP); Odinaka Igbokwe, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE); Frances Akinjole, Principal Deputy General Secretary of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN); and Alo Lawrence, General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPCTRE).\nThe unions highlighted the release of a “no objection” letter from the Budget Office to the National Incomes, Salaries and Wages Commission on August 7, and a follow-up letter from NAMA management to its staff outlining ongoing efforts to ensure payment of the new remuneration along with August salaries.\n“Based on the above, and in order to demonstrate good faith, our unions have taken the decision to defer the strike action scheduled to commence on Monday 11th August, 2025 pending the state of affairs on the subject matter at the end of August, 2025,” the statement added.",

    "text": "Department of Public Health, downtown business partner to feed those in need AUGUSTA, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - Toaste of Augusta on Broad Street operates mainly as a brunch spot downtown, but owner Dominick Cantrel has always looked to do more. That’s why they’re partnering to serve free food with the Department of Public Health on the last business day of the month for the next two years. “Whoever needs to help what we’re gonna do we’re gonna do what we got to do to help,” said Cantrel. Cantrel also provides a service called “God’s Grits,” where every month he opens his restaurant up to whoever needs a plate of food at no cost and no questions asked. “My mom always told me if I have the means to help someone, do it without asking for anything in advance or asking anything in return, and I live on it. So I feel like there’s more people that need my help and I’m more than willing to help,” he said. Through “God’s Grits”, he serves 50 to 75 people monthly. During the first event with the Department of Public Health, he served more than 250 people. “I was a little overwhelmed because I didn’t know that it was just that many folks that needed assistance. I mean, you think you know, but you don’t know,” he said. “That’s probably just barely touching the surface.” With Project Refresh on the last business day of every month, Cantrel will be ready to serve those who need it. “How many more folks that are too afraid to come to you and say, ‘Hey, I need help.’ You know, this is an open event to the community,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what your situation is, you’re more than welcome. It touched my heart, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve definitely got a warm, fuzzy space in my heart for it.” Cantrel also says that combining forces with the Department of Public Health, allows more people to know about “God’s Grits”.

    "title": "OpenAI planea crear un navegador web con IA para competir con Google",
    "text": "Semana de malas noticias para Google. Si el miércoles supo que el Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos quiere obligarla a vender el negocio de Chrome para acabar con su monopolio, el jueves se filtró que OpenAI, su rival y fabricante de ChatGPT, estudia la posibilidad de desarrollar un navegador web propio para desbancarla. Según publica The Information, la start-up de inteligencia artificial financiada por Microsoft se plantea crear un producto de navegación por Internet que combinaría con su chatbot, si bien esa posibilidad está aún lejos de materializarse. Con este movimiento, OpenAI podría tratar de plantar cara a Google. Chrome es el navegador más popular del mundo, pues concentra un 67% de ese mercado, según datos de Statcounter, muy por delante de rivales como Safari, Edge o Firefox. Competir con Google es una misión titánica, pero eso podría cambiar si la justicia estadounidense termina obligando a la compañía a desprenderse de su navegador. Ambas noticias han hecho que la capitalización de Google se resienta en bolsa. En las últimas 24 horas, sus acciones se han devaluado un 4,56%. No es la primera vez que OpenAI reta a Google. A finales de julio, la empresa capitaneada por Sam Altman anunció el lanzamiento de SearchGPT, el prototipo de un motor de búsqueda que se sirve de IA para dar respuesta a las consultas de los usuarios. Un año antes, Microsoft integró esa tecnología en su buscador Bing y en su navegador Edge a través de Copilot, un asistente conversacional que acompaña al usuario durante la navegación web. El dominio de Google en ese campo es aún más abrumador, pues su servicio concentra casi el 90% del mercado mundial de las búsquedas web. Aun así, las maniobras de Microsoft y OpenAI han obligado a Google a mover ficha. A finales de 2023, el gigante tecnológico dirigido por Sundar Pichai lanzó su propio modelo de IA, Gemini, y lo integró a sus servicios para tratar de mejorar las búsquedas y neutralizar a sus rivales. OpenAI también está buscando otras fórmulas para ganar terreno a Google. Según The Information, la firma está estudiando la posibilidad de potenciar las funciones de IA en los móviles y tabletas fabricados por la surcoreana Samsung, tradicional socio comercial de Google. En junio, la creadora de ChatGPT anunció una nueva alianza para alimentar los dispositivos de Apple, que cobra unos 12.000 millones de dólares anuales de Google para que su navegador y su buscador estén instalados por defecto.",
