    "text": "(Reuters) – Kazakhstan-based fintech heavyweight Kaspi.kz disclosed a surge in profits and revenue for its most recent quarter on Thursday, when it took another step towards a U.S. listing by making its IPO paperwork public.\nThe company commands a valuation of nearly $19 billion on the London Stock Exchange, where its global depositary receipts are already listed.\nKaspi.kz joins several richly valued firms heading towards a U.S. listing in 2024. Social media giant Reddit, cloud security company Rubrik and software startup ServiceTitan are also expected to go public next year.\n“With a U.S. listing, we believe Kaspi.kz can reach a larger and more diverse investor base that will enjoy being with us for the next stage of our development,” co-founder and CEO Mikheil Lomtadze wrote in a letter attached to the IPO prospectus.\nNet income for the three months ended Sept. 30 was 232.49 billion Kazakh tenge ($512 million), up 40% from last year. In the same period, revenue grew nearly 51% to 508.44 billion Kazakh tenge.\nThe company’s payments, marketplace and fintech solutions cater to both consumers and merchants. Besides e-commerce purchases, its app also lets customers access buy now, pay later (BNPL) debt, renew their driving licenses and register their businesses.\nKaspi.kz did not disclose the number of shares it expects to sell in the IPO, but said its offer price would be similar to the trading price of its LSE-listed depositary receipts.\nIt has applied to list its American Depositary Shares (ADS) on the Nasdaq, the bourse where some of the biggest U.S. technology firms are traded.\nMorgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup are the lead underwriters for the IPO.\n(Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)",

    "text": "Thursday, December 28th 2023, 3:40 pm A fire in Southwest Oklahoma City leaves a ministry without an operational building. News 9 spoke with the director of Grace United Urban Ministries, and some volunteers as they worked to clean up the debris, and salvage what they could from the fire. “We gotta keep moving because we have people depending on us, and we save lives - that's what we do,” said Donna Heins. Donna Heins runs Grace United Urban Ministries in south Oklahoma City, which provides services for those facing homelessness. She does what she can to help those living on the streets. “God, we have to figure out how we still feed people- that's just what I thought, even in this devastation,” said Heins. They serve around 40 people most days, but between their Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, they fed more than 700 people in need. “There's some good people on the street - and we're all just a paycheck away these days and times from being homeless,” said Heins. But her mission was interrupted last night when her building caught on fire. Oklahoma City firefighters responded around 6 p.m. on Wednesday, after the apartment above the ministry caught fire. The building that housed Grace United mostly just suffered water and smoke damage, but Heins says there was too much damage to save the building. But Donna's first thought wasn't fear or panic when she heard about the fire. She was immediately thinking about how she would continue her mission, even with the interruption. “I always know that God makes a way out of no way. I've seen it my whole life and that's how I tell my homeless people, you may be here today, but tomorrow if you make the right decision, you could be in a different place,” said Heins. Some of the people that Donna has helped through the years were at the building this morning to help clean up the damage and debris. “I've been on the streets for like 20 years and about a year ago she asked me to get off the street, I've been helping her ever since then,” said William Beaver. Beaver was moved into temporary housing after he decided he no longer wanted to live a life on the streets. “Last year when we did the emergency shelter, he said ‘I don't wanna go back to the street’ and I said, ‘Well come on home with us Beaver!’” said Heins “He's doing amazing, we're reuniting him with his mom and his family so he came to help today.” Now Beaver is returning the favor, helping Donna, like she helped him. “That's what it's all about, watching people change and do something different with their life,” said Heins. While there’s not much left for them to salvage, Donna says they will keep moving forward. “All I know is God is always with us, he has a plan,” said Heins. “We made it through the holidays, now we just gotta make it through the new year and it's just gonna be another adventure.” Oklahoma City firefighters are still working to determine the cause of the fire, but they do say it started in the apartment upstairs, above the building, and they say luckily nobody was hurt. Heins says they are now looking for a new building to rent, and she is hoping to stay in the Southwest OKC / Capitol Hill area.

    "text": "Supreme Court rejects controversial Purdue Pharma bankruptcy deal Updated June 27, 2024 at 13:55 PM ET The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday invalidated a controversial bankruptcy deal involving Purdue Pharma, maker of the highly addictive painkiller Oxycontin, and members of the Sackler family who owned the scandal-plagued drug firm. By a vote of 5-4, the justices threw out the bankruptcy settlement, which has been valued at between $6 billion and $10 billion. Writing for the court majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch said U.S. bankruptcy law doesn't afford bankruptcy courts the kind of power needed to block lawsuits against parties who haven't filed for bankruptcy. \"The bankruptcy code does not authorize a release and injunction that, as part of a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11, effectively seek to discharge claims against a non-debtor without the consent of affected claimants,\" he wrote. Gorsuch added that if Congress intended to grant this level of power to bankruptcy courts, it might have done so. Writing for the dissenters, Justice Brett Kavanugh said the ruling disrupts a deal that would have funneled money to communities and victims of the opioid crisis. \"Today's decision is wrong on the law and devastating for more than 100,000 opioid victims and their families,\" Kavanaugh wrote. The bankruptcy deal would have provided roughly $8 billion to state and local governments for dealing with the consequences of opioid addiction; it also would have provided individual compensation to victims. Most of the settlement would have been funded by members of the Sackler family who owned and ran Purdue Pharma, and [agreed to pay $6 billion](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/03/1084163626/purdue-sacklers-oxycontin-settlement) into the compensation pot. In exchange, the Sacklers would have been shielded from personal liability even though six Sackler family members served on the company’s the board — including Chairman Richard Sackler, who closely directed the firm’s aggressive and deceptive marketing strategy for Oxycontin as a painkiller that was not addictive. Ultimately, 95% of the victims who sued Purdue Pharma agreed to the bankruptcy settlement. But the remaining 5% objected, contending the bankruptcy court exceeded its authority in allowing the Sacklers to hold on to half their wealth and escape further liability. The deal was also opposed by the U.S. Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog agency. But on Thursday the Supreme Court tossed out the deal. Experts say the decision will have far-reaching implications for an overdose crisis that still kills more than 100,000 people in the U.S. every year. Copyright 2024 NPR",

    "text": "Five-Star Plus+ OT David Sanders Jr. reflects on signing with Tennessee\nCharlotte Providence Day Five-Star Plus+ offensive tackle David Sanders Jr. kept Tennessee fans on the edge of their seats by not putting pen to paper on National Signing Day.\nOhio State had been pushing hard in the dying embers of his recruitment, so when reports circulated that he wouldn’t be announced by the Volunteers on Wednesday, rumors continued to swirl about a potential flip to Columbus.\nSanders put everything to bed on Thursday afternoon, announcing that he was signing with Josh Heupel and Co. in an appearance on The Paul Finebaum Show.\n“Tennessee has been in it from the very beginning. They offered me as a freshman in high school and they’ve been kind of on me every year since then — expressing to me that I was a priority in their class and a must-get for the class of 2025,” Sanders told Finebaum about his decision.\n“Coach Heupel has expressed to me many times that I’m the leader of this class and he wants me to come in and really lead them along with our quarterback and the other recruits that we have as well. Tennessee did a great job recruiting me. The recruiting class they have coming in, I feel like we have a great mix of guys. We have a great quarterback, great receivers, a good defensive corps and other offensive linemen as well along with myself.”\nOhio State finished No. 2 in the race for Sanders\nRyan Day and the Buckeyes never quit in their pursuit of Sanders and even got him back to Columbus for a visit two weeks ago. The likes of Georgia, Clemson and South Carolina were also involved heavily in his recruitment back in the summer, but it was Tennessee and Ohio State that emerged as the top contenders.\nSanders committed to UT on Aug. 17. The Buckeyes worked hard to come out on top, but the 6-foot-5.75, 275-pounder is Knoxville bound.\n[Top 10](/)\n1BreakingBill Belichick\nNFL legend interviews at UNC\n2TrendingUrban Meyer\nAddressing OSU rumors\n3Bevo's status\nTexas mascot not attending SEC title\n4HotBottle throwing\nTexas can't identify culprits\n5Eric Bieniemy\nUCLA fires OC\n[View All](/)\n“When I picked (Tennessee) in August, Ohio State was right behind them. So, I felt like it was only right to maybe give them one more shot just to make sure I had made my decision and this was firm on where I wanted to be,” Sanders said about the recent visit to OSU. “I appreciate their coaching staff just like I appreciate the Tennessee coaching staff because they did a phenomenal job recruiting me as well.”\nHeupel was instrumental in Tennessee’s push\nIt’s no surprise that the head coach played a major role in a major recruitment, but Heupel stuck out to Sanders and his family. The nation’s No. 6 recruit took a slew of visits this summer and fall, seeing myriad coaching staffs across the country.\nAuthenticity with Heupel stood out in a big way for the five-star.\n“When you you’re going through the recruitment process, you get a lot of fake energy from a lot of coaches, I feel like sometimes, but I feel like he was very authentic on who he was. He didn’t change from the very first time I met him until now,” Sanders said. “And then, just getting to talk to the current players on the team, it doesn’t seem like he’s going to change once I get there. You know? He shows you who he is, and if you don’t like that, then you probably won’t go to Tennessee.”\nSanders headlines Tennessee’s 2025 recruiting class — which ranks No. 10 in the On3 Industry Team Recruiting Rankings.",

O esquema foi desmantelado em investigação do Gaeco (Grupo de Atuação Especial de Repressão ao Crime Organizado), que deflagrou a Operação Last Chat com alvos membros do grupo, que eram policiais militares, advogados e servidor público. No total, 29 pessoas foram presas.\nTodos que receberam dinheiro da empresa de fachada criada especialmente para fazer a l avagem de dinheiro do tráfico de drogas feito pela organização estão sendo ouvidos entre esta quinta e sexta- feira na sede do Gaeco, em Campo Grande .\nConforme o advogado Francisco Romero, que atua na defesa de Aldair Antônio Garcia, houve quebra de sigilo fiscal da empresa e todos que receberam quantias estão sendo ouvidos. Inclusive, quatro ex-namoradas de Rafael da Silva Lemos, conhecido como ‘Gazela', que está encarcerado em penitenciária, mas continuava a dar ordens para a organização na logística do transporte de drogas.\nO advogado Reinaldo Monteiro, que defende Kelli Letícia de Campos, apontada como dona da empresa de fachada, limitou-se a dizer que não teve acesso ao processo, mas que sua cliente é cozinheira e produz marmitas. Ainda conforme o defensor, os agentes não encontraram drogas ou armas na casa de Kelli, que está preso sob força de mandado de prisão.\nUm dos ‘laranjas', segundo as investigações do Gaeco, seria Sérgio Vinicius. O advogado dele, Selmen Dalloul, disse que Sérgio seria aposentado e que sequer teria dinheiro para pagar advogado. Ressaltou ainda que seu cliente “não tem participação com essa organização criminosa”.\nOutro advogado que acompanhava depoimento de sua cliente é Telmo César Lemos Gellen, que disse apenas que sua cliente é uma passadeira.\nAdvogada recebeu R$ 100 mil para obter informações sigilosas de policiais A advogada é apontada pela denúncia do Gaeco como a ponte entre o preso Rafael da Silva Lemos, conhecido como ‘Gazela', que está encarcerado em penitenciária, mas continuava a dar ordens para a organização na logística do transporte de drogas. Segundo a denúncia, uma empresa foi criada especialmente para fazer a lavagem de dinheiro do tráfico de drogas feito pela organização.\nA advogada que atuava como ‘gravata' para a organização criminosa ainda levantava informações sigilosas para Rafael. A denúncia traz que a advogada teria recebido da organização criminosa mais de R$ 100 mil. Sabe-se também que um dos integrantes da organização havia sido preso quando transportava drogas.\nMais de uma tonelada de maconha acabou apreendida e, depois da prisão do integrante, a advogada ficou incumbida de saber se corria riscos de outros endereços onde estavam armazenadas drogas serem descobertos pela polícia. Para isso, a advogada pagou para um policial militar descobrir informações e repassar a ela. Assim, posteriormente, informaria a Rafael, líder da organização.\nQuando o integrante da organização foi preso, ele e outro membro falavam sobre armas, munições e drogas que estariam em um depósito em uma casa na Rua Baraúnas, no bairro Parque dos Novos Estados. Depois de presos, a advogada teria instruído a não dar informações sobre a organização dificultando o trabalho da polícia.\nA advogada já havia sido presa quando da deflagração da Operação Courrier, em 2022, quando o Gaeco deflagrou a ação onde advogados estavam envolvidos com uma organização criminosa.\nConfira a lista dos presos: Anderson da Silva Ferreira, conhecido como ‘Ninho' Aldair Antonio Garcia Alex Benitez Gamarra Cleber Ferreira Alves Cybelle Bezerra da Silva Debora Cristina dos Santos Edson Ribeiro de Souza Fabiano Augusto Francisco Jales Francisco Moura Amorim Glenio Cesar da Costa Italo Eufrasio Lemos Jardeson Marx Teixeira Kelli Letícia de Campos Kelmo de Oliveira Klemerson Oliveira Lindisleir Aguilera do Nascimento Lucas Eric Ramires Luciana Lima Mayron Mendes Paula Tatiane Monezzi Rafael da Silva Lemos, o ‘Gazela' Renan Santana de Souza Ricardo Rodrigues Sérgio Simão Sérgio Vinicius Suelen Pereira Valdinei Freitas Viviane Fontoura Organização altamente estruturada A Operação Last Chat é para desmantelar organização criminosa altamente estruturada que opera no tráfico de drogas em cinco estados, desde o interior dos presídios, contando com uma rede sofisticada de distribuição e vários integrantes e apoiadores já identificados, cerca de 40 membros, entre eles policiais militares, servidor público municipal e três advogados.\nA organização criminosa também atuava no comércio ilegal de armas de grosso calibre, como fuzis e submetralhadoras, além de granadas, munições, acessórios e outros materiais bélicos de uso restrito, bem como na lavagem do dinheiro relacionado aos crimes, para a qual se utiliza de diferentes métodos, como a constituição de empresa fictícia, uso de contas bancárias de terceiros, aquisição de veículos de alto valor econômico em nome de terceiros – Porsche, caminhões, entre outros.",

    "text": "- By [Anushka Vats](/authors/anushka-vats) - Updated: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 03:50 PM (IST) - Source:JND A 41-year-old Indo-Canadian man has been arrested for many thefts and break-ins at Hindu temples located in the Durham Region and Greater Toronto Area of Canada, reported PTI, citing a police official. However, Durham Regional Police stated in a press release on Thursday that the offenses don't seem to be hate crimes or driven by hatred. The accused man has been identified as Jagdish Pandher from Brampton City. The incident took place in the early hours of October 8 and the police responded to a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. Pandher was caught on camera breaking into the temple and taking a huge sum of money from the donation boxes. He left the scene before the cops arrived, said the press release. He was \"seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,\" the release said. According to the police, the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year. \"These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,\" they said, as quoted by PTI. According to the release, Pandher is accused of breaking and entering on four separate occasions.
