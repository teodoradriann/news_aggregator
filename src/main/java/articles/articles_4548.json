Novos exames realizados recentemente apontaram a completa remissão do linfona não Hodking.\nPor conta do estado de saúde, Fuad Noman não compareceu à diplomação dos candidatos eleitos realizada pelo Tribunal Regional Eleitoral, nessa quarta-feira (18). Ele recebeu o diploma nesta quinta (19), mas também não esteve à sede do TRE. Coube ao procurador-geral de Belo Horizonte, Hércules Guerra, representá-lo na entrega do documento. Até então, a expectativa era de melhora e retorno presencial dele na prefeitura na próxima semana.\nApesar disso, Fuad usou as redes sociais para afirmar que \"recebeu com enorme alegria e honra do Tribunal Regional Eleitoral o diploma para mais um mandato à frente da Prefeitura\". Ele ressaltou que \"segue trabalhando e se recuperando bem para começar 2025 com muita energia e disposição\".\nMais recente Próxima Vale é determinada a realocar famílias que vivem em imóveis sob risco em Itabira (MG)",

    "title": "Proposal for Colorado school funding match focuses on rural districts - Chalkbeat",
    "text": "Sign up for Chalkbeat Colorado’s free daily newsletter to get the latest reporting from us, plus curated news from other Colorado outlets, delivered to your inbox.\nRural school districts that don’t generate much money from their community’s property taxes would be prioritized in changes to a state match program, letting those districts raise at least $200,000 when voters approve a new tax.\nThat’s one of the recommendations approved Wednesday by a working group tasked with proposing changes to Colorado’s state match program for mill levy overrides.\nOverrides provide local funding for schools when voters approve taxes on top of regular school funding taxes. Some Colorado districts have voter-approved overrides that give them the maximum allowed of extra funds, 25% or 30% more than their general funding. Other districts have never been able to get voters to approve an additional tax. In some communities, the reason districts don’t ask voters is because the amount generated wouldn’t add much to their budget.\nThe group described the issue as one of the state’s biggest inequities in school finance , but also the most challenging to tackle. That’s because there are a variety of reasons that communities don’t approve new taxes, and because in places where they do, there are also many reasons overrides don’t generate comparable amounts across different communities.\nLawmakers, with help from finance officials from school districts, created the state’s match program in 2022 . But district leaders have complained that the program has not helped much to close the disparities between what district’s can raise in additional local funds.\nIn 2022-23, the state gave $10 million to 27 districts through the program. More than half of the districts received less than $50,000 from the state. For the 2023-24 school year, lawmakers increased the matching funds to $21.1 million but then ended up distributing a second round of $15.7 million to additional districts after criticism of the program. The solution was a temporary one and so lawmakers created the working group to look more closely at the problem with the funding model.\nUnder the recommended new distribution model from the working group, which is made up of two lawmakers and seven school district finance leaders, districts classified as rural and small-rural by the state would have a different formula for eligibility and for calculating a match than urban or suburban districts.\nRural districts that are eligible based on existing voter-approved mill levy overrides, and the amount of assessed value in their community, would be topped off by the state to ensure that their override is producing a minimum of $200,000 per year.\nThe group proposed that the state would first dole out funding to those rural districts — currently, its estimate is that it would cost about $6 million in the first year.\nThen the state would distribute the rest of the money that the legislature can appropriate each year to the urban and suburban districts after. For this second tier, the state would calculate eligibility and match amounts using a similar model to the one it already uses, except for one change to the metrics that allows at least one more district, Adams 12, to be eligible for the match.\nUnlike for rural and small-rural districts, the proposed calculation for larger districts takes into account a community’s median income.\nFor the second group of districts, the state estimates the cost would be about $21.5 million, but could be adjusted down based on what’s left over after rural districts are prioritized.\nHaving a two-tiered approach “really represents a significant approach of maximizing what we can do with scarce amounts of dollars,” said one group member, Brett Johnson, the chief financial officer for the Aurora school district, who helped come up with the idea.\n“No matter what manipulation you’re making to the formula, from my perspective, it was rural and small rural that got the short end of the stick,” he added. “They got significantly lower amounts that sometimes didn’t make sense.”\nIn one previous year, one district got only about $2,000 in total from the state match program.\nOne group member said she expected having a minimum state match would help more districts use the program to ask voters to approve new mill levy overrides where they haven’t in the past.\nBut if that holds true, some group members raised concerns that the cost of the program could quickly rise. To be eligible for a match, a community must first have a mill levy override tax. If more districts are able to convince their voters who have never approved a mill levy override tax before, based on the incentive of the state match, more districts will be eligible for state dollars.\nThe working group also voted to recommend that the state report a breakdown of how much money is being distributed to school districts from the program so that lawmakers may adjust the program’s formula again in the coming years.\nThe working group will lay out its recommendations in a final report expected to be published in the next couple of weeks.\nYesenia Robles is a reporter for Chalkbeat Colorado covering K-12 school districts and multilingual education.

    "text": "COLUMBUS, Neb (KMTV) — Back in 2017 the city of Columbus asked its citizens what the community needed most. One of the top responses a place for kids to learn and grow and now years that dream is becoming a reality. “The museum itself is 100% STEAM based. That means we are focused on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Curriculum,” said Columbus Area Children’s Museum Executive Director Katie McNeil. The Columbus Area Children’s museum will offer something for every child up to 10 years of age, with rooms full of education and entertainment that will stimulate all of a child’s senses. “Touch, taste, sight, Hearing, experiencing. That’s more important now than it ever has been. Even in schools you see a lot of screens, we have some here but for the most part we want kids to be kids,” said McNeil. The exhibits aren’t just cool places to play, they are authentically Columbus. The Hospital facade behind me is based on Columbus Community Hospital, the Bank is based on First National Bank just down the street “These are things that are essential to our community. That is what Columbus is all about and this is just a great example of that,” said Columbus Mayor Jim Buckley. The Children’s Museum isn’t just designed to be fun but inclusive for every child who wants to experience it. The staff is 100% bilingual in English and Spanish and the Museum offers special spaces for children with sensory sensitivities. “We are, what we were told, the first Children’s Museum to be sensory certified. It means that 50% of staff have to be, but we have 100% of our staff trained in sensory sensitivities,” said McNeil. The museum is a non-profit and funded entirely through grants and donations. It’s been a lot of work to put together, but it couldn’t have happened without support from local businesses. “This couldn’t happen without businesses and people coming together with, not only their ideas and their work ethic, but also their pocketbooks to make this happen,” said Buckley. The Columbus Area Children's Museum will first open its doors to members on January 17th and will open its doors to the public on February 22nd. More information on on the museum and membership options can be found at columbuslearnandplay.org",
