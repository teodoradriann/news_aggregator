    "text": "Rate of stroke deaths among middle-age US adults hit two-decade high during COVID pandemic, report shows Middle-aged people in the United States are more likely to die from a stroke than they have been in about two decades, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Video above: Junk food is leading to memory problems and strokes After at least a decade of decline, the death rate from stroke for people ages 45 to 64 started to rise in 2012. By 2019, the stroke death rate for this age group had grown 7% from where it was seven years earlier, and it spiked another 12% in the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stroke deaths for this age group dipped slightly in 2022 but were still significantly higher than before the pandemic. More than 19,700 people ages 45 to 64 died from a stroke in 2022, according to the new report – about 24 deaths for every 100,000 people in this age group. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. overall, and most strokes happen to people 65 and older. Earlier [research](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2022/01/covid-19-increasing-stroke-risks-people-of-all-ages) has found that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of stroke for people of all ages. But the longer-term rise in stroke death rates among middle-aged people contrasts with the downward trend seen among seniors and elderly people over the past decade, says Sally Curtain, a statistician with the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and author of the new report. Also, racial and ethnic disparities in the death rate from stroke are much higher among middle-aged adults than they are for older adults, she said. Among those 65 and older, the stroke death rate for Black people was 24% higher than it was for White seniors; among those ages 45 to 64, it was 133% higher for Black people than White people. Middle-aged men are more likely to die from a stroke than middle-aged women, and stroke death rates are higher in the South than in any other region, according to the new report. In 2022, there were about 66 deaths from stroke for every 100,000 middle-aged Black men living in the South – nearly three times more than the overall rate for this age group. Experts warn that middle age is an important time to monitor your health and manage risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. \"Many people think about stroke being an older person's disease, and it is. The longer you're alive, the longer the risk factors have to cause plaque to form in blood vessels,\" said Dr. Elisabeth Breese Marsh, a vascular neurologist and director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview. But the arteries start to harden in middle age, which can exacerbate the build-up and lead to complications. \"All of these risk factors are so prevalent in society, and we're seeing them at earlier ages. It is not uncommon for younger people now to have strokes due to these comorbidities,\" said Marsh, who was not involved in the new report. \"No one wants to feel old, but it's taking care of yourself earlier on that really helps you to thrive in middle and later life.\" Stroke diagnosis and treatment options have evolved greatly over the past decade, experts say. And new ways to address comorbidities – such as blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that are used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity – hold promise in managing risk factors. But it's crucial for people who are having a stroke to act fast – and to have equitable access to health care and treatment, experts say. Strokes are often identified by a sudden severe headache, vision problems in one or both eyes, trouble walking, paralysis or numbness in the face or limbs, and trouble speaking or understanding others, according to the Mayo Clinic. The younger brains of middle-age adults have significant potential to recover if treated quickly and aggressively, Marsh said, but people in this age group may wait longer to seek care because they may be less likely to admit they need help. \"It's really important, whether it's the patient or their family, that they recognize the symptoms and get to the hospital as fast as possible,\" she said. \"Those first couple of hours are critical.\"",

    "text": "Rashee Rice stars in Chiefs' victory despite subzero temps KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Rookie wide receiver [Rashee Rice](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice) is from Dallas and played in college at [SMU](https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2567/smu-mustangs), so he has never played a game in weather remotely approaching that from Saturday night's [Chiefs](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs) wild-card playoff game at Arrowhead Stadium. Rice looked like a natural with the temperature at minus-4 degrees at kickoff, the fourth-coldest playoff game in NFL history. He had 130 receiving yards, sixth most by a rookie in the playoffs, and a touchdown on eight catches as the Chiefs advanced to next week's divisional round with a [26-7 win](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547750/dolphins-chiefs) over the [Miami Dolphins](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins). \"I feel like, to be honest, it was another game,\" Rice said. \"Everybody out here was playing for each other, so it was just like we just put the weather to the side and knew that our opponents didn't want to be out here in this cold as much as we didn't.\" The Chiefs, who led the league during the regular season in dropped passes and were among the leaders in turnovers, played a relatively clean game given the circumstances. They had a couple of drops but were able to overcome them each time. They didn't commit a turnover until running back [Clyde Edwards-Helaire](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242214/clyde-edwards-helaire) fumbled in the final minutes as the Chiefs were trying to kill the clock. [Patrick Mahomes](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes) was 23-of-41 for 262 yards and had an 11-yard scoring toss to Rice, who ran a shallow crossing route, caught the short pass and ran untouched to the end zone. \"The guys accepted the challenge,\" Mahomes said. \"We were able to throw the ball, we were able to run the ball. ... I thought the [offensive] line did a great job, and we had that mentality all week that we're going to go out there and play football. We know it's cold, but we're going to go out there and play football and see what happens.\" The Dolphins tried complicating those efforts by blitzing Mahomes at a rate he has rarely seen. He faced six or more pass-rushers 14 times, the most of his career. He saw five or more rushers on 51.2% of his dropbacks, which was tied for the highest rate of his career. But Mahomes wasn't sacked and didn't commit a turnover. \"I don't think they were anticipating us throwing the ball quite as much as we did, but we were able to come out and sling it,\" coach Andy Reid said. \"A lot of quarterbacks can't do that, what he did in that kind of weather.\" Rice was the Chiefs' leading wide receiver during the regular season by a wide margin. He improved as the season progressed and twice went for more than 100 yards in his final six games. \"Some of those guys hit that rookie wall, and it seems like he just kind of pushed right through it and he's just continued to get better and better and he's a great player,\" Mahomes said. \"He has that right mentality. He comes to work every single day, and he made a lot of great plays for us today that helped us win the football game.\" The rest of the Chiefs' wide receivers struggled much of the season. They were counting on significant production from [Kadarius Toney](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney), [Marquez Valdes-Scantling](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling) and [Skyy Moore](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore) but got it from none of them, so Rice's emergence was essential. Tight end [Travis Kelce](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce) caught seven passes against the Dolphins. No other receivers had more than two catches. \"It's hard to believe that he's a rookie,\" Reid said of Rice. \"The best part about him is he just keeps working. He's relentless with that, and he's got a good relationship [with Mahomes]. He's got Pat's respect, and he wants to do it the right way. \"He's getting better every week, and so I think we've seen that the last four games, five games.\"",

    "text": "Ather Energy organises Sadhya in the office, internet offended as it has chapatti Ather Energy has faced backlash after the company organised Onam Sadhya in the company. Why? Read to find out more! New Delhi: Onam Sadhya is a traditional vegetarian feast served during the Onam festival, a major celebration in the Indian state of Kerala. This elaborate meal, often enjoyed on a banana leaf, consists of a variety of dishes that showcase the rich culinary heritage of the region. Typically featuring more than 20 items, the Sadhya includes rice, along with an assortment of side dishes like sambar, avial, thoran, pickles, and papadum, as well as sweet treats like payasam. Each dish is meticulously prepared using seasonal ingredients, and the meal is a symbol of abundance, unity, and gratitude. Onam Sadhya is not just about food; it’s a celebration of community, tradition, and the harvest season. Asther Energy Onam Sadhya One company, Ather Energy, recently organised Onam Sadhya in office. Ather Energy CEO Tarun Mehta posted pictures on X, showing the Onam celebrations in the office. While everyone in the pictures look happy, Tarun and the company still came under the radar of criticism as one of the pictures showed a chapatti placed on the banana leaf as part of the Sadhya meal. Notably, roti is not a part of the Sadhya meal usually, which is why the criticism came the company’s way. Social media reacts Several social media users reacted to the pictures that Tarun Mehta posted. “There should be at least 28 dishes, also chapati shouldn’t be there,” one user wrote. “Chapati in an Onam sadhya. That’s a first!” another one wrote. Yet another person called it a North Indian Onam. “This is a random meal served on a leaf. Invoking the powers vested in me, I disqualify this as a Sadhya!” yet another comment read. “Onam with north indian style I guess. “Onam with north indian style i guess,” one more comment read. Well, it was a celebration nonetheless, don’t you think? What do you feel?",

    "text": "CALGARY, AB , Nov. 29, 2024 /CNW/ - Negotiations between Unifor and CPKC have reached an impasse after the company failed to engage meaningfully to make progress on the union's proposals on critical non-economic issues.\n\"CPKC's unwillingness to address the key concerns of our members is unacceptable,\" said Unifor National President Lana Payne . \"Our members deserve a contract that respects their contributions and ensures fair and equitable working conditions. Unifor remains fully committed to achieving that goal.\"\nLocal 101R will hold strike votes across the country in the coming weeks to show solidarity and determination in the fight for a fair agreement. The union sees this step as essential to ensuring members' voices are heard.\n\"It's clear to our union that these tactics by CPKC are designed with one goal in mind. They aim to create chaos so the government will bail them out rather than bargain a collective agreement with our union. We won't stand for that.\" said Payne.\nNegotiations with CPKC began last month, with the most recent round of discussions held November 26-29 . After limited progress, the union filed for conciliation in October, and despite further meetings, discussions have now reached a standstill. While the Union remains ready and willing to meet with the employer from now until the mediation and conciliation deadline of January 28 , CPKC has only offered to meet during the final four days, from January 24-28 . This limited window raises serious concerns about the employer's commitment to reaching a deal.\nUnifor represents approximately 1,200 members at CPKC who work as mechanics, labourers, diesel service attendants, heritage train mechanics and mechanical support workers, who are integral to the inspection, repair, and maintenance of CPKC's fleet of locomotives and railcars.\nUnifor is Canada's largest union in the private sector, representing 320,000 workers in every major area of the economy. The union advocates for all working people and their rights, fights for equality and social justice in Canada and abroad, and strives to create progressive change for a better future.\nSOURCE Unifor\nCopyright 2024 Canada NewsWire",

    "title": "St. Paul’s UCC in Pottstown celebrating 140 years",
    "text": "POTTSTOWN — One-hundred-and-forty years and 29 pastors after its founding, one of Pottstown’s oldest churches will be celebrating a special birthday on Sunday.\nSt. Paul’s United Church of Christ, now located at the corner of Grace and North Franklin streets, will celebrate the 140th anniversary of its founding. The worship service begins at 9 a.m. with the church’s Conference Minister, the Rev. Bill Worley, as the guest preacher. A brunch will follow the service.\nWhat follows is a church history provided by the current pastor, The Rev. Lauren Cain:\nThe church began in 1884 when the Rev. C.H. Herbst and a group of congregants from Zion’s Reformed Church began a new congregation, St Stephen’s Reformed Church, at the corner of Penn and Walnut Streets.\nThis photo from the year 1900 shows the Rev. Frank Laros, pastor at the time, conducting services at the old church at Walnut and Penn streets. (Photo courtesy of St. Paul’s UCC) This new congregation was at one time part of the St. Vincent Charge and later was renamed St Paul’s Reformed Church. In 1957, the congregation moved to its present location in Pottstown’s North End.\nThe old building at Penn and Walnut, large and difficult to maintain, was one cause of the congregation’s significant indebtedness. Two larger Reformed congregations, Zion’s and Trinity, were within a few blocks of St Paul’s.\nUnder the leadership of the Rev. Michael Schmidt, the congregation studied the matter and voted to relocate. Assistance was received from the Synod and National Missions, and Faith Church, Philadelphia. The ground on the current site was broken in February 1957 and the facility was occupied in December, under the leadership of the Rev. Dr. C.W. Ebbert.\nSt. Paul’s United Church of Christ was once located at the corner of Walnut and Penn streets. It is now a parking lot. (Image courtesy of St. Paul’s UCC Church) In 1984 (at the church’s centennial), the Rev. Bill Derstine, a son of the congregation, wrote this about the move: “One cannot overlook the unselfish quality of St Paul’s leadership when the vote was taken to relocate to the north end of town. Although there was much family sentiment to stay with the early vision and the ministry at Walnut and Penn, the congregation voted to relocate. There was a vision beyond individual and family needs, a desire to further the mission of the church of Jesus Christ. To date, that was one of the darkest, but also one of the finest hours of the congregation. It was a vote to give up its original identity and experience new life — not just new growth in terms of numbers.”\nChange had been occurring in denominational life as well. St. Paul’s was first “Reformed,” then part of the Evangelical and Reformed Church (with the E and R merger in 1934). In 1957, the United Church of Christ was formed by the merger of the Evangelical and Reformed Church and the Congregational Christian Church, and St. Paul’s became St Paul’s United Church of Christ (UCC), a proud member of the protestant denomination whose motto is “That They May All Be One” (this taken from Jesus’ prayer as recorded in John’s gospel, chapter 17).\nAfter moving to its present location in 1957, The Mercury carried a photo of the old St. Paul’s Church being torn down. (Photo courtesy of St. Paul’s UCC Church) Building projects continued after the initial move to the present location. In 1962, the Christian Education building and a new parsonage were built. In 1978, the congregation voted to renovate and expand the sanctuary; work was completed and the new sanctuary was dedicated in November 1980.\nDuring the 1990s, various alterations were made to the sanctuary. The original heating system was replaced in 2008, and the acquired a mobile stair climber so that the facility is more fully accessible. During the next two decades, St. Paul’s UCC would strengthen its commitment to supporting its community and neighbors by partnering with local organizations and other area churches to provide free meals, school supplies, diapers and overnight shelter during the winter months, among other things. As a church, St. Paul’s UCC looks ahead to the future with hope and promise, relying on God’s grace.\n“I am proud to be a part of Saint Paul’s because of its history of standing for social justice, not only in the past 140 years but also today,” said Rick Moser, Consistory President:\nSaid Cain: “I believe that St. Paul’s foundation as a church in, for, and with the community of Pottstown, coupled with the drive and dedication of its members and the abundant grace of God has allowed it to exist for so long.”",

    "text": "Phoenix drywall company owes $1.7 million for unpaid overtime\nA Phoenix-based company has been ordered to pay $1.7 million after the U.S. Labor Department took the owner to federal court over payroll practices.\nThe local district director says Bean Drywall Incorporated tried to cover up having shorted almost 250 workers.\nThe Labor Department says that between March of 2021 and March of this year, Bean Drywall did not pay workers overtime money they had earned.\nAfter an audit, Bean Drywall agreed to pay $875,000 in back wages, says company attorney Julie Pace. Then the government imposed damages.\n“And what the Department of Labor does is they have the company pay double the amount,” said Pace.\nBean Drywall must also pay a separate civil fine and interest.\nThe company that operates in metro Phoenix, Prescott and Sedona is more than 40 years old.\n“The company takes compliance with the law seriously. And they resolved the matter and settled it so they can move forward constructively,” Pace said.",

    "text": "There are concerns hundreds of homes in Warrnambool could be left uninsurable because of new flood modelling, the city council has been told.\nResident Steve Levett aired his concern at a council meeting on Monday, March 3, 2025 saying he had been told by a bank there were dozens of properties that would become uninsurable because of the new South Warrnambool and Dennington flood study.\nHe said the council agenda suggested property values impacted by flood modelling would typically drop by about five to 10 per cent but he'd been told it would be more.\n\"Specific enquiries with a bank confirm that properties that are now uninsurable and have a current collateral value of zero, which is not where I was situated 12 months ago,\" he said.\nMr Levett said it had directly affected his personal and business financial arrangements.\nThe council's city growth director Luke Coughlan said the aim of a recent flood study in South Warrnambool and Dennington was to provide updated planning tools to guide future development in a way that does not expose lives and property to undue risk in the future.\nAnd under the Planning and Environment Act, property valuations were not relevant considerations as part of a planning scheme amendment, he said.\nFears flood study could financially ruin people\nMr Levett also questioned how new flood modelling would impact properties east of Cassidy's Bridge.\n\"If you use the current level you are suggesting for South Warrnambool, and you shift it to the north side of Cassidy's Bridge, there's 1600 homes that are going to be underwater,\" he said.\n\"So council is going to be left with approximately 2000 to 2500 houses that have a net value of zero.\n\"Are you going to calculate my rates based on zero?\"\nAnother resident, who didn't want to be named, said it had the potential to financially ruin Warrnambool people.\nMr Coughlan said until there was funding to do a study, the council doesn't know what the levels would be east of Cassidy's Bridge.\n\"It is something that council needs to revisit,\" he said.\n\"There will likely be some impacts in that area as well. We don't know what the impact is going to be there but it does need to be looked at in the future.\"\nCarrying out a new study in the north Warrnambool area was something that had the backing of some councillors.\nWhy the big change in flood modelling?\nIan Bolden asked why there was such a difference between previous flood modelling and the new one.\nMr Coughlan said the key difference was that the 2007 study considered the 1946 flood as an outlier and disregarded it from their analysis.\n\"The 2007 model did not sufficiently allow for ocean effects,\" he said.\nMr Coughlan said the 2007 model had also oversimplified the Kelly Swamp, Salt Water Swap and Rutledges Cutting system.\n\"Three significant floods have occurred since 2007 and they have been incorporated into this model to make it more accurate,\" he said.\n\"There has been significant improvement as to modelling methods and guidance since 2007, and the revisions to the Climate Change considerations chapter of Australian Rainfall and Runoff have influenced this model.\"\nThe council was questioned about why the council wouldn't support another independent review of the flood study that affects hundreds of ratepayers.\nBut Mr Coughlan said the flood study - which had done by a qualified consultant in flood modelling - had already been independently reviewed by another consultant the council had separately appointed.\nIt has also been reviewed by Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority and council engineers.",

    "text": "[Internacional](/actualidad/internacional/) Una gran aurora boreal sorprende en mitad de un vuelo entre San Francisco y Lisboa: una de las imágenes más bonitas que vas a ver hoy Los pilotos no dudaron en grabarlo Madrid Volar por encima de las nubes, ver un amanecer desde el cielo, reconocer una ciudad en miniatura desde las alturas... Quien ha viajado en avión atesora bellas imágenes que no pueden contemplarse de otro modo. Los pilotos son los que guardan en sus retinas mayor número de recuerdos y saben detectar cuándo están ante una panorámica increíble. Eso les ocurrió hace algunos meses en un trayecto entre San Francisco y Lisboa y lo subieron, junto a otros muchos, a la cuenta @bestairplaneseat de YouTube, que en este caso además va señalando hasta los planetas que se divisan. Este vídeo que se ha hecho viral comienza con unas vistas impresionantes del cielo estrellado y los puntos de luz en la Tierra. Se contemplan con claridad diversas estrellas fugaces que se cruzan y se percibe perfectamente cómo se va rodeando la forma esférica de nuestro planeta. Sobre todo, cuando se empieza a detectar una luz especial que primero es amarilla pero pronto torna a verde: es una [aurora boreal](https://cadenaser.com/nacional/2023/02/28/el-regalo-inesperado-que-dos-pilotos-hacen-a-sus-pasajeros-en-pleno-vuelo-para-ensenarles-unas-espectaculares-auroras-boreales-cadena-ser/) que va haciéndose cada vez más grande hasta que cubre prácticamente todo el cielo. Una aurora boreal es un fenómeno luminiscente que se produce cuando las partículas solares cargadas eléctricamente —generadas por el viento solar— chocan con la magnetosfera de la Tierra. Se observa generalmente en zonas polares y es más fácil verlas de noche y en determinadas épocas del año. Los vuelos que unen San Francisco con Lisboa hacen una ruta que atraviesa Canadá, llega hasta Groenlandia y comienza a descender sobre el Atlántico. A mucha gente le sorprende que los aviones, especialmente en viajes de larga distancia, no sigan una ruta recta según vemos un mapa en 2D pero debemos tener en cuenta que la tierra es esférica achatada por los polos. En este caso son las llamadas líneas geodésicas las que establecen la distancia más corta entre dos puntos y, en el caso de la Tierra, son arcos de mayor o menor curvatura, dependiendo de la distancia que separa los dos puntos y de la diferencia de latitud entre ellos. Ese es el motivo por el que un vuelo que una San Francisco con Lisboa pasa por Groenlandia. No es habitual pero también pueden verse auroras boreales en latitudes más bajas. [El pasado mes de abril pudieron contemplarse en algunos puntos de España.](https://cadenaser.com/nacional/2023/04/27/no-es-un-hecho-imposible-la-explicacion-de-una-experta-sobre-las-auroras-boreales-vistas-en-espana-estos-dias-cadena-ser/) El astrofotógrafo Lorenzo Cordero explicaba que eso sucedió porque \"una poderosa llamarada del Sol golpeó la Tierra y causó una tormenta geomagnética “fuerte”, formando auroras boreales espectaculares muy al sur\".",

Just Eat ridurrà i turni di un'ora in automatico (a livello nazionale è a sua discrezione) nella fascia oraria dalle 12 alle 16, quando ci sono condizioni di rischio alto secondo le rilevazioni ufficiali del portale Worklimate.\n Per i turni si darà priorità ai rider che usano l'auto o in seconda battuta lo scooter o la bicicletta elettrica, mentre ci usa la bicicletta normale non lavorerà tutto il giorno. Le ore perse verranno recuperate la settimana successiva a meno che non ci sia la sospensione del servizio. In questo caso si potrà ricorrere alla cassa integrazione. L'azienda intensificherà le comunicazioni ai corrieri per ricordare loro che, nei giorni più critici, sarà possibile effettuare brevi interruzioni dal lavoro ad alta intensità fisica, senza necessità di preavviso e senza che questo comporti sanzioni o contestazioni disciplinari.\n Queste pause si aggiungono ai 5 minuti già previsti.\n L'accordo raggiunto - spiegano la Filt e la Cgil Torino e Piemonte - rappresenta un precedente rilevante a livello territoriale e conferma l'importanza di affermare tutele oggettive, immediate e non lasciate alla responsabilità individuale. La sicurezza sul lavoro deve essere una certezza, non una scelta individuale.\n Just Eat in Piemonte ha circa 500 rider concentrati quasi tutti nella città di Torino.",

Esta fruta contiene una gran variedad de nutrientes como Vitamina C, Provitamina A y Potasio. Además, de acuerdo con la Fundación Española del Corazón, se compone en un 85% de agua y aporta aproximadamente 35 calorías por cada 100 gramos, lo que la convierte en un alimento nutritivo y de pocas calorías.Es de conocimiento popular que la mandarina tiene varios beneficios para la salud, como su ayuda para aliviar resfriados y para fortalecer el sistema inmune,vdebido a su alto contenido en vitamina C. Sin embargo, esta fruta tiene muchas más propiedades curativas que te vamos a mostrar a continuación.Un artículo de la Fundación Española del Corazón y de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural destacan principalmente las siguientes:A su vez, la Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural menciona que comer mandarina nos protege de enfermedades cardíacas, combate el estreñimiento por sus niveles altos de fibra e impide la deshidratación del cuerpo.La mandarina no sólo se disfruta a gajos. En la cocina, la cáscara también se puede aprovechar para darle sabor a gelatinas, caramelos, panes y bebidas. De igual manera, se puede utilizar para elaborar aceites y sazonar carnes, ensaladas, pescados y mariscos.Finalmente, el blog de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural destaca que el aceite de mandarina se añade a productos cosméticos con el objetivo de proteger la piel, disminuir las manchas solares y prevenir la aparición de arrugas.* * * Mantente al día con las noticias, únete a nuestro canal de WhatsApp * * *EA",
