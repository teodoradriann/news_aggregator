[Nirmal Singh](https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/bigg-boss-12-contestant-nirmal-singh-5358985/), a former minister and the AAP’s national joint secretary, and Chitra Sarwara, a vice-president in the party’s Haryana unit, submitted their resignations to the [Rajya Sabha](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/) MP and AAP Haryana incharge Sushil Gupta Thursday citing “personal reasons.” The leader and daughter are likely to return to Congress in the first week of January. Both had joined the AAP in April 2022 after leaving the Congress. Confirming their next course of action, Nirmal Singh said that they would join the Congress in the presence of former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, state party chief Udai Bhan and the state’s party affairs in-charge Deepak Babaria in New [Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/) on January 5. A four-time MLA Nirmal Singh had turned a Congress rebel ahead of the 2019 Assembly polls. The father-daughter duo then contested fromAmbala City and Ambala Cantt constituencies as independent candidates. Later, they also formed the Haryana Democratic Front, a political outfit.",

    "text": "Seal recovering from shark attack — yes, NJ has both in its waters 🐳A harbor seal was likely bitten by a shark and found on an LBI beach 🐳Give a harbor seal space if you see them on a beach 🐳50 dolphins, 17 whales & 4 porpoises stranded on Jersey Shore beaches since Dec. 2022 SURF CITY — A harbor seal found with a large laceration on a Long Beach Island beach Christmas morning capped off a busy year for the Marine Mammal Stranding Center. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center said their technicians responded to the injured seal in Surf City and found multiple smaller wounds on his abdomen and around his tail. Veterinarians cleaned the wounds, which likely came from a shark bite. The seal, which weighs 57.4 pounds, is resting in the intensive care unit. Stress for stranded harbor seals Harbor seals are not uncommon on beaches in the early winter, according to the MMS. If you spot a seal in distress to stay 150 away from seals and to keep away as not to further stress them out. What is not common are sea turtles which may be beached because of \"cold stunning.\" Wind and tides may bring them to the shore, according [ to NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/cold-stunning-and-sea-turtles-frequently-asked-questions). The turtles become weak and inactive because of exposure to cold temperatures below 50 degrees. The MMSC asked anyone who spots a sea turtle on the beach should call their 24-hour hotline at 609-266-0538. Stranded whales & dolphins cause controversy It was a busy year for the MMS, which responded to the numerous reports of beached whales and dolphins along the Jersey Shore. Between December 2022 and December 2023 50 dolphins, 17 whales and four porpoises were found on New Jersey beaches setting up the debate over whether or not work on wind projects was the cause. Opponents of the projects repeatedly asked Gov. Phil Murphy to order a pause on the work to investigate whether or not there is a connection. Murphy refused calling the request politically motivated and said there is no evidence that limited wind farm construction on the Atlantic Coast has directly resulted in any whale deaths. Republican congressmen from New Jersey, Maryland and Arizona got the U.S. Government Accountability Office to open an investigation into the offshore wind industry's impacts on commercial fishing and marine life and want a moratorium on projects. Eight shore towns in Ocean and Atlantic counties have filed a lawsuit against the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection claiming the agency was under pressure from Murphy to approve wind project proposals.

    "title": "Did the Deep State install Pope Francis? Responding to Archbishop Viganò's claims - LifeSite",
    "text": "( LifeSiteNews ) — On this episode of Faith and Reason, John -Henry Westen and human trafficking victim advocate Liz Yore discuss Archbishop Viganò’s statement calling on Trump’s CIA to investigate a Deep State plot to replace Pope Benedict XVI with Pope Francis, how the alleged plot would invalidate the Francis pontificate, the need for answers before another conclave takes place, and more. The panel opened the episode by discussing Archbishop Vigano’s statement urging Trump’s CIA director to investigate the alleged plot to pressure Pope Benedict XVI into resigning and replace him with Pope Francis. Yore emphasized that she was one of the signatories of a similar letter to Trump at the beginning of his first term in 2017. Then she dove into why the American government may have wanted to replace Pope Benedict, namely because he opposed their globalist agenda on mass migration and climate change. “It was clear starting in the beginning of Pope Benedict’s papacy that number one, he was dramatically changing his position on migration into Europe. … This issue was bubbling up very early in his papacy, and it was clear not only the Regensburg speech ,” she said. “But also, that he began to understand and see the problem of what he would call the ‘climate change hoax.’ Recognizing that the globalists were using this ‘scientific idea’ as a justification for global depopulation.” Yore also stressed how Benedict had shut down negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) over the appointment of Chinese bishops because he found them to be untrustworthy. READ: Did Obama officials force Pope Benedict’s resignation? Open letter calls for Trump investigation “So you have climate change, which is the darling issue of the New World Order globalists. You have migration, which we’re now all suffering under, which is causing the collapse and destruction of Western civilization in Europe,” Yore said. “And also, that the Chinese who were trying to gain access into one would argue the most important institute in the world that has been an impenetrable obstacle to communism,” she added. Turning to the events leading up to Benedict’s resignation, Yore highlighted some of the red flags that show the Pontiff may have been coerced into resigning, including the banks shutting down in the Vatican and then re-opening after he announced his resignation. The big red flag for me was when they closed down the Vatican ATMs by order of the international Swift financial system. They closed down the Fed, and this was in the midst of Christmas when all the tourists are coming to the Vatican. And as a result, they only reopened the ATMs when Benedict resigned. And by the way, it was, I think 22 days after Joe Biden and Barack Obama began their second term that Benedict stood down and only … a few more weeks that the installation of Jorge Bergoglio into the See of Peter. Then Yore noted how leaked emails from political operatives like John Podesta show discussion about a “Catholic Spring.” “Emails which were also leaked, talking about the Catholic Spring and about putting together organizations that would force, you know, this ‘medieval’ administration of Ratzinger to become more modern and the need for a new, modern papacy,” she said. “All those things … really said to me that something was going on, this one, two punch, ‘we have to abdicate,’ as they always do in a coup, and then install their own person, which would have been, of course, Jorge Bergoglio,” she added. Later in the episode, the panel turned to Pope Francis’ recent health issues and rumors that there may soon be a conclave. “Right now, Pope Francis is at death’s door. We’ve been hearing about [how] he’s got a lung and a half, he went into the hospital, then they thought it got better, then they’re admitting it gets worse. They’re always trying to play it up for the best it could possibly be, that’s the way it goes,” the host said. “But reports are now that it’s really serious; we’re going to experience a conclave, very likely this year,” he added. Yore underscored that there cannot be a conclave until we know whether there was indeed a coup to replace Benedict with Francis. Otherwise, any conclave might be invalid. “Well, first and foremost, if this was a coup started by the New World Order (NWO) globalists, we’ve got to get to the bottom of it. And we cannot have an election of a new pope with all the cardinals, 75 percent or 80 percent of whom were appointed by an invalid Pope,” she said. “There cannot be a conclave until we find out, and when we find out, which I believe we will, there needs to be a reckoning.” For more discussion on the alleged coup against Pope Benedict XVI, the need to get to the bottom of it before the next conclave, and more, tune in to this episode of Faith and Reason .

    "text": "Northern Lights dazzle over Michigan; another viewing opportunity may be in store PETOSKEY — Those looking to the sky across much of North America got a glimpse of the Northern Lights on Thursday night, and they might get another chance on Friday. The aurora borealis seemed to be more prominent on Thursday than it had been earlier in the week. In Petoskey, handfuls of people gathered at Sunset Park and along the waterfront to watch the cosmic show.

The stellar display was amplified when a solar coronal mass ejection of plasma clouds and charged particles drove a geomagnetic storm toward Earth. The storm was so strong that it prompted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to issue a rare G4 geomagnetic storm watch for the second time this year. — Contact Jillian Fellows at jfellows@petoskeynews.com.",

    "title": "Why Britain is the place to invest in 2024: Experts tip 'screamingly cheap' UK stocks",
    "text": "Have you heard about the 3D reset? Do you know which stock market is ‘screamingly cheap’? Does a nation’s debt-to-GDP ratio loom large in your stock-picking strategy?\nIf you have resolved to take a cold hard look at your portfolio in the new year, these are themes tipped to determine the direction of markets in 2024.\nThere may be more heartening news about inflation and interest rates. But some analysts argue that economies have yet to feel the full impact of the higher borrowing costs imposed in 2023 – meaning that recession may be still be a threat in Britain and America.\nAgainst this background, it may be tempting to wait for the all-clear signal. But, as James Thomson of Rathbones points out, ‘that will never come, and often the best returns come when you least expect them.’\nIf you believe that fortune favours the brave, these are the themes that you cannot afford to ignore in 2024.\nBargain Britain: The FTSE All Share index has risen by just 1.7% over the past 12 months but many experts say UK stocks are currently undervalued\nThe 3D reset Alex Tedder and Tom Wilson, the global and emerging strategists at Schroders, say investors should be aware of what they call the ‘3D reset’ which will increasingly influence the mood of stock markets.\nThis is made up of three factors: demographic constraints; decarbonisation imperatives and deglobalisation initiatives.\nThese have created supply bottlenecks, driven up wage costs, boosted inflation and underpinned populism.\nIn the face of these challenges, investors would be well advised to change their mindset, focusing more on diversification in particular, rather than relying on US tech that dominates many portfolios.\nTedder and Wilson do not suggest that you bid farewell to the US in 2024, since ‘its corporate sector remains, in aggregate, better managed and more innovative than pretty much any other.’\nBut they do recommend that you explore unloved markets, such as Japan and the UK.\nDiversification is difficult, but Russ Mould of AJ Bell says that paying attention to certain themes can help you determine ‘which way the wind is blowing’ and to re-align your portfolio.\nDebt-to-GDP ratio In 2024, analysts will, as always, be carefully monitoring the prices of oil and of copper – ‘a reliable indicator of global economic health due to its many uses.’\nBut they will also be keeping a close eye on an ever-more important metric – a country’s debt-to-GDP.\nIf this ratio approaches 20 per cent, this should serve as an alert. China and France are already in this position, but America’s $1 trillion-a-year spending is bringing it into the danger zone.\nUS markets are pricing in five rate cuts in 2024. Mould argues that, if these cuts fail to materialise, this could imperil the $11.8 trillion combined market capitalisation of the Magnificent Seven.\nYield curve for Government bonds Mould also cites another key theme: the yield curve for government bonds which reflects the market sentiment about risk.\nThe yield curve is ‘inverted’, that is the yields on ten-year UK gilt-edged stocks and US bonds are lower than those on two-year bonds.\nThe reverse should be the case with longer-term bonds offering a higher yield, as compensation for the possibility that catastrophe could arise at some point in their longer lifespan.\nNever bet against America?\nInvesting legend: Warren Buffett\nAmerican markets have flourished in 2023, ending the year in style with the three major indices – the Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq – rising for seven straight weeks.\nBoosting share prices has been the hope that interest rates will move downward in 2024.\nThere are also hopes that the Magnificent Seven tech stocks will continue to flourish, as the artificial intelligence boom continues to gather strength.\nBut the analysts at UBS are also tipping Boeing, Coca-Cola, Domino’s Pizza, Merck, Visa and Ulta Beauty, amid the belief that the search for beauty is a theme in any year.\nAnother enduring theme is never betting against America – which has sustained billionaire Warren Buffett, pictured, for more than six decades.\nWage settlements Mould suggests that you watch wage settlements, given their impact on inflation.\nThe Bank of England is predicted to cut interest rates early in the new year, following the surprise drop in the inflation rate to 3.9 per cent. But the Bank seems unwilling to make a move until pay rises moderate.\nThese issues mean that you will hear many analysts talk about ‘a scarcity of certainty’.\nBut this is likely to raise the profile of what Thomson calls ‘recession-resistant stocks that can survive in any economic cycle.’\nHe includes in this category such diverse companies as discount retailer Costco, with its loyal and growing client base and Hermes, maker of exclusive handbags. Diversification involves embracing the high and the low.\nBargain Britain Experts are declaring that the UK is the place to invest in 2024. This claim will be greeted with some cynicism by those who backed Britain in 2023 and were sorely disappointed.\nThe FTSE All Share index has risen by just 1.7 per cent over the past 12 months which looks distinctly unimpressive compared with the 24.6 per cent increase in the irrepressible S&P 500.\nBut the conviction remains that the UK is ‘screamingly cheap’, according to Matthew Bennison, of Schroder Income Growth fund.\nHe is boosting his British holdings, taking the view that they will fare well over a three-year horizon.\nSimon Gergel, manager of the Merchants investment trust, also contends that Britain is a bargain, saying that investors pay £10 for every pound of profit in the UK compared with $20 for every dollar of profit in the US.\nThe belief that British business is on offer at a discount lies behind the continuing wave of foreign takeovers of UK companies.\nLast month the mighty Mars corporation gobbled up Hotel Chocolat, maker of the Sleekster and other indulgences, in a £524million deal.\nNews of the takeover sent Hotel Chocolat shares soaring by 160 per cent.\nThis underlines the gap between our perception of our home-grown firms and the view in some quarters of Wall Street that they are the equivalent of a Sleekster chocolate box at the price of a Milk Tray selection.\nHowever Pimco, the biggest US name in corporate bond, is betting that the UK is headed for a hard landing triggered by a delayed consumer reaction to higher interest rates.\nAnd angst over the outcome of Brexit lies behind the undervaluation of UK shares. Some will still conclude the UK is cheap for a reason.\nBut this could prove short-sighted when analysts at the US broker Jefferies are tipping Prudential and Standard Chartered as the shares to watch in 2024, forecasting that they could grow by 105 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.\nMould is tipping GSK, the pharma giant (for the cautious) Legal & General (a balanced pick), Ashmore, the equipment supplier (a more adventurous selection) and insurance broker Lancashire (for income).",

    "text": "Mayotte L'archipel en alerte rouge cyclonique ce soir, des vents de 180 km/h attendus\nEn raison du passage du cyclone Chido, l'archipel est en alerte rouge ce vendredi soir à partir de 22h (20h à Paris). Le préfet appelle les habitants mal-logés à se rendre dans les centres d'hébergement du département.\nL'archipel de Mayotte sera placé en alerte rouge cyclonique ce vendredi à 22h (20h à Paris) en raison du passage du cyclone Chido, a annoncé le préfet de ce département français dans l'océan Indien. « C'est un événement inédit, d'une extrême violence, les vents pourront dépasser 180 km/h », a expliqué François-Xavier Bieuville lors d'une conférence de presse.\nLe préfet a appelé les personnes logées dans des habitations précaires, très nombreuses dans le département le plus pauvre de France, à se confiner dans l'un des 71 centres d'hébergement ouverts par les autorités. Ces centres, situés dans les établissements scolaires et gymnases, « seront ouverts à tous », a-t-il assuré.\nRafales, pluies intenses et vagues submersives\nLe cyclone Chido, qui se situe actuellement à environ 500 km au nord-est de Mayotte, est un « cyclone tropical intense » explique Météo-France, qui prévoit « de violentes rafales de vents, des pluies intenses, des vagues submersives couplées à une surélévation de la mer ». Ces conditions météorologiques fortement dégradées entraînent « un risque de ruissellement et d'inondation, et une houle marine qui peut avoir des effets importants sur le littoral » a ajouté François-Xavier Bieuville, qui a enjoint les bateaux à « impérativement rejoindre la terre ferme ».\nAéroport et écoles fermés\nToute circulation sur la voie publique sera interdite à partir de 22 heures et l'aéroport de Dzaoudzi sera fermé à partir de 20 heures (18h heure de Paris), a précisé le préfet. La dernière barge, qui relie Dzaoudzi à Mamoudzou, partira à 17 h 30. Le ministère de l'Intérieur avait annoncé jeudi l'envoi à Mayotte de 110 professionnels de la sécurité civile depuis l'île de La Réunion. Tous les établissements scolaires de l'archipel sont fermés vendredi et samedi.\nL'archipel de Mayotte, relativement épargné par les cyclones, avait déjà été touché par le cyclone Belna en 2019, qui n'avait cependant pas fait de dégât majeur.",
