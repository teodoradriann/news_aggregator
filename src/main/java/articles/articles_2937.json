    "text": "Nintendo confirmed back in November 2024, two months before the company even unveiled the Nintendo Switch 2, that the new console would be backward-compatible with games for the original Nintendo Switch. Now, after detailing the system’s hardware and software in an hourlong Nintendo Direct presentation, the company has provided the first real specifics on the nature of Switch 2’s backward compatibility.\nEverything we know about Nintendo Switch 2 backward compatibility\nMore than 180 Switch games may not play properly\nIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nSamit Sarkar(he/him) is Polygon’s deputy managing editor. He has more than 17 years of experience covering video games, movies, television, and technology.\nWe now know that the Switch 2 will work with many Switch accessories — including, most importantly, the original console’s Joy-Cons and Pro Controller — as well as games. But as Nintendo has previously hinted, not every Switch game will be playable (or, at least, fully playable) on the Switch 2. Here’s what we’ve learned so far.\nWill the Switch 2 be backward-compatible with physical and digital Switch games?\nYes, Nintendo confirmed in its April 2 Nintendo Direct that the Switch 2 will support both physical and digital copies of Switch games. The size of the cartridge isn’t changing; it’s just that Game Cards for the Switch 2 will be red, as opposed to the gray ones for the original Switch. (They’ll also have “much faster data reading speeds” than the old ones, said Tetsuya Sasaki, hardware design lead for the Switch 2, in the Nintendo Direct.)\nHow will Switch 2 backward compatibility work?\nThe Switch 2 doesn’t contain any hardware from the original Switch, and Nintendo isn’t relying on software emulation for backward compatibility, either. Instead, the company’s solution falls “somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility,” said Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta in an Ask the Developer interview published by Nintendo. Sasaki explained, “The process of converting game data for Switch to run on Switch 2 is performed on a real-time basis as the data is read in,” which makes it sound similar to the way Proton gets Windows PC games to run on the Linux-based Steam Deck.\nThis method allows for adding Switch 2 features, such as GameChat support, to Switch games played via backward compatibility. Dohta added, “We believe there are many things we can do, such as making Switch games compatible with GameShare through free updates, as well as leveraging Switch 2’s processing power to enable games to run in higher resolution and with a smoother frame rate.”\nSo the Switch 2 will run Switch games better?\nNintendo has not indicated that the Switch 2 will provide across-the-board improvements to graphics or performance when running Switch games, although that will happen with some games. It appears that it will be up to developers and publishers to issue patches to deliver these upgrades.\nSo far, Nintendo has detailed two different strategies for upgrading first-party Switch games. Select titles — the list on the Nintendo website currently features a dozen — will get “free updates to improve playability on the Nintendo Switch 2 system.” The games in question run the gamut from launch-year titles like Super Mario Odyssey to recent releases such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. In addition to performance improvements, these patches can add elements like support for Switch 2 features such as GameShare.\nThe other upgrade route sounds like it will offer more significant additions and improvements to certain Switch games — but this one will cost you money. Nintendo will sell what it calls an “upgrade pack” for these titles; the company hasn’t yet said how much it will charge. A bundle of a game and its upgrade pack will be known as a “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.”\nAt this point, the company has announced upgrade packs for six games: Kirby and the Forgotten Land, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and the upcoming titles Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokémon Legends: Z-A (both of which are scheduled to launch in 2025).\nThe details vary greatly depending on the game. For the new Pokémon game, all you get is “improved performance with higher frame rate and resolution.” Both of the Zelda upgrades will deliver that, along with faster load times, HDR, and support for the new Zelda Notes service. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be playable on Switch 2 with mouse controls, thanks to the Joy-Con 2. And the upgrade packs for both Super Mario Party Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land will offer new content.\nWill the Switch 2 be backward-compatible with all Switch games?\nThat would be a tall order, and the answer is no — but the level of support, as seen on a page on the Nintendo website that details the Switch 2’s backward-compatibility functionality, does seem impressive so far.\nNintendo is currently working its way through the entire library of Switch games one by one, conducting “limited testing” with each game to see if it works on the Switch 2. “It might not be that all Switch games run perfectly in time for the launch of Switch 2, but we will continue our efforts so that we can support as many Switch games as possible,” said Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto in the Ask the Developer interview.\nSwitch 2 backward compatibility support for first-party games\nNintendo says that as of April 1, it has tested 122 first-party Switch titles and found only one that doesn’t work with the Switch 2 — Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. That package came with a cardboard contraption that turned the Switch into a pair of virtual reality goggles, and the Switch 2 is a bigger device, so it simply can’t fit into it.\nHowever, Nintendo Labo won’t be completely dead on the Switch 2: Toy-Con 01, Toy-Con 02, and Toy-Con 03 will each work to some degree. Those three titles and six others can only be played on the Switch 2 using Joy-Cons from the original Switch, because they rely on something unique about those controllers. Some games, like WarioWare: Move It!, need the infrared camera in the right Joy-Con, which doesn’t exist in the Joy-Con 2; others, like Ring Fit Adventure, use an accessory that the Joy-Con 2 can’t fit into.\nSwitch 2 backward compatibility support for third-party games\nBy Nintendo’s count, more than 15,000 third-party games have been released for the Switch. In the company’s testing so far, it has found 141 titles that don’t boot up at all on the Switch 2, including popular games such as Dead by Daylight, Doom Eternal, and Fortnite. (Thankfully, Fortnite appeared in the April 2 Nintendo Direct as a Switch 2 launch title, which takes care of that concern.) An additional [47 games are listed as “playable” with “some in-game compatibility issues”](https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf?_gl=1*1mvf4ij*_gcl_au*MjEwNDA4NjcyNC4xNzQzNjAzMjk1*_ga*OTk0OTIyMzA4LjE3NDM2MDQwMDk.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzYxNjY4My40LjEuMTc0MzYyMDE3OS4wLjAuMA..); these include Alan Wake Remastered, Fall Guys, and Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.\nIt’s possible that those numbers will go up as Nintendo tests more games, but it’s also likely that some titles will come off these lists as the company works with third parties to address the compatibility issues.\nWill the Switch 2 work with Switch accessories like controllers?\nYup! With a few exceptions, peripherals such as the Switch’s Joy-Cons and Pro Controller will be compatible with the Switch 2. You can check [Nintendo’s support site](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68426/kw/switch%202/p/989) for a full list of Switch accessories to see whether the Switch 2 supports them.\nAs far as the Joy-Cons go, note that because the Switch 2 uses a magnetic hookup for its Joy-Con 2 controllers — rather than the sliding mechanism for the original Switch and its Joy-Cons — it isn’t possible to connect Switch Joy-Cons to the Switch 2; they can only be paired and used wirelessly. (That also means that you won’t be able to charge the Joy-Cons unless you slide them back onto your Switch, or you have a Charging Grip or Charging Stand for that system lying around.)\nThe Switch Pro Controller can be charged by plugging it into the Switch 2 dock or one of the system’s two USB-C ports, but it must still be paired wirelessly in order to be used. In other words, a [wired connection](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49387/~/how-to-use-the-nintendo-switch-pro-controller-as-a-wired-controller) isn’t supported with the Switch 2 as it is with the Switch.\nCan the Switch 2 be used with the original Switch’s dock?\nNo, unfortunately. While Nintendo made a point of saying in its April 2 Nintendo Direct presentation that the Switch and Switch 2 have the exact same depth — they’re both 13.9 mm (0.55 in) thick — the original Switch’s dock is not compatible with the Switch 2. The issue could come down to physical differences in the bottom edge of the console that prevent it from sitting in the old dock.\nCan microSD cards be used to expand the Switch 2’s storage?\nThe Switch 2 features 256 GB of onboard storage, and it can be expanded [only with microSD Express cards](/news/549531/switch-2-microsd-express-card-specs-price-where-to-buy). This is a flash memory standard with significantly faster read and write speeds than the standard microSD cards that the original Switch supports.\nYou can slot a microSD card from your original Switch into the Switch 2, but the only thing you’ll be able to do with it is view screenshots or videos captured in Switch games to the card.",

    "text": "Kubernetes and PostgreSQL represent pivotal technologies in the modern data storage and platform landscape. Their integration has become increasingly important for businesses looking to efficiently manage large datasets and applications. This article explores the significance of these technologies and their roles in contemporary data management.\nKubernetes: A Game Changer in Application Management\nKubernetes, an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers, has revolutionized the way businesses handle their applications. Its ability to manage containerized applications across multiple hosts offers unparalleled flexibility and efficiency. This is particularly beneficial for organizations dealing with high-traffic applications and complex workloads.\nPostgreSQL: The Backbone of Reliable Data Storage\nPostgreSQL, on the other hand, is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. Known for its robustness, extensibility, and technical standards compliance, PostgreSQL has been a preferred choice for many organizations requiring reliable data storage solutions. Its compatibility with various programming languages and suitability for handling a range of data types makes it versatile for different business needs.\nSynergizing Technologies for Enhanced Data Management\nThe synergy of Kubernetes and PostgreSQL allows for the creation of a highly efficient, scalable, and reliable data platform. Kubernetes facilitates the orchestration of PostgreSQL instances, ensuring that they are efficiently deployed, managed, and scaled according to the needs of the application. This integration is not just about managing data more efficiently; it's about creating a dynamic environment where data interaction is seamless and secure.\nSecuring Data Against Emerging Threats\nAccording to realtimecampaign.com, the integration of these technologies is not without its challenges. One such challenge is ensuring the security of PostgreSQL databases within Kubernetes environments. As databases are increasingly targeted by cyber threats like cryptojacking, it’s crucial to adopt strategies for Securing PostgreSQL from Cryptojacking Campaigns in Kubernetes . This involves implementing robust security measures to protect data from unauthorized access and malicious activities.\nAddressing Data Security in Kubernetes and PostgreSQL Environments\nThe challenge of ensuring data security in environments utilizing Kubernetes and PostgreSQL is a critical concern. While the integration of these technologies drives efficiency and scalability, it also necessitates robust security measures. This is where solutions like Portworx come into the picture to address specific security needs in such environments. These solutions play a significant role in reinforcing data protection, especially when dealing with sensitive and critical business data.\nThe focus here is on the broader concept of enhancing data security within Kubernetes and PostgreSQL ecosystems. It’s essential to understand that while tools offer functionalities that can aid in securing data, the core objective is to maintain the integrity and security of the data platform as a whole. Organizations must assess their specific requirements and choose appropriate solutions that align with their security strategy and infrastructure needs.\nFinding the Right Solutions for a Complex Data Landscape\nOrganizations looking to leverage Kubernetes and PostgreSQL can find valuable resources and tools to simplify deployment, management, and scaling of their applications. The integration of these technologies leads to a more resilient, agile, and efficient data platform, capable of handling the complexities of modern data requirements.\nThe convergence of Kubernetes and PostgreSQL marks a significant development in data platform and storage technologies.

En 2018 recibió el Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Investigación Científica y Técnica y en 2022, el Premio Nobel. Ahora está de vuelta en Oviedo porque hoy será investido Honoris Causa por la Universidad.\n–¿Qué supone para usted que la Universidad de Oviedo le reconozca de este modo?\n–Es un placer y un gran honor. Yo ya había estado en el Principado en 2018, para recoger el Premio Príncipe de Asturias y esto es como volver a casa.\n–¿Por qué empezó usted a trabajar sobre los neandertales?\n–Fue cuando empecé a investigar el ADN ancestral y fue casi sin querer que acabé teniendo un trabajo en Alemania y los neandertales son probablemente los alemanes más famosos (risas). Es obviamente algo muy interesante porque es el pariente más cercano de todos los que estamos vivos a día de hoy. Evolutivamente, es increíble ver cómo los neandertales se parecen a la gente de hoy en día.\n–Los neandertales viven dentro de nosotros –los humanos modernos tenemos una media del 2% de ADN suyo–, ¿de qué manera nos influyen sus genes?\n–De diferentes maneras: hay contribuciones que son beneficiosas, como por ejemplo ser menos propensa a sufrir un aborto si estás embarazada o que reacciones mejor a cierta mediación. Y luego también hay cosas que no son tan buenas, como que puedes tener mayor riesgo de ponerte muy enfermo si te infectas del virus SARS-COV-2.\n–Usted conoce muy bien la cueva de El Sidrón, ¿qué aprendió de ella?\n–Los especímenes de El Sidrón contribuyeron a la primera versión de los neandertales. Además, es un sitio muy interesante porque es uno de esos pocos lugares donde hay lo que parece ser un grupo, un grupo contemporáneo de neandertales.\n–Hay otra especie, los denisovanos, que conocemos por un pequeño trozo de hueso de dedo que se encontró. ¿Qué se sabe de ellos?\n–Lo raro de ellos es que fueron descubiertos por la secuencia del genoma que determinó ese pequeño trozo de hueso. Sabemos por su genoma que ellos influyeron en personas que hoy en día viven en Asia continental y también en personas de Oceanía. En Papúa Nueva Guinea, por ejemplo, el 5 o 6% del genoma viene de ellos.\n–¿Cree que pronto se descubrirán más datos de esa especie?\n–Por supuesto. Creo que se encontrarán huesos y cráneos de denisovanos y, de hecho, creo que muchos de ellos ya existen en museos, solo que no sabemos que son de denisovanos. Y luego creo que, cuando tengamos más bancos de biología en Asia, podremos asociar las variantes de los denisovanos con aspectos de la gente actual, igual que pudimos hacerlo en Europa con los neandertales, gracias a los biobancos.\n–¿En qué está trabajando ahora?\n–Estamos trabajando en dos aspectos: en las variantes de los neandertales y los denisovanos en la gente de hoy en día y en usar el genoma neandertal para encontrar cambios en humanos modernos que hoy todos compartimos, pero que los neandertales no tenían. Es como una especie de receta genética de lo que es ser un humano moderno para entender las consecuencias de algunos cambios.\n–Si usted pudiera viajar en el tiempo, ¿qué le gustaría ver en directo?\n–Sería extremadamente interesante conocer a algún neandertal y hablar con ellos para averiguar cómo se comunicaban.\nLos estudiantes e investigadores de la Facultad de Biología de Oviedo se rindieron ayer ante los conocimientos de Svante Pääbo. Tuvieron la suerte de poder participar en un encuentro con el ganador de un Nobel y un Princesa de Asturias y no desaprovecharon la oportunidad. Lo escucharon atentamente durante su intervención y también le lanzaron unas cuantas preguntas «en un perfecto inglés», tal y como aplaudían algunos de los presentes. Se formó un ambiente muy entrañable, que el homenajeado calificó de «fantástico». Disfrutó viendo el talento y el interés de estos jóvenes, que son el futuro más cercano de las ciencias. Esta actividad sirvió como preámbulo al acto hoy de investidura de Pääbo como nuevo Honoris Causa de la Universidad.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\n<a href=\"https://www.elnortedecastilla.es/valladolid/juzgado-libra-deuda-millones-empresario-hijos-20240416000225-nt.html#vca=voc-recirc&vso=elcomercio\">\nEl juzgado perdona una deuda de 2,6 millones a un empresario con 10 hijos\n</a>\nEl Norte de Castilla\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nComentar es una ventaja exclusiva para suscriptores\n¿Ya eres suscriptor?\nNecesitas ser suscriptor para poder votar.\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

This is part of the new initiative to feature student ambassadors from the school where the board meeting is being held.\nThe celebratory student recognitions began with Ms. Agrusa congratulating Elmont Memorial High School senior Aafia Ahmed for being selected to present her poster at the 2024 American Society for Cell Biology national conference in San Diego, California. She has worked with researchers at Albert Einstein for the last two years to understand cellular mechanisms behind methylmercury protection.\nThe successful fall season of H. Frank Carey High School’s varsity cheerleaders was highlighted. The team received first place in the Nassau County Class B Game Day Cheerleading Championship and second place in the New York State Class B Game Day Cheerleading Championship. Additionally, Coach Melanie Velez was named Nassau County Class B Coach of the Year.\nThe Marching Knights of Sewanhaka, the district’s competitive marching band under the direction of Matthew Povolny, were applauded for their remarkable 2024 season. The marching band received third place in the Large School 3 Division of the New York State Field Band Championship, earning a score of 82.65.\nThe commendations continued with the recognition of Floral Park Memorial High School’s varsity boys soccer team for their outstanding fall season. The Knights are Nassau County Champions, Long Island Champions and Class A New York State Champions. This is the first time the Knights have earned the Long Island and State Championship titles.
