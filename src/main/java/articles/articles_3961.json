    "title": "Derek Carr shines as Saints blast Falcons",
    "text": "Derek Carr threw a season-high four touchdown passes and the host New Orleans Saints defeated the Atlanta Falcons 48-17 to keep their Wild Card hopes alive on Sunday afternoon.\nCarr passed for 264 yards while Kendre Miller had his biggest workload of the season in the absence of injured Alvin Kamara and rushed for 73 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.\nThe Saints (9-8) tied Tampa Bay for first place in the NFC South, but the Buccaneers won the division in a tie-breaker.\nDesmond Ridder, starting in place of injured Taylor Heinicke (ankle), passed for 291 yards with two touchdowns and an interception for the Falcons (7-10). Bijan Robinson rushed for just 28 yards, but he caught seven passes that went for 103 yards and a touchdown.\nThe first possession of the second half ended when Alontae Taylor intercepted Ridder, giving the Saints a first down at the Falcons’ 25. Two plays later, Carr threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave to give New Orleans a 24-17 lead.\nThe Saints pushed the lead to 31-17 when Carr threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Rashid Shaheed.\nAtlanta had a chance to make it a one-score game, but on fourth and goal from the 2, Ridder threw an incompletion, leaving the Saints with a 14-point lead entering the fourth quarter.\nBlake Grupe kicked a 24-yard field goal after a 92-yard drive, then Carr threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to A.T. Perry and Jamaal Williams rushed 1 yard for a touchdown to close the scoring outburst in the fourth.\nOn the Falcons’ first possession of the game, Ridder’s 56-yard completion to Scotty Miller set up his 15-yard touchdown pass to Jonnu Smith for a 7-0 lead.\nThe Saints answered on the ensuing possession when Carr threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Perry.\nTwo plays later, Ridder threw a short pass to Robinson, who broke free for a 71-yard touchdown reception and a 14-7 lead at the end of the first quarter.\nMiller’s 3-yard touchdown run tied the score before Grupe kicked a 24-yard field goal and Younghoe Koo kicked a 30-yard field goal at the gun to produce a 17-all tie at halftime.\n–Field Level Media",

    "title": "I Cannot Overstate How Terrible These Disney World Lines Are (So Here’s How to Avoid Them)",
    "text": "If there’s one thing that you’re DEFINITELY going to experience in Disney World , it’s lines!\nRemy’s Ratatouille Adventure always has long lines Those queues come in all shapes and sizes. You’ve got the attractions that you basically walk right onto, and you’ve got the rides that you might spend half of your day in. And you’ve got some truly “special” lines that are just plain terrible (and we can’t overstate it)! So let’s talk about those queue lines and how you can avoid them!\nAs we were saying, it’s amazing just how terrible some Disney World lines are, so let’s talk about those lines and the best ways to avoid them!\nSpace Mountain Space Mountain is a classic, right, but its line? Not so much.\nThe Space Mountain line is LONG To be fair, it’s one of the fewer queues that has A/C (which is so nice in the Florida heat), but since the queue is indoors, it means that when people get loud (and believe me, they will), the sound bounces off the walls and hits you from every angle. Also, the queue itself is incredibly long, which means that when the sound turns up, it’s like being trapped in a loud, never-ending tunnel.\nSpace Mountain line So, if this ride is a must-do for you (I mean, it’s basically a rite of passage), you’ll want to consider grabbing a Lightning Lane reservation or heading there first thing in the morning (rope dropping) as that can save you from the noise assault and shave off a good chunk of the waiting time.\nSoarin’ Around the World Soarin’ is one of those must-do rides that’s on everyone’s list, but let me tell you, the line is quite a “snoozefest.”\nSoarin’ It’s such a long queue from start to finish. It used to have some fun interactive games that helped everyone pass the time, but those are long gone. Now, it’s just you and your thoughts for what feels like forever.\nSoarin’ Queue The best way to avoid this potentially mind-numbing wait is to snag a Lightning Lane or head there late in the day when the crowds are thinner. Trust me, you do not want to spend an hour+ of your Disney World day staring at nothing but walls.\nAlien Swirling Saucers and Slinky Dog Dash The queues for these two rides in Toy Story Land can be quite “torturous” especially if you catch them on a hot day (which is basically everyday at Disney World).\nAlien Swirling Saucers Line There’s minimal shade, and when you’re stuck in the lines (which are almost always extremely long) for what feels like an eternity, you end up melting into the pavement.\nSlinky Dog Dash line. So, if you don’t want to become a human puddle, try to hit these rides early in the morning or during the evening when the sun isn’t as brutal. Lightning Lanes are also your best friend here, so don’t hesitate to use them.\nKilimanjaro Safaris Okay, so Kilimanjaro Safaris is amazing, there’s no denying it, but that line can stretch on for what feels like miles, especially during its peak times. And if it’s a hot day, forget about it. You’ll find yourself sweltering long before you even see the first animal.\nKilimanjaro Safaris Line What you’ll want to do to avoid the worst of it is to aim for a morning safari when the sun hasn’t turned the queue into an oven. Now, if you can’t make it early, go for the opposite end of the day or, of course, grab a Lightning Lane.\nMagic Carpets of Aladdin You know how Magic Carpets of Aladdin looks like it’s a quick and easy ride? Well, the ride alone is just that, but the queue is quite the sun trap. There’s almost no shade, which means you’ll be baking while you wait.\nMagic Carpets of Aladdin Honestly, unless this ride is a must-do for you, you’re probably better off skipping it especially if the line looks long. However, if you’re determined to ride it, you can try hitting it up during the fireworks when the crowds are significantly thinner, and the sun has finally set.\nHow to Avoid the Worst Lines Overall, the key to avoiding the worst of these lines is in your timing and planning. Lightning Lanes are going to be your go-to for skipping long waits, but if you’re not into paying extra, rope dropping or going late in the day can save you a ton of time and discomfort.\nSpace Mountain Now, specifically with Magic Kingdom rides, the fireworks are your best friend. While everyone’s watching the show, you can sneak in shorter lines and enjoy the cooler temps.\nMagic Kingdom fireworks Those are just a couple of our thoughts on the worst queue lines at Disney World, and now we want to hear from you!

Na ação, um homem terminou preso em flagrante e quatro lojas foram lacradas pelos fiscais.\nSegundo a Polícia Civil, a operação, chamada de \"Desmonte\", tinha como objetivo coibir a venda de peças receptadas de veículos furtados ou roubados na metrópole. Os agentes vistoriaram autopeças nos bairros Jardim Amazonas e Campo Belo.\n\"As diligências dessa natureza têm como objetivo conferir a regularidade documental dos estabelecimentos, bem como identificar eventuais peças de origem ilícita ou espúria\", informou a corporação.\nNa operação, quatro lojas foram lacradas pela Prefeitura de Campinas e pelo Detran por irregularidades na documentação e uma moto foi apreendida por suspeita de irregularidade na placa.\nEm um desses estabelecimentos, o proprietário foi preso em flagrante por falta de etiqueta do Detran nas peças de veículos oriundos leilão. Ele pagou fiança e vai responder ao processo em liberdade.\nAção de fiscalização\nSegundo o delegado José Carlos Fernandes, chefe da Divisão Especializada de Investigações Criminais (Deic), operações rotineiras têm sido feitas com o intuito de garantir que as autopeças de usados atuem \"dentro da legalidade\".\n\"Essas lojas têm por obrigação ter em todas as peças o selo de autorização do Detran e também a autorização de funcionamento da Prefeitura\", explicou.\nFernandes reforçou a importância da população não adquirir peças de veículos que não sejam legalizadas, itens geralmente com preços muito abaixo do valor de mercado. \"Além de estar contribuindo para a prática de crimes (roubo, furto e latrocínio), essas pessoas também podem responder pelo crime de receptação\", afirmou o delegado.\nVÍDEOS: tudo sobre região de Campinas\n50 vídeos Veja mais notícias da região no g1 Campinas\nCampinas",

En un principio, toda la humanidad fue elegida para esta tarea. Sin embargo, los primeros hombres no dieron cumplimiento a esta, misión y permitieron que la- corrupción y la violencia predominaran sobre la justicia y la bondad. Por ese motivo, Dios determinó que se produjera el Gran Diluvio (Mabul) a fin de eliminar a los malvados. En lo sucesivo el castigo por incumplimiento se llevaría a cabo a nivel nacional y no universal. Por esa razón Dios eligió a una nación en particular para que cumpliera esta misión. El Pueblo Elegido seria una nación modelo de Dios sobre la Tierra y demostraría al resto de la humanidad cómo comportarse. Esta nación era la judía.\"\nhttps://www.tora.org.ar/pueblo-elegido-y-su-mision/\nSi eso no es considerar a un pueblo por encima del resto, da lugar a suficientes malas interpretaciones como para llamarles supemacistas.\nNo hay religión buena, no hay fanático respetable.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando.

Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia.

    "title": "Homes in four Ontario First Nations have dangerous levels of carbon dioxide, mould | Canada's National Observer: Climate News",
    "text": "A study has found air inside homes on four remote First Nations in northwestern Ontario contained carbon dioxide , fine particles, mould and other substances that increase the risk of respiratory infections .\nThe report’s author, David Miller, a distinguished research professor at Carleton University, says there are ways to improve ventilation.\n“This is an opportunity not a black hole,” said Miller.\n The study published last month tested the air in 101 homes on Lac Seul First Nation , Kasabonika Lake First Nation, Sandy Lake First Nation and Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation. Three of the communities aren’t accessible by road except during a short time in winter.\nAbout 27 per cent of the homes had elevated levels of carbon dioxide. Almost half had visible mould.\n“Ten per cent of the houses have enough mould damage that they should be fixed today, not tomorrow,” Miller said.\nHe said researchers also found endotoxin levels higher than in any previous study in Canada. Levels of the bacterial compound were 1,000 times higher than Miller said he has ever seen. When concentrations of endotoxins are high, they can impact lung function and cause a greater response to allergens, particularly in children.\n Quebec reaches tentative deal with labour unions on working conditions only By Jacob Serebrin | News , Politics | December 28th 2023 Endotoxins can come from things like pets, humidifiers, firewood stored indoors and cigarette smoke. They are also more likely in rural areas rather than cities.\nA related 2022 study of children from the same four First Nations in the Sioux Lookout region found that 21 per cent had been admitted to hospital for respiratory infections before the age of two. That study pointed to serious housing concerns as a contributing factor to health problems.\nHigh levels of #CarbonDioxide, #Mould found in homes on #Ontario reserves: study. #FirstNations #HousingStudy #RespiratoryInfections Housing on First Nations has been a long-standing issue across the country. Statistics Canada says more than one in five First Nations people live in overcrowded houses. More than one-third of people living on reserves are in homes in need of major repairs.\nMany Indigenous leaders have said mould and dampness continue to plague homes on First Nations. Miller said other factors, including wood stoves for heating and inadequate ventilation, are also connected to poor air quality.\nMiller said researchers for the latest study were granted permission from the communities, leadership and families living in the homes, predominately small detached bungalows. The project was developed under the guidance of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation , which represents First Nations in northern Ontario, and the Sioux Lookout First Nations Health Authority.\nForty-four per cent of the homes in the study had a heat recovery ventilator system, or HRV. Eight per cent of the systems were in good working condition.\nThe study says most of the HRVs were installed in crawl spaces, so they weren't easy to access for filter cleaning and maintenance. Some were installed improperly and others were not turned on at all.\nThe study found most of the homes needed minor repairs and about half needed major repairs — some urgently.\nThe location and isolation of the communities makes those repairs difficult, Miller said.\n“It's not like they can go to Canadian Tire down the street,” he said.\nNishnawbe Aski Nation declared a housing state of emergency in 2014. Last year, chiefs called on the federal and provincial governments to support a First Nation-designed strategy to address the housing crisis.\nMiller said an ideal solution would be to have adequate housing on First Nations across the country. The study can help inform how homes are built in the future, including the location of HRVs, he added.\nMiller said things can also be done to make the current situation healthier for families living in the homes.\nVentilation systems can be properly installed and maintained, he said, and mould can be managed.\nAnother important factor is education. Miller said researchers partnered with three Indigenous women from the communities to create materials about how to lessen the risks from wood stoves and mould, as well as information about how to maintain HRVs. The materials were also translated into Oji-Cree, the language used on the First Nations.\nTaking these steps will not make the homes perfect, Miller said.\n“But it will make a big difference in the health of those kids.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.",

    "text": "San Francisco: The US government efficiency czar Elon Musk, in his lawsuit against Sam Altman-run OpenAI for abandoning its non-profit stance, has now named new defendants including Microsoft, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and former OpenAI board member and senior Microsoft executive, Dee Templeton.\nThe amended complaint, filed in a district court in California, also names new plaintiffs — Neuralink executive and ex-OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis and Musk’s AI company, xAI.\n“OpenAI, co-founded by Musk as an independent charity committed to safety and transparency — and nurtured in its infancy by Musk’s money, advice, recruiting efforts and connections — is, at the direction of Altman, Brockman, and Microsoft, fast becoming a fully for-profit subsidiary of Microsoft,” the lawsuit read.\nMusk’s lawyers argued that OpenAI is “actively trying to eliminate competitors” such as xAI by “extracting promises from investors not to fund them.”\nThe lawsuit further alleged that “never before has a corporation gone from tax-exempt charity to a $157 billion for-profit, market-paralysing gorgon — and in just eight years”.\n“Never before has it happened, because doing so violates almost every principle of law governing economic activity. It requires lying to donors, lying to members, lying to markets, lying to regulators, and lying to the public,” it read.\nAccording to the amended complaint, Zilis, who stepped down from OpenAI’s board in 2023, has standing as an “injured employee” under California Corporations Code. Zilis has close ties to Musk, having worked as a project director at Tesla from 2017 to 2019 in addition to directing Neuralink research.\nThe lawsuit further alleged that the efforts by Altman and his cohorts to cash in and squeeze others out have their roots in OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft.\n“Together, they established an opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates, the only value of which came from looting OpenAI, Inc. of the intellectual property, employees, and relationships developed by exploiting Musk’s name and contributions, the charity’s tax status, and the goodwill generated by its supposed philanthropic commitment,” alleged the Musk lawsuit.\nWhile the tech billionaire had expressed an affinity for Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella, “the values of Microsoft and OpenAI did not align”.\nWhereas Musk was concerned that AI posed an existential danger to humankind and believed the technology should be decentralised and open, “Nadella and Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates minimised Musk’s concerns as ‘panic’ and too far off in the future,” the lawsuit said.\nMicrosoft was yet to comment on the amended lawsuit.",

This series is stabby, shooty, and horny, and you know you need it.\n\"Hearing that FRANK MILLER enjoyed the debut issue of FALLING IN LOVE ON THE PATH TO HELL sent me into orbit. Frank's directly responsible for my brain marinating in samurai culture, Ronin is a timeless masterpiece and his indelible overs to the American reprints of Lone Wolf and Cub were my gateway into one of the best comics ever made. It's not hyperbole to say our comic wouldn't exist without the inspiration from Frank. Our entire team is delighted and grateful that Frank is sharing his talent on a guest cover for the start of our second arc. A true dream come true.\" —GERRY DUGGAN\nRetail: $3.99 In-Store Date: 10/16/2024",
