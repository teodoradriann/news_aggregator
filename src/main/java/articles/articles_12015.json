    "text": "ST. CLOUD, Minn. — A Waite Park man was sentenced Thursday to more than six years for an attempted 2021 St. Cloud bank robbery in which he took multiple hostages.\nRay McNeary, 39, took five hostages at a Wells Fargo bank on May 6, 2021. The criminal complaint said he was speaking to a bank manager about potential fraud on his account, and became upset when the manager couldn't find his account.\nThe manager hit the silent panic alarm and several customers fled the building, but five employees remained inside. McNeary then demanded $60,000 in cash from the vault.\nThe complaint went on to say that McNeary allegedly told the hostages that he was going to harm them and he wanted a \"big show\" with the FBI and media and that he would take the victims \"with him.\"\nMcNeary held a pair of scissors against the bank manager's neck and back, charges said. Four employees were able to leave the bank during the 8-hour standoff , which eventually ended when the bank manager fled and law enforcement were able to move in and arrest McNeary. The bank employees were unharmed.\nHe pleaded guilty to one count of armed bank robbery in March. He was sentenced to six years and six months in prison, five years of supervised release and must pay $8,210 in restitution.\nMore from CBS News Country music singer Creed Fisher seriously hurt in motorcycle crash near St. Cloud Video shows 8-year-old girl using bat to help fight off armed robber at Twin Cities liquor store Kandiyohi County deputy charged with DWI after rolling squad car multiple times 5 juveniles arrested after allegedly speeding through Edina in stolen vehicles Man convicted in killings of 3 men near Wisconsin quarry WCCO Staff The WCCO Staff is a group of experienced journalists who bring you the content on WCCO.com.\nTwitter Facebook Instagram",

    "text": "- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced sweeping firings at the Health and Human Services Department.\n- HHS will fire roughly 10,000 workers, per the announcement.\n- Kennedy is also creating a new agency that will streamline his MAHA initiative.\nThe Health and Human Services Department will lay off roughly 10,000 federal workers, part of a major reorganization led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nThe announcement is one of the largest mass firings to be announced since President Donald Trump took office and tasked each Cabinet department to work with the White House DOGE office.\nAccording to HHS, the firings will save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year. With previous reductions and early retirements, HHS will have slashed nearly 20,000 workers.\n\"We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,\" Kennedy said in a statement. \"This Department will do more — a lot more — at a lower cost to the taxpayer.\"\nAs part of Kennedy's mission, the department will create an Administration for a Healthy America that will combine multiple agencies, including the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, into one entity.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, long the gold standard, will be refocused on preventing epidemics.\nKennedy's announcement comes shortly after Senate lawmakers confirmed the top two members of his team, FDA Commissioner and National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.",

    "text": "A new study\npublished in Social Indicators Research found that pet companionship leads to a 3 to 4 points boost in life satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 7. Additionally, the value of a pet was calculated as the equivalent of earning $100,000 USD per year in added life satisfaction. These aren't small improvements in quality of life – they're huge.\nRELATED:\nThe 20 Most Dog-Friendly Countries In The World.\nThe UK-based researchers Michael W. Gmeiner and Adelina Gschwandtner built on\nearlier research that has found animals can reduce stress symptoms for humans. For example, the simple action of petting or viewing an animal has been shown to decrease blood pressure and heart rate.\nGmeiner and Gschwandtner used survey data from the\nUK Household Longitudinal Study to form the basis of their work. That survey of more than 700 people looked at the correlation of demographic data with pet ownership, along with personality traits and social behavior. The emotional impact and longterm effects of pet ownership are particularly notable.\nThe research applied to both cats and dogs, and there wasn't any added benefit of one over the other (so the\ncats vs. dogs debate can rage on). While other pets like fish, rabbits, and reptiles are believed to have significance, there was not enough data to make conclusions on their benefits.\nPets have a \"calming presence\" and \"ease feelings of loneliness,\"\nper UC Davis Health. It's part of why pet therapy has become so popular and it's a proven effective strategy to care for elderly, leading to better integration and socialization skills, creating a deeper feeling of belonging and sharing, and improving quality of life.\nPets have\nadditional benefits for children, such as teaching them about responsibilities, taking their mind off of stressful situations, and creating a bond for social interaction.\nThe new research puts a monetary value on that satisfaction of having a pet, which is on par with a happy\nmajor life event like marriage.\nWhat are the main benefits of pets for mental health?\nThe research is also in line with the\nAmerican Heart Association's list of five benefits of pets for mental health:\n- Reduce work-related stress.\n- Increase productivity.\n- Manage anxiety.\n- Be more active.\n- Create a sense of togetherness.\nHow many Americans have a pet?\nOf 128 million households, an estimated 94 million (73%) own a pet,\naccording to the 2025 APPA National Pet Owners Survey. That breaks down to mostly dogs (68 million) and cats (49 million) with fish, birds, reptiles, and horses in the mix at smaller levels.",
