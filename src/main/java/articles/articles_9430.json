    "title": "Gerwyn Price suffers shock Ally Pally exit as Luke Humphries survives huge scare | The Independent",
    "text": "Fifth seed and former champion Gerwyn Price was dumped out of the World Darts Championship after a 4-2 defeat to Northern Irishman Brendan Dolan.Dolan held his nerve to close out the match with his first shot at tops after Price had clawed his way back from two legs down to level in the sixth set.It was a crushing defeat for Welshman Price, who had been intent on repeating his victory in the behind-closed-doors tournament in 2021.Dolan, who got through his second-round match via a sudden death leg against his compatriot Mickey Mansell, had served an early warning when he took out the opening set with a 144 checkout.His crisp finishing proved the difference as he nudged in front again at 2-1 on the bull, and 64 to repel Price’s advances to go 3-2 up and one set from victory.Dolan looked set to be made to pay for missing a match-dart at bull at 2-0 in the sixth when Price hit back to break his throw, but the 50-year-old form Enniskillen saw it home in style.Dolan told Sky Sports: “I was thinking we might go to a last leg but thank god it didn’t because I don’t know if I would have held myself together.”Brendan Dolan celebrated one of the biggest wins of his career Another of the favourites for the title, Luke Humphries came perilously close to joining Price in an early exit but somehow came from 3-1 down to edge past Ricardo Pietreczko 4-3.Humphries has been cleaning up at the big events this season to become bookies’ favourite to lift the Sid Waddell Trophy at Alexandra Palace but showed little of that form as, after winning the opening set, he watched his German opponent win nine of the next 12 legs to move just a set away from victory.When the Englishman was then broken at the start of the fifth set, the game looked to be up, especially as he was seemingly badly affected by a vociferous pro-Pietreczko crowd – many of whom travelled over from Germany – constantly whistling and jeering him.But he dug deep to break straight back, edged the deciding leg in that set to narrow the gap to 3-2 and then won six of the next seven legs to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat before eschewing his normally mild-mannered approach to exuberantly celebrate in front of those who had been supporting his opponent.Humphries will now face Joe Cullen in the last 16 and if he does go on to lift the title, may well look back at this narrow escape as the turning point in his championship. Chris Dobey overcame a scare from Ross Smith to win 4-2 in the highlight of the afternoon session.A back-and-forth contest that saw 27 maximums posted throughout saw Dobey march into a 2-0 lead before being pegged back by Smith.Another tight set saw Dobey edge ahead and he hit double 16 for the match to set up a meeting with reigning world champion Michael Smith in the last 16. Stephen Bunting set up a last-16 clash with Michael van Gerwen after a stunning 4-0 win over Florian Hempel.Bunting, the former BDO champion, nudged the opener 3-2 and from there the momentum was firmly with him as he swept Hempel away with a whitewash, averaging 101.15 throughout.Another close contest saw Joe Cullen reach the next round with a 4-2 win over Ryan Searle.Brendan Dolan celebrated one of the biggest wins of his career 2021 champion Gerwyn Price crashed out at the hands of Brendan Dolan Want today.",

    "title": "Attorney General Henry Announces MOU with U.S. Department of Transportation that will Promote Fair Treatment of Air Travelers",
    "text": "HARRISBURG — Attorney General Michelle Henry announced the reinforcement of a partnership with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to review and resolve consumer complaints against airlines and ticket agents. The two agencies signed a\nmemorandum of understanding with a commitment to achieving a common goal: assurance that consumers are treated fairly.\nThe MOU outlines how the Office of Attorney General and DOT will work together to review consumer complaints and identify violations of federal aviation consumer protection requirements.\nPennsylvania is one of 15 states that signed an MOU with the DOT, at a time when flight disruptions, difficulty getting refunds, and lost or delayed baggage remain core concerns for travelers.\nAttorney General Henry praised the new coordinated effort that will provide better protection to millions of U.S. airline passengers.\n“This memorandum is a message to airline companies and ticket agents that consumer complaints must be taken seriously,” Attorney General Henry said. “At a time when passenger concerns about air travel are climbing and just as we are about to enter the busy summer travel season, airlines must be attentive to consumer comfort and inform the Department of Transportation about major issues. I am proud to be part of a coordinated effort to protect millions of air travelers.”\nUnited States Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said: “We take our mission to protect consumers seriously, and today’s launch of the Airline Passenger Protection Partnership is an important milestone in that effort. By partnering with a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, the U.S. Department of Transportation has expanded our ability to hold airlines and ticket agents accountable and protect passengers from unfair or deceptive practices.”\nFederal law places the central responsibility for protecting airline consumers with the DOT. Under this historic agreement, the Office of Attorney General will be authorized to investigate consumer complaints against air carriers, ticket agents, and other air travel companies supervised by the DOT.\nThe Office of Attorney General will work with consumers and companies to resolve complaints, and if necessary, will refer complaints to the DOT’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection (OACP). The OACP will prioritize their review, include Office of Attorney General staff on letters of inquiry to those companies based on referrals, and consult with the Office of Attorney General before determining next steps.\nThe DOT will also provide technical assistance and training to Office of Attorney General staff and meet regularly with the office to discuss complaints and responses.\nThe MOU will last for two years, and Pennsylvania and the DOT may agree to extend it at two-year intervals after the agreement ends.\nPreviously, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General has urged the federal government to strengthen protections for airline passengers and\nasked Congress to authorize state attorneys general enforcement of federal consumer protection laws governing the airline industry.\nOthers that have signed an MOU with the DOT include Attorneys General from California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New York, New Hampshire, North Carolina, the Northern Mariana Islands, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Wisconsin.\n# # #",

    "title": "DC Weather Alert: Evening Storms Followed by Searing Heat This Weekend",
    "text": "Weather Update: Storms and Rising Temperatures Ahead As we approach the weekend, the weather forecast indicates a mix of evening storms followed by a significant rise in temperatures. Residents in the D.C. area should prepare for a weather shift, with a heat advisory in effect for the upcoming days. Meteorologists predict temperatures nearing the 100-degree mark, prompting warnings for extreme heat conditions.\nEvening Storms and Heat Advisory Forecasters are alerting the public to a couple of evening storms, which are expected to bring brief but intense rainfall. Following these storms, a heat advisory will be in effect, with temperatures expected to soar. This combination of weather conditions will create a challenging environment for many, particularly for those with outdoor plans.\nImplications of Rising Temperatures The forecasted heat wave raises significant concerns regarding public health and safety. Heat-related illnesses are a serious risk, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. It is crucial for the community to stay informed and take necessary precautions, such as staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous outdoor activities during peak heat hours.\nEmerging Trends in Weather Patterns As extreme weather events become increasingly common, the implications for urban planning and public health are profound. Cities are grappling with the need to adapt to these changing conditions, which may include enhancing green spaces to mitigate heat and investing in public cooling centers. The rise in temperatures and the frequency of storms may also lead to a greater emphasis on renewable energy sources, as communities seek to reduce their carbon footprints and combat climate change.\nRecommendations for the Community Stay informed by regularly checking weather updates and alerts. Plan outdoor activities for the cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or late evening. Ensure access to cooling spaces, particularly for those who may be vulnerable to heat-related illnesses. Encourage community engagement in climate resilience initiatives, such as tree planting and urban greening projects. As we navigate these weather challenges, it is essential for communities to come together, share resources, and adapt to the changing climate. The combination of storms and extreme heat is a reminder of the need for preparedness and resilience in the face of increasingly unpredictable weather patterns.",

    "text": "Il va falloir attendre pour se procurer des stylos d’adrénaline injectable Anapen. L’Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament (ANSM) a indiqué jeudi les importantes tensions d’approvisionnement de ces médicaments, dont « la remise à disposition complète est prévue au cours du premier trimestre 2025 ». « Les trois dosages sont concernés », a précisé l’ANSM. Les stylos Anapen 300 microgrammes (µg) sont « dès à présent » en rupture d’approvisionnement et « à partir de septembre, les stylos 150 µg et 500 µg seront également en rupture », prévient l’ANSM sur son site. Ces stylos auto-injecteurs sont indiqués dans le traitement d’urgence des symptômes du choc anaphylactique, potentiellement mortel et qui constitue une urgence médicale absolue. Les difficultés d’approvisionnement en auto-injecteurs d’adrénaline sont récurrentes. Une rupture liée à « un transfert de site de production » Les allergènes à l’origine de ces chocs anaphylactiques les plus fréquents sont des aliments (tels que cacahuètes, pistaches, crustacés, œufs etc.), les venins de guêpe, d’abeille ou de frelons, des médicaments et le latex, selon l’Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (Inserm). « Cette rupture n’est pas due à un défaut qualité » mais attribuée à « un transfert de site de production qui a conduit à un retard d’approvisionnements des stylos Anapen » commercialisés par le laboratoire Bioprojet, précise le gendarme du médicament. « Pour pallier ces ruptures temporaires, les patients traités par Anapen se verront prescrire, lors de leur prochaine consultation, un stylo auto-injecteur d’adrénaline d’une autre marque, à savoir Epipen ou Jext », souligne l’ANSM.",
