    "text": "Winter storm affecting those northwest of the Fox Valley\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - Snow conditions are continuing to get worse, especially for those northwest of the Fox Valley.\nJust when you thought spring was finally here with the warmer temperatures last week, Mother Nature said “sike” and gave us another snowstorm.\nIn Shawano, it’s a winter wonderland…in March, and that means not putting the shovels and snowblowers away quite yet.\n“This is my third time I’ve done this already. And I’ll probably be out here another two more times yet,” Bill Scholar of Shawano said.\nPeople are sick of the snow and ready for spring.\n“Well, I want it to go away forever! No more snow! It is affecting our business and we’re done with snow. We want spring,” Annette Lenss of Shawano said.\n“I think I’m ready for spring cause the snow was almost gone and now we got this now again,” Scholar said.\nLenss owns a store in downtown Shawano and she says this weather is not helping her business in the slightest.\n“It’s very slow today. I would be lucky if my Lindaman’s pickup comes in today from Green Bay. It’s that slow,” Lenss said.\nLuckily for Lenss, she didn’t have to worry about a long commute to work, especially with these road conditions.\n“Well, thankfully I live close so it wasn’t too bad but I know it is really slippery out there, even the short distance I had to go,” Lenss said.\nCopyright 2025 WBAY.

    "title": "Beast from the East snow could return in January after Met Officer warning - MyLondon",
    "text": "One of the leading weather forecasters has warned that conditions that caused the &apos;Beast from the East&apos; could lead to snow hitting Europe in January. The Met Office has said there is a &apos;greater than normal&apos; risk of snow next month, but the forecaster is not quite sure exactly where the snow will strike.\nThese conditions being forecasted could land the UK in a deep freeze, according to Sky News. This is due to a change in wind patterns high up in the atmosphere, and is due to &apos;sudden stratospheric warming&apos;, the Met Office has explained.\nThis has been forecast for early January, and could see parts of the country facing some brutally cold temperatures the following week. Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, said: \"When you get an SSW it increases the likelihood of a prolonged cold spell across Northern Europe, like the Beast from the East.\"\nREAD MORE: New London weather map shows blanket of snow for 4 whole days in January\nForecasters aren&apos;t exactly sure when this cold snap will happen (Image: Tim Robberts) However, the Met Office aren&apos;t yet sure if this is even going to happen. A spokesperson for the weather forecaster said it&apos;s currently too early to tell what&apos;s going to happen, or where it might hit.\nA sudden stratospheric warming happens when polar vortex winds in the stratosphere stop, slow or reverse direction. This causes rapid warming in the stratosphere but then has a knock-on effect by disrupting the jet stream a few weeks later.\nWhen the jet stream is disrupted, it allows cold air to travel further south in part of the Northern Hemisphere, hitting parts of Europe with a freezing spell of cold weather. However, forecasters can&apos;t tell when this is going to happen yet.\nA cold spell is currently forecast for the second week of January, but it could end up being later or last longer. The Met Office&apos;s current long-range forecast for January 12 through to January 26 says: \"Compared to normal, there is an increased chance of colder than average conditions during this period, and a reduced chance of prolonged periods of very unsettled / milder conditions with frequent rain and wind pushing in from the Atlantic.\n\"Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.\"\nGot a story for us?

Despite being originally scheduled for a 10 a.m. CT first pitch, the SEC announced that Thursday's game is delayed due to rain in Auburn. First pitch is tentatively scheduled for 5 p.m., per LSU. LSU will get some much-needed rest ahead of Thursday's game. The Tigers outlasted Alabama in an instant classic, with Taylor Pleasants walking off the longest game by innings in SEC Tournament history with a bases-loaded single in the bottom of the 14th. Tennessee earned a first-round bye by virtue of its 19-5 conference record, good enough to claim the top seed in the tournament. The Tigers traveled to Knoxville to face the Volunteers in late April, but dropped two of three games. Tennessee took the Friday and Sunday games, both by 3-0 scores.

    "text": "¿Por qué recomiendan DESACTIVAR Meta AI de WhatsApp 2024? Te decimos Algunas personas han destacado ciertas desventajas que tiene el uso de la inteligencia artificial de WhatsApp. El avance de la tecnología ha permeado en múltiples plataformas y aplicaciones digitales, tal como ocurre con WhatsApp y el arribo de su inteligencia artificial denominada como [Meta AI](https://www.mediotiempo.com/otros-mundos/whatsapp-estas-son-las-preguntas-y-temas-prohibidos-en-meta-ia?utm_cmp_rs=Nota%20Enlace%20Editorial). A pesar de ser una herramienta que puede proporcionar cierta utilidad a los usuarios digitales, algunos han puntualizado que Meta AI ha generado ciertas problemáticas a la hora de utilizarla. Aquí te compartimos cuáles han sido las inconformidades de diversas personas y por qué recomiendan desactivarla en WhatsApp. ¿Por qué piden desactivar Meta AI? Tras haber aplicado su actualización, WhatsApp implementó dentro del programa de mensajería la opción de utilizar Meta AI como una herramienta para consultar dudas de diversos tópicos. Sin embargo, muchos usuarios han advertido que existen una serie de desventajas a la hora de hacer uso de este programa, entre los cuales destacan los siguientes: Poca precisión y veracidad en datos de la IA: en algunos casos se ha destacado la difusión de información falsa o de dudosa fuente a la hora de ser proporcionada por Meta AI. Daño al ambiente: el uso de la inteligencia artificial puede llegar a consumir hasta la mitad de la carga de los dispositivos móviles, destacando esto a través de la generación de imágenes con la IA. Genera distracciones: utilizar demasiado tiempo Meta AI puede ser un factor de distracción, por lo que las actividades o tareas de las personas pueden verse interrumpidas si se enajenan con el uso de la herramienta. Monotonía creativa: para muchos, Meta AI carece de un estilo variado a la hora de proporcionar respuestas o contenido gráfico, por lo que muchos aseguran que esta función está programada para brindar respuestas básicas y puntuales sobre diversos temas. Limita la innovación: Meta AI no es considerada con limitaciones creativas únicamente, sino que también puede generar un impacto nocivo en la curiosidad humana. Al brindar una síntesis sobre temas de gran trascendencia, las personas creen que esto puede acabar con el interés de profundizar y debatir más allá de las primeras impresiones sobre ciertos tópicos. Además, otra de las dudas que ha generado el uso de Meta AI es la pérdida de privacidad informática, aunque WhatsApp asegura que los chats cuentan con un cifrado extremo a extremo, lo cual prohibe a la inteligencia artificial leer o analizar los mensajes de los usuarios. ¿Cómo desactivar Meta AI? Ante todo este contexto de dudas y opiniones, muchos han optado por seguir la recomendación de desactivar la inteligencia artificial de WhatsApp. La desactivación de Meta AI ayuda a tener menos contacto con ella, aunque no es posible eliminarla por completo de la app. Estos son los pasos que debes seguir si deseas desactivar Meta AI de WhatsApp: - Abre la conversación con Meta AI en WhatsApp. - Tocar el botón de los tres puntos verticales en la parte superior derecha. - Presiona la opción Eliminar conversación o Eliminar chat. - Confirma que deseas borrar el chat. Aunque sigas estos pasos, la barra de búsqueda en la parte superior de WhatsApp seguirá presente. Dicha herramienta no se puede eliminar y, en caso de oprimirla por error, la conversación volverá a aparecer. Para ello puedes también silenciar el chat con Meta AI para siempre y archivarlo para no tenerlo en tu bandeja principal. Estos serían los pasos para hacerlo: - Abre la conversación con Meta AI. - Mantén apretado el chat hasta que aparezca la opción de Silenciar notificaciones y seleccionar la opción Siempre. - Después deberás volver a mantener apretado el chat y clickear en los tres puntos de la parte superior derecha, para seleccionar la opción de Archivar chat. - - - - - - [¡Ni Mahomes, ni Lamar!

    "text": "Two weeks before the big day, and David Phillips is already getting asked the big question.\nWill it be a white Christmas?\nWhen it comes to Niagara, the senior climatologist with Environment Canada is hesitant to give an answer — especially this far out. However, he said, all the evidence so far this month, combined with the slightly easier to predict temperature forecasts, suggest a blanket of snow on the ground is not likely in the offing when Niagarans wake up on Christmas morning.\n“We’re not seeing a huge chance,” he said. “There are a couple teasers in the offing if we look two weeks ahead.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW So far in December, temperatures have been about two degrees above normal. Phillips said this comes after a fall that has been the warmest on record. It’s also been a dry one, with very little in way of significant rainfall.\n“It’s been a dry fall,” he said. “And going into December, there may have been some rain, flurries and that, but the total amount of precipitation has gone way down. We’re into almost an invisible kind of drought across Ontario, really.”\nIf it is indeed a green Christmas in Niagara this year, it’ll simply be the continuation of a pattern. Over the last 10 years, there have only been four white Christmases, which Phillips said is defined by having at least two centimetres of snow on the ground — not really enough to go tobogganing, but enough at least to make the picture outside more white than green or brown.\nIn Niagara, he said, a white Christmas simply cannot be counted on even more.\n“I often say that instead of dreaming about it, we have to pray for it because in the last several years, it really has been a lot more green than white,” Phillips said.\nInstead, what Niagara can expect to see is what Phillips calls “yo-yo weather”: temperatures dipping a few degrees below freezing and then going back up again. He said there’s bound to be some snow in the next couple of weeks, though he doubts there will be much more than flurries.\nThat being said, Phillips pointed out that two weeks from now, he could very well have egg on his face. Niagara could very well be hit by a storm that hasn’t been born yet, but suddenly develops in the U.S. before moving up here.\n“A Colorado low or a Texan Panhandler coming in the area, bumping into some arctic air, coming and settling in — all of a sudden, you get dumped on. Those things have happened,” he said.\n“But I’m looking ahead, and this is what I see. I don’t see anything ominous with regards to major systems and a kind of bouncing back and forth in terms of temperatures.”",
