[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 16-02-2024 08:57 IST | Created: 16-02-2024 08:57 IST - Country: - India Solar and battery storage are poised to dominate new electricity generation in the United States in 2024, according to recent data released by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, with developers and power plant owners gearing up to add a substantial 62.8 gigawatts (GW) of capacity this year, solar and batteries will collectively account for an impressive 81 per cent of this new capacity, marking a significant shift towards renewable energy sources. The EIA's report, released on February 15, outlines a notable surge in capacity additions compared to the previous year. In 2023, 40.4 GW of new capacity was added, marking the highest increase since 2003. However, 2024 is expected to surpass this figure by a staggering 55 per cent, highlighting the accelerating pace of renewable energy deployment. Among the new capacity additions, solar projects are set to lead the charge, accounting for 36.4 GW, or 58 per cent of the total, followed closely by battery storage projects with 14.3 GW, constituting 23 per cent of the total. Wind energy, while still significant, will see a decrease in capacity additions compared to previous years, with 62.8 GW expected to be added in 2024. EIA said, \"Developers and power plant owners plan to add 62.8 GW of capacity in 2024\". Notably, natural gas capacity additions are at a 25-year low, reflecting the increasing shift towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. The modest increase in nuclear capacity stems from the addition of a fourth reactor at Georgia's Vogtle nuclear power plant. Texas and California emerge as the leading states in terms of new capacity additions, with Texas slated to host 35 per cent of new solar projects and California accounting for 10 per cent. These two states will also drive the growth of battery storage, with a combined 82 per cent of new capacity expected in 2024. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, California and Texas already lead in operating battery storage capacity, with 8.3 GW and 5.1 GW, respectively. The surge in solar and battery storage projects underscores the ongoing transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure in the United States. \"Natural gas capacity additions are at a 25-year low in 2024\", EIA said. With renewable energy sources increasingly becoming the cornerstone of the nation's electricity generation, the shift towards a cleaner and greener future appears to be gaining momentum.

    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil's federal police are investigating the country's former intelligence chief as part of a wider probe into alleged spying on political opponents under former President Jair Bolsonaro, court records showed Thursday.\nThe former intelligence chief, Alexandre Ramagem, was among those targeted by the 21 search warrants that the Supreme Court authorized and that were carried out by police early Thursday morning.\nPolice are investigating an ''organized crime'' group that operated within the intelligence agency, known by its Portuguese acronym ABIN, during Ramagem's tenure, according to a police statement.\nThe group essentially ran a ''parallel structure'' within ABIN, using the agency's tools and services ''for illicit actions, producing information for political and media use, to obtain personal benefits and interfere with police investigations,'' it said.\nPolice suspect Ramagem used a software known as FirstMile, developed by Israeli company Cognyte, ''to monitor targets and public authorities ... with the aim of creating false narratives,\" according to Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes' 38-page decision authorizing the warrants.\nThe document also detailed the group's purported modus operandi.\nWhile some officers were allegedly tasked with merely monitoring targets and producing reports, others allegedly took steps to fabricate links between targets — such as lawmakers and Supreme Court Justices — and drug traffickers.\nPolice also said their investigations showed that the group allegedly sought to interfere in several police investigations, including some that targeted or involved two of Bolsonaro's sons, Jair Renan and Flávio, a sitting senator.\nRamagem denied having accessed, used or managed the system in question in an interview with television network GloboNews on Thursday.\nHe said he reviewed legal documents that led to the search, and that they contained ''a salad of narratives, even old and resolved ones, put there to criminally accuse us without proof.''\nThe Globo television network reported in October that ABIN personnel employed the tracking software more than 30,000 times, of which 1,800 targeted politicians, journalists, lawyers and opponents of Bolsonaro's government.\nBolsonaro appointed Ramagem to lead ABIN in May 2019. The right-wing leader had previously appointed him to be federal police chief, but quickly yielded to growing criticism around the nomination due to the fact that Ramagem was widely seen as too close to the president's family, and that he might give members preferential treatment.\nIn October, Brazil's police arrested two people and carried out 25 search warrants related to the investigation.\nDe Moraes, the Supreme Court justice, on Jan. 22 authorized the search and seizure of documents, cell phones, computers, tablets and others electronic devices of 12 individuals, totaling 21 warrants. He also granted the federal police's request to prevent Ramagem and others from leaving capital Brasilia without previous authorization, or from accessing any federal police buildings without having been summoned.\nDe Moraes did not address a request that Ramagem, now a federal lawmaker, be suspended from his duties.\nRamagem is also a pre-candidate for mayor in Rio de Janeiro, with elections slated for October.\nLocal paper O Globo reported that Bolsonaro's son, Carlos, will coordinate Ramagem's social media during his campaign.",

[PTI](/pti-stories)| Lucknow | Updated: 29-12-2023 15:44 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 15:20 IST - Country: - India Ahead of the consecration ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the sale of liquor has been banned on the Panchkosi Parikrama Marg of the temple town, Uttar Pradesh Minister Nitin Agarwal said. The ''pran pratishtha'', or the consecration ceremony of the Ram Lalla idol, will take part on January 22 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take part in it. ''Ayodhya is a major pilgrimage place where people from the entire country and the world arrive to have a glimpse of Ram Lalla. Under the guidance of Chief Minister (Yogi Adityanath), it was decided to ban the sale of liquor on Ayodhya's Panchkosi Parikrama Marg,'' said Agarwal, the minister of state (independent charge) for Excise and Prohibition. ''A prohibition has been declared there. All wine shops there have been removed and nobody will (be allowed to) open liquor shops there,'' he said on Thursday. According to Mahant Raju Das of the Hanumangarhi temple, Panchkosi Parikrama takes place on the 'ekadashi' after Diwali. Devotees undertaking the parikrama cover a distance of around 50 kilometres.
