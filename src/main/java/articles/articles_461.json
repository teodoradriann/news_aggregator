    "text": "Furto ai danni della chiesa Regina Pacis di Giarre, nel Catanese. I ladri si sono intrufolati nella notte all’interno del luogo sacro e hanno rubato una serie di oggetti religiosi il cui valore complessivo ammonta a oltre 5000 euro. A fare l’amara scoperta stamani è stato Salvo Mancuso, consigliere parrocchiale, che ha aperto le porte e ha trovato i locali sottosopra.\nProfanato anche il tabernacolo, contenente le ostie consacrate. Tra gli oggetti trafugati ci sarebbero paramenti, calici, pissidi, ampolline, l’aspersorio, altri oggetti in ottone e argento e una cassa bluetooth. Sul posto i carabinieri per un sopralluogo e i rilievi e per acquisire le immagini delle telecamere della zona. Avvisati anche padre Taddeo Ambet, parroco della chiesa, in questo momento fuori sede, e il vescovo di Acireale.\nL’episodio ha creato sconcerto in tutta la comunità parrocchiale. Rammarico per il grave episodio è stato espresso dal presidente del Consiglio comunale, Giovanni Barbagallo. “Rubare in una chiesa è un atto vile e vergognoso – commenta -. Subire un furto è sempre odioso ma lo diventa ancor di più quando questo viene commesso a danno di una parrocchia privata di paramenti e oggettistica sacra spesso donata dai fedeli stessi. Esprimo profonda vicinanza e solidarietà nei confronti dei padri bocconisti e di tutta la comunità parrocchiale di Regina Pacis. L’augurio – conclude il presidente del Consiglio – è che le forze dell’ordine, sempre presenti e attive sul territorio, riescano a rintracciare e ad assicurare alla giustizia i responsabili”.",

    "title": "António Laureano. \"As ondas da Nazaré são as melhores do mundo\"",
    "text": "Com apenas 21 anos, António Laureano enfrenta o Canhão da Nazaré com a maior naturalidade do mundo, mas ainda não encontrou a expressão certa para descrever o que sente quando desce pelas maiores ondas do mundo. Só de ver mete medo!\nA Praia do Norte, na Nazaré, é a Meca do surf de ondas gigantes. Quando há um swell colossal é ver os big riders, como são conhecidos os surfistas que praticam a disciplina mais perigosa do surf, a entrar na água e enfrentar ondas bravias que chegam aos 30 metros de altura! A época de espera da Big Wave Challenge começou a 1 novembro e termina dia 31 de março de 2024. É nesse período que aparecem estas ondas devido às tempestades de inverno que ocorrem no norte do Oceano Atlântico e desencadeiam uma série de fenómenos marítimos que resultam num espetáculo de invulgar beleza e grandiosidade. O que faz com que essas ondas sejam muito maiores nesta zona do que em outros lugares da costa portuguesa é a presença de um desfiladeiro submerso chamado canhão Canhão da Nazaré. Surfar no Canhão da Nazaré é como escalar o Evereste, centenas de aventureiros tentam, mas apenas os melhores conseguem.\nAlgures nesse período vai acontecer o grande dia na Praia do Norte, ponto de encontro dos corajosos que participam nos eventos de ondas grandes da liga mundial de surf, onde participam 36 surfistas (14 homens e 12 mulheres) na busca de sensações e de recordes. Os big riders têm o paradoxal desejo de as surfar e, ao mesmo tempo, o medo de as encarar.\nGarrett McNamara foi o primeiro a enamorar-se por essas ondas gigantes. Levou algum tempo a preparar a aventura, e quando o fez, em 2011, entrou no Guinness Book por ter surfado uma onda com 23,7 metros de altura, a partir dessa vaga a Nazaré nunca mais foi a mesma. Essa marca foi depois batida por três vezes, o recorde atual pertence a Sebastian Steudtner que, em 2020, surfou uma onda com 26,2 metros.\nAntónio Laureano está à procura da oportunidade para fazer aquilo de que mais gosta, “surfar nas melhores ondas gigantes do mundo”, afirmou à LUZ convicto. Vem de uma família ligada ao surf, o seu pai é proprietário da Jet Resgate Portugal e sempre fez surf. Foi ele que desenhou as pranchas que o seu filho utiliza e conduz a moto de água para colocar nas ondas, o que acontece a seguir é da sua inteira responsabilidade. A mãe fica em terra a ver o marido e o filho a desafiar as monstruosas ondas.\nDomador de ondas gigantes\nO gosto pelo surf normal começou aos quatro anos por influência do pai, que “ficava na praia à espera que terminasse as aulas para depois ir surfar com ele”, mas tudo mudou aos 12 começou quando surfou pela primeira vez as ondas gigantes e percebeu que o seu futuro estava em enfrentar ondas indomáveis. “O meu pai estava a fazer segurança numa competição em Peniche e era suposto eu ficar com a prancha dele no canal à espera que terminasse o resgate para depois irmos surfar. Comecei a ver os outros e pensei que se eles conseguem eu também conseguia e fui para o pico apanhar ondas. Tentei apanhar uma onda, mas caí e levei com duas ondas em cima. O meu pai ficou assustado, foi-me buscar e perguntou se estava bem, eu disse-lhe que sim e que queria continuar. Não consegui fazer nenhuma onda, mas a sensação de adrenalina foi tão grande e viciante que nunca mais deixei de fazer ondas grandes”, disse o big rider português, que consegue coisas que, aparentemente, são impossíveis de fazer. “Surfar ondas grandes é uma sensação única. É medo, felicidade, adrenalina, amor, são todos esses sentimentos misturados”.\nHá duas formas de chegar às assustadoras ondas, como nos explicou António Laureano “através do tow-in, isto é, quando a moto nos ajuda a entrar na onda, e pela remada, neste caso vou a remar sozinho até ao topo da onda”, e diz quem sabe que a adrenalina é o perigo são superiores ao verificado no tow-in. De notar que nas competições, existe a obrigatoriedade de o piloto ter de surfar e de o surfista saber pilotar a moto.\nO momento alto é quando desafia a natureza e desce uma impressionante massa de água: “É uma sensação tão curta e intensa que é difícil de explicar. O coração está a mil e só penso em aproveitar a onda e controlar a prancha para não cair. Há um pouco de pensamento estratégico na descida para que tudo corra bem”. Não é só a dinâmica do surfista e o monstruoso muro de água que impressionam, a velocidade também. “Já desci a 78,8 km/h, mas há outros que atingiram velocidades superiores, a sensação de velocidade é tão grande que os olhos ficam a lacrimejar”, acrescentou. O jovem prodígio disse-nos que surfar as ondas gigantes “requer uma técnica muito apurada, mas tudo depende da onda. Quando é mesmo gigante, tentamos ir o mais rápido possível e sobreviver”, e adiantou ainda que “hoje em dia há surfistas a tentar integrar o surf normal nas ondas grandes e a fazer as mesmas manobras, isso faz com que o surf esteja a evoluir”.\nO equipamento para enfrentar o medonho mar da Nazaré nos dias mais extremos difere do material usado no surf normal. “Utilizo pranchas de nove e 11 quilos com uma construção diferente. É colocado chumbo no interior para ficarem mais pesadas e evitar que saltem muito, pois velocidade é grande”, explica. Igualmente importante são as técnicas de resgate feitas por surfistas experientes e com potentes motos de água (300 cv), que rasgam literalmente as ondas. “O resgate é muito importante no nosso desporto porque estamos a falar de ondas gigantes e é a nossa vida que está em risco. Temos de ter confiança nas pessoas que estão a ajudar-nos, pois há técnicas específicas de resgate”, fez questão de referir.\nMuitas das pessoas que assistem à Big Waves Challenge têm os olhos nos surfistas, mas à sua volta há uma logística muito grande, como nos disse o jovem surfista. “A segurança é algo que se trabalha constantemente. Temos sempre duas motos dentro de água, uma que puxa o surfista, a outra que faz a segurança à primeira moto e que vai assumir o resgate se alguma coisa falhar. Além disso, está sempre uma pessoa no farol a dar indicações via rádio”.\nAlém do protocolo de segurança, o equipamento destes super-heróis é específico. “O fato de surf é normal, mas o que uso por baixo é um fato de impacto com zonas de flutuação nos sítios onde é mais provável aleijarmo-nos. Uso também um colete insuflável com pequenas botijas de CO2, que é usado quando estou em apuros e quero vir à superfície. Posso usá-lo quatro vezes numa sessão, se isso acontecer digo para mim mesmo que o melhor é sair da água”, frisou.\nA persistência é muito comum aos surfistas de ondas grandes e o risco também. António Laureano recordou um dos momentos mais aflitivos que passou no mar. “O ano passado tive uma situação de aperto que nunca mais vou esquecer. Foi das maiores sessões que fiz até hoje na Nazaré, entrei tarde numa onda, acabei por cair, fiquei imenso tempo debaixo de água, levei com várias ondas na cabeça e o colete insuflável rebentou com a pressão debaixo de água. Quando aquilo acabou e cheguei à praia estava um pouco atordoado devido à falta de oxigénio. Só na primeira onda estive debaixo de água 30 segundos, parecia que estava dentro de uma máquina de lavar. Na altura fiquei assustado, mas no final do dia voltei para a água e ainda fiz umas ondas”, relembrou.\nA parte física e mental são fundamentais para praticar este desporto. António Laureano é acompanhado por um treinador, por uma psicóloga de desporto e por um nutricionista. “Sendo um desporto bastante exigente, a preparação física é muito importante, tal como os treinos de apneia na piscina. Mas ainda mais importante é a parte mental, a nossa cabeça tem de estar bem. Podemos ter uma extraordinária preparação física, mas se não conseguirmos controlar o stress e a ansiedade entramos em pânico e vai tudo por água abaixo”, salientou.\nHá sempre medo\nEnfrentar as Big Waves é um desafio que impõe respeito como nos confidenciou: “Há sempre medo. Se algum surfista vai para estas ondas sem ter medo é porque não está bem da cabeça. Estamos a enfrentar a natureza, com uma energia brutal, que não conseguimos controlar. Quando estamos na onda acontece aquilo que tiver de acontecer, eu só penso em divertir-me, embora tenha a noção que é um desporto de alto risco”.\nAntónio Laureano tem uma abordagem muito própria sobre o perigo que é surfar ondas de grande dimensão. “A minha mentalidade é que acontece o que tiver de acontecer. Não adianta estar preocupado, se penso muito nisso acabo por perder o amor ao que gosto de fazer”.\nComo acontece com muitos outros desportistas, António Laureano tem o seu ritual antes de enfrentar as ondas gigantes, “no caminho vou sempre a rezar. Tanto o meu pai como os meus amigos respeitam esse momento e não falam comigo”.\nA espera por uma boa onda pode ser longa, e nem sempre sai a onda desejada. “Quando apanho uma onda não tenho noção do tipo de onda que é, sei apenas que é enorme. Consigo ter uma ideia do seu tamanho pelo tempo que levo a descer, pela sombra da onda e pelo barulho ao rebentar”, explicou.\nBem conhecedor do mar da Nazaré, não tem dúvidas em afirmar que: “São as melhores do mundo. Já tive momentos incríveis. Muita gente diz que a melhor onda do mundo é a mais perfeita de sempre, para mim não tem só a ver com perfeição, é também aquela que me proporcionou os melhores momentos da minha vida”. A primeira surfada na Nazaré ficou registada para sempre pela experiência e porque dentro de água estavam surfistas como o Garrett McNamara.\nFoi precisamente na Praia do Norte que, em 2020, surfou uma onda com 30,9 metros de altura, segundo a medição do professor Miguel Moreira, da Faculdade de Motricidade Humana, que também mediu a onda que deu o recorde mundial à brasileira Maya Gabeira. A mediação é feita através de um programa informático onde é marcado o ponto mais alto (crista) e o mais baixo (base) da onda e avaliado o seu tamanho tendo como referencial de escala a altura do surfista. “Pedimos a certificação, mas não obtivemos resposta da World Surf League nem do Guinness Book e deixei de pensar no recorde”. Apesar de a marca não ter sido oficializada, lembra-se bem do momento: “Foi uma onda rápida e envolvente, acabei a chorar e com o público a aplaudir, percebi logo que tinha sido uma grande onda. Quando vi as imagens confirmei que foi a maior onda que surfei”.\nO modo de surfar este tipo de onda tem vindo a mudar como explicou. “Houve uma enorme evolução na forma de surfar ondas grandes. Há uns anos, a técnica era ir a direito e sobreviver, às vezes tentava-se o tubo. Hoje em dia, há gente a desafiar os limites em mares cada vez maiores e a surfar nas ondas gigantes como se fosse em mar pequeno e a tentar realizar várias manobras”.\nEste ano espera experimentar novos spots fora do país. “Nos outros anos não tinha capacidade financeira para viajar para o Havai ou Califórnia, onde também há ondas grandes. Este ano estou a pensar fazer uma dessas viagens, aguardo as condições ideais”.\nDesafiar as ondas gigantes é o que mais gosta de fazer e é um objetivo de carreira como nos disse “é um estilo de vida e vai ser uma carreira”. “Estou tão viciado na sensação de adrenalina que vai ser para o resto da vida. Gosto muito de surfar mar pequeno durante o verão, mas uso isso para lazer. A minha paixão são as ondas grandes, sempre que acabo uma onda fico com certeza de que é isto que eu quero fazer”, acrescentou.\nO objetivo para esta temporada é entrar no campeonato de ondas grandes no town-in onde estão garantidos três portugueses. “Há muito que quero representar Portugal neste campeonato, e estou à espera da confirmação da organização. Foi na Nazaré que ganhei o amor por aquilo que faço, e é na onda portuguesa que quero conseguir um grande resultado”, disse-nos António Laureano, que aguarda ansiosamente a saída da lista definitiva e o alerta verde para avançar.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Whitley County, Kentucky from 1901-2000 was 37.2. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Whitley County, Kentucky experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Whitley County, Kentucky history.",

    "text": "Et de deux pour Starlink ! Après United Airlines, le fournisseur d'accès à Internet par satellite de la société SpaceX (Elon Musk) a conclu un accord avec la compagnie française Air France pour fournir du Wi-Fi, explique 01Net. Concrètement, tous les passagers volant à bord d’un appareil d’Air France pourront se connecter gratuitement à Internet grâce à ce service qui intéresse de plus en plus de compagnies aériennes. Pour cela, il faudra attendre l’été 2025 puisque le service sera proposé «progressivement», commente Air France.S’il est encore rare de bénéficier du Wi-Fi gratuit à bord d’un avion, Air France fait ce pari, mais à une condition : les utilisateurs devront se connecter à leur compte Flying Blue. Cela signifie donc qu’il faut être membre du programme de fidélité ou alors avoir créé son compte avant son voyage. Selon Air France, tous ses avions (200) seront concernés, y compris les vols régionaux. L’offre qui était proposée jusqu’alors sera remplacée. À lire aussi : Internet par satellites : l’Europe a la technologie pour concurrencer Elon Musk 6 700 satellites sur le réseau StarlinkCréer un compte Flying Blue est très facile en soi. Il permet de cumuler des Miles et XP, et de profiter de nombreux avantages chez Air France et ses partenaires. Les statuts évoluent selon les points cumulés lors de vos voyages, d’Explorer à Ultimate en passant par Silver, Gold ou Platinium. Comme le rappelle 01Net, Air France proposait du Wi-Fi gratuit à bord, mais seulement pour envoyer ou recevoir des messages. Les passagers souhaitant accéder à des services de streaming devaient souscrire à une offre allant de 3 à 18 euros.De son côté, Starlink promet un débit plutôt rapide, compris entre l’ADSL et la fibre. Son réseau est composé de plus de 6 700 satellites. Depuis plusieurs années, la société appartenant à SpaceX promet d’éradiquer les zones blanches. En février dernier, la compagnie promettait qu’un simple téléphone pourrait se connecter à Starlink grâce à son service appelé «Direct to Cell» ou «Direct to Phone». Début janvier, SpaceX avait déployé ses six premiers satellites dédiés au service…",
