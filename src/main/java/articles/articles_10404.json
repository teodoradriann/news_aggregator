    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

Ele deu a declaração em Goiana (PE), em inauguração de fábrica da Hemobrás. “Queremos um país soberano, capaz de ter uma indústria da saúde, porque nós temos o órgão consumidor que é o SUS . Que pode comprar as máquinas que a gente produzir, os remédios que a gente produzir, as vacinas. A gente não tem por que não acreditar que a gente pode ter um polo industrial na área da saúde para competir com qualquer outro país do mundo”, declarou o presidente da República.\nTecnologia Além disso, Lula voltou a falar sobre inteligência artificial . Disse, dirigindo-se à ministra da Ciência e Tecnologia, Luciana Santos, que quer ver um projeto brasileiro para o setor até junho.

    "title": "D.C., Washington Commanders close to a stadium deal at RFK site - The Washington Post",
    "text": "D.C. and the Washington Commanders are close to a deal to build the team’s new home at the RFK Stadium site, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive discussions. The deal is not yet official, those people said, and the contributions from each party are not finalized.\nThe potential agreement comes after months of talks between the administration of D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and the team, a process that gained significant momentum after D.C. gained control of the 174-acre waterfront RFK campus through an act of Congress in December. The move made possible a longtime dream of the mayor’s to redevelop the site — and potentially bring the football team back to where it played from 1961 until 1996. The news of an impending deal was first reported by Mark Segraves of NBC4.\nThe Commanders, who now play in Landover, Maryland, are expected to tap into the NFL’s stadium-loan program to finance a portion of their contribution, according to a person familiar with the situation. The NFL declined to comment. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been actively involved in the talks, another person said.\nA spokesperson for Bowser declined to comment on the status of the administration’s discussions with the team.\nSkip to end of carousel\nthe Post Local newsletterto get local news, weather and expert advice — where to eat, where to drink and how to get around — every weekday.\nThe deal could appear in Bowser’s budget proposal for next fiscal year. Bowser is expected to unveil that proposal sometime in the next month, city officials said this week. She said Monday that her 2026 budget is “done” — but her administration has been waiting to release it because they will submit it to the D.C. Council along with a revised budget for this year that has been thrown into uncertainty by a $1 billion cut imposed by Congress.\nThe Congress-induced budget crisis has left D.C. officials with a $410 million shortfall to close between now and the end of the fiscal year in September, one that they are still hoping the House of Representatives will reverse when they return from recess at the end of the month. Still, Bowser announced this week that she must take immediate and “extraordinary measures” to cut costs in the meantime. Bowser on Tuesday issued an order freezing government hiring and directing her administration to come up with plans for potential furloughs of city employees and closures of government facilities.\nThe capital budget, which would be the source of city funds for the stadium, is separate from the operating budget that funds D.C. government agencies and services.\nBowser has said she envisions a stadium as one part of a multiuse development that would include housing, retail, a sportsplex for D.C. residents and green space.\nAny stadium deal involving public funds will have to get approval from the D.C. Council — where not every lawmaker supports financing a stadium with taxpayer money. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has said he does not oppose a stadium itself but does not want public dollars paying for any part of it.\nMendelson (D) said this week that the council has “not been consulted or kept informed” about the negotiations with the Commanders. “I find it disturbing that the mayor believes a unilateral approach is the best course, especially when ultimately the council has to give approval,” he said.\nA group of activists has also launched a ballot initiative effort to block construction of a stadium at RFK, arguing the land would be best used for affordable housing instead of a stadium. Their initiative seeks to get a question on the ballot in next year’s local elections, allowing D.C. voters to decide whether they want to change zoning rules to prohibit any professional sports stadium from being built on the RFK campus.\nThis story is developing and will be updated.",
