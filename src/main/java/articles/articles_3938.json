    "text": "Hundreds Rescued From Chairlifts in Alps on Christmas Eve Ian Greenwood Thu, December 26, 2024 at 8:21 PM UTC 2 min read\nFor several hundred skiers in the French Alps, a Christmas Eve trip to the mountains might have involved more waiting than skiing—at two separate resorts, guests were stranded on chairlifts.\nLe Dauphiné reports that , just before 1 p.m., the La Festoure chairlift at Superdévoluy ski area became inoperable and some 240 skiers were rescued with ropes and helicopter assistance. The rescue operation finished hours later, around 4:45 p.m. No injuries have been reported.\nThe rescue required significant manpower and resources, involving the Air Section of the gendarmerie, high mountain gendarmerie platoon, and firefighters, among others, Le Dauphiné reports . The gendarmerie is a branch of the French military.\nAt La Norma Resort in Savoie, around 100 skiers were also trapped on a chairlift Tuesday, according to TF1 . Their rescue was helicopter-assisted.\nRelated: Washington Ski Area To Welcome \"Game-Changing\" New Chairlift\nDecember’s proven bumpy for chairlift operations at ski resorts.\nAt Snowbowl, Montana, an empty chair decoupled from the LaVelle lift’s cable and fell to the snow after striking a lift operator on December 16th. The ski area reported no injuries and, in a statement , called the incident “highly unusual and isolated.” LaVelle was inspected and resumed operation later that day, according to the statement.\nIn Colorado, 174 people were rescued from a gondola at Winter Park Resort, Colorado. Just after noon Saturday, the gondola automatically stopped after encountering a structural crack. The trapped skiers and snowboarders were lowered by rope over around five hours, according to CNN . The gondola has since reopened after undergoing testing and inspection .\nEarlier this month, a snowboarder was taken to the hospital after they fell off the Ruby Express chairlift at Keystone Resort, Colorado.\nCalifornia has had its own ski lift troubles.\nFive people were injured at Heavenly Mountain in the Lake Tahoe during a lift malfunction Monday. Some people were thrown into the snow 30 feet below, according to NBC Bay Area . The injured visitors were taken to a hospital in Reno, Nevada.\nAccording to an annual safety report from the National Ski Areas Association (NSAA), fatal lift malfunctions remain uncommon. Between 1973 and January 31st, 2024, nine lift malfunctions have caused 16 fatalities—the majority of these incidents occurred in the 1970s and 1980s.\nRelated: Stratton To Give Free Lift Tickets to Non-Profit Vermont Ski Hill\nBe the first to read breaking ski news with POWDER.
