    "title": "Milwaukee Jihad: A Tense Political Thriller Blending Espionage, Science, and Action",
    "text": "EINPresswire.com/ -- In his latest novel, \" Milwaukee Jihad,\" the acclaimed author Mathew Flynn, captivates audiences with a thrilling narrative that combines high-stakes espionage, cutting-edge science, and raw action. Set against a backdrop of global terrorism and covert government operations, this novel is a gripping exploration of modern warfare and the relentless fight to safeguard democracy.\nThe story unfolds as jihadist forces, including ISIS and their collaborators, plot a devastating attack on the U.S. Capitol during the State of the Union speech. Their plan: to annihilate the Capitol and its inhabitants using a lethal combination of suicide bombers and a fleet of small suicide planes. The terrorists, who have already embedded assassins in key U.S. cities, use a system of quantum cryptography for communication, a code the U.S. struggles to decipher.\nEnter Bernie Weber, a brilliant doctoral student, who is enlisted to break this uncrackable code. CIA agent Audrey Knapp is tasked with ensuring Weber's safety as the plot thickens. The narrative builds to a crescendo as the assassins are systematically eliminated in a gritty counter-offensive led by Knapp and the resilient forces of Milwaukee.\nAs the President and the First Lady commence their limousine ride to the Capitol, a dramatic showdown ensues. Navy Seals, Navy planes, and Audrey Knapp, armed only with her wits and a knife in the Visitor Gallery, race against time to thwart the final attack. This electrifying clash of cultures and ideologies is interwoven with dark humor, high-octane action, and a deep dive into the worlds of politics and mathematical science.\n\"Milwaukee Jihad\" stands as a testament to the author's masterful storytelling abilities, weaving together elements of violence, political intrigue, and science in a narrative that feels both timely and timeless.\nThis novel follows the author's previous works, \"China Code,\" a darkly comic thriller about a math genius, and \"Confessions of a Church Lawyer,\" a revealing journey into the moral complexities at the crossroads of faith and legality. Together, these books form a compelling trilogy that challenges and entertains, inviting readers into worlds where the stakes couldn't be higher.\n\"Milwaukee Jihad\"is available now in bookstores and online, offering readers a thrilling, thought-provoking journey through the shadowy realms of global politics and covert operations.\nMatthew Flynn\nMilwaukee Jihad\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",

    "text": "DELTA — A truck carrying what appears to be heavy construction material has smashed into an overpass in Delta, British Columbia, shutting down the southbound lanes of Highway 99.\nIt's the latest in a rash of overpass collisions that prompted the province to announce harsher penalties for companies and drivers with repeat offences earlier this month.\nDrive BC says the incident south of Vancouver has also blocked traffic in both directions on the 112th Street overpass.\nDelta Fire and Rescue Deputy Chief Dave Wood says the crash caused a \"secondary accident\" involving another vehicle.\nHe says crews were called to the scene at 12:14 p.m. and he didn't know of any injuries.\nPhotos of the aftermath of the incident posted on social media show large girders on the bed of a truck with another laying across the highway along with other debris.\nProvincial statistics say as many as 30 bridge strikes have happened on British Columbia's highways since 2021, with 16 of them reported last year alone.\nThe new rules, announced Dec. 14, include the requirement for dump-style vehicles to have in-cab warning devices by next June, telling drivers if their trailer hasn't been lowered.\nOver-height vehicle fines will increase to $575, up from $115.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",
