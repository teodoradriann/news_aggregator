    "text": "The International Space Station (ISS) has recently captured stunning images of Kansas from space. The photos, taken by high-resolution cameras aboard the ISS, offer a unique perspective of the state’s diverse landscapes and geographic features. The images showcase Kansas’ sprawling farmlands, with vast swathes of green and brown fields that characterize the region’s agricultural wealth.\nThey also reveal intricate river systems and urban areas, providing a glimpse into both the natural and developed environments of the state. These photos are part of NASA’s ongoing mission to observe our planet from the unique vantage point of space. They contribute to our understanding of Earth’s processes and aid in the monitoring of environmental changes and natural disasters.\nThe Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit at NASA’s Johnson Space Center made these images available.\nStunning Kansas’ aerial landscapes They serve not only as a visual feast but also as valuable data for scientists and researchers studying Earth’s environmental patterns and changes.\nThe ISS orbits Earth 16 times every 24 hours, making periodic appearances over various parts of the world. Its predictable path allows enthusiasts and onlookers to plan their celestial observations. To help residents spot the ISS, NASA’s “Spot the Station” website provides details on when it will be visible in your area.\nThe ISS is visible to the naked eye during certain times at night and can appear like a fast-moving star zooming across the sky, distinct from planes due to its steady course and lack of flashing lights. These awe-inspiring photos of Kansas taken from space invite viewers to appreciate the beauty and complexity of our planet. They underscore the importance of space-based observation in advancing our knowledge of Earth.",

    "title": "Bobby Scott discusses impact of Affordable Care Act | 13newsnow.com",
    "text": "NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — It's been 14 years since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. At the time, 50 million Americans did not have health insurance. Now, 40 million are enrolled in the program that covers pre-existing conditions and cuts costs for patients. Congressman Bobby Scott (D, VA-03) gathered healthcare professionals together to discuss just how much the ACA changed the medical landscape since 2010. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health insurance and long-term care to low-income families, individuals 65 and older, and patients with disabilities. Chester Williams is happy to be alive today. In 2019, he said an SUV hit him and sent him to the hospital. \"I was in a hospital bed for six months and six operations,\" Williams said. He credits his Medicaid plan for bringing his hospital bill down from $138,000 to owing nothing. \"I’m just grateful to be here to let anyone know, the Affordable Care Act works because it worked for me and I have the receipts,\" Williams told Congressman Scott. Scott, a Democrat representing Virginia's Third District, touted the half a million Virginians now enrolled in Medicaid. He emphasized the fact that young people can stay on their family insurance plan until they turn 26 and 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions are protected. In 2018, Virginia authorized Medicaid expansion to cover low-income adults who are not parents. \"People tend to forget what life was like before the Affordable Care Act when costs were going through the roof, people were losing their insurance.\" Multiple people in the room emphasized how the ACA has allowed people who might’ve avoided getting preventative work done, to feel empowered to do so. They say it has also helped take some of the burden off emergency rooms. \"It’s allowed people to not necessarily have to use the emergency room, they can find a physician, they can come to a clinic, they can do these other things to get this care,\" said Iris Lundy, Vice President of Health Equity with Sentara Health. CEO of the Southeastern Virginia Health System Angela Futrell said the ACA saved the people who were falling through the cracks. \"Medicaid expansion has for our clients, those who live at 100% poverty or less, it has been lifesaving, life-changing,\" she said. The ACA is an issue Republicans have pushed back on for years, saying the federal government should not be so involved in the nation’s healthcare system. In their latest move, the House Republican Study Committee’s recent budget proposal takes aim at the law. A spokesperson for Republican Congresswoman Jen Kiggans says she is not a member of the RSC and \"did not not have any part in drafting that proposed budget, and as a healthcare provider does not support cuts to critical programs such as Medicare and Social Security. After the President’s State of the Union last year, Congresswoman Kiggans was interviewed by CSPAN, during which she reiterated her commitment to supporting Medicare in addition to addressing general, much-needed healthcare improvements.\" More than half a million Virginians are enrolled in Medicaid, while another half a million remain uninsured. Gaylene Kanoyton said she’s always pushed for Medicaid expansion in her role at Celebrate Healthcare. \"No one should be without insurance at all,\" Kanoyton said. \"The affordable care has saved so many lives.\"",

    "text": "Will the Trump administration choose confrontation with Pope Francis?\nPope Francis strongly opposed Donald Trump’s immigration policy in a letter to the American bishops. The reaction of a close associate of the American president, asking Francis to \"stay out of border issues,\" crystallizes a deep crisis, explains researcher Benoît Gautier.\nU.S. Vice President J. D. Vance was in Paris February 11 for the International Summit on AI, defending major American tech companies against the European Union’s regulatory ambitions. He was likely unaware that he was about to face another form of regulation—this time, a doctrinal one. Around 12:30 p.m., the Vatican released a letter addressed to the American bishops. There is no doubt that the very Catholic vice president was also among its recipients.\nVance, who converted to Catholicism five years ago, made headlines January 26 by defending Trump’s immigration policies in the face of protests from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He attacked the bishops head-on, suggesting that their criticisms were financially motivated. The Trump administration had just abruptly cut federal funding to the church, which contracts with Catholic associations to provide some migrant assistance services.\nPope Francis openly opposes Trump’s immigration policy\n\"As a devoted Catholic, I was heartbroken by their statements. I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?\" Vance insinuated. His statement drew the ire of the very conservative Cardinal Dolan of New York, who had offered a prayer on behalf of Catholics at President Trump’s inauguration.\nVance, the 'chief catechist' of Trumpists\nOn January 30, Vance defended his position by invoking the principle of Ordo amoris, a doctrine inspired by Saint Augustine, which he defined as prioritizing love for one’s socially closest neighbors before focusing on more distant ones:\n\"You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"\nPut in more prosaic terms, \"charity begins at home.\" The statement delighted Trump-supporting Catholics, with one publication even bestowing upon Vance the title of \"chief catechist.\"\nThe pope’s letter encouraged American bishops to stand firm alongside migrants in their confrontation with the Trump administration, even as some bishops, despite their reservations, had publicly aligned themselves with the doctrine espoused by the vice president. In fact, just minutes after the Vatican’s letter was published, the website Word on Fire, run by the highly influential Bishop Robert Barron, released a defense and illustration of Vance’s exegesis.\nThe article’s introduction directly contradicted the pope’s text word for word. Although this collision of publications is highly likely accidental—Word on Fire’s piece was probably prepared several days in advance—this coincidence is a brutally revealing sign of the Vatican's direct opposition to certain highly influential factions of the U.S. Church.\nChallenging the pope’s legitimacy\nThe tone of the pope’s message reveals a form of frustration with the vice president’s ambitions to position himself as an interpreter of Catholic doctrine. Without naming him, the text directly targets Vance, stating that his interpretation of Ordo amoris reflects a form of individualism that is incompatible with the anthropology upheld by the church:\n\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups (…). The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception,\" the pope wrote.\nVance was converted within the milieu of Catholic integralists, who advocate for the subordination of political power to spiritual authority. Will the vice president and the Catholic faction he represents accept this public admonition, or will they choose confrontation? The response from Tom Homan, a self-proclaimed Catholic and the official in charge of implementing Trump’s immigration policy, suggested that their strategy might be to challenge the pope’s legitimacy to speak on political matters.\nAs has happened before, the strategy draws an impermeable boundary between the pope’s legitimate domain—doctrine—and political affairs, urging the pontiff to stay in his lane. However, this approach may not suffice, given that Vance and his allies fundamentally reject the separation between doctrine and politics. Moreover, the vice president himself recklessly ventured into the Vatican’s domain by attempting to justify his policies through an interpretation of Catholic doctrine.",

    "text": "In Kelantan, Starbucks recently ceased the operation in its one last outlet.\nThe Starbucks in KB Mall, Kota Bharu, officially closed its doors yesterday (November 30). Due to the ongoing boycott movement, the number of closed Starbucks branches in Malaysia increased from 25 to 50 outlets , reported Sin Chew .\nAccording to the report, the outlet in KB Mall stopped selling coffee three days before its closure . The coffee beans were grounded, and the baristas could only sell non-coffee beverages to the patrons before the closure.\nAn emotional goodbye\nMany employees, especially those who had been stationed at the outlet for a long time, got emotional, and some decided to resign because they didn’t want to be transferred to other outlets.\nThe employees resigned for different reasons, but most couldn’t accept being transferred to other states.\nThe other 2 closed outlets were located near the commercial district. On its closure day, some customers came and sat down for some beverages to show their support one last time before Starbucks in KB Mall closed its doors forever.\nWhat do you think of the closure of ALL Starbucks outlets in KB Mall?\nAlso read: “I don’t know what’s this” – M’sians Share Their Funny Experience of Trying Starbucks For the 1st Time\nSource: Sin Chew Source: Sin Chew Source: Sin Chew",

    "title": "The high cost of eating well",
    "text": "AS the cost of living continues to rise in Malaysia, driven in part by the Sales and Service Tax (SST), more families will find it harder to put nutritious food on the table.\nWhile SST may not apply to all food products, its indirect effect through higher transport, service and business operation costs will push up prices of most food items, including fresh vegetables, fruits and basic groceries.\nNotably, tropical fruits like bananas, pineapples and rambutans will be taxed at 5%, along with imported fruits such as grapes, berries, avocados, lychees and starfruit. These are not luxury items; they are daily dietary staples for millions of urban Malaysians, providing essential nutrients like fibre, vitamin C, antioxidants and healthy fats.\nIn many cases, these imported fruits cannot be produced locally at a sufficient scale, making them irreplaceable within the current food system.\nWhat used to be an affordable balanced meal will now become a budgeting challenge. Families from all walks of life and across all income levels now have to prioritise affordability over nutrition.\nWhile economic policies aim to boost national revenue, their ripple effects will be deeply felt in household kitchens where meals will increasingly be shaped by price rather than nutritional value. This shift is understandable but will come at a cost to our health.\nMiddle-income families are also struggling to stretch their budgets, opting for quantity over quality to feed their households. This growing “health affordability gap” is dangerous. It can lead to a population that is fed but undernourished.\nThis issue ties closely to dietary inequality where socioeconomic status, lifestyle, geography and systemic access will determine not just how much food people can buy but the quality of that food.\nToday’s dietary patterns are increasingly unsafe, unstable and unequal, especially for a significant portion of the population. When good nutrition becomes inaccessible, the consequences will be felt across the entire nation.\nThis dietary shift will drive a surge in malnutrition and rising obesity rates, especially among urban low-income communities where access to fresh, healthy food is limited.\nPoor diets compromise immune function, leading to more sick days and reduced workplace productivity. This will place a heavier burden on the national healthcare system. For children, the effects can be more\nsevere – ranging from stunted growth, reduced cognitive performance to long-term health complications.\nIf this issue remains unaddressed, the gap between those who can afford to eat well and those who cannot will continue to widen, posing a serious threat not only to individual well-being but also to Malaysia’s social stability, economic resilience and long-term development.\nIf no measures are taken, the post-SST future may bring:\nIncreased demand for public healthcare due to a rise in diet-related illnesses;\nGreater strain on school feeding programmes as more children arrive undernourished; and\nWidening social gaps between families who can afford balanced meals and those who cannot.\nGood nutrition is a right and necessity\nThe government should zero-rate SST for essential nutritious items, including imported fruits. Fruits are a vital daily source of vitamin and fibre, and access to them should not be limited by income level.\nNutritional equity must go beyond borders – good health should not depend on whether a fruit is grown locally or imported.\nAdditionally, supermarkets and grocers should be encouraged to offer rotational weekly discounts on local and commonly imported fruits under\na “Healthy Fruit for All” initiative, making nutritious choices more accessible to everyone.\nMany urban families rely on promotions to guide their purchasing decisions. Clearly labelled discounts on local and essential food items can improve affordability and encourage healthier eating habits.\nGood nutrition is not a luxury; it is a fundamental right that must be protected through inclusive policies and practical, accessible solutions.\nThe SST rollout may be necessary for economic sustainability but nutrition must not become collateral damage. Without intervention, we risk reversing progress on Sustainable Development Goals related to health, hunger and inequality.\nEvery action we take now will determine whether Malaysia remains on track towards the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development or fall into a nutrition divide that will harm generations to come.\nLet us ensure that the right to eat well does not become a privilege. A healthy Malaysia begins with affordable nutrition for all.\nDr Salini Devi Rajendran is a senior lecturer at Taylor’s Culinary Institute, Faculty of Social Sciences and Leisure Management, Taylor’s University.\nComments: letters@thesundaily.com",

    "text": "Um jovem de 15 anos foi morto por um tubarão, num local para a prática de surf num Estado da Austrália do Sul, adiantou a polícia australiana.\nO ataque aconteceu perto de Ethel Beach, na Península de Yorke, na quinta-feira à tarde, referiu a polícia em comunicado.\n“Infelizmente, o corpo de um adolescente foi recuperado da água”, acrescentou, explicando ainda que a vítima era natural dos arredores a sul de Adelaide.\nSegundo um morador de Ethel Beach citado pelo diário The Advertiser de Adelaide, outro surfista tentou socorrer o adolescente que tinha sido mordido numa perna. “O tubarão estava a circular à volta deles, enquanto o rapaz tentava tirar o jovem da água. Havia muito sangue”, destacou.\nNão está claro que espécie de tubarão atacou, mas os grandes tubarões brancos são numerosos nas águas do sul da Austrália.\nEm outubro, testemunhas viram um tubarão levar um surfista de 55 anos nas mandíbulas em Granite Beach, também no sul da Austrália. O corpo nunca foi encontrado.\nEm maio, um surfista de 46 anos foi atacado por um tubarão em Walkers Rock Beach, no mesmo Estado. O seu corpo também nunca foi encontrado, e as equipes de salvamento encontraram apenas um fragmento do seu equipamento de surf.\nO número de mordidas de tubarão aumentou nas últimas quatro décadas devido, em parte, ao crescimento populacional e às alterações climáticas, segundo especialistas.\nO aquecimento dos oceanos está a levar os tubarões a aproximarem-se da costa à procura de presas, aumentando a probabilidade de entrarem em contacto com os humanos.\n ",
