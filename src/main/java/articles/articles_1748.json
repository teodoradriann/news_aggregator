    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday asked a judge to drop a gun charge against a man Attorney General Pam Bondi last month called a leader of the MS-13 gang in the U.S., a court filing showed.\nFederal authorities arrested Henry Josue Villatoro Santos, 24, last month in Virginia and charged him with illegal gun possession by an alien.\nIn court papers, federal prosecutors said law enforcement officials \"observed indicia of MS-13 association\" while searching Villatoro's bedroom, after raiding his home and arresting him on an administrative immigration warrant. They made no other references to MS-13 and his alleged leadership role.\nAt a press conference, Bondi described him as one of the top leaders of the MS-13 gang in the United States and said he would not be \"living in our country much longer.\"\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Scott Malone)\nShare © Reuters - 2025",

    "title": "Killing of Hostages by Israeli Forces in Gaza Was Preventable, Military Probe Finds",
    "text": "The shooting deaths of three Israeli hostages by Israeli forces in Gaza this month could have been prevented, according to the findings of an Israeli military investigation that provides new details about the incident.\n“The entire chain of command feels responsible for this difficult event, regrets this outcome, and shares in the grief of the families of the three hostages,” Israeli military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said Thursday in a statement announcing the results of the investigation.\nThe three men were shot after they emerged from a building in Gaza City, shirtless and waving a white flag, on Dec. 15, according to the Israeli military.\nThe killings amplified pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with hostages’ families saying he hasn’t done enough to secure the release of captives abducted by Hamas and other attackers on Oct. 7. Israelis remain broadly supportive of the war but polls have indicated that a majority of the public have lost faith in Netanyahu.\nThe findings of the investigation were transmitted to Israel soldiers in the field to better prepare them for possible future encounters with hostages, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Thursday.\n“There are still 129 hostages in the Gaza area, in various places, and we may encounter them, and every soldier in the Gaza area received the lessons from this investigation,” he said.\nHamas and other militants took around 240 people hostage during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. More than 100 were freed in November following a cease-fire agreement with Hamas in which Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners.\nThe Israeli military’s report on its investigation describes events surrounding the shooting of the three hostages, Yotam Haim, 28 years old, Samer Talalka, 25, and Alon Shamriz, 26.\nAccording to a report on the investigation, after identifying the three men as threats, Israeli forces shot and killed two of them. A battalion commander on the scene ordered the soldiers to hold their fire while they identified the third.\nAfter 15 minutes the commander heard calls of “help” and “they are shooting at me.” The commander ordered the soldiers to hold fire while calling to the hostage, “come toward us.”\n“The figure emerged from a building toward the forces. Two soldiers, who did not hear the order due to noise from a nearby tank, shot at and killed the third hostage,” said a statement on the investigation.\nThe investigation found that there were other signs that there may have been hostages in the area days before the incident, Israeli forces found a note in Hebrew reading “help” at the exit of a tunnel in the area, the investigation found. A day before the killing, an Israeli drone also observed signs nearby with the writing “SOS” and “Help, 3 hostages.”\nIsraeli forces on the ground regarded the note and the sign as an attempt by Hamas to lure them into an ambush, the investigation found. They identified blue barrels in the drone footage as a sign that the area could be rigged with explosives, the investigation found.\nWhen Israeli forces heard calls of “help” and “hostages” from within the building, they interpreted it as “a terrorist deception attempt,” the investigation found.\nThough the incident could have been prevented, said Halevi, the chief of staff, “there was no malice in the event, and the soldiers carried out the right action to the best of their understanding of the event at that moment.”\nHagari, the military spokesman, praised the “courage, persistence and bravery” of the three hostages. “In a war zone full of dangers, they acted while trying to do everything in their power to signal to us that they were in the area.”\nFamilies of remaining hostages and those freed from Gaza have said that the Israeli military campaign heightens the risks to the safety of the hostages. Netanyahu says that sustained military pressure is necessary to get Hamas to release hostages, though the group has said it won’t negotiate until Israel first implements a cease-fire.\nNetanyahu said in a meeting with representatives of families on Thursday that Israel was “holding contacts at this very moment” to free more hostages, according to a statement about the meeting. “We will not give up on anyone,” he said.\nJudi Weinstein, a 70-year-old U.S. citizen, was declared dead on Thursday, according to Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel. Weinstein was killed with her husband Gad Haggai, also a U.S. citizen, on the day of the attack and their bodies were taken and are still held by Hamas, a kibbutz spokesman said.\nPresident Biden expressed his condolences to the couple’s family on Thursday, as he had last week after Haggai’s death was confirmed. “Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judy Weinstein is also believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7,” Biden said in a statement, adding that he would continue to work to bring all the hostages home. The U.S. has designated Hamas as a terrorist organization.\nEgypt, Qatar and the U.S. have continued efforts to broker another deal to release more hostages.\nMore than 21,000 people have been killed in the Gaza, most of them women and children, since the war began, according to health authorities in the enclave, whose figures don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.\nSeparately, Iranian-backed militants and Israeli forces traded fire across Israel’s northern border while Israeli leaders warned that time was running out for diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions in that area, heightening fears that the war in Gaza could spill into a regional conflict including Lebanon and Syria.\n“The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out,” said Benny Gantz, a senior member of the Israeli war cabinet, on Wednesday. “If the world and the Lebanese government don’t act in order to prevent the firing on Israel’s northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the Israeli military will do it.”\nThe Israeli military reported “a large number of launches” toward Israel from southern Lebanon, and said it responded on Thursday with aircraft, tanks and artillery, including an airstrike on Hezbollah military compound.\nIsrael on Thursday intercepted a drone from Lebanon in the Krayot area of northern Israel, the military said, while an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia claimed responsibility for a drone carrying explosives that crash-landed into part of the Golan Heights annexed by Israel.\nThe rise in violence comes after an airstrike in Syria on Monday killed a senior official in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which oversees a network of paramilitary groups throughout the Middle East. Israel is believed to have launched the attack but hasn’t claimed responsibility.\nAt a funeral prayer service attended by thousands in Tehran on Thursday, Iranian leaders vowed to avenge the killing of the official, Sayyed Razi Mousavi.\nAcross the region, an array of Iranian-allied militia groups have sided with Hamas in the conflict, including Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have launched attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, disrupting a vital global shipping route.\nWrite to Jared Malsin at [email protected]",

    "text": "[Belgrano ](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/deportes/futbol/belgrano-pago-carisimo-sus-errores-y-perdio-2-3-ante-lanus-por-la-liga-profesional/)venía del triunfo sobre Riestra y quería seguir trepando en la Liga Profesional, pero... cayó [2-3 en su visita](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/deportes/futbol/tras-la-derrota-con-lanus-como-quedo-belgrano-en-la-tabla-y-cuando-recibe-a-godoy-cruz/) a Lanús por la fecha 7 de la Liga Profesional. ¿Por qué pasó lo que pasó? Estas son las claves de la caída de los dirigidos por Juan Cruz Real ante los de Ricardo Zielinski: Acierto y error. La inclusión de Nicolás “Uvita” Fernández desde el inicio le dio a Belgrano un mejor manejo de la pelota en cada ataque y le aportó un socio a Franco Jara en la ofensiva. Pero al mismo tiempo, el técnico Juan Cruz Real decidió que no jugara Velázquez y que fuese Reyna el que hiciera la banda. Esta función perjudicó el ataque por la izquierda, el trabajo del peruano y las chances del equipo por ese sector. Equivocarse y pagar. Después de un primer tiempo en el que hizo un buen partido, el Pirata pagó carísimo sus errores en defensa. Primero fue Troilo a los 10 del ST, cuando despejó mal una pelota alta y la dejó para que Moreno rematara desde el borde del área, tapó Chicco y en el rebote Sanabria puso el 2 a1. Equivocarse y pagar II. A pesar que no había tenido chances claras de llegar al empate, el visitante buscó romper la línea de cinco que armó Lanús con los ingresos de Suárez y Chavarría, sacó a “Uvita” que estaba agotado y fue al frente, pero Agustín Baldi jugó mal una pelota para atrás, Troilo no la pudo controlar y Torres puso el 3 a 1. Después el descuento de Jara fue anecdótico. VAR protagonista. La jugada del primer gol de Lanús dejó muchas dudas sobre la posición adelantada de Sanabria que finalmente no fue sancionada. Después, quedó flotando una supuesta falta sobre Jara en el ST. Mucha jugada de interpretación.",

    "title": "Relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane ‘honoured’ by OBEs | East Anglian Daily Times",
    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. The newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder. Kempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year. Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”. They described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”. Ms O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to. “She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.” Love Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls. Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive. “If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that. “We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area. “This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter. “So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace. “We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.” The handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said. She added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag. “Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace. “We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.” The next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide. Ms O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it. “Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.” Since Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women. The body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland. In February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far. He was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane. The rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane. The sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.",

    "text": "Las intensas lluvias dejan cerca de 200 incidencias en la provincia de Huelva\nAnegaciones, derrumbe de muros y rescates durante la jornada del viernes debido al temporal\nVeinte menores atrapados en una casa de campo durante la madrugada por las intensas lluvias en Punta Umbría\nHuelva/El fuerte temporal que se vivió este viernes en Huelva ha dejado una larga lista de incidencias a lo largo de toda la provincia que comenzaron a sucederse desde primera hora de la madrugada. A las 4:20 de la madrugada desde el Ayuntamiento de Huelva se activó el Plan de Emergencias Municipal nivel 1.\nLos Servicios de Emergencia, Policía Local, Protección Civil y bomberos trabajaron en el territorio para acudir a las 117 incidencias que se vivieron en diferentes municipios del territorio. Las anegaciones de calles, sótanos, viviendas de planta baja y establecimientos son los casos más atendidos por el Centro de Coordinación de Emergencias (Cecem 112).\nEn la capital de provincia se contabilizaron en total 20 intervenciones que fueron en su mayoría incidencias en algunos garajes donde entró agua especialmente en las zonas más bajas de la ciudad. A pesar de la intensidad de las lluvias sobre la capital, no hubo que lamentar daños personales ni materiales destacables en el mobiliario de la ciudad. Desde el Ayuntamiento aseguraron que los trabajos preventivos para afrontar las intensas lluvias funcionaron bien.\nLa alcaldesa de Huelva, Pilar Miranda, recorrió la ciudad desde primera hora del viernes para inspeccionar los efectos en todas las barriadas junto a Miguel Ángel Gómez, jefe de Protección Civil y la concejala de Seguridad Ciudadana y Movilidad, Milagros Rodríguez. De forma preventiva se decidió cortar el tráfico la calle Manuel de Falla junto al recinto Colombino.\nEn otros municipios de la provincia como Cartaya, Aljaraque y Punta Umbría, Ayamonte, El Cerro del Andévalo, Isla Cristina, La Nava, Lepe, Lucena Del Puerto o Palos De La Frontera, entre otros, también se registraron incidencias destacables como destrozos en viviendas y mobiliario urbano, inundaciones y rescates a los que asistieron el Consorcio Provincial de Bomberos de Huelva.\nEl intenso temporal provocó que algunos ciudadanos quedasen atrapados y tuviesen que ser rescatados. Este fue el caso de una vecina de Aljaraque que en plena madrugada se refugió en el tejado de su vivienda tras verse atrapada por el elevado nivel del agua. El rescate se llevó a cabo alrededor de las 5:00 de este viernes. En este mismo municipio se registraron además múltiples daños en sus carreteras debido al hundimiento de parte de algunas vías e inundaciones de algunos tramos de la calzada que imposibilitaron el paso de los vehículos y que necesitó que se achicase el agua.\nOtro de los lugares afectados por el paso de la DANA este viernes fue El Rincón, en Punta Umbría, donde las fuertes rachas de viento y las intensas lluvias provocaron el derrumbe de varios muros de patios de viviendas. También causaron la caída de varios árboles y la inundación de algunas calles por las que se dificultó la circulación de los coches. En Cartaya también se registraron daños en las carreteras por el hundimiento carreteras e inundaciones en algunos tramos de la calzada.\nEl Consorcio Provincial de Bomberos de Huelva también actuó en Calañas para retirar piedras y lodo que había quedado en las carreteras. Maniobras parecidas realizaron en La Nava tras el desprendimiento parcial de una ladera. En Punta Umbría y en Isla Cristina, los efectivos tuvieron que intervenir igualmente por inundaciones y realizar inspecciones en locales y garajes.\nTambién te puede interesar\nLo último",

    "text": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nY me preguntaba, cuando era pequeño, el sentido de la vida. Desde mi mente no vivida, desde un sentimiento intenso de hastío, al ver el comportamiento de los adultos, que no me gustaba en general, y por ello de ello infería el resto del mundo, yo no quería vivir. Eso es lo cierto. Ni quería, por esto mismo, claro, hacerme adulto. Si ya ser pequeño me dolía (alma y huesos), imaginaba de mayor y pensaba ¡qué horror!\nMe recuerdo escribiendo en mi juventud de las más variadas formas, en una charla de alguien, yo anotando en un trozo de hojita versos que me venían de golpe, sentado en una mesa de bar ante una libreta escribiendo con un bolígrafo en ella frenéticamente mientras los lerdos que pasaban me miraban, miraban a ver qué hacía. ¿Es que es tan anómalo ver en España a alguien escribiendo?\nMe recuerdo en distintas casas, muchas, ante una máquina de escribir eléctrica, recién salidas al mercado. Yo no quería, pensaba me jodería la inspiración, el decurso de esta. Me acostumbré, lo mismo que a los pc. Pero sigo escribiendo en hojitas, con boli o lápiz. Siempre intento llevar un bolígrafo encima. Afortunadamente -qué desgracia que existan, para la tierra-, como ahora todos llevamos móvil, este aparatejo tiene opciones para anotar cosas, como el álbum de notas, o grabar directamente un audio con lo que te viene a la cabeza, y en casa escucharlo y transcribirlo.\nCuando escribí hace pocos años el poema \"Yo creo que eres poema\", donde hablo desde la distancia de la escritura a un hombre sentado solo en un banco de parque solitario, que mira una hojita roja del otoño que sujeta en las manos, un hombre anciano, de los que esta sociedad deforme llama vagabundos, pero que deberían llamarse socialheridos; cuando escribí este poema reflejé lo que pienso sobre la poesía, sobre la vida; al fin, lo mismo. Vida y poesía lo mismo.\nNunca he dejado de estar encima del arte, rodeado de lo bello. Aunque hasta una cierta edad no lo apreciase ni comprendiese. He vivido en los mejores cuadros dramáticos, yo como uno de los elementos pintados. Hace poco me dijeron que mi padre había muerto, pero no sólo eso, que murió en febrero. En febrero de este año, 2023. No sentí nada. Bueno, algo desagradable sí. Porque fue un demonio, maltrató a mi madre y hermanas y hermanos durante años, desde que tengo uso de razón todo lo que recuerdo es miedo, por culpa de él.\nHace poco vi la película de Denzel Washington, \"Fences\", dirigida por él mismo y donde es protagonista. Fences está basada en la novela homónima de August Wilson, quien también escribió, según parece, el guion de la película. La única premisa obligatoria que dejó dicho para quien hiciera su texto en película era que el director fuera negro. Para cuando Denzel convirtió en poema la película, dirigiéndola prodigiosamente, August ya no estaba entre nosotros. Asumo que se sentiría orgulloso si pudiera ver tamaña obra de arte que Denzel lleva a los extremos más álgidos del arte del cine: genera un fresco real, que se te mete en casa, que entras tú en ello como observador cómplice en una obra de vanguardia, en todas y cada una de las escenas de la sin duda una de las mejores películas de la historia. Que va de cómo en un ambiente de represión, los años 50 de América con la segregación racial, donde un hombre lucha por su familia trabajando en el departamento recolector de residuos y gradualmente el espectador, que penetra en la obra como un actor más, como un viviente más, va descubriendo que el sufrido y abnegado trabajador no es más que un necio violento que engañó a su mujer impidiéndole trabajar para luego restregarle por las narices que ella sólo es gracias a él, que lleva todos los meses dinero a casa, para que sus hijos coman, ella coma, todos tengan zapatos y una vida digna. Así, el protagonista es el centro del mundo, ha generado una historia de su pasado de pobreza y esfuerzos infernales para justificarse, aun en hechos que él cree justos: todo lo cree justo, todo lo que viene de él, porque (lo repite en muchos momentos de la película) su única misión a cumplir es 'preocuparse' por los suyos, yendo a trabajar todos los días, se entiende. Porque ni es afectivo, sino todo lo contrario. Y es más, engaña a la mujer con otra mujer con la que incluso tiene un hijo... Y lo justifica en que lleva 18 años \"cumpliendo\" en esa casa, dejándose el alma, y \"yo también merezco levantar la cara y sonreír, tomar aire\". En fin, recomiendo la película, es un poema completo y rotundo. No es bonita en el sentido popularizado de bonita, es muy dura y cruda. Se aleja de los papeles que protagoniza Denzel, que son heroicos y donde siempre nos enternece y gusta. Aquí, el papel que hace, ese personaje, lo odiamos desde los primeros minutos de la película, es lo más despreciable del humano: un pisoteado que pisa.\nEsa es toda la humanidad. Pisoteados que pisan. Escupidos que escupen. Pero sin embargo, privilegiados. No es lo mismo vivir en una parte del mundo que en otra. Vivir en la parte que ha robado y se nutre de los suministros que les son pertenencia a los habitantes de los países de los que se les expolia todo, que vivir en esos países desérticos hasta del haber sentido la esperanza, no saben nada de la esperanza. Es peor por tanto en la literatura de la vida quien, teniendo techo, ducha, agua del grifo para beber y cama, se sienta escupido y escupa. Mucho peor.\nMi padre después de liarla parda, en general se ponía luego a llorar, a quejarse, a prometer que no volvería a ocurrir. En fin. De manual. Y luego se escudaba, además, en su infancia, en que mira yo tengo esto malo que no sé qué es y que viví y sufrí y que me sale, me estalla, cuando tú haces esto o lo otro entonces entre todos debemos pararlo saber pararlo porque yo soy un buen hombre un buen padre voy a trabajar tenéis el plato en la mesa tres veces al día gracias a mi esfuerzo así que que esto se convierta en perfecto y tengamos paz no depende de mí depende de todos que papá no tenga que bullir como una olla que alguien se olvidó al fuego, sabes, mujer? Entonces si no te pintas tanto como una puta y no enseñas la parte de arriba del pecho ni tardas cuando vas al pan porque hablas con el panadero todo irá bien si al final la culpa la tienes tú la tenéis todos. No me busquéis.\nEntonces fui escribiendo libros de poesía, varios, algunos fueron saliendo, publicados, sí. Qué momentos. Y pensé en la muerte, tantas veces, en realidad constantemente. Mi madre dice que pobrecita Ana Rosa Quintana y yo le digo que es una merdera que apoya la derecha y ultraderecha y que va a los toros. Mamá, me queda bien el jersey negro que me compraste, creí que me quedaba demasiado apretado pero es cierto lo que dijiste, estíralo que cede.\nAsí todo. Estíralo que cede. Todo un poema, todo verso, la poesía es la lengua más abierta. Es lo contrario a los muros, es lo más antónimo de la muerte.\nAhora colegas están metiendo caña para que los mierdas que están pensando en cepillarse a los flamencos de la Albufera (Valencia), no lo hagan. El humano, lo contrario al poema casi siempre, incluso desde el ecologetismo, piden \"soluciones\" para los muchos flamencos que se pasean por los campos de arroz, destruyendo el cultivo y comiéndoselo, según los agricultores. Pues mira, Rosa Más explica lo que ocurre, los flamencos van allí porque huyen del lugar donde estaban y que por el cambio climático (producido por el humano) o por costumbres del humano que les son más cercanas en lo diacrónico, se ven obligados a desplazarse para encontrar lugar donde asentarse y vivir. Esos flamencos somos los niños mis hermanos y hermanas cuando sentíamos un peligro y un miedo constante.\nEntre esos flamencos está el vagabundo al que le dediqué el poema \"Yo creo que eres poema\", está. Yo estoy entre esos flamencos. Subidos al poema vivimos y no nos damos cuenta de cuánta pluma inocente podemos tocar, está cerca de nuestro olfato y piel. No escuchamos los gritos. Deberíamos más a menudo pasearnos por los cementerios, te da qué pensar. Que eso está allí. La gran epopeya de cada uno, al mismo tiempo el acto sencillo, uno entre tantos, de todas las vidas.\n¿Qué sentí al enterarme de lo de mi padre? Nada. Ni bueno ni malo. Nada de nada. Porque a mí me recuerdan un día bonito, un campo que me embriagó, la primera vez que visité el mar, de chiquito, y me estremezco. Con otras cosas, no. Ante la contemplación de un muro, nada siento. Sí, vacío.\nY en todo, el poema, repito, lo siento ahora con sus antenas y nervios de versos eternos subido a mi espalda vigilando lo que escribo, aconsejándome o callado, callada la poema y acompañándome en mi vida, como a todas vosotras, con su sombrilla de colores o con sus zapatos azules de cielo. La poema. El poemo que diría Jesús Lizano.\nNo quiero que paséis buenas navidades ni buen fin de año, porque os conozco y sé que eso significaría que han tenido que morir muchos animales para vuestra felicidad criminal. Quiero que no pensemos en años, ni en festividades, ni en mierdas de ese estilo inventadas por el humano para llenar su vida de vacíos de ñordas que bufan crueldades.\nTermino este escrito con la palabra flamenco. Para que lo pienses. Con la palabra niño. Con la palabra invierno y diciéndote: cree en ti, pero en tu yo bueno. Ya sabes, tu yo malo, excrétalo; no, no es difícil, es fácil.\nEs como cuando escribo un poema, o cualquier texto, normalmente viene luego el dejarlo descansar y la economía de palabras, la poda.\nCuando uno ve una película, al día siguiente sabe cuánto le ha gustado o si le ha visto errores o defectos.\nDicen que el sol algún día se apagará, tal cual. Pero también dicen que los científicos son buena gente, y no es así. Y que los médicos buscan nuestro bienestar, tampoco lo es. En nuestro universo poético no hay ningún sol que se apague algún día, pues brilla siempre.\nIros todos a tomar por culo, que jodan a 2024. Sólo aceptaré las manos de hierba que quieran cantar, cantar con todos y todas.\nFlamenco 2024, huye, que el humano sigue empecinado en dejar de leer poesía.\nEsterilizar a los humanos es la solución, según estudios\n|No quiero que paséis buenas navidades ni buen fin de año, porque os conozco y sé que eso significaría que han tenido que morir muchos animales para vuestra felicidad criminal|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nY me preguntaba, cuando era pequeño, el sentido de la vida.

Y lo justifica en que lleva 18 años \"cumpliendo\" en esa casa, dejándose el alma, y \"yo también merezco levantar la cara y sonreír, tomar aire\". En fin, recomiendo la película, es un poema completo y rotundo. No es bonita en el sentido popularizado de bonita, es muy dura y cruda. Se aleja de los papeles que protagoniza Denzel, que son heroicos y donde siempre nos enternece y gusta. Aquí, el papel que hace, ese personaje, lo odiamos desde los primeros minutos de la película, es lo más despreciable del humano: un pisoteado que pisa.\nEsa es toda la humanidad. Pisoteados que pisan. Escupidos que escupen. Pero sin embargo, privilegiados. No es lo mismo vivir en una parte del mundo que en otra. Vivir en la parte que ha robado y se nutre de los suministros que les son pertenencia a los habitantes de los países de los que se les expolia todo, que vivir en esos países desérticos hasta del haber sentido la esperanza, no saben nada de la esperanza. Es peor por tanto en la literatura de la vida quien, teniendo techo, ducha, agua del grifo para beber y cama, se sienta escupido y escupa. Mucho peor.\nMi padre después de liarla parda, en general se ponía luego a llorar, a quejarse, a prometer que no volvería a ocurrir. En fin. De manual. Y luego se escudaba, además, en su infancia, en que mira yo tengo esto malo que no sé qué es y que viví y sufrí y que me sale, me estalla, cuando tú haces esto o lo otro entonces entre todos debemos pararlo saber pararlo porque yo soy un buen hombre un buen padre voy a trabajar tenéis el plato en la mesa tres veces al día gracias a mi esfuerzo así que que esto se convierta en perfecto y tengamos paz no depende de mí depende de todos que papá no tenga que bullir como una olla que alguien se olvidó al fuego, sabes, mujer? Entonces si no te pintas tanto como una puta y no enseñas la parte de arriba del pecho ni tardas cuando vas al pan porque hablas con el panadero todo irá bien si al final la culpa la tienes tú la tenéis todos. No me busquéis.\nEntonces fui escribiendo libros de poesía, varios, algunos fueron saliendo, publicados, sí. Qué momentos. Y pensé en la muerte, tantas veces, en realidad constantemente. Mi madre dice que pobrecita Ana Rosa Quintana y yo le digo que es una merdera que apoya la derecha y ultraderecha y que va a los toros. Mamá, me queda bien el jersey negro que me compraste, creí que me quedaba demasiado apretado pero es cierto lo que dijiste, estíralo que cede.\nAsí todo. Estíralo que cede. Todo un poema, todo verso, la poesía es la lengua más abierta. Es lo contrario a los muros, es lo más antónimo de la muerte.\nAhora colegas están metiendo caña para que los mierdas que están pensando en cepillarse a los flamencos de la Albufera (Valencia), no lo hagan. El humano, lo contrario al poema casi siempre, incluso desde el ecologetismo, piden \"soluciones\" para los muchos flamencos que se pasean por los campos de arroz, destruyendo el cultivo y comiéndoselo, según los agricultores. Pues mira, Rosa Más explica lo que ocurre, los flamencos van allí porque huyen del lugar donde estaban y que por el cambio climático (producido por el humano) o por costumbres del humano que les son más cercanas en lo diacrónico, se ven obligados a desplazarse para encontrar lugar donde asentarse y vivir. Esos flamencos somos los niños mis hermanos y hermanas cuando sentíamos un peligro y un miedo constante.\nEntre esos flamencos está el vagabundo al que le dediqué el poema \"Yo creo que eres poema\", está. Yo estoy entre esos flamencos. Subidos al poema vivimos y no nos damos cuenta de cuánta pluma inocente podemos tocar, está cerca de nuestro olfato y piel. No escuchamos los gritos. Deberíamos más a menudo pasearnos por los cementerios, te da qué pensar. Que eso está allí. La gran epopeya de cada uno, al mismo tiempo el acto sencillo, uno entre tantos, de todas las vidas.\n¿Qué sentí al enterarme de lo de mi padre? Nada. Ni bueno ni malo. Nada de nada. Porque a mí me recuerdan un día bonito, un campo que me embriagó, la primera vez que visité el mar, de chiquito, y me estremezco. Con otras cosas, no. Ante la contemplación de un muro, nada siento. Sí, vacío.\nY en todo, el poema, repito, lo siento ahora con sus antenas y nervios de versos eternos subido a mi espalda vigilando lo que escribo, aconsejándome o callado, callada la poema y acompañándome en mi vida, como a todas vosotras, con su sombrilla de colores o con sus zapatos azules de cielo. La poema. El poemo que diría Jesús Lizano.\nNo quiero que paséis buenas navidades ni buen fin de año, porque os conozco y sé que eso significaría que han tenido que morir muchos animales para vuestra felicidad criminal. Quiero que no pensemos en años, ni en festividades, ni en mierdas de ese estilo inventadas por el humano para llenar su vida de vacíos de ñordas que bufan crueldades.\nTermino este escrito con la palabra flamenco. Para que lo pienses. Con la palabra niño. Con la palabra invierno y diciéndote: cree en ti, pero en tu yo bueno. Ya sabes, tu yo malo, excrétalo; no, no es difícil, es fácil.\nEs como cuando escribo un poema, o cualquier texto, normalmente viene luego el dejarlo descansar y la economía de palabras, la poda.\nCuando uno ve una película, al día siguiente sabe cuánto le ha gustado o si le ha visto errores o defectos.\nDicen que el sol algún día se apagará, tal cual. Pero también dicen que los científicos son buena gente, y no es así. Y que los médicos buscan nuestro bienestar, tampoco lo es. En nuestro universo poético no hay ningún sol que se apague algún día, pues brilla siempre.\nIros todos a tomar por culo, que jodan a 2024. Sólo aceptaré las manos de hierba que quieran cantar, cantar con todos y todas.\nFlamenco 2024, huye, que el humano sigue empecinado en dejar de leer poesía.\nA punto de clausurar el año, o de emprender uno nuevo, nos hacemos conscientes del paso del tiempo. Y, merodeando por la Red, leo que “vivimos una sociedad que ensalza la juventud y niega el proceso natural de envejecimiento invitando a disimular sus efectos sobre el aspecto físico y a realizar actividades de ocio que transmitan una imagen juvenil”.\nSegún la Organización Mundial de la Salud, la salud mental es un estado de bienestar en el cual el individuo es consciente de sus propias capacidades, puede afrontar las tensiones normales de la vida, puede trabajar de forma productiva y fructífera y es capaz de hacer una contribución a su comunidad.",
