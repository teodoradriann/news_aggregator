    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Desde o início da ofensiva da Ucrânia em território russo, um aumento significativo no descontentamento com o presidente Vladimir Putin foi observado na Rússia. A análise realizada pela FilterLabs AI e divulgada nesta 5ª feira (22.ago.2024) mostra um aumento nas críticas da população ao presidente russo, especialmente no interior do país.\nPara a análise, a empresa monitorou opiniões por meio de mídias sociais e outras postagens na internet. Foram encontradas diversas mensagens afirmando que a invasão ucraniana contra a Rússia se deu por culpa de Putin.\nFormulário de cadastro alertas grátis do Poder360 concordo com os termos da LGPD . Inscreva-se Inscreva-se O levantamento foi feito de 6 a 16 de agosto. Não foram divulgados números de comentários e textos jornalísticos analisados. A agregadora de dados afirma que os comentários sobre Putin recuaram até 0,4 ponto e está próximo a 0 em uma métrica que varia de 1 a -1, onde -1 representa “total descontentamento” .\nA ofensiva de Kiev contra o território russo iniciou-se em 12 de agosto. O governo de Volodymyr Zelensky (Servo do Povo, centro) afirma controlar cerca de 1.000 km² de Kursk. Cerca de 121 mil pessoas foram evacuadas da área afetada.\nA FilterLabs AI também encontrou divergência entre as notícias publicadas por mídias de alcance regional e grandes mídias nacionais russas e de Moscou, onde o Kremlin consegue ter maior influência.\nDe acordo com a reportagem, jornais nacionais e de Moscou costumam focar na ajuda humanitária prestada aos russos residentes em Kursk, a região russa agora controlada por Kiev.\nA perda de popularidade nas regiões onde o Kremlin concentra seus esforços de recrutamento militar é outro fator que pode complicar a capacidade do governo de manter o conflito na Ucrânia, segundo a FilterLabs AI.\nO movimento de perda de apoio de Putin depois da invasão ucraniana contrasta com o aumento da popularidade do líder depois de acabar com o motim organizado pelo Yevgeny Prighozin, ex-chefe do Grupo Wagner, uma força paramilitar russa.\nA insurgência começou quando Prigozhin disse que o ministro da Defesa da Rússia da época, Serguei Choigu, estava enganando o presidente Putin e a população do país.",

    "text": "Reagindo na Série B do Campeonato Brasileiro, o Guarani colou nos adversários da zona de rebaixamento e ganhou fôlego na disputa. O técnico Allan Aal encontrou o time base e vem fazendo poucas alterações. Ele confirmou que a tendência é que a escalação seja mantida no confronto com o América-MG.\n“É muito da resposta que os atletas estão dando dentro de campo. A partir do momento que a equipe se consolida com atuações e resultados, não precisamos ficar buscando alternativas. Precisamos, sim, ter opções, mas vejo nosso time consistente”, disse o Aal.\nMesmo assim, o treinador espera que todos os jogadores continuem dando o máximo para que a competitividade interna beneficie o clube. “Essa competitividade interna é positiva. É continuar jogando, com personalidade e coragem, mesmo às vezes sem estar no melhor momento.”\nNa primeira partida pelo Guarani, na derrota por 3 a 1 para o Ceará, Allan Aal escalou Vladimir; Pacheco, Douglas Bacelar, Matheus Salustiano e Jefferson; Matheus Bueno, Gabriel Bispo e Luan Dias; Airton, João Victor e Caio Dantas.\nDepois disso, só alterou por necessidade e voltou a repetir a escalação no último jogo, em que venceu o Coritiba por 2 a 1. Sem suspensos, ele terá a chance usar novamente o time considerado ideal.\nCom 14 pontos nos últimos sete jogos, o Guarani alcançou 21 pontos e colou de vez nos adversários, apesar de continuar na lanterna (20º). O CRB, primeiro fora do Z-4, tem 25, seguido por Brusque (23), Ituano (22) e Chapecoense (22).\nO time de Campinas possui um jogo a menos, diante do Botafogo-SP, em Ribeirão Preto. O duelo com o América-MG, pela 25ª rodada, será realizado no domingo, às 18h30, na Arena Independência, em Belo Horizonte (MG).",
