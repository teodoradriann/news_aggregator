    "text": "RNC's Tommy Pigott Discusses Impact of Weather on Iowa Caucuses, Future of DeSantis and Haley's Campaigns\nDonald Trump Triumphs: A Powerful Start to the 2024 Presidential Campaign\nDonald Trump, former President of the United States, has once again left an indelible mark in the annals of American politics. With a victorious performance in the Iowa caucuses, a crucial juncture in the presidential nominating process for the 2024 United States elections, Trump has firmly established his position as a strong contender.\nTrump’s Triumph and Vision for America\nDuring his victory speech, Trump adeptly balanced a celebration of his campaign’s strengths with an outline of his vision for the country’s future. His address was a tour de force of policy issues and campaign promises, effectively setting the tone for his campaign trajectory.\nWith gratitude, Trump acknowledged his supporters and the tireless efforts of his campaign team. He emphasized the importance of the Iowa win as a momentum-builder for his candidacy, signaling his readiness to compete in subsequent primaries and caucuses.\nA Critique of the Current Administration\nNever one to shy away from controversy, Trump also seized the opportunity to critique his political opponents and the current administration. He argued that a change in leadership is necessary to tackle the multifaceted challenges that America faces in today’s rapidly evolving global landscape.\nImplications of the Iowa Win\nTrump’s win in Iowa suggests a solid base of support within the Republican Party, which could significantly impact the strategies of other candidates in the race. His strong showing in the caucuses, where he outperformed Governor Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, is a testament to his enduring appeal among a significant faction of the party’s base.\nTrump’s victory speech, punctuated with chants of ‘America First’ from the crowd, was not just a celebration of his win, but a clear declaration of his intent to once again lead the nation. How this plays out in the upcoming primaries and caucuses, and whether this win translates into a successful nomination, remains to be seen.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/politics/rncs-tommy-pigott-discusses-impact-of-weather-on-iowa-caucuses-future-of-desantis-and-haleys-campaigns/ []https://bnnbreaking.com/breaking-news/health/willow-biosciences-and-enterin-join-forces-to-develop-sustainable-pharmaceutical-manufacturing-methods/ []https://bnnbreaking.com/sports/liverpool-born-tyias-brownings-remarkable-career-transformation-from-everton-to-chinas-national-team/",

    "title": "NLRB General Counsel Targets Non-Competes and Stay-or-Pay Provisions",
    "text": "Last week, the National Labor Relations Board’s General Counsel Jennifer A. Abruzzo (the “GC”) announced her position that “stay-or-pay” provisions in employment agreements are unlawful under the National Labor Relations Act (the “NLRA”). The GC also reiterated and built on an earlier memo in which she took the position that almost all non-competes are similarly unlawful under the NLRA because they infringe on “Section 7” rights (which include the right to union and engage in other “protected concerted activity”). Employers—even if “non-union”—should consider the following questions.\n“Non-union” employers sometimes believe (mistakenly) that the NLRB has no jurisdiction over them. In fact, most private sector employees are at least covered by the NLRA. Some employees in certain industries (railroads, airlines) and employees of very small employers with insufficient connection to interstate commerce are excluded from the NLRA. “Managerial employees” and “supervisors” do not have Section 7 rights, but those terms are narrowly defined. “Managerial employees” means those with power to set employer policy or deviate from established policy, and “supervisors” must truly supervise other employees (with power to hire, fire and discipline, for example, or effectively recommend those actions). As a starting point, employers should determine which of its employees have rights under the NLRA.\nThe NLRB has the final say regarding rights conferred by the NLRA. But the GC, and a number of regional and field offices, have independent authority to investigate charges accusing employers of unfair labor practices (“ULP”). The GC periodically issues memos providing guidance on how the NLRA should be interpreted, and how regional offices should investigate and bring complaints based on ULPs. The GC’s memos do not have the force of law, but they provide an important alert to both employers and employees regarding the GC’s policy objectives and intended course of action in responding to ULP charges. Employers on the receiving end of a ULP may bring legal challenges testing the GC’s extension of the NLRA to restrictive covenants, but for now, the GC’s memo will inform enforcement actions—and the GC has made clear she expects the NLRB’s regional offices to pursue complaints against employers with regard to non-competes and “stay or pay” provisions.\nLast year, the GC took the position that most non-competes unlawfully chill the exercise of Section 7 rights. The GC reasoned that non-competes could be construed by employees to “deny them the ability to quit or change jobs by cutting off their access to other employment opportunities.” Therefore, employees may be “chilled” from advocating for better working conditions because of fear that they would have difficulty replacing lost income if discharged for exercising their rights. Employees bound by non-competes may also be less likely to make concerted threats to resign as leverage to improve employment conditions.\nThe GC conceded that some “narrowly tailored” non-competes might be justified by “special circumstances.” However, the GC provided no examples. Instead, the GC provided examples of business interests and justifications that would not justify a non-compete: retaining employees and protecting investments in training those employees, or an employer’s interest in protecting proprietary or trade secret information which the GC argued “can be addressed by narrowly tailored workplace agreements.” Employers should work from the assumption that the GC believes most non-competes unlawfully chill the exercise of Section 7 rights.\nUnder a “stay-or-pay” agreement, an employee is subject to a monetary penalty or repayment obligation for leaving their employment. For example, an employer may require an employee to reimburse the employer for moving costs, training fees, or educational expenses if the employee leaves. The GC’s position is that stay-or-pay agreements are presumptively unlawful because they hold a potentially significant debt over an employee’s head that could discourage them from engaging in any behavior that displeases the employer—including the exercise of Section 7 rights—for fear of being terminated, triggering that debt obligation. The GC went so far as to compare the financial penalties of stay-or-pay agreements to indentured servitude.\nThat said, the GC recognizes that some stay-or-pay provisions could be narrowly tailored to protect legitimate business interests. For example, a stay-or-pay agreement can be enforced if it is optional, offered in exchange for a benefit, contains a “reasonable” and specific repayment amount and “stay” period, and foregoes repayment if the employee is terminated without cause. Employers should carefully review any existing stay-or-pay agreements to ensure they meet these criteria.\nRegional Offices may seek “make-whole relief” for employees who can demonstrate that they lost opportunities for other employment as a result of unlawful employment agreement provisions. For example, the NLRB may order an employer to pay an employee the difference between the pay and benefits they would have received at a better-paying job for which they were qualified but could not apply due to their fear of violating a non-compete. However, with respect to stay-or-pay agreements, employers have a 60-day grace period (i.e. through December 6, 2024) to revise preexisting unlawful stay-or-pay agreements to the GC’s criteria discussed above. Any new stay-or-pay agreement entered into after October 7 must immediately comply with the criteria stated above.\nBased on comments in the GC’s memoranda, it seems like that she will view employe non-solicitation covenants as a violation of Section 7 rights. However, narrowly tailored customer non-solicitation covenants may be permissible - especially if limited to customers with whom the employee had material business contact.\nEmployers who have employment agreements with non-competes and stay-or-pay agreements should consult counsel. This is especially important for employers that include non-compete provisions in agreements with employees who are covered by the NLRA—including, for example, middle managers and sales employees. Employers that continue to include non-competes in agreements with such employees do so at the risk of an unfair practice charge, and potential “make-whole” remedies by the NLRB.\nEmployers may also consider whether employment provisions other than non-competes and stay-or-pay agreements can achieve the same business interests. For example, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements may protect trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, and the GC has acknowledged they are likely still enforceable. And, as noted above, appropriately tailored customer non-solicitation provisions may also be permissible. Employers should also consult state law restrictions on post-employment restrictive covenants, as this article focuses only on the NLRB GC’s position regarding these provisions.\nThe GC’s most recent memorandum may be subject to legal challenges; it may even face the same fate as the Federal Trade Commission’s broad rule prohibiting most non-compete agreements, which has been enjoined by a federal court. Additionally, depending on the results of the upcoming presidential election, the NLRB’s position on these and other issues could change substantially: GC Abruzzo may be replaced, and the composition of the NLRB’s Board could change. Employers should contact their employment and labor counsel to review their employment agreements and consider their options.\n[View source.]\nSee more »\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.

    "text": "Pet foods with ethical ingredients offer a better and safer choice for animals, people, and the planet.\nIn recent years, pet parents have been looking more closely at the ingredients in dog and cat food, and the importance of choosing ethically sourced ingredients is becoming clearer. Ethical food ingredients are produced, sourced, and processed with environmental sustainability, animal welfare, fair labor practices, and social responsibility in mind. Here are six reasons to choose pet foods made with responsibly sourced ingredients.\n1. Better for the planet\nPet food producers who prioritize ethical ingredients work with farmers who take steps to minimize the environmental impact of food production. These steps can include using sustainable farming methods, decreasing waste, reducing carbon emissions, and supporting local producers.\n2. Improved animal welfare\nThe human treatment of animals is an important philosophy in ethical ingredient sourcing. This includes practices and standards that ensure the physical and psychological well-being of the animals, such as:\n- Providing proper living conditions\n- Giving access to food and water\n- Minimizing stress and suffering\n- Providing healthcare\n- Using gentle handling techniques\n- Ensuring the animals can express natural behaviors.\n3. Food safety\nMany pet food companies that embrace ethical ingredients also have stricter internal quality control practices that protect the safety of dogs and cats.\n4. Complete transparency\nSimilarly, pet food companies that strive to responsibly source ingredients often have transparency policies regarding their sourcing and production methods, labor practices, social and environmental performance, accountability, and more.\n5. Better for people\nThe way these ingredients are harvested benefit workers by prioritizing fair labor practices and supporting local communities.\n6. Superior nutrition\nDog and cat food companies that care about ethical ingredients formulate their foods for complete and balanced nutrition. This can include:\n- Selecting the highest quality ingredients\n- Avoiding fillers and artificial binders\n- Choosing fresh food and minimally processing it\n- Selecting biologically appropriate ingredients.\nWhy ZIWI?\n[ZIWI’s](https://us.ziwipets.com) dedication to ethical ingredients has been at the heart of their company since the beginning. They work with local farmers who use ethical farming practices that support environmental and animal welfare. They use premium ingredients like ethically raised beef and lamb, free-range chicken, and wild-caught seafood. And they produce safe, nutrient-dense recipes for dogs and cats that are biologically appropriate and better for animals, people, and the planet.\nAUTHOR PROFILE\nAnimal Wellness is North America's top natural health and lifestyle magazine for dogs and cats, with a readership of over one million every year. AW features articles by some of the most renowned experts in the pet industry, with topics ranging from diet and health related issues, to articles on training, fitness and emotional well being.",

    "text": "Las alertas por fuertes lluvias se activarán este sábado en la Comunitat Valenciana, Cataluña y Baleares, según la predicción de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet). En concreto, Mallorca y Menorca activarán alertas naranjas hasta el amanecer y Tarragona mantendrá esta misma alerta durante toda la jornada por el mismo fenómeno, mientras que Barcelona y Girona contarán con alertas amarillas durante la madrugada por lluvias y fenómenos costeros. En la Comunidad Valenciana, la provincia de Castellón mantendrá la alerta amarilla por fuertes durante todo el día, en tanto que Alicante y Valencia activarán alertas amarillas por lluvias durante las primeras horas de la madrugada. Aemet ha puesto el foco en la previsión de chubascos y tormentas fuertes y persistentes en el sur y litorales de Cataluña, Castellón y Baleares, así como a primeras horas en zonas del sur de la Comunitat Valenciana, pudiendo llegar a ser muy fuertes en el entorno del bajo Ebro y nordeste del archipiélago; ligado a esto, se esperan intervalos fuertes de viento en puntos del litoral catalán. En un plano general, la agencia ha apuntado que se prevé que se produzca una transición hacia una situación de mayor estabilidad, si bien han recordado que la DANA aún dejará precipitaciones en Andalucía occidental y oeste de Alborán, además del ya mencionado nordeste del país. También son posibles chubascos dispersos en el resto de Andalucía, Murcia, ambas mesetas y montañas del extremo norte, mientras que en Canarias predominarán los intervalos nubosos tendiendo a aumentar, con probabilidad de dejar chubascos dispersos en las islas montañosas. En lo referente a las temperaturas, las máximas irán en aumento en el suroeste peninsular y descenderán en litorales cantábricos y entorno de la Ibérica oriental-bajo Ebro, en tanto que las mínimas bajarán ligeramente por lo general, con posibles heladas débiles en cumbres de Pirineos y Sierra Nevada. Sobre los vientos, la Aemet ha pronosticado que predominarán de componente este en la Península y Baleares, en general flojos en interiores y más intensos en litorales, con probables intervalos de fuerza en el Estrecho junto al ya mencionado litoral catalán. En Canarias soplarán vientos flojos predominando las componentes norte y este, y tendiendo a rolar a suroeste en las islas occidentales.",
