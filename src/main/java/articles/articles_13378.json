    "text": "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to impact the earth later on Thursday. As a result, the Space Weather Prediction Center has issued a rare watch. The last severe storm watch was in May. During that storm, G5 levels were achieved and we had our best aurora in years. The aurora could be seen at times with our own eyes, and was very vivid on our phones using the low light setting. While G3-G4 levels are ethe most likely outcome, we cannot rule out a G5 storm once again. If G5 levels are not seen with this storm, G4 levels would still bring the northern lights overhead for all of Mid-Michigan. That best case scenario would also bring sights of the northern lights as far south as the Carolinas to California. The moon will also be below the horizon for most of the night, allowing us to find the aurora without any extra light. The best news with this opportunity is the skies will be clear. Everything is lining up for a really nice look at the lights, as long as the storm arrives on time and is as strong as it is forecast to be. If you are planning to go out, make sure to get away from light pollution. It will be quite chilly in the 40s along with some wind, so be sure to bundle up! The last piece of advice is you will want to wait an hour or so after sunset. Our current forecast has the strongest portion of the storm coming through from sunset to 2 AM.",

    "title": "Spring, Summer Have Underrated Weather Threats That Make It A Deadly Time Of Year | Weather Underground",
    "text": "Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists.\nS&a;#8203;pring and summer are the deadliest time of year for weather hazards in the U.S., and while natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes often make the biggest headlines, there are a few types weather-related phenomena that fly under the radar and account for a large number of deaths annually.\nK&a;#8203;eep these threats and safety tips in mind through the coming months.\nBeachgoers face and underrated weather danger that kills dozens annually . Rip currents killed an average of 71 people each year from 2013 to 2022, the third most for any category of weather-related fatalities in NOAA&s;s statistics.\nRip currents can develop at any beach with breaking waves , and in the five years ending in 2022, most states along the Gulf, East and West coasts as well as along the Great Lakes shoreline have had deaths related to rip currents. Florida has the most deaths by far with 105, followed by North Carolina and Texas with 29 and 28, respectively.\nTips to protect your safety at the beach: Take note of the rip current risk if you are planning a day at the beach. There are color-coded flags placed on many beaches each day to communicate the current threat. You can also get a daily rip current forecast from NOAA .\nE&a;#8203;xtreme heat leads the way when it comes to weather-related deaths. There has been an average of 176 heat-related deaths each year in the U.S., according to the 2013-2022 average from NOAA&s;s Natural Hazard Statistics.\nOne of last year&s;s billion-dollar disasters - heat and drought in the Midwest and South - should serve as a reminder since 247 people were killed by it from spring through fall , primarily because of excessive heat.\nTips to stay safe from extreme heat: Heat safety should be a priority in summer by taking these precautions : Stay hydrated and take breaks if outdoors. Check on vulnerable people such as the elderly and children, especially if air conditioning is unavailable.\nF&a;#8203;looding is usually the biggest storm-related killer. NOAA says an average of 104 deaths per year have been caused by flooding, or more than twice the average of tornadoes. In recent years, the toll has been as high as 189 deaths in 2015 and 146 fatalities in 2021.\nFlooding can happen anytime of year, but warmer temperatures from spring into summer make it more likely because of the potential for heavier rainfall rates. In fact, flash flooding in the U.S. has an annual peak that occurs from late-spring through summer.\nTip to stay safe from floods: When heavy rain threatens, never try to drive through a flooded road. Over half of deaths in floods happen in vehicles, according to NOAA statistics .\nB&a;#8203;e aware of lightning when planning outdoor activities. Deaths from lightning have decreased when compared to decades ago , but an average of 22 people have still lost their life annually from 2013 to 2022. Hundreds more people are injured , NOAA says.\nM&a;#8203;ore people are outdoors in spring and summer, so a majority of lightning deaths happen during this time of year.\nL&a;#8203;ast year had the fewest lightning deaths on record with 14. The decrease in the death toll from lightning in recent years is a testament to technology, including lightning detection, improved forecasting and increased awareness.\nTips to protect yourself from lightning: If you have outdoor activities planned, be sure you know where you can shelter from lightning. If you hear thunder, then it&s;s time to move indoors no matter how faint or loud it sounds.\nChris Dolce has been a senior meteorologist with weather.com for over 10 years after beginning his career with The Weather Channel in the early 2000s.\n\\n",

    "text": "For many Canadians, a look outside their window this week will reveal a gloomy sight. Grey skies are all too common in the winter months when the days are shorter than ever. So is seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\nAccording to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), SAD is a type of seasonal depression.\n“Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that occurs during the same season each year. It usually happens in the fall or winter, but some people may experience season-linked symptoms in the summer,” the CAMH website says.\nDr. Robert Levitan is the Cameron Parker Holcombe Wilson Chair in Depression Studies at CAMH and the University of Toronto, and a professor of psychiatry at U of T.\n“SAD is a tendency for some people during the fall and winter, as the days get very short, to experience symptoms of depression,” he told Global News. It can have clear signs, Dr. Levitan said.\nStory continues below advertisement “(People have) feelings of fatigue, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal. Another part of it is overeating. There’s a lot of people whose primary problem is that they crave carbohydrates and other foods and gain a lot of weight.”\nHe added, “(Symptoms include) oversleeping, overeating, feeling sluggish, not being able to get going in the morning and then negative thinking. For some people, it can even get into suicidal thinking if they have other risk factors for depression.”\nMore on Canada Fatal falls through ice: How a ‘balmy winter’ is raising safety concerns Exiting MPs share their views on the state of politics: ‘Toxic atmosphere’ Airlines urged to inspect Boeing 737 MAX planes for possible loose bolt 10 people rescued from plane crash site in remote area of Northwest Territories The Canadian Psychological Association says SAD or Depression with Seasonal Pattern is a condition that comes and goes based on seasonal changes, appearing in the fall and going away in the spring/summer.\n“People who get this, get it every year at the same time, and they start to anticipate it. And so it becomes a recurrent form of depression. And then just like it starts on its own, it goes away on its own, of course, at some point when the days get brighter,” Dr. Levitan said.\nGet the latest Health IQ news. Sent to your email, every week. A significant number of Canadians are affected by SAD every year.\n“It is estimated that SAD makes up 10% of all reported cases of depression. Approximately 15% of Canadians will report at least a mild case of SAD in their lifetime, while 2-3% will report serious cases,” according to the Canadian Psychological Association. “People with a family history of any form of depression may also be at risk of developing SAD. Canadians are particularly at risk, as we have decreased sunlight during the winter months.”\nStory continues below advertisement Dr. Levitan cautions people against self-diagnosing, instead urging people to speak to their primary-care physician. SAD, he said, is distinct from what some people refer to as “Winter Blues”.\n“The winter blues are a wave of low emotions that come with these cold, dark days,” the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) states on its website, “You may have heard people referring to this as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), but the winter blues and SAD are two different things.”\n5:52 Health Matters: Seasonal affective disorder So with winter solstice behind us and the days getting longer, does it mean people suffering from SAD are in the clear? Not quite, said Dr. Levitan.\n“There’s a lag of about two months (after winter solstice). The worst time of year is usually February. And then it starts to get better. And the best month is usually May-June and so forth in terms of mood.”\nTrending Now Cher files for conservatorship of son Elijah, claims his life is ‘at risk’ Powerball jackpot rises to $1 billion. See how Canadians can try their luck Story continues below advertisement He added that the stress of the holiday season, which can be a difficult time for many for different reasons, can have a compounding effect on SAD.\nSAD treatment options — and misconceptions A common misconception, Dr. Levitan said, was that having regular Vitamin D can help with SAD.\n“There’s no evidence that vitamin D works for seasonal affective disorder that I’m aware of,” he said, “It’s probably relevant to your general physical health. So, it’s still a good idea to supplement if you have low levels.”\nHe said, however, that there are treatments available. This includes light therapy, where patients of SAD are exposed to commercially available lights. He said two out of three patients respond to light therapy and don’t necessarily require medication.\nHe recommends only using light therapy “under the supervision of a doctor and to make sure its ultraviolet filtered, meaning that the ultraviolet component of the light is taken out because ultraviolet light is very dangerous to your eye.”\nStory continues below advertisement CMHA recommends people “get outside during the day if you can, keep your curtains open, and when indoors, spend as much time as you can near the windows. Even if it’s cloudy, getting some daylight can help boost your mood.”\nMaintaining regular exercise and sleep schedules can be crucial to battling SAD too. But the most important thing, CMHA states, is to be kind to yourself.\n“Battling low moods is no easy feat, and it’s important to be kind to yourself. You’re stronger than you think. Remember to have regular check-ins with yourself, and to spend that extra time on self-care if you need to,” CMHA said.\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis and needs help, resources are available. In case of an emergency, please call 911 for immediate help. For immediate mental health support, call 988.

    "text": "US regulators are probing Tesla’s smart remote driving system after its ‘Actually Smart Summon’ feature fails to detect obstacles. Is your Tesla actually that smart? US safety regulators are taking a closer look at a controversial feature that lets drivers summon their parked Teslas – without even being in the car. But it seems the tech isn’t as clever as promised, with reports of several accidents linked to this supposed ‘driverless’ feature.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a probe into Tesla’s ‘Actually Smart Summon’ technology, after a series of crashes revealed the system’s inability to detect obstacles like parked cars and posts. The issue has triggered a full-scale investigation into the safety of a feature available on 2.6 million vehicles since 2016, including the Model S, Model 3, and the Model X and Y SUVs.\nHow ‘Actually Smart’ is the Tesla summoning feature? The tech allows drivers to move their cars with the tap of a phone, but Tesla’s ambitious self-driving dreams may be getting tangled up in reality. At least four incidents have been reported in which cars went rogue while in ‘Actually Smart Summon’ mode. Fortunately, no one was injured, but the accidents have still raised serious concerns. NHTSA is also investigating its predecessor, ‘Smart Summon ‘, after a further dozen incidents were flagged.\nTesla, meanwhile, is staying quiet. As always, boss Elon Musk is behind the wheel, promoting self-driving as the future of transport. He’s always been outspoken about the technology being safer than regular driving – but does this latest investigation throw cold water on those claims?\nThe Tesla probe: A step toward a potential recall in the US and the UK and EU? The feature was designed by Tesla for use in private areas like driveways, not on public roads. Tesla’s own manual even warns that drivers need a clear line of sight between themselves and their car. But, with self-driving tech becoming more mainstream, it raises questions about how prepared these cars are for real-world challenges.\nThis probe could lead to a recall in the US and could potentially even trigger further investigations in Europe and the UK, adding to Tesla’s growing pile of scrutiny. The NHTSA will be looking into how fast the vehicles can go while in summon mode, and whether restrictions should be tightened to avoid accidents. Are regulators gearing up to putting the brakes on Musk’s ambitious autopilot dreams?\nStay tuned for more.\nRead more US news .\nRead more news in English from around Spain .\nRead more news in English from around Europe .\nTags: , , , , Share this story\nSign up for personalised news Subscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nDaily Weekly By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.

    "text": "“The shelter is for them to come in when it's hot and get cool, and when it's cool to come in and get warm. They can also come in and get a hot meal and just sit and relax and watch TV,” Shamera Kirk said. This Marlin shelter is more than your average warming center. Offering food, water, and a place to get warm, the J&K Warming Shelter is doing its best to provide for those in the community. This location was originally supposed to be a daycare, but after owner Betty Jefferson saw the need for shelters in her area, she knew exactly what she needed to do. “She saw a lot of people coming in and out that were homeless or they would come in just to get out the heat or come in here to sit down to get out the cold so she decided to open a warming and cooling shelter,” Kirk said. The J&K shelter has been a help to the Marlin community all year long. “It has helped out a lot. We recently had a fire in Marlin and the shelter housed some people. We also provided money for them to get motels just to have somewhere to stay,” Kirk said. The J&K Center told 25 News that they’ve seen an increase in visitors since the start of the cold front. The shelter is located at 110 Church Street and is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. “It’s the first shelter in Marlin and we hope to be around for a while,” Kirk said.

La delegación diplomática ha subrayado que \"Israel lucha en Gaza de acuerdo con el derecho internacional en una guerra contra Hamás que ni empezó ni quería, consecuencia de la masacre sin precedentes perpetrada el pasado 7 de octubre\". Además, ha resaltado que el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás) es \"un enemigo cruel que utiliza a su población como escudos humanos y que todavía mantiene secuestrados a 125 israelíes\". Robles ha declarado desde Oviedo, donde se ha celebrado este sábado el Día de las Fuerzas Armadas, que \"lo que está pasando en Gaza es un auténtico genocidio\". Robles ha resaltado que el reconocimiento del Estado palestino es \"una apuesta por la paz y por la convivencia de dos estados\", por lo ha que pedido \"mirarlo en positivo\". \"Esto no va contra nadie, esto no va contra el Estado israelí, esto no va contra los israelitas, que son personas a las que respetamos\", ha incidido, para insistir después en que el reconocimiento es también una apuesta para el \"cese la violencia en Gaza\". El Gobierno de Israel anunció este viernes su decisión de \"cortar la conexión entre la representación de España en Israel y los palestinos\" y \"prohibir\" que el Consulado en Jerusalén dé servicios a los palestinos residentes en Cisjordania tras el reconocimiento del Estado de Palestina, que entrará en vigor el 28 de mayo, y las declaraciones \"antisemitas\" de la vicepresidenta segunda del Gobierno, Yolanda Díaz, que usó un vídeo en apoyo al reconocimiento del Estado palestino la expresión \"desde el río hasta el mar\".

    "text": "Loading... Loading... Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. DNA reported its first-quarter financial results after the bell Thursday. Here's a look at the key figures from the report.\nThe Details:\nGinkgo Bioworks reported quarterly sales of $38 million which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $46.044 million by 17.47% and is a 52.91% decrease in sales year-over-year. The company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by the expected ramp down of K-12 testing in Ginkgo’s Biosecurity segment.\nGinkgo said Cell Engineering revenue was $28 million for the quarter, a decrease of 18% driven by a decline in revenue from early stage customers partially offset by growth from large/enterprise customers. Biosecurity revenue was $10 million with gross profit margin of 8% which the company said is reflective of the early stages of transition to a more recurring business model.\n“Ginkgo is an increasingly important part of the biotech ecosystem, and we are taking decisive action to keep it that way,” said Jason Kelly , CEO of Ginkgo. “We’ve demonstrated that we can serve a large number of diverse programs on a common platform, but I’m disappointed in our revenues in Q1. This trend needs to change, and we are simplifying both what we sell to customers and how we do the work that drives revenue at Ginkgo.”\nThe company announced a plan to achieve adjusted EBITDA break-even by the end of 2026 on an annualized run-rate basis.
