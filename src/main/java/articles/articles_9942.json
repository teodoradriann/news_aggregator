    "text": "Ice blamed for multiple crashes on Kent bridge Wednesday night Jeff Saunders Ravenna Record-Courier Kent safety forces were kept busy for about 90 minutes because of crashes involving nearly a dozen vehicles on the Fairchild Avenue bridge Wednesday night.\nPolice Lt. Mike Lewis said Thursday that dispatch logs showed as many as 11 vehicles involved in crashes that began at about 6:50 p.m., with police remaining on scene until about 8:20 p.m.\nLewis said there were two requests for ambulances and seven tow trucks were called. Lewis said, however, that he did not have any information about injuries or whether anyone was transported to a hospital.\nDue to a shift change since Wednesday night, information was not available Thursday from the Kent Fire Department.\nLewis said it appears that the bridge \"iced over pretty badly,\" causing vehicles to lose control. He said a city salt truck was called to salt the bridge.\n\"We would just remind people that the bridges ice over more quickly than do the roadways and to exercise caution,\" said Lewis.\nReporter Jeff Saunders can be reached at jsaunders@recordpub.com.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "The Fascinating World of Marine Life: Exploring the Depths of Our Oceans The ocean, a vast and mysterious realm, covers over 70% of our planet’s surface and holds a staggering diversity of life. From the tiniest plankton to the majestic whales, the marine world is a captivating tapestry of wonder and complexity. In this blog post, we’ll embark on a journey to explore the fascinating creatures that inhabit our oceans, delve into the ecological balance of these underwater ecosystems, and discuss the importance of conservation efforts. A World of Wonders: Discovering Marine Life The ocean is home to a mind-boggling array of species, each with its unique adaptations and ecological role. From the coral reefs teeming with vibrant fish to the deep-sea trenches inhabited by bizarre creatures, the marine world is a treasure trove of biodiversity. Fish: The Abundant Inhabitants Fish are the most abundant vertebrates on Earth, with over 30,000 known species. They come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, adapted to a wide range of habitats. Some fish, like the clownfish, live in symbiotic relationships with anemones, while others, like the tuna, are powerful predators that roam the open ocean. Marine Mammals: Giants of the Sea Marine mammals, such as whales, dolphins, seals, and sea lions, are highly intelligent and social creatures. Whales, in particular, are awe-inspiring giants that can grow to enormous sizes. These majestic creatures play a crucial role in maintaining the health of ocean ecosystems. Invertebrates: The Unsung Heroes Invertebrates, which include animals without backbones like jellyfish, corals, crabs, and starfish, make up the majority of marine life. These creatures are essential for the functioning of marine ecosystems, from filtering water to providing food for other animals. The Interconnectedness of Marine Ecosystems Marine ecosystems are interconnected and rely on a delicate balance to thrive. The food chain, for example, is a complex network of organisms that depend on each other for survival. Plankton, the microscopic organisms at the base of the food chain, are consumed by larger animals, which are in turn consumed by even larger predators. Coral Reefs: Biodiversity Hotspots Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, providing habitat for a vast array of marine life. These underwater cities are essential for the health of oceans, as they protect coastlines from erosion, provide food and income for coastal communities, and contribute to the global carbon cycle. Conservation Efforts: Protecting Our Oceans Human activities, such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change, are posing significant threats to marine ecosystems. It’s crucial to take action to protect our oceans and the life they support. Reducing Pollution Pollution from land-based sources, such as plastic waste and agricultural runoff, is contaminating oceans and harming marine life. We can reduce pollution by reducing our consumption of plastic, properly disposing of waste, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Sustainable Fishing Practices Overfishing is depleting fish stocks and disrupting marine ecosystems. Sustainable fishing practices, such as setting catch limits and using fishing gear that minimizes bycatch, are essential for ensuring the long-term health of fisheries. Addressing Climate Change Climate change is causing ocean acidification, warming waters, and sea level rise, which are having devastating impacts on marine life. We can mitigate climate change by reducing our carbon footprint and supporting efforts to transition to renewable energy sources. Conclusion The marine world is a fascinating and complex ecosystem that is essential for the health of our planet. By understanding the interconnectedness of marine life and the threats they face, we can take action to protect our oceans and ensure that future generations can enjoy the wonders of this incredible realm.",

Together, they're on a mission to elevate the insurance industry and reach underserved markets through Locker Room Insurance.\nJohnson Jr. , known for his Hall of Fame football career with the Detroit Lions, has been deeply engaged in community service since childhood, in part because he is the grandchild of a Baptist minister. His dedication led him to establish the Calvin Johnson Jr. Foundation , which has made a difference for nearly 13 years.\n\"The feeling you get from serving people is contagious. It feels great knowing I'm serving my neighbors and providing for families,\" Johnson Jr. said.\nSims , a nine-year NFL veteran who also played with the Lions, shared a similar sentiment. \"We're big on finding solutions that benefit other people. It fills us with excitement to empower those without similar opportunities, enabling them to secure their family's financial future and enhance the community.\"\nLocker Room Insurance\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8798/191320_bd8138025409e9b3_001full.jpg\nFreeman, a mission-driven executive known for his broad business acumen and servant leadership style, is equally excited about the program and its impact on the community.\n\"A quarter of the population doesn't have any type of insurance,\" Freeman observed. \"We want to be able to help. Rob and Calvin have a lot of people they love to help in various ways, but they can't take all of them to the NFL. They might also not be able to help them with other capital-intensive ventures. With insurance, they'll help many agents change their lives and their families' futures through a low barrier entrance, low capital insurance model.\"\nTo get an in-person look at how they operate, apply for an opportunity to attend the Locker Room Insurance launch party in the Detroit area later this year, where they will hosting a NFL Playoff watch party as well as providing a business overview for prospective agents.

In both Ghana and Ivory Coast, temperatures smashed historical records, climbing above 40°C (104°F).\nThe extreme heat has led to drought conditions which have persisted since February, drastically reducing crop yields and pushing up prices.\nThe price of raw cocoa has more than trebled in the last 12 months and more than doubled in the last three months alone.\nCurrently, the cost of cocoa has reached over £6,700 ($8,500) per tonne, according to Markets Insider, up from £2,030 ($2,600) per tonne this time last year.\nNormally, producers would purchase cocoa well in advance, insulating consumers from price shocks.\nHowever, the ECIU noted that the impacts of this volatile weather ‘has fed through to international commodity prices’.\nThe ECIU report also warned that this extreme weather is threatening other staple foods imported to the UK, including rice from India, coffee from Vietnam, tea from Kenya, and grapes from South Africa.\nThe vast majority of the UK’s chocolate comes from farms in Ghana (pictured) or Ivory Coast where a combination of wet heatwaves and drought have drastically reduced crop yields\nREAD MORE: Your sweet tooth is about to get more expensive! Cocoa prices are now DOUBLE what they were a year ago as El Nino weather wreaks havoc on global supply Worryingly, scientists say that ongoing human-induced climate change makes extreme weather conditions like this all the more likely.\nThis year’s extreme weather was in part fueled by a strong El Niño that has led to warmer weather conditions across the globe.\nEl Niño is a cyclical natural phenomenon in the tropical eastern Pacific which brings heat to the surface and can add an extra warming effect to the atmosphere and oceans.\nHowever, analysis from the World Weather Attribution Group suggests that climate change makes extreme temperatures 10 times more likely.\nThe researchers found that, if humanity does not quickly reduce its emissions, West Africa will experience similar heatwaves once every two years.\nMr Clarke says: ‘El Nino years often lead to challenges for farmers through changing patterns of weather.\n‘Increasingly, climate change, driven by fossil fuel use, is multiplying this natural challenge in many regions.’\nCocoa is especially vulnerable to these kinds of extreme weather challenges since it grows in such a select region.\nCocoa trees only grow in a narrow band of about 20 degrees around the equator.\nAccording to ECIU, 99 per cent of the world’s cocoa is grown in countries that are the most vulnerable and least well prepared to deal with climate change.\nAnd, while higher prices might be a challenge for consumers, they may pose an even bigger threat to farmers.\nJon Walker, Fairtrade’s senior advisor for cocoa, says: ‘While high prices may seem like a windfall for farmers, once they eventually filter through to the farmgate, the underlying causes are worrying.\n‘Higher prices offset by lower productivity simply perpetuates the income insecurity that keeps farmers trapped in poverty and threatens the future of cocoa.’\nMr Walker adds: ‘It remains to be seen if supply will bounce back, or whether the current trend will be longer-lasting.’\nRead more",
