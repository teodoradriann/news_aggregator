    "text": "2024-03-07 17:09:16\nA new martyr for the Islamic resistance in Lebanon rises in southern Lebanon on the road to Jerusalem.\n-\nThe martyr, the Mujahid on the road to Jerusalem, Fadi Mahmoud Dhawi (War Media of the Islamic Resistance)\nToday, Thursday, the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon – Hezbollah mourned the Mujahid Fadi Mahmoud Dhawi as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem. The military media statement stated that the martyr was born in 1976 and from the town of Aitaroun in southern Lebanon.\nBefore the resistance mourned its martyr, “Jihad,” it announced that it had targeted the “Radar” site in the occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms, and the “Ruwaisat Al-Alam” site in the occupied Lebanese Kfar Shuba hills, with missile weapons, confirming that it had achieved direct hits in the two Israeli sites.\nIn an air attack with two attack drones, the resistance claimed responsibility for targeting the “Maale Golan” barracks, and announced that its fighters were targeting the locations where the occupation soldiers were stationed in the “Al-Matula” settlement, killing and wounding its members.\nThe resistance indicated that the targeting of “Ma’ali Golan”, in addition to the targeting of “Al-Matula”, came in support of the steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, in support of their resistance, and in response to the Israeli attacks on southern villages and civilian homes, the latest of which was the aggression that targeted the southern town of Aitaroun.\nEarlier today, the resistance confirmed that it had targeted the “Afdoun” settlement, northern occupied Palestine, with “Katyusha” rockets, in support of Gaza and in response to the Israeli aggression on the town of Al-Dhaira, which led to the martyrdom of a citizen.\nRelated Articles: French Shift in Approach towards Lebanese Presidential File: Johnny Mounir discusses Franjieh's Declining Fortunes\nThe Islamic Resistance claimed responsibility for targeting a new headquarters for the Israeli military sector command in Liman with artillery shells, and announced that its mujahideen had targeted the Israeli “Zaoura” camp.\nIn the face of the ongoing resistance operations, the correspondent of the Israeli Channel 13 in northern occupied Palestine acknowledged that this front has witnessed an increase in the level of “Hezbollah attacks in recent days, whether with heavy weapons or using curved missiles or precision missiles, in addition to launching anti-armor missiles.” .\nThe reporter pointed out that Hezbollah is today using 180 and 220 mm missiles, and is trying to hit buildings with precision missiles.\nRead also: How do Hezbollah’s missile launches deplete Israel’s defense capabilities?\n1709873277\n#Islamic #resistance #Lebanon #marries #martyr #road #Jerusalem\nRelated posts:\n28 teams on deck!

    "text": "UNESCO on Thursday awarded its world press freedom prize to all Palestinian journalists covering the war in Gaza, where Israel has been battling Hamas for more than six months. “In these times of darkness and hopelessness, we wish to share a strong message of solidarity and recognition to those Palestinian journalists who are covering this crisis in such dramatic circumstances,” said Mauricio Weibel, chair of the international jury of media professionals. “As humanity, we have a huge debt to their courage and commitment to freedom of expression.” Audrey Azoulay, director general at the UN organisation for education, science and culture, said the prize paid “tribute to the courage of journalists facing difficult and dangerous circumstances”. According to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 97 members of the press have been killed since the war broke out in October, 92 of whom were Palestinians. The war started with Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel estimates that 129 captives seized by militants during their attack remain in Gaza. The military says 34 of them are dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 34,596 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.",

Fue el 7 de octubre de 2003, en el campo cántabro de El Malecón, cuando el Athletic perdió por 2-1 frente a la Gimnástica de Torrelavega en la temporada del debut de Ernesto Valverde.\nDesde entonces, el conjunto bilbaíno no había sido eliminado en cruce directo en estos 20 años en los que se había medido a un rival de sexta categoría, ocho de cuarta, seis de tercera, tres de segunda y ocho de primera.

WE’VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE THAT’S MAKING IT FEEL MORE LIKE 24. SO A BONA FIDE CHILLY OUT THERE. AND WE LOOK AT CENTRAL IOWA RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN STILL SEE SOME OF THOSE SNOW SHOWERS THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT TO THE GROUND UP OFF NEAR IOWA FALLS AND WATERLOO, EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE STATE, THOUGH, IS WHERE THE MOST ABUNDANT MOISTURE SITS RIGHT NOW. SO AREAS LIKE OTTUMWA DOWNWARDS TOWARDS SHERIDAN AND EASTWARD TOWARDS DAVENPORT GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE PICKING UP SNOW AS WE HEAD IN TOWARDS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING, WINDS HAVE BEEN STRONGER TOO. THESE ARE SUSTAINED WINDS AROUND 15 TO 25MPH, SO IT’S A LITTLE BIT CHILLY OUT THERE AND YOUR WIND CHILLS ARE REFLECTING THAT DOWN TO 19 FOR CLARINDA, 20 FOR MASON CITY, GRINNELL COMING IN AT 24.

WHAT WE SEE WILL BE LIGHT AND WILL NOT ACCUMULATE. CAN’T SAY THE SAME THOUGH. FOR SOUTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE STATE. WE’LL GET THE TOTALS IN A SECOND HERE. STAYING OVERCAST THOUGH, INTO TOMORROW MORNING AND WE’RE KEEPING IT BREEZY OUT THERE. THOSE CLOUDS DEPART THOUGH, AND AS THEY DO, THOSE WINDS ARE GOING TO DIE DOWN A BIT. SO TOMORROW AFTERNOON LOOKS PRETTY BEAUTIFUL. IF YOU’VE GOT PLANS TO GO FOR A RUN OR JUST SPEND SOME TIME OUTSIDE, IT’S LOOKING NICE INTO SATURDAY. WINDS DIE DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND AS WE INTO THE AFTERNOON THEY’LL PICK BACK UP TO AROUND 20 TO 25MPH OR SO. AS FAR AS HOW MUCH SNOW YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE, THOUGH, 1 TO 3IN FOR THOSE FAR SOUTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE STATE, A TRACE TO AN INCH AS WE GET WESTWARD FROM THERE. OSKALOOSA IN ON THAT.

WE’RE BACK UP TO 42 TOMORROW MORNING OR TOMORROW MORNING. IT’LL BE NICE MORNING TEMPERATURE TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WE’LL SEE THOSE CLOUDS DECREASE WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AS WE TAP INTO SOME OF THAT AFTERNOON SUN. AND WE’LL SEE MORE SUNSHINE FOR YOUR SATURDAY. THAT TEMPERATURE FOR SATURDAY AT 41. THEN A WEAK SYSTEM ROLLS THROUGH. NOT GOING TO KICK OUT ANY PRECIPITATION, BUT IT WILL KNOCK THAT TEMPERATURE DOWN. WE’RE TO 32 FOR YOUR SUNDAY WITH BREEZY CONDITIONS AND WE KEEP IT COLDER INTO THE NEW YEAR. 34 FOR YOUR START TO YOUR WEEK ON MONDAY. AFTER THAT, TEMPERATURES HOVERING IN THE MIDDLE 30S. SO EVEN THOUGH WE’RE COOLING DOWN, WE’RE STILL STAYING ABOVE AVERAGE. WE’VE GOT ONE DAY WHERE WE HIT AVERAGE. AFTER THAT, WE’RE BACK UP CLOSE TO 40 ON TUESDAY.
