    "text": "See the massive rogue wave in California that swept away a pickup truck Forecasters are warning of an \"exceptionally dangerous\" wave event along the California coast that \"has not occurred in many years\" — and in Ventura on Thursday, beachgoers experienced just how dangerous it can be. Video shows a massive rogue wave slamming into a the sea wall along the beach, sweeping up a truck and sending numerous people to the hospital. [Video of the moment](https://www.facebook.com/venturacountyfire/videos/7160040244059522?ftag=YHF4eb9d17) shows a crowd standing in a parking lot near the ocean before quickly scrambling to try to outrun the incoming wave, which was so large that it swept up a truck and several people, carrying them through rushing waters. It happened in Ventura, a coastal city roughly an hour northwest of Los Angeles. Ventura County Fire Department shared the footage, saying the \"rogue wave\" hit the beach at the end of Seward Avenue during a high surf advisory at high tide. The county has seen such high surf that streets were flooded with debris several blocks inland. \"Because of this wave eight people were transported to local hospitals,\" the fire department said, adding that [Ventura County beaches](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/high-surf-hits-southern-california-coast-some-areas-to-see-15-to-20-foot-sets/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17) and the pier are closed. \"For your safety, please avoid the area near the ocean, as it can be quite dangerous.\" The [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/lox/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17) is warning that coastlines from Southern to Central California are at \"extreme risk\" — the highest of its warning levels — of \"dangerous surf, life-threatening rip currents and coastal flooding\" through the weekend. Rio Del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded. Please avoid the area.

Ventura County could see waves between 10 and 15 feet, while Santa Barbara and Los Angeles County could see waves between 7 and 12 feet, with some sets reaching 15 to 20 feet in some locations. \"This is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years,\" the weather service said. \"Take caution and heed the direction of local authorities and lifeguards.\" The agency has warned people in these areas to stay out of the water, prepare for \"significant\" flooding and to avoid rocks and jetties near the water. \"Be wary of sneaker waves (suddenly much larger waves),\" the agency said. \"Never turn your back on the ocean.\" Northern California will also see its share of intense waves. The National Weather Service's San Francisco office said a coastal flood advisory is in effect through 2 p.m. on Friday, and a high surf warning was in effect until 6 a.m. Waves were predicted to break between 28 and 33 feet. \"Large waves can sweep across the each without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties and beaches,\" the agency warned. \"These large waves can be [erratic and unpredictable](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/TextProduct?product=afdmtr?ftag=YHF4eb9d17).\" [\"The Points Guy\" shares his top travel destinations for 2024](https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/the-points-guy-shares-his-top-travel-destinations-for-2024?ftag=YHFaf537c7) [Inventor of dental device backs off his claims after investigation of patient harms](https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/inventor-of-dental-device-backs-off-his-claims-after-investigation-of-patient-harms?ftag=YHFaf537c7) [Nikki Haley's Civil War comments spark reactions from GOP candidates](https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/nikki-haleys-civil-war-comment-spark-reactions-from-gop-candidates?ftag=YHFaf537c7)",

    "text": "Biden awards $1.7 billion to boost electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly in 8 states\nThe Biden administration is awarding nearly $2 billion in grants to help restart or expand electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly sites in eight states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia\nWASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is awarding nearly $2 billion in grants to General Motors, Stellantis and other carmakers to help restart or expand\nelectric vehicle manufacturing and assembly sites in eight states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nThe Energy Department will issue grants totaling $1.7 billion to create or retain thousands of union jobs and support auto-based communities that have long driven the U.S. economy, the White House said Thursday. Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.\nThe grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said.\n“Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,'' President\nJoe Biden said in a statement. “This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more — from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia — by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.''\nGM said Thursday that its $500 million federal grant will help the company convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM has already announced over $12 billion in investments in its North American EV manufacturing and supply chain since 2020. That investment and the federal grant “underscore our commitment to U.S. leadership in manufacturing and innovation,″ said Camilo Ballesty, GM vice president of North America Manufacturing and Labor Relations.\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark\n2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,'' the Democratic president said.\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after\na disastrous debate performance last month. Biden, 81, has acknowledged his poor performance but has brushed it off as a \"bad night,'' even as many congressional Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to give him a full vote of confidence. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party, even after becoming the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\nThe grants announced Thursday come after a federal competition that included four times as many applicants as grant recipients, the Energy Department said. Officials declined to identify companies that unsuccessfully applied for grants, but said all projects that were awarded funding currently employ Americans working in union jobs in the U.S.\n“There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,'' said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the federal grants will help “ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive — and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,” Granholm said.\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n“The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n“Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit — that iconic yellow school bus going green — but we’re also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Stellantis, whose brands include Fiat, Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge, will receive a total of $585 million, including nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\nStellantis has pledged to build a new $3.2 billion battery plant in Illinois.\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania, to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks. The plants are located in Macungie, Pennsylvania; Dublin, Virginia; and Hagerstown, Maryland.",

    "title": "Star Wars Outlaws : La nouvelle mise à jour apporte un changement de taille à cette fonctionnalité très controversée - Millenium",
    "text": "Alors qu’Ubisoft comptait énormément sur Star Wars Outlaws pour revenir sur le devant de la scène, le jeu n’a pas eu le succès espéré. Heureusement, l’équipe de développement continue de le mettre à jour, et la toute dernière corrige un des défauts les plus importants du jeu.\nVoilà quelques années maintenant que le studio français Ubisoft enchaîne les déceptions. Après un Skull and Bones très en dessous des promesses et un Avatar : Frontiers of Pandora un poil décevant selon certains joueurs, tout le monde avait le regard tourné vers Star Wars Outlaws jusqu’à sa sortie à la fin du mois d’août dernier. Avec une licence pareille, Ubisoft comptait bien en profiter pour reprendre du poil de la bête avant l’arrivée de Assassin’s Creed Shadows . Seulement voilà, le jeu n’a pas vraiment convaincu assez de monde à sa sortie. Résultat, les chiffres de ventes étaient très décevants pour l’entreprise, ce qui a poussé ses dirigeants à prendre des décisions drastiques concernant les futurs jeux. Heureusement cependant, ils n’ont pas abandonné le projet Star Wars Outlaws.\nStar Wars Outlaws continue de se mettre à jour Suite aux ventes très décevantes de Star Wars Outlaws , on aurait pu croire que le jeu serait rapidement mis aux oubliettes par Ubisoft. Pourtant, c’est tout l’inverse qui a été fait depuis sa sortie. En effet, le studio Massive Entertainment s’est retroussé les manches pour apporter plusieurs mises à jour améliorant plusieurs points différents. Ainsi, on a par exemple eu droit à des corrections de nombreux bugs, mais également à quelques modifications de game design pour rendre le jeu plus agréable à jouer.\nUn peu après la sortie de Star Wars Outlaws, afin de rassurer les joueurs déçus, les développeurs avaient publié une roadmap pour clarifier les travaux entamés. Ainsi, on pouvait apprendre que trois mises à jour majeures étaient prévues respectivement pour le 3 octobre , le 24 octobre et le 21 novembre . Les deux premières étant passées depuis un petit moment, il était enfin temps d’accueillir la troisième, et autant dire qu’elle était attendue.\nLa nouvelle mise à jour de Star Wars Outlaws devrait être très appréciée Depuis le 21 novembre dernier, il est enfin possible de jouer à Star Wars Outlaws en passant par Steam sur PC. Cela peut paraître anecdotique pour certains, mais les jeux Ubisoft avaient jusqu’à présent pour habitude de n’être jouables que sur le launcher d’Ubisoft pendant plusieurs années. Avec Star Wars Outlaws, l’éditeur entame une nouvelle façon de voir les choses qui sera également appliquée à Assassin’s Creed Shadows dès le jour de sa sortie. Mais la vraie nouveauté du 21 novembre dernier, c’était surtout la grosse mise à jour du jeu.\nEn plus de corriger toute une liste de bugs, cette dernière se concentrait surtout sur l’amélioration de quelques éléments très frustrants pour beaucoup de joueurs : les phases de furtivité . Absolument centrales tout au long du jeu, ces dernières n’étaient pas toujours très agréables à jouer, et Massive Entertainment vient de changer beaucoup de choses pour corriger ce défaut. Parmi les nouveautés, on note surtout qu’ il sera désormais possible de passer à l’attaque quand vous vous ferez repérer , plutôt que de subir un échec de mission. De plus, l’IA adverse a été améliorée et les notifications de détection devraient être plus claires.\nEt puis qu’il sera désormais possible de se battre une fois repéré, Massive Entertainment a également apporté quelques nouveautés au système de combat de Star Wars Outlaws. Par exemple, les ennemis ont désormais un point faible qu’il est possible d’exploiter pour créer des explosions ou de nouveaux effets. Kay est également capable de porter des armes à deux mains dans davantage de situations. Vous l’aurez compris, la mise à jour 1.4.0 apporte de grosses nouveautés à Star Wars Outlaws . Si vous l’aviez laissé de côté, il serait peut-être enfin temps de le terminer.\nStar Wars Outlaws peut-il suivre les pas de No Man's Sky ? Ubisoft tente le tout pour le tout Dans l'ensemble, Star Wars Outlaws a connu un succès raisonnable, mais les critiques des joueurs ont été nombreuses. Avec des mises à jour au programme, Ubisoft vise à perfectionner ces fonctionnalités peu appréciées des joueurs !",

    "text": "STATELINE, Nev. – This isn’t Santa Barbara resident Saul’s first celebrity golf tournament and has the autograph savvy to show for it. He has his method down to a tee, well pin flag. The opportunity to get up close and personal with world famous celebrities doesn’t present itself every day and the ability to do so at the American Century Championship is a huge draw for many. For five days each year at the Edgewood Tahoe golf course, fans have the opportunity to walk the same course as about 90 celebrities and watch them play. Most celebrities take the time to interact with fans as they walk or cart from one hole to the next tee. While fans at celebrity golf typically request autographs on hats, shirts, photos, or cards representing the celebrities they want to sign, Saul commemorates each tournament year by blending golf tournament traditions with the celebrity twist. It’s commonplace at professional golf tournaments to have pin flags autographed. Some tournaments have their own unspoken rules that along go with it. At the Masters Tournament, it’s rumored only the flag year’s champion can sign the middle. Saul started buying the Edgewood pin flags his second year of the ACC. He tapes the flag to a piece of cardboard and gets signatures from all his favorite celebrities. “At my house,” Saul says, “I literally have them stacked up on the wall.” This is now his fourth year attending and will take home his third flag. “All this is personal for me,” he explains it’s not a business. He says, unfortunately some people get autographs in order to resell them and he believes that’s why he finds some players reluctant to sign. For him, the signatures are priceless. “Everything I have ever gotten here, everything that I’ve ever had signed in my life is sitting on a wall in my house.” His flag was quickly filling towards the end of opening day with signatures from Davante Adams, Trevor Lawrence, and Adam Thielen to name a few, but he’s reserving the last few spots for Aaron Rodgers, Albert Pujols and Alex Rodriguez See more Support Local Journalism Support Local Journalism Readers around the Lake Tahoe Basin and beyond make the Tahoe Tribune's work possible.

    "title": "Robinhood Stock (NASDAQ:HOOD): Gold Card, Market Boom Could Be a Boon - TipRanks.com",
    "text": "Robinhood Markets ( [NASDAQ:HOOD](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hood)) stock [seems to have finally awoken](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hood/stock-charts), with shares now up more than 139% from their November 2023 low. [With a new gold credit card](https://www.tipranks.com/news/robinhood-nasdaqhood-diversifies-unveils-credit-card) (yes, it’s real 10-karat gold) shining a bright light back on the firm and its new growth prospects, perhaps it’s time investors give the meme stock kingpin a second look as the market rally brings stocks to new highs. Undoubtedly, Robinhood is starting to show us all that it’s more than just a controversial gamified trading platform that helped fuel the meteoric rise of meme stocks back in 2021. As the company pushes further into the financial technology services waters by adding perks to its Robinhood Gold membership, the firm may just be able to make the most of the latest stock market frenzy. After a glorious 2023 market rebound from the rough patch of 2022, the retail investor finally looks like it’s willing to jump back into the equity (and options) waters with both feet. And though things are different this time around, with generative artificial intelligence (AI) stocks sparking a hint of investor euphoria, one can’t help but notice some of the similarities to the 2021 boom in stocks. In any case, I’m inclined to turn bullish on HOOD stock as it looks to make the most of the latest stock, crypto, and gold market rally. The Latest Stock and Crypto Market Boom Bodes Well for Robinhood [Cryptocurrencies](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) are roaring higher again, with Bitcoin ( [BTC-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd)) blasting off to new heights. And there’s no shortage of insane action in red-hot issues like Trump Media & Technology Group ( [NASDAQ:DJT](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt)). Though only time will tell if meme stock activity will pick up where it left off a few years ago, I think that Robinhood has a golden opportunity (please forgive the pun) to cash in on the renewed speculative nature of young investors that may have a growing hunger for quick gains. Indeed, many folks may have learned some tough lessons back in 2021. Betting big on high-flying momentum and meme stocks does not tend to end well for most retail investors. And though Robinhood may have left a bitter taste in the mouths of investors during the great Gamestop ( [NYSE:GME](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gme)) boom of 2021, I believe that most have since forgotten or even forgiven the company. Indeed, three years of flying under the radar (and hibernating after an 86% plunge) will do that. Also, things seem different this time around (a dangerous saying in the investment world), depending on who you ask. Undoubtedly, OpenAI’s ChatGPT seems to have started an AI revolution. The technology may very well evolve to become more impactful than the internet itself. As the generative AI frenzy continues in 2024, it’s tough to simply sit out on the sidelines while other retail investors around you clock in some enviable gains in stocks like Nvidia ( [NASDAQ:NVDA](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda)). In short, the circumstances are different this time around, but as Mark Twain once put it, “History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme.” Another Golden Opportunity for Robinhood May be Looming Robinhood’s gold credit card is sure to draw in many applicants while feeding the pursuit of even greater riches. Though made of real gold, you’ll need to successfully refer 10 people to earn the card, which I think has no business being swiped, let alone leaving the comfort of a safety deposit box. Undoubtedly, it’s pretty hard to successfully refer a single person for a credit card, let alone 10, making the card pretty exclusive and probably not worth the considerable effort needed to fulfill the requirements of getting one. The gold credit card isn’t just an attention grabber for its beauty; it’s also riding on the back of a boom in the shiny yellow metal. Gold prices have been soaring of late, with prices currently sitting at all-time highs (just over $2,370/oz). Arguably, Robinhood seems even better positioned than back in mid-to-late 2020 as the AI trade, crypto boom, and precious metal pop looks to mint more millionaires from left, right, and center. The craze may also be nudging a new generation of young retail investors to get started in the investing waters for the very first time. Indeed, Robinhood makes it all too easy to get started. This may be more of a double-edged sword, given the allure and pitfalls of options trading. For beginner investors, it can be tempting to overreach for potential rewards without a clear understanding of one’s personal tolerance for risk. In any case, I expect Robinhood will be ready to meet the needs of young market participants, whether they intend to invest, trade, speculate, or just gamble. Further, the company is bolstering its gold membership with intriguing new perks, like 5% interest on uninvested brokerage cash and, of course, access to the Robinhood gold credit card, which offers 3% cash back on everything. These are great perks for a brokerage, but they don’t really mean much to inexperienced traders who will just blow it all on a rash [options](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hood/options-chain) trade in pursuit of quick riches. Is HOOD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? On TipRanks, HOOD stock comes in as a Hold. Out of 15 analyst ratings, there are four Buys, eight Holds, and three Sell recommendations. The [average HOOD stock price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hood/forecast) is $18.94, implying downside potential of 3.05%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $12.00 per share to a high of $30.00 per share. The Bottom Line on HOOD Stock The Robinhood gold credit card doesn’t just look good; it is objectively a pretty good card when it comes to simplicity and return on one’s expenditures. It will be interesting to see if the card, in combination with stock market momentum, draws a significant amount of customers into the Robinhood ecosystem, even if most of them intend to speculate rather than invest for the long term. Either way, I find the firm well-positioned to benefit from the latest stock and crypto market frenzy. The longer it lasts, the more runway Robinhood will have in its latest bid to attract new members.",
