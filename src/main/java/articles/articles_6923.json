C’est une véritable bombe à retardement pour les habitations » , a témoigné auprès de l’AFPTV Zulli Cabanillas, un habitant du quartier qui a dû quitter son logement.\nMario Casaretto, en charge de la gestion du sinistre pour la municipalité, a fait état lors d’une conférence de presse de « onze familles sinistrées » .\nM.

He's concerned me for 40 years. He's not a decent man,\" Biden, 81, told ABC News anchor David Muir during an interview in France at the Normandy American Cemetery to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day. \"He's a dictator, and he's struggling to make sure he holds his country together while still keeping this assault going,\" Biden added. \"We're not talking about giving them weapons to strike Moscow, to strike the Kremlin, to strike against — just across the border, where they're receiving significant fire from conventional weapons used by the Russians to go into Ukraine to kill Ukrainians.\" Putin, who has been in power since 2000, worked as a KGB agent from 1975-91. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. Biden was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972. © 2024 Newsmax. ",

    "text": "New lock feature for EBT cards, app announced for Georgia SNAP recipients\nATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Georgians who rely on the state’s food stamp program will now have an extra layer of security, the Georgia Department of Human Services (DHS) announced Thursday.\nDHS said a new feature allows EBT cardholders to easily lock and unlock their cards between purchases. Recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits can access the locking feature through the [existing ConnectEBT website](https://www.connectebt.com/ebtconnect/recipient/GA/) or by using a new ConnectEBT app.\nGeorgia is one of 14 states to offer the new app and one of several to include the card-locking feature, DHS said.\nThe lock feature lets customers choose where their cards are locked – either everywhere (including Georgia) or only outside Georgia. Customers can also use the ConnectEBT app to automatically lock their cards after a specific amount of time.\nCustomers can download the ConnectEBT app on their Android or Apple device from their device’s app store. Once the app is installed, customers can register a new account or log in using their ConnectEBT website username and password.\nFor more information or help with the ConnectEBT app or website, customers can call the customer service line at 1-888-421-3281.\n[Atlanta News First recently reported](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/10/23/skimming-hack-targeting-georgia-food-stamp-recipients-state-agency-says/) that DHS has been dealing with thousands of reports of stolen EBT funds dating back to 2023. The department said the fraud is believed to be tied to card skimming and cloning, resulting in nearly $3 million in replacement food stamps.\nCopyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) extended its recovery for the second straight session on Thursday after shedding 7,923 points in previous sessions, with the benchmark KSE-100 Index gaining 1,188.61 points (+1.95 percent) to close at 62,052.23 points. The market opened on a positive note and remained in the green territory throughout the session, albeit, some profit-taking was witnessed in the last 90 minutes trading. The bulls regained their dominance two days after an all-out rout when the benchmark of representative shares recorded its biggest day-on-day decline. On Wednesday, the stocks regained some of the lost ground amid value-hunting by investors. According to experts, value hunters were in action leading to across the board buying. Moreover, fresh liquidity is being injected as the market enters a new month, they said. They attributed the bullish momentum to “adequate amount of futures positions being rolled over.” They said that the market bounced back sharply during the last two sessions after a correction. They noted that market participants are expecting interest rates to decline in 2024, coupled with a broad-based re-rating of the market. “More than 125 stocks are trading 70pc below the May 2017 market cap in dollar terms. There is a significant valuation gap between Pakistan and other markets and that should keep foreign investors active,” they added. The benchmark index traded in a range of 1,658.5 points, showing an intraday high of 62,750.77 points and an intraday low of 61,092.27 points. Among other indices, the KSE All Share Index gained 883.39 points (+2.13 percent) to close at 41,568.01 points. Similarly, the KMI All Share Islamic Index gained 658.86 points (+2.17 percent) to close at 30,325.24 points. Total volumes traded for the KSE-100 Index decreased by 15.70mn shares to 378.62mn shares against 394.32mn traded in the previous session. However, the overall market volumes increased by 6.88 million shares to 676.24mn shares against 669.36mn shares traded a session earlier. Among scrips, KEL topped the volumes with 62.89mn shares, followed by WTL (46.19mn) and FFL (43.05mn). Stocks that contributed significantly to the volumes included KEL, WTL, FFL, AKBL,and CNERGY, which formed over 34 percent of total volumes. A total of 377 companies traded shares in the stock exchange against 355 in the previous session, out of which shares of 282 closed up, shares of 79 companies closed down while shares of 16 companies remained unchanged. A total of 98 companies traded shares in the KSE-100 Index against 96 in the previous session, out of which share prices of 83 companies closed up, 14 companies closed down and one remained unchanged. The number of total trades increased to 232,377 from 213,260 in the previous session, while the value traded increased by Rs. 4.16bn to Rs. 20.28 against Rs. 16.12bn in the previous session. In terms of rupee, UPFL remained the top gainer with an increase of Rs. 999 (+4.76 pe rcent) per share, closing at Rs. 21,999.

    "text": "An American woman freed after being held\n[hostage](/tag/hostage/) in Gaza and the families of two men killed in the Oct. 7 attack in Israel sued Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, which they accused of providing a funding mechanism for Hamas.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court Thursday, also named Iran and Syria and is the first of what could be a torrent of lawsuits over the Hamas attack against Israel that left at least 1,200 Israelis dead, according to Israeli officials.\nAmong the plaintiffs are members of the Raanan family. Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie, were kidnapped and held in Gaza before they were freed in a prisoner exchange in October. Other plaintiffs include the family and estate of Itay Glisko, the 20-year-old New Jersey native and IDF sergeant killed in action during the attack by Hamas.\nMORE |\n[Family of American hostages freed by Hamas speak out: 'It is not the end'](/judith-raanan-natalie-israel-hamas/13958264/)\nThe lawsuit accused Binance of processing numerous transactions for Hamas between 2017 and 2023, \"providing a clandestine financing tool that Binance deliberately hid from U.S. regulators.\"\nBinance did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\nThe company and its former CEO Chengpeng Zhao pled guilty last year to violations of U.S. anti-money laundering laws while agreeing to pay more than $4 billion in fines.\nThe violations included processing and failing to report \"transactions with cryptocurrency wallets that Binance senior executives had knowledge were linked to terrorist groups such as Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad,\" according to a Department of Justice filing.\nMORE |\n[24 hostages released from Gaza, 39 Palestinian prisoners swapped after temporary ceasefire deal](/what-time-will-the-hostages-be-released-ceasefire-israel-hamas/14099356/)\nZhao agreed to resign as part of his plea deal and will be sentenced in February where he faces up to 18 months in prison. The company also agreed to enter in a number of anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs and retain an independent monitor for the next three years.\n\"For years, Binance remained willfully blind to the use of its platform by illicit actors, including terrorists, by failing to do any due diligence on the vast majority of its users prior to August 2021,\" the lawsuit said.\nThe lawsuit added, \"Incredibly, Binance went out of its way to protect users associated with Hamas and other terrorist groups from regulatory scrutiny, especially if they were 'VIP users who generated huge profits for Binance.\"\nMORE |\n[Families of hostages held in Gaza storm Israel's parliament meeting demanding deal for release](/israel-hostages-parliament-hamas/14349885/)\nThe lawsuit, modeled on suits that emerged after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, accused Binance of aiding terror organizations, providing material support to terrorists and sought unspecified damages.\n\"This needs to be done. These crypto funds are turning a blind eye to all of this illegal activity and now it's actually facilitating terrorism,\" said plaintiff's attorney Rob Seiden. \"We're doing this to send a message to these crypto institutions: you can't do this stuff. You have to be more vigilant.\"\nMore than 100 hostages are thought to still be detained in Gaza, according to Israeli officials. Israel's military response to the Oct. 7 attack has killed at least 27,019 people in the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza's Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health.",

    "text": "MADRID:\nAntoine Griezmann and Rodrigo Riquelme's extra-time strikes earned Atletico Madrid a 4-2 win over rivals Real Madrid and passage to the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Thursday.\nEarlier Barcelona secured an unconvincing 3-1 win at third-tier Unionistas de Salamanca to scrape through their last 16 tie.\nAtletico edged an entertaining battle at the Rojiblancos' Metropolitano stadium, the second of three Madrid derbies in under a month, to inflict Los Blancos second defeat of the season in all competitions.\nMadrid twice pegged back Atletico to take the game to extra-time, with Jan Oblak's own goal cancelling out Samuel Lino's opener, and Joselu netting late on after Morata had put the hosts in front again.\nIn extra-time Griezmann broke down the right and finished with aplomb with Riquelme striking at the death to settle the game and avenge Atletico's 5-3 defeat by Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup semi-final last week.\n\"The games lately have been really nice for fans, at high speed, decided in extra-time and today it was our turn to win it,\" Atletico skipper Koke told TVE.\nOnce again, the match flowed end-to-end. Jude Bellingham hit the crossbar for Madrid before Atletico took the lead when Lino finished from close range.\nHowever the Spanish Super Cup winners levelled before the break when Luka Modric's crossed free-kick drew Oblak out of his goal.\nThe Slovenian, leaping to reach the ball but unable to grab it, ended up getting the final touch as it span into his own net.\nReal Madrid winger Vinicius Junior celebrated the equaliser more fiercely than anyone, with no love lost between the Brazilian and Atletico's supporters.\nThe home fans were jubilant early in the second half when Morata sent Atletico back ahead, after Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin failed to gather the ball, and it fell invitingly into the striker's path.\nReal Madrid hit the woodwork a second time through Rodrygo before Joselu equalised with 10 minutes to go.\nAfter Vinicius slipped in Bellingham, the England international cleverly sliced the ball across for the target man to nod home and send the match to extra-time.\nGriezmann cut through a tense first additional period with a brilliant solo run down the right wing, escaping Vinicius and finishing lethally across Lunin into the top corner to send Atletico ahead.\nSubstitute Dani Ceballos levelled for Madrid in the 111th minute but the goal was ruled out for offside, with Riquelme tucking home to settle the match.\nVictory meant a lot to Atletico, off the pace in La Liga and hurt by the prior Madrid defeat, and they celebrated wildly with their fans.\nMadrid's only two defeats this season have come at the hands of Atletico.\nAfter Alvaro Gomez brilliantly volleyed Unionistas in front, Spanish champions Barcelona clawed their way back to triumph with goals from Ferran Torres, Jules Kounde and Alejandro Balde.\nThe hosts, at their packed 6,000 capacity Reina Sofia stadium, were fired up and dreaming of an upset after already knocking out Villarreal.\nUnionistas struck first to shock Barcelona. Juan Serrano crossed to the back post and the unmarked Gomez superbly hammered home on the volley after 31 minutes.\nBarca equalised before the break when Torres broke free on the counter, running through one-on-one from the halfway line, and kept his cool to finish well.\nXavi cut a frustrated figure until Kounde put Barcelona ahead with a bolt from the blue in the 69th minute, after being given too much time 25 yards out.\nBalde made amends for his poor marking for the Unionistas goal by netting Barcelona's third, a superb solo strike.",

    "text": "BOISE, Idaho — Multiple sheriff's offices are sounding the alarm and warning the public after receiving reports of recent phone scams. The Bonneville County Sheriff's Office and the Elmore Sheriff's Office said scammers are faking their numbers to mimic the sheriff's office's number. They are posing as a deputy or officer by using their names and demanding money to cover a fake warrant or court date fee. \"The suspects offer up enough accurate information about our area and portray themselves in a convincing way to make the would-be victim believe they will be arrested if they fail to act or return their call,\" Bonneville sheriff's said. Scammers then create a fake sense of urgency and demand gift cards as payments. [Gift cards](/article/news/local/ftc-joins-idaho-agencies-share-stories-behind-rising-consumer-scams/277-670b106b-3303-47a4-acfd-a7788e97f58c) are a common way scammers steal money from their victims, as once they are redeemed, the money cannot be recovered. The Bonneville Sheriff's said if you believe a scammer is calling you, you should hang up immediately and call law enforcement. Also, if you have been the victim of a scam, call them immediately. In Elmore County, the sheriff's office said if a scammer has contacted you, call them immediately, as your tip can help their investigation. \"If you believe you are being scammed in some manner, it’s always a good idea to monitor your financial accounts, update passwords, and enable security verifications for your online accounts to make sure your information is as safe as possible,\" Bonneville sheriff's said.",
