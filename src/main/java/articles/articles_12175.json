    "title": "Pep Guardiola relieved to finish ‘intense month’ with win over Sheffield United | Reading Chronicle",
    "text": "Pep Guardiola played down the significance of his side’s victory over Sheffield United on Saturday despite it increasing the pressure at the top of the Premier League. Goals from Rodri and Julian Alvarez at the Etihad Stadium saw the champions wrap up a memorable 2023 – a year in which they won five trophies – with a comfortable 2-0 victory over the struggling Blades. The result lifted City within two points of leaders Liverpool at the end of a draining month in which they played nine matches, including two in Saudi Arabia at the Club World Cup. That could be viewed as ominous for the rest of the competition but City manager Guardiola did not want to be drawn into such talk. Guardiola said: “What we have done in the past doesn’t mean it is going to happen in the future. The future is happy New Year and three days off, and after that it is Huddersfield. No further than that. “Except for two or three games, we were better than the opponents and could not get the results we deserved – but it is business and you have to win games. “Today we did it and I’m really pleased for the guys. It was an intense month.” Guardiola felt City were initially below their best but was pleased with the way they roused themselves. He said: “The first half was a little bit flat. The body language of the players – they didn’t communicate, didn’t talk, didn’t laugh, didn’t shout. “It was ‘OK, I have to play a football game’, but football games cannot be played in that way. “At half-time, for the first time, I didn’t talk one word about tactics. I took a chair and sat and said, ‘Guys go out with a smile on your face and with another rhythm in terms of enjoying what you’re doing. We are not going to do what happened against Crystal Palace’.” “In the second half, the first 15 minutes were the best minutes that we did.” Guardiola also hailed an “incredible effort” from Jack Grealish, who started for City after a difficult few days following a burglary at his house. Defeat left Sheffield United bottom of the table but manager Chris Wilder found positives in the attitude of his players. He said: “It felt like we played football for about five hours. At the start, when you are walking out, and you see five trophies, it hits home to you and what you are up against. “We were light in terms of Premier League experience but what we weren’t light on is fight or character, and that has delighted me since I walked through the door. “It is incredibly difficult to come here, even for the top teams. We stuck at it and it was great experience for the young lads to learn. There is no downside from this game.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Schianto dell’elicottero in Canada, il padre di un sopravvissuto: “Tragedia che ricorderanno tutta la vita”\n\"Jakob si è rotto entrambe le gambe, ha perso litri di sangue, era sospeso tra la vita e la morte; eppure per tre ore ha tentato via radio di collegarsi con gli amici che erano sull’altro elicottero perché lo trovassero\". A raccontare gli istanti successivi allo\nschianto dell'elicottero avvenuto lunedì 22 gennaio a Terrace, in Canada, è il genitore di uno dei sopravvissuti al terribile incidente, intervistato dal Corriere della Sera.\n\"Mentre era gravemente ferito, accanto al fratello minore già morto e con un’altra vittima dall’altro lato, loro sorvolavano la zona disperati. Non è qualcosa che potranno mai dimenticare: è uno choc che si porteranno dietro per tutta la vita\", aggiunge.\nIl giovane di cui parla è Jakob Oberrauch, uno dei due figli del fondatore e amministratore delegato del gruppo Sportler, si trovava in Canada con altri giovani per fare eliskiing, quando il velivolo su cui viaggiava insieme ad alcuni di loro è precipitato a circa 700 chilometri a nord-ovest di Vancouver.\nNello schianto sono morti il fratello 29enne del sopravvissuto, Henizl e Andreas junior Widmann, 35 anni, insieme al pilota. Oltre a Jakob sono rimasti feriti anche Johannes Peer, 34enne cognato dei due fratelli e direttore finanziario del gruppo di articoli sportivi ed Emilio Zierock, 35enne della nota cantina vinicola Foradori.\n\"Ho appena chiuso il telefono con mio figlio: mi ha riferito che l’esercito tenterà di recuperare le salme in alta montagna — racconta ancora il padre di uno dei ragazzi sopravvissuti —. I corpi di Andreas e Heinzl sono ancora lì, dove è caduto l’elicottero. Il pilota è morto e pare che la guida non sopravviverà. Gli amici feriti, invece, dovrebbero farcela. Il 24 gennaio sono stati trasferiti in altri ospedali più grandi e specializzati e con ciascuno di loro c’era un amico. Johannes è già stato operato, Emilio veniva sottoposto a intervento chirurgico mentre mio figlio mi chiamava e Jakob verrà operato tra poche ore. Secondo i medici ce la faranno tutti\".\nGli altri amici dei ragazzi, che si trovavano su un altro mezzo, resteranno in Canada solo fino a quando sarà necessario. \"Oggi hanno preso parte a un meeting con l’esercito per agevolare le ricerche dei corpi — conferma il padre del sopravvissuto —. Sono tutti sotto choc. È ovvio che un ragazzo di trent’anni che muore in questo modo, mentre è in vacanza a divertirsi, è una tragedia immane; ma sopravvivere a tuo fratello senza poter fare nulla e avere davanti agli occhi l’orrore di quello che è successo e di quello che hai vissuto in prima persona non so se sia una tragedia minore. Essere stato presente e avere per sempre queste immagini negli occhi è la vera catastrofe\".",

    "text": "[Celebrity](/celebrity/)\nLee Chaeyeon Reveals Serious Health Condition Due to Dancing?\nSinger Lee Chae-yeon has revealed that her back is in poor condition.\nOn December 19, [Lee Chaeyeon](/tag/lee-chae-yeon/) posted a photo on her Instagram story with the caption, “Let’s go together… Friend, please take care of me.”\nThe shared photo displayed an image of her spine. It appeared that Lee Chaeyeon had visited a hospital after experiencing discomfort. The image showed the disc fluid between her fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) and the first sacral vertebra (S1) appearing noticeably thinner than that of other areas, with some fluid seemingly leaking out.\nLater, Lee Chaeyeon uploaded a video showcasing her dance practice, captioning it, “It’s amazing it hasn’t burst yet. You worked hard.”\nThis indirectly indicated that her intense dance routines may have caused her back issues.\nLee Chaeyeon gained fame in 2018 by participating in Mnet’s girl group survival audition program “Produce 48.” She was selected as one of the final 11 members and served as the main dancer and lead vocalist of the project girl group IZ*ONE until their disbandment in April 2021. After resuming life as a trainee, she re-debuted as a solo artist on October 12, 2022. Known for her powerful and refreshing dance skills, she earned the title of “Summer Queen.”\nIn response to this news, netizens and fans couldn’t hide their concern and offered advice for her to rest:\n- Oh no… The back is crucial; take care of it for life.\n- If your back gives out, there’s no solution. Please manage it while you can.\n- It’s impossible to not have issues when you use your body like that.\n- Take good care of your health; you can’t get hurt.\n- Is the dark area the ruptured disc where the arrow is pointing?\n- It’s hard to find an idol who dances well and doesn’t have back issues.\n- Rest well, focus on posture, and exercise. Dancers seem to sit cross-legged or slouch a lot in practice rooms, which worries me as a fellow disc sufferer.\nMeanwhile, [Chaeyeon recently gained significant attention for her strong reaction to the impeachment of the South Korean president](/because-im-a-celebrity-i-speak-out-lee-chaeyeon-vs-why-do-celebrities-have-to-speak-out-lim-young-woong-on-presidents-impeachment/), insisting on her responsibilities as a celebrity.",

    "text": "Generation Network»\nGeneration Professionals Group\nThe Generation Professionals Group is for utility professionals who work in biomass, coal, gas/oil, hydro, natural gas, or nuclear power generation fields.\nPost\nNew EIA Data Reveal the Mix of All Renewables Increased by Almost 10% and Provided Nearly a Quarter of U.S. Electrical Generation in 2024\n- Feb 27, 2025 1:51 pm GMT\nA review by the SUN DAY Campaign of data just released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) confirms that throughout 2024, solar remained the nation’s fastest growing source of electricity as the mix of all renewables increased their output by almost 10% and provided almost a quarter of the total.\nKey Year-to-Date (YTD) Trends for Solar:\nIn its latest monthly \"Electric Power Monthly\" report (with data through December 31, 2024), EIA says the combination of utility-scale and “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar increased by 26.9% in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nUtility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 32.0% while small-scale solar PV increased by 15.3%. Together, solar was nearly 7.0% (6.91%) of total U.S. electrical generation for the year.\nIn December alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar expanded by 42.0% compared to December 2023.\nSmall-scale solar (i.e., systems <1-MW) accounted for 27.9% of all solar generation and provided 1.9% of U.S. electricity supply in 2024.[1]\nIn fact, small-scale solar PV is now generating nearly twice as much electricity as utility-scale biomass as well as over five times more electricity than either utility-scale geothermal or the mix of petroleum liquids and coke.\nKey 2024 Milestones for the Mix of Renewables:\nThe electrical output of the nation’s wind farms in 2024 was 7.7% more than that of a year ago. Wind remains the largest source of electrical generation among renewable energy sources, accounting for 10.3% of the nation’s total.\nThe combination of wind and solar provided more than 17.2% of the nation’s electrical generation during 2024.\nThe mix of all renewables (i.e., wind and solar plus hydropower, biomass and geothermal) provided 24.2% of total U.S. electricity production in 2024 compared to 23.2% of electrical output a year earlier.\nBetween January and December, electrical generation by renewables grew by 9.6% compared to the same period the year before – nearly three times the growth rate of natural gas (3.3%) and over ten times that of nuclear power (0.9%).\nIn December alone, electrical generation by renewables grew by 10.1% compared to December 2023.\nOther Note-Worthy Developments:\nDuring 2024, wind out-produced hydropower by 87.2% while solar generation surpassed hydropower by 25.2%. [2]\nFurther, during the year, the combination of wind and solar produced 15.9% more electricity than did coal and came close to matching nuclear power’s share of total generation (17.2% vs. 17.8%).\nThe mix of renewables reinforced their position as the second largest source of electrical generation, behind only natural gas.\n# # # # # # # # #\nSource:\nEIA released its latest “Electric Power Monthly” report on February 26, 2025. The full report can be found at: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly\nFor the data cited in this release, see Table ES1.B (“Total Electric Power Industry Summary Statistics, Year-to-Date 2024 and 2023”) as well as Table ES1.A (“Total Electric Power Industry Summary Statistics, 2024 and 2023”)\nNotes:\n[1] In its “Electric Power Monthly” report, EIA refers to small-scale or distributed solar as “Estimated Small Scale Solar Photovoltaic.” Unless otherwise indicated, all calculations presented in this release include electrical generation by small-scale solar which EIA estimates to have totaled 84,630 gigawatthours (GWh) during 2024.\n[2] In 2024, wind produced 453,454 GWh (10.3%) of total U.S. electrical generation while utility-scale and small-scale solar combined produced 303,168 GWh (6.9%) and hydropower produced 242,226 GWh (5.5%).\n# # # # # # # # #\nThe SUN DAY Campaign is a non-profit research and educational organization founded in 1992 to support a rapid transition to 100% reliance on sustainable energy technologies as a cost-effective alternative to nuclear power and fossil fuels and as a solution to climate change.\n===========================================\nGet Published - Build a Following\nThe Energy Central Power Industry Network® is based on one core idea - power industry professionals helping each other and advancing the industry by sharing and learning from each other.\nIf you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

    "text": "Monaco revient de très loin. Dominés lors de leurs trois dernières sorties en Euroligue, les joueurs de Vassilis Spanoulis avaient une occasion en or de se relancer sur le parquet de la Virtus Bologne, équipe du bas de tableau. La « Roca Team » a pu y parvenir mais non sans être passée par toutes les émotions durant les 40 minutes de jeu. Avec Jaron Blossomgame (10 points, 5 rebonds) à la manœuvre, le club de la Principauté a fait la course en tête dans les premiers instants de la rencontre. Mais l’avantage de cinq points a immédiatement fondu dans un 7-0 emmené par Marco Belinelli (11 points) puis Alessandro Pajola (14 points) à longue distance. Les Bolognais ont alors fait la course en tête au tableau d’affichage jusqu’au terme du premier quart-temps.\nL’entame du deuxième a tourné au cauchemar pour les champions de France en titre. Muets en attaque pendant quasiment trois minutes, avec Mike James (24 points, 7 rebonds) qui a mis fin à ce trou noir, les Monégasques ont pris la foudre. En effet, la Virtus Bologne a pu s’appuyer sur Matthew Morgan (7 points) pour infliger un 13-0 à Monaco et prendre une marge de 21 points. A l’orgueil, les Monégasques ont remis le bleu de chauffe pour répliquer avec un 7-0, ne laissant pas les Transalpins s’envoler un peu plus au score.\nMonaco a su ne pas paniquer\nSans s’affoler, les coéquipiers de Donatas Motiejunas (11 points) ont progressivement réduit leur retard pour revenir à seulement six unités à 21 secondes du retour aux vestiaires. Un temps suffisant pour voir Tornike Shengelia (15 points, 5 rebonds) passer un dernier panier et offrir huit longueurs d’avance au club bolognais à la pause. Rayjon Tucker (10 points) a su relancer la machine pour la Virtus Bologne mais Petr Cornelie (5 points) et Georgios Papagiannis (11 points, 5 rebonds) avaient une autre idée en tête. Ils ont permis à Monaco de repasser sous les dix points de retard. Ce qui a perduré tout au long d’un troisième quart-temps qui a vu les deux équipes se rendre coup pour coup. C’est avec une différence de dix points que les Transalpins ont abordé les dix dernières minutes de cette rencontre. Un retard que la « Roca Team » a effacé très rapidement grâce à deux tirs primés signés Mike James en l’espace de 33 secondes. Si la Virtus Bologne a essayé de répliquer, ses joueurs ont pris un gros coup sur la tête et perdu le contrôle des opérations.\nPassant devant au score à un peu plus de deux minutes du buzzer, les Monégasques n’ont rien laissé passer dans une fin de match marquée par une succession de lancers francs. A ce petit jeu, Monaco l’emporte de six unités (80-86) et se remet dans le sens de la marche en Euroligue grâce à ce quatorzième succès en 23 matchs.",
