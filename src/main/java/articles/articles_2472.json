    "text": "In an Indian town known as a flashpoint for sectarian violence, workers are crafting the final touches on a divisive temple that has come to symbolise the country's rising tide of Hindu nationalism.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi will next month inaugurate Ayodhya's new shrine to Lord Ram on a site where a mosque once stood, before it was torn down by Hindu zealots more than three decades ago.\nMuslim residents of the city, remembering the deadly riots that accompanied the demolition, have been wary of its renewed atmosphere of religious fervour.\nBut for many more, the project is both a means of restoring Ayodhya to the glory of its depiction in ancient Hindu texts, and proof of Modi's commitment to defending India's majority faith just months ahead of national elections.\n\"Modi has stayed true to his promise,\" housewife Gudiya Devi told AFP outside another temple in Ayodhya after her morning prayers.\n\"All these years we dreamt of a majestic Ram temple and now that dream is coming true,\" she added. \"This is all thanks to Modi. He is our true leader.\"\nArtisans were toiling on top of bamboo scaffolds Friday to finish ornamental details on the main structure of the imposing shrine, which will stand 50 metres (160 feet) tall at its highest point.\nWith a price tag of an estimated 20 billion rupees ($240 million) according to project manager Jagdish Aphale, its builders expect tens of millions of Hindu pilgrims to visit the temple each year.\nImmense sums from government coffers have poured into Ayodhya to give the city's dilapidated infrastructure a facelift ahead of the inauguration.\nA new international airport will open on Saturday, road and rail connections have been upgraded and a crop of new hotels have sprung up almost overnight.\nSidewalks and pillars have been decorated with the saffron flags and marigold flowers used in Hindu festivities to welcome travellers.\n\"So many pilgrims have already started pouring into the city,\" said Shubh Mangal, a 52-year-old who makes his living selling flowers and other offerings for Hindu worshippers.\n\"My profits have doubled. We are all overjoyed.\"\n- 'Full of dread' -\nRam is one of the most revered deities in the Hindu pantheon as the protagonist of the Ramayana, one of the faith's two foundational epics, which chronicles his battles with the demon-king Ravana.\nDevout Hindus believe that Ram was born in Ayodhya around 7,000 years ago but that during the rule of the Mughal Empire, the Babri Masjid mosque was built on top of his birthplace in the 16th century.\nModi's presence at the inauguration is effectively the opening salvo in his campaign for re-election later in 2024.\nHis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has campaigned for decades to build a temple on the site and its activists were instrumental in the mosque's demolition.\nOne senior BJP leader travelled around the country to rally the faithful to the cause in a Toyota sedan fitted to resemble Ram's mythical chariot -- a procession that sparked multiple religious riots in its wake.\nThe mosque was torn down by a mob in 1992, triggering another wave of riots across the country that killed 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.\nIts destruction was a hammer blow to the foundations of India's secular political order, paving the way for the rise of Hindu nationalism to become the country's dominant political force.\nThe site lay dormant for decades before a Supreme Court decision in 2019 permitted construction of the Ram temple.\nHaji Mehboob, a witness for the losing side of that case, said Modi's presence at the temple's inauguration was another milestone in the increasing entanglement of Hindu worship and politics.\n\"The prime minister of a secular country is coming to inaugurate a Hindu temple... with an eye on winning the 2024 elections by reaching out to his Hindu base,\" he told AFP.\n\"The Muslim community in Ayodhya is full of dread over what the future holds for them.\"",

    "title": "3 Best NBA Bets and Player Props for Rockets at Kings",
    "text": "NBA\n3 Best NBA Bets and Player Props for Rockets at Kings\nEven within a single NBA game, betting markets are abundant.\nYou can bet traditional markets like the spread or the total, but we've also got tons of player-prop markets to sift through.\nWhich bets stand out today as the Houston Rockets face the Sacramento Kings?\nLet's dig into the best bets in FanDuel Sportsbook's NBA betting odds, utilizing FanDuel Research's NBA projections to try to find value.\nRockets at Kings Betting Picks\nRockets Moneyline (+152)\nI'm not one to advocate for a team that will be playing their second road game in as many days, but I'm also not one to pass up the opportunity to back the Houston Rockets (27-12) at +152 odds against a lesser Sacramento Kings (20-20) team.\nHouston comes in with a +6.2 net rating while Sacramento owns a +2.6 net rating. The Rockets actually have a better net rating on the road (+6.7) and tout a 13-6 record in that split. The Kings, meanwhile, have gone a rough 10-12 at home.\nThe Rockets check in with the third-best defensive rating in the league. The Kings have gone 4-7 against the top 9 defenses and struggle with a -30 point differential in this split.\nMoneyline\nThis young Houston group has gone an iffy 3-4 on the second leg of a back-to-back this season, but all of those drops were lost by six points or fewer and they own a +24 point differential in this split. I should note that three of those four losses came against strong and healthy competition, including the Minnesota Timberwolves, Milwaukee Bucks, and San Antonio Spurs.\nSacramento ranks 14th in defensive rating and 18th at home. The Rockets have gone a convincing 19-4 against teams that fare outside the top 11 on defense, including 8-1 on the road.\nSimply put, I don't think Houston should have just a 39.7% win chance (via +152 odds) against a non-powerhouse.\nJalen Green Under 23.5 Points (-106)\nJalen Green is on a heater of all heaters. He's averaging 32 points across his last six games and has gone a breathtaking 32-for-64 (50.0% 3P%) from distance in that span.\nI'm calling an end to that hot streak, and I don't think that takes away too much from betting Houston outright.\nOn the season, Green is averaging 21.3 points per game and has scored under 23.5 points at a 64.1% clip, up from the 51.5% probability on these -106 odds.\nMost telling is his output against fast-paced teams. The Kings operate at the 13th-quickest pace in the league and rank seventh in pace this month. Green, meanwhile, has scored under 23.5 points in a mammoth 80.0% of games (16 out of 20) versus top 15 pace clubs, whereas he averages 23.4 points outside this split.\nJalen Green - Points\nWhile it's intimidating to bet against Green given his recent play, the 64.1% hit rate on the under and the 80.0% hit rate in that relevant pace split are hard to deny.\nPlus, the Rockets have gone 17-8 in games where Green scored under 23.5 points, so the correlation between these two bets is weak enough for me to feel ok betting against Green while betting on Houston.\nKeegan Murray Over 10.5 Points (-125)\nKeegan Murray has cleared this prop in five straight games and could continue that trend tonight.\nOn the season, Murray is averaging 11.9 points. He's scored 10 points in 70.3% of games and has cracked over 10.5 points at a 59.5% rate, up from the 55.5% implied probability on these -125 odds.\nAs mentioned, the Rockets come in with the third-best defense in the league. Great opposing defenses have historically led to increased opportunities for the at times forgotten about Murray.\nMurray is averaging 12.1 points and has cleared 10.5 points in 66.7% of games versus top 12 defenses. He's eclipsed this prop at a 70.0% rate (7 out of 10 contests) against the top 9 defenses. That includes one 13-point outing against Houston earlier this season.\nKeegan Murray - Points\nOur NBA DFS projections expect Murray to score 13.8 points in this matchup. His defensive qualities (leads the team in defensive win shares) should keep him on the court down the stretch. Notably, Murray has been playing 38.3 minutes (third-most) across his last four, evidently winning favor with new interim head coach Doug Christie.\nGet a No Sweat Token to use on a 3+ leg SGP wager on either of the NBA on TNT games happening tonight, January 16th!

    "text": "Could a holiday pet have consequences? Officials urge caution\nDAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) -Employees at animal shelters in the Quad Cities said they usually see an increase in animal adoptions around the holiday season.\n“They need to consider that it is a life and there is a lot to consider in bringing a new life into your home,” QC Paws shelter supervisor Abby Isenberger said.\nBefore getting a pet, Isenberger said shelter workers ask families questions about financial and physical responsibility.\n“We hope that we ask the right questions and can get these animals into a home that they can stay forever,” Isenberger said.\nBut after the holidays are over, workers say they’ve seen pets returned to the shelter.\n“Couple months later people realize, you know, maybe, they’re not able to take care of the pet,\" Bryn Rea, an animal caretaker at King’s Harvest Pet Rescue said.\nFinancial Impact\nThe workers also said they’ve seen pets being returned to the shelter because people can’t afford to take care of them anymore.\n“With everything, just the prices of everything going up, it’s been really difficult.” Rea said.\nAccording to the\n[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https:// With everything. Just the prices of everything going up, it's been really difficult.), the cost of pets, pet products and services in the U.S. has gone up for consumers in the last year.\nCopyright 2024 KWQC.
