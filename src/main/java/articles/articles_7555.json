    "text": "WILTON — Mary Ryan was recognized Sunday, May 26, for the many ways she has contributed to her church and other area organizations. The Church Council of the First Congregational Church UCC recognized Ryan as a “Saint of the Church.” “While there’s no formal definition of a saint, you recognize one when you see one,” Donna Peare noted. “A saint is a person who goes above and beyond to serve our church.” Judy Upham said Ryan grew up in Wilton, went away to college, and taught biology for many years in Brookline, Massachusetts, before moving back to Wilton when her mother needed help as she aged. “I probably first met Mary on the tennis court,” Upham noted. “She is well known for her wicked forehand. She has been very instrumental in helping to keep the Academy Hill School tennis courts functional by helping to organize and oversee a popular tennis tournament to raise funds for maintenance.” Arline Amos remembers meeting Ryan in fourth grade when they outgrew primary schools and headed to Wilton Central Grammar School for the next five years. “We shared the same elementary teachers, Girl Scout leaders, recreational events, and most high school classes until graduation,” Amos said. “I remember sharing the same music instructors. Mary was one of the sharpest students and was happy to help others who might be struggling. “After graduation, we went our separate ways for college and careers; but both ended up in the teaching profession,” Amos noted. “After retirement we re-connected and began sharing activities, especially swimming at her lake property.” Ryan was the director of Everyone’s Resource Depot at the University of Maine at Farmington for most of its existence. The depot was founded when a group of people in 1979 liked the reuse concept offered by the Children’s Resource Center in Portland and decided it would be well worth developing something similar in Farmington, she noted when the depot turned 40 in 2019 . “Her efforts to reduce, reuse, recycle have been well received by the community,” Amos stated. “Many people donate reusable items to the depot. Much less waste to go to the landfills and teachers with limited, or no, budgets are able to purchase much-needed resources.” Ryan is one of the original members of Friends of Wilson Lake. For more than 35 years she was on the forefront of water quality testing on Wilson Lake . “Mary is passionate about keeping our beautiful lake clear and clean for all to enjoy,” Amos said. “She was instrumental in getting the boat inspection program started at the boat launch area so that milfoil could be detected and removed before getting to the lake. She has been a very strong supporter of the Foothills Land Conservancy at the head of the lake. She and her family have enjoyed many summers in their camp on the lake. She loves to swim to the point and back.” Ryan has used her greenhouse to grow many plants for the Tyngtown Club plant sale which helps that organization fund the downtown flower boxes, the library, and many other local endeavors. “Mary has been a lifelong member of this church,” Amos said. “She has taught us to reduce, reuse, and recycle. She has been the co-organizer of the chicken barbecue at the Wilton Blueberry Bazaar for many years. She became the organist in 1989 after Nancy Cureton retired.” “May 21st, 1989, I played for the last time and Mary took over the job,” Cureton noted. “She has been a faithful and totally reliable player since. Thank you Mary for helping to keep the tradition of someone raised in this church family participating in such a meaningful way.” Ryan spent about 35 years providing consistent, dedicated organ music for Sunday services, funerals, and other church-related programs, Upham said. “She decided to retire when she felt she could no longer provide the best music that the organ had to offer,” she added.

    "title": "Indian Govt Plans Its First Carbon Credits Sale",
    "text": "India is gearing up for its first carbon credit sale, with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) playing a crucial role. The government plans to leverage FCI's optimized logistics and digital transformation efforts, which have significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative is part of India's broader strategy to meet its emission reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.\nThe carbon credits generated from these efforts will be sold, providing a financial incentive for further sustainability initiatives. This move is expected to promote cleaner technologies and practices across various sectors.\nIndia's carbon credit trading scheme, established under the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022, aims to create a domestic carbon market. This market will incentivize emission reductions by allowing companies to trade carbon credits, thus encouraging them to adopt more sustainable practices.\nThe Food Corporation of India (FCI) is playing a pivotal role in the Indian government’s first carbon credit sale. By optimizing its logistics operations, FCI has significantly reduced its greenhouse gas emissions. This includes digital transformation initiatives that streamline supply chain operations, reduce transportation distances, and improve overall efficiency. The carbon credits generated from these emission reductions will be sold.\nIt’s a significant step towards achieving carbon neutrality and promoting sustainable practices in India’s foodgrain management system.\nTo optimize its logistics, focusing on improving efficiency and reducing emissions, FCI has adopted digital tools to streamline its supply chain operations. This includes real-time tracking of foodgrain movement, automated inventory management, and predictive analytics to forecast demand and optimize storage and distribution\nFurther, by optimizing routes and consolidating shipments, FCI has reduced fuel consumption and transportation costs. This not only lowers emissions but also ensures timely delivery of foodgrains.\nMoreover, FCI is incorporating sustainable practices such as using energy-efficient equipment and renewable energy sources in its operations. This further contributes to reducing the carbon footprint.\nBesides, the FCI is also working with various stakeholders, including state governments and private partners, to implement best practices in logistics and supply chain management. Additionally, it provides training to its staff on sustainable practices and efficient resource utilization.\nFCI maintains a vast network of storage facilities across the country, including warehouses and silos, to store the procured food grains.\nEstablished in 1965 under the Food Corporations Act, 1964, the FCI operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. FCI’s primary mandate is to ensure the food security of India by managing the procurement, storage, and distribution of food grains, primarily wheat and rice.\nIn April this year, the Indian government has significantly increased FCI’s authorized working capital to ₹21,000 crore from ₹10,000 crore. This financial boost is aimed at minimizing borrowings and interest payouts, and funding a planned modernization drive. The additional capital will help FCI enhance its storage facilities, improve transportation networks, and adopt advanced technologies.\nLater in July, the Union government has restructured FCI’s funding, allowing it to operate without taking on new debt for the first time. This move expected to cut interest payments by a tenth and smoothen the flow of funds, ensuring more efficient operations.\nNotably, the Indian government has several plans and initiatives related to carbon credit sales and the development of a domestic carbon market.\nLast year in June, the Ministry of Power has notified the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023, which aims to establish a domestic carbon market. This scheme sets the framework for trading carbon credits , with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) acting as the administrator and the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) overseeing the trading process.\nBesides, the country is also working towards launching a national carbon market to drive down fossil fuel use. This market will allow polluters to exchange credits equivalent to a certain amount of emissions, incentivizing companies to reduce their carbon footprint",

    "text": "L’Autoritat Saudita de Dades i intel·ligència artificial (SDAIA) ha signat un Memoràndum d’Enteniment (MoU) amb l’Organització per a la Cooperació i el Desenvolupament Econòmic (OCDE) amb l’objectiu de reforçar la supervisió d’incidents d’intel·ligència artificial (IA) als països de l’Orient Mitjà i millorar el seguiment dels avenços de la IA mitjançant el Monitor d’Incidents d’IA (AIM) de l’organització per rastrejar dades en llengua àrab. Orient Mitjà, una regió cada vegada més implicada en el desenvolupament i la regulació de la intel·ligència artificial, disposa de poques dades sobre incidents i polítiques relacionades amb la IA. A través d’aquest Memorando de Entendimiento, Aràbia Saudita, representada per SDAIA, adopta un enfocament proactiu per donar resposta a aquesta llacuna. En col·laborar estretament amb l’OCDE, el país pretén millorar el seguiment de les polítiques d’IA i la notificació d’incidents, garantint que els països de parla àrab puguin contribuir activament al benefici mundial de la IA i beneficiar-se’n. El Monitor d’Incidents d’IA de l’OCDE està dissenyat per documentar els incidents i els perills de la IA, proporcionant als responsables polítics, als professionals de la IA i a les parts interessades en l’àmbit mundial una visió crítica dels riscos i danys que plantegen els sistemes d’IA. A més, exerceix un paper essencial en la identificació de patrons de risc i el foment d’una comprensió col·lectiva de la naturalesa dels incidents relacionats amb la intel·ligència artificial. D’aquesta manera, l’acord se centra en l’avenç de les capacitats de supervisió de la IA a tota la regió gràcies a la col·laboració amb entitats locals per garantir una notificació més exhaustiva dels incidents relacionats amb la IA. A través d’aquesta col·laboració, els recursos de l’OCDE, inclosa la base de dades de més de 1.000 polítiques d’IA de 70 països, s’enriquiran amb coneixements valuosos de l’Orient Mitjà. Aquests esforços formen part d’una iniciativa més àmplia per donar suport a la recopilació i intercanvi de mètriques d’IA a escala mundial, ajudant els països a abordar col·lectivament les oportunitats i els reptes que planteja la IA. El memoràndum d’entesa és un pas significatiu per garantir sistemes d’IA fiables que s’ajustin a les normes internacionals. L’acord va ser signat durant la tercera edició de la Cimera Global d’IA (GAIN) celebrada a Riad i que va reunir més de 300 líders, experts i especialistes a IA de tot el món.",
