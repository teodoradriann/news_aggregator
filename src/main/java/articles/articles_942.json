    "title": "Special Interests Intent on Killing School Choice Don’t Care About Kids. Luckily, Wisconsin’s Supreme Court Does.",
    "text": "Liberal activist\nKirk Bangstad’s Minocqua Brewing Co. SuperPAC on Oct. 12 filed a petition with the Wisconsin Supreme Court that sought to dismantle the state’s popular school choice programs and shutter the state’s independent charter schools.\nBangstad hired international law firm Perkins Coie LLP—armed with more than $1 billion in revenue and 1,120 attorneys—to take on 60,000 low- and middle-income Wisconsin families benefiting from those\nhttps://www.dailysignal.com/2023/12/13/new-education-model-charts-course-for-success-sequence-in-new-year/ programs.\nYet, despite a bottomless war chest and a newly Democrat-leaning judiciary, the Wisconsin Supreme Court unceremoniously\ndismissed Bangstad’s petition on Dec. 13 in a unanimous order.\nMy organization—the Liberty Justice Center—filed an\namicus brief in the case and praised the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision to uphold https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/11/15/best-way-fight-indoctrination-schools-school-choice/.\nBut what if Bangstad’s campaign had succeeded?\nIn an\nexplosive report by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, Will Flanders analyzed data from Wisconsin’s Department of Public Instruction and revealed that the sudden tidal wave of new students displaced by the end of https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/11/13/florida-again-earns-top-spot-on-heritage-foundations-education-freedom-report-card/ would have overwhelmed the state’s public schools, severely compromising the quality of education available to Wisconsin students.\nFor example, the Milwaukee Public Schools would have gone from a surplus of more than 20,000 seats to a deficit of more than 17,000—necessitating the immediate purchase or construction of at least 17 new school buildings. Likewise, to maintain its current student-teacher ratio, Milwaukee Public Schools would have needed to hire almost 2,400 additional teachers—a nearly 57% increase in its current teaching staff.\nThose numbers are particularly daunting when considering that the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction is already facing a drastic teacher shortage, having recently tripled the number of emergency teaching licenses issued in the state.\nEven Bangstad’s lawyers were compelled to “recognize” that dismantling school choice in Wisconsin would “impact tens of thousands of children,” but they nevertheless tried to justify their lawsuit by noting that their client “feel[s] that” the benefit to children currently attending traditional public schools “outweighs the negative impacts to the children currently benefiting from these programs.” As Flanders’ analysis shows, however, these “feelings” were not grounded in reality.\nThis lawsuit would have been a death knell not only for the school choice programs despised by the establishment, but also for the traditional public schools Bangstad claims to support.\nUnfortunately, Bangstad is not alone in his rabid campaign against school choice. Lawsuits are currently pending before the Supreme Courts of\nSouth Carolina and Oklahoma attempting to thwart those states’ nascent expansions of educational options for kids.\nIn\nTexas, teachers unions successfully lobbied the legislature to kill a school choice bill—one that would have increased their own teacher members’ salaries at public schools—just to ensure that students are left without other educational options.\nAnd, most shamefully, a feckless state legislature and governor in\nIllinois bent to the will of a teacher union’s president—one whose own child attends private school—by allowing the Illinois Invest in Kids program to expire, effectively kicking 9,600 low-income students out of their preferred schools.\nWisconsin students and families are fortunate that their state Supreme Court stood firm on their behalf. Public officials in all states should follow their lead and stand with kids—not with special interests.\nThe Daily Signal publishes a variety of perspectives.

    "title": "Blue Collar Workers Won Big In 2023, Defying Bleak Predictions - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "[Entrepreneurs](../) Blue collar workers won big in 2023, defying bleak predictions Employers agreed to pay more for workers because of a historically tight labor market, meaning it proved more economical to boost wages and benefits than to try to find new workers or risk losing current ones. The unemployment rate, a key indicator of the labor market’s health, has remained below 4 percent for two years [as of November](//www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/08/jobs-november-unemployment/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7), a stretch last accomplished in the 1960s. And hourly wage growth began to outpace inflation this spring after years of falling behind, boosting workers’ standard of living, especially the lowest earners. “Resilience was really the theme for the labor market in 2023,” said Daniel Zhao, lead economist at the jobs site Glassdoor, noting that a tight labor market created a ripe environment for a heightened number of workers to strike. “We entered the year with significant headwinds. But as the year progressed, the labor market was able to continue powering forward.” Headed into 2023, many Wall Street forecasters were predicting a recession. The Federal Reserve was in the midst of an aggressive campaign to raise interest rates to fight inflation, leading to the widespread belief that the unemployment rate would rise in response to weakened labor demand. Those fears lingered into the early months of the year, as 160,000 [layoffs in the tech industry ](//www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/06/layoff-numbers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10)in the first three months of the year and a [series of bank failures](//www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/13/bank-failure-size-svb-signature/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10) briefly sparked concerns about a broader meltdown in the economy. But recession fears faded as [stronger-than-expected](//www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/24/consumer-spending-wealthy-economy-gdp/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12) consumer spending pushed employers to keep hiring at a healthy clip. Fierce competition for workers has pushed employers to continue to raise wages, with the bottom 25 percent of wage earners seeing the biggest wage gains this year, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, called 2023 “genuinely a banner year for the working class and low paid workers,” noting the economic recovery since covid has been strongest for those on the lower end of the income scale. “Low unemployment is the most important thing raising the stock of American workers,” he said. “The second most important thing is they’ve managed to negotiate quite substantial real wage gains.” The strength of the labor market played a crucial role in a series of strikes that helped secure the strongest union contracts in decades across a variety of industries this year. “When the labor market is tight, union activity is less risky because you’re more likely to be able to find another job in a reasonable time if an employer retaliates against you,” said Heidi Shierholz, former Labor Department economist and president of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank. Notably, 11,500 screenwriters [walked out](//www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/05/02/wga-strike-2023-writers-guild-america/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20) in May, [followed](//www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/hollywood-writers-actors-strike-sag-aftra/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20) by 160,000 actors in July, bringing Hollywood to a standstill for the first time since the 1960s, eventually [securing](//www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2023/11/15/sag-strike-end-what-to-know/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20) streaming bonuses and protections against the use of artificial intelligence. Then 45,000 workers at the Big 3 Detroit automakers staged the auto-manufacturing industry’s [most disruptive strike in decades](//www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/12/fain-uaw-contract-wins/?itid=lk_inline_manual_23), winning raises of at least 25 percent over 4½ years and the ability to strike over plant closures. Meanwhile, 75,000 Kaiser Permanente health-care workers walked off the job for three days in October, making for largest health-care work stoppage in U.S. history, scoring raises of more than 20 percent over four years and a new $25 hourly minimum wage in California. Shenika Brown, who cleans hospital beds and operating rooms for Kaiser in Irvine, Calif., said she expects her pay to jump from $20 to $25 an hour when the contract gains kick in with her next paycheck. This year she regularly picked up 16-hour shifts, which ran from 7 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., and that meant not seeing her 3-year-old son after getting home. “I was missing out on a lot of family time,” Brown said. “The question was, ‘am I putting gas in my car or do I eat this week? I ate 25-cent noodles. All eating out had to stop. This raise will change that.” Even mere strike threats pushed employers into agreeing to eye-popping wage gains. In Nevada, the powerful Culinary Workers Union won 32 percent in raises in their five year contract — the biggest raises in close to 90 years — for some 40,000 workers, the union said, after workers authorized a strike this fall. Among them was Maria Bedolla, a housekeeper for the past 17 years at the Mandalay Bay Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Her pay rose by $3 an hour to $24.62 an hour with the new contract. The raise will allow her to save up for a vacation to Cancún, but her finances are still tight due to “inflation being too high,” she said. Some economists note that these historic wage increases are not as strong as they look on paper because inflation has eaten away at workers’ paychecks. Inflation has been falling in recent months, but prices for many products are substantially higher than they were before the pandemic. Still, the momentum in the labor movement is more than just a response to a hot labor market and inflation, according to labor economists, historians and sociologists. Workers are responding to the riskier working conditions they endured during the pandemic and decades of watching their wages remain relatively stagnant as corporate profits and executive compensation soared. CEO pay at the Big 3 automakers rose by 40 percent compared with 6 percent for workers in the four years leading up to the auto strike, according to union officials. “The reason workers became militant was because of really understanding that employers were doing extremely well,” said Rebecca Givan, a professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. “And unless workers fought back, they weren’t going to get a share of that.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has argued that this year’s strikes have caused “collateral damage to a host of local businesses and communities,” including by increasing consumer costs and hurting small businesses. But workers’ sentiments are reflected in polling data. American support for unions has soared over the past decade, after hitting a record low during the Great Recession. Sixty-seven percent of Americans said they support unions, according to a 2023 Gallup poll. The popularity of these movements conceals the ongoing weakness of the labor movement as measured by the steady decline in union membership over the last 40 years. Union representation [hit a record low](//www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/19/union-membership-2022/?itid=lk_inline_manual_43) in 2022, with around 10.1 percent of U.S. workers in unions, down from 20.1 percent in 1983. And union density in the United States is likely to have dropped again in 2023, as the workforce probably grew at a faster rate than workers joined unions, said Shierholz, the Economic Policy Institute director. Indeed, the vast majority of American workers did not engage in strikes or work stoppages in 2023. But millions of workers did benefit from substantial wage gains, in part due to easing inflation — at 3.1 percent in November, plentiful job opportunities and the ability to switch jobs. Hardy job creation in service-providing industries, such as health care, education and state and local government, has helped keep the labor market favorable to workers, even as growth in industries like manufacturing, retail and professional and business services has been sluggish in 2023. More vulnerable groups of workers are faring remarkably well compared with previous periods of economic recovery. The unemployment rate for Black workers, which is often double the White unemployment rate, [hit an all-time low](//www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/04/07/black-unemployment-rate-record-low/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48) in May, at 5 percent, though it has since risen to 5.8 percent. And the unemployment rate for those without college degrees is also near its lowest point on record. Typically, higher wage earners recover their losses faster, as they did after the 2008 Recession, but the pandemic recovery turned that logic on its head. “Whenever the economy slows, the first people hurt are the working class,” said Wolfers, the University of Michigan economist. “It’s remarkable that this has been a recovery that has delivered a huge amount for production and nonsupervisory workers.” By many measures, the labor market is arriving back at its 2019 pre-pandemic normal, a period defined by low unemployment and strong wage gains for low-wage workers. And economists expect the labor market to continue to settle into a healthy pace of growth in 2024. That, combined with a fresh set of union contract expirations, could bring about a fresh wave of strikes in the new year. Union contracts covering tens of thousands of AT&T wireline workers, Hollywood television and film crew workers, and Boeing workers will expire throughout the year and could keep the strike wave rolling.

    "title": "Why are so many of Israel's fallen soldiers from religious Zionist camp? - The Jerusalem Post",
    "text": "‘In these difficult days of war, it is impossible to ignore the large number of fallen soldiers from the religious-Zionist camp,” read a Tuesday evening post on X.\n“We should salute this community that gives its life for the defense of Israel.”\nWhat makes that post interesting is the man who wrote it: leading left-wing activist Uri Zaki, the executive committee chairman of Meretz , not a party with a particular soft spot for religious Zionism or its adherents.\nYet the reality of this war prompted Zaki to highlight that an inordinate percentage of the fallen have come from the religious Zionist community.\nFor instance, of the 11 IDF soldiers who fell in Gaza from Monday through Wednesday, eight came from the religious Zionist camp. And of the 167 fallen since the beginning of the ground invasion, some 30 have come from settlements in Judea and Samaria. An Israeli soldier prays, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, near the Israel-Gaza border, in southern Israel, December 20, 2023. (credit: RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS) Almost half of Israel's fallen in this war have come from the religious Zionist camp\nChannel 12 political commentator Amit Segal said Wednesday that 45% of the fallen in this war came from that camp, and that just as Israel salutes the Druze because of their sacrifice – six Druze soldiers fell in the war, and as a result, there was talk of changing the Nation-State Law , which the Druze community finds offensive – so too should there be acknowledgment of the sacrifice being paid by the religious Zionist community.\nSome may take issue with this, saying that going through the list of the fallen and dividing them into sectors just perpetuates the divisions in the country, which helped lead to the Hamas decision to strike now when the country was so badly divided. Advertisement\nBut the grisly statistics are worth pointing out for two reasons. The first is to recognize and try to duplicate elsewhere the values that are being transmitted within the religious Zionist camp toward the love of land, country, people and Torah of Israel, and a willingness to sacrifice for the collective.\nThe religious-Zionist camp – as distinguished from the hard right-wing Religious Zionist party that wrongly appropriated the name – is a big tent that includes left-wing members of religious kibbutzim and right-wing residents of settlements like Elon Moreh.\nInside the religious-Zionist rubric, you have Chili Tropper and Elazar Stern on the Left side and Bezalel Smotrich and Orit Struck on the Right.\nThough they may differ on many issues – from possible concessions to Palestinians to LGBTQ rights – most within this camp agree that there is religious significance in the reborn State of Israel and that defending it is both a historic privilege and a religious value.\nFurthermore, those in this camp generally educate their children with these values, something that can be seen in the high percentage of recruits from religious-Zionist schools opting to go into combat units.\nThe disproportionate share of religious soldiers who have fallen reflects their disproportionate presence in these units.\nThe second reason why it is worth mentioning the number of religious Zionists who have fallen is that, over the years, parts of this community have been demonized as “messianists” and “fascists.”\nOne of the flagship institutions of the right flank of this community – the Bnei David pre-army IDF preparatory yeshiva in Eli – has been especially demonized, with its head, Rabbi Yigal Levenstein, literally chased out of Tel Aviv a couple of weeks before October 7, with protesters shouting at him: “Go away, fascist! Go back to the settlements; you don’t belong here!”\nFifteen Bnei David alumni have fallen so far in this war.\nAs Segal said, “For years there was a campaign of defamation and slander against religious Zionism and settlers – for example, against Eli – it is poisonous, needs to be closed, [and] needs to be blown up.” Perhaps, he said, it is now time to think of this camp differently.\nOr, as investigative journalist for the Uvda program Yair Eizenberg wrote on X recently, “I apologize to the religious Zionist community, in which I was raised, and which I have often criticized. I apologize for dismissing what I saw as its militarism and its sanctification of bereavement over life.”\nMetaphorically referring to the religious Zionist community as a “factory,” he wrote: “I thank the factory that is responsible for raising masses of excellent young people who are willing to pay with their lives to protect mine.”\nTo which we can only add: Yes, thank you, indeed.",

    "text": "Varios vuelos que debían aterrizar en Mendoza o salir desde la provincia, no podrán hacerlo por el viento Zonda. Algunos fueron cancelados y otros presentan demoras. Los detalles Producto del viento Zonda que comenzó en horas de la madrugada en el Gran Mendoza, varios vuelos que debían despegar desde el Aeropuerto El Plumerillo en la mañana de este viernes tuvieron que ser suspendidos o reprogramados. De acuerdo a la información aportada por Contingencias Climáticas la provincia amaneció con viento Zonda “afectando precordillera, Uspallata, Gran Mendoza, Oeste de Valle de Uco y Malargüe, intensificando cerca de las 14 prolongándose hasta cerca de las 19 en Malargue, Oeste de San Rafael y Sur de Valle de Uco”. En estas condiciones meteorológicas, los aviones programados no pueden despegar ni aterrizar en la provincia. Por esa razón, las autoridades tomaron la determinación de suspender dos vuelos. La web de Aeropuertos Argentina informa que uno de Flybondi que tenía horario de despegue a las 6:50 desde Aeroparque, y otro de Jet Smart con aterrizaje previsto que iba a salir a las 6:55. Otros tres vuelos fueron demorados. Uno desde Aeroparque que tenía horario a las 6:45 y se estima que podría partir a las 9:10, otro de Latam desde Lima que no tiene horario estimativo de despegue y el último, desde Ezeiza que se espera que salga a las 11:15. En cuanto a las partidas desde el Aeropuerto mendocino, los vuelos que partían hacia Aeroparque a las 7:20 y 7:28 de las empresas Flybondi y JetSmart fueron cancelados, mientras que el los vuelos de Aerolíneas con destino a Aeroparque y Córdoba fueron demorados y se espera que salgan a las 10:15 y 11:30 respectivamente. Por su parte, el vuelo de Latam con destino a Lima aún no tiene horario estimado de salida.
