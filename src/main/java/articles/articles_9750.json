    "text": "AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah on Thursday received Türkiye Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. The meeting covered efforts to stop the war on Gaza, and end the worsening humanitarian catastrophe in the Strip, with His Majesty expressing appreciation of Türkiye’s firm positions and its efforts to stop the war, according to a Royal Court statement.\nThe King stressed the importance of close coordination between the two countries, and the need to build on the efforts of the ministerial committee assigned by the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit to step up international efforts to stop the war.\nHis Majesty reaffirmed the need to push towards an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, protect civilians, and allow the uninterrupted delivery of relief and medical aid.\nThe King warned against Israeli escalations in the West Bank, including extremist settler violence against the Palestinians and violations against Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, adding that these violations must be stopped before they lead to chaos in the West Bank and an explosion in the region.\nHis Majesty reiterated Jordan’s complete rejection of the forced displacement of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, stressing the importance of mobilising the international community to pressure Israel into enabling Gazans to return to their homes.\nThe King stressed Jordan’s rejection of attempts to separate Gaza and the West Bank, as they are both part of the Palestinian state.\nHis Majesty also called for unifying regional positions to push for a real political horizon that leads to the two-state solution, guaranteeing the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 4 June 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, Director of the Office of His Majesty Jafar Hassan and Turkish Ambassador to Jordan Erdem Ozan attended the meeting.",

    "text": "Negotiations on the new national minimum wage that resumed on Friday between officials of the organised labor and Zamfara state government ended in a deadlock. NLC officials left the meeting which held in one of the conference rooms at the Government House, in Gusau at about 6:06pm. Zamfara state government had a few weeks ago through the head of Service Ahmed Liman who is the leader of the negotiation team of the state government announced that the state government will implement the N70, 000 Minimum wage at the end of the workers verification excercise expected to end in December. A week later, the NLC in Zamfara state through its chairman, Sani Halliru threatened to embark on indefinite strike if Government refused to pay the New National Minimum wage. The NLC officials who left the meeting room angrily refused to speak to newsmen. A few minutes later, the Zamfara state government delegates also declined to speak to journalist but assured that the meeting will resume in a few days. This is coming a few hours after the NLC National body directed workers in Abia, Akwa Ibom,Imo,Ebonyi, Ekiti, Enugu, FCT, Nasarawa, Kaduna, Katsina, Oyo, Sokoto and Zamfara States to commence indefinite strike from Tuesday 2nd December 2024 following the non implementation of the national minimum wage in the affected States.",

    "text": "By Eric Bradner, Arit John, Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood and MJ Lee, CNN\n(CNN) — Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is growing more defiant in the face of Donald Trump ’s efforts to push her out of the 2024 Republican primary race , poking and prodding at the former president and encouraging supporters to wear Trump’s attacks as a badge of honor.\nReturning to her home state Wednesday, Haley mocked Trump’s victory speech in New Hampshire the night earlier — one in which the former president raged about the concession speech Haley had just delivered.\nShe said Trump “pitched a fit,” called him “insecure” and declared he “should feel threatened, without a doubt.” She cast doubt on his mental competency — the same line of attack Trump and his allies have long leveled at President Joe Biden — and dared Trump to debate her one-on-one.\n“Bring it, Donald,” she said in North Charleston. “Show me what you got.”\nHaley’s increasingly pointed attacks on Trump come amid pressure from many Republicans for her to drop out of the 2024 primary race so that the party can coalesce around the former president — who is seeking a third consecutive nomination.\nPolls show Haley is far behind Trump in South Carolina, where many of her former allies have turned on her and the Republican primary electorate is much more conservative than that of New Hampshire — where she lost to Trump by 11 points.\nStill, she remains a thorn in the former president’s side, provoking his ire in ways the 2024 Republican presidential contenders he’s already dispatched never did.\nAnd Haley’s aides say that’s intentional.\nHer campaign is bracing for Trump to go too far in attacking Haley and believes those attacks are likely to boost her support in South Carolina. One campaign official said Trump’s attacks would be a “key piece” of Haley’s pathway to winning over Palmetto State voters ahead of the February 24 primary .",

    "text": "Pope Francis looked well as he washed and kissed the feet of 12 women prisoners on Thursday at a traditional ritual on the first of four event-filled days leading to Easter for the 87-year-old pontiff. Francis travelled to Rome’s Rebibbia prison, in a run-down area on Rome’s outskirts, to preside at a Holy Thursday Mass for dozens of inmates, guards, chaplains and officials gathered in an outdoor area of the female section. From his wheelchair, he washed and kissed the right foot of 12 women sitting on a riser in a ritual commemorating Jesus’ gesture of humility to his apostles at the Last Supper on the night before he was crucified. A number of the inmates were foreigners and some cried as he performed the ritual. The female section of the prison, one of Italy’s largest, holds about 370 inmates who are jailed for various offences. Francis is the first pope to hold the foot-washing ceremony outside churches, usually in prisons, homes for the elderly or hospices, continuing a practice he began when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires. He is also the first pope to include women, atheists, Muslims and other non-Christians in the service. Previous pope held the service in either St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican or the Basilica of St. John in Lateran and included only men, usually priests. Francis wove his short, improvised homily around the theme of service to others. “Each of you has their own story but the Lord listens to us with open arms and never tires of forgiving,” he said. Francis, who recently curtailed his speaking engagements because of fatigue related to bouts of bronchitis and influenza, seemed fit. When he arrived at the prison, an aide pushed his wheelchair around the small crowd and many inmates rushed forward to touch him. ‘RAY OF SUNLIGHT’ The prison director, Nadia Fontana, told the pope he had brought the institution “a ray of sunlight,” and inmates gave him items, including liturgical vestments, that they had made in prison workshops. Francis stood for parts of the service and then, while seated, greeted the prisoners and a three-year-old boy who lives there with his inmate mother. Francis also looked well and strong earlier on Thursday at a Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, where he read a long homily and improvised part of it. On Good Friday, the day Christians commemorate Jesus’ crucifixion, Francis is due to preside at a “Passion of the Lord” service in St. Peter’s Basilica and then attend a traditional evening Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at Rome’s Colosseum. He will preside at an Easter Vigil service on Saturday, and on Sunday will read his twice-annual “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and world) message and blessing from the central balcony of St Peter’s to tens of thousands of people in the square below.

    "text": "2024-03-09 21:45:00\nThe 13th Magritte du cinéma took place this Saturday evening. And a strong moment came during the evening when around ten participants in the ceremony took the stage to denounce the war between Israel and Hamas and launch an appeal for peace.\nPeople called for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip and demanded the release of Hamas hostages. “Our thoughts go to the families of the 1,200 victims of the Hamas attack on October 7, but also to the families of the 30,000 Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza. We call for the return of the hostages but we also say the impossible moral justification of human, material, and ethical massacre underway in Gaza for 5 months,” declared the participants.\nThey also had a message addressed to the Belgian government, asking it to contribute to a cease-fire, to the sending of humanitarian aid, to the cessation of arms exports to Israel and to the release of all the hostages.\nNote that some winners, as we can see in the image below, collected their prize with a badge in the colors of Palestine.\nSandrine Blancke appears with a badge in the colors of Palestine\n1710027779\n#Magrittes #strong #gesture #IsraelHamas #war\nRelated posts:\nA crowded reception for the Stray Kids band at Riyadh Airport The Messy 2023 Golden Globes Failed to Justify Its Existence – Rolling Stone \"Center Pompidou Paris to Close for Restoration Works and Asbestos Removal Until 2030: Updates and D... \"He is without oxygen and with a lot of love\": Nacho Gutiérrez and the delicate situation he is goin... \"to win!

    "text": "Fidelity Investments has introduced an individual retirement account (IRA) that permits private investors to invest in cryptocurrencies under its web3-focused subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets.\nAccording to the company’s website, investors can add virtual assets to their retirement portfolio through Fidelity Crypto for IRAs. However, only Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin are the assets available now.\nThere are three types of account registrations for IRAs: Fidelity Crypto Rollover IRA, Fidelity Crypto Traditional IRA, and Fidelity Crypto Roth IRA.\nAccess to these accounts is also restricted. The restrictions indicate that an investor must be a citizen of the United States and at least 18 years old.\nA Fidelity representative stated that the firm was committed to offering investment products and solutions to respond to its customers’ ever-evolving needs and interests and providing education and support.\nMoreover, reliable sources previously reported that the introduction of Fidelity’s IRAs with a crypto focus came after the introduction of a number of digital asset investment vehicles, including Volatility Shares’ two exchange-traded funds that track the performance of Solana and proposed funds that track Litecoin, BNB, PENGU, and other tokens.\nBased on market capitalization, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin rank first, second, and twenty-third, respectively.\nBefore introducing these IRAs, Fidelity Investments had previously concentrated on the token market\nFidelity Investments was also reviewing the tokenized U.S. Treasury market and testing its own stablecoin in March. This move started after Fidelity filed a request to launch a tokenized version of its U.S. dollar money market fund a few days ago.\nIn addition, an insider said Fidelity Digital Assets was testing a stablecoin it had developed. However, another source cited Fidelity Investments—a $5 trillion asset manager with a crypto focus—as saying it did not currently plan to launch the token.\nAdditionally, the cryptocurrency custodian BitGo introduced its USDS stablecoin in January, and the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial decentralized finance project announced on March 25 that it would introduce a USD1 stablecoin that is dollar-pegged.\nThus, it is worth noting that stablecoins have seen increased usage and expansion among cryptocurrency owners since they were first introduced in 2014.\nSeveral companies, including Fidelity, with a background in launching dollar-backed tokens in the United States, are competing to enter the space ahead of lawmakers’ efforts to establish clearer rules for stablecoin issuers.\nPresident Trump similarly called for “simple, common-sense rules” for stablecoins at a New York crypto conference. He said the tokens would aid “the dominance of the U.S. dollar.”\nLast month, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the bipartisan Genius Act, legislation that would create new stablecoin regulations. However, the bill isn’t expected to gain much support in the Senate.\nCryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025. Learn More",
