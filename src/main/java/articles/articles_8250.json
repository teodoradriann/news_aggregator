    "text": "Bears Pursue Special Teams Upgrade\nThe Bears have secured a one-year contract with Devin Duvernay, signaling their commitment to improving their special teams performance. This strategic move comes after challenges in the return game in recent seasons, as the team looks to integrate a player with proven capabilities.\nEvolving Role as a Return Specialist\nDrafted in the third round in 2020, Duvernay originally joined the league with an expectation to contribute as a receiver. Over time, he distinguished himself by excelling in the return game. His skills earned him a role in the Pro Bowl as a return specialist in both 2021 and 2022. Additionally, he was recognized as a First-team All-Pro in 2021 during his second year in the league.\nTransition from the Ravens to the Bears\nAfter his time with the Baltimore Ravens, where he was primarily utilized on special teams, Duvernay continued to develop his return game in the subsequent season. His recent stint with another team further highlighted his abilities, and now he embarks on a new chapter with the NFC North team. The Bears view his experience and skill set as key to addressing their previous struggles on special teams and enhancing their overall effectiveness.\nAnticipation for Impact\nThe signing of Duvernay reflects the Bears’ proactive approach and willingness to make targeted moves to bolster their performance. With his track record and refined expertise as a return specialist, his presence is expected to bring dynamism and improvement to the special teams unit, offering the team a much-needed boost in a critical phase of the game.",

Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nThousands of government supporters on Thursday flocked to the memorial service for senior Iranian commander Seyed Razi Mousavi, who Tehran says was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Syria.\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was among the many high-ranking politicians and officers attending the burial service at a Shiite shrine in Tehran, according to Iranian state media.\nMousavi, from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed on Monday in a suspected Israeli airstrike on a suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus.\nThe leadership in Tehran has vowed to avenge his death.\nIRGC commander-in-chief Hossein Salami repeated old threats against Israel during a speech at the service.\n\"Our revenge is always bitter. But a revenge equivalent to the martyrdom of Seyed Razi is nothing less than erasing this Zionist regime from the pages of history,\" the IRNA news agency quoted the Salami as saying.\nIran's leadership has repeatedly threatened to destroy Israel, its declared arch-enemy since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\nAccording to the New York Times, Mousavi is said to have helped monitor weapons deliveries to Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, which is backed by Iran and has repeatedly launched attacks on northern Israel in support of Hamas since the beginning of the Gaza war.\nIsrael frequently attacks locations in war-torn Syria to prevent Iran from further expanding its military influence in the region via local militias.\nMousavi was a confidant of the powerful IRGC General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by the US in a drone attack in Iraq in 2020.\nMousavi had decades of military experience in Syria and Lebanon. Although little was previously known about the general, he was considered one of the most influential officers of the Revolutionary Guard abroad.\nIran, alongside Russia, is the most important ally of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad. Tehran considers Syria to be part of the so-called \"axis of resistance\" in its fight against Israel, alongside Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\nAccording to Tehran, however, Iranian military personnel are not directly involved in the Syrian civil war and act only as advisers.\nView comments",

    "text": "North Dakota Senate again passes $30 million incentive for large agricultural developments\nThe Senate had reconsidered and amended the bill to add an emergency clause to allow for the law to be potentially enacted sooner.\nGRAND FORKS — The North Dakota Senate again passed a $30 million incentive funding package for large agriculture developments Wednesday afternoon.\nThe Senate had originally passed the bill on March 26 but decided to reconsider the measure in order to give the Appropriations Committee the chance to further review it. On Wednesday, April 16, the Senate adopted an emergency amendment to the bill, meaning that if Gov. Kelly Armstrong signs the bill into law, it would go into effect immediately rather than in August, like most state laws do.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe bill seeks to give state incentives to large agricultural development and will likely be part of the incentive package for the Agristo development that is being planned for Grand Forks.\nThe Belgian potato processor announced its $450 million plan for its first American facility earlier this year, and\nthis incentive is just one of several planned, including tax incentives from the city.\nThis bill would allow the company to apply for a $30 million grant paid in two parts.\nThe first half would be given when a certificate of occupancy is issued, the rest when the facility has reached 50% of production capacity. The grant works on a reimbursement model and can be used for capital expenditures, infrastructure and site acquisition.\nTo fund the grant, the Bank of North Dakota will be able to extend a line of credit to the agriculture commissioner for grant awards from the Agricultural Diversification and Development Fund. The appropriation measure would\nonly be valid for the biennium that ends in June 2029.\nWith the amendments, it will go back to the House of Representatives for consideration; if it passes with the amendment, it would go directly to Armstrong. If the House doesn't adopt the amendments, it would go potentially go to a conference committee for further consideration.\nTo date, the bill has seen strong support from the Legislature. It passed Wednesday with a 45-5 vote in the Senate and previously passed in March on a 43-3 vote. The House passed the measure in February on an 82-8 vote. The bill has also seen strong support in its several committee hearings from both legislators and testifiers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",

    "text": "Daring Academy Alpha 0.1.0 is coming on January 1st, 2024!\nHere it is, the version you've all been waiting for.\nDaring Academy Alpha 0.1.0 is divided into two versions: Original Version and Chapter 1 Demo.\nDifferences on the Chapter 1 Demo:\n- It's available on Steam Itch.io and Gamejolt for free, even when the main game is done (0.1.0 to 1.0.0 will only be available on Itch.io)\n- Achievements are removed, due to an issue on Steam's end\n- Backgrounds in UIs are changed to the apartment, indicating the moving in of the main character and Amelia\n- Anything regarding the full game has been changed to mention the demo, that includes logos, version numbers, etc\nWe strongly recommend you play the Chapter 1 Demo to get a feel of the game, as if you plan on getting all achievements in the game, saves from the Chapter 1 Demo won't give the achievements from Chapter 1 upon playing Chapter 2 and onward, due to issues with Steam demos and all.\nNote: As with any alphas, there are a ton of internal code changes and file reorganizations, so saves might not be compatible between the old versions. Alpha 0.1.0 and onwards will try to keep as much support with Chapter 1 saves as possible, but may become incompatible in future updates, so beware.\nFor Steam Deck Users: While playtesting the game on Steam Deck, we encountered an issue in Desktop Mode where the keyboard wouldn't show up if it the game was in fullscreen mode, even when pressing Steam+X. If this issue appears to you, please connect a keyboard to your device. The keyboard works fully in gaming mode though.\nIf you have Decky Loader on your Steam Deck, you can change the artworks of the Chapter 1 demo build using SteamGridDB plugin. See the\nofficial GitHub for SteamGridDB to learn how.\nA massive thanks to Imbion, Jenivere, Kalosmuffins, Kit from \"Kit\\'s Workshop\", K0maru, RedRan6er, Wavi, LemonadeMochi, Dark_Green, Carter Vandenberg, UnlishedTen8, optimistic1236, SelLillianna, spottyboi, Jayne/Koriko, Twotoneinc, TimberRaven, bikifrench, chlodiami, Alexei, genderlurker, angelicangela., kortniblini, aksanaip, alainax, bdkcisme, jankbithle, Jaydon (A), Gauncamole, Fabryn, Hallowuette, ayinsis and everyone I missed for playtesting throughout 0.0.1 to 0.1.0's development phase. This demo wouldn't be possible without all of you.\nYou can download and play 0.0.1, known as the Legacy Edition to see all the progress in 3 years of development. This edition of 0.0.1 doesn't change the story from said version but adds smaller things like a smaller cursor, Discord rich presence support, etc. Go to\nhttps://thediamondcryst.itch.io/daring-academy-chapter-1-demo or select the Legacy branch in the Steam build settings to play it. Note: Any issues in this version will not be fixed. Saves in that version of the game are also not compatible with the Chapter 1 Demo, 0.1.0, or the full game.\nAs a final thank you, thanks to Dandelier for making the image in the header perfectly representing Chapter 1.

    "text": "Nvidia a critiqué jeudi un projet signalé de l'administration de Joe Biden visant à imposer de nouvelles restrictions sur les exportations de puces d'IA, affirmant que le dirigeant américain sortant ne devrait pas \"préempter le président Trump entrant\" en promulguant une politique de dernière minute. \"Nous encourageons le président Biden à ne pas devancer le futur président Trump en promulguant une politique qui ne fera que nuire à l'économie américaine, faire reculer l'Amérique et faire le jeu des adversaires des États-Unis\", a déclaré Ned Finkle, vice-président de Nvidia, dans un communiqué envoyé par courriel.\nLe ministère américain du Commerce et la Maison Blanche n'ont pas immédiatement répondu aux demandes de commentaires de Reuters en dehors des heures de bureau.\nLe mois dernier, Reuters a publié des détails exclusifs sur le plan du département du commerce visant à approuver les exportations mondiales de puces d'IA tout en empêchant les mauvais acteurs d'y accéder. L'un des principaux objectifs de ces restrictions est d'empêcher l'IA de renforcer les capacités militaires de la Chine.\nBloomberg News a rapporté jeudi que de nouvelles réglementations en matière d'exportation pourraient être annoncées prochainement, ajoutant qu'un groupe d'adversaires des États-Unis se verrait effectivement interdire l'importation de ces puces, tandis que la grande majorité du monde serait confrontée à des limites sur la puissance de calcul totale pouvant aller à un pays.\nM. Finkle, de Nvidia, a déclaré que la politique annoncée était déguisée en \"mesure anti-Chine\" et a averti que le plafond extrême par pays affecterait les ordinateurs dans le monde entier et pousserait le monde vers des technologies alternatives.\n\"Cette politique de dernière minute de l'administration Biden laissera un héritage qui sera critiqué par l'industrie américaine et la communauté internationale\", a déclaré M. Finkle.\nLe Conseil de l'industrie des technologies de l'information, qui représente des entreprises telles qu'Amazon, Microsoft et Meta, a déclaré que cette règle imposerait des contraintes arbitraires sur la capacité des entreprises américaines à vendre des systèmes informatiques à l'étranger et céderait le marché mondial à la concurrence.\nLe président élu des États-Unis, Donald Trump, a imposé lors de son premier mandat des restrictions sur la vente de technologies américaines à la Chine en invoquant la sécurité nationale. Le second mandat de M. Trump commence le 20 janvier.\nLes actions de Nvidia ont baissé de plus de 1 % au cours des échanges prolongés de jeudi après le rapport de Bloomberg.",

    "text": "Она находилась во Франции на отдыхе с семьей. У ребенка было слабое здоровье. Во время прогулки девочка упала в обморок. Прибывшие на место медики сделали ей массаж сердца. Но реанимировать не смогли.\nПо предварительным данным, на состояние девочки могла оказать влияние аномальная жара, указывает РБК.\nЧто произошло\nИз-за африканского антициклона «Плутон» Франция столкнулась с аномальной жарой.\nВ 16 департаментах введен красный — самый высокий — уровень опасности из-за погодных условий. По прогнозам, жара достигнет пика в середине недели. В некоторых районах страны температура может подняться до +40 градусов.\nУлицы Парижа заметно опустели. Больницы готовятся к увеличению числа пациентов, пострадавших от перегрева и других последствий жары, пишет ura.ru.\nВласти Парижа закрыли доступ на вершину Эйфелевой башни для туристов из-за аномально высокой температуры воздуха.\nИталия также оказалась в зоне аномальной жары. В городе Теце-суль-Брента, Виченца, двое рабочих потеряли сознание на стройке. Один из них впал в кому. Медики провели реанимационные мероприятия на месте, после чего пострадавшего доставили в больницу на вертолете в клинику. Состояние второго не уточняется, сообщает overclockers.ru. В Испании также зафиксированы смертельные случаи.\nВ Испании и Португалии температура достигает +46 °C. Такая же температура воздуха в Греции, пишет pravilamag.ru.\nРанее сообщалось, что аномальная жара «родом» из Туркменистана накрыла Алтайский край и другие сибирские регионы.\nФакт\n29 июня Испания установила июньский рекорд жары в +46°, сообщает meteovesti.ru.\nТакже сообщалось, как не простыть при аномальной жаре.\nВ жару не рекомендуется есть мороженое. Дело в том, что этот высококалорийный продукт с большой долей жирности и сахара. Мороженое перегружает систему пищеварения и плохо усваивается, переохлаждает слизистую оболочку верхних дыхательных путей и приводит к спазму сосудов. И, как следствие, — возникновению острых респираторных заболеваний (ОРЗ).\nНе лучшее решение — охладиться молочным коктейлем, квасом или лимонадом. Эти напитки только усилят чувство жажды и сохранят больше тепла. Они препятствуют нормальному потоотделению и увеличивают риск обезвоживания.\nЛучше пить воду, чай, компот, морс.\nСамое важное - в нашем Telegram-канале",

    "title": "Canada’s Immigration Detention System Violates Disability Rights | Human Rights Watch",
    "text": "Click to expand Image A new Human Rights Watch report found that while Canada’s immigration detention authorities claim to protect marginalized detainees, the system’s designated representative framework often silences them. Photograph courtesy of Pixabay © Pixabay Prosper Niyonzima, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide, spent nearly five years in immigration detention in Canada, including two years in solitary confinement. After a mental health crisis that left him catatonic, he found himself trapped in a Kafkaesque system that was ill-equipped to meet his needs.\nFollowing his mental health crisis, the tribunal conducting his detention review hearings determined that he was “unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings,” and appointed a designated representative—a person legally empowered to make decisions on his behalf—to communicate with detention authorities for him, to hire and instruct his lawyer, and to provide evidence and testify for him at hearings. This was a person he never met and could not fire, even if he could communicate. His monthly detention review hearings proceeded for years with his designated representative standing in for him.\nNiyonzima’s detention meant losing not only his freedom but also his legal capacity—the right to make basic decisions about his life. Years after his release, he recalled, “Detention destroyed everything. … I never thought this would happen in Canada.”\nOur new Human Rights Watch report exposes routine legal capacity violations that people like Niyonzima endure in immigration detention. Each year, Canada detains thousands of people on immigration grounds, many of whom are fleeing persecution and traumatic experiences. This includes people with disabilities, who frequently face discrimination, prolonged detention, and solitary confinement, which exacerbate existing mental health conditions.\nWe found that while Canada’s immigration detention authorities claim to protect marginalized detainees, the system’s designated representative framework often silences them. The Immigration and Refugee Board has unchecked power to label immigration detainees—including those with intellectual, developmental, cognitive, or psychosocial disabilities—as “unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings.”\nSometimes, these determinations are based on mere observations by detention authorities. The tribunal then appoints designated representatives, who are legally empowered to make decisions for detainees, with life-altering consequences. This substitute decision-making strips detainees of their autonomy and dignity, denying them the right to make crucial choices about their lives.\nDesignated representatives operating in a strictly supportive role can, in some cases, provide crucial help for immigration detainees. But the current framework legally empowers designated representatives to make key decisions unilaterally, without even consulting detainees, and to do so without proper oversight, training, or resources.\nFor many detainees, this means their lives are placed in the hands of representatives whose training, competence, and involvement vary drastically, but whose legal discretion is immense. Some designated representatives rarely communicate with their clients, and others have even acted in alignment with detention authorities.\nThe consequences are profound: according to an independent auditor, the presence of Niyonzima’s designated representative seemed to give the tribunal a false assurance that due process was being followed. Without the agency to influence their own cases, detainees with disabilities are effectively denied justice, forced to navigate a system that further disempowers and marginalizes them.\nCanada’s immigration detention system urgently needs a paradigm shift. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly called for Canada to ultimately abolish immigration detention altogether, starting with the immediate end of detention in correctional facilities. Authorities should prioritize community-based alternatives, offering necessary support—including housing, health care, and legal support—without punitive restrictions for these administrative infractions.\nIn the meantime, the federal government should urgently redesign the role of designated representatives in line with international human rights standards by moving from substitute to supported decision-making. Under this model, designated representatives would assist detainees in making their own decisions, honoring their will and preferences rather than imposing decisions.\nNiyonzima’s story is a stark reminder of the harm caused by these policies, but also the power of support in the community. Once he was released in 2016, he reconnected with community and regained his ability to speak. He got married, had children, and continues to live in Canada.\n“When I was in detention, I didn’t know that change could come,” he told us. “But I can now say that the impossible is possible.”\nCanada should confront deeply rooted societal attitudes that discriminate against people with disabilities. The government has a responsibility to re-root and nurture these systems in human rights. Getting on the path to ending immigration detention while adopting a supportive, rights-based approach is the right place to start.\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world. $50 $100 $250 $500 $1000 Other $ Donate Now More Reading December 23, 2024 Commentary Inter-American Court Finds El Salvador Responsible for Obstetric Violence in Landmark Ruling",
