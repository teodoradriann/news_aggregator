    "text": "Alabama is set to execute an inmate with nitrogen gas. How does it work? By Lauren Mascarenhas, CNN (CNN) — At some point during a 30-hour window that will close at 6 a.m. CT on Friday, the state of Alabama is set to carry out the nation’s first execution by nitrogen gas on death row inmate Kenneth Smith. Smith, who was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire and already survived a botched execution attempt by lethal injection, is at the center of a heated debate over whether the execution method constitutes cruelty. Smith’s lawyers have made several eleventh-hour attempts to prevent the execution. The US Supreme Court on Wednesday denied Smith’s request for a stay of execution this week. A separate federal appeals court ruling on Wednesday evening also declined to halt the execution. Smith’s team appealed to the US Supreme Court again Thursday morning. “Execution is a very specific kind of punishment, and no punishment, according to the US Constitution, can be carried out in a cruel fashion,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “And so the only real question is: Is execution with nitrogen gas cruel?” Why nitrogen gas? Officials started using lethal injection to kill people on death row about 40 years ago, and it’s since become the most widely used execution method across the 27 states where capital punishment is legal. Around 2009, the drugs used to carry out lethal injections became harder to access, and states began turning to alternative drugs – a shift that has been tied to a [surge of complications](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/11/us/lethal-injection-execution-explained-dg/) with the procedure. That’s what happened when Alabama first tried to execute Smith in November 2022, and officials were unable to set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired. Only three states – Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi – have approved the use of nitrogen gas for capital punishment, and experts say there is no real blueprint for the execution method. Alabama has published a protocol for the procedure, though it contains redactions the state says are meant to maintain security. How does it work? Alabama officials plan to use a mask to administer the nitrogen to Smith. Zivot says Smith will likely be strapped down when this occurs. Nitrogen hypoxia will occur when a high concentration of the gas is inhaled, replacing oxygen in the body and causing death. The process essentially disables the respiratory system, said Dr. Jonathan Groner, a professor of surgery at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Some officials say that a person will likely lose consciousness shortly into the procedure, making it more humane than other execution methods. However, doctors say that they cannot pinpoint if or when a person will lose consciousness when exposed to high concentrations of nitrogen gas. Because the circumstances of Smith’s planned execution are so specific and unique, it’s hard to draw comparisons to instances where nitrogen gas played a role in accidental or suicide deaths, Groner said. Is the procedure painful? This month, [United Nations experts](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/01/united-states-un-experts-alarmed-prospect-first-ever-untested-execution) raised the alarm that Smith’s execution could constitute torture, saying in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.” While doctors can’t say definitely what will happen to Smith, the possibilities have left many concerned. If the mask is not secured tightly enough, oxygen could leak in, prolonging the death, experts say. “When we put 100% non-rebreather face masks on our patients, they never get 100%, because there’s some leakage,” Groner said. “I feel pretty confident that he’s not going to just take a deep breath and go to sleep. I think that’s unlikely.” Doctors say the lack of oxygen could lead to seizures, which have been observed in patients experiencing hypoxia. There’s also a possibility that Smith could vomit into the mask, which could cause choking or asphyxiation if inhaled into the lungs. The Department of Corrections altered Smith’s last meal schedule after concerns were raised that he had been “vomiting repeatedly.” Even if a person is fasting, they can still vomit water or stomach fluids, experts say. If stomach acid is aspirated, it could burn the lungs, Zivot noted. The stress, anxiety or flat-out fear that a person might feel before execution shouldn’t be ruled out, Groner said. “When we have an operation and someone’s totally terrified, they actually respond differently to anesthetics, so a lot of times we’ll give them a sedative before we even go into the operating room,” he said. “There’s no talk anywhere of giving (Smith) anything to relax him.” With [most lethal injections](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/11/us/lethal-injection-execution-explained-dg/), a person is first given an anesthetic to render them unconscious. Increased stress has been linked to [heart attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/13/health/stress-levels-heart-wellness/index.html) and other medical events. In a botched 2014 execution, Oklahoma death row inmate [Clayton Lockett](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/politics/clayton-lockett-oklahoma-execution/index.html) was declared dead of a heart attack more than an hour after being strapped to a gurney for an attempted lethal injection. Officials say Smith’s execution is likely to take place on Thursday evening, and what happens in that Alabama execution chamber could set a precedent for other death row prisoners in the state and beyond. If the procedure does not kill Smith, complications could leave him injured or with serious brain damage, experts say. “If they produce a corpse, then the states that want to do this will start doing it,” said Zivot.

    "text": "'Pleasant' temperatures expected as South Canterbury welcomes new year The new year will bring nice weather, following a cracker last Friday of the year when temperatures hit the mid-20s in South Canterbury. While people flocked to Caroline Bay during the afternoon to cool off and enjoy the sun and the water, MetService meteorologist John Law said the forecast for New Year’s Day and beyond would mean cooler weather for the region. “They will be cooler days, but the daytime temperatures will still be pleasant,’’ Law said. The forecast for January 1 was a high of 22C with showers clearing to fine in the evening, while the following day it would be fine again with a few showers developing later in the day. A high of 20C was expected. Wednesday’s temperature was expected to reach 19C with showers, while Thursday it was expected to get to 22C, with a few showers. Law said the overnight temperatures were expected to drop following warmer nights over the weekend, and that would be a welcome relief to many residents. The Caroline Bay Association will also be hoping for good weather for the second week of its annual carnival, with the Boxing Day opening delayed because of heavy rain. Carnival activities this week include the Big Dig, on Monday at 12.30pm, and the children’s pet parade, on Tuesday at 11.30m. Egg and spoon races will begin at 11am the following day. The 13-day carnival finishes on January 7 with a 90-minute show from 2pm at the Caroline Bay Soundshell.",

One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.\nThe date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported.\nHere’s what we know about the date.\nWhat does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month.\n\"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\"\nThe numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number.\nProfessional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.”\nIf you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12.\nThe number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.\nFYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks\nWhat are some dates to keep in mind in 2024? If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.\nA palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nNumerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.\nHere are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac :\n4/2/24 4/20/24 4/21/24 4/22/24 4/23/24 4/24/24 4/25/24 4/26/24 4/27/24 4/28/24 4/29/24 Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today\n30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",

    "text": "News\nArticle\nAuthor(s):\nNeuroOne's OneRF system, already cleared for functional neurosurgery, is now being evaluated by the FDA for trigeminal nerve ablation to treat chronic facial pain.\nAccording to a recent announcement, NeuroOne formally completed its FDA submission for its proprietary OneRF Ablation System for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, a chronic pain condition affecting approximately 100,000 people in the U.S.1\nThe OneRF Trigeminal Nerve Ablation system offers a minimally invasive approach that uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to target and destroy abnormal tissue, providing relief from severe, chronic facial pain. Its multi-contact probe enables precise pain localization, stimulation, and ablation–using a single electrode–with the added safety of temperature-controlled lesioning.\n\"Our OneRF® ablation technology platform has already achieved successful commercialization and patient outcomes in lesioning nerve tissue for functional neurosurgical procedures, such as the treatment of epilepsy. Expanding into facial pain broadens the clinical impact of our technology and further validates the versatility and scalability of our platform,\" Dave Rosa, president and chief executive officer at NeuroOne, said in a statement.1 \"If cleared by the FDA, we believe there is a potential to generate revenues from trigeminal nerve ablation in late calendar year 2025.\"\nIn the context of pain management, RF ablation uses radio waves to create a current that heats a small area of nerve tissue. The heat destroys that area of the nerve, stopping it from sending pain signals to your brain. RF ablation has been shown to provide lasting relief for patients with chronic pain, especially in the lower back, neck, and arthritic joints.2 For patients with trigeminal neuralgia, this procedure involves applying controlled thermal energy to the trigeminal nerve, typically at the Gasserian ganglion, to disrupt pain signal transmission.\nTo date, there are no medications specifically FDA-approved for trigeminal neuralgia. Instead, several drugs approved for other indications–like epilepsy or neuropathic pain–have been used off-label or are recognized in clinical guidelines as first-line treatments for trigeminal neuralgia. These include carbamazepine, which has been shown to be effective in reducing paroxysmal facial pain, and oxcarbazepine, which has been used off-label because of a better tolerability profile than carbamazepine.\nREAD MORE: FDA Approves CT-132 as First Digital Therapeutic for Preventive Treatment of Episodic Migraine\nThe features of the OneRF Trigeminal Nerve Ablation technology are also present in the OneRF stereoencephalography (sEEG) Ablation System, a 510(k) cleared modality. In 2023, the guided tool was granted clearance as a means to record electrical activity and ablate nervous tissue under temperature-controlled environments. At the time, it was the third FDA-cleared product for NeuroOne, following its Evo cortical and sEEG electrode product lines, which are used to primarily record electrical activity in the brain for less than 30 days.3\nThe Evo sEEG Electrode is designed for subsurface brain monitoring and stimulation, helping clinicians pinpoint optimal zones for intervention. It is over seven times thinner than traditional silicone electrodes, offering greater flexibility and reduced volume to help minimize pain and swelling. Its single-tail, single-incision design streamlines access, lowers infection risk, and shortens procedure time. Each electrode comes with a disposable cable assembly, eliminating the need to match cables during surgery.\nA 2023 study published in Pain Medicine compared the effectiveness and safety of trigeminal percutaneous RF ablation in a cohort of 30 consecutive patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia who had failed to respond to drug treatment. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized to receive either a 75 degree thermal RF lesion for 60 seconds following sensory and motor stimulation or a sham procedure. After 1 month, mean scores on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) decreased from 9.2 to 0.7 in the RF group and from 8.9 to 5.8 in the sham group. Overall, the significant reduction was measurable starting at day 1, further supporting the use of RF nerve ablation as a treatment for refractory trigeminal neuralgia.4\n2 Commerce Drive\nCranbury, NJ 08512",

    "text": "Electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties in Scotland without power after Storm Gerrit will be reconnected on Friday. Graeme Keddie, the director of corporate affairs at SSEN, said “hard work” by its staff has reconnected more than 45,000 properties who had lost power as a result of the latest storm to hit the UK. High winds, heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country, but Mr Keddie said that by Friday morning there were 750 homes remaining without electricity, describing that as a “much improved picture”. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, he told how SSEN staff had “made a tremendous effort in restoring power to customers affected by Storm Gerrit, battling some very tough weather conditions”. He said: “We have now restored power to over 45,000 homes and there are now 750 homes still to be connected. “And we’re confident through the resource levels we have we can reconnect these customers throughout today.” He thanked those affected for their “ongoing patience” as the power firm makes its “final push” to restore electricity. Storm Gerrit resulted in a “lot of localised faults” to the power network, Mr Geddie said, adding there were a “lot of points of multiple damage”. This he said was “down to the ferocity of Storm Gerrit”, adding that wind speeds had been up to 10mph higher than had been forecast in some areas. He insisted SSEN had been “well prepared” for this latest blast of wintry weather, but added that “we saw some wind speeds five to 10 miles per hour higher than predicted”. Winds at Inverbervie, on the Aberdeenshire cost, reached 86mph during Storm Gerrit, he said – adding this was higher than the 78mph winds that hit the town during Storm Arwen in November 2021. The latest storm was “more ferocious than forecast”, Mr Geddie stated. But he stressed: “We’re very confident of getting all homes reconnected through the course of today. “We’re got enough people and resource and we are absolutely committed in this final push.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Paint the Plaza Purple brings awareness to Alzheimer’s\nPublished 6:07 pm Wednesday, April 23, 2025\nMore than a hundred Meridian and Lauderdale County residents came out to Dumont Plaza on Tuesday to raise awareness about Alzheimer’s disease at the third annual Paint the Plaza Purple.\nThe yearly event, organized by Daniel Donnelly, has already become one of the signature fundraisers for the Alzheimer’s Association in Mississippi.\nEmail newsletter signup\nJennifer Bennett, executive director for The Mississippi Alzheimer’s Association, said Paint the Plaza Purple is breaking barriers and opening up conversations about Alzheimer’s, dementia and other diseases that have traditionally been taboo to speak on.\n“This is (Donnelly’s) third year doing this event, and it has just continued to grow and it’s really bringing awareness around something that just has been a stigma to so many people,” she said. “Just because you hear the word ‘Alzheimer’s’ or you hear the word ‘dementia’ does mean that you’re no longer alive. That’s not true. What that means is that people come to gather and help understand how we can further advance this mission with research and really provide some type of education and awareness around this cause.”\nAccording to data from the Alzheimer’s Association, roughly 62,500 Mississippians over age 65, approximately 12.5%, have the disease. It is the seventh highest cause of death in the state and accounts for more than $600 million in medicaid spending annually.\nMississippi also ranks sixth in highest number of hours per caregiver, with 175 million unpaid hours of care provided by 93,000 caregivers each year. The unpaid care represents a value of more than $2.3 billion.\nDonnelly, who got involved with the Alzheimer’s Association as a volunteer, said it’s easy to feel helpless and frustrated caring for someone with Alzheimer’s, but Paint the Plaza Purple is a way to fight back on behalf of those suffering from the disease.\n“You just sit there, and you just watch, and you watch, and you feel helpless, you feel guilty,” he said. “Tonight, we’re going to kick back a little bit, and we get to punch it back.”\nBringing awareness and educating the public about Alzheimer’s, dementia and other diseases is crucial, Bennett said. Unfortunately, Mississippi leads the nation in mortality from Alzheimers, she said, which means it’s even more important to bring awareness and understanding about the disease into the public light.\nEducating the public to notice warning signs and giving them the tools to have tough conversations with their loved ones is what Tuesday’s event is all about, she said.\n“The more and more that we can have the conversation with individuals that we love the most, the more awareness that we can bring to this disease,” she said.\nFor more information about The Alzheimer’s Association, its efforts or how to get involved, visit alz.org.

    "title": "'We Outside Summer' in full swing for East Harlem NYCHA center",
    "text": "How New York City’s youngsters avoid the “summer slide” during the big city’s sweltering months will shape their future. It can be a time idly wasted sitting on street corners, when young people can’t find work or other opportunities to occupy their time, or it can be employed with a flurry of inspiration, education, and activity toward long-term purpose and fond memories.\nThis year, Mayor Eric Adams’ “We Outside Summer” safety plan increased weekend hours for select NYCHA community facilities. Even with these added hours, youngsters still found themselves waiting with excitement for the doors to open each day at East Harlem’s James Weldon Johnson Community Center, said social media manager Deleah Watts.\nA quick tour from program director Rob Clarke shows exactly why. The community center remains alive even after dusk as the preteens of Pretty Problem bust a move for their hip-hop dance class while young men in the gym next door rest from lifting weights, sheepishly preparing for their photo after hearing about a media visit.\nMeanwhile, “Coach D” preaches teamwork as teenage girls run basketball drills on a full-sized court as “Hanshi” Dave Thomas demonstratively hip-tosses a purple belt in a backstage makeshift dojo for a multigenerational karate class once taken by a student’s mom more than two decades ago — all under one roof in El Barrio.\nIn May, Mayor Adams announced $2 million toward 400 hours of programming in hopes of keeping youngsters safe and busy during the summer, including extended weekend hours from 12 to 3 p.m. for certain Cornerstone community centers like Johnson. Regular operating hours run from 6 to 11 p.m. daily.\nCornerstone operates out of the NYC Department of Youth & Community Development (DYCD) in 100 public housing community centers across the city through nonprofit partners. Youth service provider SCAN-Harbor runs the programming at Johnson Community Center. Many participants and employees, like Watts, stem from the Johnson Houses.\n“I feel like I’m more connected to them because I know their parents and everything,” said Watts. “So I feel like I’m really involved because I was once a kid here too, and then I got a job here and I started working here. I grew up here, so a lot of the parents [and] the grandparents know me. A lot of the kids are comfortable with me [because] one day that’s going to be them.”\n22-year-old Isaiah McCants hails from the Bronx but Clarke’s mentorship program for young men drew him to Johnson. He began working at the center through DYCD’s Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) but later landed a standalone job handling a wide range of responsibilities like security and program application.\nThrough Johnson, McCants — who the kids call Mr. Zay — kickstarted his own basketball tournament for the community called “Make Harlem Great Again.”\n“We got teams from all over Harlem, all under one gym,” said McCants. “Just to make a safe space for young Black people — all races as well — everybody gets together [to] have a safe space to play basketball.”\nWhile it won’t translate to the court, he seemed to grow a foot taller recalling the tournament’s roots. McCants hopes efforts to provide a safe space from the streets will carry back over to making the streets safer. Clarke jokingly called him “Commissioner Z” and credited him for bringing together youngsters and their guests from all over the neighborhood under one gym roof as neutral ground for different housing developments, some with prior histories.\n“A lot of places deny spectators saying they don’t want the unknown happening or someone [who isn’t] a participant coming into the space,” said Clarke. “But we welcome it because we command a different respect…and everyone honors and respects the space.”\nAubrielle, 11, says the center’s open doors make her “so happy.” “It inspires me to come here,” she said. “Just [an] open mind, talk to teachers, dance [and] to let out my feelings.”\nJailah, 14, just got her first paycheck working at the center thanks to SYEP. She points to her hair when asked about where her money went.\nAnthony Posada, supervising attorney of Legal Aid Society’s Community Justice Unit, encountered Johnson Community Center a few years back as a teaching artist for arts nonprofit Project Attica. He recounts a “vibrant and cohesive” hub, which the public defender sees as true public safety.\n“Community safety often is a combination of factors, but at the core [are] resources,” said Posada. “In this case, community members knew they could partake of these sessions [like] pilates, after school programming … a community meeting that was taking place to address either a recent or ongoing issue that tenants wanted to focus on [or] food distribution — all these are resources [and] things communities need to meet their basic needs. And that provides safety.”\nDuring the tour, Clarke pointed to work-in-progress facilities like a new games room and computer lab in Knicks orange and blue thanks to donations from Madison Square Garden Company. McCants mentions LGBTQ programming, with ballroom culture like voguing. “We have a space for them,” he said. The center also boasts a small outdoor amphitheater and senior programming. Clarke even showed off renovated bathrooms, a luxury in Manhattan.\n“I was born and raised in East Harlem,” said Clarke. “There’s opportunities out there, but a lot of people don’t know about opportunities. Then we say we don’t have these resources — the resource is information. We got to make sure that these kids have the information, the kids, the parents, the grandparents, the younger kids: getting the information out there is the resource.”",
