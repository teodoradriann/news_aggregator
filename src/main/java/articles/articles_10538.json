    "text": "4Nu9Zhg1dr1 tech.huanqiu.com article 美国联邦法官驳回马斯克请求，OpenAI指控其“持续骚扰”案进入新阶段 /e3pmh164r/e3pmtmdvg 【环球网科技综合报道】8月14日消息，据外媒报道，美国加利福尼亚州奥克兰联邦法院周二驳回特斯拉首席执行官埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）试图驳回OpenAI反诉的请求，裁定这起涉及人工智能领域核心利益的法律纠纷需继续推进。\nOpenAI在声明中重申，马斯克自2018年退出公司后，对其发起了一场“长达数年的骚扰运动”，包括通过媒体攻击、散布不实信息及干扰公司运营，旨在拖慢其发展并夺取对领先AI技术的控制权。\n据悉，马斯克于2015年联合创立OpenAI，初衷是打造“非营利性、开源的AI研究机构以造福人类”，并承诺捐赠10亿美元资金。然而，2018年因与OpenAI管理层在发展方向上产生严重分歧——马斯克试图掌控公司运营被拒后，他宣布退出董事会，并停止后续资金支持。此时，OpenAI正面临训练AI模型所需的巨额计算成本压力，被迫于2019年转型为“利润上限”的营利性实体，并接受微软10亿美元投资。\n2022年ChatGPT的爆发式成功，彻底点燃了马斯克与OpenAI的矛盾。他多次公开指责OpenAI背离初心，从“开源非营利”转向“闭源营利”，并与微软形成垄断联盟。2024年，马斯克正式起诉OpenAI及其首席执行官萨姆·奥尔特曼（Sam Altman），要求法院禁止其将技术授权给微软，并认定GPT-4等模型构成“人工通用智能（AGI）”，超出授权范围。OpenAI则反诉马斯克存在骚扰行为，指控其通过控制的社交媒体平台X（原推特）发动舆论战，向2亿粉丝传播虚假信息，甚至试图以974亿美元低价收购公司以干扰其发展。\n周二的裁决由美国联邦法官伊冯·冈萨雷斯·罗杰斯（Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers）作出。她指出，马斯克未能提供足够证据证明OpenAI的转型违反法律，但其对OpenAI的持续攻击行为“可能构成不正当竞争和商业诽谤”。\n随着法院驳回马斯克的驳回请求，案件预计将在2026年春季进入陪审团审判阶段。与此同时，xAI与OpenAI的竞争持续升级：xAI计划于2026年推出带显示屏的智能音箱，而OpenAI被曝正在研发下一代模型Q*，其能力可能接近AGI。（青山）",

    "text": "Firefighters help move resident inside during cold snap The College Station Fire Department went above and beyond Monday during the first cold snap of 2024 COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) - The College Station Fire Department went above and beyond Monday during the first cold snap of 2024. Firefighters were called to a house in College Station to help move Jack, a 150-pound, 24-year-old African spurred tortoise from his shed outside into the warmth of a home. Laura Adair’s family has had Jack since he was a baby and was only the size of a silver dollar. She said they moved him inside during the February 2021 freeze and made improvements to his habitat outside since then, but wanted to err on the side of caution. “We made his shelter more winter-proof this time but just with it being so much colder than it usually is we started kind of overthinking and wanted to move him inside so that he was for sure warmer,” Adair said. With the help of a recycling bin, firefighters were able to load Jack up from his pen in the backyard and get him inside.

    "text": "Liam Payne Came ‘Close to Death’ Several Times Due to His Drug Usage, Claims Friend Tomás Mier Fri, December 20, 2024 at 12:48 AM UTC 6 min read\nLiam Payne on Jan. 21, 2023 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. - Credit: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images/Atlantis The Royal Liam Payne’s drug usage brought him “close to death” multiple times months before his fatal fall in October, according to his friend Roger Nores.\nIn a 91-page filing obtained by Rolling Stone Thursday, Nores — who is accused of abandonment followed by death — described the alleged depth of Payne’s drug abuse, which he claims led to several hospitalizations, multiple rehab center visits, and two resuscitations in just the last two years.\nMore from Rolling Stone\nLuigi Mangione Faces Federal Murder, Stalking Charges Over CEO Killing\nLiam Payne Fans Call for Justice in Singer's Death Investigation at Argentina March\nLiam Payne Investigation: Judge Probes Hotel Workers for Possible 'Wrongful Death'\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Last week, a judge called for an “indagatoria,” which requires suspects in a case to be questioned as part of the investigation. Suspects are not required to respond to questioning, and can submit written responses, as Nores did Wednesday. It is not a deposition. The document — which includes Nores’ version of events, and screenshots of conversations with people close to the former One Direction member — was filed by Nores to support his defense to the charge of abandonment of a person, followed by death.\n“I was a friend who loved him very much, who helped him selflessly in everything I could, who spent my own money to help him, and even then it was not enough,” writes Nores in Spanish in the document obtained by Rolling Stone . “I do not consider that I deserve the accusation that is being leveled at me.”\nIn the filing, Nores claims that Payne was in and out of rehabilitation centers in Europe and the United States in the months leading up to his death, that he consumed heroin, and that his usage of substances nearly killed him several times.\nIn one instance, in September 2023, Nores alleges that Payne “suffered from a severe intoxication that left him close to death,” and that he was hospitalized for three days in Milan. He claims that at the time, Payne was forced to cancel a Latin American tour because of the incident and his subsequent visit to a rehab center. (Payne had canceled the tour that August due to a “ bad kidney infection .”)\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Because of his addictions, Payne continued to attend rehab centers of his own free will in an attempt to overcome them,” the statement contends. “Unfortunately, these treatments were not successful and his addiction worsened as he began to use harder drugs, such as heroin.”\nNores claims that Payne was hospitalized twice again in London in late 2023, and was taken to a hospital in an ambulance due to his “high levels of intoxication,” where he had to be resuscitated. “Professionals had to resort to resuscitation maneuvers to save his life, without his family or friends being able to do anything to avoid these situations or help him,” Nores alleges.\nNores claims that Payne’s drug issues continued to worsen at the beginning of 2024, and that Payne entered a rehabilitation facility in Spain in March. Payne left the rehab center before completing treatment and returned to consuming drugs, Nores claims. Payne then allegedly had to be resuscitated again following a near overdose the following month.\n“Liam suffered a new relapse in his addiction, so he was again taken to the hospital in serious condition, and the professionals had to resort to resuscitation maneuvers to save his life,” Nores claims. He further alleges that after this incident, Payne’s father attempted to admit him to a psychiatric treatment center, but that Payne opposed the idea.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Wisconsin school shooter was in contact with a California man accused of planning separate attack, report says CNN Passengers panic as American Airlines flight ‘floods’ in midair: ‘New fear unlocked’ NY Post Ex-Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson facing warrants for arrest in Texas USA TODAY Sports Highest-earning NYPD cop with OT-fueled $400,000 salary retires following Daily News exposé NY Daily News Since he was not legally required to stay there, Payne checked himself out of the hospital and returned to the United States to seek help for his drug addiction, Nores claims. The filing contends that Payne’s family and friends allowed him to do drugs the day before he left for the States to “avoid that he become violent.” (The document does not specify the exact timeline of his return to the United States.)\nNores maintains that Payne did not consume drugs that summer, including during a trip to Argentina when Payne went to a Louis Tomlinson show in South America. However, by the start of August, Nores claims that he and Payne had a “strong argument” where he discouraged Payne from returning to Manchester, England, because Nores could tell that Payne had started using drugs again.\nIn an Aug. 23 email obtained by Rolling Stone , Nores writes to Payne’s attorney and father Geoff that he is “really concerned for his well-being” in the United Kingdom. “I hope you can bring professional doctors to check on his health regularly as soon as possible as I did while he was out in the US,” Nores wrote. “I am going to stay fully out of the picture and disconnected from now on and I wish you all the best with Liam’s health and career.”\nReps for Payne’s family in Argentina and the United Kingdom did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone ‘s request for comment on Nores’ filing. Nores did not comment.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Nores’ “abandonment followed by death” charge accuses him of leaving Payne while knowing that he was unable to care for himself and/or that he wasn’t in his right mind. For said charge, Nores could face five to 15 years in prison. In Wednesday’s filing, Nores maintains that he was not his doctor, lawyer, or representative, and claims that when he left Payne at the hotel the day he died, he was “greeting fans” and seemed to be fine. (He told TMZ that he was “playful” and in “good spirits.”)\nIn the document, Nores pivots blame to the hotel staff for carrying Payne’s body to his room where there was more of a risk of death. According to a 911 call, the reception head claimed the musician had been “breaking everything in his room” prior to the fatal fall. “If Liam had not been brought into the room by force, and had been left in the lobby and a doctor had been called while they saw him convulsing, none of this would have happened,” reads the filing.\nAlong with Nores, the other four people charged in the case responded to indagatorias. Next, the judge must determine whether the defendants should be further prosecuted, dropped from the case, or if there isn’t evidentiary support for either decision.\nPayne died at the age of 31 of multiple traumas and internal bleeding after falling from the third-floor balcony of the CasaSur Palermo hotel on Oct. 16 . In November, prosecutors identified alcohol, cocaine, and a prescribed antidepressant in Payne’s system at the time of his death, according to a toxicology report. Many questions still loom about what led to his death.\nAdvertisement Advertisement On Saturday, Payne’s fans held a march in Buenos Aires calling for significant and timely advances in the investigation. The gathering spawned after an image leaked online, which appeared to show Payne being carried by three hotel workers back to his room, allegedly mere minutes before he fell.\nBest of Rolling Stone\nThe 50 Greatest Eminem Songs\nAll 274 of Taylor Swift's Songs, Ranked\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\nSign up for RollingStone's Newsletter .

    "text": "Nvidia, maître incontesté de l'IA générative, a cette étrange faculté de transformer des événements historiques ou géopolitiques en un simple bruit de fond. Nvidia n'a pas que le pouvoir d'augmenter la puissance des supercalculateurs sur lesquels repose l'IA « générative » ; elle a aussi le pouvoir de reléguer les réunions de la Fed au rang d'un banal rituel – où elle se contente de confirmer ce que les marchés veulent entendre – et les guerres dans le monde à un simple bruit de fond, comme si un voisin un peu sourd visionnait Apocalypse Now sur son home cinéma avec les « basses » à fond les ballons.\nParfois, les murs tremblent un peu… mais ce n'est qu'un film après tout, et à la fin, le Pentagone finit par faire éliminer le colonel Kurtz, l'une de ses créatures les plus douées dans l'art de la guerre, mais devenu une sorte de démiurge échappant à tout contrôle.\nLa morale du film est que les « déviants » ont toute leur place dans les projets belliqueux des Etats-Unis, tant qu'ils obéissent au doigt et à l'oeil et ne tentent pas de s'émanciper de l'Oncle Sam.\nCertains vont se dire que cette digression nous éloigne un peu de la thématique « Nvidia »… mais c'était prévisible, puisque la publication de ses trimestriels ce 20 novembre se solde par un non-événement, donc cela ne va pas bouleverser Wall Street d'ici le week-end.\nD'autres se diront que je tente une sorte de parallèle entre le colonel Kurtz et Wolodimir Zelensky, qui décide de « balancer tout ce qu'il a sous la main » sur les Russes (des missiles ATACMS, des Storm Shadow, et demain peut-être des « Scalps »), parce qu'il s'est cru autorisé à le faire par article de presse interposé (le New York Times faisant état d'un feu vert de Joe Biden pour des « frappes en profondeur »).\nMais la réalité – et donc le vrai souci –, c'est que personne n'est capable de prouver que ces paroles ont été prononcées par le commandant en chef, c'est-à-dire le président américain.\nPas une seule vidéo, pas un « son », pas un document paraphé de sa main, pas un seul témoin « officiel ». Concrètement et légalement, le « feu vert » de Biden n'existe pas (en revanche, l'autorisation…\nPhilippe Béchade",

    "text": "DOJ investigation of Phoenix Police Department finds civil rights violations, dysfunction Jun 13, 2024, 10:46 AM | Updated: 2:01 pm (Screenshot and Facebook Photo/Phoenix Police Department) PHOENIX – A yearslong U.S. Department of Justice investigation of the Phoenix Police Department found patterns of egregious civil rights violations, officials announced Thursday. [The DOJ found](https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1355866/dl?inline=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) that the department regularly used unjustified excessive force, unlawfully detained people experiencing homelessness, targeted minorities, violated rights of protesters and discriminated against people with behavioral health disabilities, according to Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke. “Ultimately, our findings reveal evidence showing longstanding dysfunction at the Phoenix Police Department,” Clarke said during a livestreamed press conference. “The problems at their core reflect a lack of effective supervision, training and accountability.” Conduct by the police department and city violated the Constitution’s first, fourth and 14th amendments, according to Clarke. “We have also identified violations of the Safe Streets Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act,” she said. It’s the first time the DOJ found a pattern of police discrimination against people experiencing homelessness, Clarke said, and the second time where Native Americans were targeted. What happens next for Phoenix Police Department? As far as consequences go, Clarke said the DOJ will negotiate with city officials to determine what actions will be taken. “We appreciate that the city has committed to engage in continued conversation with the Department of Justice about next steps,” she said. However, she noted that a consent decree is the vehicle usually used in such cases to advance police reform. While Clarke warned that the process won’t be fast or easy, she said it can be done through “collaboration, partnership and cleared-eyed realism about the solutions that can achieve change.” [City officials have said](https://ktar.com/story/5557006/phoenix-police-department-pushes-doj-on-resolution-method-for-civil-rights-investigation/) they intend to fight against the oversight of a consent decree, arguing it would create restrictions that impede ongoing reform efforts. “Just a few moments ago, at the same time as the public, the city of Phoenix received the federal government’s findings report,” Mayor Kate Gallego said in a statement. “The City Council will meet this month — in executive session on June 25 — to receive legal advice, better understand the report, and discuss next steps. I will carefully and thoroughly review the findings before making further comment.” When did DOJ investigation of Phoenix Police begin? The [DOJ first announced](https://ktar.com/story/4610838/department-of-justice-opens-civil-rights-investigation-of-phoenix-police/) it would launch the investigation in August 2021. The city [created a website](https://www.phoenix.gov/police/doj) to keep the public informed about the probe, including details about reform measures. Clarke said the investigation covered 2016-22 and also included data from 2023 and 2024. She commended the department’s ongoing reform efforts under interim Chief Michael Sullivan but said more needs to be done. “We are committed to fair and equitable policing in this police department and we work very, very hard to make sure that occurs every single day,” Sullivan told KTAR News 92.3 FM’s The Mike Broomhead Show shortly after the findings were released. [Sullivan was hired](https://ktar.com/story/5176931/phoenix-names-interim-police-chief-to-lead-department-through-doj-investigation/) in 2022 to lead the department through the investigation after [former Chief Jeri Williams announced her retirement](https://ktar.com/story/5038547/phoenix-police-chief-jeri-williams-to-retire-from-post-this-summer/). What steps have been taken to reform Phoenix Police Department? “To the city and police department’s credit, during our investigation they have taken preliminary steps to institute reform,” Clarke said during Tuesday’s press conference. “Interim Chief Sullivan revised the department’s use of force policy and introduced new training on de-escalation and the duty to intervene.” Clarke also cited [Phoenix’s investments](https://ktar.com/story/5576753/phoenix-to-add-790-new-shelter-beds-to-address-homelessness-crisis/) in shelters and resources for people experiencing homelessness. “And the department has developed additional policies and training to guide 911 call takers in appropriately responding to requests for emergency assistance involving people with behavioral health disabilities,” she said. However, it hasn’t been enough to satisfy the DOJ. “Many reforms have not yet been implemented,” Clarke said. “Other reforms exist on paper, but not in practice. In total, these efforts are simply not enough to address the full scope of our findings.” The Phoenix civil rights investigation is one of 11 opened against police departments since April 2021, [the DOJ said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-civil-rights-violations-phoenix-police-department-and-city-phoenix).
