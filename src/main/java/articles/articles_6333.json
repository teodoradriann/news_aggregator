    "text": "No more spilling the tea about your toxic partner to your friends?\nIn today’s world, many young people are finding it harder to deal with emotions like love and anger. Social media has also contributed to this by making people more open and exposed, which can sometimes leave them feeling even more confused.\nTo help students handle such issues better, Delhi University (DU) is introducing a new elective course called “Negotiating Intimate Relationships”.\nALSO READ |\nCan separate homes keep love alive? The ‘living apart together’ trend explained\nThe course, designed by DU’s Department of Psychology, is meant to help young adults deal with emotional struggles in today’s digital world.\nIt will be available for undergraduate students from the 2025-26 academic year, no matter what subject they are studying. Passing the Class 12 board exams is a must to take the course.\nBut what will the course offer students? How will it support them? What topics will it focus on? What kind of discussions will take place in class?\nLet’s get you these answers:\nCourse structure and key points\nThis four-credit course is designed to help students spot red flags, handle emotional challenges, and build strong, respectful relationships.\nIt will focus on how young people form and manage close friendships and romantic ties.\nStudents can take this course alongside their core subjects It aims to open up space for conversations that usually do not happen in formal classrooms.\nHere’s how the course is structured:\nUnit 1: Understanding the psychology of friendships and close relationships\nUnit 2: Exploring different theories of love and sexuality, including Robert Sternberg’s triangular theory of love and the two-factor theory\nUnit 3: Recognising danger signs such as jealousy, emotional pressure, and intimate partner violence\nUnit 4: Learning how to build strong, lasting, and supportive relationships\nWhy has this course been introduced?\nThe course comes in response to growing worries about the emotional struggles faced by young adults, The Times of India reported. Social media and the lack of early lessons on healthy relationships are making things harder.\nRecent events in Delhi have brought this issue into focus. Between May and June 2025, three young women, aged between their late teens and early twenties, were killed by jealous partners.\nWhile these incidents did not all involve students, experts believe they point to a deeper problem: many young people do not know how to cope with rejection, relationship stress, or emotional conflict.\nAccording to the course outline, its main goal is to help students understand the basics of close relationships, notice emotional stress points, and learn how to form meaningful, respectful connections.\nBy the end of the course, students should be able to understand the emotional and psychological roots of love and pain and use that knowledge to handle real-life situations better.\nThe university says this kind of academic support is becoming more important, especially as more young people struggle with emotional and relationship-related issues.\nALSO READ |\nWhat is solo polyamory? How is it different from traditional polyamory?\nHow many classes will be held? What will be discussed?\nStudents will attend three lectures and one tutorial each week.\nThe course is meant to be engaging and hands-on. Students will look into their own social media habits, join in exercises to better understand themselves, and talk about common challenges in relationships.\nClassroom discussions will cover a range of topics, including online dating, how people handle forgiveness, and how love and conflict are shown in popular films. For instance, students will study partner violence as shown in ‘Kabir Singh’ and idealised love in ‘Titanic’.\nThese conversations will help students think critically about how films and media shape our ideas of love and relationships. They will also debate modern dating culture and explore how platforms like Instagram or dating apps influence behaviour and expectations.\nLatika Gupta, a Delhi University faculty member, told The Times of India, “Films reflect how love is often idealised or even normalised when it’s toxic. But when analysed in a classroom, they can become powerful tools to deconstruct unhealthy patterns.”\nShe also pointed out that young people are rarely taught how to cope with rejection or draw boundaries. “If we learn this early, some of the tragedies wouldn’t happen,” she said.\nStudents will also use tools like Sternberg’s triangular love scale to explore the different parts of relationships and understand how they function.",

    "text": "Getty Images Tragedy struck in the life of Denver Broncos Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway on Wednesday. Jeff Sperbeck -- Elway's longtime friend, business partner and former agent -- died from injuries suffered when falling from a golf cart reportedly driven by Elway, according to ESPN .\nThe Riverside County (California) coroner confirmed Sperback's death in a press release from the sheriff's office . Sperbeck suffered injuries Saturday in La Quinta, California, and he was ruled dead Wednesday at a Palm Spring hospital. He was 62.\n\"I am absolutely devastated and heartbroken by the passing of my close friend, business partner and agent Jeff Sperbeck,\" Elway said Wednesday in a statement ( via ESPN ). \"There are no words to truly express the profound sadness I feel with the sudden loss of someone who has meant so much to me. My heart and deepest sympathies go out to Jeff's wife, Cori; his children Carly, Sam and Jackson; and everyone who knew and loved him. Jeff will be deeply missed for the loyalty, wisdom, friendship and love he brought into my life and the lives of so many others.\"\nTMZ reported that Elway was the driver of the golf cart when Sperbeck fell and hit his head on asphalt. The incident is still under investigation by the Riverside County Sherriff's office. TMZ reported that there were no indications that Elway was driving inadequately when Sperbeck fell.\nSperbeck began representing Elway halfway through his 16-year NFL career in 1990. He also represented over 100 NFL players in a career spanning three decades as an agent and business advisor.\nElway won the 1987 NFL MVP award in addition to consecutive Super Bowl titles to end his career in 1998 and 1999. He also won a Super Bowl as the general manger of the Broncos in 2015. Sperbeck helped run Elway's business enterprises, which include restaurants, a winery and car dealerships.\nOur Latest NFL Stories NFL fifth-year option tracker: Decisions on 2022 class Shanna McCarriston • 1 min read Report: Bills signing former second-round WR Bryan DeArdo • 1 min read Henry Ruggs III trains in prison in hopes of NFL return Garrett Podell • 2 min read 2025 NFL Draft: Best pick made by all 32 teams Chris Trapasso • 14 min read Former SB champion HC shares one skill QBs must have Bryan DeArdo • 3 min read Kelce brothers talk NFL Draft, give advice to rookies Shanna McCarriston • 3 min read Now Playing Share Share Video Link copied!

    "text": "LORANGER, La. ( WVUE /Gray News) - Authorities in Louisiana say one of two missing children has been found dead while the other was found alive and well. The Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office reported the recovery of 3-year-old Erin Brunett’s body Thursday afternoon. Her 6-year-old sister, Jalie Brunett, was found alive and well. The suspect, Daniel Callihan, was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi. Police found the 6-year-old alive in Mississippi, with Callihan, according to authorities. Erin’s body was a few yards from where her sister was found alive. She was taken to the hospital for treatment of minor injuries. Her grandparents are on their way to Jackson to be with her. “You don’t want to see that as a police chief; you don’t want to see that as a father,” said Chief Joseph Wade from the Jackson Police Department. “A coward took this child from her family.” The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Jackson Police Department are also involved in the investigation. The Louisiana State Police issued an Amber Alert for the two children after finding their mother dead early Thursday morning. According to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office, 35-year-old Callie Brunett was missing for over 24 hours before being found found “brutally” slain in her home on North Cooper Road. Her death is being investigated as a homicide. Her two small children, 6-year-old Jalie and 3-year-old Erin were “unaccounted for,” Sheriff Daniel Edwards said. Edwards said Brunett was reported missing Tuesday and because her car was not at her house, her family did not believe she was home. Thursday morning, her father made entry into her home and discovered her body and her children missing. The manner of Brunett’s death was not disclosed, but Edwards said there was “blood everywhere.” Copyright 2024 WVUE via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

Ojalá algún día el PSOE vuelva a ser un partido de izquierdas, republicano y laico.\n[#11](c11#c-11) No descartéis la opción de que la gente deje de votar al PSOE para votar a partidos de izquierdas.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Cuando eso pase, se pueden olvidar de volver a ganar unas elecciones. Se habla mucho de la culpa del PSOE en esto de la iglesia, pues no, la culpa es de sus votantes y sus líderes lo saben. Si hubiese una gran mayoría declarada de votantes anti privilegios de la iglesia, mañana mismo Pdr sacaba una ley.\n[#19](c19#c-19) argumento d cardenales y obispos, prefieren a ateos antes que a tibios. Por algo será.\nDo you me entiendes?\n[#29](c29#c-29) también hay bebidas blancas que no son leche. Pero la estadística está ahí, la gran mayoría de los actos y propaganda contra clínicas abortistas son de organizaciones católicas. Tipo Hazte oír o abogados cristianos.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Yo soy ateo y el aborto lo veo ético en limitados casos, por ejemplo que peligre la vida de la madre, violaciones, malformaciones del feto y similares\nAunque tampoco es que esté a favor de esas pintadas\n[#1](c1#c-1) Muy sencillo, esas clínicas ponen un letrero que son israelíes y que están abortando niños palestinos, y los de la Iglesia le hacen la ola:\n\"Estamos buscando bebés pero ya no quedan\" [#2](c2#c-2) hay una sutil diferencia:\n- en todas las iglesias no se follan a niños porque no todos los curas son iguales, del mismo modo que no todos los hombres son violadores solo por ser hombres.\n- en todas las clinicas de aborto se practican abortos, del mismo modo que en todas las tiendas de juguetes se venden juguetes.\nEsto quiere decir que en el caso de las pintadas a tiendas de juguetes siempre tendrían razón al pintarles pinta-juguetes, aunque esté feo pintar y en tus supuestas pintadas no tendrías razon en muchos casos.\n[#13](c13#c-13) Siguiendo con las sutilezas:\n- \"mata niños\"es erróneo porque los embriones no son niños.\n- \"asesinos\" es erróneo porque el embrión no es una persona.\n[#15](c15#c-15) buena sutileza manida la de deshumanizar. A ver, ¿cuando comienza algo a ser persona? Y ser humano? Solo respetas las vidas de las personas o tambien la de los seres humanos?\n[#56](c56#c-56) por lo mismo que un niño no es un adulto.\nPodrías haber elegido un mejor simil para aclarar, pero has oscurecido el tema, excepto si quien lo lee ya esta de acuerdo contigo y lo interpreta de cualquier forma. En tal caso, no sé para qué te diriges a mi mensaje.\n[#13](c13#c-13) \"Encubridores de pederastas\", \"Hipócritas\", \"Vividores\", \"Cínicos\" es pintable en todas las iglesias.\n[#13](c13#c-13) Permíteme que corrija el primer punto.\nTal vez no se abusa de niños en todas las iglesias al mismo tiempo. Que ahora no se abuse de niños en la iglesia de mi barrio no significa que no se hiciera hace tiempo.\nLa totalidad de las iglesias, conventos, monasterios, etc, católicos han sido testigos en algún momento del pasado de algún tipo de abuso sobre menores, robo de bebes, connivencia con asesinos fascistas y cuantos crímenes ha cometido la iglesia católica a lo largo de su oscura historia.\nClaro que hubo y hay curas que no lo hacen. Pero un gano de arena no hace desierto...\nLo siento, no puedo con esto.\nMe cago en dios, en la virgen y me sobra mierda para cagarme en la puta madre de estos fanáticos hijos de puta.\n[#27](c27#c-27) mistico2 es como tú. Se pone en el papel de ignorado sin estarlo. Ahora te ha superado, se hace el indignado y me ignora a mi por un ignore inventado. Sois tela de graciosinfantiles. Y, por supuesto, mitad ridiculos y mitad secta.\nBesis y Feliz Navidad!!!\nEn sus medios, están generando discursos para justificarse (hasta al papa se lo ve como satánico). Se preparan complejos argumentarios en los que los derechos y libertades existen gracias a ellos y ellos son los perseguidos y martirizados (el cristianismo más que \"ellos\"). Así que haya cristianos asesinados en alguna nación, que se retiren crucifijos de centros estatales, que se les frene cuando quieren evitar abortos o imponer su ideología a todo el mundo (dicen que no es ideología sino \"un mensaje\" jeje) lo consideran persecución contra ellos igual de equiparable todo, y cada vez piden más acciones y organizarse más por una especie de cruzada que han de realizarpor ejemplo\nPor un momento, he visto enlazada esta noticia, con la que precede..... malos tiempos\n\"Estamos buscando bebés pero ya no quedan\"\nNo hay tantas clínicas de ese tipo. Hemos aprobado una ley a nivel de toda España solo para solucionar ese problema, y sin embargo sigue apareciendo recurrentemente en las noticias. ¿Es posible que algo no se haya hecho bien?\nBueno aprovecho para cagarme en la virgen y en todos sus dioses imaginarios después de esto no creo que ofendan sus sentimientos religiosos ficticios\n\"Mata niños\" y \"asesinos\"... Ahora solo falta añadir un \"Palestina Libre\" y ya irán las autoridades a dejar el muro como un cristal.\n[#45](c45#c-45) Es que ellos son los primeros en saltarse las normas de su propia religión.

    "text": "Le club du plongeur Jules Bouyer, qui est arrivé à la 8e place au JO de Paris, est menacé de fermeture car il n’a plus sa piscine à disposition à cause de travaux. Le plongeur lyonnais Jules Bouyer est arrivé à la 8e place du plongeon à 3m des JO de Paris 2024 ce jeudi 8 août. Une performance qui survient quelques jours après sa 5e place en plongeon synchronisé à 3m avec Alexis Jandard.\nS'il n'est pas parvenu à ramener une médaille de ces Jeux de Paris, le jeune plongeur de 22 ans peut déjà donner rendez-vous à ses supporters aux JO de Los Angeles en 2028.\nMalheureusement pour lui, la situation de son club est aujourd'hui difficile. La piscine de Vaise du Lyon Plongeon Club, où il s'entraîne, n'a plus de piscine à disposition pour cause de travaux.\nLes rénovations du centre aquatique doivent se terminer en mai 2025. Des travaux qui mettent en difficulté le Lyon Plongeon Club. L’association sportive essaye de préparer au mieux sa rentrée pour la saison prochaine.\n\"On est en danger\" \"C’est malheureux et paradoxal parce qu’on a un athlète qui est finaliste aux JO et en même temps, le club peut mettre la clé sous la porte dans trois mois. La ville de Lyon n’a trouvé aucun moyen de mettre un tremplin juste d’un mètre pour pouvoir conserver nos 140 adhérents\", déplore auprès de BFM Lyon, Frédéric Parot, entraîneur du club et ancien coach de Jules Bouyer.\nFaute d’installations adéquates dans les piscines aux alentours, le club va devoir s’entraîner dans le gymnase dans la halle d’athlétisme Stéphane Diagana.\n\"On est un club olympien sur la ville de Lyon. Ce n’est pas juste Jules Bouyer aujourd’hui, ça fait depuis les années 2000 qu’on a un qualifié à chaque Jeux olympique. C’est quelque chose qui dure dans le temps\", souligne Frédéric Parot.\n\"Aujourd’hui des décisions ont été prises et ça ne va pas dans notre sens. On est en danger. Je ne sais pas ce qu’on va faire, on a plein de jeunes pousses qui sont prometteuses pour l’avenir et là, on ne sait même pas ce qu’on va faire au mois de septembre\", conclut l’entraîneur.\nSur le même sujet Alexis Jandard et Jules Bouyer en bronze aux Mondiaux de Natation Mondiaux de natation: Jandard et Bouyer en bronze, première médaille pour la France JO 2024 (plongeon): \"Je préfère qu'on regarde mes sauts que mon slibard\", l’énorme buzz du maillot de bain de Jules Bouyer Des discussions sont toujours en cours entre la mairie et le club.

    "title": "Israeli tanks, missiles strike Gaza in offensive against Hamas",
    "text": "By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA (Reuters) – Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n“The task here is to dismantle Hamas – so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. “We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.”\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n“That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,” said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel’s latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 – nearly 1% of Gaza’s population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip’s dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT’S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt “to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,” Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)",
