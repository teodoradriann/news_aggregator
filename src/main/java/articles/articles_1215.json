    "text": "24/7 writing help on your phone Save to my list Remove from my list A mass shooting in California shocked the country last week, a little girl received a cancer diagnoses today, and over 100 people will die from suicide in the United States tomorrow. This is the cycle of a never ending thing called evil. Countless theologians and scholars have battled with this issue from the very beginning. “Why do bad things happen to good people?” is the question that individuals face every day. To the atheist, evil is possibly their best evidence against God. Why would a good God let all of this happen to His creation? Charles Baudelaire said, “If there is a God, he must be the Devil.” With a bit of critical thinking and the help of St. Augustine, Christians can better explain this problem of evil to both the unbeliever and the believer alike. This paper will argue that St. Augustine’s solution on the existence, power and goodness of God, despite the evil in the world, outweighs the solutions of other philosophers. The existence of evil is a non-believer’s best weapon against the idea of God. Atheists usually try to find flaws in the theist’s position instead of having any tangible evidence against God themselves, but this has one big exception. According to Ed Miller and Jon Jensen, evil is “the most notorious evidence against God.” For years Augustine struggled with the topic himself and even postponed his conversion to Christianity for quite some time. If Augustine had to seriously consider converting to Christianity, then it is imperative that one knows how to argue against the atheists so they too may one day see the truth in God. It is also important that believers themselves realize the truth behind the evil. Structurally, this paper will first discuss the problem of evil and the claims that coincide with it will be stated. After that, some of the philosophers that argue against a loving, powerful God because of evil will be brought up with their solutions. Next, St. Augustine will come in and his views on evil will be explained. Finally, the paper will evaluate why Augustine’s view is a sufficient view for the existence and goodness of God with the wickedness in the world and give a conclusion of the topic. Before this term of evil is discussed, it is important to recognize what exactly evil is. There are two main types. Miller defines natural evil as “the evil that results from natural causes,” and it includes disease, starvation, physical deformities, and numerous other “sources of underserved anguish.” The other type is moral evil, which is “the evil that results from personal depravity.” This includes the terrible acts such as murder, theft, war, and other man-created evils. Both of these terms are included in the problem of evil. So what then is this problem of evil? The problem is called “theodicy,” or the justification of God; it is God on trial. David Hume, a philosopher especially known for his skepticism and naturalism views, states the problem in a simple way: “Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?” This well-known statement can be narrowed down to three controversial claims: 1. God is omnipotent. 2. God is omnibenevolent. 3. There is evil in the world. With these claims, philosophers everywhere have tried to find solutions to this problem. One of the most popular solutions today is to recognize that we do not know God’s plan. It is far beyond our knowledge. Stephen Davis, in his book Encountering Evil, says the following: “Given what is said about God’s transcendence and our cognitive limits, we would expect that there will be evils that we cannot explain…” Even in the Bible it is said that we cannot fully understand God’s ways. “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the LORD.” Alas, while this solution would be satisfying from a religious standpoint, this is more of a philosophical issue for the sake of this paper. Leaning away from the faith side and heading towards reason, Gottfried Leibniz comes to another solution. Often identified with his work in his book Theodicy, Leibniz proposed that it is impossible for a perfect world to exist: “I do not believe that a world without evil, preferable in order to ours, is possible; otherwise it would have been preferred.” He suggests that all of the evil is ultimately for a greater good. Miller explains, “Anything created by God would have to be less than God just by virtue of being dependent on him, and this means immediately that it must be less than perfect.” If we were too perfect to need a God, there would have been no point to create us. One notable philosopher with a rather radical solution to the issue is the very influential John Stuart Mill. In his Three Essays on Religion, Mill lays out why there is evil in the world. He explains that God is not all-powerful, but does have a threshold to His power. If God were all-powerful, wouldn’t he have the ability to get rid of evil? Mill goes on to say, “[Christianity] represents [the Creator] as for some inscrutable reason tolerating the perpetual counteraction of his purposes by the will of another Being of opposite character… the Devil.” This statement not only downplays the Christian God’s omnipotence and omnibenevolence but also suggests that the Devil is to blame for evil. These are only a few of the claims made about the solution to evil. There is a whole other set of solutions that do not include a God at all, but for the sake of time, this paper will move on to the great Augustine’s theories of evil. After the authors of the New Testament, St. Augustine of the third century has probably been the most influential writer in the world. Before he became a great Christian philosopher and theologian, Augustine succumbed to the life of parties and sin. After he began to devote himself to Christ, he also devoted his life to thinking critically about his Creator’s world. Therefore, St. Augustine’s theories of the problem of evil came about. Although it has a long tradition, the privation theory of evil is mostly associated with Augustine. This theory states that evil is nothing more than the absence or privation of goodness, and God only creates things that are good. Augustine writes, “For the Almighty God, who, as even the heathen acknowledge, has supreme power over all things, being Himself supremely good, would never permit the existence of anything evil among his works.... For what is that which we call evil but the absence of good?” To put evil as a picture, it is like a rust. “Rottenness and rust do not exist in themselves but only something else as the corruption of it.” God cannot create something that is nothing; He, the absolute good, is responsible for the goodness of the world, not the nonbeing and evil. This theory allows St. Augustine to argue that God is still all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving in the face of evil. A point to be made is that God made human beings to be good, not perfect. “God saw all that he had made, and it was good…” Humans are inherently good, yet they are not perfect and are therefore open to corruption--open to rusting and dissolving God’s creation. It is also important to state that although Augustine denies evil as a substance, he more than most recognizes that it is very real. So then, where did this evil come from? This is where Augustine’s Free-Will Defense comes in. In this defense, Augustine writes in his book On Free Choice of Will about how our sin is voluntary: “Yet since this defect is voluntary, it lies within our power.” With this free will, one can take the three statements from the skeptics’ problem of evil and add one more statement to it: 1. God is omnipotent. 2. God is omnibenevolent. 3. God desires free rational agents. 4. Suffering exists. The third statement allows for a lot more flexibility with this issue. In order for God to be all-loving while being all-powerful, he wanted to make beings that could make real decisions instead of Him being a master puppeteer. With this free will, humans have the ability to do what they want with the world--good or bad. Augustine describes the cause of our evil as having disordered loves. We are creatures with desires, and God intended these desires to be in a certain order-- God first, others second, ourselves third, and things last. Augustine confessed to disordering these loves himself in his Confessions by saying, “Because my will was perverse it changed to lust, and lust yielded to become habit, and habit not resisted became necessity.” When we put anything before God, we are subject to sin. God is the only unmovable thing in the universe! Therefore, one cannot blame the Devil for the evil in this world; it is humans who are to blame. How do we get rid of evil? We have to get rid of ourselves, but obviously God is not quite ready for that. The other philosophers bring up some interesting suggestions, but all of them ultimately fail because they do not have the adequate explanations for the problem of evil. St. Augustine explains that evil and suffering can take place in the world, even with a loving and powerful God. God is not the cause of suffering, and it was never His intention for evil to take place in the world. However, evil is present because of the fact that God made the world to be good, not perfect and because God gave us the right to free will. Evil is not a thing or being, but is actually the “Privation of Good” as St. Augustine tells us. When we think of evil as an absence of good, it makes sense that there will be instances of the corruption of good in this imperfect world. The presence of evil in the world is one of the biggest problems Christianity faces. Christians and non-Christians both ask, “How can all this evil and suffering take place if God is who He says He is? He knows what is happening, and He loves us, and He is powerful enough to make it stop.” As non-Christians, it may be easy to ignore that God is all of those things, but as Christians, we must accept that God is powerful, knowing, and loving. Therefore, when people come to us with these questions, we must be able to defend God in the face of evil with a well-formulated response. St. Augustine lays out this response and gives us a solution that we can validly argue. This solution still allows God to be omnipotent and omnibenevolent and explains how evil can come about in light of all this. The works of St. Augustine are trustworthy because the presences of evil was a topic that bothered him for much of his life. He spent many years trying to work out a solution that would allow him to believe in God even with the existence of evil; many would say he did exceptionally well in bringing the situation to light in the 4th century, 2015, and every year in between. 👋 Hi!

    "text": "EFE Latam Israel sigue su ofensiva en Gaza mientras parece no tener aún un plan claro a medio plazo Leer todo el artículo Agencia EFE 29 de diciembre de 2023, 12:33 a. m. · 4 min de lectura\nJerusalén, 28 dic (EFE).- El Ejército israelí siguió este jueves con su ofensiva en Gaza, donde continúan los duros combates con Hamás y aumentan los muertos, en un contexto en que Israel asume que sus operaciones irán por largo y debe comenzar a planear un escenario a medio plazo.\nMientras Hamás va difundiendo videos donde se ve a sus milicias haciendo emboscadas y atacando tropas y tanques israelíes, el Ejército continúa realizando operaciones en el norte, centro y sur de la Franja, entre ellas en la urbe meridional de Jan Yunis, donde las fuerzas israelíes \"llevan a cabo misiones sin precedentes\", dijo este jueves el ministro de Defensa israelí, Yoav Gallant.\n\"Nuestras fuerzas llegan a zonas en las que nunca antes habíamos estado, tomando salas de control y eliminando a terroristas\", añadió Gallant, durante una visita en el cuartel general de la División 98, cuerpo militar que combate ahora en el área de Jan Yunis.\nA su vez, las tropas intensifican su incursión militar en el área sur de la Franja, operación que iniciaron semanas atrás, centrándose también ahí en alcanzar \"los centros de mando, depósitos de armas e instalaciones de producción\" de armamento de las milicias.\nTodo ello, reiteró Gallant, con \"la tarea de desmantelar a Hamás para que ya no tenga capacidad militar ni de Gobierno\", fin para el que las fuerzas israelíes deberán demostrar \"mucha perseverancia y determinación\".\nDesde el inicio de la invasión terrestre en Gaza el 27 de octubre, al menos 167 soldados israelíes han muerto, mientras que la cifra de militares -tanto activos como reservistas- fallecidos desde el ataque de Hamás del pasado 7 de octubre superó este jueves los 500.\nTodo ello, mientras los ataques y bombardeos de Israel siguieron causando en las últimas horas cientos de muertos palestinos, que son más de 21.300 en los más de dos meses y medio de ofensiva, a lo que se añade una crisis humanitaria causada por el duro cerco israelí sobre Gaza, que la ha dejado con gran escasez de alimentos, recursos esenciales, medicamentos, agua potable o gasolina para electricidad.\nContinuar leyendo la historia Según la agencia oficial de noticias Wafa, decenas de gazatíes murieron este jueves debido a bombardeos sobre viviendas en el sur de Gaza, área donde se concentran gran parte de los 1,9 millones de desplazados internos en el enclave.\nEn la urbe de Rafah, punto más meridional del enclave, \"al menos 20 ciudadanos murieron y decenas resultaron heridos como resultado de un bombardeo israelí que tuvo como objetivo una casa\".\nLos aviones de combate israelíes también \"lanzaron ataques contra una casa del campo de refugiados de Shaboura\", en Rafah, que causó asimismo \"decenas de fallecidos y heridos, la mayoría mujeres y niños\", concretó Wafa. Por otro lado, más de 25 personas murieron en varios ataques sobre Jan Yunis, detalló la misma fuente.\nA su vez, entre otros incidentes, se informó de ataques en las localidades norteñas de Beit Hanún o Beit Lahia, que incluyeron también decenas de víctimas mortales, mientras las tropas israelíes siguen atacando el campo de refugiados de Al Maghazi, en la ciudad de Deir Balah, en el centro de Gaza, objeto de bombardeos casi constantes durante los últimos días.\nLos servicios médicos de la Media Luna Roja palestina informaron que sus equipos trasladaron al hospital a tres muertos y seis heridos por ataques contra una casa en el campo de Al Maghazi.\nSus equipos médicos también trabajan ahora con la Media Luna Roja de Egipto para crear un campamento para desplazados en la zona de Jan Yunis, que se espera que alcance las 1.000 tiendas de campaña.\nTodo ello se produce mientras Israel tiene que ir planeando sus actuaciones a medio plazo en Gaza, y un plan para la posguerra que por ahora no parece estar determinado, lo que genera preocupación a su principal aliado, Estados Unidos.\nJusto este jueves, el secretario de Defensa estadounidense, Lloyd Austin, habló con Gallant y discutió aspectos de \"los preparativos para la fase de estabilización que debe seguir a las operaciones de combate\", informó el Pentágono.\nLa Casa Blanca estaría presionando a Israel para que reduzca la intensidad de los ataques en Gaza, aunque Gallant dijo hace poco que estos se podrían prolongar todavía durante varios meses más.\nPor otro lado, según prensa israelí, el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, debía celebrar este jueves una reunión de su Gabinete de Guerra para abordar posibles planes para la posguerra en Gaza, pese a que finalmente canceló el encuentro, mientras el Gobierno israelí sigue sin dar detalles claros sobre quién pretende que tenga el poder en Gaza o cómo debería gestionarse su reconstrucción.\nSegún medios israelíes, Netanyahu no quiso realizar encuentros para abordar esta cuestión hasta ahora, lo que preocupa a la Administración Biden, que teme que el Ejército israelí se quede estancado dentro del enclave indefinidamente.\n(c) Agencia EFE\nMÁS POPULARES La fiesta de celebridades \"casi desnudas\" que provocó un escándalo político en Rusia BBC News Mundo · 4 min de lectura Las espeluznantes predicciones de Baba Vanga para el 2024 LA NACION · 3 min de lectura El pez invasor de 200 kilos que se alimenta de pirañas y avanza implacable por la Amazonía BBC News Mundo · 5 min de lectura Maduro volvió a arremeter contra Milei, lo tildó de “pitiyanqui y progringo” e hizo una advertencia LA NACION · 2 min de lectura Loret responde a AMLO tras vincularlo con empresas de medicinas El Universal · 1 min de lectura",

My plan is to cook my way through it this year (new year's resolution?). On page 63 there is a fantastic recipe for\nteriyaki beef bowls that is not just quick and easy, but full of Asian flavors. This ground beef recipe will be on repeat for dinner!\nTo make this\nAsian dinner you will need just a few simple ingredients. Here is your shopping list: vegetable oil, garlic, onion, carrot, zucchini, ground beef, soy sauce, mirin, cooking sake and granulated sugar. Ground beef and a few vegetables (the kids won't even know they're there) are cooked then coated in a simple four-ingredient homemade teriyaki sauce. Delicious!\nServe this tasty teriyaki ground beef over rice or Chinese noodles. This recipe is so quick and easy that you may have time to whip up some\ncrispy eggrolls or crab rangoon to serve alongside it.\nHere are a few more recipes from the cookbook:\nMagic Baked Rice(our most popular recipe of 2023) Crazy Crispy No-Oil Chicken Baked Fish Recipe With Lemon Cream Sauce\nNote: 30Seconds is a participant in the Amazon affiliate advertising program and this post contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission or fees if you make a purchase via those links.\nCuisine: Asian\nPrep Time: 8 minutes\nCook Time: 12 minutes\nTotal Time: 20 minutes\nServings: 4\nIngredients\n- 1 tablespoon\nvegetable oil\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced fine\n- 1 yellow onion, finely chopped\n- 1 carrot, peeled and grated\n- 1 zucchini, grated\n- 1 pound ground beef\nTeriyaki Sauce\n- 3 tablespoons\nsoy sauce\n- 3 tablespoons\nmirin\n- 3 tablespoons cooking sake (see Recipe Notes)\n- 1/2 teaspoon\ngranulated sugar\nHelpful Products\nRecipeTin Eats Dinner Sesame Seeds Cutting Board Chef Knife Measuring Spoons Skillet Grater Garlic Press Box Grater Chopsticks\nRecipe Notes\n- Cooking sake can be found on the beer and wine aisle at your grocery store or in Asian markets.\n- Try this recipe with ground turkey or ground chicken.\n- I used low-sodium soy sauce.\n- Magi garnishes the dish with sesame seeds. Read about the\nhealth benefits of sesame seeds!\nHere's how to make it:\n- Mix all the teriyaki sauce ingredients together in a bowl. Set aside.\n- Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the garlic and onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the carrot and zucchini and cook for another 3 minutes, or until any water in the vegetables evaporates.\n- Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned.\n- Add the teriyaki sauce and cook for about 4 minutes or until sauce evaporates into the meat and the meat is a little caramelized.\n- Serve the beef over rice or noodles.\nNutrition Facts Per Serving\nCalories: 134\nTotal Fat: 5.1g\nSaturated Fat: 1.3g\nCholesterol: 22mg\nSodium: 265mg\nTotal Carbohydrate: 12.6g\nDietary Fiber: 1.5g\nTotal Sugars: 6.8g\nProtein: 9g\nVitamin D: 0mcg\nCalcium: 21mg\nIron: 5mg\nPotassium: 290mg\nRecipe cooking times, nutritional information and servings are approximate and provided for your convenience.
