    "title": "Doesn't the Catholic Church need some serious laundry? - Nyasa Times",
    "text": "Doesn’t the Catholic Church need some serious laundry? That, right now, the Catholic Church is being spanked by its own, is not far-fetched. Thanks, of course, to the Vatican and Pope Francis’ approved novel decree that gives a go ahead for priests to bless same sex-sex couples “as long as the blessing is not connected to the ceremony of a same-sex union.” Now, the Catholic Church or the Church, mother to about 1.3 billion sons and daughters across the world, has an uphill task to remain intact because of an utterance or decree from its highest office. The office of the Supreme Pontiff—the Pope. Why? The Pope, who is the Bishop of Rome, has for the first time, to my ken, as far as the history of the Catholic Church is concerned, been disputed by some of his fellow bishops throughout the world. Here at home, for example, immediately the Holy See let out the controversial decree, the Episcopal Conference of Malawi (ECM)—the bishops conference—prohibited “blessings of any kind” for “same-sex unions of any kind.” The esteemed Malawi brother-bishops of Pope Francis “noted certain erroneous interpretations of this declaration that have generated interest, fears, and worries among Catholics and people who look up to the Catholic Church for moral, spiritual, and doctrinal guidance.” In other words, and, to a greater extent, the Malawi bishops conference lays bare the notion of confusion—serious confusion for that matter—with regard to the Vatican’s decree. In other words, like in a fistfight, millions of Catholic faithful have been beaten to pulp spiritually, morally or otherwise by the same office they hold with the utmost esteem. This confusion, I should underscore, is, not at all, a healthy phenomenon for the church. As a Catholic, I feel like it was high time the Church thought of this “confusion” as food for thought, came together and made some serious “right” decisions before the real fire broke out and made everything worse. The Church must, among others, re-think whether or not it is within the trajectory it must follow as it was in the beginning. For example, it is no longer a hidden fact that, where I come from, the sacrament of marriage is no longer as highly regarded as when I was a little boy. People dump their spouses willy-nilly and still have their new marriages blessed by the clergy without much ado. There are surely myriad anthills that the Catholic Church needs to clear and, I think, declaration “fiducia supplicans” is a blessing in disguise for the Church to engage in some serious talk. I have for, sometime now, advocated that a third Vatican Council be convoked – until recently. In August this year, Pope Francis said he believed “the time is not ripe.” He told Vatican News that it was “not even necessary at this time, since Vatican II has yet to be fully implemented.” One can perhaps argue about whether it is the ripe time or not, but then hold themselves back on the simple logic that the second Vatican Council is yet to be fully implemented. Having a third Vatican Council would be like launching a fresh strategic plan when the previous one has not yet been fully implemented. However, the Church should consider holding serious talks amongst its synods world-over, look back and contemplate seriously about its future. The third Vatican Council, you never know, would help in ironing out a battalion of the Church’s mishaps. The Church’s failure to remain steadfast on a particular decision, as has been the case with “fiducia supplicans”, unfortunately, lets its faithful fly blind and lose track. And this, I am sure, is not Pope Francis’ wish. Pope John XXIII summoned the Second Vatican Council – held for four years between 1962 to 1965 – because he felt the Church needed “updating” in an increasingly secularized world. It has been over half a century since the Church’s last update. Honestly, is it not time that the Catholic Church updates again?Follow and Subscribe Nyasa TV :",

    "text": "Othello graduation caps off years of students’ hard work\nOTHELLO – Camaraderie and cheer were in the air as the Class of 2025 took the field at Othello High School for their graduation ceremony, a momentous occasion that many expressed they worked hard to reach. Co-valedictorian Natalie Cerrillo had a fitting way to describe the event’s significance.\n“We all have one thing in common ... today,” she said.\nThe events opened with the traditional “Pomp and Circumstance” playing over the speakers as 328 seniors walked out onto the field. In groups of four, they gradually made their way from behind the stands through center field and to the bleachers set up at the 50-yard line.\nKathryn Acheson, Othello High School’s principal, opened the ceremony with congratulations to the seniors and parents for reaching this point. She first welcomed Cerrillo for her speech and took a photo with her family. After she spoke, Acheson welcomed co-valedictorian Claire Gilbert for her speech and family photo.\nThey both spoke in similar tones of achievement and pride in what this day meant, the culmination of early mornings, late nights studying, athletics and other extracurriculars.\n“I’ve stayed up late so many nights, and I’ve spent a lot of time asking my parents and my friends for advice and help with my assignments when I don’t know how to do them and stuff like that,” Gilbert said.\nElizabeth De Jesus Flores from Desert Oasis High School also spoke and praised her peers, teachers and family for helping her throughout high school. She dedicated her success in high school and graduation to her parents, who were huge motivators for her throughout high school.\nStudent Body President Riley Rodriguez was up next to speak, but not before being welcomed with cheers and chants from his peers. Rodriguez was emotional throughout his speech, often holding back tears when thanking family and friends for their support during his high school career.\nHe thanked his teachers for making Othello High School a second home for him and pushing him to be the best version of himself.\n“This is such a surreal moment for me, and a huge milestone,” he said. “I’m a first-gen with my family. They’ve done so many things for me; they pushed me so hard, they made me, they took me everywhere, took me to study, took me to everything, gave me everything, gave me everything I could have in life.”\nRodriguez said he did not remember most of his speech because of how emotional he was. After his speech, he was welcomed back to the stage twice more to accept two awards for student activity and service.\nFrom there, the presentation of diplomas began. Students formed two lines and administrators began announcing their names. Most students made their walk brief with a handshake and a quick photo. Other students had more fun with their walk; after receiving their diploma, one student stepped onto the grass and did a celebratory backflip.\nParents flooded the aisles to get good photos of their kids, and many cheers and chants rained throughout the ceremony. Once the names were read through, and students returned to their seats, Acheson led her students into the traditional turning of the tassel.\nCongratulations rang out and the Class of 2025 tossed their caps in the air. Students and parents gathered on the field after the ceremony to embrace and take photos.",

    "title": "PlayStation Fan Buys Raffle Ticket and Gets Awesome Prize",
    "text": "Summary\n- A lucky PlayStation fan won a PS5 Pro from a $10 raffle ticket, saving hundreds.\n- PlayStation enjoyed a big year in 2024 with the PS5 Pro's launch and release of games like Astro Bot.\n- The PS5 Pro lacks a built-in disc tray, but offers hardware upgrades for improved gaming.\nA lucky PlayStation fan earned an impressive prize after buying a raffle ticket for just $10, which led to them winning a PlayStation 5 Pro console, earning them a new way to play games at an extremely low price. The system normally retails for just under $700 and, while it does not feature a disc tray, will give the fan access to a wide array of PlayStation console exclusives and its huge library of third-party games.\nPlayStation had a big year in 2024, with the PS5 Pro launching in November and the brand overall celebrating its 30th anniversary, which brought a slew of limited-edition merchandise and exclusive online store sales to honor the milestone. Alongside the celebration, Sony also enjoyed several massively successful game launches, with some even taking home accolades at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year winner Astro Bot.\nRelated\nPS5 Releases New Console Update for January 2025\nSony releases a brand-new PlayStation 5 system software update that is rolling out to users right now.\nReddit user Suspicious-Dress-767 shared an image of the PS5 Pro they reportedly won as a raffle prize for only $10 on the official PlayStation subreddit, expressing their gratitude toward the big win, given how expensive such a console usually is. While any model of PS5 would already be an expensive prize, the PS5 Pro comes with significant hardware upgrades intended to help with performance and graphical fidelity, making the win that much more valuable.\nPlayStation Fan's Lucky Raffle Win Leaves Other Fans Envious\nFans in the comments of the original post were seemingly envious of the user, expressing how lucky they felt the fan was for winning such an expensive gift for a price as low as $10, especially since they are likely not the only entrant. Some simply turned up to congratulate the user and even suggest some games to play on it, with one fan pointing out the unique upgrades made to God of War Ragnarok for the PS5 Pro.\nOf course, without a built-in disc drive, the library of games on the PS5 Pro by default is limited to the digital library available on the PlayStation Store, but there is an optional add-on that will add the feature at an extra cost. Either way, the PlayStation Store frequently undergoes digital store sales, bringing significant discounts to some of the biggest games on the platform, with current deals on first-party games like Gran Turismo 7 or The Last of Us Part 1.\nThis is far from the only time a PlayStation fan has gotten lucky and earned a brand-new console for little to no cost, as another fan received a PS5 console as a Christmas gift from their workplace. In any case, with the PlayStation brand continuing to evolve as time goes on and more major releases set to come in the near future, there is likely to be plenty to play for anyone who recently got their hands on the console.",

    "text": "Pastora joga fora anjos de Maíra Cardi: 'Crente não pode'\nIsadora Pompeo chegou a associar imagem de asas de anjo com 'anjo caído'; veja\nA ex-BBB Maira Cardi, de 41 anos, chamou a atenção de seus seguidores na manhã deste domingo, 16, ao relatar que Isadora Pompeo, cantora gospel e pastora, jogou fora todas as imagens de anjos e referências divinas que decoravam sua casa.\nReceba as principais notícias direto no WhatsApp!\n[Inscreva-se no canal do Terra]\nPara evitar mal-entendidos, Maira Cardi deixou claro que permitiu que Isadora Pompeo removesse as obras de arte. Segundo ela, a pastora afirmou que \"crente não pode\" ter esse tipo de imagem em casa.\n\"Isadora Pompeo foi lá em casa e jogou tudo fora: tudo de anjo, de estátua, disse que 'crente não pode'. Jogou fora minhas obras de arte\", afirmou Maira, que passou por um episódio traumático recentemente. Ela perdeu o bebê que esperava de Thiago Nigro.\nA ex-BBB ainda tentou argumentar com a pastora, sugerindo que poderia doar as imagens para alguém, mas Isadora não permitiu, alertando que ninguém deveria tê-las.\n\"Ela [Isadora Pompeo] vai lá em casa e arranca tudo\", disse Maíra, citando que a pastora explicou que as estátuas de anjos poderiam representar um \"anjo caído\".\n\"Eu tinha uma dessas gigantes, que comprei em Miami, e aí a Isadora Pompeo falou: 'Tira daí'. Ela sentiu algo, não sei o que foi. Mas falou: 'Isso é um anjo caído'\", contou.\nAo finalizar o assunto, seguindo a linha de raciocínio de Isadora Pompeo, Maira Cardi afirmou que agora se considera uma pessoa 'desapegada de tudo'.\n'Crente pode ou não pode?': repercussão nas redes\nPor mais que Maíra Cardi tenha dado permissão para que Isadora removesse as obras de arte da casa da amiga, a postura da ex-BBB e da cantora gospel dividiu opiniões.\nNo Instagram, muitas pessoas não concordaram com o fato de se jogar as imagens fora.\n\"Por isso sigo Deus dentro de mim para não precisar viver dentro de uma igreja\", disse uma seguidora. \"É porque a Maíra é meio 'lelé', porque dúvido se fosse na minha casa ela iria jogar algo fora\", disse outra criticando. \"Cada um com seus ídolos, até parece que alguém vai na minha casa tirar alguma coisa\", disse mais um. \"Que bobeira por isso não sigo religião, religião é comércio, é alienação\", comentou mais um.",
