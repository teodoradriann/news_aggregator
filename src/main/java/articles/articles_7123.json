    "text": "AKASHI, Japan -- As Japan heads to the polls in a national election this Sunday, the unpopularity of the incumbent government led by newly installed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has left rare [clouds of uncertainty](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japan-s-uncertain-lower-house-election-outlook-What-s-at-stake) looming over the vote's outcome in a country where one party has been the dominant ruling force for 65 of the last 69 years.\nOne certainty persists, however. Whatever the outline of the administration that takes shape after the ballot, Japan's next government faces an almighty headache on defense policy: It must deal with an ambitious but stalled plan, worth [nearly $400 billion](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Defense/Japan-defense-spending-plan-takes-30-hit-from-weak-yen) when it was launched, to ramp up defense spending significantly at a time of security tensions against a backdrop of war in Ukraine, China's increasingly aggressive military posture in Asia and growing doubts over North Korea's next steps.",

    "text": "February 20, 2025 Contact Information John Senn ( Senn.John@epa.gov ) (857) 329-2447 R1 Press Office ( R1_Press@epa.gov ) BOSTON (February 20, 2025) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced a settlement with Dwight RE, LLC that includes $41,322 in a civil penalty and actions that will help protect residents of their properties in New Haven, Conn., from lead paint exposure risks in the future.\nUnder the settlement, the company will come into and maintain compliance with federal lead paint disclosure regulations. Dwight RE will also revise its online leasing practices so that its tenants sign and date lead disclosure forms, as required by law. Before EPA's enforcement action, tenants were signing leases, but not the disclosure forms.\nIn August 2023, an EPA representative inspected Dwight RE to determine its compliance with federal lead paint disclosure regulations. Dwight RE manages 13 properties in New Haven, all of which were built before 1978. Residential buildings built before 1978 are defined as \"target housing\" under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as they may contain lead paint.\nEPA found that Dwight RE failed to provide tenants in eight apartments with an EPA-approved lead hazard information pamphlet prior to the tenants becoming obligated to lease the apartment, failed to provide in or attached to the lease contract a statement disclosing the presence of known lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards and a list of any records or reports pertaining to lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards, as required by law. EPA determined during its investigation that no children lived in the apartments where the alleged violations occurred.\nThe single largest cause of childhood lead poisoning is from exposure to lead from deteriorated or disturbed lead paint. Nearly 30% of homes in the United States, mostly those built before 1978, have lead-based paint. Millions of people continue to be exposed to lead in their homes, childcare facilities, and in other buildings where lead-based paint is in deteriorating conditions (peeling, chipping, cracking, or damaged).\nBackground: Under the federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act and TSCA, EPA inspects worksites and records of renovation firms, abatement firms, property managers, landlords, and real estate agents for compliance with lead-related environmental laws and regulations.\nRead more about EPA's work to enforce lead laws and regulations.\nRead more about real estate disclosures about potential lead hazards.",

    "text": "Life Goals – Adventures - Possibilities All Reasons to Drive Sober this New Year’s (COLORADO) – Party too hard this holiday weekend and you might meet a Colorado State trooper. With increased alcohol consumption and other impairing substances during New Year’s celebrations, it’s no wonder that impairment-caused crashes and fatalities commonly spike up at calendar year-end. Last year, the Colorado State Patrol responded to 20 crashes determined to be caused by an impaired driver on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. “The New Year is a time where people often reflect on their life, set life goals and dream of new adventures,” stated Col. Matthew C. Packard, chief of the Colorado State Patrol. “All the possibilities quickly become doubtful with a DUI. Instead, the only thing you can count on for 2024 is becoming a New Year’s drunk driving statistic.” Just like last year, troopers will step up their efforts and increase patrols seeking impaired drivers before they cause a needless tragedy. Looking at the year-to-date crash picture, Colorado State Patrol crash investigators have handled over 210 crashes from January through July. “Make your first decision of the New Year a healthy one; don’t drive drunk or high,” stated Col. Matthew C. Packard, chief of the Colorado State Patrol. “There is nothing I dread more than informing a family that their loved one won’t be coming home. Make a plan for a sober ride.” If drugs or alcohol are a part of your New Year’s plan, line up a rideshare, taxi, public transportation, sober friend/family member, or plan on staying the night at that location. Troopers continue to take a low-tolerance approach to the top fatal crash factors, including lane violations, impaired driving and speeding while launching a yearlong campaign called “Drive Safe.” This campaign reminds people to reflect on everything they love and value and plan a sober ride when planning to celebrate.",

    "text": "Estonia welcomes Sweden's accession to NATO\nRepublic of Estonia - Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n08.03.2024\nSweden has become the 32nd member of NATO after depositing its NATO ratification instrument to the U.S. Department of State today. Estonia welcomes Sweden's accession to NATO.\nAccording to Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, this is a historic event. \"As of today, the entire Nordic and Baltic region belongs to NATO,\" said Kallas. \"This is a historic turning point that will strengthen the security of our entire region as well as the Alliance.\"\nThe Prime Minister recalled that at in late 2021, Russia demanded the closure of NATO's doors with ultimatums. \"Today, NATO is more united than ever and stronger with two powerful allies - Sweden and Finland,\" the Prime Minister said.\nThe Prime Minister added that the NATO accession of Sweden and Finland will provide us with new opportunities for closer bilateral defence cooperation with both countries.\n\"Sweden's NATO membership will significantly enhance the security of both the Baltic Sea and the Alliance as a whole,\" said Minister of Defence Hanno Pevkur. \"It's worth noting that both the armed forces and the defence industry will significantly strengthen NATO's defence shield, and the s strategic location of Sweden will allow NATO greater freedom of action on the Baltic Sea. In short, Estonia and the Baltic region can feel considerably more secure.\"\n\"We and the Swedish people share the understanding that Russia is a direct threat to peace and security in the region,\" added Pevkur. \"We are naturally interested in intensifying practical cooperation with Sweden, both bilaterally and within NATO, in order to further develop the collective defence of the Alliance in the best possible way.\"\nAccording to Minister of Foreign Affairs Margus Tsahkna, Sweden's accession will allow us to respond even more effectively to any challenges and threats in our region. \"The fact that Estonia and Sweden are no longer just neighbours and partners, but NATO allies, will enable closer cooperation in the field of defence and security, significantly enhance the security of the Baltic Sea region and improve the security of supply of NATO's Eastern flank,\" said Tsahkna.\nAccording to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sweden's accession sends an important message about NATO's open door policy. \"Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, signed 75 years ago, states that each European country must be able to decide on its own security arrangements,\" said Tsahkna. \"Sweden's membership proves that the door of the alliance is open to democratic European countries and that all processes related to accession are decided only by the allies. Neither Russia nor anyone else has a power of veto over this issue.\"\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",
