    "title": "'Too little, too late': Justice Jackson blasts conservatives in emergency abortion ruling",
    "text": "U.S.\nSupreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dressed down her conservative colleagues Thursday despite a decision that will allow for emergency abortions in Idaho for now.\nIn a ruling\nleaked the day before, the high court dismissed an appeal by Idaho officials and allowed a stay ordered by a lower court to remain in place. The Supreme Court's decision effectively left the question about emergency abortions in Idaho undecided.\nJackson said there was \"no good reason\" that the court could not immediately decide the case.\nAlthough Jackson voted with the majority, she blasted the court for the way the case was handled.\nALSO READ:\nMarjorie Taylor Greene buys condo in 'crime ridden hell hole'\n\"We cannot simply wind back the clock to how things were before the Court injected itself into this matter,\" Jackson wrote in her partial dissent. \"We permitted Idaho's law to go into effect by staying the District Court's injunction in the first place, then allowed this matter to sit on our merits docket for five months while we considered the question presented.\"\n\"It is too little, too late for the Court to take a mulligan and just tell the lower courts to carry on as if none of this has happened,\" she added. \"As the old adage goes: The Court has made this bed so now it must lie in it—by proceeding to decide the merits of the critical pre-emption issue this case presents.\"\nThe decision comes two years after the court struck down Roe v. Wade and federal abortion rights.\nRead the entire ruling\nhere.",

    "text": "Related videos:\nA 15-year-old teenager and an adult, who had disappeared after going fishing on a raft in Havana, have been found alive and are receiving medical care in a hospital in Matanzas, according to a person close to the family.\n\"They have been found; a ship discovered them and they are being treated in a hospital in Matanzas,\" reported the source who alerted the editorial team of CiberCuba about the disappearance.\nThe teenager, identified as Yusuan Fundora Massaguet, had set off last Friday, January 17th, on a rustic boat from Playa del Chivo, in the Habana del Este area, to go fishing. His disappearance sparked an intense search by his family and friends, who used social media to request help and information about his whereabouts.\nDuring the days they were missing, the family expressed their anguish due to the adverse weather conditions reported at the time of their departure, which heightened their concern for their safety.\nSo far, no additional details have been provided regarding the conditions in which they were found or the health status of both individuals rescued. However, the discovery of their survival has brought relief to the community that was closely following the situation.\nIn Cuba, reports of fishermen missing at sea have increased over the past year. The lack of official channels for searching for people has forced families to turn to digital platforms to obtain information and mobilize rescue efforts.\nMore details about their health status and the circumstances of their discovery are expected to be provided in the coming hours.\nFiled under:",

Log in here » WINNIPEG – Manitoba Progressive Conservatives are kicking off their leadership race and have decided not to use online voting. The party has announced that nomination forms will be available starting Friday for a leadership that will be decided on April 26 of next year — a date that was revealed two months ago. The Tories are looking to replace former premier Heather Stefanson, who announced her plan to step down after the Tories lost October’s provincial election. Interim leader Wayne Ewasko had left the door open to a leadership run, but now says he has decided not to enter the race due to family reasons. The Tories recently changed their constitution to allow for online voting in addition to their traditional mail-in ballots. But Brad Zander, head of the party’s leadership committee, says online voting won’t be adopted for this race, partly because of cost concerns. “After the election, the party has some ground to make up financially, and with each different option you provide in terms of voting, it increases costs,” Zander said Thursday. Concern about introducing a new voting system at a time when party staff and volunteers are already facing other changes was also a factor, Zander said. The Tories overhauled their rules in January in an attempt to avoid the kind of controversy that erupted when Stefanson narrowly won the leadership in the fall of 2021. There was a last-minute surge in party memberships and many members complained they did not receive mail-in ballots in time to vote. An internal review of that race’s problems pointed to other issues, including the possibility that the party’s one-member, one-vote system left it open to a takeover from single-interest outsiders. The new leadership rules require more time between the cutoff of membership sales and the deadline for people to mail in ballots. The rules also tweak the formula for counting votes. They continue to allow every Tory member to cast a ballot, but they incorporate a point system to limit the weight of constituencies with big membership numbers. The aim is to ensure that the leadership race cannot be decided by a flood of new members in one or two constituencies. The Tories latest electoral setback was a byelection defeat last week in Stefanson’s Tuxedo seat to the governing New Democrats. The Tories had held that seat ever since its creation in 1979. Ewasko said the Tories were hampered by an early election call but saw some positive news that multiple candidates sought to be the Tory candidate “It was a snap election call by the premier. That being said … the Progressive Conservatives were the only party to hold a (contested nomination) contest,” Ewasko said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 27, 2024.",

    "text": "La OEA repudia el intento de golpe en Bolivia La resolución asegura que la Organización de Estados Americanos (OEA) resolvió \"condenar enérgicamente el despliegue ilegal de unidades del Ejército del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia\" y expresa su solidaridad con el pueblo boliviano. La OEA aprobó este jueves por unanimidad, durante la asamblea general del organismo en Asunción, una resolución en repudio al intento de golpe de Estado registrado la víspera en Bolivia, al tiempo que puso el foco en las crisis de Nicaragua, Haití y la inseguridad en la región. La resolución asegura que la Organización de Estados Americanos (OEA) resolvió \"condenar enérgicamente el despliegue ilegal de unidades del Ejército del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia\" y expresa su solidaridad con el pueblo boliviano. Agrega que la movilización de tropas rebeldes en La Paz fue \"una amenaza al régimen constitucional\" y denuncia \"cualquier intento de desestabilizar las instituciones democráticas\". \"Estamos muy orgullosos de ser copatrocinantes de esa resolución y afirmamos que nuestro compromiso es con la democracia\", dijo a periodistas en Asunción Richard Verma, adjunto del jefe de la diplomacia estadounidense, Antony Blinken. Militares intentaron el miércoles derribar una puerta del palacio presidencial de La Paz, en una maniobra que el presidente boliviano, Luis Arce, calificó de \"golpe de Estado\". Su gobierno anunció este jueves la detención de 17 personas sospechosas de participar, entre militares activos y en retiro y varios civiles. El hecho causó el repudio generalizado de todos los representantes de los Estados miembros mientras los hechos acontecían, incluidos el presidente anfitrión, el paraguayo Santiago Peña, y el secretario general de la OEA, Luis Almagro. El embajador de Bolivia ante la OEA, Héctor Enrique Arce Zaconeta, agradeció por la respuesta de los miembros de la organización multilateral al tiempo que sucedían los hechos en Bolivia. \"La rápida reacción de los países generó uno de los elementos que favoreció y fue determinante para el fracaso de un intento desestabilizador\", dijo Arce Zaconeta en el marco de la 54º asamblea general que comenzó oficialmente el miércoles y termina el viernes en la sede de la Conmebol en Asunción. Tanquetas y tropas lideradas por el general Juan José Zúñiga, quien posteriormente fue destituido como comandante del ejército y detenido por la policía, ocuparon la Plaza Murillo del centro político de Bolivia el miércoles. Los militares intentaron derribar con uno de los vehículos una puerta del palacio presidencial, en una maniobra que el mandatario boliviano, Luis Arce, calificó de \"golpe de Estado\". El hecho causó el repudio generalizado de todos los representantes de los Estados miembros mientras los hechos acontecían, incluidos el presidente anfitrión, el paraguayo Santiago Peña, y el secretario general de la OEA, Luis Almagro. - Nicaragua, Haití y la inseguridad - El organismo hemisférico aprobó, además, una resolución para el \"seguimiento a la situación en Nicaragua\", que dejó de ser Estado miembro en noviembre del año pasado a pedido de su presidente, Daniel Ortega. Las relaciones del país centroamericano con la comunidad internacional se han tensado desde la represión de las protestas de 2018 contra el mandatario nicaragüense, en el poder desde 2007 y reelegido sucesivamente. El estadounidense Verma afirmó que su país \"seguirá denunciando\" el \"régimen\" de Ortega y de su esposa, la vicepresidenta Rosario Murillo, y \"abogando por que se respeten los derechos del pueblo nicaragüense en cumplimiento de sus obligaciones interamericanas\". También se aceptó una resolución orientada a mitigar la crisis humanitaria y política que sufre Haití, que recientemente recibió una misión de asistencia policial de Kenia para combatir a pandillas que tienen sumido al país caribeño en una grave crisis. El documento propone continuar los esfuerzos para restablecer la seguridad, la asistencia humanitaria, el desarrollo socioeconómico \"y la prestación de asistencia para la protección de los derechos humanos y la democracia en Haití\". La delegada haitiana, la canciller Dominique Dupuy, aseguró que su gobierno, recién elegido a finales de mayo en medio de una inestabilidad política de larga data, está decidido a \"tomar todas las medidas necesarias para volver a los acuerdos de transición política\". Además, sostuvo, velará por la \"vuelta al Estado de derecho, la justicia social y elecciones para renovar el personal político\". Finalmente, la asamblea puso la lupa en el combate al crimen y la inseguridad. Entre otros, la ministra de Exteriores de Ecuador, Gabriela Sommerfeld, denunció la \"devastadora presencia en la región (del crimen organizado) y su alarmante carácter transnacional\". Ubicado entre Colombia y Perú -los mayores productores mundiales de cocaína-, Ecuador dejó hace años de ser una isla de paz y se convirtió en un centro logístico para el envío de droga, principalmente cocaína, hacia Europa y Estados Unidos. \"¿Qué democracia sobrevivirá si los poderes del Estado se van infectando de este cáncer organizado transnacional?\", se preguntó Sommerfeld.",

    "text": "CINCINNATI ( WXIX /Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida.\nThe Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky.\nUp until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another.\nSome might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle.\nDean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida.\nSeveral streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials.\n“You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled.\nWith several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land.\n“The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained.\nWatching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids.\nThe Bell family responded.\n“We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said.\nThat plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911.\n“I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said.\nMeanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action.\n“I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’”\nThat’s where little Hank Bell came in.\n“I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.”\nFlotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water.\n“He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.”\nGinger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey.\n“When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered.\n“I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.”\nThe rescue took about five minutes.\nBack on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.”\nThe families say they have plans to reunite in the near future.\nThe Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners.\nThose tactics could save a life.\nCopyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Unorganised workers’ union seeks TN resolution against Centre’s labour codes\nThe federation is garnering the support of INDIA bloc MPs to raise the issue in Parliament, highlighting 'anti-labour' aspects of the policy\nCHENNAI: After completing a State-wide campaign from November 6 to 26 demanding the repeal of the Union government's controversial labour codes, members of the Unorganised Workers Federation (UWF) and representatives of various sectoral welfare boards are pinning their hopes on a resolution in the Tamil Nadu Assembly to strengthen the movement further.\nMembers of the federations have appealed to the State government to make a policy decision against the Centre’s four labour codes and pass a resolution in the forthcoming Assembly session, like the one adopted over NEET. The labour activists argue that such a resolution would protect the 38 functioning welfare boards and their registered members and safeguard State laws related to worker welfare.\nThe labour codes brought by the BJP-led Centre are \"pro-corporate\", and demand puts the rights and livelihoods of unorganised workers at risk, they argue.\nA delegation from the UWF, headed by its president TM Chandran, met with Chief Secretary N Muruganandam at the Secretariat on Thursday to submit their representations regarding the issue. \"We received a positive response from the CS and the Labour Secretary (Veera Raghava Rao) during the meeting. The CS made it clear that action will be taken to protect the welfare boards,\" said R Geetha of the UWF.\nThe federation appreciated the boards being run in Tamil Nadu as role models for the rest of the country and urged for their protection. They have been steadfast in their protest against the labour codes even since they were announced in 2019 and 2020.\nThe federation toured 37 districts to explain to the working class in detail the adverse impact of the Centre’s labour codes and how they would dilute key State laws, including the Tamil Nadu Manual Workers (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Work) Act, 1982, the Tamil Nadu Fishermen and Labourers Engaged in Fishing and Other Allied Activities (Social Security and Welfare) Act, 2007, and The Tamil Nadu Agricultural Labourers-Farmers (Social Security and Welfare) Act, 2006. The workers' social security would cease to exist once the codes come into effect, while the State's authority to register workers and implement welfare schemes would be undermined, they allege.\nThe federation is also contemplating meeting prominent MPs, including Kanimozhi and A Raja of the DMK and Vishnu Prasad of the Congress, to request they raise the issue in Parliament. The federation's counterparts in other states are trying to reach out to some other MPs of the INDIA bloc.",
