    "title": "Israel agrees “in principle” on Gaza-Cyprus humanitarian corridor - timenews",
    "text": "2023-12-29 01:00:00 Nearly two million Gazans have been driven from their homes by the war between Israel and Hamas, 85% of all of Gaza, according to the UN. And 40% of its population is now at risk of famine, the agency insists. The dead in the strip are also more than 21,300, according to the Ministry of Health of the Palestinian enclave. But only now, with these figures that hide so many names, a new ball of oxygen begins to emerge: Israel gives its approval “in principle” to Cyprus to open a maritime corridor between the EU member island and the strip. The Israeli Foreign Ministry confirmed it yesterday: “In principle there is authorization to use this route [marítima], but there are still some practical problems to be solved.” There is agreement on Israeli supervision. And it is known key. Also read Alexis Rodríguez-Rata The Israeli Government raises its tone against Lebanon and warns it that it will take measures if it does not act against Hizbullah It is hoped that Cyprus can contribute to increasing humanitarian aid to the 2.4 million Gazans. It is barely 400 kilometers from the coast of Gaza. But whether it means anything more remains to be seen, since on the ground the war no longer has “safe zones” and the fighting extends to Rafah, in the south of the strip, on the border with Egypt and where a good part of internally displaced persons, say the United Nations. And not only. In the north of the Palestinian enclave, both Gaza City and Jabaliya are the scene of intense fighting and a UN refugee agency clinic has been destroyed in the Beit Hanun area. There is also fighting in the refugee camps in central Gaza and yesterday at least five people died in a children’s school that was now used as a shelter for displaced people.

Doubts about their ability to complete the main military objective in Gaza grow as pressure from the relatives of the hostages held by Hamas, 129 according to the Government of Israel, to achieve their release continues. Their posters are the only ones that remain on the fences leading to the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. Furthermore, on the border between Israel and Lebanon, everything is complicated. Hezbollah rocket alerts are repeated every day on Israelis’ cell phones, and this Wednesday Benny Gantz, minister without portfolio in Beniamin Netanyahu’s government and a strong man within the war cabinet, warned Beirut: “The situation on our border North demands a change. Time for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the Lebanese government does not act to prevent bombing in the north and move Hezbollah away from the border, our forces will do so.” Launching an offensive in Lebanon sooner rather than later to fight the Iranian-backed militia is on the table. The exchange of rockets has not stopped for weeks and in recent days its intensity has grown and reached areas until now out of reach, such as the south of the Golan Heights. Also read Alexis Rodríguez-Rata Israel is increasingly leaning towards the possibility of undertaking two interventions on the ground in parallel: in Gaza and Lebanon. Any hint of a temporary truce is fading in the region. Cairo reports, in fact, that it has not received any response to its plan to resolve the conflict in Gaza. Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad insist on not negotiating any new ceasefire agreement as long as Israel’s attacks against the strip continue and put “all in exchange for all” as a condition for releasing the Israeli hostages captured on October 7. For Israel, the essential thing is to free the hostages and put an end to Hamas. The impasse is still there and is joined by the West Bank, which is experiencing levels of violence that it has not seen for two decades. Yesterday morning a simultaneous Israeli raid on Jenin, Ramallah, Hebron and other West Bank cities left a young Palestinian dead. Israel claims to have acted against Hamas financing and confiscated “tens of millions of shekels” in various locations, including currency exchange offices. But on Wednesday six more young people died in Tulkarem, and in the area this year there are already 520 Palestinian deaths, more than one hundred minors. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has called on Israel to “end the illegal killings” of Palestinians and “settler violence” in the West Bank. The Israel Museum in Jerusalem houses like no other in the country the long and turbulent history of the Middle East region since before Israel was Israel and Palestine was Palestine. Today, in the middle of the war, it closes rooms due to the “security situation,” explains a red sign at its entrance. In it, as in the various fronts on which Israel fights, nothing says that normality will return soon.

    "title": "80% TCS Employees Will Get Salary Hike: These Employees Will Get Higher Salary From Sep 1 - Trak.in - Indian Business of Tech, Mobile & Startups",
    "text": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services company, has announced a salary hike for about 80% of its employees, mainly in junior and mid-level roles. The hike will take effect from September 1, 2025, as confirmed by TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad and CHRO Designate K Sudeep in an internal communication reviewed by PTI.\nThe compensation revision is expected to impact grades up to C3A and equivalent, covering a significant portion of the company’s global workforce.\nNo Clarity Yet on Hike Percentage\nTCS has not disclosed the exact percentage of the salary increment. However, the move is seen as a morale-boosting gesture amid ongoing layoffs and uncertainties in the tech industry.\nIn a statement, TCS said:\n“We are pleased to announce a compensation revision for all eligible associates in grades up to C3A and equivalent, covering 80% of our workforce.”\nThe email also acknowledged employee dedication and thanked them for their continued hard work as TCS navigates through transformation and market challenges.\nLayoffs Amid Hikes: A Dual Strategy\nInterestingly, the salary hikes come even as TCS moves forward with plans to lay off 12,000 employees this year, citing the need to build a “future-ready organisation.”\nMost of these layoffs will affect mid-level and senior staff, with the company attributing the decision to its shift toward artificial intelligence (AI), market expansion, and workforce restructuring. According to TCS, approximately 2% of its global workforce will be affected, and redeployment opportunities are being explored.\nA Sign of Larger IT Sector Trends\nThe decision reflects broader trends in India’s IT sector—cost optimisation, automation, and AI integration—especially during a period of global economic instability and changing client demands. It also comes amid political tensions and tariff threats from the US, which are affecting outsourcing sentiment and tech investment.\nTCS’s compensation revision, paired with strategic workforce realignment, signals a new era for India’s IT bellwether.",

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judih Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. In a YouTube video made during a brief round of fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group last May, Ms Weinstein read a series of poems and expressed hope for better days ahead. “I truly hope that the next time I’m recording some Haiku it won’t be under duress, under rocket fire, under conditions where people are at war,” she said. “May we all be granted the right to our basic rights of home, food, shelter and peaceful days. Here’s hoping.” Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.

El funcionario se enfrenta a una posible condena a 13 años de prisión.\nSe trata de Luciano David Díaz, de 38 años, que fue acusado del intento de femicidio de quien fuera su pareja. El juicio comenzó el lunes por la tarde y es presidido por los jueces Pablo Spekuljak, Pablo Ruiz Staiger y Sergio Carraro.\nLa fiscal Jorgelina Moser Ferro, que espera lograr una condena de 13 años de prisión para Díaz, argumentó que la actitud del penitenciario demostró un total desprecio por la vida de la víctima. Por su parte, la defensa intentó minimizar los hechos, aunque las pruebas presentadas hasta ahora por la acusadora refuerzan la teoría del caso fiscal.\nSe espera que los alegatos finales sean el lunes 11 de abril, y la sentencia sea emitida poco después.\nLa madrugada del 11 de diciembre de 2022 fue el escenario de un ataque brutal. Según la acusación presentada por la fiscalía, Díaz atacó a su pareja en la vivienda que compartían, ubicada entre las calles Piedrabuena y Cafferata.\nPrimero la agredió violentamente, propinándole fuertes golpes en la cara y el pecho, lo que le causó lesiones visibles. Posteriormente, el agresor roció el cuerpo de la mujer con combustible, amenazándola con prenderla fuego mientras manipulaba un encendedor, aunque este no llegó a encenderse.\nSegún la acusación, la víctima, aterrada por la amenaza de muerte inminente, logró huir de la casa en el momento en que Díaz intentó iniciar el fuego. La mujer se refugió rápidamente en la casa de su hermana, buscando seguridad y protección. Sin embargo, el ataque no terminó allí.\nCon el objetivo de continuar con su agresión, Díaz se subió a su moto y embistió la puerta de la vivienda en un intento de forzar su entrada. A pesar de sus esfuerzos, la policía fue alertada a tiempo y logró interceptar al agresor antes de que pudiera consumar su intención de continuar con el ataque.\nFue detenido en el acto y llevado a la comisaría, donde se le imputaron cargos por el intento de femicidio.\nEl juicio en curso también revela una historia más profunda de violencia de género prolongada, que abarca más de 15 años de convivencia entre el acusado y la víctima. A lo largo de esta relación, la mujer había sufrido múltiples episodios de agresión física, y el comportamiento de Díaz se caracterizó por un patrón de control y abuso sistemático.\nLa fiscalía destacó que, en los últimos 5 años previos al ataque que originó este juicio, las agresiones fueron recurrentes y que Díaz mantenía un control absoluto sobre la víctima, no solo mediante el uso de la violencia física, sino también a través de amenazas constantes.\nSegún se mencionó en las audiencias preliminares, Díaz había amenazado reiteradamente con matarla si intentaba dejarlo, lo que evidenció un contexto de miedo y sumisión de la mujer hacia su agresor.\nAdemás, el acusado utilizaba su posición como agente penitenciario para intimidar aún más a la víctima, manipulando las dinámicas de poder en la relación para someterla.\nLa fiscalía resalta que este comportamiento muestra una clara manifestación de los efectos devastadores del machismo estructural y la impunidad de ciertos sectores dentro de la sociedad, lo cual empeora la situación para las víctimas de violencia de género.",
