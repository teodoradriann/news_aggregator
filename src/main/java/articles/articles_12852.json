    "text": "Anthony Larson describes himself as a hard-core ice fisher.\nLiving in La Crosse, Wisconsin, right next to the\nMississippi River, he has the luxury to fulfill that description. Once the river and its backwaters ice over each winter, he aims to fish every day, using his work commute to scope out particular spots he wants to hit. Even if all he can spare at the end of the day is 15 or 20 minutes, he goes for it.\nThis winter was different.\nThe\nabove-average temperatures across the upper Midwest, driven in part by the El Niño climate pattern and in part by human-caused climate change, made for less than one month of safe ice on the river, scientists estimate. Though Larson was still able to get out on the ice, the conditions prevented him and his fellow anglers from getting to their favorite spots.\n“We were all kind of trapped within a couple hundred yards of a shoreline,” he said, which affects the type of fish that can be caught and reduces the number.\nThe upper Mississippi River as it snakes along Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa\ntypically freezes during the coldest months of the year, particularly the more languid backwater channels and even the river’s main channel — used by shipping traffic in warmer weather — if it stays cold long enough. Things usually thaw out at the end of March.\nThis season, the last of that ice melted and was floating downstream at the end of February, said Kathi Jo Jankowski, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey based in La Crosse. Many described the winter conditions as something they’d never experienced before. But as climate change continues to progress, it could become familiar.\n“We’re peering into the future of our ice conditions,” Jankowski said. “This year is going to give us a lot of interesting information about what iceless winters are going to look like.”\nWarm, volatile winter caused unusual ice conditions\nWhen snow fell across Wisconsin on Halloween, Jankowski said it made people hopeful that a great winter lay ahead. But\nthe warm-up that occurred around Christmas Day thawed any ice that had accumulated. In early January, when U.S. Geological Survey staff monitored water quality on the river, they got into the water on regular boats instead of boats that can drive over ice, which they typically have to use that time of year, Jankowski said.\nTemperatures plunged in mid-January, causing the river to freeze up like normal. But it didn’t last long. The winter ended up being\nWisconsin’s warmest on record.\nThe January deep-freeze followed by a quick warm-up caused that ice to float quickly downstream, Jankowski said. Conservation staff in Iowa, Illinois and Missouri saw ice floes and so-called “pancake ice” (round pieces of ice that form as a result of wave action), which are rare on that stretch of river.\nAlthough the lack of snow put those unusual formations on display, that type of ice is weak, Jankowski said.\n“It’s not the kind of ice that people are looking for if they’re going to try to walk out there or get out there fishing,” she said. “It’s beautiful, but a little more dangerous.”\nIt also made it hard for researchers in those states further south who don’t typically see much ice to get out on the river. In Wisconsin, the opposite was true — Shawn Giblin, Mississippi River water quality specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said he was forced to cancel several sampling trips because the ice was unsafe or because there was no ice at all.\nHe described the season as “a bit of a bummer for a winter lover.”\nCommercial shipping season started earlier than normal\nBarge traffic on the river’s northern stretch\nhalts each winter because of ice. Lake Pepin, a reservoir of the Mississippi River that stretches 21 miles between Reads Landing and Red Wing, Minnesota, is used as an indicator of when commercial shipping can start up again because it’s typically the last place on the river to have ice cover.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ St. Paul District has conducted ice depth surveys on Lake Pepin for the last 30 years, the results of which they share with the shipping industry. Once ice on the lake is less than a foot thick, a towboat and barge can break through.\nThis year, for the first time,\nthe surveys were canceled because there wasn’t enough ice to measure. Patrick Moes, a spokesperson for the Corps district, said staff drove by the lake and saw it was mostly open.\nREAD MORE ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER\nOn Saturday, shipping season officially began on the upper river, about a week earlier than average. If the Corps hadn’t been conducting maintenance on the river’s locks and dams over the winter, it could have begun even earlier, Moes said.\nHe said he was able to ice fish just once on Lake Pepin this year, during the bitter cold in January.\n“My heart really goes out to all those outfitters and people that rely on winter recreation and activities to put food on the table,” he said, “because obviously, this winter has been unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed.”\nThis winter could give foresight on the future\nIt’s not yet clear what effect the lack of ice will have on the river ecosystem, Jankowski said. Without ice cover, sunlight can more easily penetrate the water column. That could bolster aquatic plant growth, but it could also spur earlier algae activity because the water is full of nutrients.\nMore open water also gives\ninvasive carp better opportunities to move within the river, she said.\nIce cover on the upper Mississippi is already waning. Records from Lake Pepin dating back to 1843 show that ice thaws\nabout two weeks sooner today than it did then. And as the world warms, it’s a trend that’s expected to continue.\nThis winter, then, can be used as an opportunity to think about how to adapt to future ones with less ice, Jankowski said, including adjusting our lifestyles.\nFor Larson, that’s already in process. Though he wasn’t able to ice fish as much as he wanted, he used the time to pick up another hobby: falconry.\n“This was a great year to hang the ice fishing stuff up, as much as it’s in my blood,” he said. “I was still able to find other adventures.”\nThis story is a product of the\nMississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting network based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, funded by the Walton Family Foundation.\nType of work:",

    "text": "[Ciencia y tecnología](/actualidad/ciencia-y-tecnologia)\nMuere a los 78 años el científico Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, padre de la vacuna contra la malaria\nEl colombiano ha fallecido este jueves en su casa de Bogotá, según han confirmado fuentes familiares\nEl científico colombiano Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, padre de la vacuna contra la malaria, ha fallecido este jueves a los 78 años en su casa de Bogotá. Así lo han confirmado a Efe fuentes de la familia.\nMás información\nUno de sus familiares ha confirmado que Patarroyo llevaba tiempo padeciendo problemas de salud. Finalmente, este pionero científico ha muerto \"esta mañana en su casa\", al parecer de un paro cardiorrespiratorio.\nNacido el 3 de noviembre de 1946 en la localidad de Ataco en el departamento del Tolima, Patarroyo fue uno de los científicos más aclamados de su época, llegando incluso a ganar el Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Investigación Científica y Técnica en 1994, por su labor en el ámbito de la salud.\nA lo largo de su vida, Manuel Elkin Patarroyo se dedicó profesionalmente a la medicina, ejerciendo como tal en la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, una institución a la que estuvo vinculado durante toda su carrera como investigador científico. Aun así, no fue hasta mucho más tarde cuando lograría un hito sanitario a nivel mundial.\n\"Hoy ha partido un gran científico colombiano: Manuel Elkin Patarroyo. Su legado está representado, más que en la primera vacuna sintética del mundo, en una generación de investigadores a quienes inculcó el valor de construir país, generando conocimiento. ¡GRACIAS!\", ha escrito en su cuenta de X la decana de Ciencias de la Universidad Nacional, Gabriela Delgado.\nEl colombiano descubrió y donó la vacuna contra la malaria\nEra el año 1987 cuando [Patarroyo descubría la primera vacuna sintética contra la malaria.](https://cadenaser.com/canarias/2022/09/28/patarroyo-la-vacuna-del-covid-aun-tiene-carencias-radio-club-tenerife/) En un primer momento, su descubrimiento apenas tenía un rango de un 40% de protección, aunque él no dudó en donarla a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) con el fin de que se distribuyese de manera gratuita como un regalo para la humanidad.\nPatarroyo le dedicó años de trabajo en la Fundación Instituto de Inmunología de Colombia (Fidic), de la cual fue director, a perfeccionar su creación y [a ampliar el rango de protección](https://cadenaser.com/emisora/2016/07/18/radio_club_tenerife/1468831711_441014.html). Durante su investigación, también buscaba desarrollar una fórmula madre para la creación de otras vacunas.\nAdemás del Príncipe de Asturias de Investigación Científica y Técnica, Patarroyo fue galardonado, también en 1994, con el Premio Robert Koch, el más prestigioso galardón científico de Alemania, y con el Premio León Bernard, de la OMS, entre otros reconocimientos a su obra.\nAhora, la Universidad Nacional ha recordado el legado de Patarroyo, que obtuvo su título de médico cirujano en esa institución en 1971, vinculándose al año siguiente \"como profesor ejerciendo hasta la fecha\". \"En su larga trayectoria docente e investigativa obtuvo múltiples reconocimientos y distinciones\", ha agregado el centro en un comunicado.",

    "title": "Chandler, AZ Set to Revolutionize Housing Development Regulations",
    "text": "In a move poised to reshape the housing landscape, the City of Chandler, Arizona, stands on the cusp of a pivotal transformation. On February 22, 2024, the city council will deliberate on a series of ordinances aimed at overhauling the city's approach to housing development. Among the proposed changes are the elimination of minimum lot sizes, setback requirements, minimum square footage, and the contentious 'neighborhood character' requirements. These measures are designed to streamline the housing construction process, ensuring that Chandler can accommodate its rapidly growing population with an adequate, diverse housing supply.\nA Bold Leap Towards Inclusive Growth\nAt the heart of the proposal is Ordinance No. 5075, which seeks to amend various sections of the Chandler City Code. The amendments touch upon critical aspects of city development including property maintenance, land use and zoning, sign code, and garbage and refuse collection. In tandem, Ordinance No. 5078 proposes a significant rezoning shift, allowing a parcel previously earmarked for multiple-family residential use to be developed as a single-family residence with an accessory building. This move signals Chandler's commitment to flexible, inclusive urban planning.\nReimagining Urban Spaces\nFurther bolstering the city's visionary approach is Ordinance No. 5079, which aims to increase the mid-rise overlay height allowance to 75 feet for a medical facility. This not only caters to the city's healthcare infrastructure but also exemplifies Chandler's adaptability in urban design. Complementing this, Ordinance No. 5080 seeks to rezone a parcel from single-family district to planned area development for medium-density residential use, underscoring a strategic pivot towards densification and efficient land use.\nA Future-Ready Chandler\nThe proposed ordinances reflect a holistic strategy to maintain and enhance Chandler's housing supply. By eliminating traditional constraints such as minimum lot sizes and 'neighborhood character' requirements, the city is setting a precedent for progressive, sustainable urban development. These amendments are poised to make housing construction not just easier and faster but also more attuned to the needs of a diverse, growing population.\nThe initiative by the City of Chandler to overhaul its housing development regulations marks a significant milestone in its journey towards sustainable growth. The proposed changes, encapsulated in Ordinances No. 5075, 5078, 5079, and 5080, are a testament to Chandler's proactive stance on urban planning and housing supply. By embracing flexibility, inclusivity, and efficiency, Chandler is not just addressing the immediate needs of its residents but also laying the groundwork for a future-ready city. As the city council convenes on February 22, 2024, the decisions made will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on Chandler's urban landscape, setting a bold standard for cities nationwide.",

She’ll remain as a tenured law professor at UPenn.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV, Bok emphasized that while donors are free to contribute to organizations as they see fit, they are not shareholders and should not have a ‘loud voice’ in the governance of universities.\n‘I think donors are absolutely free to give to whatever organizations they want or not to, and to withhold for any reason they choose to. But they are not shareholders, so I don’t think they should have a particularly loud voice on how universities are run.’\n‘The biggest challenge has been that we haven’t had any sort of crisis or controversy in a really long time,’ Bok said this week to Bloomberg.\nOusted UPenn board chair Scott Bok made a bold stand, insisting that deep-pocketed donors shouldn’t be calling the shots on how universities are run. He’s pictured with Liz Magill, who stood down as president earlier this month over her handling of an anti-Semitism crisis\nThis fiery statement comes in the wake of influential alumni pulling their funds in protest of the university’s handling of an anti-Semitism crisis on campus\nBok argued that trustees, typically focused on the financial health of institutions ‘shouldn’t overreact in this situation’ and become ‘involved’ in academics.\n‘It’s a small fraction of one percent of the people at these elite schools that are actively involved in a way that anybody would find troubling,’ Bok said. ‘We shouldn’t fundamentally tear up a governance model that has worked for a very, very long time and made our universities the envy of the world because of a very short-term crisis.’\nThe resignations of Bok and Magill came amid mounting pressure from donors, alumni, and lawmakers, particularly concerning allegations of anti-Semitism on campus.\nMagill was slated over her testimony to Congress about anti-Semitism, when she tried to invoke freedom of speech rules. Critics said the Ivy League college has been selective in its application of students’ and faculty’s First Amendment rights.\nAfter the congressional hearing Bok, CEO of investment bank Greenhill & Co., faced criticism from Wall Street peers, led by Apollo Management Group Inc. CEO Marc Rowan.\nRowan, also head of Penn’s business school board and a significant donor, advocated for his departure and urged other donors to withhold contributions until their resignation.\n‘I call on all UPenn alumni and supporters who believe we are heading in the wrong direction to close their checkbooks until President Elizabeth Magill and Scott Bok, chair of the board of trustees, step down,’ he wrote in a letter reported by Bloomberg in October.\nAt the time, University of Pennsylvania rejected Rowan’s demands, standing by its president and chair of the board of trustees, and brushing off any accusations of antisemitism.\nSimilar donor activism has surfaced at Harvard University, where both billionaires and recent graduates are pausing their gifts in protest against perceived inadequate measures to address antisemitism. President Claudine Gay has resisted calls to resign and has also been embroiled in a separate plagiarism scandal.\nScott L. Bok, Chair of the school’s Board of Trustees, announced his resignation following Magill’s decision to step down in early December – effective immediately\nIn a letter addressed to Magill, the Wharton Board said leadership of the university needed to change ‘with immediate effect’\nMagill resigned following calls for her to quit which only ramped up after she appeared before Congress to explain her response to the anti-Semitism\nHarvard President Claudine Gay at the congressional hearing on antisemitism on campus\nThe hearing also saw widely criticized testimony from MIT president Sally Kornbluth\nLen Blavatnik, a billionaire donor who has contributed at least $270 million to Harvard, recently suspended his gifts.\nEarlier this month, the president of the University of Pennsylvania resigned from her post following fierce backlash to her controversial congressional testimony over antisemitism on campus.\nBok stepped down from his position as the chair of the University Board of Trustees on Dec. 9 — just minutes after Penn President Magill’s resignation.\nMagill, alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, was summoned before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce by lawmakers concerned by reports of a rise in antisemitism at leading universities.\nThey faced heated questioning from committee chair Congresswoman Elise Stefanik but failed to assert that calls for genocide against Jews on campus would definitively constitute harassment.\nFollowing international outcry, including more than 70 lawmakers calling for her resignation, Magill stood down on Saturday.",

    "text": "JMCGH ceremony celebrates, honors organ donors during National Donate Life Month\nJACKSON, Tenn. — One local hospital holds a ceremony to honor organ donors and their recipients.\nDuring April, the Jackson-Madison County General Hospital honors organ donors who have given the gift of life and those whose lives have been saved.\nThey also presented the first ever James Ross Angel of Hope Award to the Critical Care Unit.\n“There are about 3,000 Tennesseans today that are waiting on a life-saving gift of an organ, and unless they receive that gift, unfortunately, they’ll pass away, and about 100,000 Americans in that same position. So, only if we have organ donors can we save those lives. So, it’s important to realize that all of us perhaps have the opportunity to save lives through organ donation,” said Byron Elam, external affairs coordinator for Tennessee Donor Services.\nSEE ALSO:\n[Record-breaking year for organ donors at JMCGH, Mayor presents proclamation]\nWith 34 donors and 79 lives saved, 2024 was a record breaking year at the hospital. During the ceremony, guests paid tribute to their loved ones by leaving messages on wooden birds that were placed on a memorial tree.\nWe heard from one family who not only received an organ, but their son donated as well.\n“You never know as you go through life at a young age or old age what life’s gonna bring. I retired from the police department in Jackson, TN. I was working the day I got the call that I needed to go home. So, my son was killed by a drunk driver; he was 7 years old. So I went to the house, and being in law enforcement I knew that he wasn’t gonna make it,” said Loran Newton, organ donor recipient.\nOrgan donation impacts the family just as much as the patient.\n“Please, please donate. I’m so thankful for our donor because without them, we wouldn’t have had my daddy. He wouldn’t have been able to walk me down the aisle,” said Melissa Hogeland, family of organ donor and donor recipient.\nThe Jackson-Madison County General Hospital encourages people to consider organ donation.

    "title": "Sports bodies should have their funding cut if they push gender ideology amid concerns about trans players, report says | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Governing bodies should have their funding cut if they fail to protect female sports amid concern about trans- gender players, a leading think-tank says. A report by the Policy Exchange warns that gender ideology is risking the fairness and safety of competitions for women and girls. The analysis, which is backed by athletes including Martina Navratilova, Sharron Davies and Daley Thompson, highlights the major physical advantages which biological males have over females. The winning woman at this year's London Marathon would have been beaten by the 231st ranked male, it found. And every British 'long course' swimming record set by an elite female swimmer has been beaten by a teenage boy. In addition, at least three female records set at 5k community Parkrun events are held by biological males. Martina Navratilova of the USA takes part in the Legends All Access Hour at the Australian Open tennis tournament at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, in 2020 Sharron Davies at the Beauty Awards in London, in 2019 The report highlighted concerns about 'gender self-ID', saying it 'fundamentally compromises fair and safe competition for women and girls within grassroots, amateur and elite sport'. Policy Exchange is now calling on sport governing bodies, the UK Government and the International Olympic Committee to restrict categories for women and girls to biological females at all levels of sport. Some 99.99 per cent of those taking part in sport and physical activity are not elite or professional, the report points out, meaning that grassroots competitions for females are 'much more likely' to be affected by the issue. In county athletics championships, the winning male from the slowest county in the 1,500m race in 2023 would have beaten the winning female in 27 out of 33 counties, the think-tank said. It recommends that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should require all national governing bodies to update their policies within 12 months to ensure that there is a protected female single-sex category – and that they should lose taxpayer funding if they fail to do so. Policy Exchange also says that Parkrun should be ordered to collect participant data based on biological sex and not gender identity, and update all relevant course records to reflect this within 12 months or lose tax- payer funding. Former Olympic swimmer Ms Davies said: 'There is a sense within sports policy that while we should protect the female category within elite sports, women and girls participating and competing at amateur levels should budge over. Former British decathlete Daley Thompson at the Laureus World Sports Awards ceremony at the Verti Music Hall in Berlin, Germany, in 2020 'They must 'be kind' and 'inclusive' while having to pretend it is not grossly unfair, demotivating and possibly unsafe to accommodate biological males within their races, teams and sports days. 'Every sport, at every level, from grassroots to elite, must ensure that the female category is ringfenced for biological females.' Ms Navratilova, the former world No 1 female tennis player and an 18-time grand slam champion, said: 'Female sport must be protected otherwise we risk not only alienating a generation of women, but also taking away dreams and possibilities of fairness and winning for girls and women.' Daley Thompson, two-time Olympic gold medallist in the decathlon, said: 'We risk alienating a generation of young female athletes if we cannot promise them fair and safe play from the grassroots level to the top. 'Categories exist to allow everyone the chance to participate, and the willingness to compromise this by policymakers within sport is a scandal.' A spokesman for Sport England, which is responsible for developing grassroots sport, said: 'In 2021, the Sports Council Equality Group published Transgender Inclusion in Domestic Sport Guidance. While it is up to sports to set their own rules, we work closely with all organisations we fund to ensure they meet all the agreed criteria and code for sports governance. 'In this challenging and emotive area of policy, we understand and accept that there are a wide range of personal views, and we urge respectful discourse on this matter, and that sports consider their duty of care to all athletes.'",

    "text": "Our take: The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card offers 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%), with no annual fee, making it lucrative for small businesses. However, businesses exceeding the $50,000 spending cap per calendar year will earn a reduced cashback rate of 1% on the remainder, and it may offer fewer perks compared to some other business credit cards . Card type: Business To view rates and fees of the American Express Blue Business Cash Card, see this page The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is designed to simplify and reward everyday business spending. It boasts a generous welcome bonus of $250 statement credit after you make $3,000 in purchases on your card in your first 3 months of card membership. Plus, earn an additional $250 statement credit after spending an additional $10,000 within the first year. Beyond this welcome bonus, the card earns 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%). One of its key highlights is the absence of an annual fee, making it an attractive choice for businesses looking to maximize rewards without incurring additional costs. Its cash-back rewards structure is also ideal for those who want to earn rewards without researching the best way to use them. Cashback is simply deposited as a statement credit, eliminating the need to figure out the best redemption option. Moreover, the card extends various benefits beyond its cashback rewards, including secondary rental car insurance , access to the Amex Global Assist hotline, extended warranty and purchase protection. Cardholders can also take advantage of Amex Offers, which provide discounts and savings opportunities with select merchants. The combination of its simple rewards system, lack of an annual fee and practical perks makes the American Express Blue Business Cash Card a solid choice for businesses seeking a no-frills yet rewarding credit card. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is an excellent fit for small to mid-sized businesses looking for simplicity and value in their credit card rewards. It caters well to businesses with diverse spending needs, offering a flat 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%), eliminating the hassle of dealing with rotating categories or complex redemption processes. This card provides a straightforward and cost-effective solution for entrepreneurs and business owners seeking a streamlined approach to earning rewards on everyday operational expenses. Overall, the Blue Business Cash Card is a solid option for those seeking uncomplicated yet rewarding cash-back benefits at no annual fee. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card may not be the best choice for businesses with annual spending exceeding $50,000. That’s because once the limit is reached, the cash-back rate drops to 1%. This may not be as lucrative for businesses with substantial expenses. Furthermore, businesses with significant spending on categories like travel might find better value in a travel rewards card that better caters to their needs. Those who shouldn’t get the Amex Blue Business Cash Card include business owners who either travel internationally or use their cards for spending originating abroad. The card imposes a 2.7% of each transaction after conversion to US dollars, making it a poor choice for this purpose. Lastly, the Amex Blue Business Cash isn’t the best choice for business owners who want to earn flexible rewards that can be maximized for premium award travel. Cash-back rewards can’t be optimized beyond their set value. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card has a straightforward rewards structure. New card members earn a $250 statement credit after you make $3,000 in purchases on your card in your first 3 months of card membership, plus another $250 after spending an additional $10,000 within the first year. While this is quite a steep spending requirement, it’s pretty attainable for most small businesses. In addition to the combined $500 in statement credits, the card earns 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%). All other spending beyond this threshold earns 1% cashback. This earn rate is great for businesses that want to earn elevated rewards on all purchases without having to track numerous category bonuses across multiple credit cards. Redeeming rewards with the American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is about as straightforward as it gets. Rewards are automatically applied as a statement credit within two billing statements following a purchase. This automatic redemption is great for those who seek simplicity rather than complicated redemption structures. While there’s value in earning points through a program like Amex Membership Rewards, maximizing the full value of these points requires a steep learning curve. Not everyone has the time, patience or desire to learn how best to use these points – even if doing so can open up significantly better redemption opportunities. With cash-back rewards that automatically post as statement credits, there’s no effort required whatsoever. To view rates and fees of the American Express Blue Business Cash Card, see this page If the American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card isn’t quite your cup of tea, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. We’ve chosen two cards that you might want to consider, which offer comparable rewards: The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express are both small business cards that offer similar reward structures and benefits. Both cards earn 2X rewards on the first $50,000 in spending every calendar year, then 1X after. The Blue Business Plus earns valuable Amex Membership Rewards points, while the Blue Business Cash earns cash back. Both cards have no annual fee and offer a welcome bonus for new cardmembers. The Blue Business Plus offers 15,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $3,000 in eligible purchases on the Card within your first 3 months of Card Membership. The Blue Business Cash is more generous, with up to $500 in cash back. Overall, the Blue Business Cash is great for straightforward cash-back rewards, while the Blue Business Plus is better for earning and maximizing travel rewards. The Capital One Spark Miles for Business is a great alternative to the American Express Blue Business card if you want travel benefits and unlimited flexible rewards. Similar to the Blue Business Cash, the Spark Miles for Business card earns a flat rate on all spending: 2 miles per $1 spent on all purchases, without limits. Cardholders also earn 5 miles per $1 spent on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. The card also offers a welcome bonus of 50,000 miles if you spend $4,500 in first 3 months. These rewards are worth $500 when redeemed for direct travel purchases or you can transfer them to one of 18 airline or hotel transfer partners for even more value. The Spark Miles for Business has a $95 annual fee, which is waived the first year , presenting a great opportunity to test the card out risk-free for a year to decide if it’s worth keeping long-term . The card also includes a $100 travel credit towards Global Entry or TSA Precheck application fees every four years. Foreign transaction fees are also waived, making this an ideal option for business owners who travel often or spend significantly with merchants located abroad. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card can be a solid choice for small business owners seeking simplicity in their rewards. The card suits those who want to earn elevated cash-back rewards on everyday business expenses without tracking category bonuses or worrying about annual fees. Its 2% cash-back rewards structure can be significant for businesses with varied spending. Furthermore, the card’s $500 welcome bonus is generous for a cash-back rewards card, providing a nice incentive for new cardholders. However, the card’s 2% cash-back bonus is restricted to the first $50,000 spent per calendar year. Beyond this threshold, cardholders will earn just 1% cash back. Thus, the card may not be ideal for businesses with expenses exceeding $50,000 or those whose spending habits fall into specific categories. For example, if you spend substantially on shipping and advertising every year, you might be better off with an Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. The card earns 3x points per $1 (up to $150,000 combined) spent on shipping purchases, internet, cable, phone, and advertising with social media sites and search engines. Additionally, if your business involves travel or spending originating abroad, the Amex Blue Business Cash isn’t the most cost-effective choice. The card incurs a 2.7% foreign transaction fee, which negates the value of the cash back earned. Moreover, businesses requiring more extensive travel perks and protections might be better off with a premium business card like the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card requires good to excellent credit, making it somewhat hard to get approved. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is a cash-back rewards card for small businesses. The credit limit for an American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card will vary depending on your creditworthiness, income and business history. As a result, the credit limit will vary by customer.
