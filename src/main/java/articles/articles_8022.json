    "text": "The famous cricket player, Mohammed Siraj, recently celebrated his 30th birthday. A favourite among many, this talented bowler recently visited his hometown in Hyderabad, Telangana. The Board of Control for Cricket in India or the BCCI recently filmed a short video of him in his hometown. He regaled the viewers with anecdotes and memories of his childhood days and even got a bit emotional about all that he had to experience during his struggle days.\nMohammed Siraj Visits His Locality In Hyderabad\n🏠 𝙃𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡 𝙛𝙩. 𝙈𝙤𝙝𝙖𝙢𝙢𝙚𝙙 𝙎𝙞𝙧𝙖𝙟\nAs he celebrates his birthday, we head back to Hyderabad where it all began 👏\nThe pacer’s heartwarming success story is filled with struggles, nostalgia and good people 🤗\nYou’ve watched him bowl, now…\n[pic.twitter.com/RfElTPrwmJ]\n— BCCI (@BCCI)\n[March 13, 2024]\nMohammed Siraj celebrated his birthday this year in his hometown. And the best part? He took his fans along with him. Siraj showed BCCI TV around his hood in Hyderabad. He even showed his neighbourhood in Hyderabad called Eidgah.\nHe showed people the ground where he grew up playing cricket and also his favourite chai spot in the city. At one point in the video, he gets a little sentimental while sharing that he used to work as a catered and helped his father, an autorickshaw driver who was the sole earning member of the family.\nHe said that he used to flip rumali rotis at the job till his hands burned. However, Siraj said he was grateful for the struggles and doesn’t regret it. He says that without those days of struggle, he perhaps wouldn’t have valued his success as much as he does now.\nAlso Read:\nMohammed Siraj Invited RCB Team To His Home To Relish Hyderabadi Biryani\nHere’s What His Fans Had To Say About This Touching Video\nThis literally made me emotional\n— Pallab🇮🇳 (@Pallab200205)\n[March 13, 2024]\nThe video won the hearts of many of his already-adoring fans.

    "title": "New Year Honours 2024: Sharon Livermore made MBE for services to victims of domestic abuse after her own experience",
    "text": "New Year Honours 2024: Sharon Livermore made MBE for services to victims of domestic abuse after her own experience Sharon Livermore, from Cambridge, has been made MBE for services to the victims of domestic abuse. Sharon, a recruitment consultant, was stalked by her then husband during her 18-month marriage, culminating in his attempt to kidnap her outside her workplace in 2015. She has since [founded Domestic Abuse Education](https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/news/i-married-a-monster-he-changed-on-our-9311634/) to train employers on how to support staff affected by abuse and encourage firms to create a “safe space”. Sharon, who is now director of Kameo Recruitment, said: “When I found out about the honour I just cried and cried. I felt completely overwhelmed. It has sunk in a bit, but it still doesn't feel real. “Hopefully it will help me open more doors to be able to speak to new people, and just get people to be aware that there is an issue with domestic abuse and that employers can make a really positive impact for their employees. “The main thing an employer can do is have a safe space. Unless the perpetrator works with the victim, which obviously does happen, you can create a safe space at work where victims can access support for specialist services, to be able to make choices to be able to leave the relationship potentially in a safe way. Or a place where they can just gain that knowledge that they don't have to know what the next steps look like for them. “I think employers don't realise that they can make a difference. They may think it's a home based issue, but it's not. It's everyone's business. I like to say any business can create a safe space, and make it easier for people to come forward and ask for support. And obviously, as part of that they can have education and training to be able to spot the signs in their colleagues and know how to signpost somebody and start what is often an awkward conversation.” Sharon has set up services to help domestic abuse victims after her own terrifying experiences. One day in 2015, Sharon confided in her boss that she was being stalked by her estranged husband and then reported it to the police. They arrested him and helped relocate her and her children to a place where they were safe. Weeks later, on November 4, Sharon was leaving the office and walking towards her car when she noticed the windows were unusually steamed up. As she got in, she spotted her picnic blanket, usually kept in the boot, was in the footwell. “I smelt aftershave. Something seriously wasn’t right here,” said Sharon She leapt out of her car and flipped the boot open to find her ex-husband, curled up inside, armed with knives and cable ties. He jumped out and chased Sharon, who was “frightened for her life”, as she ran back towards the office. He managed to grab her and she cowered down on the floor, trying to protect herself. But upon hearing her screams, a colleague rushed to her aid and managed to push him off. He ran to Sharon’s car and, as the engine was still running, he sped off, only to be arrested later by officers. He was found guilty of attempted kidnap, taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent and was sentenced to four years in prison. Sharon said: “What I went through has defined me, but in a good way. After living through an experience that is so fearful and traumatic, I'm not scared of things like other people potentially would be now. I was able to set up my own recruitment business and build a platform to deliver domestic abuse education. “I’m really excited about going to Buckingham Palace. I never thought that was something I would experience and just to be there and be around other people that have made a difference and have been honoured will be incredible.” Sharon won [Business Person of the Year](https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/business/winners-of-the-cambridge-independent-sme-cambridgeshire-busi-9332691/) at the 2023 Cambridge Independent Cambridgeshire Business Awards.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
