    "text": "Poor weather has repeatedly delayed the pollution-abatement operation for the wreck of the New Zealand naval survey ship HMNZS Manawanui , which grounded and sank off Samoa in October 2024, and New Zealand's representatives have declined to update local media on the amount of fuel left in her tanks.\nAfter the sinking, New Zealand's defense department initially said that Manawanui contained about one million liters of fuel in her tanks, and maintains that minimal amounts leaked out after the sinking. After several rounds of dive operations, a commercial contractor has recovered an estimated 340,000 liters of petroleum, the service confirmed to New Zealand outlet Stuff - but officials declined to say how much fuel remains on the ship.\nThe task was supposed to finish in January, but has taken longer than expected. The salvor continues to work on recovering remaining amounts of fuel from the vessel's tanks and compartments; conditions on scene are challenging, including periods of rough weather and a difficult location at the edge of the reef.\nThe ship will likely remain in place and become a part of the reef structure, New Zealand defense minister Judith Collins told local media. Despite local complaints about the smell of diesel fuel, the government of Samoa \"has decided it wants it to stay where it is,\" she said. Collins suggested that it will likely be a diving attraction when cleanup operations are completed, much like an artificial reef.\nHMNZS Manawanui went aground near a reef on the southern coast of Upolu, Samoa on October 5. The commanding officer ordered the 75 crewmembers aboard the vessel to abandon ship, and all made it safely to shore, despite rough surface conditions. Several of the survivors were injured while crossing a reef to reach safety, but all survived; the vessel caught fire and sank the next morning.\nManawanui will not be replaced, Collins confirmed in January, and her missions will be picked up by the patrol boat HMNZS Otago - a much smaller vessel lacking Manawanui's working deck and 100-tonne crane.",

We soon forget what we have not deeply thought about. –Marcel Proust, French Novelist This article continues a series a series of articles on 8 neuroscience-based principles that Jesus modeled for us that can profoundly improve our preaching and teaching. They are based on my latest book, If Jesus Gave a TED Talk: 8 neuroscience principles the Master Teacher used to persuade His audience. Today’s principle is Principle 5—Stimulate Long-Term Memory (Durability). *** It was a pleasant walk in the woods of the Jura mountains one summer morning in 1941 for Georges and his dog. After their walks, George de Mestral, an engineer and entrepreneur, would often pull from his trousers and from his dog’s fur several burs of the cocklebur flowering plant. On this particular day, the tenacity of the burs piqued his interest. He took a closer look and examined them under a microscope. He noticed that the small hooks on the burrs made them easily adhere to his pants and his dog’s hair. He wondered if he could make something useful from this discovery. Eight years and much research later, he was able to mimic the natural attachment from the burrs with two pieces of fabric with thousands of hooks and loops. This became a ubiquitous household item we now call Velcro (from the French words velours for color, and crochet for hook) that has revolutionized the fastener industry. He began to commercially produce the product with a company he formed in 1959. I liken long-term memory to Velcro because both are sticky. For learning to occur and for your listeners to actually remember your sermons, sermons must ‘stick’ in long-term memory, like Velcro, and they must be able to retrieve it. *** CONCENTRATE ON ENHANCING RECALL Every preacher should aim for durable learning, learning that sticks in long-term memory that can later be recalled from it. The saying, ‘Easy come, easy go,’ holds true for learning and memory as well. If learning is too easy, little gets learned. Leaning, which is necessary for spiritual growth, does not reach a stable state and stay there without effort on our part. It needs reinforcing or it fades. However, if we incorporate recall experiences in our sermons that make it a bit hard to recall the material, called desirable difficulty, durable learning more likely will occur. When our listeners must work harder to dig out a memory, understand it, puzzle over it, or make sense of it, they learn better. It’s also called ‘effort after meaning.’ This process prohibits simple storage in working memory and forces other relevant circuits to work harder, thus deepening the memory. But, it must not be too difficult. Not all difficulty is desirable. The goal of desirable difficulty is to make it a bit harder to recall learned material. Preachers must match the difficulty to the learner, making the challenge manageable, but not impossible. You’re after struggle, not failure. And the more often we recall, the more elaborate memory traces we create which connects that information to other content to improve recall. A husband and wife neuroscience team (Bjork and Bjork) developed the concept of desirable difficulty. It explains how retrieving information (i.e., testing yourself) helps you learn it better. And when we must exert effort to retrieve information, learning strengthens. Our brains retain what they work harder to obtain. Although it may seem counterintuitive, forgetting is necessary to remembering. We must forget in order to learn. Forgetting deepens learning because it helps the brain filter out distracting and unnecessary information and strengthen recall of what’s important. Memories don’t exist on opposite spectrums, totally forgotten to perfectly remembered. Rather, they can be described with two components, retrieval strength and storage strength. This is called the theory of disuse. Dr. Carole Yue explains this concept in this way. “Any item you encode into your memory can be described by two characteristics: storage strength and retrieval strength. Storage strength is a general measure of how well learned that item is, while retrieval strength measures how accessible the item is at that time. Storage strength increases monotonically—the more you are exposed to an item, the stronger the storage strength gets. One important thing to note is that storage strength does not have a direct effect on memory performance; the probability that you will be able to reproduce something from memory (e.g., a name or phone number) depends almost entirely on its retrieval strength.” She also explains that the very act of retrieving something from memory enhances retrieval strength. And the more difficult it is to retrieve it (desirable difficulty), the stronger the memory becomes. She says, “the more you forget something, the better you ultimately remember it!” So, a little forgetting helps us recall better. And that’s the goal we should set for our sermons, that our learners will be able to recall in the future what we intend for them to recall and act upon. Jesus knew how to strengthen recall. He mastered what William Barclay calls the, “unforgettable epigram,” a phrase that, “lodges in the mind and stays there, refusing to be forgotten.” One helpful way to deepen long-term memory is through testing and questions, which Jesus modeled. Jesus often tested His followers with questions, a common practice in that day used to discern how well students had learned the lesson being taught. For example, in Matthew 16 Jesus asked his disciples who others said He was and then asked them who they thought He was. Estimates of the number of questions recorded in the Gospels, depending on how you count them, range from 110 to 310. And in Jesus’ most famous sermon, the sermon on the mount (Mt 5-7) He asks fifteen questions and another six that His hearers might ask. In fact, the first recorded words of Jesus, when He was twelve, were two questions He posed to Mary and Joseph. “’Why were you searching for me?’ he asked. ‘Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house (Lk 2.49)?’” He always used questions with a purpose, to rouse interest, confront His critics, probe for motives, push for faith, promote reflection, prick the conscience, etc. He never used them as fillers or to simply promote good discussion. And, the Gospels record twenty individuals and twelve groups who even asked Jesus questions. Your communication setting may allow your learners to ask you questions. To the questions others asked Him, Jesus always responded with respect and attentiveness, never calling any question unnecessary or foolish. So consider ways to improve your listener’s long-term memory through your sermons. Next week we’ll unpack Principle 6: Engage the Heart (Emotion).

    "text": "EMCC hosting ‘etching’ event to prevent vehicle catalytic converter thefts BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - Catalytic converter thefts continue to be an issue nationwide. The devices contain valuable precious metals, making them a prime target for thieves to sell them on the black market. According to the [National Insurance Crime Bureau](https://www.nicb.org/news/news-releases/catalytic-converter-thefts-surge-nationwide-according-new-report), the nation experienced more than 64,000 catalytic converter thefts in 2022 alone. Leading the country in catalytic converter thefts were California and Texas. Experts say the problem is not getting any better. “Prices are still increasing – gold, silver, platinum, rhodium. The precious metals in the cats {catalytic converter} – it’s still increasing. It’s still in the market,” said Scott Kennard of [Darling’s Ford-VW-Audi](https://www.darlingsford.com/) in Bangor. He says it’s a problem hitting not just consumers but businesses and first responders. “Ambulances, delivery trucks, fire trucks – vehicles that don’t move often. Due to the supply chain interruption, we have had ambulances that have had to sit for six months with no parts,” he explained. Getting one replaced is going to cost you. “Generally, it can range from $1,000 to $1,300 but that’s just a rough idea,” said Nathan Paulauskas, a 2nd-year automotive technology student. Under a Maine law that went into effect in 2022, new and used vehicles sold by a dealer in the state must have a VIN number engraved on the catalytic converter. “It saves you a little bit of headache in case your catalytic converter does get stolen. Your VIN on your cat is going through this random junkyard. They may contact you and you might be able to get your cat back, and the person that stole it will also probably have to pay for the replacement of it.” Experts say while the VIN number may not make it less likely for the part to be stolen, it does make it harder to sell. “The recycling plants, if they receive a cat with a VIN {number} on it, they have to check that VIN out. If you’re caught with a truck full of catalytic converters that have VIN numbers on it, they can be cross-referenced in a database,” Kinnard said. Next week you can have your catalytic converter marked for free. Eastern Maine Community College is hosting an “Etch and Catch” program on Tuesday, April 23rd from 8 a.m. to noon. “The Criminal Justice Academy students are going to help liaison people over to our shop and the Automotive students are going to etch the converter per state law on the vehicles that need to have their converters etched,” said Chris Davis, automotive department chair at Eastern Maine Community College. “Etch and Catch” programs are popping up across the country, to aid in the recovery of the converters should they be stolen. Experts say drivers can take some simple steps to help prevent theft. “Vary your routine,” Kinnard said. “Thieves look for habits. Move your car around. Know your surroundings.” To pre-register for a specific timeslot email: Investigations.bmv@maine.gov. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
