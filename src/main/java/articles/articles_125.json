    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Brutal heat and daily storm chances continue MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - Dangerous heat and humidity will continue today and into Saturday with increasing storm chances through the weekend. HEAT ADVISORY A HEAT ADVISORY is in effect for the entire area from 11:00 AM through 8:00 PM on Friday. The combination of temperatures in the 90s and very high humidity will push the heat index to 105 to 110 from midday into the early evening. To stay safe during excessive heat, drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. TODAY The heat and humidity will push temperatures into the low-mid 90s again this afternoon with the heat index reaching 105-110. We’ll keep the risk of a few storms around this afternoon, mainly scattered in nature. If you have afternoon plans, make sure to stay updated with us on the First Alert Weather App! We’ll send you a push alert to your phone when storms are starting to fire up this afternoon. Similar to yesterday, storm chances will be at 30%. INTO THE WEEKEND This weekend will be a hot and humid one with the chance of afternoon showers and storms. The heat index will climb to near 110° in some spots Saturday afternoon. We’ll keep the scattered showers and storms around Saturday and Sunday afternoon with a 40% chance of rain for any outdoor plans. As we head into Sunday, temperatures will ease back just a tad, allowing highs to be a few degrees cooler. The heat index will still be noticeable, reaching 100-105 Sunday afternoon. NEXT WEEK Our forecast next week will be dependent on the tropics and that chance of development. The track of this tropics development could increase our rain chances by mid-week. For now, we continue to watch and wait with a few scattered showers and storms in the forecast. Of course, we will tweak the forecast as needed and let you know of those changes over the weekend. Enjoy your weekend and let us focus on the tropics for you. Copyright 2024 WMBF. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Four of the top-10 finishers on Stage 18 were all on Giant [Propel Advanced SL bikes](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/global/showcase/propel-advanced-sl) with [CADEX WheelSystems](https://www.cadex-cycling.com/global), with Mauro Schmid from Team Jayco AlUla finishing second. Berrade’s teammates Pablo Castrillo and Pau Miquel were also in the front group, finishing eighth and ninth respectively. Castrillo Climbs to New Heights Berrade’s victory follows two incredible stage wins from his teammate Castrillo, who broke through for his first pro victory on Stage 12 with a superb climbing display and solo attack in the final 10km. The 23-year-old was part of a 10-man break that went clear 27km into the shortest stage of this year’s Vuelta, a 137km race from Ourense to a summit finish atop Montaña de Manzaneda. That Stage 12 victory was the biggest win of Castrillo’s career to date, and also of his Giant-sponsored Spanish squad. It was an emotional day for the team, whose former team president and founder Manolo Azcona had passed away the previous day. “Honestly, I still don’t believe it,” said Castrillo, who wore his [Giant Rev Pro](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/global/showcase/rev-pro) helmet for the win. “I’ve won my first stage at the Vuelta. I’m going to dedicate the victory to my team, my family, and a very special person, Azcona, who died last night, and I was thinking about him today.” Three days later Castrillo struck again, launching a solo attack 3km from the summit finish of Stage 15 to Cuito Negru. In a thrilling battle with Russian Aleksandr Vlasov, the Spaniard proved strongest again, conquering the brutally steep 20 percent grades in the final kilometer to earn another career win in his home country. “I am speechless,” Castrillo said after the win. “Winning this second stage, on such a climb and with such tough rivals, is something incredible. It is something I will remember for the rest of my life.” Kern Pharma Shines Kern Pharma, a team that Giant has sponsored since the squad was founded in 2020 and has partnered with Giant for its [Grassroots development program](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/global/teams-and-riders/grassroots-program/289), was already riding high in the final week of its home nation grand tour. But the underdog squad wasn’t content to rest on their laurels, they had set their sights on achieving more. This time it was Berrade’s turn to score his first professional win. He and his teammates Castrillo and Miquel were also part of a 42-rider breakaway that formed early in Stage 18, a hilly route through the Basque Country of northern Spain. That group got whittled down as the riders tackled several categorized climbs on their way to the finish at Maestu-Parque Natural de Izki. Following a series of attacks and counter-attacks, a lead group of 13 survivors, including the Kern-Pharma trio of Berrade, Castrillo and Miquel, along with Team Jayco-AlUla rider Mauro Schmid, was set for the final showdown. Schmid, the Swiss national road champion, had been active throughout the Vuelta and already had an impressive second-place finish on Stage 13. That result came two days after his Jayco AlUla teammate [Eddie Dunbar won Stage 11](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/global/news/dunbar-takes-stage-win-at-vuelta-a-espana/29108), another big result for riders on Giant bikes. Hitting the final climb with 6km to go, Dutch rider Steven Kruijswijk was the first to attack. He was quickly joined by Berrade, and halfway up the climb the Spanish rider went solo. He continued to pour it on, gaining a 15-second gap and then holding it to the line to score his first professional win since he turned pro in 2019. “At the beginning of the Vuelta, our manager told me that I had to become famous,” Berrade said after his win. “I said that it’s difficult for me, because I’m not a big media guy, but I think with this victory maybe I have a chance.” Berrade Scores Third Vuelta Stage Win for Kern Pharma! donderdag 5 september 2024 Giant Four of the top-10 finishers on Stage 18 were all on Giant",

El día de ayer, directivos, docentes y personal de la institución en Felipe Carrillo Puerto, en el marco del día de la mujer, realizó un foro especializado y dirigido para las niñas de primero segundo y tercero, con el tema \"Logros y desafíos de la mujer adolescente en los albores del siglo XXI”, con la que estimularon su confianza. Lorena Noemí Ek Can, subdirectora de la escuela, destacó la importancia de abordar los desafíos que enfrentan las mujeres jóvenes debido a su género. En un mundo donde las adolescentes a menudo se enfrentan a obstáculos únicos, desde estereotipos de género hasta desigualdades sociales, la promoción de la confianza y la autosuficiencia se vuelve crucial para su desarrollo personal y académico. “Culturalmente sabemos, sobre todo en la zona maya que crecemos con una cierta educación, sexista y machista, donde la mujer siempre es inferior y el hombre es más que ella, eso nos limita y nos hace dependiente, por eso, la intención es de acara con ese círculo”. Sostuvo que el foro no solo proporciona un espacio para discutir estos temas pertinentes, sino que también sirve como una plataforma para inspirar a las estudiantes a superar las barreras y perseguir sus metas con determinación, porque se les empodera y concientiza del gran valor que tienen. “Con iniciativas como estas, la escuela busca no solo educar a las jóvenes en el aula, sino también empoderarlas para que se conviertan en líderes seguras y exitosas en su comunidad y más allá. La confianza en sí mismas es el primer paso hacia el éxito, y la Escuela Secundaria Leona Vicario está comprometida a ayudar a sus estudiantes a alcanzar su máximo potencial”. Aseveró que al fomentar un sentido de confianza en sí mismas y en sus habilidades, las está preparando para enfrentar los desafíos de la vida con valentía y determinación, no sólo en la edad que se encuentran, sino en cada proceso que se tengan que enfrentar, escolar, personal, familiar y hasta laboral.",
