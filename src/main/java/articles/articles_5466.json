    "text": "BHUBANESWAR: Responding to the letter of the leader of Opposition Naveen Patnaik, Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi said that he was also deeply anguished by the unfortunate incident when Lord Balabhadra slipped on charamala during Adapa pahandi on July 9.\nMajhi said soon after he came to know about the incident, he directed deputy chief minister Pravati Parida and Law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan to rush to Puri. “Besides, I had also directed everybody to ensure that such incidents do not recur,” he said.\nStating that Lord Jagannath is not only the symbol of Odia Asmita, the chief minister said that he is the Lord of the entire Jagat (Universe). The rituals and system of worship of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra is rare in the world, he stated.\nYour advice is accepted with honour, says Majhi to Naveen\nAcknowledging that the incident during the Adapa pahandi has saddened devotees around the world, Majhi said, “It is also natural for you to be disturbed over it. I am also deeply saddened over such an incident,” he said.\nThe chief minister said he has taken the letter of the Opposition leader with all seriousness. “We all will complete the Gundicha Yatra and services of the deities properly. Your advise is always accepted with honour,” he added.",

    "text": "We have another ideal weather week for fishing, so get out there and make the most of it! With cooler morning temperatures, the prime fishing hours will be during the most pleasant time of day, so you won’t need to head out too early or stay too late. Plus, the fall foliage has reached its peak in the high country and is expected to reach its peak in the coming weeks throughout the valley, offering stunning views to complement some fantastic fall fishing.\nSilver Creek—With the Creek now fully in fall mode, you can expect to see primarily Baetis, along with a few Mahogany duns, October caddis and midge hatching during the most pleasant time of day. The best surface feeding occurs in a brief window from mid to late afternoon. Hatches can vary from sporadic to prolific, depending on the weather and your location on the Creek. As always, when hunting surface feeders, use a long leader down to 6x and be sure to make perfect, drag-free presentations. If the wind picks up, adjust your strategy: Shorten your leader, use stouter tippet and try terrestrials. Nymphs and streamers remain effective options as well.\nThe Wood—October is an excellent time to fish the Wood. The cottonwoods are changing color and there are plenty of beautiful wild trout eager to take a fly. Insects have been most active between noon until the sun leaves the water. Look for fish in the tailouts, along the seams of fast water and in the slower, gently flowing sections. During peak hours, focus on surface feeders using a long leader paired with a small baetis or caddis pattern. If there are no risers, try covering the water with a Hecuba (Red Quill) and a small nymph trailing behind. Euro-style nymphing is also effective this time of year to help turn quick takes into hookups.",

    "text": "After 30 days in quarantine, three new penguins now call the [Ballarat Wildlife Park](https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8588737/wrestlers-visit-ballarat-wildlife-park-ahead-of-starrcast/) their home. Maverick, 10 months old, Rose, 10, and Stanley 7, are three male penguins who came from Melbourne Zoo as a part of the breeding program. Bird keeper Noel McKenzie said the integration of the three new little blue penguins had been a success when they were released into the penguin enclosure on Friday, July 5. \"It's gone absolutely amazing - when they were released into their habitat they went straight into the water, had a bit of an adventure and a swim around and they loved it,\" he said. \"We then let the rest of the colony out, they mingled really well and started swimming around in a big group together.\" Rose's name can confuse people but apparently, Rose's sex is confusing - originally thought to be female, Rose was called a few different names by his keepers at Melbourne - but Rose has stuck. Having the penguins at the [wildlife park](https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8681138/10-affordable-ballarat-family-adventures-in-winter-school-holiday/) is helping the species continue with a healthy population in Victoria. In the wild, little penguins are being threatened by feral cats and dogs, and climate change is impacting their food source. They have a breeding season in the wild, but in captivity, they can have eggs at any time. The three new penguins were brought in the help diversify the Ballarat colony, Mr McKenzie said. \"We're a part of a breeding program and this allows us to swap or trade our penguins with other zoos and sanctuaries and this is so we can breed them and have more baby penguins,\" he said. At the end of 2023, the park had one successful egg hatch - Felipe. \"Hopefully towards the end of the year we should have more,\" Mr McKenzie said. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "text": "MUMBAI (IANS)- Following the tragic demise of actress Shefali Jariwala, Payal Ghosh has made a startling revelation about her meeting with the late legendary actress Sridevi.\nReflecting on their encounter, Payal shared that Sridevi had once opened up to her about undergoing cosmetic surgeries due to her fear of ageing. She mentioned that the veteran actress, known for her timeless beauty, was deeply concerned about growing older.\nGhosh recalled, “It was in 2017 when I met her at a clinic in Oshiwara. It was a 2-minute conversation. I have always admired her looks and charm, which is why I asked her about her beauty secret. I was shocked to hear her say that she actually undergoes cosmetic surgeries because of her fear of ageing. Not just that, she also revealed how she literally starves herself to maintain weight and look fit.”\nPayal added, “That moment had a big impact on my life, and it was that very moment when I decided to stop all my skin treatments in 2017 itself after that conversation with her. I did not want my life to be like that.”\nPayal Ghosh criticized the use of skin treatments like Botox and fillers, claiming they are harming actors. Expressing her concern, the actress stated, “Earlier, it was Sridevi ji who did this, and now Shefali Jariwala is another shocking and tragic example of actors losing their lives way too early just because they try skin treatments like Botox, fillers, and others. It’s just so sad and unfortunate. These treatments are killing actors. I feel nothing is more important than life, right? I really hope actors learn a lesson from these kinds of unfortunate deaths and keep themselves away from such treatments and medicines.”\nThe ‘Kaanta Laga’ fame Shefali Jariwala passed away on the night of June 27. She had reportedly been taking various medications, including anti-ageing supplements. According to police officials, her blood pressure may have dropped after consuming the medicines on an empty stomach, causing a cardiac arrest.",

    "title": "Así serán las lluvias torrenciales que traerán a Barcelona granizo y tormentas | El Periódico",
    "text": "Tras unos días de calor extremo y temperaturas récord, la situación climática promete un cambio brusco en la mayor parte del territorio catalán, que acogerá tormentas a partir de este viernes. Un temporal que ha activado las alertas por inundación. A pesar de que este nuevo panorama meteorológico ha empezado con un ambiente soleado durante la primera mitad de la jornada del viernes, sin proponer grandes cambios respecto a los últimos días, todo puede cambiar durante las horas de tarde. \\\"Chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes a partir de medio día y acompañadas de granizo o piedra\\\", ha anunciado el servicio Meteocat a través de su cuenta de X (antes Twitter). La intensidad de estas tormentas se espera que empiece por los puntos de montaña del interior noreste y, más tarde, acabarán explotando por toda Catalunya central. De hecho, el Meteocat ha teñido el mapa catalán de alertas naranjas y amarillas, avisando de que algunos de estos chubascos pueden ir acompañados de \\\"considerable aparato eléctrico y localmente de fenómenos de tiempo violento\\\", predicen. Protección Civil también ha manifestado su preocupación por la agresividad del temporal que se acerca, activando el Plan de emergencias por inundaciones en Catalunya (INUNCAT), poniendo en alerta principalmente a las comarcas del Pirineo, Prepirineo, Catalunya Central y la Terra Alta, donde se prevé mayor intensidad. Según las previsiones del Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya (SMC), las precipitaciones podrán superar los 20 L por m2 en 30 minutos en dichos puntos de Catalunya. En otras comarcas como el Bages, el Berguedà, Lluçanes y Ripollès, se podrían superar los 40 L por m2 en media hora. En la ciudad de Barcelona se prevén fuertes tormentas a partir de las 19:00 h, pero sobre todo durante toda la noche, que no concederá descanso desde las 21:00 h hasta la 1:00 de la madrugada del sábado, según el Meteocat. En cuanto a las temperaturas, se espera que no desciendan demasiado. De hecho, las mínimas de la noche del viernes al sábado -y a pesar de las lluvias y el mal tiempo- no bajarán de los 26 °C, pasando la mayor parte de las horas de sueño entre los 27 y 28 °C. Durante la jornada del sábado no se esperan precipitaciones, además de las correspondientes a las primeras horas de la madrugada, que deberían cesar a partir de las 2:00 h. Asimismo, Barcelona podría acoger el domingo algún que otro chubasco, que según las predicciones del Meteocat se darían entre las 9:00 h y las 10:00 h de la mañana. Frente a la posibilidad de inundaciones, Protección Civil de la Generalitat ha publicado algunos consejos a través de su portal web para saber cómo enfrentarnos a las fuertes lluvias. Los más esenciales son los siguientes: Evitar los desplazamientos en vehículo y aparcar en rieras o puntos subterráneos inundables. No se deben de cruzar nunca ríos o rieras si bajan con agua, sobre todo en las zonas donde se esperan la intensidad y las acumulaciones más importantes.\\n Circular preferentemente por las rutas principales y las autopistas, moderar la velocidad y mantener las distancias de seguridad.\\n Si sorprenden precipitaciones en la montaña, lo mejor es dirigirse a puntos altos que estén lejos de los márgenes de ríos y de cauces de barrancos, ramblas o torrentes.\\n Si sorprenden precipitaciones importantes en casa: no bajar a las zonas inundables como el subterráneo, el garaje, etc.; no dejar fuera objetos o muebles que el agua pueda arrastrar; poner los animales domésticos, los alimentos, el agua potable, los documentos importantes, los objetos de valor y, sobre todo, los productos peligrosos (como veneno para ratas, disolventes, etc.) en lugares altos y protegidos.",
