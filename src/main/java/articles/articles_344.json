    "title": "Oxford, Cambridge fall in global college rankings - experts say it's a red flag for UK innovation",
    "text": "Top British universities fell in global rankings last week, with experts raising red flags about the region’s ability to continue attracting international talent and nurturing innovation.\nThe annual QS World University Rankings saw Britain’s elite Oxford and Cambridge universities drop one place to fourth and sixth, respectively. Meanwhile, 54 of 90 British universities fell in rankings. They include a number of leading ones, including the University of Edinburgh, which dropped seven places to 34th, and the London School of Economics and Political Science, which dropped six places to 56th.\nQS World University Rankings measured the performance of over 1,500 universities in more than 100 locations globally using metrics such as research and discovery, learning experience, employability, global engagement, and sustainability.\nHowever, Sankar Sivarajah, head of Kingston Business School, told CNBC Make It that despite the headline figures, there has been some progress: 17 of the 90 U.K. universities made the global top 100 and institutions such as Imperial College London, the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and University College London held their positions in the top 10.\n‘Intensifying global competition’ Nevertheless, “the sector faces significant challenges from intensifying global competition, declining research funding, and difficulties in improving metrics such as faculty-student ratio and internationalization,” Sivarajah said.\nHe explained that institutions in China, Singapore, and Australia are “making sustained investments in research, international partnerships, and faculty recruitment,” while the U.K. lags behind in those areas.\n“The UK must prioritize sustained investment in research and development, focus on graduate outcomes and employer reputation, and strengthen strategic global engagement to remain competitive,” he said.\nEdward Knight, president at venture capital firm Antler, added that the declining ranking, on top of a proposed 6% tax on foreign students studying at U.K. universities, could make the region a less attractive study destination.\n“What I hear at the same time … is that increasingly, in places like China and India, the narrative is shifting to ‘Hey, kids don’t go abroad to study anymore. You can stay at home.’ So the combination of that plus taxes to make it more expensive, for foreign students, is obviously not helpful,” Knight said.\n“If you’re putting taxes on people coming in around at the same time as there’s a growing hesitance to actually go and study abroad anyway, then that’s obviously not a particularly healthy set of drivers for the overall health of the ecosystem,” Knight added.\n‘Europe is significantly behind the rest of the world’ British universities falling behind in global rankings is also a wake-up call for the region’s tech and startup sector, which has persistently been seen as lagging behind the U.S. and China.\n“It’s all well and good saying the U.K. is the leading place for innovation in Europe, but I think that you’re going to get a more rounded, more balanced perspective if the reference set is actually broader than that,” Knight said.\nHe pointed out that artificial intelligence will be integrated into the national curriculum in China from primary school; the U.S. has the Stargate Project, an initiative investing $500 billion over the next four years to build AI infrastructure; and the Abu Dhabi launched MGX, an investment firm for AI technologies.\n“I think what you would probably conclude is that it’s all fine being on top of the pile in Europe, but Europe is significantly behind the rest of the world,” Knight added.\nKnight noted that Cambridge University has produced some of the region’s finest tech companies, including DeepMind and Darktrace, but that the U.K. has lost those firms to the United States. Darktrace was bought by a private equity firm in the U.S., while DeepMind was sold to Google.\n“For some reason, these companies feel that they are better domiciled in the United States, but also because the growth multiple, the growth valuation the market in the U.S. puts in these companies is higher than it is in the UK,” Knight said.\n“Revolut is probably a $50 billion company. Are they going to go public in the United States or are they going to stay here? Spotify came out of Stockholm, but it’s listed on the NASDAQ. If you want to host these businesses and companies, you need to be able to provide a new, more supportive environment,” he added.",

Patients are allocated a triage category based on the time in which they need medical attention - however, these benchmarks are not always met.\nIn February 2025, 56% of patients presenting at Canberra Hospital emergency department received treatment within the recommended time frame. The recommended time frames, and percentage of patients who received treatment within that time frame, are listed below.\nTriage category Recommended time % seen on time 1 - Resuscitation Less than 2 minutes 98.5% 2 - Emergency Within 10 minutes 62.3% 3 - Urgent Within 30 minutes 45.3% 4 - Semi-urgent Within 60 minutes 61.6% 5 - Non-urgent Within 120 minutes 86.1% The data above represents admissions to Canberra Hospital in February 2025.\nOther factors can also affect how long you wait at the emergency department, including:\nPatient volume Stagging shortages Day of the week Time of the day or night Critical incidents or mass casualties When to go to the ED vs when to go to the doctor The emergency department is intended for serious and urgent medical conditions. Some common reasons for attending the emergency department include:\nHeart attack or stroke Severe unexplained pain Serious injuries or broken bones Problems with breathing or bleeding Loss of consciousness or fitting Allergic reactions Severe mental health concerns Drug overdoses or poisoning Burns or near-drowning incidents Pregnancy complications This list is not exhaustive and if you think your life is at risk, you should call 000 for help immediately. However, there are lots of alternatives for situations that not require urgent or emergency healthcare, including:\nWalk-in clinic or urgent care clinic An after-hours home visit from a doctor Speak with your GP or pharmacist Call Healthdirect on 1800 022 222 (known as NURSE-ON-CALL in Victoria) Call a mental health service such as Beyond Blue for non-urgent mental health advice Comparing public and private ED options in Canberra In February 2025, Canberra Hospital emergency department had an average wait time of 30 minutes, while North Canberra Hospital emergency department had an average wait time of 20 minutes.There are no emergency departments within private hospitals in Canberra.\nFAQs What is the average emergency department wait time at Canberra Hospital?

There are no fully operational private emergency departments in Canberra but Calvary Bruce Private Hospital does offer some emergency care.\nWhen should I go to the ED vs a walk-in clinic? The emergency department is for life-threatening or serious conditions. Walk-in centres are for minor illnesses, infections and injuries.\nHow can I check Canberra ED wait times? Canberra Health Services updates emergency department wait times in real time. You can check them on the ACT government website.\nDo I need private health insurance for emergency care? No, you don't need private health insurance for emergency care. It's covered by Medicare . However, if you go to a private emergency department, you will likely incur some out-of-pocket costs.",
