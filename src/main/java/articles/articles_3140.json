    "title": "Man Survives 8 Days Lost in the Jungle with Broken Hip and Leg",
    "text": "Posted 24 minutes ago Picture from responders. A man has narrowly escaped death after being lost in the jungle for eight days, surviving on nothing but water while immobilised by a broken hip and leg. Mr Neramit Luangaromfa, District Chief of Sai Yok in Kanchanaburi Province, revealed that authorities were alerted to the case on January 22. Village headman Chamnarn Saengpetchon reported that Mr Chinawat, a 31-year-old resident of Ban Thung Kang Yang village, had ventured into the forest within the Sri Nakarin Dam National Park alone to forage on January 16 and subsequently went missing. Family members and locals had been searching for Mr Chinawat since his disappearance, but to no avail. Upon receiving the report, Mr Neramit coordinated efforts involving the village headman, national park officials, municipal protection units, the Pitakkarn Foundation rescue team, relatives, and residents to launch a deeper search into the mountainous forest. On the evening of January 22, search teams discovered a plastic bag containing food hanging from a tree and Mr Chinawat’s parked motorcycle, but there was no sign of the man himself. Believing he had wandered deeper into the forest, search operations were paused due to darkness, with plans to resume the following morning. At 08:00 on January 23, the search intensified. A 20-person ground team combed the dense forest while another group of 15 used four-wheel-drive vehicles to patrol nearby trails, hoping Mr Chinawat might emerge on foot. At 10:30 the ground search team found Mr Chinawat lying injured and exhausted in the mountainous forest. Though weak and dazed, he was still able to communicate. He was found with a broken leg and fractured hip, injuries sustained when he fell from a tree while foraging. Despite his severe injuries, Mr Chinawat survived for eight days by drinking water, with no food available. Rescuers transported him out of the forest and handed him over to the Pitakkarn Foundation’s emergency medical team, which rushed him to Somdet Phra Piyamaharaj Rommaniethaket Hospital. Doctors have reported that Mr Chinawat is in a stable condition but will remain under close medical observation. -- 2025-01-24",

    "text": "The infamous Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, have put their legendary spat behind them, [revealing plans for a tour next year](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/ticket-prices-oasis-live-25-9517393), ushering in waves of excitement among Oasis aficionados. Perhaps less well known is the fact that famously outspoken younger Gallagher brother Liam has also been involved in a spat with [pop sensation Peter Andre](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/). Cast your mind back to 2007, when Liam was probed on ITV Mobile's The Hot Desk regarding which celebrity out of news icon Trevor McDonald, country legend Dolly Parton, and [the 'Mysterious Girl' vocalist](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/peter-andre-shares-amazing-moment-9512399) he would choose to ignore, text, or work with. Liam, showcasing his characteristic style, answered: \"I'd call Trevor McDonald, I'd text Peter Andre and I'd ignore Dolly Parton. The only reason I'd text Peter Andre is to say, 'What the f*** are you on about man? Where'd you get my f***ing number from, you f***ing p***y c***?\" READ MORE Later that year, Peter told new! Magazine: \"I read somewhere that Liam Gallagher has been calling me all sorts of names. I found this quite surprising because when I last saw Liam he couldn't have been friendlier to me and Katie [Price]. \"I'd go as far as to say that he was totally up our backsides! We bumped into him at a Radio 1 event and he told us how great he thought we were and how his mother Peggy was a big fan. It's such a shame he was too much of a coward to tell us how he really felt to our faces instead of being two-faced. That man is all mouth and no trousers!\" Fifteen years after their disagreement, [reports OK!](https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/peter-andres-unlikely-bust-up-33547991) Peter wrote about how he and Liam had finally made amends in his column for new! In 2022, he said: \"Last week, the Loose Women were talking about unusual meetings with celebs. Coleen Nolan's was with Oasis's Noel Gallagher, who tapped her on the shoulder in Euston Station and said 'My mum would kill me if I didn't say hello to you!' \"It made me think of my encounter with Noel's brother, Liam Gallagher. He once said some harsh things about me in an interview. I took it on the chin, as I'd been told it's his nature. \"A while later, I bumped into him and he not only apologised, but praised me for being a great father and for my relationship with my kids. I didn't expect it! I knew about his 'tough guy' bravado, but we talked about our families.

    "title": "Is Baltimore Finally Restoring Tough School Grading Policies? – HotAir",
    "text": "It's no secret that the public school system in Baltimore, Maryland has been a mess for a while now. Endemic issues of perpetual absenteeism, permissive teachers, and high rates of students failing to meet state minimums in reading and math have plagued the schools. The situation grew worse during and after the pandemic, with standards for grading and attendance being reduced dramatically or removed entirely. Unfortunately, the situation has not bounced back noticeably since the pandemic passed. But is that finally about to change? CBS News in Baltimore reports that the Anne Arundel County Public School system is bringing back grading regulations this year that will be tougher and \"put more emphasis on student responsibility.\" Let's find out what that actually means.\nAdvertisement The Anne Arundel County Public Schools are altering their grading regulation that will put more emphasis on student responsibility.\nSuperintendent of Schools Dr. Mark Bedell said the alterations will start this upcoming school year which will focus on increasing student responsibility and providing more time for teachers to focus on instruction...\nAt the middle and high school levels, the grading scale now defines an E as 50% to 59%\n\"Just as our teachers have a responsibility to deliver quality instruction, our students have a responsibility to get their work done on time,\" Dr. Bedell said. \"Our school system granted a great deal of leniency during the pandemic, but the pandemic is over and we need to strengthen the regulations and allow teachers to focus on instruction and not as many re-dos of student work.\"\nThe linked report has a full list of summaries of the changes. Much of this sounds like it carries the potential for improvement, but the devil is always in the details, as the saying goes. During the pandemic, they instituted a program of \"re-dos.\" If a student is given an assignment and they completely fail at it or don't even return it, they are given the opportunity to review the material and try again, hopefully producing a better score that can be recorded. That seems generous, but it's better than simply giving them a passing grade if they don't even bother returning the work, which was happening for a while. But it's not being eliminated. They're simply reducing the number of times they can do this during any grading period by one.\nAdvertisement The schools will continue to accept late returns of assignments, but a penalty will be assigned to the final score. That seems okay. Teachers will still be able to determine that a student made a \"good faith effort\" to complete an assignment and qualify for a 50% grade. That means that many will still receive a \"passing\" grade of \"E\" because they have to fall below 50% to qualify for an F.\nThis still sounds extremely sloppy and it leaves the door open for individual teachers and counselors to give a free pass to children who were either not properly provided with the material needed to succeed, failed to put in the effort, or simply didn't show up. So is the Superintendent of Schools truly \"fixing things\" and attempting to raise the standards? Or is he getting the media to paint a picture making it look like he's trying to fix them ? Sadly, the details strongly suggest the latter.\nThey needed to do something, or at least look as if they were doing something, because the families that really care and want their children to succeed have been complaining, and for good reason. Hard work is required for anyone to get ahead in this world and that's always been the case. But there aren't many colleges that will accept applicants with lower percentile scores and if their records have been faked, they won't last when it becomes obvious that they can't master even the most basic coursework. Entry-level jobs with even minimal educational requirements will rarely be given to someone who can't even fill out the job application correctly. Beyond that, what options are left for young people trying to enter the workforce today? Back in my day, you could at least go to work on a farm, but much of that work has been automated in the modern era. And even if you find such a position, you don't build up generational wealth that way unless your family owns the business. All that may leave for these kids is a place with the gangs on the streets. And the public school system may be unwittingly feeding more grist into that terrible mill.\nAdvertisement",
