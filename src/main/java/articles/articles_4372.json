    "text": "國家主席習近平在北京人民大會堂，會見來華舉行中國歐盟領導人會晤的歐洲理事會主席科斯塔，以及歐盟委員會主席馮德萊恩。\n習近平指出，中歐建交50年來，交流合作成果豐碩，既成就彼此又惠及世界，其中的重要經驗與啟示就是相互尊重、求同存異、開放合作、互利共贏，這亦是中歐關係未來發展應該堅持的重要原則及努力方向。他說面對加速演進的世界百年變局及變亂交織的國際形勢，中歐領導人要再次展現遠見及擔當，作出符合人民期待、經得起歷史檢驗的正確戰略抉擇。\n習近平強調，中歐都是主張多邊主義、宣導開放合作的建設性力量，國際形勢越是嚴峻複雜，中歐就越要加強溝通、增進互信、深化合作，以穩定健康的中歐關係為世界提供更多穩定性和確定性。",

    "title": "Arsenal denied a return to Premier League summit as they are beaten by West Ham",
    "text": "Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy. The Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium. His West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up. A second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya. Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot. Arsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table. Instead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances. Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular. But at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle. Jarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback. Arsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola. Paqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller. The hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle. Former West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after. Mavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour. Jesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench. Areola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner. Rice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",

    "text": "An employee of Chinese home appliance maker Midea Group inspects air conditioners at a workshop in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, in March. [PHOTO/XINHUA] This summer, many have received a text message from the power company suggesting that they set their air conditioners to 26 degrees Celsius or higher in order to save energy, a message that many have ignored.\nData show that when the air conditioner is set to cooling mode, every degree above the recommended 26 degrees Celsius can save at least 4 to 15 percent of energy. Nationally, this could alleviate some of the increased electricity demand, predicted to exceed 100 million kilowatts this summer.\nBut currently air conditioning control in China relies largely on the self-discipline of residents and businesses, which could improve by upgrading to systematic AC load management that can save energy costs, enhance grid regulation and ensure stable electricity supply during peak summer periods without compromising on comfort or safety. Especially, as public institutions and commercial/industrial entities consume large amounts of energy through their ACs, the power sector can remotely adjust AC temperatures to reduce peak load pressures, ensuring reliable electricity for essential services and key enterprises.\nRelevant energy departments can also guide large power consumers to upgrade old equipment and promote devices such as energy-saving ACs and ice storage ACs. Major AC users, such as commercial complexes and office buildings, are encouraged to collaborate with professional energy service providers and apply innovative digital technologies like artificial intelligence, utilize smart building energy management platforms, and explore AC control strategies based on human comfort algorithms.\nStrengthening AC energy-saving is crucial for ensuring electricity supply during peak summer periods and requires public participation, which in turn requires promoting public awareness through various forms of communication.\n-ECONOMIC DAILY",

    "text": "Flight operations continued to be impacted by dense fog at the Delhi airport for the third day on Thursday, with nearly 60 flights getting diverted and scores getting delayed during this period. Airport sources said a total of 58 flights, the majority of them operated by domestic carriers, were diverted due to bad weather between 0000 hours of December 25 to 0600 hours of December 28. Most of the flights had to be diverted, as the pilots were not trained to operate flights in low visibility conditions, the sources claimed. As many as 13 flights of IndiGo were diverted while 10 flights each of Air India and SpiceJet were diverted during the period. Among others, 5 flights of Vistara, 3 flights of Akasa Air and 2 flights of Alliance Air were diverted at the Delhi airport. The flights were diverted to Jaipur, Lucknow and Indore, among other airports. On Wednesday, Delhi airport issued a fog alert on social media platform X. \\\"While landing and takeoffs continue at Delhi Airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected. \\\"Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted,\\\" it had said. Similar alerts were issued on Tuesday also. CAT III pertains to flight operations in low visibility conditions. The Delhi airport is the country's largest airport and handles more than 1,300 flights daily. In the past few days, the national capital has been witnessing dense fog, especially in the early morning hours. Ready, set, travel: The holiday rush to the airports and highways is underwaySo far this year, airlines have canceled 1.2 per cent of U.S. flights, down nearly half from 2.1 per cent over the same period last year. Cancellations were well below 1 per cent during Thanksgiving, according to FlightAware. Canceled flights surged last year, as airlines were caught short-staffed when travel rebounded from the pandemic more quickly than expected. Since then, U.S. airlines have hired thousands of pilots, flight attendants and other workers, and the cancellation rate has come down.See More Details",
