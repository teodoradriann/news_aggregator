    "text": "A Estação de Tratamento de Água (ETA) Guandu, em Nova Iguaçu, atingiu um recorde histórico de produção de água tratada, alcançando a marca de 44,6 mil litros por segundo. O volume supera a capacidade máxima do plano verão e a média de produção fora da alta temporada.\nA Cedae e as concessionárias responsáveis pela distribuição de água implementaram uma operação estratégica para atender à alta demanda do período de festas de fim de ano, quando o Rio de Janeiro recebe milhões de turistas.\nA operação recorde foi possível graças aos investimentos realizados em 2024, como a aquisição de novos motores e melhorias eletromecânicas no Sistema Guandu. “A produção extraordinária é acionada estrategicamente durante períodos de alta demanda para atender às necessidades com eficiência. Contudo, para assegurar o pleno funcionamento da ETA Guandu, esse modelo não pode ser mantido de forma contínua. Essa medida é adotada para reforçar a segurança hídrica da população”, explicou Aguinaldo Ballon, diretor-presidente da Cedae.\nA operação especial será mantida até o fim do ano, garantindo o abastecimento durante o Réveillon em Copacabana e demais eventos na cidade.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Israeli tanks advance deep into Gaza town after strikes cause new mass exodus",
    "text": "Cairo/Gaza: Israeli tanks advanced deep into a town in the central Gaza Strip on Thursday after days of relentless bombardment that forced tens of thousands of already displaced Palestinian families to flee in a new exodus.\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij, the armoured contingent having apparently advanced from orchards on the eastern outskirts.\nFurther south, Israeli forces struck the area around a hospital in the heart of Khan Younis, the Gaza Strip's main southern city, where residents feared a new ground push into territory crowded with families made homeless in 12 weeks of war.\nPalestinian health authorities said 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1 per cent of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead are feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nIsrael has escalated its ground offensive in Gaza sharply since just before Christmas despite public pleas from its closest ally the United States to scale the campaign down in the closing weeks of the year.\nIt launched the war to destroy the militant Islamist Hamas movement that runs Gaza after fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Of the hostages, 110 were freed during a short truce in late November and another 23 have now been declared dead in absentia, an Israeli government spokesperson said on Thursday.\nThe main focus of fighting is now in central areas south of the wetlands that bisect the narrow coastal strip, where Israeli forces have ordered civilians out over the past several days as their tanks close in.\nTens of thousands of people fleeing the densely packed Nusseirat, Bureij and Maghazi districts were heading south or west on Thursday into the already overwhelmed city of Deir al-Balah along the Mediterranean coast, crowding into hastily built camps of makeshift tents.\n\"Over 150,000 people - young children, women carrying babies, people with disabilities & the elderly - have nowhere to go,\" the main U.N. organisation operating in Gaza, UNRWA, said in a social media post.\nThe eastern part of Bureij was a theatre of heavy fighting on Thursday morning, with Israeli tanks thrusting in from the north and east, residents and militants said.\n\"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members.\n\"We are now in a tent in Deir al-Balah because of this brutal Israeli war,\" he told Reuters by phone, declining to give a second name for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad, living in a school in Deir al-Balah since fleeing from the north, said the people who were newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nWith food running out, he said he had made a perilous trip to Rafah near the Egyptian border to buy a 25-kg (55-lb) sack of flour for his family.\nFighting near hospital in Khan Younis\nKhan Younis, where Israeli forces advanced this month after a truce collapsed on Dec. 1, also came under heavy bombardment on Thursday morning from warplanes and tanks near the al-Amal hospital, west of Israeli positions.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent, which runs the hospital and has its headquarters nearby, said 10 Palestinians were killed and 12 wounded in one bombardment there, the third strike targeting the area around the hospital in less than an hour.\nResidents said they believed Israeli forces were trying to provoke a new exodus ahead of a further ground assault.\nNearby at Nasser Hospital, the main medical centre in Khan Younis and largest still functioning in Gaza, women and children shrieked as the dead and wounded were brought in.\nA toddler lay motionless on a cot while medics tried to revive him; one doctor nodded \"no,\" signalling the boy was dead.\nIsrael reported three more of its soldiers killed, bringing its toll in the ground campaign to 169. The past week has seen some of its heaviest losses of the war so far.\nVirtually all of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been driven from their homes at least once and many have been forced to flee several times. Only a handful of hospitals still function.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Israeli military said it \"regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\" from a Dec. 24 air strike on the Maghazi refugee camp that killed 70 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nThe military statement said warplanes struck two targets \"adjacent\" to where Hamas militants were operating, and a preliminary inquiry showed that further buildings nearby were also hit, \"which likely caused unintended harm to additional uninvolved civilians\".\n\"The IDF ... is acting to draw conclusions and learn lessons from this event,\" it added.\nThe Palestinian health ministry denounced the attack as a massacre in a crowded residential square.\nOver the course of the war, The Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas or using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nU.S. President Joe Biden warned earlier this month that \"indiscriminate bombing\" in Gaza jeopardised sympathy for Israel among its allies. Washington has said Israel should make a transition from full-scale ground war to a targeted campaign against Hamas leaders.\nEgypt, which has acted as a mediator including hosting the leader of Hamas last week, said it had put forward a proposal to end the bloodshed, including a three-stage plan for a ceasefire, but had yet to hear the warring sides' responses.\nIsrael says it will not halt its ground campaign until it annihilates Hamas, describing this as its only option to safeguard its security and free remaining hostages.\nPalestinians say wiping out Hamas is an unachievable aim given the militant group's diffuse structure and deep roots in a territory it has ruled since 2007.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 28 December 2023, 21:35 IST)",
