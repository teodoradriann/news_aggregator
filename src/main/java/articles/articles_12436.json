    "text": "Ipswich Town vs Brighton and Hove Albion. Premier League.\nPortman RoadAttendance29,403.\nIpswich 0-2 Brighton: Joao Pedro avoids red card as Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter ends Seagulls' winless Premier League run\nMatch report and free highlights as Brighton end eight-game Premier League winless run with 2-0 victory at Ipswich; Joao Pedro avoids red card for clash with Christian Walton; Kaoru Mitoma gave Brighton lead six minutes later before Georginio Rutter sealed win\nThursday 16 January 2025 22:27, UK\nBrighton ended their eight-game winless run in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Ipswich - in a game where the decision not to send Joao Pedro off was the major talking point.\nWith the Seagulls frustrated by Ipswich at the start of the second half, Brighton forward Pedro appeared to jump into home goalkeeper Christian Walton off the ball while trying to catch a back-pass.\nReferee Tony Harrington delayed his decision before brandishing a yellow card, with VAR agreeing with the call.\nThe incident became even more significant when, six minutes later, former Brighton goalkeeper Walton let Kaoru Mitoma's shot go through his hands and into the net to break the deadlock of a slow-starting game.\n\"I've not watched it back. I think he's left a little bit on the goalkeeper. I think he knows what he's doing,\" said Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna. \"It's football, it happens.\n\"The referee gives the yellow card and dealt with it. It's not something that we're going to cry about too much.\"\nAsked about the incident, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler said: \"He comes too late, yes. He has no bad purpose, he doesn't want to hurt him. I don't see a red card for this challenge.\"\nBrighton then made changes to consolidate their authority on the game and one of the substitutes in Georginio Rutter doubled the lead with a clever flick from a set-piece. VAR checked whether Lewis Dunk was obscuring Walton's view as the shot went in, but deemed the Brighton defender onside.\nThat second goal was particularly damaging for Ipswich as it took them back into the relegation zone on goal difference. McKenna's side failed to make use of a slack Brighton first half, with Nathan Broadhead, Liam Delap and Omari Hutchinson all denied by solid Bart Verbruggen stops.\nFor Brighton, however, the victory lifts them into the top half and ends their longest winless run since December 2021, when Graham Potter's Seagulls went 11 games without a win.\nThe big incident - have your say!\nPedro has been there before...\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\nIt is not the first time Joao Pedro has been involved in an incident where his intent is being questioned.\nOn December 27, Pedro avoided a red card against Brentford despite swinging his elbow out at Brentford's Yehor Yarmoliuk. The Brazilian did not make contact with the midfielder, even though the Laws of the Game state that \"attempting to use excessive force\" warrants a sending off.\nHow does this compare to this situation? It's a tough one to call and referee Tony Harrington did take his time in making his mind up, despite calls from Ipswich players and fans at Portman Road to take the strongest action possible.\nPedro appears to jump into Walton - which could be deemed excessive - but is the Brighton forward trying to get out the way of the goalkeeper? As soon as Harrington branded the yellow card, it would have been difficult for VAR to overturn it.\nBut it still feels right to say that Pedro is lucky. Another referee may have taken a harder sanction.\nMcKenna: First goal changed the game\nIpswich manager Kieran McKenna:\n\"I thought we had more threat and got the ball in better areas. I think we finished the first half strongly, started the second half even better.\n\"And we were the better team until their first goal which was their first real threat on our goal. We defended the situation not as well as we would have liked and we should have stopped the goal. And it changed the game really.\n\"From our point of view, I think the first goal changed the game disproportionately to what we would have wanted. But I think we could have found a better reaction than what we did.\n\"But it looked like our confidence dropped in the game. Theirs certainly went up and they have very good substitutes who brought them confidence and they were the better team in the last 30 minutes.\"\nHurzeler: Brighton should get some confidence back\nBrighton manager Fabian Hurzeler:\n\"Overall we controlled the game, we defended quite well. Especially in the second half we managed to get more chances. We stayed in our structure and played more vertical in the second half and felt we deserved the win.\n\"The game always opens when you score a goal because the opponents have to react, defend higher, press higher and gives us more space in behind - we were able to use that.\n\"For me it's very important that we focus on and trust the process. We had better performances in the last eight games and we didn't win the games. Today, we played okay, we were solid but it was not the best performance from us.\n\"This win should give us self-confidence and the belief back.\"",

    "text": "En una iniciativa que ha conmovido a miles de usuarios en TikTok, Lucas, un joven cordobés, ha lanzado una emotiva búsqueda para encontrar a Macarena, la niña que fue su compañera en el jardín y con quien compartió un momento especial hace más de dos décadas. A través de su perfil en TikTok, Lucas compartió fotografías de ambos cuando eran pequeños, acompañadas de un conmovedor mensaje en el que expresaba su deseo de reunirse con ella. “Ayúdame a encontrar a Macarena. Ya que las redes son servicio, necesito de su ayuda”, escribió Lucas en su publicación. Recordando aquel momento de su infancia, Lucas relató cómo hace aproximadamente 25 años compartió su primer beso con Macarena en la guardería. Aunque el tiempo ha pasado y los recuerdos se desvanecen, el joven aún conserva en su memoria el afecto que sentía por aquella niña. Consciente de la limitada información de la que dispone, Lucas detalló que la guardería se encontraba en Córdoba Capital, aunque desconoce el barrio específico. Con determinación, expresó su anhelo de conocer el rumbo que ha tomado la vida de Macarena, si tiene familia, pareja o se encuentra soltera. El llamado de Lucas no tardó en propagarse por la plataforma de videos, alcanzando una gran repercusión con más de 55mil “Me gusta”, mil comentarios y cerca de 400 compartidos. La emotiva búsqueda despertó la solidaridad y la curiosidad de los internautas, quienes inundaron el post con mensajes de apoyo y la esperanza de que Macarena se presente. “Macarena, aparecé”, “¿Me avisan si aparece? Lloro de la emoción, me puse re sentimental”, “Cadena de etiquetar a todas las Macarenas”, fueron algunos de los comentarios que expresaron la emoción y el interés de la comunidad virtual por ayudar a Lucas a encontrar a su antiguo amor del jardín. Aunque tambien estan los comentarios que buscan quitarle la dulzura al posteo como el de Beto “seguro que a Maca el 14 le estaban dando como a cajón que no cierra y el muchacho buscándola”. Más allá del paso de comedia, Lucas necesita de tu ayuda para reencontrarse con la dueña de su primer beso.",

    "text": "Northern lights in Michigan: You may see them again tonight across the state Frank Witsil Detroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nAurora Borealis appears over northern US The aurora borealis appeared in parts of the northern U.S on Thursday. Footage shows the colorful northern lights visible from Lewes, Delaware. Michiganders — and sky watchers in other parts of North America — got a glimpse of the northern lights Thursday night, which space prediction scientists have said is more likely this year than others because the sun is at the peak of its activity cycle.\nIf you missed them, you could try again Friday night .\nOr just look at all the photos of the phenomenon, which are all over social media.\nThe aurora borealis or northern lights in, of course, the north, and aurora australis, or southern lights, in, well, the south, are a natural light display in the sky. Usually, they are visible closest to the poles, but sometimes, as they were Thursday, can be seen closer to the equator.\nSightings Thursday night were as far south as Kentucky.\nOne national news report, it turns out, focused on a 37-year-old New Yorker, Gabriela Aguilar, who told t he New York Times , that as a girl in Michigan, she went looking for the lights in the Upper Peninsula, but never found them until Thursday.\nIn New York, the heavens danced with colors — pinks, purples and greens — as Aguilar and her dog, Gomez, looked up.\nFor many, seeing the lights is on the bucket list.\nMore: Naked, 43-foot Trump sculpture goes up in Detroit, turning heads, sparking laughter\nLong before people understood the lights, they told stories to explain what occurred.\nIn Michigan, the Algonquin believed that the creator lit a celestial fire to let his people know that even though he was far away, he was still thinking of them. The aurora, that Native American culture said, was a reflection of that flame.\nAccording to modern science, the lights are caused by solar winds, what scientists would call disturbances in the Earth’s magnetosphere, and result in the heavenly show.\nIn recent years, the lights likely seem more visible, in part, because astronomers have gotten better at predicting them, and news publications like the Free Press, have been more diligent about reporting on them before — and after — they appear.\nOther technology has helped make them more visible, too.\nPhone cameras sometimes can capture the lights in photos and videos better than the human eye. Social media makes pictures of the lights accessible to everyone and everywhere and preserves them for what seems like forever.\nAnd on top of that, there’s also timing.\nScientists have found that about every 11 years, there’s more magnetic solar activity, which cases sunspots and the lights. It’s now the height of that cycle, what explanatory news site Vox, called a \" rambunctious year for space weather .\"\nIf the sky is cloudless on Friday, the optimal time to see the lights is within an hour or two of midnight.\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",
