    "title": "Zhuque-3 reusable rocket completes first large-scale vertical takeoff and landing flight test - Teller Report",
    "text": "China News Service, Beijing, January 19 (Reporter Ma Shuaisha) The reporter learned from Blue Arrow Aerospace that at 16:00 on January 19, the company's independently developed reusable vertical take-off and landing recovery verification rocket (hereinafter referred to as \"VTVL-1\") \"Test Arrow\") was ignited and launched into space at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China, verifying the key technology of the one-stage vertical return of the Zhuque-3 large liquid oxygen methane reusable rocket. The take-off weight of this test is about 50.3 tons, the flight time is about 60 seconds, the flight altitude is about 350 meters, the landing position accuracy is about 2.4 meters, and the landing speed is 0.75 meters per second. The rocket lands smoothly, the landing point is accurate, and the condition is good. The test mission has been achieved A complete success. The VTVL-1 test rocket is a single-stage liquid oxygen methane rocket with a body diameter of 3.35 meters and a length of 18.3 meters. The recovery leg has an unfolded diameter of 11.6 meters. It is equipped with an improved 80-ton liquid oxygen methane engine of the same type as the Suzaku-2 rocket. It has a maximum takeoff thrust of 80 tons, is capable of secondary ignition in the air, and is equipped with 3 sets of landing buffer legs. Different from the small-tonnage principle prototypes used by domestic private aerospace companies in the early years, the VTVL-1 test arrow is an engineering prototype built with a full-size engine. Its main engine is an improved version of the Tianque-12 engine that has been proven in flight. The thrust, performance and reliability have been further improved. In response to the needs of reusable rockets, it has added multiple starts in the air and depth variable thrust functions. In the future, this type of engine will be used in subsequent batches of Zhuque-2 rockets and Zhuque-3 launch vehicles. The main structure of the entire arrow is made of high-strength stainless steel, which is the same material system as the Zhuque-3 rocket. It is technically connected and has accumulated experience data in manufacturing, pre-launch filling, low-temperature heat transfer and reuse maintenance for the Zhuque-3 rocket, laying a solid foundation for Technical basis for first flight. In the future, the VTVL-1 test rocket will conduct a 10-kilometer flight test based on the successful experience of the first phase of the 100-meter flight test to further verify the key technologies of the reusable rocket's vertical return. The Zhuque-3 rocket is a reusable liquid oxygen methane launch vehicle with a body diameter of 4.5 meters, a fairing diameter of 5.2 meters, a total rocket length of 76.6 meters, a take-off mass of approximately 660 tons, and a take-off thrust of approximately 900 tons. The power system is adopted by Blue Arrow Aerospace The independently developed Tianque series liquid oxygen methane engine. The first stage of the Zhuque-3 rocket is designed to be reused no less than 20 times. The low-orbit carrying capacity for one-time missions can reach 21.3 tons, and the recovery mission in the air zone is 18.3 tons. It can support satellite Internet network launches and large communication satellites. Mission requirements for geosynchronous transfer orbit launches and various types of spacecraft launches.

    "title": "First-Hand Insights into Treating Hepatitis C in Pregnancy",
    "text": "Catherine Chappell, MD, MSc, presents what we know so far, highlighting the safety and effectiveness of direct-acting antivirals, the importance of shared decision-making, and the need for patient-provider discussions to ensure informed choices about care. At IDWeek, the session \"Should HCV Be Treated in Pregnant Persons?\" featured Catherine Chappell, MD, MSc, assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Chappell, an obstetrician-gynecologist with training in reproductive infectious disease, family planning, and addiction medicine, discussed ongoing studies on direct-acting antivirals for treating hepatitis C in pregnancy. The session aimed to equip participants with key learning objectives, including applying data regarding the safety and effectiveness of HCV antivirals in pregnant individuals, the role of shared decision-making in HCV treatment, and how HCV treatment can enhance self-efficacy and engagement in care for other health challenges. Chappell emphasized the current evidence supporting the treatment of HCV in pregnant persons, stating, “We have conducted two studies involving pregnant individuals with hepatitis C, evaluating the pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir during pregnancy. Our findings indicated that no dose adjustments are necessary, as the concentrations in pregnant individuals were comparable to those in non-pregnant individuals. Currently, we are also conducting a large prospective cohort study of sofosbuvir in pregnant people.” Chappell summarized her key takeaways: \"No dose adjustments are needed. We have the most robust data for the sofosbuvir-based regimen, but significant data gaps remain, particularly regarding the safety of the cabotegravir-prep regimen. There is also very limited data on the safety of breastfeeding, indicating that we still have areas to explore further.” Turning to the potential risks and benefits of treating HCV during pregnancy, Chappell highlighted, “The potential benefits of treating hepatitis C during pregnancy include achieving a maternal cure while the patient is engaged in care and has insurance coverage, allowing for treatment during antenatal care. Hepatitis C treatment has significant benefits, including preventing morbidity and mortality from liver complications, reducing community transmission, and providing psychological benefits for patients. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that treatment may mitigate risks associated with hepatitis C in pregnancy, such as cholestasis, preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction.” Chappell also addressed the risks associated with treatment, stating, “The risks associated with hepatitis C treatment in pregnancy depend on the gestational age at the time of exposure. Currently, there is no evidence suggesting increased risk to the mother or fetus based on the limited data available. Theoretically, treatment initiated after organogenesis, which is completed by 16 weeks, should not increase the risk of birth defects. However, there may be concerns regarding an increased risk of preterm birth or fetal growth restriction if treatment occurs later in pregnancy. Despite this, the available data does not indicate an increased risk.” When discussing practical applications, she advised, “When considering treatment, I recommend starting after the anatomy ultrasound is completed to ensure that there are no birth defects present that a patient might mistakenly attribute to the treatment. The 20-week ultrasound is critical in this regard. We have the most data on sofosbuvir-based regimens; however, insurance coverage may sometimes restrict the ability to prescribe these regimens. Therefore, it’s important to consider whatever treatment the insurance supports. Ideally, treatment should begin late in the second trimester or early in the third trimester, with the goal of completing the course before delivery. Finally, Chappell highlighted the patient perspective, stating, “In my experience, patients often want the opportunity to discuss treatment options during pregnancy and to have ownership over their decision-making. They can't make informed choices unless we present the options to them. Therefore, I encourage healthcare providers to talk to their pregnant patients with hepatitis C about potential treatment options during pregnancy.” Overall, no dose adjustments are necessary for direct-acting antivirals in pregnant individuals, with strong support for the sofosbuvir-based regimen. Benefits include maternal cure, prevention of liver complications, and reduced perinatal transmission, with minimal risks after 16 weeks gestation. Guidelines recommend starting treatment after the 20-week ultrasound through shared decision-making. Collaboration with high-risk OBs and perinatal addiction specialists is important, and patients want the option to discuss treatment during pregnancy.",

    "text": "Panaji: While a well-marked low pressure area over eastcentral Arabian Sea and north Karnataka lay off Maharashtra coast, the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Panaji, issued a yellow warning at 4pm on Saturday, as some parts of Goa received some quantum of rainfall.The associated cyclonic circulation with this system is likely to move northwestward and intensify into a depression over the central Arabian Sea on Sunday.During this post-monsoon month, nine days produced less than 10mm rainfall. But the wettest 24-hour spell during this month so far yielded 132.4mm—103.1mm on Oct 9 and 29.3mm on Oct 8. This created a high surplus of 63.1%, as the post-monsoon total swelled to 145.1mm while the normal value is 88.9mm at this stage.The spell on Oct 9 of 103.1mm was perhaps the second highest 24-hour spell in Oct after 108mm was recorded by IMD on Oct 25, 2019. This was due to super cyclone Kyarr, which came close to 150km to 200km to Goa’s coast five years ago.During the 24 hours till Saturday morning, IMD recorded a state average rainfall of 1.4mm, as compared to 0.9mm and 0.8mm on Thursday and Friday.Canacona recorded the highest rainfall of 3.4mm, Sanguem 2.9mm, Mapusa 2mm and other centres on a lesser scale. Figures of four centres were not available.The yellow alert issued by IMD will continue till Oct 14.",
