    "title": "Plusieurs incendies recensés à Grenoble, l’ultra-gauche libertaire suspectée",
    "text": "Dans la nuit du mercredi 12 au jeudi 13 juin, deux transformateurs électriques ont été incendiés à Grenoble. Le premier dans le quartier de La Tronche. Le second, plusieurs kilomètres plus loin, près du centre commercial Grand’Place, rapporte France Bleu Isère. Les pompiers sont rapidement intervenus pour maîtriser les flammes. Une enquête a été ouverte par le parquet de Grenoble et confiée à la police judiciaire. La piste d’incendies volontaires est privilégiée.\nLe procureur de la République de Grenoble, Éric Vaillant, s’est exprimé à ce sujet ce jeudi. Il a indiqué devant la presse que « la quasi-simultanéité des incendies des deux transformateurs […] fait en effet penser à des sabotages de l’ultra-gauche libertaire ». Pour l’heure, « aucune revendication n’est encore intervenue, mais il n’y en a pas toujours », a-t-il précisé.\n80 foyers privés d’électricité Le premier incendie a été recensé dans le quartier de La Tronche, vers 1 heure du matin. La dégradation de ce transformateur a privé 80 foyers d’électricité. Des groupes électrogènes temporaires ont été installés par Enedis dans la matinée, notamment pour alimenter le site des pompes funèbres situé à proximité.\nDeux heures plus tard, vers 3 heures du matin, un second incendie sur un transformateur haute-tension installé dans un ancien bâtiment EDF s’est déclaré. Ce poste haute-tension alimente 15 autres transformateurs sur le secteur et concerne entre 3 000 et 4 000 personnes. La Trésorerie Générale et le centre commercial Grand’Place se retrouvent également sans électricité. Des groupes électrogènes temporaires ont également été installés.",

    "text": "Protesters to state officials: Change clean energy siting rules in new Climate Action Plan\nPublished: 05-07-2025 5:10 PM\nModified: 05-07-2025 6:31 PM |\nHOLYOKE — Unperturbed by the rain that pelted their colorful signs, dozens of impassioned community members hailing from cities and towns across the region gathered in song and frustration to protest state clean energy siting practices they think will be more harmful to the environment than helpful.\nThey gathered Monday outside of the Visitor Center at Holyoke Heritage State Park, just before state officials held a public meeting to take input about new siting rules outlined in the state’s new Climate Action Plan.\nProtesters took turns announcing over a megaphone why they were braving the weather to make their voices heard. In these short speeches, a common theme emerged — they want a cleaner, greener future, but they don’t think sacrificing forested land to renewable energy projects will make that future come any sooner.\n“I’m here because I’m a stakeholder. I breathe air. How many people here breathe air?” Wendell resident Sally Stuffin asked her fellow protesters, garnering a round of whoops and cheers. “You’re a stakeholder. … Every blade of grass is a stakeholder.”\nAs the protesters sang, cheered and called for change, even more area residents filtered into the Visitor Center, shaking off umbrellas and ponchos as they waited for members of the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board to arrive.\nWhether they attended the rainy rally beforehand or opted immediately for the dry interior of the building, most of the meeting’s attendees were drawn to the park that evening because they wanted to provide input on the implementation of the state’s Climate Action Plan released last year.\nSome wanted forested land left unscathed in the path of clean energy development, while others wanted more local authority regarding project siting. But those who spoke tended to agree that so far, the state’s approach to reaching its clean energy goals has left them wanting — especially when reaching those goals means large energy projects popping up in their communities despite concerns within the municipalities.\n“This is a government takeover of our democracy,” Wendell resident Bill Stubblefield said into the megaphone before the meeting. “We need an energy policy for the future, for the people and for all living things.”\nLara Wahl, a Shutesbury resident who protested and spoke at the meeting, said what mobilized her and many others to come to the meeting was the way big energy projects are being pushed onto municipalities. And when those municipalities resist, she said, the energy companies sometimes pursue legal action.\n“The whole thing is that so many towns … are in current lawsuits with solar companies, renewable energy companies — and these are really progressive towns,” Wahl said. “Renewable energy should have been this really exciting thing, but it’s been so poorly mismanaged.”\nThis meeting was the last of four Climate Act Stakeholder Sessions, designed to inform the public on the implementation of new siting and permitting changes required by law, and to obtain community input on what might be missing from these changes. The Monday meeting tackled the topics of analyzing the cumulative impacts of energy projects, and laying out site suitability criteria for the project siting process.\nThe input gathered at these meetings and through written comments submitted by May 19 will inform future changes to the regulations, which will be presented at public hearings this fall. The Energy Facilities Siting Board aims to have new regulations solidified by March.\nThe Climate Act was signed into law by Gov. Maura Healey in November 2024, and changed the way energy infrastructure is sited and permitted in the state.\nMichael Judge, undersecretary of energy at the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, explained that to meet state energy goals, a “very large amount” of energy capacity building must be done over the next 25 years. Judge said that existing permitting processes for energy projects had hindered growth by being “lengthy” and “unpredictable,” necessitating changes.\nSome community members who spoke at the meeting argued that the new regulations put an emphasis on smoothing out the permitting process for energy companies, leaving local municipalities with little control over what gets built in their backyards.\nIn response, Rick Collins, director of clean energy siting and permitting at the state Department of Energy Resources, said that the 12-month siting timeline for energy projects is intended to be a way of “respecting both sides.” This timeframe, he said, provides a balance between projects getting rapidly pushed through versus being drawn out and leading to fatigue among locals who have to attend many meetings to address a given project.\nMaría Belén Power, undersecretary of environmental justice and equity at the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, explained that a primary goal of these stakeholder sessions is to foster “meaningful engagement and equitable distribution … of the benefits and the burdens” of energy infrastructure projects. This is why this particular session focused on setting forth the aspects of a site that would make it less suitable for development, like the potential public health risks it may pose, as well as creating a guide for cumulative impact analysis.\nCumulative impact analysis for energy projects will involve developing a baseline state for a proposed site based on four characteristics: the built environment, climate change, the natural environment and population characteristics. The goal of finding the baseline in these areas is for the Energy Facilities Siting Board to determine how a project will impact an area or community.\nBut unease about the new regulations continued to circulate throughout the meeting despite the assurances of gathered board members.\nChris Queen, a Wendell resident and member of the activist group No Assault & Batteries, called for the ability of municipalities to protect their citizens and environments in the face of energy development. Namely, he said that “solar facilities must be sited on previously developed land,” rather than on forested land where trees would have to be removed to make way.\nDan Ogden, a community member who attended the meeting online, said he found the language surrounding siting effects on public and environmental health to be “vague, inconclusive and subject to manipulation.”\n“Developers are given entirely too much leniency,” Ogden said.\nThe Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs’ Assistant Secretary of Environmental Justice Crystal Johnson, Energy Facilities Siting Board Director Andrew Greene and Belén Power declined to provide comment to the Daily Hampshire Gazette at the meeting.\nThe Energy Facilities Siting Board is accepting written comments on proposed regulations, and board members said that commentary sent before May 19 will receive the most consideration. Written comments can be sent to sitingboard.filing@mass.gov.\nAlexa Lewis can be reached at alewis@gazettenet.com.",

    "title": "Solar farm on agricultural land given green light",
    "text": "The solar farm is earmarked for 31.2 hectares (77 acres) of farmland south of Four Ashes, near Standeford A solar farm which is expected to generate enough energy to power almost 8,000 homes in its first year has been given the green light. The development, earmarked for 31.2 hectares (77 acres) of farmland south of Four Ashes, near Standeford, was approved by South Staffordshire Council&#039;s planning committee on Tuesday. Some residents were concerned that work would damage an access road to the site, and that they would have to foot the bill. But solar energy company Renewable Connections assured residents that it would carry out all repairs. Brewood and Coven Parish Council also objected to the proposal, highlighting the use of agricultural land in the Green Belt for the development. &quot;The agricultural use of the site will be retained for the duration of the project, and there will be no loss of agricultural land,&quot; said Jack Halstead, development manager at Renewable Connections. He added that the site would be retained in its current agricultural use for the duration of the proposal, and would enable existing sheep grazing to continue between and underneath panels.
