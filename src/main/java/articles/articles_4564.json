    "title": "Paulistão: Ramon se diz \"muito feliz\" no retorno ao Água Santa em 2025",
    "text": "Diadema, SP , 26 (AFI) – Em 2023, o Água Santa surpreendeu a todos e chegou entre os finalistas do Campeonato Paulista só sendo superado pelo Palmeiras na decisão. Um dos destaques daquela campanha foi o meia Ramon, que após o Paulistão foi negociado com o ABC e atuou em 30 das 38 rodadas da Série B.\nPelo grande ano que teve em 2023, Ramon teve as portas do futebol europeu abertas neste ano. No primeiro semestre, o meia defendeu as cores do Sheriff, da Moldávia, e na segunda parte do ano vestiu as cores do Keçiorengucu, da Turquia. Mesmo não tendo a sequência de jogos desejada, ele avaliou positivamente a experiência de atuar na Europa. “Fecho o ano de 2024 como um atleta mais completo. Sem dúvida as experiências que tive na Moldávia e Turquia agregaram muito para a minha carreira futebolística. São países bem diferentes, até em termos culturais, mas foram experiências válidas. Queria ter uma sequência maior de jogos, mas tudo que vivi foi incrível”, garantiu o atleta de 24 anos.\nDepois de rescindir o seu contrato com o Keçiorengucu, o meia Ramon acertou o retorno ao Água Santa visando o Campeonato Paulista de 2025. O meia já está em pré-temporada e projetou a expectativa de novamente vestir a camisa do clube de Diadema.",

    "title": "What does 12/31/23 mean? The last day of 2023 is an angel number",
    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests. If you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported. The once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website. The date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported. Here’s what we know about the date. Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated. FYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches. A palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. Numerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated. Here are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac : Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today 30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",

    "text": "celebritiesBackstreet Boys singer Nick Carter (43) was confronted with yet another tragedy in his family on December 23 when his sister Bobbie Jean suddenly died at the age of 41.\nPolice now confirm to various American media that she was found unconscious in her bathroom, just like her brother Aaron last year.\nLast Saturday, mother Jane Carter confirmed the sudden death of Bobbie Jean to\nentertainment site ‘TMZ’. She is said to have died of cardiac arrest, but that has not yet been confirmed. What the police have now revealed is that Bobbie Jean was found in her bathroom. She was then taken unconscious to hospital, where medics later pronounced her dead. Police have launched an investigation into the death, but authorities say there are no signs of foul play. It would now be investigated whether Carter had used drugs on the day of her death. According to ‘People’, the woman was imprisoned for cocaine possession from late September to early November. However, her roommates told police that Bobbie Lee had not used narcotics since her release. In addition, no drugs were found in Carter’s bedroom or bathroom, officers said.\nBobbie Jean, Nick, Leslie, Angel en Aaron Carter. © WireImage\nBobbie Jean’s death is the third loss for the Carter family in more than ten years. Last year, Nick’s brother Aaron Carter (34) drowned in his bath after overdosing on medication. Their sister Leslie died at the age of 25 after falling in the shower in 2012. She reportedly fell asleep under the influence of drugs after the fall and never woke up.

    "text": "Leeds PhD researcher wins coveted IMechE Tribology Bronze Medal An accomplished Leeds PhD researcher has received a prestigious prize in recognition of her early career success and commitment to tribology and engineering. Dr Sarah Crossland was given the Tribology Bronze Medal by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), which described her as a “highly accomplished and committed tribologist” who has spent her early career “seamlessly blending her background in engineering and physics with her clinical expertise to pioneer innovative approaches”. The Tribology Bronze Medal is considered the top award for early-career tribologists. As a prosthetist and orthotist, Dr Crossland started her PhD through the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Integrated Tribology at the University’s [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering), under the supervision of [Professor Peter Culmer](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering/staff/279/dr-peter-culmer) and Professor Claire Brockett. Here, she maintained her clinical practice as an Honorary Orthotist at Leeds Teaching Hospitals, allowing her to assess and prescribe orthotic devices and translate this experience into her tribology PhD. During her PhD, Dr Crossland developed novel ways to characterise strain in the skin on the plantar aspect of the foot as a surrogate measure for shear during gait. Through this, she worked towards a risk assessment tool that predicted regions of the foot that are risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers. Her work has already been translated into clinical application and has acted as a platform for several other research projects. As a culmination of her work at the University of Leeds in 2022, Dr Crossland received several awards including the STLE Platinum Poster Prize, a first-place podium award at the TriboUK annual conference, and was the runner-up in IMechE’s Best Bioengineering Project Video. Dr Crossland now serves as a lecturer in Medical Engineering at the University of Hull, where she continues her biotribology research and supports future engineers and scientists. While one Tribology Bronze Medal is awarded every year, 2023 proved to be a rare instance when two worthy recipients were given the honour; Dr Crossland was recognised alongside Kian Kun Yap of Imperial College London, a PhD researcher whose focus on in-situ tribometry has earned him numerous awards at international conferences.

    "text": "Co-founder and CEO of The Federalist Sean Davis joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to explain why he thinks the power brokers in the Democratic Party are having buyer’s remorse about Vice President Kamala Harris being their nominee.\n“I even joked at the time that Democrats are going to wish they had Joe Biden back. And I say joke. It’s kind of funny, ha, ha. I genuinely believe it. Because when you looked at the Teamsters poll that came out a month or so ago, the Teamsters, by and large, they kind of like Joe Biden. Blue collar Joe. He’s from Scranton. He had developed this kind of persona that they like. And then Harris gets airdropped in and they’re like, we’re out of here. And suddenly Trump has a 20 point lead. So, yeah, I think they absolutely wish that they hadn’t perpetrated just an awful attack on our sacred democracy by not letting their own people vote for who they wanted.”\nJimmy and Sean also share their thoughts on Harris’ rocky performance during a CNN town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper.
