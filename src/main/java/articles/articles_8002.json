    "title": "Turkey’s Erdogan welcomes Hamas accepting ceasefire, hopes Israel will do the same",
    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) – Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday he welcomed the decision by militant group Hamas to accept a ceasefire in Gaza, which he said was made in line with Ankara’s suggestion, adding he hopes Israel would do the same.\nTurkey has denounced Israel’s assault on Gaza, called for an immediate ceasefire, halted all trade with Israel, and announced its decision to join South Africa’s application for Israel to be tried for genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nSpeaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan called on Western countries to increase pressure on Israel’s leadership to accept the ceasefire. Ankara has repeatedly complained of what it calls the unconditional support given to Israel by the West, particularly the United States.\n“We welcome the statement by Hamas that they accepted the ceasefire with our suggestion. Now, Israel must take the same step,” he said.\nShortly after, Erdogan said on social media platform X that he had spoken by phone to Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh to discuss the militant group’s decision on the ceasefire and the ongoing efforts to end the fighting in Gaza.\n“During the call, in which I stated that I found it positive for Hamas to take such a decision with Turkey’s suggestion, we emphasised that Israel must take a step for a lasting ceasefire too,” Erdogan said on X.\nErdogan hosted Haniyeh and a delegation from Hamas, which he has called a “liberation movement”, in Istanbul last month.\n(Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu, Editing by Rosalba O’Brien)",

And you still just didn&apos;t know what to expect because we were cut off from the rest of the world immediately.

    "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, TX — The City of Corpus Christi and multiple homeless shelters are joining forces to ensure people experiencing homelessness will have somewhere to go beginning Sunday evening as frigid temperatures roll in. The Salvation Army is partnering with the Mother Teresa Day Shelter, Good Samaritan Shelter, and the City of Corpus Christi to open extra shelter spaces for people to get out of the cold. They will accommodate an additional 30 individuals on top of the 76 individuals currently at the Center of Hope at 1804 Buford. They will also provide sleeping bags, snacks, and coffee. On Sunday, January 14, The Salvation Army’s cold weather shelter will open at 7 p.m. at the Corps located at 1802 Buford. On Monday, January 15, and Tuesday, January 16, The Salvation Army will deliver 120 hot meals to Mother Teresa Day Shelter at 4 p.m., and they will extend their serving hours from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. They will also be opening their facility to accommodate 60 more people from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. \"The City of Corpus Christi will provide bus passes to individuals at Mother Teresa Day Shelter who are seeking shelter, to help them get to The Salvation Army shelter and The Good Samaritan,\" said Major Doria. The Corpus Christi Police Department will provide security assistance until midnight, then will conduct frequent patrols. The City will then arrange for CCRTA buses to pick up everyone from the shelter and transport them back to the Mother Teresa Day Shelter at 7 a.m., where they will then have the opportunity to stay there throughout the day. In addition, Corpus Christi Disposal/Skid O Kan is donating six porta-potties, while the City is also providing 60 blankets, a $500 HEB card, and an additional dumpster. “As temperatures drop, we recognize the critical need for our services, particularly for our most vulnerable neighbors facing real, life-threatening challenges,” said Major Doria. “Because The Salvation Army is embedded in the communities where it serves, teams are already on the ground and can respond immediately when a disaster strikes or weather suddenly turns. As the cold sets in, The Salvation Army will continue to keep hope alive and meet immediate and long-term community needs, not just during this winter, but year-round,\" Major Doria said.
