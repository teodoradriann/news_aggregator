    "title": "Massive Hailstorm Unleashes Baseball-Sized Hail in Sabinas, Coahuila, Shocks Residents",
    "text": "On March 16, 2024, residents of Sabinas in the state of Coahuila, Mexico, experienced an unprecedented natural phenomenon as a massive hailstorm swept through the region, unleashing hailstones comparable in size to baseballs. This severe weather event, captured and reported by local journalist Tania Flores, has drawn attention to the increasing intensity of weather patterns in the area, attributed to the collision of cold front number 40 and significant temperature differences. The hailstorm not only stunned the local community but also raised concerns about the preparedness for such unpredictable and destructive weather events.\nAdvertisment Unpacking the Phenomenon The hailstorm in Sabinas was not an isolated incident but a manifestation of the perfect storm conditions prevalent in the region. According to experts, the formation of such large hailstones is facilitated by a combination of factors, including the presence of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds, ample moisture, and significant temperature variations between the ground and the upper levels of the atmosphere. This event underscores the susceptibility of the Sabinas region to severe weather phenomena, challenging both residents and authorities to adapt to these increasingly common occurrences.\nImpact and Response Advertisment The aftermath of the hailstorm has been significant, with reports of property damage, including shattered windows and dented vehicles, highlighting the destructive potential of baseball-sized hailstones. Emergency services were quick to respond, assessing the damage and providing assistance to affected residents. The community has rallied together, showcasing resilience in the face of adversity. This event has also sparked a conversation about the need for improved infrastructure and early warning systems to mitigate the effects of future hailstorms and other severe weather events.\nLooking Ahead As the region recovers from the impact of the hailstorm, attention is turning to the broader implications of such extreme weather events. Scientists and meteorologists are closely examining the conditions that led to the formation of such large hailstones, aiming to improve predictive models and understand the potential link to climate change. The incident in Sabinas serves as a stark reminder of the power of nature and the importance of preparedness, adaptation, and resilience in the face of an ever-changing climate.",

    "title": "Auburn City Council votes no to liquor store at North Donahue Drive property",
    "text": "Auburn City Council voted no on a liquor store at the former location of Family Dollar on North Donahue Drive. In its Tuesday meeting, the council voted against the conditional use of a University Wine and Spirits package store on the property at 316 N. Donahue Drive. During the meeting, Auburn residents and property owners opposed the liquor store due to concerns about safety and respect for their property. Stephen Faulk, pastor at Auburn A.M.E Zion Church, said that the law does allow the city to restrict businesses that may sell liquor close to a church. Auburn A.M.E. Zion Church is located at 576 Martin Luther King Drive, and Faulk said if approved, it would be the third liquor store in their community. “We would like to ask that you would look at sharing opposition and voting against that liquor store,” he said. “I really wish, and the members of the community have also expressed, that something else could be done besides a liquor store...” People are also reading… Faulk said that they are concerned because people come to the church parking lot and drink often, and many of them are strangers. “I don’t want us to continue to have to have confrontations with these people,” he said. “And then there will be national attention brought on because of a confrontation with somebody drinking and throwing alcohol, containers, and bottles, disrespecting our church property.” Krishna Sanghani, who would’ve been the new owner of the University Wine and Spirits, thanked the church members for listening to him explain why he wanted to the store. “The concerns that I saw were mainly about safety; number two, the church; and number three, theft,” Sanghani said. “To this, I came up with a few things in my head, which I’d like to point out as an experienced business owner from the past few years, also running liquor stores within the Auburn city limits.” Sanghani said there are plenty of liquor stores on the railroad, and the Auburn police are doing a good job of making sure everyone is safe. “If people are stumbling and drinking and making their way across the railroad, you can easily say that the Auburn PD has failed, which I don’t believe so,” he said. “...When people steal at my current liquor stores, we work very well with Auburn PD as well as AI technology, to make sure that we actually catch those thieves and put them in jail.” Sanghani said that his business model is very different from the other two liquor stores in the area. “We are a wine and a fine spirits store, not just a liquor store,” he said. “... Things we have done, which I can argue that we have done for our communities, and we’ve supported local brands, such as Wild Leap, John Emerald Distilling Company – in order to get these products in Auburn, we require a liquor store that comes with a different business model.” Though the council has already voted against the liquor store, Sanghani hopes the council will reconsider. “When Family Dollar closed down, we saw this as an opportunity to kind of repurpose that, and we feel like we could do things right within the community,” he said. “...Selling stuff such as just sodas, candies, chips, bread, milk, frozen meals… and then we started reconsidering fresh groceries, fresh fruit, breakfast… That’s why we didn’t propose for an 8,000-square-foot liquor store because it’s not necessary. We felt like we could achieve that with half the building, and the other half we could have done the rest with groceries.” Other council business The Auburn City Council discussed a sidewalk from Old Mill Road to McKinley Avenue. After the discussion, they asked the city manager and her staff to come up with ideas related to some of the houses in the area that have had some issues with accidents. Mayor Ron Anders said they will let the community and public know when they will have answers. The city council approved a financial contribution to the Jay and Susie Gogue Performing Arts Center at Auburn University for its build-out project. The amount will be $5 million over 10 years or $500,000 a year. A contract with Auburn Game Day Law Enforcement Corporation and area public safety agencies was approved to provide supplemental public safety services for sporting events and/or special events at Auburn University from August 1, 2024, to July 31, 2025. The city council unanimously approved the exemption of certain “Back to School” sales tax holiday items from city sales taxes from Friday, July 19, to Sunday, July 21. The city council nominated Chris Hall, a worker in inspection services, as the employee of the month. The city council also gave service awards to Rick Willmon, who worked with public works for 15 years; Norman Pitts, who worked with environmental services for 30 years; and Phyllis Reese, who worked with the police department for 50 years. It was also announced that the Juneteenth parade will be on June 14 at 6 p.m., and a Juneteenth celebration at Kiesel Park will be on June 15.

    "title": "Este es el pecado que no tiene perdón de Dios",
    "text": "Tanto la soberbia, la avaricia, la lujuria, la ira, la gula, la envidia y la pereza son las siete pasiones del alma que la tradición eclesiástica ha fijado como pecados capitales. Tradicionalmente, se conoce que Dios perdona estos y otros pecados que la humanidad comete.Sin embargo, existe un pecado que no es perdonado por Jesucristo y es la blasfemia en contra del Espíritu Santo. De hecho, en la Biblia, en el apartado de San Mateo, 12,31, se detalla que los fariseos en su momento intentaron manchar las obras de Jesús diciendo que estas provenían del Príncipe de los demonios, por lo que en el apartado de este documento sagrado se dice: “Por tanto, os digo: Todo pecado y blasfemia será perdonado a los hombres, pero la blasfemia contra el Espíritu no les será perdonada”, (Mt 12, 24). ¿En qué consiste este pecado? De acuerdo con el portal web El Debate, el pecado al que alude Jesús es el de la blasfemia, que se trata de un endurecimiento radical del corazón que llega a tal punto de que una persona llega a desinteresarse por Dios de un modo consciente y voluntario.Asimismo, las personas que comenten este pecado caen en el convencimiento de que Dios no es grande en su misericordia al considerar que no perdona los pecados de los hombres. Esto quiere decir que el pecado es por el que se censura libre y de forma consciente la acción misericordiosa de Dios.“Según los Santos Padres, este pecado no se cometería casualmente, sino después de un hábito continuado en otros pecados que van deslizando al hombre hasta una postura de rechazo a la conversión a Dios. Por tanto, no es que este pecado no pueda ser perdonado por la misericordia de Dios, sino que el hombre no da pie a ese perdón” indica el portal en mención. Oración para pedirle perdón a Dios “ Padre, el peso de mis pecados pesa mucho en mi conciencia y sé que no hay justicia en mí. Vengo a ti suplicando tu gran misericordia, y me arrepiento de todos los muchos pecados que he cometido contra ti tan gravemente. Señor, confieso que en mi orgullo y arrogancia incluso bromeé sobre tu existencia y te blasfemé en palabras y hechos, sin embargo, descubrí que enviaste a tu único Hijo, el Señor Jesucristo, para ser el único sacrificio aceptable que podría pagar el precio por mis pecados. Señor, me arrodillo ante ti quebrantado de corazón por el mal que he hecho contra ti y suplico por tu gracia y misericordia sobre un pecador lamentable, que ha venido a confesar que Jesucristo es el Señor, y que Él es mi Salvador y Redentor. Lava todos mis pecados y limpia mi boca y mis pensamientos de la suciedad que se ha derramado en mi corazón ennegrecido. Señor, vengo con humildad de corazón y quebrantamiento de espíritu, y rezo y agradezco que en tu misericordia enviaste a Jesús a ser el precio por mis pecados. Gracias por tu promesa … que todos los que creen en Él no perecerán, sino que recibirán el perdón de sus pecados y recibirán el regalo gratuito de la vida eterna. Gracias por haber sido salvado por tu gracia, simplemente confiando en la sangre de Cristo, en cuyo nombre oro. Amén ”.",
