    "text": "Depois de inúmeras peripécias e atrasos, a Suécia tornou-se o 32.º Estado-membro da Aliança do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO, na sigla em inglês), aderindo formalmente à organização, depois de ultrapassados todos os obstáculos colocados pela Turquia e pela Hungria, aproveitando o processo para tratar de questões de política internas, no primeiro caso, e como um apoio nos constantes braços-de-ferro que mantém com a União Europeia, no segundo. Esta é uma consequência direta da invasão da Ucrânia pela Rússia, tendo a Suécia e a vizinha Finlândia pedido a adesão à NATO poucos meses depois do início da guerra, em maio de 2022, abandonando dois séculos de neutralidade. Uma das justificações do presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, para a invasão da Crimeia, território ucraniano, em 2014, foi a de que NATO se estava a aproximar perigosamente das fronteiras russas, o que Moscovo não poderia tolerar, mas quando a Finlândia aderiu à organização, no ano passado, a fronteira da Rússia com os países da Aliança Atlântica duplicou, e, agora, como referiu o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Letónia, Krisjanis Kariņs, de acordo, “o Mar Báltico torna-se um lago da NATO”. O secretário-geral da Aliança Atlântica, Jens Stoltenberg, regozijou-se e assinalou que se trata de um momento histórico. “A adesão da Suécia faz com que a NATO seja mais forte, a Suécia mais segura, assim como toda a aliança”, escreveu Stoltenberg na rede social X (antigo Twitter). Em comunicado, sublinhou também que a Suécia passou a estar protegida pelo “Artigo 5.º da NATO”, que estabelece que um ataque a um dos seus membros implica uma reação de todos os outros. “Estou ansioso para erguer a bandeira [da Suécia] no quartel-general [da NATO] na segunda-feira”, adiantou. A cerimónia terá lugar em Bruxelas, depois de todos os documentos da adesão terem sido verificados nos Estados Unidos da América (EUA). O presidente norte-americano, Joe Biden, já deu as boas-vindas ao mais recente aliado, e também outros governantes de estados que integram a aliança se manifestaram, como o ministro português dos Negócios Estrangeiros, João Gomes Cravinho, que, na rede social X, considerou tratar-se do início de uma “nova era de colaboração e segurança” na organização. No que se considera ser uma resposta à adesão sueca, a Rússia atacou Odessa, quando o presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, e o primeiro-ministro grego, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, visitavam o porto do sul da Ucrânia. Um míssil russo atingiu um edifício a 300 metros dos dois governantes, segundo Zelensky, causando mortos e feridos, mas Moscovo recusou que tivesse como objetivo atingir o presidente ucraniano ou o primeiro-ministro grego. A Grécia é membro da NATO, o que poderia gerar um conflito. Este processo de alargamento da NATO terá sido dos últimos conduzidos por Jens Stoltenberg, que deverá ser substituído na liderança da Aliança Atlântica pelo neerlandês Mark Rutte, atual primeiro-ministro demissinário dos Países Baixos, e tem sido apoiado por diversos Estados-membros – incluindo EUA, Reino Unido, Alemanha e França -, mas que conta ainda com a oposição da Hungria. O cargo de secretário-geral da NATO é reservado a um cidadão europeu e a sua escolha tem de ser aprovada por unanimidade dos Estados-membros da Aliança Atlântica.

    "text": "5 Things Heat Can Do for You and Your Projects There are a lot of ways to get things done when working on project cars, but few methods are as handy as leveraging heat to do work for you. Whether disassembling crusty things or creating new pieces by joining metal with the heat of an electric arc, the judicious use of heat can unlock new avenues and techniques of solving common problems faced by DIY enthusiasts everywhere. First off, let’s make something clear: We aren’t really talking about heat itself in most of these, we are talking about the powers of temperature differential. It’s that one part heated or cooled to a temperature different than the other parts creates advantages for the task at hand. For instance, it’s not the mere fact that the bolt is hot that helps you, it’s that the material of that bolt expands when heated. But we are getting ahead of ourselves: Here are five ways heat can help unlock your superpowers in the garage. To Diagnose There are a lot of moving parts in an automobile. Friction is the universal enemy of almost all of them. When friction starts winning the battle, it often shows in the form of heat buildup. This is also true for electrical connections and relays too. When something doesn’t feel right even though it all passes visual inspection, it is easy to start poking around and seeing what is warm. A prime example is diagnosing wheel bearings on trailers. Small infrared heat guns are a really handy tool now that the prices are nearing novelty purchase territory. Even just feeling things by hand can be telling sometimes, but using non-touch methods allows much more capability, as you would burn the heck out of your hand if you wanted to confirm if a particular cylinder was running right by checking header temp. There’s a tool for every job. To Break Corrosion Cars are built from a mulitude of different materials. In modern manufacturing, the usage of appropriate fasteners and hardware is figured out during the design process to ensure that they will not react adversely with others in the assembly. We often aren’t working on vehicles straight off the line though, and the facts of life tell us that everything corrodes, it’s just that some things resist it better. For rusted hardware, heat helps break the bonds between that surface corrosion and the base metal, allowing things to move freely again. To prove the point made earlier about temperature differential, those who have the ability to freeze hardware rapidly know that can be just as powerful as [an oxy-acetylene torch](https://www.hagerty.com/media/maintenance-and-tech/torch-er-test-5-ways-to-free-stuck-bolts/). The key to making it work is that the subject metals expand or contract with big swings in temperature. It works for breaking the bonds of corrosion but we can also leverage that fact… To Aid in Assembly The other day I needed to press eight bronze valve guides into two aluminum cylinder heads. The setup instructions for the parts called for .0015″ to .0025″ press fit, and with everything prepared and reamed to size, the guides were put in the freezer overnight and the heads were put in the toaster over at 200 degrees for 20 minutes. I used a special punch to align the guide and took light taps with a hammer to set them home. When the metals normalized to the 60-degree garage temps, everything was pressed and secured solidly. The exact physics of it are a bit murky to me yet, but luckily you or I don’t need to understand that to know exactly what to expect from heating things. Thermal expansion coefficients can be looked up in resource materials like Machinery’s Handbook, or the internet—whichever is more handy. To Add or Remove Hardness The materials we work with are fascinating when you get down to it. Even as at-home mechanics, we have the power to alter the properties and behaviors of steel or aluminum. This can be great for making tools, fabricating, or even reusing parts. Annealing a sheet of aluminum makes it [much easier to form](https://www.hagerty.com/media/people/prewar-prodigy-high-schooler-betty-lou-parrish-eyes-a-career-in-restoring-vintage-cars/), and also works for copper gaskets or washers to help make them a little more malleable and thus seal small imperfections better. The process involves heating to high temperatures then cooling either rapidly or slowly and controlled in a heat sink material like sand. To Weld Add enough heat to a part or material and it will likely liquify. Doing so in a very controlled method with the addition of a filler material gives the ability to create a strong bond between what was formerly two different parts. Welding is a garage superpower that comes with great responsibility—mainly that we be realistic about how good we are at it. A great weld is extremely solid and strong, but a mediocre or bad weld is downright dangerous in the wrong spot or place. Know the limits of your skills, machine, and materials in order to utilize welding in the most effective way possible. Heat is a superpower in the garage that we can use for all these things, and quite a few more. There are a multitude of methods to add or subtract heat which range from totally normal to unconventional, but they’re all effective. Regardless of what method you use, know that heat can be your best friend if you know how to use it. *** Check out the [Hagerty Media homepage](https://www.hagerty.com/media/) so you don’t miss a single story, or better yet, bookmark it.

Miguelito to distract the Carabineros and incidentally make it difficult for the police to get to the Brinks branch.\nDespite this, uniformed police arrived at the scene and a confrontation with the criminals ensued, resulting in seven members being arrested while fleeing, two of them wounded by bullets, one of whom is in serious condition at the Rancagua Hospital.\nIn addition to the detainees, a military rifle, five pistols and a smoke grenade were recovered.\nBrinks Robbery Government highlights action of Carabineros in robbery at Brinks After becoming aware of this fact, Minister of the Interior, Carolina Tohá, He stressed that “there was a very quick reaction from the police teams, particularly the territorial carabinieri and other services that are in the city, and they have been acting from the first moment.”\nThe Secretary of State noted that “ In their escape, this group followed a modus operandi similar to that used in other similar attacks, “in the sense that they throw firecrackers and burn vehicles to create distraction and obstruct the passage. In fact, the movement was detected by the smoke from the burned vehicles.”\nFor its part, Undersecretary Manuel Monsalve announced the filing of a complaint regarding this event, “It is a very serious incident that occurs in an urban area, there is burning of vehicles that interrupt the roads, there is use of firearms, some of them high caliber.”\nRegarding the wounded, Monsalve explained that “one of them has life-threatening injuries and is believed to be in the Rancagua Regional Hospital. And a second wounded criminal would have a ballistic impact in one leg and would be being transferred to the Regional Hospital.”",
