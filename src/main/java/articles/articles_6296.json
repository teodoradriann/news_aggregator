    "title": "Edify Energy hybrid power station to supply Rio Tinto aluminium smelter - pv magazine Australia",
    "text": "The proposed Edify Energy Smoky Creek and Guthrie’s Gap (SCGG) solar power station in central Queensland will supply 90% of its power and battery storage capacity to mining giant Rio Tinto’s Gladstone aluminium operations, following their signing of two hybrid services agreements (HSAs).\nRio Tinto’s 90% share of the SCGG battery system capacity amounts to 2,160 MWh, which will provide about 30% of the firming required to repower the Boyne smelter with renewable energy.\nLocated 580 kilometres northwest of Brisbane, the SCGG will be approximately 100 kilometres west of the Boyne Smelter and operational in 2028.\nEdify Energy Chief Executive John Cole said the SCGG Solar Power Stations will deliver the latest in solar, battery and inverter technology.\n“This collaboration is an important commitment to supporting the sustainable future of Australia’s industrial sector. We are proud to advance Rio Tinto’s goals to repower its Gladstone operations and to play a role in the transition to a low-carbon economy,” Cole said.\nIt’s the fourth power purchase agreement (PPA) signed by Rio Tinto for renewable energy to supply the Boyne aluminium smelter in Central Queensland, and includes a PPA with European Energy for its proposed 1.1 GW Upper Calliope solar farm.\nRio Tinto Chief Executive Australia Kellie Parker said these agreements are integral to repowering the Gladstone aluminium operations with affordable, reliable and lower carbon energy for decades to come.\n“For the first time, we have integrated crucial battery storage in our efforts to make the Boyne aluminium smelter globally cost-competitive, as traditional energy sources become more expensive,” Parker said.\nTogether, the four contracted projects are expected to supply 80% of Boyne Smelter’s annual average electricity demand, reducing the smelter’s scope 1 and 2 emissions by 70%, or 5.6 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, the equivalent of removing about 2 million internal combustion engine (ICE) cars from the road.\n“We continue to investigate further renewable energy investments to repower our Gladstone aluminium operations,” Parker said.\nSmoky Creek and Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations\nThe total SCGG station output is expected to generate over 1.5 million MWh of dispatchable renewable energy per annum and save over a million tonnes of CO2 emissions every year, generating the equivalent power used by 274,000 households.\nThe first stage will consist of a 600 MW connection, 720 MWp of solar panels and 600 MW / 2,400 MWh of lithium-ion batteries distributed throughout the solar array, using a DC-coupled architecture.\nTo be built on 1,800 hectares of land, the hybrid power station will link to Queensland’s state- owned transmission provider Powerlink’s 275 kV network via a new terminal station.\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

    "title": "Dolphins to lean on mindset while facing Chiefs in frigid weather",
    "text": "Jan. 12 (UPI) -- Tua Tagovailoa , Tyreek Hill and their teammates plan to lean on competitive mindsets when they take on the Kansas City Chiefs in frigid weathers Sunday in Kansas City, Mo., Miami Dolphins players and coaches said.\nThe Dolphins and Chiefs will kick off their wild-card round matchup at 8 p.m. EST Saturday at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. Advertisement\nThe National Weather Service issued a wind chill warning through Tuesday afternoon and said \"dangerously cold wind chills\" could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\nWhile the temperature at game time is expected to be somewhere between 2 degrees F and -8 degrees, the wind chill is expected to make it feel between -21 degrees and -28 degrees. Wind speeds will be between 14 and 20 mph, with gusts up to 30 mph. Advertisement\n\"Well, it's a mindset,\" Hill, who played for the Chiefs for six seasons, told reporters Thursday. \"I feel like if you believe it's going to be cold, then you're going to freeze your [expletive] off. But if you go into this game not even thinking any of that, you'll be fine.\n\"With me being me, I played there and I understand the conditions,\" the wide receiver added. \"I'm not even worried about it at all. I'm going to go out there with no sleeves and tell the rest of the guys it's a mindset.\"\nTagovailoa said he still is deciding what to wear to prepare for the frigid weather. He plans to \"see what it feels like without gloves.\" The Dolphins quarterback hasn't played in temperatures below 15 to 20 degrees.\n\"You can't prepare for a game like that, with that kind of weather, so it'll be new,\" Tagovailoa said.\nSaturday's daytime temperature is expected to reach a high of 5 degrees, while that could drop to a low of -8 Saturday night, according to the National Weather Service .\nThe NFL says that the 1967 NFL championship , played between the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay, Wis., was its coldest game on record. Advertisement\nTemperatures for that game, dubbed the \"Ice Bowl,\" reached -13 degrees, with a wind- chill of -48 degrees.\nThe league lists just one other game colder than the expected low Saturday in Kansas City. That matchup, dubbed the \"Freezer Bowl,\" featured the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego Chargers playing in -9 degrees in 1982 in Cincinnati.\nVeteran pass rusher Justin Houston , who signed with the Dolphins on Tuesday, said players will need to be most mindful of the cold when they are stationary.\n\"Just stay by the heaters during TV timeouts,\" Houston, who spent eight seasons with the Chiefs, told reporters. \"I think that's the worst situation. Because other then that, you're playing ball.\n\"You don't even think about the cold weather until a TV timeout when you're just standing there. I think that's the worst.\"\nThe Chiefs are 4.5-point favorites against the Dolphins. Sports books gave the game a 44-point total.\nThe Dolphins, who dealt with myriad injuries to key players over the last two months, could be slowed by the cold weather -- as well as the Chiefs' defense, which ranks No. 2 in fewest yards allowed.\nMiami not only lost to the Chiefs earlier this off-season, but also are on a 10-game losing streak in games with temperatures 40 degrees or colder. Advertisement\nPlayers cited the hard ground and crushing hits as deterrents for playing in the cold. The freezing temperatures also could take the air out of the ball -- literally -- limiting the distance on passes, field goals and punts.\nTraditionally, NFL teams lean on the running game when weather impacts downfield throws. That trend could favor the Dolphins, who own the No. 6 rushing attack in the NFL and lead the league with 5.1 yards per attempt. The Chiefs have the No. 19 rushing attack in the league.\n\"To be able to go and do athletic performance in that weather, it takes will,\" Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said. \"That will comes from a passion that is deep down that has been derived while a lot of these guys started playing the game that you're unlocking.\n\"The last time I played in zero-ish degree weather was 2021 at Green Bay in the divisional round. And much like this team, we were up in Santa Clara, Calif., and had like one coat in our closets. We weren't used to that at all. But it galvanizes people.\"\nFans also will feel the chill. The Chiefs advised game attendees Thursday to \"bundle up with loose fitting layers\" and to cover exposed skin. Guests are permitted to bring blankets and heated apparel. Warming trailers will be available in the parking lots, and an additional nine warming stations will be inside the stadium. Advertisement\nThe Dolphins practice this week in Miami Gardens, Fla., with a planned a walk-through Friday night in Missouri. Many players will likely use thermal wear, large jackets, gloves and other equipment Saturday, and heated benches and heaters will be provided on the sidelines.\nThe game will air on Peacock. The winner between the AFC's respective No. 6 and 3 seeds will advance to the divisional round.\n\"Hopefully, it warms up a little bit before the game, but if not, we'll be prepared to play in whatever they give us,\" Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones told reporters this week.\nThe 2024 NFL postseason will start at 4:30 p.m. Saturday, when the Cleveland Browns face the Houston Texans in another AFC wild-card matchup.\nThree games will be held Sunday as part of wild-card weekend. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will host the Philadelphia Eagles in the final wild-card game at 8 p.m. Monday in Tampa, Fla.\nThe 12 highest-paid players in the NFL Joe Burrow, $55 million Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow looks to pass against the Cleveland Browns in Cleveland on September 10, 2023. Burrow, who makes $55 million a year, signed a 5-year, $275 million contract extension last off-season. He sustained a season-ending wrist injury November 13, 2023, in a loss to the Baltimore Ravens.

    "text": "Reuters WRAPUP 1-Israeli tanks, missiles strike Gaza in offensive against Hamas Read full article Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud 29 December 2023 at 12:46 am · 4-min read\n*\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS:\n*\nEight Palestinians killed in Israeli airstrike on house in Khan Younis in southern Gaza\nBy Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n\"The task here is to dismantle Hamas - so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,\" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. \"We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.\"\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n\"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel's latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nStory continues SEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1% of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip's dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT'S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt \"to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,\" Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)\nTRENDING 1. 4 Singapore Stocks to Keep an Eye on in 2024 2. 6 things to note about CPF contributions in Singapore 3.
