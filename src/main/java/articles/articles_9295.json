    "text": "A New Rochelle resident and Mount Vernon resident both tested positive for the virus, making them the first confirmed human cases in the county this year, Westchester health officials announced on Thursday, Aug. 15.\nAccording to Westchester Health Commissioner Sherlita Amler, the confirmation came a little sooner than expected.\n\"These first cases of West Nile Virus are earlier than usual and should serve as a reminder to all of us to remove all standing water around your home every time after it rains,\" Amler said, adding, \"They are also a reminder to use repellents when you spend time outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.\"\nAlthough West Nile Virus usually causes a mild or moderate flu-like illness, it can still prove serious for those aged 65 and older. The virus can also pose a great risk to those with underlying medical conditions, officials said.\nTo help combat the virus and stop mosquitoes from breeding, any residents who notice large areas of standing water on public property should report them to the Health Department at 914-813-5000.\nResidents should also inspect their property for standing water and remove it.\n[Click here]\nto follow Daily Voice\nGreenburgh\nand receive free news updates.",

The sighting comes just days after the couple, who have been married for over six years and welcomed their son, Jack Blues Bieber, last summer, appeared to be in good spirits during a date night together over the weekend, presenting a united front despite the recent buzz.\nAlso Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's post-game conversation revealed after Chiefs secure Super Bowl spot\nJustin Bieber’s looks dishevelled in recent appearance\nThe Baby singer was spotted wearing his signature dishevelled-chic look, donning a bright yellow hoodie, baggy cargo pants, and fuzzy slipper-like shoes. As he walked through the bustling streets of New York City, Justin Bieber caught attention when he made a dramatic gesture, grabbing his crotch while strolling down the busy sidewalk, as reported by Daily Mail.\nHe completed his look with a black baseball cap as walked to his luxury SUV parked around teh corner. Meanwhile, Hailey was seen exiting a building in Union Square all alone.\nTheir appearances follow recent rumours of a tumultuous marriage as Bieber unfollowed his wife on Instagram only to clarify as he wrote, “Someone went on my account and unfollowed my wife.

Last week, an insider told the outlet, “Hailey's been struggling with Justin almost since the start of the marriage. She loves him madly but he's a loose cannon. Some of her friends have advised her to go it alone and leave him. His behaviour is sometimes unacceptable. She's put up with a lot.”\nThe source also added that Hailey and those close to her were hopeful that the birth of their baby would bring in some changes. The insider shared, “When the baby was born he was there for her and she thought being a father would change him for the better, but it hasn't stuck.”\nExplore now!.\nGet more updates from\nBollywood,\nTaylor Swift,\nHollywood,\nMusicand\nWeb Seriesalong with\nLatest Entertainment Newsat Hindustan Times.\nExplore now!.\nGet more updates from\nBollywood,\nTaylor Swift,\nHollywood,\nMusicand\nWeb Seriesalong with\nLatest Entertainment Newsat Hindustan Times.\n[News](https://www.hindustantimes.com)/\n[Entertainment](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment)/\n[Music](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/music)/ Justin Bieber's hollowed-eye appearance fuels marital issue rumours with Hailey Bieber",

    "text": "Listen below or on the go on\nApple Podcasts and Spotify\nBoeing (\nBA) workers reject contract, set to strike at midnight. (00:21) Fortinet confirms breach after hacker boasts of data theft: report. (01:51) FirstEnergy reaches $100M settlement with SEC in HB 6 bribery scandal. (03:00)\nThis is an abridged transcript of the podcast.\nBoeing (NYSE:\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews) workers overwhelmingly voted to reject a proposed labor contract which led to a vote to strike, with a work stoppage that began at midnight.\nApproximately 33,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) voted 96% in favor of the strike, far exceeding the two-thirds majority required to initiate a walkout.\n94.6% workers rejected the contract. The rejected contract included a 25% raise over four years and the union argued that these terms fell short of addressing the rising cost of living, as they sought raises closer to 40%.\nThis strike adds to the\nalready turbulent times at Boeing ( BA) after the emergency exit blowout, CEO step down, Senate hearings, and more.\nThe vote is a blow to CEO Kelly Ortberg, who urged the union members not to vote in favor of a strike as it would disrupt production and its struggling factory operations.\n\"Their tireless efforts have been on display throughout this entire process. Now, they will regroup and begin planning the next steps on securing an agreement that our membership can approve,\" the IAM said in a\nstatement.\nA CNBC report\ncited an analyst that said a 30-day strike could cost almost $1.5B to Boeing ( BA) and have an impact on supply chains.\nFortinet (NASDAQ:\nFTNT) confirmed a data breach after a hacker claimed to have gained access to files from the cybersecurity company's Microsoft ( MSFT) Sharepoint server.\nFortinet closed Thursday down 2.8%.\nAccording to a\nreport by BleepingComputer, the possible threat actor, who goes by the name \"Fortibitch,\" claimed on a hacking forum it had stolen 440GB of data from Fortinet's Azure Sharepoint.\nFortinet confirmed to Seeking Alpha, an\nunauthorized user did gain access to a limited number of files on a third-party drive.\n\"An individual gained unauthorized access to a limited number of files stored on Fortinet's instance of a third-party cloud-based shared file drive, which included limited data related to a small number of Fortinet customers, and we have communicated directly with customers as appropriate,\" a Fortinet spokesperson said. \"To-date there is no indication that this incident has resulted in malicious activity affecting any customers. Fortinet's operations, products, and services have not been impacted.\"\nThe threat actor allegedly attempted to extort Fortinet into paying a ransom, but the company refused to pay.\nFirstEnergy (NYSE:\nFE) has reached a settlement agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a $100M civil penalty to resolve the U.S. government's investigation into the House Bill 6 scandal.\nThe company's Q2 earnings materials indicated it had taken a $100M reserve in anticipation of an agreement with the SEC.\nFirstEnergy (\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FE) previously admitted to bribing former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and former Ohio Public Utilities Commission Chairman Sam Randazzo in a pay-to-play scandal; the pair helped the company secure a $1B bailout for two nuclear plants and other favorable treatment.\nAs part of a\n2021 settlement with federal prosecutors, FirstEnergy ( https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FE) paid a $230M fine; last month, the company reached an agreement to resolve proceedings with the Office of the Ohio Attorney General and the Office of the Summit County Prosecutor.\nMore articles on Seeking Alpha:\nChina to raise retirement age as workforce shrinks, aging population grows GS strategist says quality small-cap stocks worth a look as the Fed embarks on rate cuts Noom launches cheaper compounded version of Novo's semaglutide\nCatalyst watch:\nNotable events include keynote addresses at the Roblox (\nRBLX) Developers Conference.\nThe beginning of the five-day European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting will attract attention in the healthcare sector. Merck (\nMRK), AstraZeneca ( AZN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ( REGN), Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ), Incyte ( INCY), and 23andMe ( ME) are some of the notable companies due to present data or abstracts.\nKuaishou Technology (\nOTCPK:KUASF) will hold an Investor Day event during which it is expected to update on its AI initiatives.\nNow let’s take a look at the markets as of 6 am. Ahead of the opening bell today, Dow, S&P and Nasdaq futures are in the green. Crude oil is up 1.2% at $69/barrel. Bitcoin is up 0.1% at $58,000.\nIn the world markets, the FTSE 100 is up 0.1% and the DAX is up 0.5%.\nOn today’s economic calendar:\n08:30 AM Import and Export Prices\n10:00 AM Consumer Sentiment",
