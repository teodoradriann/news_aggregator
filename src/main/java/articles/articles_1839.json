    "text": "Free eye camps held in Leh-Ladakh & Spiti A team of doctors from the Mela Mal Sood Rotary Eye Hospital, Palampur, a unit of the Palampur Rotary Eye Foundation, conducted medical camps in the high-altitude areas of Leh-Ladakh and Spiti valley in a bid to provide free eye care to people. The Ophthalmology team of Rotary Hospital examined patients at Kaza, in association with Kaza Community Centre. Rotary Eye Hospital associate director Dr Rohit Kumar examined patients, and conducted 27 surgeries. The doctors of Mela Mal Sood Rotary Eye Hospital also organised half a dozen mega health camps across various regions of Ladakh, benefitting local communities with essential medical services. These health camps aimed to provide comprehensive healthcare services to the local communities of Ladakh. The ophthalmology team was led by director Dr Sudhir Salhotra and Dr Mukesh Kumar. Camps were also conducted in Khaltse, Saspol and Nimmoo of the Sham region. The team also conducted a two-day health camp in Diskit, Nubra Valley. In Leh, the capital city of Ladakh, a two-day health camp was held, where 2,000 eye patients were examined. The Ladakh administration expressed their appreciation and extended gratitude to the organisers and doctors for their dedicated efforts in organising health camps in remote areas of Ladakh. The administration also emphasised the importance of such initiatives in improving health care access and raising awareness about critical health issues among the local population. Talking to The Tribune, Dr Salhotra said, in the past one year, the Palampur Rotary Eye Foundation had organised around 20 medical camps across the state, 8,000 people had been examined and 500 successful eye surgeries had been performed.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) signed a tripartite Memorandum of Settlement pact with the Centre and Assam governments on Friday, committing to abandon violence and integrate into mainstream society. Signed in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah and Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the peace accord marks the conclusion of 12 years of unconditional negotiations between the ULFA faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa and the government. This significant peace pact is anticipated to bring an end to the long-standing insurgency in Assam. 106362098Making the announcement, Shah said, \\\"It is a matter of joy for me that today is a bright day for the future of Assam. For a long time, Assam, Northeast faced violence and after PM Modi became PM in 2014, efforts were made to reduce the gap between Delhi and Northeast.\\\"\\\"This is a new start of a period of peace for the whole Northeast, especially Assam. I want to assure ULFA representatives that the faith you have kept in Govt of India, from the side of Ministry of Home Affairs(MHA), a programme will be made in a time-bound manner to fulfill everything, without you asking for it. Under MHA, a committee will be formed, which will work with the Assam govt to fullfill this agreement,\\\" he added. \\\"As part of the memorandum of settlement signed by Ulfa with Centre & Assam govt, its cadres will give up arms & all forms of violence, disband the outfit, vacate their camps and join the democratic process.\\\"— AmitShah (@AmitShah) Notably, the hardline faction of the ULFA, led by Paresh Baruah and believed to be residing along the China-Myanmar border, did not participate in the agreement. Established in 1979 with the quest for a 'sovereign Assam,' the ULFA has been engaged in subversive activities, leading to its designation as a banned outfit by the central government in 1990. Assam CM said, \\\"Today is a historic day for Assam. During PM Modi's tenure, under the guidance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, work for Assam's peace was always underway. Three accords have been signed and with three accords tribal militancy has come to an end in Assam.\\\"— CMOfficeAssam (@CMOfficeAssam) The Rajkhowa faction, with a current strength of 553 leaders and cadres, had joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after signing an agreement for suspension of operations with the Centre and Assam government. Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah, however, declined to be part of the negotiations and broke away from the Rajkhowa-led faction in 2012.",
