The Longhorns are a massive underdog to win the NCAA Championship, at +100000 odds, per FanDuel.\nOur voters in this week's SB Nation Reacts survey agree with the oddsmakers, giving Texas/Xavier a 6% chance of reaching the Sweet Sixteen in the Midwest region of the bracket.\nThe winner of Texas/Xavier will play the No. 6 seed Illinois on Friday night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Rodney Terry led the Longhorns to an Elite Eight appearance in 2023 and reached the Round of 32 in 2024 as the head coach.",

    "title": "Silent Hill 2 Patch 1.06 Fails to Fix PS5 Pro Problems",
    "text": "Bloober Team has today released a new update for [Silent Hill 2](games/ps5/silent_hill_2) that intends to fix the issues the title is facing when it is played on PS5 Pro. It's available to download now and weighs in at 517.1 MB, but it appears that anyone playing on the new upgraded console shouldn't get their hopes up too much for the update to completely solve everything. The testing done by users after installing the update reveals there are still graphical issues with the build.\nFor example, Twitter user [@yrlak](https://x.com/yrlak/status/1859917296799821838) responded to the tweet announcing the update with a video of constant flickering and image blotches in an interior environment. Then, on Reddit, it's described how the opening area just outside of Silent Hill still features flickering in puddles and an \"annoying shimmer\" in reflective surfaces. \"The base PS5 still produces a more stable image,\" claimed user [erimiz687](https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gx4ii2/ps5_pro_patch_is_out/).\nIt's agreed this is a better version of Silent Hill 2 for PS5 Pro users with patch 1.06 applied, but the frame rate still appears temperamental and graphical glitches remain an issue. It looks like another PS5 Pro-specific update will be required to get the survival horror game in an optimal state. You can find the rest of the patch notes below.\nSilent Hill 2 PS5 Update 1.06 Patch Notes\nTechnology\n- Fixed a bug regarding trophy counting\n- Fixed some graphics glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro\nGameplay\n- Fixed door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map\n- Improved traversal spots and fixed an issue where enemies could get stuck\n- Fixed an audio glitch in the bull section of Toluca Prison\n- Fixed minor blocker in Labyrinth (player was unable to exit either side of the Labyrinth after obtaining the map)\n- Fixed map marker for boar lot in Toluca Prison\n- Fixed map marker west of Southvale\n- Fixed a bug with Maria's navigation\n- Fixed an issue where some of Maria's lines would occur multiple times.\n- Fixed an issue where the final boss was missing and a movement bug\n- Fixed an issue where mannequins would get stuck in ambush mode\n- Fixed interactions with items that were difficult to obtain\n- Improved boss animations\n- Added a guide for picking up the plate in the final puzzle of Toluca Prison\n- Fixed a translation issue when changing difficulty during gameplay\n- Fixed wall animation during Abstract Daddy fight based on user feedback\n- Fixed an issue where the game would not progress after a cutscene when using low FPS.\n- Fixed a progression-blocking issue at Brookhaven Hospital\n- Fixed some issues with lights in Southvale East at night.\n- Fixed an issue with the mannequin's physics\n- Fixed other minor issues with objects, collision detection, typos, lighting, drawing, and loading.\n[source [konami.com](https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106)]",

Jeudi 22 août, un ferry transportant des citernes de carburant a été visé dans un port russe situé en face de la Crimée annexée. Ce navire a finalement coulé.\nMalgré l’arrivée d’une centaine de secouristes et d’un train spécial de lutte contre les incendies, le ferry, ciblé par une attaque ukrainienne dans le port russe de Kavkaz a fini par couler, jeudi 22 août. Il contenait trente citernes de carburant.\n« Du fait des dommages subis, le ferry a coulé dans les eaux du port de Kavkaz. Il n'y a pas de foyer d'incendie dans le port », a indiqué sur Telegram le service opérationnel de la région russe de Krasnodar (sud-ouest), qui avait dénoncé plus tôt une attaque du « régime de Kiev » contre ce navire.\nL’équipage était, semble-t-il, à bord lors de cette attaque dans le port de Kavkaz, situé dans le détroit de Kertch, qui sépare la Russie de la Crimée annexée par Moscou en 2014. Deux membres d'équipage du ferry sont portés disparus et 17 autres ont pu être sauvés, a indiqué le gouverneur régional, Veniamine Kondratiev.\nViser des points stratégiques Après les attaques en 2022 et 2023 contre le pont reliant la Crimée au continent, Moscou avaient été obligé de trouver d'autres moyens pour ravitailler la Crimée. Ce ferry faisait partie de ces moyens de ravitaillement.\nLire la suite sur RFI",

    "title": "Harris celebrates $20 billion in climate action grants",
    "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris marked the award of billions of dollars in grants for projects addressing climate change in Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday, with the goal of boosting economic opportunity for people across the U.S. — particularly for those in communities that haven't always gotten a helping hand extended to them.\n\"While every community has the capacity to join the clean energy economy, not every community has had the opportunity to do that,\" Harris said.\nWhat You Need To Know The Biden administration on Thursday announced $20B in green banking grants for clean energy projects nationwide\nVice President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan visited Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday to roll out the program\nAlso Thursday, Harris officially opened a campaign office for the Biden-Harris reelection bid, highlighting the Democratic ticket's desire to flip the Tar Heel State in November's election \"I can tell you that I have seen first-hand, that in too many places, too many people with all that talent there have still had limited opportunity to access to capital, to do the work that they want to do to start and grow a clean energy buisness, to make their homes more enegy efficent, or to install solar panels or EV charegers in their community,\" she added.\nHarris, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, popped into Charlotte on Thursday to kick off $20 billion in grants awarded to green banks charged with financing \"tens of thousands of community-based climate projects,\" Harris said. That $20 billion investment, she added, \"will incentivieze more than $100 billion in private sector investing,\" creating \"good-paying union jobs\" and expanding opportunities for Americans.\nThe @VP and @EPAMichaelRegan met with a first time homeowner in Charlotte this afternoon.\nHe pays smaller energy bills because of a community partnership.\nHarris is announcing similar rewards nationally this afternoon in Charlotte. #ncpol @specnews1clt pic.twitter.com/GxLvLBYdau\n— Reuben Jones (@ReubenJones1) April 4, 2024 \"Imagine, for example, the young entrepreneur who wants to launch a startup to repair electric vehicle chargers, and that this person can now get a small business loan to hire her first employees. Imagine a small business owner, who can now take out a line of credit to buy a fleet of electric delivery vehicles, so he can stop paying for gas and reduce pollution at the same time. Imagine a house of worship that can now get a zero interest loan, so they can install solar panels to generate clean energy through electricity for the entire neighborhood,\" she added.\nShe noted that organizations like Self-Help Credit Union in Charlotte — an institution that includes a Credit Union serving four states in the South Atlantic region of the U.S., a federal credit union networked across the country, a nonprofit loan fund and national nonprofit focused on research and policy organization — have been working to help protect ownership and economic opportunity.\nSelf-Help, Harris said, has worked with residents and community organizations to help make homes more energy efficient, with better windows, new electric appliances and good insulation. Those improvements, one resident told her, have helped people like him cut hundreds of dollars off of their energy bills.\n\"That's more money in his pocket to be able to put aside some money to save for the kids, for their future, their education, whatever they need,\" Harris told Spectrum News in an interview in Charlotte on Thursday. \"We're combining what we need to do to be smarter around protecting our climate. And that means reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and it means being more efficient in how we generate energy. So we want to do that for the sake of our climate, for this beautiful earth that God gave us. And we want to bring down everyday costs for working families.\"\nDuring her speech Harris said that the grants will help 30,000 more families across America upgrade their homes to be more energy efficient.\nSelf-Help got a shoutout in Thursday’s proceedings for its part in the Climate United Fund, one of three selected grantees in the EPA’s National Clean Investment Fund, which will focus on financing clean technology projects. Self-Help is, along with Community Preservationg Coalition, a partner in the Climate United Fund, which won a $6.97 billion award. Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward were the two other grantees under the NCIF, awarded $5 billion and $2 billion, respectively.\nFive applicants were also selected to the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, created to establish hubs providing funding to community lenders in low-income and disadvantaged communities. The selectees for the CCIA are Opportunity Finace Network ($2.29 billion), Inclusiv ($1.87 billion), Justice Climate Fund ($940 million), Appalachian Community Capital ($500 million) and Native CDFI Network ($400 million).\n\"This investment demonstrates an important point,\" Harris said, as she concluded her speech. \"When we invest in climate, we create jobs, we lower costs, and we invest in families. When we expand access to capital and give every person in our nation no matter who they are or where they live the opportunity to pursue their dreams, we build a cleaner, healthier and more equitable and more prosperous future for everyone.\"\nAlso Thursday, Harris officially opened a campaign office for the Biden-Harris reelection bid, highlighting the Democratic ticket's desire to flip the Tar Heel State in November's election.\nThe @VP is at the Mecklenburg County Dem. HQ in Charlotte where she is opening 1 of 10 campaign field offices in NC.\nThe campaign is heavily trying to flip NC blue for the first time since 2008.\nBiden needs to drive voter turnout in Meck County for that to happen. #ncpol pic.twitter.com/DrK3mTGzR7\n— Reuben Jones (@ReubenJones1) April 4, 2024 North Carolina has not voted for a Democrat since going for Barack Obama in 2008. North Carolina has only gone blue twice in the last nearly 50 years. But motivated by a high-profile governor's race and the issue of abortion, Democrats see a possible opportunity for a pickup opportunity in a state that Trump only won by less than 75,000 votes, his narrowest margin of victory in the 2020 race.",

    "text": "羊城晚报记者 沈钊\n　　在广州天河的一栋写字楼里，屈博佳正对着电脑屏幕调试一段AI的参数。他的身份有些特殊——既是拥有10年经验的独立音乐人，也是AI音乐生成平台“天谱乐”的算法运营工程师。“我的价值就是用专业审美‘翻译’用户需求，将主观的音乐客观化，让AI模型理解音乐。”屈博佳说。\n　　这一职业的诞生，源于大湾区数字创意产业的爆发式增长。在大湾区政策与技术的双重驱动下，AI音乐从实验室走向商业化，而像屈博佳这样兼具艺术直觉与技术理解力的“跨界人才”，成为弥合创意与算法鸿沟的关键角色。\n　　如何让AI理解“江湖侠气”？\n　　跨界工程师解码AI音乐基因\n　　屈博佳一开始也没想到，玩音乐还能和大模型研发扯上关系。几年前，大模型风起，天谱乐团队开始自研音乐大模型时，算法工程师们面临着一个尴尬困境——他们能教会AI识别“4536251”的和弦走向，却无法让它理解“江湖侠气”该用怎样的音色呈现。这时，身兼独立音乐人与唱鸭App内容运营的屈博佳进入了团队的视野。\n　　“我的工作就是‘结合’。一定要给个定义的话，可以说是‘音乐指令工程师’。”谈及自身的日常工作，屈博佳表示，他需要反复验证音乐生成指令（Prompt）的有效性。“我会结合用户的各种需求去评测天谱乐大模型，根据模型给出的响应，并基于我对音乐的理解进行主观拆解，将最终的结果反馈给算法工程师。算法工程师再根据我的建议，对大模型进行进一步训练或者调参，让它更全面、更好用。”比如当用户输入“国风”“热血”等抽象需求时，屈博佳需要将其拆解为具体的音乐参数——从旋律走向、乐器配比到情绪节奏，再反馈给算法团队调整训练策略。\n　　而今，经过两年多的发展，已有4600万用户通过天谱乐官网及小程序、唱鸭App体验AI音乐创作，累计创作1200万首AI歌曲。凭借创新的技术和优质的产品体验，天谱乐大模型已为影视、文旅、媒体等行业客户提供AI音乐创作服务。此前，广州文旅上线的宣传片《广州欢迎您》当中的配乐，就是由天谱乐生成的。\n　　不过，AI在帮助大家实现作曲灵感的同时，也难免落入“套路化”的窠臼。在整个中国内地的音乐环境中，流行音乐是比较主流的，“但是我们也会发现，短视频平台上的流行歌曲可能存在一些相似之处，而我们的大模型生成曲目的时候，也会有类似的困扰。”屈博佳表示，为此，他会向算法工程师反馈，通过模型调参、数据投喂等方式去规避这种情况。\n　　AI音乐大模型为何会在大湾区发芽？\n　　政策红利转化为创新势能\n　　为何天谱乐这样的AI音乐大模型，会在大湾区生根发芽？记者梳理发现，近年来，广东数字创意产业发展蹄疾步稳。根据2020年发布的《广东省培育数字创意战略性新兴产业集群行动计划（2021-2025年）》预计，到2025年，数字创意产业营业收入突破6000亿元。但在2023年年底，广东数字创意产业集群营业收入已达到6233.38亿元，提前两年完成了目标。\n　　在实践过程中，广东数字创意产业发展散发出了长久“热力”。在刚刚过去的岭南数字创意大厦新基建高质量发展大会上，广东宣布将推出“五项举措”助力全省数字创意产业高质量发展，包括推出系列政策支持、支持培育产业生态集群、深挖岭南文化富矿等，释放出推动产业加速发展的强烈信号。\n　　政策红利直接转化为创新势能，天谱乐在大湾区这片文化科技沃土上茁壮成长。在影视娱乐产业，天谱乐已深度嵌入微短剧生产链条，其AI配乐系统可针对单集剧情自动生成多种情绪适配方案，大幅度缩短了配乐的周期；在消费创新方面，在刚刚过去的春节，天谱乐上线了一个小程序，让消费者可以生成喜庆曲风的歌曲用于拜年，也可以在歌词中藏入想要祝福对象的名字表达关心，得到了十分良好的用户反馈。\n　　面对AI音乐版权确权的行业难题，天谱乐则还与海外的版权公司合作，让商用用户使用大模型生成音乐得到版权认证，“商用用户拿到手的是一首音乐以及版权认证的标识，这样他们就可以放心地在各个平台使用这些音乐。”屈博佳说。\n　　大湾区的AI敢饮“头啖汤”\n　　计划让AI生成方言歌曲\n　　尽管国内AI音乐赛道已有多个玩家，但天谱乐凭借先发优势构建了自身的技术护城河。“比如人声合成的呼吸感，我们的大模型能还原歌手换气时的细微停顿。该模型还有服务于专业音乐人的旋律MIDI、和弦、调性等的控制能力，可以实现更精细可控的生成效果。”屈博佳表示，这是天谱乐目前的优势，也是未来会长期维护的重点。\n　　值得一提的是，在近期团队规划中，一项新任务被提上日程：让AI生成粤语、客家话等方言歌曲。“方言和普通话使用的文字是一样的，如何让大模型通过同样的文字输出不同的结果是个难题。”屈博佳介绍道，为此，团队正联合方言学家、本土音乐人构建专属数据库，希望让岭南文化通过AI走向世界。\n　　“AI不是对手，而是帮手。它能替比较流水线的音乐作曲，但人类对音乐的感知、对文化的理解永远无法被编码。”屈博佳表示，“未来，AI能帮人类写出更惊艳的旋律，而我们要做的，是让技术尊重文化，让创新不忘本源。”\n　　从大湾区生长出的天谱乐团队，既传承着岭南敢饮“头啖汤”的闯劲，也诠释着新兴职业与产业变革的共生逻辑。当屈博佳们在参数海洋中标注文化坐标时，他们构建的不仅是AI的审美认知体系，更是大湾区文化自信的数字化表达。",
