Sistema frontal: fuertes vientos dejan inutilizable una pasarela colgante en Purranque El intenso viento también ha provocado la voladura de techumbres y caída de árboles en la región de Los Lagos. Fuertes vientos dejan inutilizable una pasarela colgante en Purranque 01:27 Compartir El código iframe se ha copiado en el portapapeles La pasarela colgante del sector costero de Manquemapu, en la comuna de Purranque, provincia de Osorno, quedó inutilizable tras ser destruida por fuertes vientos que superaron los 100 kilómetros por hora. Las conexiones a los pilares de la estructura no resistieron las intensas ráfagas que se produjeron la tarde de este jueves. Habitantes del sector grabaron la destrucción de la pasarela y avisaron a las autoridades comunales. El alcalde de Purranque, César Crot, señaló que la pasarela ya estaba en mal estado antes del temporal de viento y lluvia, lo que contribuyó a que quedara inutilizable. Más información El sistema frontal que azotó la región dejó una víctima fatal tras el naufragio de una embarcación menor en el lago Rupanco. Además, miles de hogares permanecen sin energía eléctrica. Las emergencias por voladuras de techumbres, caída de árboles y anegamientos de calles sumaron cerca de 200 emergencias, las que han tenido que ser atendidas por personal de los municipios y bomberos de la región. Se espera que el sistema frontal dé paso a tormentas eléctricas durante la jornada de este viernes, lo que mantiene en alerta a las autoridades y a los habitantes de la región.

    "text": "Longshot J B Strikes Back (Goldencents) upset the inaugural running of the GII Laffit Pincay, Jr. Stakes (previously run as the San Antonio Stakes) Thursday in his first try facing stakes company for trainer Doug O'Neill.\nThe 3-year-old gelding, understandably one of the least experienced runners in the field and the second longest wagering price, broke his maiden in his third start in a $20,000 claimer at Del Mar and was claimed out of that start from these same connections who promptly bought him right back in a $25,000 conditioned claimer when he was sixth in his very next start. Off the board in his next two tries over both dirt and turf, J B Strikes Back jumped up to put up a big number in an optional claimer going one mile at Del Mar Nov. 3 and responded with yet another win facing similar company at the same distance Nov. 23.\nGuided from an inside draw with Antonio Fresu taking over from Juan Hernandez, J B Strikes Back was briefly outrun as the field passed the wire for the first time but quickly got himself into stride to contend for the lead outside of Ashcroft ( Munnings ) around the first turn and into the backstretch. Still two wide and joined by Tarantino (Pioneerof the Nile) to his outside nearing the half-mile pole, J B Strikes Back took advantage of Ashcroft fading along the rail to shoot ahead and turned for home with both Tarantino and Express Train ( Union Rags ) looming. But with a safe margin built up, the 16-1 chance turned the tables on the older horses and came home clear with only 20-1 shot American Admiral ( American Pharoah ) making up ground on him late and just missing for the placing.\n“It's such an honor to win this race,” said O'Neil. “My mom Dixie was really good friends with Laffit Pincay Jr.'s mom and we are really good friends with his brother Alonso, so the Pincay family really means a lot to us. He still looks like he can still ride today, it's amazing and a huge honor. Janie Buss and the whole Buss family they are so generous. She donates all of the earnings of any of her beautiful horses that make any money to different causes. This is really to her because she wanted to take a chance after his last couple of efforts. We took a chance, and it worked out perfect.”\nFresu added: “My trip was great, amazing it was what we had planned. What about this training performance by Doug (O'Neill)? This horse he kept improving and now he is in graded stakes, that was amazing. I feel very excited to see where he goes next. Today, what I was thinking was if the track was fast, to get a nice trip out in front, or be pretty close. I thought the horse had a good chance. He proved to us his ability.”\nPedigree Notes :\nJ B Strikes Back is now the second graded stakes winner under stakes-winning first dam Allanah, joining his talented older half-brother Reincarnate ( Good Magic ) who took the GIII Sham Stakes and also placed in the GI Arkansas Derby, the GI FanDuel Racing Pacific Classic Stakes and the GI Santa Anita Handicap. Allanah, who last went under the hammer for $105,000 at Keeneland November in 2018, is a half to MGSP Over Emphasize (Overanalyze) and this is the family of two-time Peruvian champion grass horse Zeide Isaac (Freud). J B Strikes Back, the eighth graded stakes winner for Goldencents, has an un-raced 2-year-old half-brother by Liam's Map and a weanling half-sister by Good Magic while Allanah went to Life Is Good for 2025.\nJ B STRIKES BACK ($34.80) struck back big in the $200,000 Laffit Pincay Jr. Stakes (G2) at @santaanitapark .

The 64-year-old lead singer revealed his condition to fans in a post on Facebook on Saturday. “For all of you asking, Tuesday I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer but before everyone gets all excited, it has a 99% survival rate, it has not spread,” Platt wrote. “It’s contained to my thyroid. I just have to have my thyroid removed. Go through some rehab time and be right back in the saddle.” Platt added: “I sincerely appreciate everyone’s positive thoughts and prayers. I have some absolutely amazing people going to bat for me!! as it has been put to me, this is just a bump in the road and will be behind me very soon! So everyone please CARRY ON!￼” Kansas was formed in 1973 and released its most recent album, The Absence of Presence , in July 2020.

    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: On Good Friday, church pews were packed with Christians observing the holy day.\nDean of the St Mary’s Anglican Cathedral here, the Very Reverend Dr Andrew Cheah, said that Good Friday was an important day for Christians nationwide.\n“Good Friday is really important for us, Christians, to remember that Jesus died for us.\nHe said services at the church had started on Maundy Thursday (March 28), followed by Good Friday, Easter Eve and Easter Sunday services.\n\"We are having extra services this year because we have to renovate the front part of the church,\" he said.\nHe noted that on Maundy Thursday, there were more members attending this year compared to last year due to the public holiday.\nIt is a busy Easter week for church staff and Cheah will only celebrate with his family after Easter.\nReverend Andy Ng said that the turnout for the Good Friday service was around 600 to 700, which was very encouraging.\n“I know many people took half-day leave to attend,” he said.\nDuring the 11am service, the congregation sang hymns as the pipe organ played in the background.\nAttendees read the Scripture together, knelt to confess their sins and listened to reflections shared by the pastors.\n\"The season of Lent invites us to contemplate and respond to this great act of salvation through prayer, reading of the Bible, fasting and acts of charity,” said the Right Rev Dr Steven Abarrow in the first reflection session.\nAfter the Good Friday service, the quiet church burst to life as members chatted with one another.\nHot cross buns were distributed and shared as a reminder of the faith.\nOpen Modal × Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!
