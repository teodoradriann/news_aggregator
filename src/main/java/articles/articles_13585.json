    "text": "Timothée Chalamet is one of the hottest actors in Hollywood at the moment. He’s earned the love of the public and critics, snagging major recognitions like an Academy Award nomination. As of this week, he can also add singer to his impressive and ever-expanding resume.\nThe actor—and now musician—scores his first hit single on the U.K. songs chart this week. Chalamet debuts at No. 78 on the ranking of the most-consumed tracks in the nation with “You’ve Never Had Chocolate Like This.”\nThe track comes from the soundtrack to the new movie Wonka . Chalamet stars in the film, which tells the origin story of the famous chocolate maker Willy Wonka, from the aptly-titled Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory . He’s the third actor to portray the entrepreneur on screen, following Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp.\n“You’ve Never Had Chocolate Like This” is one of dozens of tunes that either debut or return to the U.K. songs chart this week. The ranking is nearly completely refreshed, as now all the Christmas hits are gone, since the holiday has passed once again. In the past few frames, the tally was dominated by those jolly cuts, but now they’ve fallen away for another year.\nChalamet scores one of a handful of debuts on the U.K. songs chart this week. He is joined by fellow musicians Flo Milli (“Never Lose Me,” No. 61) and Travis Scott (“My Eyes,” No. 71). More than 50 popular cuts also find their way back to the ranking, now that it’s not as competitive, with stars such as The Weeknd, Olivia Rodrigo, Doja Cat, and Nicki Minaj appearing high on the list with comeback cuts.\nMORE FOR YOU 132 Billion In Student Loan Forgiveness Approved Who Qualifies And What s Next New Epstein Documents Unsealed: Bill Clinton ‘Threatened’ Vanity Fair Over Sex Trafficking Coverage, Email Alleges Samsung Teases Innovative New Galaxy S24 Ultra Capabilities Wonka opened worldwide in early December, just in time for families to head to the cinema around the holiday.

    "text": "La portavoz de Sumar en materia de feminismo, igualdad y derechos y libertades LGTBI, Elizabeth Duval, ha tildado de \"vergonzoso\" el nombramiento de Isabel García al frente del Instituto de las Mujeres. \"Este nombramiento del Ministerio de Igualdad es vergonzoso y envía un mensaje lamentable. El Instituto de las Mujeres no puede estar dirigido por alguien que sostiene la conspiración del borrado de las mujeres y critica la dictadura queer\", ha indicado en redes sociales Duval, que forma parte de la dirección provisional de Sumar hasta la celebración de su asamblea. La Federación Plataforma Trans y Euforia Familias Trans-Aliadas han pedido este jueves a la ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, que \"revoque\" la designación de la nueva directora del Instituto de las Mujeres y que, en su lugar, \"ponga al frente a una mujer que defienda a todas las mujeres, también las trans\". En este sentido, los colectivos han denunciado que García \"ha mantenido discursos abiertamente transfóbicos y antiderechos trans, durante la tramitación de la Ley Trans\" y han indicado que \"los recortes de derechos trans llevados a cabo por Ayuso, con la derogación de aspectos fundamentales de las leyes trans y LGTBI de la Comunidad de Madrid y los argumentos esgrimidos para ello, están en los mismos marcos ideológicos que defiende Isabel García\". También la portavoz de Más Madrid en la Asamblea de Madrid, Manuela Bergerot, ha cuestionado la designación de la nueva directora del Instituto de las Mujeres, una \"mala decisión\" que les preocupa. \"El Ministerio de Igualdad debe seguir profundizando en los derechos LGTBI y Trans. Más si cabe ahora, cuando gobiernos como el de Madrid los están recortando\", ha trasladado la sucesora de Mónica García a través de la red social 'X', antes conocida como Twitter. La senadora de Más Madrid y activista trans, Carla Antonelli, ha reprochado también la elección de Isabel García, que ha \"vejado\" al colectivo, al frente de este departamento adscrito en Igualdad, junto a la etiqueta '#AsíNo'. \"El Instituto de las Mujeres debe de ser para todas y cada una de las mujeres y esta mujer nos ha señalado a las mujeres trans, vejado e insultado: \"Dictadura queer\" / Lobby trans\" / \"Sigues lanzando odio igual que los queer\" / \"Puro delirio queer\" / \"La teoría queer tiene como objetivo perpetuar el patriarcado\", ha lamentado.

    "text": "(ANSA) – PARIS, MAY 02 – UNESCO has awarded the world prize for press freedom to all Palestinian journalists who cover the war in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting against Hamas for over six months. “In these times of darkness and desperation, we wish to share a strong message of solidarity and recognition to the Palestinian journalists who are covering this crisis in such dramatic circumstances,” said Mauricio Weibel, president of the international jury of media professionals. “As humanity, we owe a tremendous debt to their courage and commitment to freedom of expression,” Weibel said. Audrey Azoulay, director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said the award pays “homage to the courage of journalists facing difficult and dangerous circumstances.” According to the New York -based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 97 members of the press have been killed since the war broke out in October, 92 of whom were Palestinians.

    "text": "According to Colombian think tank Andrés Bello Foundation, there are more than 47 Confucius Institutes (CIs) in Latin America. These centers offer a window into Chinese language and culture, providing courses in Mandarin and traditional arts that have been welcomed by students and universities alike. Yet, beneath this veneer of cultural exchange lies a more strategic objective: the projection of China’s soft power and influence throughout the region.\nThese institutes, funded and overseen by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) Ministry of Education, are a key component of Beijing’s broader efforts to shape perceptions, foster political alignment, and expand its strategic footprint in the hemisphere.\nControversies\nDespite concerns surrounding these institutes, Honduras inaugurated its first CI in its capital, Tegucigalpa, in May 2025, following the establishment of diplomatic relations with China in 2023. This move comes against a backdrop of significant closures of CIs worldwide, due to concerns over academic freedom and undue Chinese influence. Australia and several European nations, including Sweden and the Netherlands, have seen universities shutter their CIs amid similar worries.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Honduras made the announcement via X, which included images of a ceremony held in Beijing, where an educational agreement was signed with representatives of the Francisco Morazán National Pedagogical University (UPNFM) and Zhejiang University of International Studies.\nThe agreement establishes that the new CI will operate within the facilities of the UPNFM, the institution responsible for teacher training in Honduras’ basic and secondary education system.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Honduras, the CI at the University of Panama, and other cultural and educational institutions, have been working together since 2023 to establish this institute in the country.\nAlarm bells ringing in the region\nThe expansion of Confucius Institutes has set off alarm bells in Latin America. Critics accuse the centers of promoting a sanitized version of China, omitting discussion of sensitive topics, including the Tiananmen Square massacre, the status of Taiwan and Tibet, and the detention of Uyghurs in so called “re-education camps.” The United Nations estimates that nearly one million people, largely Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, are held in these facilities, ostensibly for the purpose of combating terrorism.\nIn a report, Human Rights Watch described CIs as “extensions of the Chinese regime,” noting that they censor materials for political reasons and prioritize loyalty to the CCP when selecting their professors.\nThe Andrés Bello Foundation has warned that the presence of CIs in Latin America risk influencing local academic output, reducing criticism of China due to the financial dependence of host universities. In Colombia, an analysis of the operation of these institutions concluded that they are part of the CCP’s broader diplomatic strategy.\nLeaders with a Chinese vision\nAmid economic constraints facing many Latin America universities, accepting Chinese funding carries a risk to academic freedom. In the 2022-2024 Joint Action Plan between China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), Beijing pledged to increase the number of CIs in the region, promote Mandarin language education, integrate it into national curricula, and offer scholarships and study opportunities in China.\nThe Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences (FLACSO) highlighted China’s strengthened presence in Brazil through academic and scientific cooperation. Brazil currently hosts 12 CIs, some strategically located in economically disadvantaged regions that are of significant strategic interest to China.\nIn Peru, although the National University of Engineering does not host a Confucius Institute, it collaborates with the Shenzhen Polytechnic University on automotive research projects. According to experts, this type of academic collaboration could involve risks related to technology transfer, including military applications.\nIn an interview with Voice of America , Parsifal D’Sola, a Chinese foreign policy analyst and director of the Andrés Bello Foundation, expressed concern about the impact of CIs on academic freedom. According to D’Sola, the centers seek to train leaders who sympathize with China’s geopolitical vision.\n“As long as there is greater participation by Latin American professors in research funded by a Chinese government entity, we will see less criticism of China within academia, and that is something that benefits China’s international image,” D’Sola said.",
