    "text": "Payment processor Mastercard is favored by many investors, including Warren Buffett. Its stock went up nearly 23% in 2023, and it reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14% in the third quarter, with earnings soaring 28%. Advertisement Mastercard enjoys multiple moats protecting its business; these include its well-known brand and switching costs associated with moving to rival payment-processing networks. Another factor working in the company’s favor is its purposeful avoidance of lending. While becoming a lender would allow Mastercard to generate interest and fee income along with merchant fees, that would also expose the company to potential loan losses and credit delinquencies. Since it doesn’t lend, it can bounce back from downturns quicker than other financial institutions.\nAdvertisement Mastercard has cemented itself as the United States’ No. 2 credit card network by purchase volume (after Visa), and it should be able to keep its momentum going domestically over the long run. The shift from cash to digital payments will continue, and e-commerce will grow. Furthermore, Mastercard has a sizable opportunity abroad, as the middle classes in emerging markets expand. Over the coming decades, the company can also extend its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

    "text": "The \"Karma\" singer also said her bond with Chris Hughes on the show was \"not one\" of the reasons behind her breakup with Ebbs\nBy Rachel DeSantis Rachel DeSantis Rachel DeSantis is a senior writer on the music team at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2019, and her work has previously appeared in Entertainment Weekly and the New York Daily News. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 30, 2025 06:45PM EDT Comments JoJo Siwa on Nick Viall's The Viall Files podcast. Photo: Nick Viall/youtube\nJoJo Siwa opened up on The Viall Files about her breakup with Kath Ebbs Siwa said she was \"cussed out\" by her ex at the Celebrity Big Brother UK wrap party The star also said her breakup had nothing to do with Chris Hughes, with whom she formed a close bon on the show JoJo Siwa is opening up about her breakup with ex Kath Ebbs , just days after the Australian podcaster said they were “incredibly humiliated” by the relationship’s end.\nSiwa, 21, appeared on an episode of The Viall Files on Wednesday, April 30, and revealed the timeline of her split from Ebbs, 27, while reiterating the fact that her close bond with Chris Hughes on Celebrity Big Brother UK was not a factor, despite Ebbs hinting that it was in a TikTok video .\n“There’s so many reasons why my breakup happened. Christopher is not one of them,” Siwa said. “I actually told this to Kath, like, ‘Maybe it would be easier if he was!’ But he is not one of them, so if you’re going to share the story, share the story… Don’t paint it out to look like I cheated on you with him because I did not… I would not, and I have not.”\nThe “Karma” singer said she started having doubts as soon as she entered the Big Brother house earlier this month, as she saw a group photo of her and her family at Disney World and recalled being unhappy on the day the photo was taken.\nWho Is JoJo Siwa's Ex? All About Australian Podcast Host Kath Ebbs “It just opened a can of worms that… really did me in,” she said. “The second that I had a time to think… My brain just started to run with so many things that I have been OK with, that I have tolerated, that nobody should. It put a lot of things into perspective for me.”\nWhen she finally left the Big Brother house, Siwa was ready and excited to attend the show’s wrap party. Ebbs — who uses they/them pronouns — had allegedly told production they did not want to attend the party, but Siwa wanted to go regardless.\nThe Dance Moms alum said on The Viall Files that she warned Ebbs the party would end at a late hour, and because she needed time to decompress, suggested they have a deeper conversation the next day.\n“That upset them, rightfully so. They wanted to be with me. But I knew I wasn’t in a place for them,” Siwa said.\nAfter about an hour, Ebbs changed their mind about the party, Siwa said, and showed up.\nJojo Siwa and Kath Ebbs at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards on March 27, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. Christopher Polk/Variety via Getty\n“All of a sudden we’re at the wrap party for Big Brother . I’m getting cussed out,” Siwa recalled. “I understand where they’re angry and where they’re coming at me, but I also keep reiterating like, ‘I’m not in a place to talk.’... Anyway, by the 16th time somebody asks you, ‘Are you happy? Do you want to end things?’ You’re going to just spew your guts and I was honest and I said, ‘If you ask me tomorrow, I don’t know my answer. if you ask me right now, my answer is yes.’ And then that obviously was taken as yes, and it was a yes.”\nEbbs told their side of the story in a viral TikTok shared on April 26, during which they said they “flew across the world to support and be there and hold [Siwa] in whatever they would be experiencing, leaving such a wild experience, and instead, I was dumped at the afterparty, with Chris in the next room.”\nJoJo Siwa Says Relationship with Big Brother U.K. Costar Chris Hughes Is 'Platonic' as She Breaks Silence on Kath Ebbs Split Ebbs went on to accuse Siwa of “emotional cheating” with Hughes, as the two were seen cuddling, holding hands and sharing a forehead kiss over the course of the show.\n“In terms of Mr. Christopher, I don't know. I have opinions, [but] I'm not gonna say them now. In terms of their relationship, that's their journey, enjoy,” Ebbs said in their video.\nOn the podcast, Siwa said that Ebbs had asked her not to speak publicly about their breakup, but she wanted to present her side of the story in order to protect both herself and Love Island UK star Hughes, 32.\n“You don’t get to have it both ways,” she said. “But I understand wanting to share your truth, and that is the exact thing I told my ex. I said, ‘Look, if you would like to share what happened, if you would like to share how it happened, that’s totally fine. It’s your story. It’s your life. Please do not lead to the false narrative that’s already out there.’’\nClose Leave a Comment",

    "text": "Nach Statement: Schlagerstar enthüllt Klinikaufenthalt – „Psychosomatisches Problem“\nEs sind Enthüllungen mit Tiefgang: Schlagersänger Eric Philippi spricht erstmals über seine psychischen Probleme und seinen Aufenthalt in einer Klinik.\nKöln – Schlagerstar Eric Philippi (28) hat sich zu einem schwerwiegenden persönlichen Thema geäußert. Nach monatelangem Schweigen macht der Verlobte von Michelle (53) nun öffentlich, warum er sich aus der Öffentlichkeit zurückgezogen hatte. Seine ehrlichen Worte sollen anderen Betroffenen Mut machen und ein wichtiges gesellschaftliches Thema in den Fokus rücken.\nSchlagerstar öffnet sich: Eric Philippi lässt auf Worte Taten folgen\nWie unter anderem wa.de berichtet, hatte Eric Philippi kürzlich über Instagram angekündigt, über „Dinge, die sich immer hinter den Kulissen abgespielt haben“ sprechen zu wollen. Der 28-jährige Schlagerkünstler deutete damals an, dass es jahrelange Kämpfe gegeben habe, während nach außen hin alles perfekt erschien. Seine Fans fragten sich schon länger, warum Eric Philippi immer wieder von der Bildfläche verschwand.\nJetzt hat der Musiker gegenüber der Bild-Zeitung erstmals über seine mentalen Probleme gesprochen. „Ich habe seit langer Zeit ein psychosomatisches Problem, das sich vor allen Dingen durch Panikattacken äußert. Ich konnte nicht mehr am normalen Leben teilnehmen“, erklärte der „Schockverliebt“-Interpret. Anfang des Jahres hatte er sich für drei Monate in eine Privatklinik begeben.\nEric Philippi spricht offen über Panikattacken: Sie verhinderten seine Auftritte\nDie Erkrankung hatte massive Auswirkungen auf die Karriere des Schlagersängers. „Die letzten Auftritte vor meiner Therapie waren kaum noch zu bewältigen und ich konnte gar nicht mehr allein unterwegs sein“, berichtete er weiter. Die Panikattacken begannen mit schwitzigen Händen und einem Puls von 150, gefolgt von Atemnot und der ständigen Angst zu sterben. Diese Symptome machten es zeitweise unmöglich, weiterhin als Entertainer zu arbeiten. Immer wieder hatte der Saarländer Konzerte absagen müssen – teils recht spontan.\nWährend seines Klinikaufenthalts erhielt Eric Philippi Unterstützung von seiner Verlobten Michelle. Die 53-jährige Schlagersängerin besuchte ihn regelmäßig in der Klinik. Rückblickend bezeichnet Philippi die Entscheidung für die Therapie als „eine der besten Entscheidungen meines Lebens“ – ein Schritt, von dem er sich inzwischen wünscht, ihn früher gegangen zu sein. Heute geht es ihm nach eigenen Angaben „so gut wie noch nie“. Übrigens: Die Hochzeit von Michelle und ihrem Eric muss wohl noch ein wenig warten.

    "text": "A constitutional law expert says the coalition Government is using racist ideology to justify its roll back of Māori influence in local government.\nA select committee is hearing submissions on Simeon Brown’s amendment to the Local Government Act to again make council decisions to have Māori wards subject to binding referendums – and putting the issue on the ballot at next year’s local elections for those councils which do have Māori wards.\nDr Carwyn Jones from Victoria University of Wellington says councils which introduced Maori wards after 2021 report an increase in Māori participation and better discharge of their treaty obligations.\nThey also face considerable unbudgeted costs from the Government’s changes.\n “This is the case with a number of these matters which have come through the coalition agreements, there’s been no policy work to actually articulate or define what a problem is they really just based on ideology and based on a racist ideology,” Jones says.\nSeveral councils have spoken out against proposed changes to the Local Government ( Electoral Legislation and Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Bill .\nThe changes would require councils to hold a binding poll at the 2025 local elections if they had established Māori wards since 2020 and did not hold a poll.\nWaikato Regional Council, Waipā District Council and Taupō District Council are among the numerous local authorities around the country to have voiced opposition to the changes.\n Peter Verschaffelt, WaateaNews.Com",

Sarebbe questa la causa della morte di [Paola Bolognesi, l’ex pallavolista ](https://corrieredibologna.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/23_dicembre_27/ravenna-allenatrice-di-pallavolo-morta-alla-vigilia-di-natale-disposta-l-autopsia-708aff94-1b87-4a29-9597-27a58d19exlk.shtml)deceduta nella notte tra il 23 e il 24 dicembre scorsi nella sua casa di Bagnacavallo, nel Ravennate, stando al parere espresso dal medico legale subito dopo l’autopsia eseguita nel primo pomeriggio a Lugo. L’esame è stato disposto dal pm Raffaelle Belvederi della Procura di Ravenna che ha indagato a piede libero per omicidio volontario il marito della donna, il 54enne Miguel Soto di origine cubana. La morte di Paola Bolognesi e le indagini Il fascicolo non è ancora stato archiviato e occorreranno sessanta giorni perché il medico legale depositi i risultati dell’esame. «Siamo certi che l’indagine a carico del mio assistito – aveva commentato a caldo Franco Randi legale di Miguel Soto – sia un atto dovuto. Ha trovato lui il cadavere, la moglie aveva in mano un macchinario per la misurazione della pressione». Circostanza riscontrata dai carabinieri che indagano sul caso che avevano ispezionato la camera matrimoniale in cui la signora giaceva a letto senza vita. Sul corpo erano presenti lividi ed ecchimosi e tracce di sangue in bocca che avevano spinto gli inquirenti ad aprire un fascicolo e fare chiarezza. Per i testimoni la coppia attraversava una crisi coniugale Al momento del decesso, altra circostanza che aveva suscitato perplessità, Paola Bolognesi era vestita con gli stessi abiti con cui era rientrata a casa. Anche altre circostanze hanno imposto accertamenti. Stando al racconto di alcuni testimoni la coppia non stava attraversando un periodo sereno. Paola Bolognesi e il marito, che si erano conosciuti quindici anni fa, negli ultimi tempi litigavano di continuo e condividevano spazi diversi della casa. Tanto che il Miguel Soto aveva raccontato di aver rinvenuto il cadavere allarmato dal suono della sveglia che non smetteva di suonare nella stanza in cui dormiva la moglie. Il fascicolo rimane aperto anche se prevale l'ipotesi del malore Pare inoltre che la donna volesse convincere il marito ad andarsene di casa, da quell’abitazione del centro di Bagnacavallo in cui viveva anche il padre della sessantunenne, gravemente affetto da Alzheimer. Al momento, come detto, il fascicolo aperto in Procura rimane aperto anche se l’ipotesi del malore, comunque mai scartata alla luce di alcune patologie cardiache conclamate di cui la donna soffriva, ha preso il sopravvento sulle altre. Il funerale di Paola Bolognesi era stato programmato per il 27 dicembre, poi la decisione della Procura aveva imposto ai familiari di annullare la cerimonia che sarà celebrata nei prossimi giorni.
