Kenyan law enforcement fired teargas and live ammunition into the largely peaceful crowd, with unconfirmed reports of several dead on social media. Protesters called for members of Kenya's Parliament to reject the proposed legislation, which would increase taxes across the country's economy. Katie G. Nelson/SOPA Images via ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\nOops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nA court in Kenya on Thursday approved a decision to send in the army as police backup, as protests continue against a controversial tax bill that the government has promised to withdraw.\nWhile armoured military vehicles could be seen in the city, the court ruled in the evening that the deployment authorized by parliament was lawful in view of the outbreak of violence during the protests, which the police have not managed to bring under control.\nThe court rejected an appeal by a lawyers' association.\nOn Tuesday, hundreds of demonstrators stormed parliament and set part of the building on fire.\nHowever, Judge Lawrence Mugambi also warned of a \"dangerous trend\" that could lead to the militarization of the country. He also said deploying the military could intimidate the population.\n\"This can potentially muzzle the civilian population from protesting to what it believes are unfair taxation policies imposed by government and also put a wedge between [the] military and civilian population,\" he said.\nHe therefore demanded precise information from the government within two days about the scope and duration of the operation.\nThe atmosphere was tense in Nairobi on Thursday.\nDemonstrators were planning to march to State House, the official residence of President William Ruto , but were unable to do so as police cordoned off access roads. Police officers and military personnel were stationed throughout the city.\nThe streets around parliament were also blocked off.\nThe first demonstrators gathered at midday in the centre of Nairobi, where many shops were barricaded. Television footage showed the police using tear gas against the crowds and shots were heard.\nDemonstrations also reportedly took place in other Kenyan cities.\nIn the third-largest city Kisumu, in western Kenya, several hundred people marched to the presidential lodge, another of Ruto's official residences. There they gathered for a peaceful sit-in protest, the Nation newspaper reported.\nIn Mombasa, according to one demonstrator, violent criminals mingled with the protesters and attempted to loot shops. \"They have nothing to do with us,\" the protester told the KTN television station.\nViolent scenes have occurred in the past week as thousands joined the outcry against the taxation bill, which had been aimed at helping alleviate Kenya's deep public debt.\nProtesters say the measure would impose unaffordable tax rises on ordinary citizens and businesses already weighed down by the high cost of living.\nRuto on Wednesday said in Nairobi that he would not sign the bill into law after clashes resulted in a number of deaths.\nProtesters chant slogans during the demonstration.

Because of the rampant changes in lifestyle and agricultural practices, the desi cattle are being affected. So we create awareness by gathering more and more people by conducting morning walks like this. We are indeed surprised that 800 people turned up,” he said.\nPadmashree awardee Dr V R Gowrishankar, IIM Bangalore Prof Mahadevan and Dr S Ahalya, Vice Chancellor of Karnataka Sanskrit University, were among the attendees.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 07 January 2024, 21:45 IST)",

    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues. According to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.” “Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.” The 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman. People are also reading… Gregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He [died in 2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/27/entertainment/gregg-allman-obituary/index.html) at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications. The petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.” “Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states. “I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” [Cher told People magazine](https://people.com/cher-speaks-out-on-kidnapping-plot-allegations-about-son-not-true-exclusive-8350230) in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse. “I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.” Cher is also the mother of Chaz Bono. A hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation. CNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

Bundesliga .\nThe 23-year old Australian attacker netted the opening goal in just the third minute as Frankfurt took an early lead at the Fritz-Walter-Stadion but Kaiserslautern levelled in stunning fashion in the 23rd minute thanks to Florian Dick 's volley.\nMohamadou Idrissou had the home side ahead eight minutes before the break when he converted from the penalty spot before Andrew Wooten equalized for FSV a minute later.\nBut Kaiserslautern again rallied courtesy of Markus Karl as they went fourth on Germany's tier two table, three points within third-placed Paderborn , while FSV dropped to 15th, just three points above the bottom three.\nLeckie's goal was his ninth league tally of the season which takes his total to 11 in all competitions in 2013/14.\n For breaking stories and all the great banter like us on Facebook: facebook.com/tribalfootball Video of the day:\nTags Australia/Asia News About the author Andrew Slevison Follow",

    "text": "South Korea- /\nCommunications- /\n- KOSDAQ:A138080\nSome OE Solutions Co., Ltd. (KOSDAQ:138080) Shareholders Look For Exit As Shares Take 26% Pounding\nOE Solutions Co., Ltd. (KOSDAQ:138080) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 26% share price drop in the last month. Instead of being rewarded, shareholders who have already held through the last twelve months are now sitting on a 37% share price drop.\nAlthough its price has dipped substantially, you could still be forgiven for thinking OE Solutions is a stock not worth researching with a price-to-sales ratios (or \"P/S\") of 2.5x, considering almost half the companies in Korea's Communications industry have P/S ratios below 0.8x. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/S.\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n View our latest analysis for OE Solutions\nHow OE Solutions Has Been Performing\nAs an illustration, revenue has deteriorated at OE Solutions over the last year, which is not ideal at all. Perhaps the market believes the company can do enough to outperform the rest of the industry in the near future, which is keeping the P/S ratio high. If not, then existing shareholders may be quite nervous about the viability of the share price.\nWe don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out ourfree report on OE Solutions'earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/S?\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the industry for P/S ratios like OE Solutions' to be considered reasonable.\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 30% decrease to the company's top line. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk revenue by 68% in aggregate. Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\nWeighing that medium-term revenue trajectory against the broader industry's one-year forecast for expansion of 41% shows it's an unpleasant look.\nIn light of this, it's alarming that OE Solutions' P/S sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the recent poor growth rate and are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as a continuation of recent revenue trends is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.\nThe Key Takeaway\nDespite the recent share price weakness, OE Solutions' P/S remains higher than most other companies in the industry. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\nWe've established that OE Solutions currently trades on a much higher than expected P/S since its recent revenues have been in decline over the medium-term. When we see revenue heading backwards and underperforming the industry forecasts, we feel the possibility of the share price declining is very real, bringing the P/S back into the realm of reasonability. Unless the the circumstances surrounding the recent medium-term improve, it wouldn't be wrong to expect a a difficult period ahead for the company's shareholders.\nYou should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted 2 warning signs for OE Solutions you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.\nIf companies with solid past earnings growth is up your alley, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts\nOur new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities.\n• Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n• Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n• High growth Tech and AI Companies\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.\nExplore Now for Free\nHave feedback on this article?

    "text": "After rain postponed all but one Foothill League softball game last week, the league schedule is finally underway after Tuesday’s games.\nThe Saugus Centurions handed the Valencia Vikings a shutout loss, the first loss for the reigning undefeated league champions since an 8-6 loss to Hart in the final game of the 2023 regular season. It’s the first Saugus victory over Valencia since 2022.\nElsewhere on Tuesday, the Castaic Coyotes took down the Golden Valley Grizzlies at home while the West Ranch Wildcats beat the Canyon Cowboys at home in a one-run contest.\nThe Hart Hawks are the lone team to not play a league game so far.\nWest Ranch is set to visit Saugus on Thursday in a battle of two of the three unbeaten teams in the league. Castaic is slated to travel to Valencia on Thursday while Golden Valley is set to host Hart.\nHere’s what happened in Tuesday’s Foothill League softball action:\nSaugus 13, Valencia 0: The Centurions (9-2, 2-0) are off to a hot start in league play, shutting out Valencia at home on Tuesday, 13-0.\nThrough two league games, Saugus hasn’t allowed a run while putting up 25.\nJunior Taliya Mata allowed just two hits on Tuesday while striking out three and walking two.\nJunior Luci Curiel and senior Jordan Shepherd each had three hits for Saugus. Shepherd had two doubles, scored three runs and drove in one while Curiel scored once and drove in two runs.\nSenior Bri Coe hit two home runs for Saugus and had six RBIs while junior Amelia Johnson also hit a homer.\nSophomore Sydney Bolder and junior Blair Rune each had one hit for Valencia.\nCastaic 8, Golden Valley 2 : The Coyotes (7-4, 1-0) wasted no time in getting their first league win of the year, beating the visiting Golden Valley Grizzlies (2-4, 0-1) on Tuesday, 8-2.\nEmma French and Lulu Smith led Saugus with two RBIs each. Samantha Farrell had two hits, including a double and two runs scored, while Alexis Steen had two hits and two runs scored.\nKate Eppenbaugh struck out seven and allowed five hits and one earned run while walking five in a complete-game performance for Castaic.\nGolden Valley had four girls record a hit each. Izabella Pauley and Illana Watson each drove in one run while Isabella Diaz and Rohan Elhamamsy scored once each.\nWatson struck out seven and allowed three earned runs on five hits and six walks.\nWest Ranch 3, Canyon 2: The West Ranch Wildcats (4-5, 1-0) eked out a 3-2 comeback victory at home over the Canyon Cowboys (3-7, 0-2) on Tuesday to kick off their league campaign.\nAll three runs for the Wildcats came in the bottom of the sixth, which started with Canyon leading 1-0. Naomi Stoll scored on a wild pitch to tie things up before Ava Esparza doubled to bring home Elaine Shirley to give the Wildcats the lead. Esparza later came around to score on a bases-loaded walk.\nCanyon had opened the game with a run in the top of the first when Amber Phillips singled to drive in Vivian Rangel. A comeback of their own fell short for the Cowboys after Maci Dunagan singled in the top of the seventh to drive in Lanie Rafkin.\nJessica Carr struck out six over six innings for Canyon.",
