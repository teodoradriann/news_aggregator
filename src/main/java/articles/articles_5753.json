    "text": "Reports\nGround Report From Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh: How A Hindu Couple Who Was Tricked Into Islamic Conversion 20 Years Ago Recently Did 'Ghar Wapsi'\nSwati Goel Sharma\nMay 25, 2024, 01:54 PM | Updated 01:54 PM IST\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nTwo decades ago, when Shiv Prasad Lodhi and his wife Kavita sought help from their village pradhan to obtain government identity documents, their request led to a life-altering conversation.\nAccording to the couple, the pradhan, Mohammed Amil Sheikh, agreed to assist but suggested it was the right time to consider his long-standing suggestion – that the couple should adopt Islamic identities.\nShiv Prasad expressed reluctance, but Amil Sheikh insisted that was the only way he could help them. How else, he asked, could the couple survive in an all-Muslim village?\nShiv Prasad and Kavita found no counterargument and no viable alternatives.\nThree years prior, the couple had relocated from their native Varanasi to Amil’s all-Muslim village, Poore Adhari, in Hathgaon block of Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur district. They had come in search of employment, but without any identity documents.\nThe couple acquiesced to Sheikh's suggestion.\nSoon after, they received their respective Aadhaar cards, voter cards, and ration card. Shiv Prasad was listed as ‘Abdulla, son of Jabbar’. Shiv Prasad told this correspondent that Jabbar was an imaginary name provided by Amil Sheikh to the authorities; his father's name is Devnath.\nKavita’s name appeared as ‘Fatma, wife of Abdulla’ or daughter of Amil. In the ID card photos, she is seen wearing a burqa. She clarifies, “I have never bought a burqa in these twenty years. It was always the residents who gave me one to wear.”\nFour months ago, the couple publicly did a ‘ghar wapsi’ ritual.\nThey participated in a havan just outside their house, attended by scores of saffron-clad men from a local organisation named Ram Bal (Strength of Lord Ram).\nThe havan was conducted amid police security, signalling to the village that they were reverting to their original religious identities and embracing their former names.\n“We were tricked into conversion,\" Kavita told this correspondent. \"We would have liked Amil [Sheikh] to witness the ritual but he passed away a few years ago.\"\nAs per Kavita, Amil was likely over 70 years of age.\nAccording to Shiv Prasad and Kavita, they are natives of Dulahipur village in Chandauli block of Varanasi district. They married, in an alliance fixed by their families, about 25 years ago.\nTragic circumstances soon compelled them to sell their home and leave the village within two years of their wedding.\nShiv Prasad’s brother, his only sibling, succumbed to an illness. His parents had passed away when he was still a child, leaving him orphaned after his brother’s death. Kavita, who has no sibling, gave birth to a daughter, but the infant died on the sixth day.\nWith no clear direction, they sought the advice of a neighbour who worked in another district. Following his recommendation, the couple shifted to the area where the neighbour lived and worked.\nThanks to the neighbour, who was from the Muslim community, Shiv Prasad found work. The couple rented a place in the village.\nThey settled in well. In their new home, Kavita became pregnant again, and the couple hoped their days of misfortune were over. It seemed that the change in environment was finally bringing them luck.\nHowever, in the eighth month of her pregnancy, Kavita suffered a miscarriage. She was devastated. Neighbours began visiting her to offer condolences.\nThe women suggested that worshipping her Hindu gods was bringing her no fortune, and that she should instead pray at a local dargah.\nDesperate for hope, Kavita started following their advice.\nDuring this time, she also began working as a househelp at pradhan Amil’s house, where her lifestyle underwent significant changes.\nAt the behest of Amil’s family, she stopped wearing sari and adopted the salwar suit, the prevalent attire for women in the village. She also stopped wearing a bindi and sindoor, as discouraged by Amil’s family. She was told to live as the other women in the village did.\nWithin two years, the couple saved enough to buy a small plot just outside the village. The plot was owned by Amil Sheikh and the deal was finalised for Rs 40,000.\nIt was during this land transaction that Shiv Prasad realised the need for government documents to register the plot in his name. He requested Amil Sheikh for assistance.\n“He [Sheikh] told me that since I had no original documents in the name of Shiv Prasad, it was an opportune time for a name change to fully integrate,\" Shiv Prasad told this correspondent. \"I am illiterate. I attended the school until Class 2. I did as told.\"\nSoon after Shiv Prasad agreed, a ceremony was organised in the local mosque where the couple recited the Kalma, or the Islamic oath of allegiance. Shiv Prasad says Alim Sheikh told him it was a mere formality.\nA month later, the documents arrived.\nThe couple says their harassment began soon after and has persisted for two decades.\nFollowing their paper conversion, neighbours began demanding that they completely adopt Islamic ways. Shiv Prasad was often reprimanded for not attending mosques for namaz.\nKavita was discouraged from observing Navratri fasts and urged to keep roze instead, \"in line with village custom\". Public celebration or observation of their Hindu beliefs was no longer possible. They kept all practices indoors.\nPressure was also mounting on Shiv Prasad to undergo khatna, or circumcision.\nWhen he approached Amil Sheikh to register the deal, he was told he should first undergo khatna, as was customary. After several attempts, Shiv Prasad gave up on asking for the papers, fearing he would be pressured again.\nEven today, the house remains in Sheikh’s name, says Shiv Prasad, causing him constant anxiety. His attempts to get Sheikh’s sons transfer the property in his name have resulted in ugly spats.\nRefusing to undergo khatna also led to social ostracism, affecting his work opportunities. Shiv Prasad eventually started traveling to Mumbai for seasonal work, leaving Kavita alone.\nIn her husband's absence, Kavita began facing pressure from neighbours to adopt a baby from the village. They told her a woman should not be without a child.\nSensing this as a ploy to eventually take their house, Kavita refused, stating it was God’s will that she remained childless.\nOver the years, Kavita has grown accustomed to living in isolation. She has no friends or relatives and keeps to herself indoors.\nOn the day this correspondent visited, Kavita did not open the door for an hour despite repeated knocks. A neighbour, Anjum Begum, said ‘Fatma’ does not speak to anyone in the village.\nJust when this correspondent was about to leave the village without talking to her, Kavita opened the door. Expressing delight that someone had come to visit her from New Delhi, she said she had heard the knocks but deliberately did not open the door.\nShe later opened it only to see if it was her husband, as she had just realised that her phone was discharged.\nTowards the end of last year, Shiv Prasad and Kavita learned about an organisation named Ram Bal, whose members resided in a Hindu village about two kilometers away.\nThe couple visited them, seeking protection from ongoing harassment over circumcision and child adoption.\nThe activists approached the police and organised a public havan to send a clear message to the village: the couple was no longer Muslim.\nAgendra Sahu, 40, who heads the organisation, told this correspondent over the phone that it was Shiv Prasad’s desire to perform ‘ghar wapsi’ and the organisation merely facilitated it.\nBoth Shiv Prasad and Kavita are pleased with the public ceremony, which was attended by numerous policemen, giving them a sense of security. However, their documents still bear the names Abdulla and Fatma.\nThe organisation informed them that they must visit the district court to rectify this issue. The couple however says that all their attempts so far have been unsuccessful.\n“Lawyers have been ambiguous about what needs to be done. Some said it’s not possible since we don’t have any documents under our original names. Others are demanding exorbitant fee which we cannot afford,” says Shiv Prasad.\nHe added, “We will try again after the elections. Maybe everyone is busy right now.\"\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nSwati Goel Sharma is a senior editor at Swarajya.

    "text": "ENVIRONNEMENT - À quand du blanc sur le toit du Japon ? En 2023, le sommet du [mont Fuji](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/international/video/au-japon-la-bache-installee-pour-priver-les-touristes-de-photos-du-mont-fuji-est-desormais-criblee-de-trous_234614.html) avait vu [la neige](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/france/video/neige-de-premiers-flocons-en-france-les-vosges-battent-meme-un-record-de-precocite_239585.html) tomber le 5 octobre. On était alors dans la moyenne puisque le volcan culminant à 3776 mètres est généralement recouvert au début du mois d’octobre. Mais un an plus tard, toujours rien. [Le dernier rapport de l’ONU sur le réchauffement climatique enterre (presque) l’Accord de Paris, sauf si… ](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/environnement/article/le-dernier-rapport-de-l-onu-sur-le-rechauffement-climatique-enterre-presque-l-accord-de-paris-sauf-si_241337.html) Pour la première fois depuis que les relevés existent (les premiers datent de 1894, soit il y a 130 ans) il n’y a pas de neige au sommet du mont Fuji un 1er novembre. L’arrivée la plus tardive des flocons avait jusque-là été observée le 26 octobre, en 1955 et en 2016. « Les températures étaient élevées cet été », comme en septembre, « ce qui a fait obstacle à tout air froid » propice aux chutes de neige, a expliqué l’AFP Yutaka Katsuta, prévisionniste au service météorologique local de Kofu, dans le centre du Japon. Selon lui, [le changement climatique](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/environnement/article/en-isere-et-dans-les-alpes-de-haute-provence-deux-stations-de-ski-contraintes-de-fermer-leurs-portes_240559.html) est possiblement responsable pour partie de ce retard. Le Japon a connu en 2024 son été le plus caniculaire depuis les premiers relevés, égalant le record de 2023. Le mont Fuji est recouvert de neige pendant la majeure partie de l’année à l’exception de la période de juillet à septembre. Nombre de randonneurs choisissent alors de l’arpenter à la nuit tombée pour assister au lever du soleil depuis son sommet. Pas de neige sur le mont Fuji avant 6-7 jours Sur place, l’incrédulité est de mise. « C’est assez choquant de voir ça », témoigne un touriste français auprès de l’AFP. « Je suis en t-shirt et en short. Ça ne fait pas la même impression », glisse aussi Jason Le, un visiteur australien. Et selon les prévisions météo locales, il va falloir encore un peu de temps avant que le mont Fuji retrouve son aspect traditionnel à cette période de l’année. « Des précipitations temporaires sont probables près du mont Fuji le 6 novembre », a déclaré jeudi le site de prévisions météorologiques tenki.jp, géré par l’Association météorologique du Japon. « Avec une arrivée d’air froid, la pluie se transformera en neige près du sommet, selon ce site. Le temps s’éclaircira progressivement, et la première neige sur la montagne pourrait être observée le matin du 7 novembre. » Rendez-vous est pris jeudi prochain pour immortaliser les premiers flocons.

    "title": "Pide revisión de cinco exámenes de las PAU 2025 y no da crédito al resultado: \"¿Es legal?\"",
    "text": "Estas últimas semanas, uno de los temas más comentados en las redes sociales han sido las Pruebas de Acceso a la Universidad (PAU 2025). Y es que son muchos los estudiantes que estos días de junio han ido comentando tanto los exámenes como las notas obtenidas, haciendo 'trends' virales en TikTok que acumulan millones de visualizaciones.\nReaccionar a las notas de la selectividad se ha convertido ya en toda una tradición entre los más jóvenes, que no tienen ningún tipo de reparo en mostrar incluso sus malos resultados. La frase \"pide revisión\" se ha convertido estos días en un mantra que se repetía en casi cada vídeo viral.\nPues bien. Ya han comenzado a salir las notas precisamente de las segundas correcciones solicitadas por los estudiantes. Ahí es donde entra Imanol, un joven que se presentó a la selectividad en Aragón y que pidió revisión en un total de cinco asignaturas: Historia de España, Inglés, Matemáticas, Biología y Química. ¿El objetivo? Intentar sacar más nota para poder entrar en la carrera de Farmacia.\n\"Contexto. Me dieron las notas de las PAU hace ya unos trece días y no salieron bien, no me cuadraban. Reclamé cinco asignaturas y ahora vamos a ver las notas\", comienza explicando este joven, cuyo vídeo suma más de 600 mil reproducciones en TikTok.\n¿Y cuál es el resultado? Imanol consigue mejorar en cuatro de las cinco asignaturas, aunque sin mucha diferencia con respecto a los resultados previos. Sin embargo, la decepción es total con Inglés: en esta revisión, la nota es incluso más baja y hace media con la anterior, así que el resultado en esta asignatura termina siendo peor que el primero. \"¡Hijos de...!\", suelta Imanol, indignado, antes de proferir unos cuantos insultos más.\nA pesar de este susto en Inglés, Imanol consigue mejorar su nota final y, aunque no ha entrado en la carrera de Farmacia, sí ha podido acceder a los estudios de Biología, su plan B.\nComo era de esperar, el 'post' ha generado un aluvión de comentarios. \"Pero, ¿tras una reclamación es posible que te bajen la nota? ¿Es legal? No lo sabía\", \"cuando reclamas te hace media de la nota anterior y de la nota de corrección, es muy injusto\" o \"en Inglés jamás pidáis revisión\" son algunos de los comentarios que se pueden leer.",

    "title": "Hit Netflix Shows 'Bridgerton', 'One Piece', 'The Gentlemen' And 'Outer Banks' Amongst Series Not Returning Until 2026",
    "text": "According to\nDeadline, earlier today Netflix announced its lineup for its 2025 series which included the final seasons of popular shows Squid Game and Stranger Things and the returns of Wednesday, Ginny & Georgia, Monster, Emily In Paris and The Witcher. Although this is a great lineup of returning shows there are many anticipated popular series that will not be coming back until 2026.\nBelow is Netflix’s announcement titled “YOU’RE NOT READY | NEXT ON NETFLIX 2025.”\nPopular shows that were not announced to be returning this year include the fifth and final season of Outer Banks, Season 4 of\nBridgerton and The Lincoln Lawyer, Season 2 of One Piece, The Gentlemen, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Beef, Black Doves and 3 Body Problem as well as Season 7 of Virgin River. Although the listing isn’t set in stone and some series may move up and air later this year instead of the following.\nAs per\nDeadline, in the past, there have been scheduling changes with what Netflix announces would be originally airing during a certain year. For example, the third season of The Lincoln Lawyer and season six of Virgin River were originally not on Netflix’s 2024 list of shows premiering that year but were able to deliver new seasons for the October and December release. The Night Agent‘s second season was originally scheduled to air in 2024 and then was moved to early 2025.\nAccording to\nDeadline, fans of some of the series should not be shocked at the wait time for their favorite shows. Jess Brownell showrunner of Bridgerton announced that a two-year gap was expected between seasons of the series following the trend between the second and third seasons. Virgin River and Black Doves recently aired their current seasons on the streaming platform back in December so their not coming back in 2025 for a new installment is understandable. Many of the other series have either just begun production or just wrapped production on their next season.\nAll series and more are Available to stream on Netflix.",

    "text": "Kanye West has hailed Bianca Censori an \"amazing stepmom\" and an \"iconic muse\".\nThe 'Stronger' rapper - who has North, 10, Saint, eight, Chicago, five, and four-year-old Psalm with ex-wife Kim Kardashian - paid a heartfelt tribute to his spouse in recognition of her birthday and praised the Yeezy architectural designer for her constant support.\nHe shared a close-up photo of Bianca, who had her hair up in a bun, silver hoop earrings and minimal make-up and wrote on Instagram: \"Happy birthday to the most beautiful super bad iconic muse inspirational talented artist masters degree in architecture 140 IQ loving by my side everyday when half the world turned their backs on me and the most amazing step mom to our children I love you so much thank you for sharing your life with me (sic)\"\nKanye and Bianca tied the knot at a private ceremony in California in December 2022 - just a month after the rapper's divorce from Kim Kardashian was finalised - and it was previously believed to be a non-legally binding ceremony but it was later claimed they were determined to tie the knot for \"religious reasons\".\nAn insider previously told Us Weekly magazine: \"Kanye and Bianca were legally married last year when they had their private ceremony in Beverly Hills, it was real and legal ... [It was] because of religious reasons.\"\nThe source added the couple wanted to \"be intimate\" but they are \"also in love.\"\nIt was revealed the ceremony was legal and took place on December 20, 2022 with the pair using a confidential marriage licence which meant the marriage was not listed in the public record. The licence lists their wedding as having taken place in Palo Alto, California.\nA source told\nDailyMail.com: \"Ye has been a megastar for two decades and counting, and his first marriage was to someone who lives almost full time in front of a camera.\n\"Bianca and Ye have a totally different vibe. They are very private ... For that reason they've been extremely hush-hush about the specifics of their wedding day. I don't think anyone besides the pair of them know exactly how it went down.\n\"They are besotted with each other. I can assure you they are very much married.\"",
