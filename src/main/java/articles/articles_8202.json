    "text": "“Intentional\" friendships help end the cycle of poverty” More than ten percent of Virginians live below the poverty line. Circles is part of a national community-led support program, working to break the cycle of poverty. Participants (or “leaders”) are paired with volunteer mentors who serve as role models, offering support and friendship. The mentors hold participants accountable to their goals so they can break through barriers to financial success. TRANSCRIPT OF VIDEO WOMAN SPEAKS TO GROUP: Joy has given you all a Career Pathways Plan. If you haven't gotten it, you're going to get one, I promise. LISA SPECTER-DUNAWAY (BOARD CO-PRESIDENT, CIRCLES RVA): The plainest way I can describe it is that Circles works with people who are tired of living paycheck to paycheck and they are motivated to make change for themselves and their families. And they're leading that change, which is why we don't call them program participants, they are our leaders. They are matched with allies who are there to be their accountability partner, their coach. So the magic of Circles RVA really is that it's based on relationships. JOY THOMAS (BOARD VICE PRESIDENT, CIRCLES RVA): When I first started with Circles, I really didn't know that it was a poverty program, it was a big eye opener. Dealing with some of those barriers and things, and overcoming some of the barriers that was causing me not to have the money that I say I wanted to have. For me, it's the connection with their allies and building that community together and having somebody hold you accountable. WOMAN SPEAKS TO GROUP: I want you to think beyond, because the goal is to get you to the highest level, whatever that is for you. LISA SPECTER-DUNAWAY: For leaders and allies, they start with either an eight or a 12-week training program, and that's every Tuesday. And they look at their goals, the SMART goals, what has their progress been, what are the roadblocks, what is their budgeting looking like, and how can the allies support the leaders and how can they also celebrate the progress? HANNAH CONAWAY (LEADER): I was actually told about it through my therapist and she just recommended that it might be a good program to just help get us more financially on our feet, more stable. So my ally is Laura, I love her, she is becoming my best friend. LAURA BLACKWELL (ALLY): I think a lot of people who are in this program have a lot of trauma, even if I'm just giving her emotional support, that encourages her in ways that I never thought and I never thought I could help someone just by saying, 'Hey, I'm here for you.' I think a lot of people need that when they're trying to get out of any hard situation. LISA SPECTER-DUNAWAY: So every Tuesday we're here and we have dinner together. The second Tuesday of each month is something, a programming night, and so it could be job readiness, it could be practicing interviewing, it could be thinking about a different career path. What are the things that you're good at and passionate about that you may never have thought of that would be something that is attainable for you? HANNAH CONAWAY: One of the goals we've actually already achieved, so it was to get better housing and we just recently moved into a new apartment. It's definitely going to be a work in progress, but so far it is going really well. WOMAN 2 SPEAKS TO GROUP: I'm just grateful to be here. LISA SPECTER-DUNAWAY: Change is really hard for everybody and so when you have someone who is your partner walking along with you, then that helps reinforce the change, 'cause we're all people and we all need to have the number of relationships and we need to have family and we need to have enough resources so that we can thrive, not just survive.",

    "text": "So, is it the End? Possibly. Christians have been worried about the End since the days that Christ walked the earth. Could it happen three minutes after you have read this? Maybe. Could it happen three thousand years after you read this? Just as likely.\nToward the end of the twentieth century, closing two thousand years of history since the time of the Incarnate Christ (or close enough), millennium fever struck the Western world hard. A fist across the face and a punch to the stomach. Many fundamentalist Christians were calculating the time since Israel’s re-creation as a marker, while a number of Catholics were counting down the number of good, true, and legitimate popes remaining before a supposed anti-Pope arose. As such, the Virgin Mary had supposedly appeared in former Yugoslavia, dropping hints about popes and anti-popes and a variety of other fancies that many assumed were not fanciful. Radical doomsday cults (well, are there any other kind?) emerged out of the woodwork—or seeped into the aquifers in Yellowstone, depending on what kind of fuel and storage tanks they were using for the End—and evangelical authors had a field day (and a billion runs to the bank) predicting the End in fictional form.\nWould you be Left Behind? What kind of Tribulation would there be? And at what altitude? At the top of the stairwell? Eight stories up? Eight miles high? Would JC rule before the New Jerusalem arrived, or after? Would humans build the City of God here and now? How many seals would be broken by angels? Just who is that fourth horseman? And why are Catholics the only ones worried about that dragon devouring Mary?\nOf course, it is not all religious. Remember the fears regarding Y2K. Were you ready? Just how angular could all of this be?\nThe End is near!!!! The End is near!!!! Very near!\nSadly, such fever and fervor has yet to subside, really. We were just treated (subjected would be a more appropriate word) to a remake of the horrific, hate-filled Left Behind , this time with Hollywood superstar Nicholas Cage fronting. Why could the dear leader of North Korea not have gone after that one instead of the one from Sony? Sheesh, many might have even become convinced he is the anti-Christ. He would probably like that.\nWe worried about Harold Camping’s two dates for the end. Both were wrong. We worried about the Mayans ending their calendar. Nope. Even the Vikings seemed to have predicted the end right around now. Again, did not happen.\nIn fact, I can write with certainty that not a single prediction of the End has come true. Not one. Not even close.\nThough it is quite possible that many ends have come and gone, each a rehearsal for the End.\nChristian humanist scholars such as Eric Voegelin, Josef Pieper, and Thomas Molnar did much to prepare the world for the end of the twentieth century and what would amount to barely-contained lunacy regarding the End.\nThomas Molnar, reputed to be a rather unfriendly but equally brilliant man, tied the End to the beginning. If we are not focused on the End, we delude ourselves into believing we can build the Kingdom of God in the here and now. We look to the heavens, and we pull the most important things to this world:\n“From time to time the belief spreads among men that it is possible to construct an ideal society. Then the call is sounded for all to gather and build it—the city of God on earth. Despite its attractiveness, this is a delirious ideal stamped with the madness of logic. The truth is that society is always unfinished, always in motion, and its key problems can never be solved by social engineering. Yet, man must conquer, again and again, the freedom to see this truth. In the intervals he succumbs to the dream of a mankind frozen and final in its planetary pride.” [Molnar, 1967]\nMystic rhythms. Without the mysticism. Just lots of rhythm. But no method.\nOf those books at the end of the last century that took a look at what might happen during the End, the best fiction book is Michael O’Brien’s Father Elijah: An Apocalypse . It comes as a part of a series of six novels Mr. O’Brien authored, collectively called “Children of the Last Days.” Unlike the “Left Behind” series, which is essentially hate-filled tripe not worthy of even being pulp, “The Children of the Last Days” offers a beautiful examination of the most pressing of human questions: What is man? What is God? What is man’s relationship to man? What is man’s duty to God? Four of the books combine to form one story: Sophia House (2005); Father Elijah (1996); Eclipse of the Sun (1998); and Plague Journal (1999). The other two: Strangers and Sojourners (1997) and A Cry of Stone (2003), offer us glimpses into the struggle of grace and anti-grace in the time leading up to the End. In terms of literary style and contribution to North America letters, Sophia House is by far the best. Set primarily in a Polish bookstore during the Nazi Occupation of the early 1940s, the story revolves around a young Jewish genius and a confused Catholic intellectual and artist. The dialogue resembles a westernized version of Brothers Karamazov in spirit as well as literary excellence. The young boy grows up to be Father Elijah.\nWhy did Mr. O’Brien choose the genre of apocalyptic fiction, a field filled with the best science fiction as well as notoriously the worst, to write his story? “His [man’s] existence is inexpressibly beautiful—and dangerous,” Mr. O’Brien explains. “It is fraught with mysteries that beg to be deciphered. The Greek word apokalypsis means an uncovering, or revealing.” In other words, the End allows us to look at the most fundamental aspects of existence. “Through such revelations man gazes into the panorama of human history in search of the key to his identity.”\nOf everything I have read in the world of fiction and fantasy regarding the End, Mr. O’Brien makes the most sense. Not only is he worth reading, his ideas are worth pondering.\nAnd if you are looking for an excellent analysis of the whole movement from an intelligent perspective, turn to Carl Olson’s Will Catholics Be Left Behind?\nSo, is it the End? Possibly. Christians have been worried about the End since the days that Christ walked the earth. Could it happen three minutes after you have read this? Maybe. Could it happen three thousand years after you read this? Just as likely.\nAn article about the End cannot just end. It must End. So, I will conclude with the words of that mighty wielder of the pen, G.K. Chesterton. I will believe his words to be true long before I succumb to the Campings and their ilk.\nFor the White Horse knew England When there was none to know; He saw the first oar break or bend, He saw heaven fall and the world end, O God, how long ago.\nFor the end of the world was long ago, And all we dwell to-day As children of some second birth, Like a strange people left on earth After a judgment day.\nThis essay was first published here in January 2015.\nThe Imaginative Conservative applies the principle of appreciation to the discussion of culture and politics—we approach dialogue with magnanimity rather than with mere civility.

    "text": "CEO of the Year 2023 Finalist: Rich Benenson In 2022, under Rich Benenson's leadership, Brownstein Hyatt posted the highest revenue in the firm's history. Colorado is full of devoted entrepreneurs, business leaders and tech-savvy visionaries who are constantly taking the business world to new heights. It’s no secret that here, at ColoradoBiz, we love the Colorado business community. That’s why, every year, we spotlight the most impressive CEOs throughout our Centennial state and give credit where credit is due — to the forward-thinking minds constantly chasing the next great idea and upholding their business practices to the most purposeful ideals. We’re proud to introduce our finalists for CoBiz’s prestigious 2022 CEO of the Year award. Rich Benenson Managing Partner Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck Denver, Colorado Website: [www.bhfs.com](https://www.bhfs.com/) Under Rich Benenson’s leadership in 2022, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck saw an increase in revenue, growth in attorney and policy professional hiring, new comprehensive wellness and leadership development programs, and expansion of the firm’s DEI program. One of Benenson’s most notable challenges was moving the firm to Block 162, a new 30-story office tower in downtown Denver. The move was the culmination of three years of strategic planning that began in mid-2020. Benenson foresaw that Brownstein’s employees needed a fresh, hybrid office space, one that offered space for in-person collaboration, because a fully remote-working environment wasn’t a long-term solution for a firm that thrives on relationships in a team-oriented environment. Benenson joined Brownstein in 2002 as an associate in the litigation department and has had experience at almost every level of the firm and chaired almost every firm committee. This provides him with unique insight into the many perspectives of employees, allowing him to make informed decisions that serve everyone at Brownstein. In 2022, Brownstein posted the highest revenue in the firm’s history, and it was the No. 1 lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., for all of 2022 and the first two quarters of 2023. One of Benenson’s biggest challenges has been fully incorporating the thriving lobbying practice into a legal framework. As a lobbying practice headquartered outside of D.C. that only established a presence there 30 years ago, there is no other firm that is on the same trajectory to learn from. Benenson has successfully articulated a vision that aligns the firm’s legal and lobbying efforts to offer expanded services to clients. From strategic hires to expand Brownstein’s state government relations capabilities to encouraging a cross-selling mindset among all attorneys and policy advisors, there has never been more synergy between the law and lobbying practices. Attorneys and policy advisers are collaborating to better serve clients and provide innovative solutions. What started as an immense challenge when Benenson took on the role as managing partner has been harnessed into his greatest opportunity.",

Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic, UCR excused all retail tenants from paying rent. Regrettably, the establishment is in serious default with payments, and UCR has been compelled to file an unlawful detainer action. The deadline for the tenant to respond is April 30.\"\nThe Change.org petition, which was organized by Allyssa Richards, calls on the university to help the business survive.\n\"Save Getaway. Save a piece of Riverside. Save a piece of UCR history,\" Richards wrote.\nThe Getaway Cafe has long been a meaningful melting pot for students, faculty and staff on the Bannockburn Village mixed-housing part of the campus. It was beloved for its pitchers of beer and famous Blazing Chicken Pizza.\n\"We had to move far away in 2020, but we still make a trip out there at least once a year just so I can get that pizza,\" Katria, a signer on the Change.org petition, said.\nElizabeth, who signed the Change.org petition, wrote that the bar was a huge, important part of her PH.D experience from 2017 to 2023.\n\"Relationships were formed, scientific ideas were discussed, and pizzas were eaten,\" she wrote.\nMohanned wrote: \"30+ years in a community should count for something!

    "text": "En medio de una alta tensión política entre Argentina y Francia por razones deportivas, racistas y policiales, el presidente Javier Milei llegó a París a la hora del té de este jueves para participar mañana en la ceremonia de apertura de los Juegos Olímpicos. A ello le suma una reunión bilateral con el presidente francés Emmanuel Macron , en el día más ocupado de su mandato. El presidente es un invitado oficial del gobierno francés pero prefirió vivir en un hotel más modesto que un cinco estrellas. Así llegó al Le Metropolitan , un hotel boutique en la Place de Mexico, donde se alojó en una suite , con vista a la Torre Eiffel, en la zona roja en la que se ha dividido la ciudad por las olimpíadas. Mientras Milei arribó a la capital francesa, los equipos argentinos que comenzaron a participar en los Juegos Olímpicos fueron abucheados, silbados, incluido el Himno Nacional , como un repudio a un cantito racista entonada como celebración por parte de la selección nacional argentina cuando ganó la Copa América. El cantito se refería al origen africano y árabe de los ancestros de los jugadores del equipo francés de fútbol y la situación policial de dos rugbiers franceses, que están siendo investigados por un caso de violación en Mendoza. Un clima hostil, que no imaginaban y que seguramente será discutido entre Milei y Macron , en su reunión bilateral de este viernes. El presidente argentino llegó acompañado por Karina, su hermana y secretaria general de la Presidencia, quien estará junto a él en la ceremonia inaugural en el río Sena y el joven embajador argentino en Francia, Ian Sielecki. La invitación siempre fue para tres personas y nunca estuvo en duda la participación de los tres, a pesar de las diferentes versiones. Era para el presidente, un acompañante y el embajador en Francia. Karina fue la encargada de pedir disculpas al embajador de Francia en Buenos Aires, Romain Nadal, luego del Twitter de simpatía y el “te banco” de la vicepresidenta Victoria Villaruel con el jugador Enzo Fernández frente a la canción racista, para acusar después a Francia de “hipocresía”, unos días antes del viaje presidencial. Milei debió alquilar un avión privado Bombardier para hacer el viaje junto a su hermana porque su nave oficial, herencia de su antecesor Alberto Fernández, no ha recibido aún el service correspondiente para seguir volando. El secretario de Deportes Daniel Scioli, que también participa, llegó en otro avión. Su primer visita en el hotel, donde se alojó, fue la del embajador argentino en Estados Unidos, Gerardo Werthein, que fue nominado vicepresidente del Comité Olímpico Internacional esta semana. Con amabilidad, el ahora diplomático se negó a comentar los incidentes del partido entre Marruecos y Argentina y sus responsabilidades ante Clarín . El partido de rugby en que la Argentina perdió frente a Francia se produjo unas semanas después de las acusaciones de Hugo Auradou y Oscar Jegou, dos jugadores del rugby XV francés , acusados ​​de violación por parte de una mujer, la noche del 6 al 7 de julio en un hotel de Mendoza. Para el Eliseo, la presencia de Karina Milei se convirtió en un problema de status para el protocolo . Después de sus disculpas en nombre del gobierno al embajador francés en Buenos Aires por la canción racista de los jugadores argentinos con respecto a sus pares franceses en su celebraciones de la Copa América, Karina Milei , secretaria general de la presidencia, quiso participar en la inauguración de los Juegos Olímpicos en Francia. ¿Pero cómo?. El protocolo es rígido en esta celebración. Solo se acepta el presidente, la primera dama y el embajador de cada país. El status de Karina inquietó a Brigitte Macron, que había organizado un almuerzo para las primeras damas, que debía incluir entonces a Karina Milei. “¿Viene con su hermana?” preguntó Brigitte Macron, preocupada, junto a Emmanuel Macron en el Eliseo. “¿Entonces tengo que invitarla al almuerzo de primeras damas?” se preguntó, según fuentes diplomáticas. Flor de problema. Karina no quiere ser Primera Dama. Es “El Jefe”.Es la secretaria general de la Presidencia. No quiere comer con señoras primeras damas, que visitan museos y casas de modas cuando sus maridos trabajan. Por otra parte, los hermanos Milei tienen una rara costumbre: ni almuerzan ni cenan en público. Allí estaban Macron y Brigitte y los presidentes vivos de Francia: Francpoios Hollande y Julie, Nicolás Sarkozy y Carla Bruni, y los grandes empresarios e intelectuales del país. Si hay un día difícil para reunir a empresarios en París, es el día de la inauguración de los Juegos Olímpicos. La ciudad estará paralizada por los cortes, el temor a un atentado y la exigencia de un QR para todo el mundo, con zonas prohibidas de ingreso. Muchos empresarios decidieron salir de París y la embajada no tenía una lista definitiva de empresarios para una reunión mañana con Milei. Probablemente “la solución más fácil para este encuentro sea digital”, según un par de empresarios consultados por Clarín , “ante los problemas de circulación que habrá”. Al la tarde del viernes habrá un cóctel en el palacio del Eliseo para todos los presidentes y sus esposas el viernes. Desde allí, se irán todos juntos a las celebraciones de apertura de los Juegos Olímpicos. París está blindada. Esa es la solución logística más fácil , cuando hay 170 jefes de estado simultáneos , que deben subirse a barcos para pasear por el río Sena, en lo que amenaza con ser la más espectacular inauguración de la historia de los Juegos Olímpicos y la más incómoda e inaccesible para el resto de los parisinos. Cuando el presidente Emmanuel Macron reciba a su colega argentino Javier Milei este viernes,habrá leído una carta que le dirigieron 120 argentinos y franceses. En ella denuncian “cualquier acercamiento entre él y el presidente argentino Milei ”. El lunes 22 de julio de 2024,la Asamblea de Ciudadanos Argentinos en Francia, que reúne a exiliados, peronistas, kirchneristas y asociaciones como Hijos o familiares de desaparecidos franceses y argentinos durante la “guerra sucia”, le enviaron al presidente francés la carta. La misma que también habían publicado en el diario comunista en línea, L´Humanité el pasado 14 de junio. Hoy frente a la basílica de la Madeleine, muy cerca del Eliseo, se desplegó un poster en azul y rosado, los colores olímpicos, con una caricatura del presidente argentino, donde se leía : “Milei, Persona no Grata en los Juegos Olímpicos Paris 2024”. También se vio frente a estaciones de trenes y se transformó en petición.",

    "text": "Papa Francesco , condizioni critiche . Sono ore di preoccupazione e ansia per la salute del pontefice che dal 14 febbraio scorso è ricoverato all’ospedale Gemelli di Roma per complicazioni respiratorie sfociate in una polmonite bilaterale. Proprio nelle ultime ore aveva parlato il suo chirurgo, il professor Sergio Alfieri, che in una conferenza stampa aveva rilasciato alcune dichiarazioni.\n“Se la domanda è “Il Papa è fuori pericolo?”. No , ancora no . “Ma è in pericolo di vita, adesso?”. La risposta, ancora una volta, è no”. Difficile, tuttavia, che il Papa esca presto: resterà almeno tutta la prossima settimana. Per la prima volta il Vaticano ha parlato di “condizioni critiche” aggiungendo che il pontefice “aveva avuto bisogno di ossigeno supplementare e trasfusioni di sangue”.\nLeggi anche: “Papa Francesco non è fuori pericolo”. L’annuncio dei medici dei Gemelli: “Vuole che si dica la verità”\nCome sta adesso Papa Francesco: l’ultimo aggiornamento Secondo l’ultimo aggiornamento Papa Francesco ha passato una notte tranquilla . Il bollettino di domenica 23 febbraio era particolarmente atteso dopo la notizia della crisi respiratoria e della necessità di trasfusioni di sangue. Ebbene è importante che il pontefice abbia potuto riposare bene in questo momento così delicato.\nPurtroppo il bollettino di ieri, sabato, aveva parlato di criticità mai emerse prima: “Le condizioni del Santo Padre continuano ad essere critiche, pertanto, come spiegato – ha evidenziato l’équipe medica che lo ha in cura – il Papa non è fuori pericolo “.\n“Papa Francesco ha presentato una crisi respiratoria asmatiforme di entità prolungata nel tempo – era stato detto – che ha richiesto anche l’applicazione di ossigeno ad alti flussi. Gli esami del sangue odierni hanno inoltre evidenziato una piastrinopenia, associata ad un’anemia, che ha richiesto la somministrazione di emotrasfusioni. Il Santo Padre continua ad essere vigile e ha trascorso la giornata in poltrona anche se più sofferente rispetto a ieri. Al momento la prognosi è riservata”. E nel frattempo i fedeli in tutto il mondo pregano affinché il Papa possa riprendersi.\nPapa Francesco, cosa fa sapere una persona a lui molto vicina: “Perché è sotto attacco”",
