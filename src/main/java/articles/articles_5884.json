    "text": "Fin de semana inestable con lluvias y tormentas en Misiones\nLa Dirección General de Alerta Temprana prevé para el fin de semana tiempo inestable con lluvias y tormentas en Misiones. El sábado se esperan lluvias y tormentas desde el amanecer en toda la provincia, con mejoras temporarias. Un área de baja presión en la región podría aumentar la inestabilidad con ráfagas y lluvias intensas y no se descarta caída de granizo. Las temperaturas oscilarán entre 19 y 27°C.\nPersiste la inestabilidad y el ambiente templado a cálido el domingo. La jornada estará marcada por lluvias y tormentas, que serían más importantes para el sur y centro y, de menor intensidad para el norte provincial. En el sur podrían presentarse mejores condiciones meteorológicas ya desde media tarde, aunque serán temporarias.\nContinúan las lluvias con ambiente cálido a caluroso el lunes. Si bien la mayor inestabilidad ya estaría afectando los estados del sur del Brasil, continuarán las lluvias en Misiones en varios momentos del día, en general más leves, con algunas tormentas por la tarde. El ambiente caluroso afectará la zona sur con sensación térmica de 34°C, anticiparon desde el organismo dependiente del Ministerio de Ecología de la provincia.\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840173-tras-roturas-en-vidrios-insisten-que-con-la-urgente-necesidad-de-reparacion-de-calle-intransitable)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840171-rescatan-a-un-carpincho-acorralado-en-una-vivienda-de-san-vicente)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840168-los-pericos-sustituyen-a-lucas-sugo-en-la-fiesta-nacional-de-la-madera)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840167-regata-de-las-remadoras-rosas-en-la-playita-del-sol-una-jornada-de-solidaridad-y-rehabilitacion)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840163-la-costanera-se-prepara-para-una-nueva-edicion-de-manos-productivas)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840156-implementan-medidas-para-prevenir-el-atropellamiento-de-fauna-en-rutas-de-misiones)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840179-almafuerte-sera-sede-de-la-primera-edicion-de-misiones-ultra-trail)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840173-tras-roturas-en-vidrios-insisten-que-con-la-urgente-necesidad-de-reparacion-de-calle-intransitable)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840172-este-sabado-se-realizara-la-fiesta-provincial-de-estudiantes-en-montecarlo)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840171-rescatan-a-un-carpincho-acorralado-en-una-vivienda-de-san-vicente)\n[\n](/noticias/2024/11/01/840169-productores-de-san-pedro-apuntan-a-mejorar-la-plantacion-de-arandanos-para-el-proximo-ano)",

    "text": "Rice's two stunning free-kicks in the first leg set the Gunners on their way to dethroning the defending European champions.\nThe England international also won man of the match in the second leg as goals from Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli secured a famous win in Spain.\n\"It's such a special night for this club, it's a historic night for this club. We have an objective in this competition, we want to play the best teams and we want to win this competition,\" Rice told TNT Sports.\n\"There was a lot of talk coming here about them coming back because they've done it so many times before.\n\"But we had so much belief and confidence from that first leg that we could come here and win the game.\n\"We knew we were going to suffer but we knew we were going to win.\"\nArsenal will face Paris Saint-Germain in their first Champions League semi-final since 2009.\nThe London club have never won European football's top prize and last won the Premier League back in 2003/04.\nHowever, Rice, who joined from West Ham for a club record £105 million in 2023, believes major trophies are just around the corner for Mikel Arteta's men.\n\"It's massive. I sensed before I signed for the club that we were on an upwards trajectory,\" he added.\n\"This club is going to do special things in the coming years. We all fully believe in it, we have full trust in this manger - he's unbelievable!\n\"Semi-finals is massive for us and we want to take tonight in.\"\nMadrid rarely threatened to overturn their first leg deficit but Rice and Arsenal had to survive a scare after he was initially penalised for a foul on Kylian Mbappe inside the penalty area in the first half.\nAfter a lengthy VAR check, the spot-kick was eventually ruled out and a yellow card that would have ruled Rice out of the first leg of the semi-final was rescinded.\n\"I knew it wasn't a penalty,\" said Rice. \"He just fell to the floor.\"",

    "text": "Assam: Conversion in Majuli worries xatra body Sanatan Dharma leaders are concerned about the conversion of tribal people in Majuli from Hinduism to Christianity and said this needs to be studied and the trend arrested, said the Asom Sattra Mahasabha. STAFF REPORTER GUWAHATI: Sanatan Dharma leaders are concerned about the conversion of tribal people in Majuli from Hinduism to Christianity and said this needs to be studied and the trend arrested, said the Asom Sattra Mahasabha. The tribal people of Majuli, mainly those from the Mising community, have lately been converting to Christianity in large numbers, and this has set the alarm bells ringing in Sanatan Dharma circles, it was stated. The Asom Sattra Mahasabha pointed out that the Majuli LAC is currently reserved for STs and that it should be dereserved so that people from the general community can participate in elections. Talking to The Sentinel, secretary-general of the Asom Sattra Mahasabha, Kusum Kumar Mahanta, said, \"The strains of Borgeet can still be heard in Majuli, but the chorus of carols is also becoming more audible. Christian missionaries are making inroads into the tribal communities, and they are enticing the tribal people with money, education and medical facilities, etc. But once someone is converted, they are no longer given any attention. So, organizations linked to the Sanatan Dharma are looking for ways to stop this conversion and bring the tribal people back to their fold.\" \"The [xatras ](https://www.sentinelassam.com/north-east-india-news/assam-news/commission-for-review-assessment-visits-xatras-in-lakhimpur-681877)in Majuli also have a responsibility to ensure that the conversion stops. There may be a conspiracy in the conversion process, and this angle should be examined by the state government,\" he asserted. He also pointed out that the number of Christians among the tribal populace is increasing, and coupled with the fact that the LAC is reserved for STs, there should be a rethink by the government to dereserve the LAC.

    "text": "People watching the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM)’s landing on the moon (Photo: Reuters)\nTokyo [Japan], January 20 (ANI): Japan created history by becoming only the fifth nation to successfully complete the soft landing on the moon with its ‘Moon Sniper’ robotic explorer, but fear looms that the mission may end prematurely since the spacecraft’s solar cell is not generating electricity, CNN reported, citing the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.\nThe agency said it is currently receiving a signal from the lander, which is communicating as expected.\nThe uncrewed Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, mission landed just after 10:20 am ET Friday (12:20 am local time), according to telemetry data shared on JAXA’s live broadcast.\nCurrently, the lander is operating on limited battery power, only expected to last several hours, and the JAXA team is analyzing the data to determine the cause of the solar cell issue and the next steps for the lander. The solar cell issue may be because the spacecraft is not pointing in the intended direction, JAXA officials said.\nAccording to CNN, there is still hope that as the solar angle changes on the moon, the solar cell may be able to charge again, but that may take some time and will depend on whether SLIM can survive the frigid lunar night, the team shared during a news conference.\nThe agency believes the mission has met the criteria to declare it a “minimum success,” because the spacecraft achieved a precise and soft lunar landing using optical navigation. The landing makes Japan the third country to land on the moon this century, and the fifth overall.\nWhen asked to score the landing operation for SLIM, JAXA director general Dr. Hitoshi Kuninaka gave it a “60 out of 100,” while also mentioning that he is known for making “harsh comments.”\nThe team is also working to gather all of the scientific data obtained by the lander.\nThe lander was able to release its two lunar rovers, LEV-1 and LEV-2. The LEV-1 rover moves using a hopping mechanism and is equipped with wide-angle visible light cameras, scientific equipment and antennas that allow it to communicate with Earth, CNN reported. The LEV-2 also outfitted with cameras, can change shape to move across the lunar surface.\nMeanwhile, the team is receiving a signal from LEV-1 and will see if its cameras were able to capture any images, and they will not definitively confirm the status of LEV-2 until more data is received.\nThe small-scale SLIM robotic explorer, which launched in September, goes by the nickname “Moon Sniper” because it carried new precision technology to demonstrate a “pinpoint” landing.\nPrevious lunar missions have been able to target and reach specific zones that spanned many kilometres, but the SLIM lander targeted a landing site that stretches just 100 meters (328 feet) across. The lander’s “smart eyes” — an image-matching-based navigation technology — rapidly photographed the lunar surface on approach and autonomously made adjustments as the spacecraft descended to touchdown on a sloped surface, as reported by CNN.\nThe JAXA team is still working to determine the accuracy of SLIM’s landing, which could take up to a month.

Uwineza said that it all started immediately after completing her secondary school education when she was participating in Ingando civic education course, where she and her colleagues were briefed about various government programmes, on the country’s issues and the role of the youth in building the nation “We held dialogues with various officials from government organs including the military,” she said. “I was inspired, mostly by the talks delivered by military personnel. They included men and women. Especially because we were having the discourses wearing [military] uniforms, I felt like I would not take off the fatigues. As such, after the Ingando conclusion, I had decided to join the army,” she expressed.

Later, she became a military officer and carried out various military jobs with various responsibilities including serving peacekeeping missions across Africa. Meanwhile, she said, she pursued advanced military courses and training. “Today, as we celebrate International Women’s Day, the women in development over the last 30 years, I am a female colonel having both [military] job, and family responsibilities. “I am married – my husband is not a soldier – and I have children. There are not light responsibilities, but they must be effectively accomplished,” she said. She said that what helps her and her female colleagues in the army to effectively discharge their duties “is understanding that it is possible, willingness and determination, but also the leadership that offers us opportunity based on our ability”. She told parents to assume their responsibilities to support their children, foster hope among them in what they want to achieve, and avoid discouraging them by saying that there are things they cannot attain, or they cannot be just because they are girls. “I would like to tell girls who are here that there are various ways to love and serve the country, and the army is one of them. It requires force – which you have – it’s just the matter of coupling that with willingness,” she said. “You should make use of the opportunities you have because good leadership supports you. Build your capacity as it is the enabler of what you want to achieve,” She advised, indicating that there are female members of the military personnel including engineers in different fields, pilots, doctors, technicians, and those operating varied military equipment.",
