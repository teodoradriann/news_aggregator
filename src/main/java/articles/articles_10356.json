    "text": "MELAKA (June 12): The government is mulling over the proposal to establish a Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Commission, in line with the TVET reform agenda that is being actively implemented.\nPrime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said this was because the development of TVET under the National TVET Council, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, has shown encouraging results, including an increase in the number of students.\n“I appreciate the role of the TVET Council, but as those closely monitoring the sector’s development, we must consider proposals such as establishing a dedicated commission for TVET, and we will assess this as swiftly as possible, in response to the sector’s evolving needs.\n“With the number of students and types of training increasing, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and I will look into whether current facilities are adequate, and how to create synergy between government-linked companies, private sector players, and existing TVET institutions.”\nAnwar said this when opening the National TVET Day 2025 celebration at the Melaka International Trade Centre (MITC), Ayer Keroh, here on Thursday.\nIn his speech, Anwar also emphasised the importance of TVET in producing a skilled and quality workforce that meets future industry needs.\nHence, he said he believes that TVET graduates deserve a better starting salary, reflecting their skills and strong employability.\n“Previously, we set the minimum wage at RM1,700. But if a group like TVET graduates achieves up to 98% employability, RM1,700 is not enough. For TVET graduates, if possible, we want to raise the starting salary to as much as RM3,000,” he said.\nAnwar also highlighted that this adjustment is vital to ensure the expertise of TVET graduates is valued and accepted by multinational and local companies alike.\nDuring the event, he also announced an additional allocation of RM40 million for the National TVET Council, and RM10 million for Melaka, to focus on TVET entrepreneurship development.\nPresent at the event were Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Melaka Chief Minister Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh, Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir, and Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek.\nThe National TVET Day 2025 celebration, themed TVET: Pilihan Utama Kerjaya, featured nine exhibition sectors — Transportation and Automotive; Aerospace; Electronics and Digital; Advanced Manufacturing; Energy; Rail and Maritime; Plantation, Agriculture, and Livestock; Construction; and Services.\nThe three-day celebration, which began on Wednesday (June 11), offers about 5,000 job opportunities across various fields, from over 60 companies and employers from within and outside Melaka.\nA total of 12 ministries were involved in organising the event, including the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Human Resources, and the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (Miti).\nCelebrated annually on June 2, National TVET Day underscores the government’s commitment to making TVET a key platform for nurturing a dynamic, skilled, and competitive future workforce.\nCoinciding with the event, the 4th Regional Policy Dialogue of the Asean TVET Council (ATC 4th RPD) also took place over two days, starting Wednesday.\nUploaded by Liza Shireen Koshy",

    "text": "This is a lawsuit in which The New York Times accuses OpenAI of illegal use of the publication’s texts for ChatGPT training.\nThe New York Times stated that OpenAI (and Microsoft) have created their AI models by «copying and using millions» of the publication’s articles and as a result now «directly compete» with their content. The complaint also alleged that these AI models «threaten high-quality journalism by harming the news agencies’ ability to protect and monetize content.\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times filed an additional statement informing the judge that engineers at AI startup «accidentally erased evidence» proving ChatGPT’s copyright infringement. Some data has been recovered, but «the original file names and folder structure» with evidence are still unavailable.\nOpenAI spokesman Jason Deutrom denied the NYT’s claims and promised that the «company would provide its response to» in the near future.\nEarlier in the lawsuit, OpenAI was ordered to disclose information about the training data for ChatGPT. The NYT team spent «more than 150 hours» studying the data before some of it disappeared — at the same time, the plaintiff did not claim that the deletion was intentional\nSource: Engadget",
