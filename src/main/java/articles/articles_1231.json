    "text": "Why is my Fish Bloated and Swimming Upside Down? The distressing sight of a bloated fish struggling to swim upside down is often indicative of a swim bladder disorder (SBD) , although other conditions can mimic these symptoms. The swim bladder is an internal gas-filled organ that helps fish maintain buoyancy. When it malfunctions, your fish can experience difficulty controlling its position in the water, leading to the characteristic symptoms of floating, sinking, or swimming upside down. Bloating adds another layer of complexity, suggesting potential digestive issues, internal infections, or organ failure. Essentially, you’re likely dealing with a sick fish battling to stay upright.\nThe root cause can be diverse, ranging from poor water quality and dietary issues to bacterial infections and parasitic infestations . Sometimes, it’s even related to the physical conformation of certain fish breeds like fancy goldfish. Pinpointing the exact cause is crucial for providing appropriate treatment and improving your fish’s chances of recovery. This issue can be extremely stressful for your fish.\nUnderstanding the Underlying Causes 1. Swim Bladder Disorder What is it? As mentioned, SBD refers to any condition affecting the swim bladder’s ability to function correctly. This could be inflammation, physical damage, or a disruption in the gas regulation process. Causes: Constipation: A common culprit, especially in fish with compressed body shapes like fancy goldfish. Overfeeding or a diet lacking fiber can lead to constipation, pressing on the swim bladder. Infections: Bacterial or parasitic infections can directly affect the swim bladder, causing inflammation and malfunction. Poor Water Quality: High levels of ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate can stress fish and weaken their immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections that affect the swim bladder. Physical Injury: Physical trauma, such as from being handled roughly or bumping into tank decorations, can damage the swim bladder. Genetic Predisposition: Some fish species are genetically predisposed to swim bladder problems due to their body shape. 2. Dietary Issues Overfeeding: Feeding your fish too much can lead to constipation and bloat, putting pressure on the swim bladder. Poor Diet: A diet lacking in fiber can also contribute to constipation. Some foods, especially those high in carbohydrates, can cause gas buildup in the digestive system. Air Ingestion: Fish that gulp air at the surface while eating can swallow excessive amounts of air, disrupting their buoyancy. 3. Bacterial Infections Systemic Infections: Bacterial infections can spread throughout the fish’s body, affecting various organs, including the swim bladder. Specific Bacterial Infections: Certain bacterial strains are known to specifically target the swim bladder. 4. Parasitic Infestations Internal Parasites: Internal parasites can damage organs, including the swim bladder, leading to dysfunction. External Parasites: While less common, severe external parasite infestations can stress fish and weaken their immune systems, making them more susceptible to other problems, including SBD. 5. Water Quality Problems Ammonia and Nitrite Poisoning: High levels of ammonia and nitrite are toxic to fish and can damage their organs, including the swim bladder. pH Imbalance: Extreme pH levels can stress fish and weaken their immune systems. Low Dissolved Oxygen: Insufficient oxygen levels in the water can stress fish and make them more susceptible to disease. The Environmental Literacy Council stresses the importance of these parameters. Diagnosing the Problem While observing your fish’s symptoms is important, accurate diagnosis often requires considering the following:\nWater Testing: Regularly test your tank water for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH. This will help you identify any water quality issues that may be contributing to the problem. Observation: Carefully observe your fish’s behavior. Are they eating normally? Are they swimming erratically? Are there any other visible signs of illness, such as fin rot or lesions? Consider the Fish Species: Some species, like fancy goldfish, are simply more prone to swim bladder problems than others. Treatment and Management Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but here are some general strategies:\n1. Water Quality Improvement Water Changes: Perform regular partial water changes to maintain good water quality. Appropriate Filtration: Ensure your tank has adequate filtration to remove waste products. Proper Aeration: Provide sufficient aeration to maintain adequate dissolved oxygen levels. 2. Dietary Adjustments Fasting: Fast your fish for 2-3 days to allow their digestive system to clear. Fiber-Rich Diet: Feed your fish a diet rich in fiber, such as blanched peas (with the skin removed) or daphnia. Soaked Food: Soak dry food before feeding to prevent it from expanding in the fish’s stomach. Avoid Overfeeding: Only feed your fish the amount of food they can consume in 2-3 minutes. 3. Medication Antibiotics: If a bacterial infection is suspected, treat with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Anti-Parasitics: If parasites are suspected, treat with an appropriate anti-parasitic medication. Epsom Salt: Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) can help relieve constipation and reduce swelling. Add 1-2 teaspoons per 5 gallons of water. 4. Temperature Adjustment Raise Temperature: Gradually increasing the water temperature by a few degrees can help boost the fish’s metabolism and immune system. However, make sure this is appropriate for the species of fish. 5. Isolation Quarantine: If you suspect a contagious disease, quarantine the affected fish in a separate tank to prevent the spread of infection to other fish. By separating the fish it can better be treated and have its symptoms observed. 6. Supportive Care Shallow Water: If the fish is having difficulty swimming, consider lowering the water level in the tank to make it easier for them to reach the surface. Gentle Handling: Avoid handling the fish unnecessarily, as this can cause additional stress. Prevention Preventing swim bladder problems is always better than trying to cure them. Here are some preventative measures:\nMaintain Excellent Water Quality: Regularly test and maintain optimal water parameters. Provide a Balanced Diet: Feed your fish a varied and nutritious diet appropriate for their species. Avoid Overfeeding: Feed your fish small amounts of food multiple times a day rather than one large meal. Quarantine New Fish: Quarantine new fish for several weeks before introducing them to your main tank to prevent the spread of disease. Choose Fish Wisely: Be aware that certain fish species are more prone to swim bladder problems than others. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Can swim bladder disease kill my fish? Yes, if left untreated, swim bladder disease can be fatal. The constant struggle to maintain buoyancy can stress the fish, weaken its immune system, and make it more susceptible to secondary infections. Bacterial infection of the swim bladder causes fish to lose control of their buoyancy which results in severe stress and untimely death.\n2. Is swim bladder disease contagious? Generally, no. Swim bladder disorder itself isn’t contagious, but the underlying causes, such as bacterial or parasitic infections, can be contagious. That’s why it’s crucial to quarantine sick fish. The disease is not contagious, and will not be transmitted to other fish within the same tank.\n3. How long does it take for a fish to recover from swim bladder disorder? Recovery time varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of the treatment. Some fish may recover within a few days, while others may take several weeks. If the disease is mild and the fish receives proper care, it may recover within a few days to a couple of weeks.\n4. Can Epsom salt cure swim bladder disorder? Epsom salt can help alleviate symptoms like constipation and swelling, which can contribute to swim bladder problems. However, it’s not a cure-all. Magnesium is a mineral that is important for many systems of the human body — especially the nerves and muscles. It’s also beneficial to aquarium fish suffering from maladies such as dropsy, constipation, and swim bladder disorder.\n5. What does a swim bladder look like? A swim bladder can best be described as a thin sausage skin inflated with air. It is a very delicate organ which runs centrally through the core of the fish. The length of it depends upon the species of fish.\n6. Is it okay to leave a fish with swim bladder problems in the tank with other fish? It depends. If you suspect a contagious infection, quarantine the sick fish. If the problem is due to constipation or a physical injury, it may be safe to leave the fish in the tank, but monitor the other fish closely. It will be best to separate the fish from others so it can better be treated and have its symptoms observed.\n7. How do I prepare peas for a fish with swim bladder disease? Remove the outer skin of a frozen pea, then boil or microwave it until soft. Mash the pea into small pieces and feed them to the fish. Do fish with swim bladder disease suffer? Bacterial infection of the swim bladder causes fish to lose control of their buoyancy which results in severe stress and untimely death.\n8. My fish is swimming upside down but still eating. Is there hope? Yes, the fact that your fish is still eating is a good sign. Continue providing appropriate treatment and monitor their progress closely.\n9. What should I do if my fish doesn’t improve after treatment? Consult with a veterinarian specializing in aquatic animals. They may be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and recommend more specific treatments. Step 4: Call Your Veterinarian About Your Sick Fish.\n10. Can overfeeding directly cause swim bladder disease? Yes, overfeeding, especially with foods low in fiber, can lead to constipation and bloat, which can put pressure on the swim bladder. However, the most common causes for this disorder are overfeeding and/or feeding a poor diet lacking in fiber, which sometimes cause gas in the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to severe constipation that would cause the abdomen to swell, preventing the swim bladder from functioning properly.\n11. Is there a specific type of food that’s best for preventing swim bladder problems? A varied diet that includes high-quality flake food, frozen foods (like daphnia and bloodworms), and occasional vegetable matter is generally recommended.\n12. How often should I perform water changes? The frequency of water changes depends on the size of your tank, the number of fish, and the effectiveness of your filtration system. A good rule of thumb is to perform a 25% water change every 1-2 weeks.\n13. Can stress cause swim bladder problems? Yes, stress from poor water quality, overcrowding, or aggression from other fish can weaken a fish’s immune system and make them more susceptible to swim bladder problems. Many times, fish with buoyancy disorders are simply stressed from poor water quality.\n14. Why is my fish suddenly bloated? This could be caused by a number of things, such as a swim bladder problem, constipation or an internal infection. ✔ Make sure that the water quality is pristine. Causes of Fish Bloat: There are a number of factors that can contribute to the development of fish bloat.\n15. Should you leave a dying fish in the tank? No, remove it – for 2 reasons. One is that unless you know for certain that the fish didn’t die of disease or parasites, you risk infection/infestation of the other fish by them eating a diseased or parasite-compromised fish. The other is that decomposition puts off additional ammonia in the water.

    "text": "Predictive Analysis Coming for Potholes in San Diego An audit last spring recommended that the city use mapping software to reduce the distances between pothole jobs; the city will explore it. San Diego’s push for better city services in low-income neighborhoods will soon extend to pothole repair, where officials say they plan to start using predictive analysis to find pothole hotspots that don’t get reported. While San Diego has made significant progress in recent years speeding up pothole repairs and handling them more efficiently, officials said this week that their complaint-based approach raises social equity concerns. Significantly fewer potholes get reported in San Diego’s low-income areas than in high-income areas, a problem city officials suggest may be related to language barriers, lack of technology and less trust in government. “Quite frankly, I think there are certain expectations that are different in different communities — the bar has been set very low over the years,” City Council President Sean Elo-Rivera said of the city’s low-income areas. “Sadly, potholes aren’t the worst thing they are dealing with on a day-to-day basis, nor are they things that are expected to be filled quickly,” said Elo-Rivera, who represents mid-city District 9. “When those expectations are low, the reporting of potholes doesn’t necessarily come forward in the same way as it might from other parts of the city.” In response to a The analysis will be based partly on the overall condition of a street segment in a comprehensive survey completed last year, Hadley said. Another key factor will be how recently the segment was paved or slurried, he said. Evidence of equity problems includes much lower numbers of potholes being reported in the city’s three poorest council districts. Each of the city’s nine districts would account for just over 11% of pothole reports if reports were distributed equally across the city. But South Bay District 8 accounts for just 6% of reports, southeastern District 4 is the source of 8% and mid-city District 9 makes up 11%. Meanwhile, higher-income Districts 2, 3 and 6 each account for 14% or more of pothole reports. City officials said, however, that the analysis will need to be more complex than just using those disparities. A key factor in predicting potholes is whether a street has heavy traffic, and the city’s high-income areas tend to have more heavily trafficked streets. Officials also note that Districts 4, 8 and 9 have fewer total miles of roadway. Councilmember Vivian Moreno, who represents District 8 , said she’s certain underreporting is a key factor in the pothole reporting disparities. “There’s a whole lot of potholes that need to be addressed in District 8 , so there’s clearly an issue related to reporting,” said Moreno, suggesting key factors are language barriers and lack of access to the city’s online complaint app, Get It Done. “If there is a barrier to someone to report something, they are less likely to report it,” she said. Councilmember Joe LaCava, who represents high-income north coastal District 1 , said he supports the new equity approach on potholes. “People don’t have the Get It Done app, they don’t trust government or they don’t want to call attention to their particular neighborhood,” he said, explaining why people in low-income areas may be less likely to report potholes. But LaCava stressed that San Diego has come a long way on potholes in recent years. “I know I’ve seen a remarkable sea change,” said LaCava, adding that potholes are no longer the No. 1 complaint his office gets. City officials said potholes now get repaired within three days, on average, except during rainy season. And they said the backlog last March, the highest backlog of the year, was 393 — far less than previous years when the backlog often climbed over 2,000. Things are likely to get even better in about a year when the city gets a new patching truck it just bought for $174,000. The recent audit, which was released last spring, also recommended the city add mapping software to increase efficiency by reducing the distances between pothole jobs. City officials have agreed to explore such software, but Hadley said it’s unlikely to matter outside of the rainy winter months. “Ten months out of the year, we’re responding to potholes within three days,” said Hadley, contending that mapping software would only help with higher volumes of pothole repairs. “But there is a portion of the year when the numbers go up, so that sort of software could become beneficial for us.” The audit said mapping software would let crews repair 27% more potholes at no extra cost. It said it would also reduce their driving distances by 40%. San Diego spends about $4 million a year on pothole repair. Recent innovations include having crews work four 10-hour shifts instead of five eight-hour shifts. That is more efficient because each shift must start with a trip to get asphalt in Miramar. Another innovation was the “hot roads” initiative, where crews mill and pave streets more frequently if those streets historically get lots of potholes. ©2024 The San Diego Union-Tribune.

    "title": "Xbox PC App Criticised For 'Slow Downloads' Following Black Ops 6 Update",
    "text": "The first season of [Call of Duty: Black Ops 6](games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_6) officially arrived yesterday, and that meant a [huge update arrived for the game](https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/11/black-ops-6-season-01-update-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes-for-xbox) across all platforms. The update seemed to go smoothly for most... aside from on the Xbox App for PC.\nYesterday, one of the biggest trends on Google (yes, we obviously monitor those!) was an array of searches related to \"Xbox app slow download\" - and other phrases along those lines. Basically, people were searching for ways to try and figure out why they couldn't download the update any faster... which clearly isn't an ideal scenario for Microsoft.\nDelve deeper, and you'll find that it was a fairly big topic on social media - here are just a few examples:\nSo, it turns out the best solution was to download the update via the Microsoft Store rather than directly on the Xbox app, which obviously isn't the way that Team Xbox intends it - but it was a necessary step for many last night.\nThat's Black Ops 6, then, but what about everything else? Well, for the most part, we've found that the Xbox PC app has been good for us, and there definitely aren't as many complaints on a regular basis about its speeds... but they still crop up for sure. Xbox is seemingly on the case, as you can see in this example - where the user known as \"mistur_niceguy\" is a verified Xbox engineer. This specific exchange was from five months ago:\nPC is a very difficult beast when you consider all the different configurations and settings that users are wielding, so it's bound to result in download issues for certain people at certain times. Given that [PC is becoming such a big focus for Xbox](https://www.purexbox.com/features/reaction-like-it-or-not-xbox-has-gone-full-throttle-on-multiplatform) these days though, Microsoft will surely be keen to avoid a repeat of yesterday's Black Ops 6 saga.",
