    "text": "España.- Salvamento Marítimo de España rescató en los dos últimos días al menos a 661 inmigrantes provenientes de África que viajaban en embarcaciones precarias en aguas próximas de las Islas Canarias (Atlántico).\nEste jueves, las autoridades españolas rescataron cinco ‘cayucos’ con al menos 274 personas a bordo, la mayoría de origen subsahariano.\nDos de ellas fueron rescatadas en aguas canarias por la mañana y llevadas a la isla de Tenerife. En una viajaban 63 personas, todos varones; en la otra, entre los 66 ocupantes, había cinco mujeres y un bebé.\nHoras más tarde fue localizada otra barcaza con 67 personas, entre ellas tres mujeres y un posible menor de edad, que fueron remolcados hasta El Hierro. Según el relato de los propios migrantes, realizaron una travesía de cinco días desde Nuadibú, en la costa de Mauritania, y provenían de Senegal, Mali, Gambia, Guinea-Conakry y Costa de Marfil.\nPor la tarde se informó de la llegada de otros dos ‘cayucos’ a El Hierro. Uno tenía 58 personas en su interior, todos varones de Mauritania y Mali en aparente buen estado de salud. En la otra embarcación, con 20 hombres a bordo, los migrantes dijeron proceder de Mauritania, Senegal y Mali.\nEstas llegadas se unen a las al menos 387 personas que fueron interceptadas por las autoridades españoles el miércoles, día de Navidad, en siete embarcaciones precarias localizadas en aguas cercanas al archipiélago.\nDesde que comenzó el año y hasta el 15 de diciembre, llegaron a las Islas Canarias 43.737 inmigrantes en embarcaciones precarias, un 18,6 % más que en el mismo periodo de 2023, según los últimos datos del Ministerio de Interior español.\nEstas embarcaciones llegan a través de la conocida como ruta canaria de la emigración, que va desde las costas de África a las Islas Canarias a través del Atlántico, considerada como la ruta más peligrosa del mundo para los emigrantes, pero eso no disuade a miles de personas para embarcar en pequeñas lanchas con el objetivo de alcanzar suelo europeo.\nSegún los cálculos de la ONG Caminando Fronteras, este año han muerto 10.457 personas en su intento de llegar a las costas españolas, lo que supone una media de casi 30 al día y un incremento del 58 por ciento respecto al año anterior.\nRecibe las últimas noticias en tu casilla de email",

    "text": "Europe's flying taxi dreams falter as cash runs short\nImage source, Volocopter Image caption, The VoloCity made demonstration flights in Paris over the summer\nTheo Leggett & Ben Morris BBC Money and Work Published 15 November 2024 Updated 27 November 2024 One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.\nGermany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.\nIt never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.\nWhile missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.\nTalks to borrow €100m (£83m; $106m) from the government failed in April , external .\nNow hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report , external . The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.\nVolocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.\nTheir machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.\nHowever, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.\nImage source, Lilium Image caption, Lilium's radical design involves jets which can be angled for vertical take-off\nOne of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.\nThe German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme .\nLilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.\nThe concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.\nIt was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.\nAs recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium’s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.\n“We are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. “But this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We’re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised €1.5bn”.\nBut then the money ran out.\nLilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth €100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.\nIn early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.\nFor the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.\nImage source, Vertical Aerospace Image caption, The VX4 recently completed successful take-off and landing tests\nThe high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.\nIts striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be “100 times” safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.\nThe company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.\nBut there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.\nIn May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal , external to supply electric motors for the aircraft.\nAmbitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.\nBut the company has been through financial challenges and recently agreed , external a rescue deal with its biggest creditor, US based Mudrick Capital.\nUnder the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.\nThat will leave the US investment firm with a 70% stake in Vertical, while Mr Fitzpatrick's stake falls from 70% to 20%.\n\"This comprehensive deal - alongside the recent piloted flight campaign... means Vertical is positioned to be a winner in one of the 21st century’s most exciting technologies,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said in a statement accompanying the deal.\nImage source, Airbus Image caption, CityAirbus has an 80km range and can fly at 120kmh\nAmid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.\nHe says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus , external is likely to survive.\nCalled the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.\n\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.\nElsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.\nOnce the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.\nThe first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?\n\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.\nGiven all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.\n\"No one wanted to miss out on the next Tesla,\" laughs Mr Fehrm.\nFollow BBC Technology of Business Editor Ben Morris on BlueSky , external\nFollow BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett on BlueSky , external\nRelated topics Europe France International Business Transport Aerospace Air travel Technology of Business",

    "title": "Patriots Tipped to Trade Mac Jones for 7th-Round Draft Pick",
    "text": "The\nNew England Patriots shouldn’t expect to get much for Mac Jones if they trade the quarterback this offseason. In fact, Spotrac.com’s Michael Ginnitti believes “a 2024 7th round pick swap” with the San Francisco 49ers is the best the Pats can hope to fetch for the player selected 15th overall in the 2021 NFL draft.\nGinnitti made his prediction as part of a breakdown of how every team’s quarterback situation will play out during the offseason. He noted how the Patriots have options regarding Jones, including a trade or paying “his fully guaranteed $2.78M salary as a buyout.”\nStriking a deal with the Niners makes sense. Especially since the NFC West franchise has two backup passers,\nSam Darnold and Brandon Allen, “on expiring contracts right now.”\nThis isn’t the first time the idea of Jones moving to the Bay Area has been floated. He’d be a good fit for the offense called by 49ers’ head coach Kyle Shanahan.\nJones’ struggles making the grade in the Patriots’ system is a big reason why Bill Belichick’s job security has become an issue in New England.\nTrade to 49ers Makes Sense for Mac Jones\nJones and the 49ers are a popular trade duo among writers predicting the league’s next wave of prominent deals. They were\npaired together back in November, in a report based on ESPN’s Bill Barnwell believing the 49ers are “an obvious landing spot given Kyle Shanahan’s reported interest before the Niners drafted Trey Lance.”\nThe scheme fit is obvious, particularly given Jones’ ability to gash defenses in the play-action game. He amassed 888 yards on 104 play-action passes in 2021, per\nPro Football Reference, but Jones’ numbers in this area have decreased every season since.\nThat decline makes little sense when Jones was flawless throwing off of play action during a big win over the\nTennessee Titans during his rookie year, per Next Gen Stats.\nJones wouldn’t be lacking play-action opportunities in San Francisco. Not when current starter\nBrock Purdy has attempted 87 passes off play action and gained 933 yards.\nPurdy was near flawless in the PA game against the\nSeattle Seahawks in Week 12, per PFF SF 49ers.\nFew people would bet on Jones supplanting Purdy as starter, but the former would have a better chance of salvaging his pro career in Shanahan’s system. The Patriots would have a better chance to improve at football’s most important position without Jones hanging around as a reminder of past failures.\nMac Jones Has Suffered Rapid Decline\nIt’s still quite shocking how quickly Jones’ status has diminished. He went from a Pro Bowler as a rookie to somebody Belichick benched for\nBailey Zappe this season.\nBelichick shares more than a little responsibility for Jones’ swift regression. Not least because the coach inexplicably hired former defensive coordinator Matt Patricia and ex-Special Teams boss Joe Judge to run his offense in 2022.\nBill O’Brien returning as offensive coordinator was supposed to herald a revival for Jones. Instead, Zappe has looked more comfortable running O’Brien’s scheme.\nThe difference between how the two QBs have fared is summed up by Zappe taking more vertical shots. His ability to go deep was shown by this 37-yard connection with wide receiver\nJuJu Smith-Schuster against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 14, highlighted by https://twitter.com/NextGenStats/status/1732935604927950851.\nZappe “sits on a non-guaranteed $985,000 minimum salary next season,”\naccording to Ginnitti, but he still has more of a future with the Patriots than Jones. With Belichick’s job status also in doubt, the Pats would be wise to make a clean break at quarterback, starting with dealing Jones for whatever they can get.",
