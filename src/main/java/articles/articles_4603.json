    "text": "MADRID, 26 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) -\n El baloncestista español Sergio Llull, base del Real Madrid, ha dicho este jueves, tras convertirse frente al ALBA Berlin en el jugador con más partidos disputados en la historia de la Euroliga, que ese récord \"es consecuencia de estar en el mejor club del mundo tantos años\".\n \"Es una victoria importante fuera de casa para seguir sumando en la Euroliga y para intentar ir hacia arriba. Creo que el equipo ha hecho un partido muy sólido\", declaró Llull a los micrófonos de Realmadrid TV, después de la victoria merengue por 69-80 en su visita al ALBA durante la jornada 18 de la liga regular en la Euroliga 2024/25.\n \"Lo del récord es consecuencia de estar en el mejor club del mundo tantos años. Al final, juegas muchos partidos y es un honor igualar con Hines, un jugador que es una leyenda de la Euroliga; y vamos a por más\", indicó el base de Mahón, cuyos triples impulsaron al equipo blanco hacia el triunfo en el Uber Arena de la capital alemana.\n \"Es un récord especial porque estar ahí arriba en partidos jugados significa que has estado al máximo nivel en Euroliga muchos años. Yo no suelo guardarme nada. Hoy han entrado, he estado acertado y he podido ayudar al equipo en ese aspecto, pero siempre intento jugar al 100% para ayudar en lo que sea\", añadió Llull desde el vestuario del pabellón.\n El eterno dorsal 23 estuvo agradecido a la entidad madridista. \"Nunca voy a poder dar tanto al club como me ha dado él. Al final, el Real Madrid es lo que está por encima de cada jugador individualmente y para mí era un sueño fichar aquí. Es un sueño que sigo viviendo muchas veces y, por eso, intento siempre dejarme la piel para conseguir victorias y que la afición esté orgullosa\", señaló al respecto.\n Por último, abogó por \"tener un poco de paciencia\" pese a haber \"regalado muchos partidos\" en los últimos cuartos. \"Hemos perdido partidos por un punto, varios de ellos bastante crueles, que habiéndolos ganado estaríamos hablando de estar en 'playoffs' o incluso entre los cuatro primeros en una Euroliga tan igualada. Pero bueno, creo que el equipo está bien y es importante seguir en esta línea\", concluyó.\nLeer más acerca de: Real Madrid",

    "text": "A research team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has unearthed new findings which may help explain the connection between cancer risk and poor diet, as well as common diseases like diabetes, which arise from poor diet. The insights gained from this study hold promise for advancing cancer prevention strategies aimed at promoting healthy ageing. Led by Professor Ashok Venkitaraman, this ground-breaking study was conducted by scientists from the [Cancer Science Institute of Singapore](https://csi.nus.edu.sg/) (CSI Singapore) at NUS and [NUS Centre for Cancer Research](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/trp/n2cr/) (N2CR) under the [Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/), with colleagues from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). Prof Venkitaraman, Director of CSI Singapore, explained, \"Cancer is caused by the interaction between our genes and factors in our environment, such as diet, exercise, and pollution. How such environmental factors increase cancer risk is not yet very clear, but it is vital to understand the connection if we are to take preventive measures that help us stay healthy longer.\" A chemical linked to diabetes, obesity, and poor diet can heighten cancer risk The research team first studied patients who are at a high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancers because they inherit a faulty copy of the cancer gene - BRCA2 - from their parents. They demonstrated that cells from such patients were particularly sensitive to the effects of methylglyoxal, which is a chemical produced when our cells break down glucose to create energy. The study showed that this chemical can cause faults in our DNA that are early warning signs of cancer development. The team's research also suggested that people who do not inherit a faulty copy of BRCA2 but could experience higher-than-normal levels of methylglyoxal - such as patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes, which are connected with obesity or poor diet - can accumulate similar warning signs indicating a higher risk of developing cancer. Prof Venkitaraman elaborated, \"Our research suggests that patients with high methylglyoxal levels may have higher cancer risk. Methylglyoxal can be easily detected by a blood test for HbA1C, which could potentially be used as a marker. Furthermore, high methylglyoxal levels can usually be controlled with medicines and a good diet, creating avenues for proactive measures against the initiation of cancer.\" The study's first author, Dr Li Ren Kong, Lee Kuan Yew Fellow from N2CR, added, \"We started the study aiming to understand what factors elevate risk in families susceptible to cancer, but ended up discovering a deeper mechanism linking an essential energy consumption pathway to cancer development. These findings raise awareness of the impact of diet and weight control in the management of cancer risks.\" Novel mechanism for tumour formation Interestingly, the research team's work also revised a longstanding theory about certain cancer-preventing genes. This theory - called the Knudson's 'two-hit' paradigm - was first formulated in 1971, and it was proposed that these genes must be inactivated permanently in our cells before cancer can arise. The NUS team has now found that methylglyoxal can temporarily inactivate such cancer-preventing genes, suggesting that repeated episodes of poor diet or uncontrolled diabetes can 'add up' over time to increase cancer risk. This new knowledge is likely to be influential in changing the direction of future research in this area. The team's significant findings were published in [Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00255-1), which is one of the most influential scientific journals in biomedical research, on 11 April 2024. Next phase of research Building on their novel discoveries, the researchers aim to conduct further studies to understand if metabolic disorders, such as diabetes or poor diets, affect cancer risk in Singapore and other Asian countries. The research team also hopes to identify new mechanisms underlying the connection between metabolism, diet and cancer that they have discovered, to develop more effective approaches to prevent or delay the onset of cancer.

    "text": "By Larry Mahoney ,\n1 hour ago Hockey winger Ross Mitton, who was an assistant captain and Colgate University’s leading scorer this past season, is transferring to the University of Maine.\nMitton said he is “super excited” to join the Black Bears.\n“I really liked the coaching staff, and I loved the rink. We played there during Christmas break, and it was sold out even without students [on campus],” said Mitton, who will graduate with a degree in economics from Colgate this spring.\nMitton said he liked the fact the coaching staff got to know him as a person as well as a player.\nHe also said he met the players during a recent visit and that they were a “great group of guys.”\nUMaine beat Colgate 3-1 on Jan. 5, and the teams skated to a 4-4 tie the next night. Mitton assisted on the goal in Colgate’s loss.\nCollege Hockey News senior writer Mike McMahon wrote that Mitton will be “a really good addition for the Black Bears.”\n“[Mitton] plays a heavy game and he can score,” wrote McMahon. “I had him rated the number three available forward [in the NCAA Division I hockey transfer portal].”\nMitton, who stands 5-foot-10 and weighs 190 pounds, improved every year at Colgate, culminating with his 30-point campaign this season. He had 11 goals and 19 assists in 34 games including five goals and four assists over his last 10 contests.\nHe had 9-18-27 as a junior in 40 games, 5-7-12 in 35 games his sophomore year and 1-2-3 in 21 games as a freshman.\nColgate went 16-16-4 this season and finished third in ECAC regular season play with a 13-7-2 record. The Raiders were upset by St. Lawrence in the league quarterfinal series.\nMitton also said he feels the Black Bears are going to be an NCAA championship contender, and he wants to be part of that run.\nUMaine reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time since the 2011-12 season this past campaign and returns the vast majority of the team.\nUMaine wound up 23-12-2 and finished 10th in one season-ending national poll and 11th in the other.\nMitton, who will be 24 on July 5 and was born in Manhasset, New York, will be the fourth forward to land at UMaine from the portal to go with UMass’ Taylor Makar, UMass Lowell’s Owen Fowler and Clarkson’s Charlie Russell.\nUMaine has lost six forwards with freshman All-Hockey East second team selection Bradly Nadeau signing with the Carolina Hurricanes, who drafted him in the first round (30th overall) last summer; Donavan Houle passing up his fifth year to sign with the American Hockey League’s San Jose Barracuda; and four others entering the transfer portal in Parker Lindauer, Cole Hanson, Felix Trudeau and Reid Pabich.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
