    "text": "Brigitte Bardot: \"Non voglio morire in una Francia islamizzata. Papa? Un male\" “Servirebbe un governo autoritario. Cultura woke? Moda ridicola\". E su Bergoglio: \"Gli ho scritto e non mi ha risposto, che maleducato\" La grande attrice Brigitte Bardot: \"Non voglio morire in una Francia islamizzata\" \"Un tempo avrei detto che non volevo vivere in una Francia islamizzata. Oggi dico che non voglio morire in una Francia islamizzata!\" A dirlo è Brigitte Bardot in un’intervista al settimanale ultraconservatore Valeurs Actuelles. \"Gli assassini — spiega — sono spesso di origine islamica e lo rivendicano! In gran parte, sono purtroppo dei français de papier (immigrati che di francese hanno solo il documento, ndr) e spesso degli psicopatici. Dovremmo fare un esame psichiatrico a tutti i migranti che entrano prima di concedere loro il diritto d’asilo e la nazionalità francese\", afferma Bardot. Secondo la grande attrice, il problema \"è l’Islam in generale, l’invasione islamista, che sono spaventosamente pericolosi per l’identità e la cultura francesi\". A dimostrare che la nostra cultura è sotto scacco, riporta il Corriere della Sera, secondo Bardot c’è l’attacco che subisce il Natale: \"Ecco un’altra di quelle novità che escono dai cervelli malati dei nostri contemporanei che sporcano tutto ciò che è bello, puro, vero, per modernizzare e globalizzare valori ancestrali e tradizionali che sarebbe un sacrilegio toccare. Il “Wokismo” è una moda ridicola. Non accetto che si sporchi o siridicolizzi il sublime\". Bardot è critica anche nei confronti di papa Francesco: \"Non lo posso vedere. Fa molto male alla Chiesa. Io adoravo Giovanni Paolo II, mi ricordo del nostro bell’incontro, unico, molto caloroso, lui non era affatto un politico.Non incontrerò mai l’attuale Papa\". Si legge su Corriere della Sera, \"tra le sue critiche al Pontefice il fatto che non abbia risposto alle sue lettere. «Non si occupa dei cristiani d’Oriente e non ne parla mai. Quando ho saputo che si sarebbe chiamato Francesco, mi sono detta piena di speranza: se ha scelto questo nome, è perché ama gli animali. Gli ho inviato una lettera per congratularmi e ringraziarlo per aver scelto quel nome in onore di San Francesco d’Assisi. Speravo finalmente che avrebbe fatto qualcosa in più per migliorare la sorte degli animali nel mondo, ma non mi ha mai risposto. Gli ho inviato un’altra lettera,e mi ha fatto rispondere da un suo collaboratore che mi ringraziava, e bla bla. Trovo dunque che sia molto maleducato».

    "title": "Nut allergies caused by alcohol",
    "text": "Flavorings present in certain alcohols could cause severe allergic reactions, according to a new study from McGill University. Researchers also note that adults who know they are allergic do not use epinephrine enough before going to the emergency room.\nPosted at 4:21 p.m.\n“It was known that alcohol consumption increases the severity of allergic reactions,” explains Roy Khalaf, lead author and medical student at the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University, who is one of the co-authors of the published study. in the International Archives of Allergy and Immunology. “We found that alcohol is more commonly associated with nut allergies. Our hypothesis to explain this new observation is that certain alcohols have nutty aromas. »\nMr. Khalaf cites, for example, amaretto, galliano or amadeus. Even artificial flavors could be to blame.\nThe study analyzed the files of 1,135 adults who presented with an allergic reaction to the MUHC emergency room between 2011 and 2023. Half of the cases concerned nut allergies. In this group, one in six patients had consumed alcohol before the allergic reaction.\nOther studies have shown that alcohol increases the risk of a serious allergic reaction because it causes vasodilation, the increase in the diameter of blood vessels, according to Khalaf. “Vasodilation accentuates anaphylactic shock”, the cessation of breathing often associated with serious allergic reactions.\nOther hypotheses exist to explain the fact that alcohol increases the severity of allergic reactions, notes the study.\nBut alcohol is more present in patients with allergic reactions to nuts, compared to those who arrive at the emergency room because of an allergic reaction to other foods, such as milk or fish, or to a bite from a nut. insect or medication. This is what led McGill researchers to postulate an allergic effect of nut flavors in certain alcohols.\nA different reaction depending on age?\nThe study aimed to determine if the symptoms of adults who arrive at the emergency room because of an allergic reaction are different from children. This is not the case.\nTwo other analyzes were carried out in this sample of 1135 adults. One – seeing what type of alcohol was associated with allergic reactions to nuts – didn’t work because patients didn’t report that information. The other, on different symptoms in the elderly compared to adults under 65, will be published in the coming months.\n“We want to help emergency physicians recognize serious allergic reactions more quickly,” says Mr. Khalaf.\nEpinephrine\nThe other clinical impact of the study which has just been published will be on patients. “We see a lot of people who have already had an anaphylactic reaction, and therefore who normally have a prescription for epinephrine, who arrive at the emergency room without having received any,” says Mr. Khalaf. However, the severity of allergic reactions is less if you receive epinephrine quickly. »\nEpinephrine is a medication to counter an allergic reaction that is given by injector that is relatively easy to use. “We want to understand why people did not use their injector,” says Mr. Khalaf. With children, parents are often hesitant to use them. Maybe adults don’t take it with them, or don’t renew the prescription…”\nLearn more\n-\n- 2,5 millions\n- Number of Canadians who have ever had a serious allergic reaction\nSource : Canadian Anaphylaxis Initiative\n- 3500\n- Number of Canadians who have a serious food allergic reaction each year\nSource : Canadian Anaphylaxis Initiative\n-\n- 10 to 15\n- Number of Canadians who die from a serious food allergic reaction each year\nSource : Canadian Anaphylaxis Initiative",

    "text": "Ex-stripper and Hunter Biden’s ex-lover Lunden Roberts told Piers Morgan in an interview on Thursday that President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden have yet to meet their five-year-old granddaughter.\nRoberts, 33, who has a forthcoming book, told Morgan that she had suicidal thoughts after learning she was pregnant with Hunter Biden’s child and called her pregnancy “one of the loneliest times” of her life, as their “months-long” relationship ended when she told him she was pregnant.\n“I went through some pretty dark times emotionally and mentally during that time,” Roberts said, adding:\nI knew that, as long as I was pregnant, I wasn’t going to do anything to myself, because that would harm my child. So I didn’t think I would do anything to myself while I was pregnant. But I would feel that, after the pregnancy, would it be better for my daughter and for Hunter and everyone else if I wasn’t here? Because it seemed like a scandal, and a burden is what I felt like at those times.\nShe recalled feeling hurt when she read in a 2019 New Yorker profile that Hunter had denied ever having sex with her. “I can remember just reading it and just not having any words,” she said.\nRoberts met Biden while she was working as a stripper at the DC gentlemen’s club Mpire with the stage name “Dallas.”\nShe was put on Hunter’s company’s payroll for nine months, including while he was in a relationship with his late brother’s widow, Hallie, and struggling with a serious addiction to crack.\n“He had a demon on his back,” she told Morgan. “He was obviously suffering from addiction during that time. But he had my attention. I was intrigued.”\nShe said her daughter, Navy, and Hunter have had meetings on “Zoom,” but have not yet met in person, but said Navy is “well aware” her father has a lot going on.\n“She’s waited five years. She can wait a couple more months,” she said, about a prospective meeting with her father.\nWatch:\nHunter is currently facing trial for three felony charges related to his not disclosing he was using illegal drugs while purchasing a gun and illegally possessing it for 11 days, until Hallie Biden discovered it and threw it away in a trash can outside of a grocery store.\nRoberts said she hopes that Hunter does not go to jail and that President Joe Biden would pardon him if it came to that.\n“I feel like Hunter is one of those people that have always had great potential and he’s an amazing person to know,” Roberts said. “I always hoped that that demon and that addiction wouldn’t just pull him down because I saw it had it sank its claws in him. I always hoped that he was getting help.”\nBiden at first refused to acknowledge Navy as his daughter, but later settled a child support lawsuit with Roberts. President Biden only acknowledged Navy’s existence publicly for the first time last year.\nFollow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on ”X” , Truth Social , or on Facebook .\nPolitics Hunter Biden Joe Biden Lunden Roberts",
