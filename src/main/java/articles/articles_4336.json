    "title": "Ex-Ald. Edward M. Burke relied on Catholic card in effort to soften sentence in corruption case - Chicago Sun-Times",
    "text": "Ex-Ald. Edward M. Burke used Catholic card in bid to soften sentence in corruption case It’s unclear whether Catholic figures appealing for leniency in letters to the judge affected the two-year sentence given to Burke. But priests, nuns and lay church leaders went to bat heavy for him — after years of the ex-alderman funneling campaign cash to Catholic causes. Shortly after ex-Ald. Edward Burke was indicted on corruption charges in 2019, church officials said they would wait to see if he got convicted before deciding whether to return a $10,000 donation one of his campaign funds made to a Catholic charitable endeavor overseen by the Archdiocese of Chicago. “We are awaiting the outcome of the case before making a determination on the donation,” Paula Waters, a spokeswoman for Cardinal Blase Cupich, said at the time . Since then, Burke’s campaign committees have reported another $50,000 in expenditures to Catholic organizations — and Cupich’s aides won’t say whether they’ve given Burke back any money after his December conviction on racketeering, bribery and attempted extortion, or plan to. Catholic groups have relied on Burke’s campaign money over the years — with $100,000 given by Burke’s political funds in the three years before he was indicted. More recently, Burke relied on them to try to convince U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall to go easy on him when it came time to determine how long he should go to prison, if at all. Of the more than 200 letters of support sent to Kendall’s courtroom before she sentenced him Monday to two years in prison for corruption — she could have sent him away for eight years or more — 25 came from Catholic priests, nuns and lay church figures. They shared stories about Burke’s charitable deeds, commitment to Catholic schools and causes, or experience as a practicing Catholic and long-ago seminarian. One of Burke’s attorneys said at the sentencing hearing Burke was essentially a “priest without a collar.” It’s unclear whether Burke’s defense team pulled the Catholic card specifically to appeal to the religious sensibilities of a judge who attended Catholic high school and whose husband is the president of a Catholic school in Waukegan. Burke’s attorneys wouldn’t comment. Burke’s wife, former Illinois Supreme Court Justice Anne Burke, invoked Kendall’s faith in a letter in which she cited the judge’s participation in a Catholic women leadership event. “Compassion, you said, was a value from your Catholic education that you draw on and that you use prayer before making the difficult decisions you face in your work,” Anne Burke wrote. “I pray that you call upon the Holy Spirit to give you compassion when deciding our future.” If and how letters from Catholic figures impacted Kendall’s decision on Burke’s sentence, which also included a $2 million fine, is unclear. Kendall wouldn’t comment. But she did reference in court the good deeds conveyed by Burke’s supporters, saying, “These are very personal acts that are not anything to do with authority or public office.” The Rev. Dan Brandt, a Chicago police chaplain, wrote Kendall, “I cannot speak highly enough of Ed’s rich and active faith life, his good character and his love of neighbor.” Years earlier, Brandt spoke against the imprisonment of then-Mayor Richard M. Daley’s patronage chief Robert Sorich, calling his conviction on corruption charges a “miscarriage.” The Rev. Ken Velo, an aide to late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, wrote, “Your Honor, you are a just and fair judge. Knowing that, I hope that this good man, Edward Burke, is given every consideration possible.” The Rev. John Canary, who’d been vicar general under late Cardinal Francis George, wrote that he’s been a longtime friend to Burke, with whom he attended high school. “It would be a blessing if there might be some quality time remaining for him and his family together.” Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki, a priest for years in Chicago, wrote, “In my plea for leniency, I hope that his charitable generosity and the character of his civic life will be taken into consideration.” Some Catholic figures writing letters for Burke were leaders of groups that benefited from his campaign money, including Misericordia, which is based on the North Side and serves adults with mental and physical disabilities. Burke’s campaign funds — fueled by donors who often did business with City Hall or wanted to — made more than $3,000 in donations over the last five years to Misericordia, records show, and more than $100,000 overall over the last 25 years. The president of St. Rita High School who’s a Catholic deacon and, separately, an Augustinian priest who previously ran the South Side institution, each wrote on Burke’s behalf. The school has received almost $30,000 in total over the years from his political committees. Burke’s campaign funds made 14 $200 donations this year alone to St. Bruno Catholic Church at 4751 S. Harding Ave., with nearly $34,000 given over the last two decades. State Sen. Napoleon Harris' campaign spent $6,600 at high-end department stores, at least partly on clothes US agency wants to regulate apps that let workers access paychecks before payday, saying they provide loans",

Drivers should reduce their speeds and be on the look-out for fallen branches, and even trees, along with other debris.’\nThe RNLI urged those visiting the coast to exercise extreme caution, particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers.\nGareth Morrison, RNLI water safety partner, said: ‘The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea.

    "title": "#74 Un atentado islamista durante la misa de Navidad deja más de 160 cristianos asesinados en Nigeria",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\n[#65](c65#c-65) Las muertes no son sensacionalistas, la noticia es sensacionalista, y su falta de rigor, una falta de respeto a los que han sido asesinados. Además de aprovechar que el Pisuerga pasa por Valladolid para seguir esparciendo odio y desinformación...\nNo sé tú, pero yo este tipo de cosas ni las tolero ni me quedo callada, prefiero no ser cómplice de estas miserias.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#53](c53#c-53) ridiculizarlo si quieres.... Pero con Israel tenemos todo tipo de relaciones y bien estrechas, vamos de aliados, van de ser occidente, medio entran en europa, sobre todo socialmente, democracia plena etc etc ... No tiene absolutamente nada que ver.\nEsto es una masacre genocida por supuesto, ejem\n[#2](c2#c-2) .... Pro no es comparable. Si acaso, comparable a la masacre de Hamas.\n[#61](c61#c-61) Con Israel si, con Gaza no, mediáticamente deberíamos estar recibiendo un bombardeo de lavado de cara de Israel, pero es al contrario. Lo que esté bien o mal no me meto, no soy experto, pero la actitud de los medios ha cambiado y eso me inquieta.\nEs como si dentro de un mes encontramos todos los medios diciendo que Aznar ha sido el peor presidente, que hipotecó a España para décadas. Sería inquietante, llevan décadas lavándole la cara a Aznar y que cambien de rumbo significaría que algo ha pasado o que está habiendo algún cambio de poderes de influencia.\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992)\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\n[#13](c13#c-13) Se financian infinitud de proyectos e ideologías en los 5 continentes, para bien y para mal, y solo los “amigos de las cabras” son los que a posteriori se dedican al terrorismo.\n[#56](c56#c-56) con lo de los amigos de las cabras supongo q te refieres a los valerosos guerreros muyahidines, que junto a los USA liberaron del yugo comunista a Afganistán y lo convirtieron en la tierra de libertades que es hoy. No? O te refieres a las primaveras árabes? O a liberar libia? Iraq? El maidan de Ucrania?\n[#57](c57#c-57) La noticia habla de un atentado islamista. ¿ Tu de que crees que hablo ? P.S. No tengo nada contra las cabras.\n[#13](c13#c-13) \"les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo\"\nLeyenda urbana:\nhttps://www.indy100.com/showbiz/rambo-iii-afghanistan-mujahideen-taliban-b1904082\n[#69](c69#c-69) Esos ojitos no han podido ver algo que jamás ha ocurrido:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_III#Dedication (apartado \"Dedication\")\nThe film ends with the on-screen caption, \"This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan.\" At some point after the September 11 attacks, an urban legend began that the dedication had actually read \"... to the brave Mujahideen fighters\" when the film was released in theaters, but then changed to \"the gallant people of Afghanistan\" after the 2001 attacks, since the Mujahideen were now associated to some extent with the Taliban. This urban legend has been repeated by some scholars. However, this is untrue, and some reviews of the film upon its release even mentioned the \"gallant people of Afghanistan\" dedication.\nEs decir, o bien crees haberlo visto (podría ser efecto Mandela) o bien simplemente estás mintiendo.\n[#71](c71#c-71) Pues entonces estás mintiendo. No hay ninguna versión de la película en la que aparezca dicho texto, y si te fijas la captura que se comparte online en la que sale el texto de los muyhidines siempre es la misma en el mismo frame exacto. Eso es debido a que la gente siempre comparte la misma captura editada.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Reagan murió hace 20 años y dejó la presidencia hace 35... De verdad tu argumento más solido es usar una foto de hace 40 años? Alguna prueba que adjuntar a la afirmación de la financiación de EEUU y UK a los culpables de este atentado?\nAcaso guarda alguna relación Reagan reuniéndose con los muyahidines hace 40 años con este atentado en Nigeria y yo no me he enterado?\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nEstos terroristas de Nigeria? Un pelín racista por tu parte hacer un batiburrillo basándote únicamente en que son integristas musulmanes.",

    "title": "Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew ‘Will Remarry,’ Sources Believe – DNyuz",
    "text": "Sarah Ferguson’s extraordinary re-acceptance into the heart of the royal family, walking to church with them on Christmas Day after a hiatus of more than 30 years, means the couple will get remarried “within a few years,” a friend of Prince Andrew has told The Daily Beast.\nThe friend, who has known Andrew for decades, principally through a shared love of shooting, told The Daily Beast: “It seems inevitable now that they will just formalize it within a few years and remarry. They live in the same house, they spend all their time together, they adore the children, they don’t ever argue.”\nA retired Buckingham Palace courtier told The Daily Beast: “The idea of remarriage has always been a running joke, but I think Fergie going to church has genuinely shifted the dial. If you think about it practically, what would need to happen? Andrew would need to ask his brother’s permission, and given his own romantic history, and the events of this week, you would have to guess he would agree.\n“It could never have happened when Prince Philip was alive. He ruled the family with a rod of iron and he loathed her. And Queen Elizabeth wouldn’t have gone against Philip’s wishes, even after his death. The simple fact is that if they wanted to remarry now, they could. Maybe they won’t do so immediately, but if you look a few years down the line I don’t think it’s an absurd suggestion anymore.”\nAsked if the couple, who still live in separate, self-contained wings of Andrew’s enormous mansion, Royal Lodge, still had a physical relationship, the friend said: “Not as far as we know, but nor do plenty of married couples in their sixties. But I wouldn’t be totally shocked if some corridor-creeping is going on.”\nAdding to the intrigue, a reporter at the London Times wrote Thursday that Sarah’s late father, Major Ronald Ferguson, once told him: “Those two never wanted to get divorced. It wasn’t them. It was that family.”\nSarah herself has made a similar claim, telling Harper’s Bazaar , that after she and Andrew separated, they only divorced because “it’s not right for a princess of the royal house to be commercial so Andrew and I decided to make the divorce official so I could go off and get a job.”\nSarah has never directly said she would like to remarry Andrew, but has done little to quash such speculation. (Her reps told The Daily Beast they would not comment, and Andrew’s reps did not reply to a request for comment.)\nFor example, when not invited to the coronation she told a British breakfast show, per Harper’s Bazaar : “It’s a state occasion, and being divorced I don’t think you can have it both ways. I am divorced and I’m really loving being divorced to my ex-husband; not from him but to him, it’s important to differentiate.”\nIn her 2011 autobiography, Finding Sarah , she wrote: “I love Andrew to this day, as I did when I met and married him, and I would never, ever, sell him out or betray him,” and as recently as this summer she said on her podcast Tea Talks with the Duchess and Sarah that marrying her “handsome prince” was the best day of her life.\nNone of the renewed speculation about the couple remarrying would be happening, of course, were it not for the decision to include Fergie on the Christmas walk.\nWhile this was obviously ultimately the decision of the king, the London Times has reported on speculation that Queen Camilla may have played a part in persuading her husband to offer the olive branch, and a palace insider credited the king and queen’s influence on him in comments to Page Six , saying: “Sarah has always been close to the king and is fond of him, and she has increasingly grown closer to the queen. She’s always been loyal to the family and has really not put a foot wrong in recent years. She’s never said a critical word and is always extremely loyal to the institution.”\nHe may also have been encouraged in his generosity by a reported gesture from the late Queen Elizabeth, who according to the Daily Mail , said Fergie could have her funeral at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle and be interred at the royal burial ground at Frogmore.\nBuckingham Palace did not respond to a request for comment on why the king had decided to include Sarah in the church appearance.\nSo could they remarry?\nAndrew Lownie, a historian and biographer who is publishing a biography of Andrew next year, told The Daily Beast he thought it was unlikely they would ever actually remarry because to do so would inhibit Fergie’s ability to continue working in the private sector, having most recently established herself as a successful romance author.\n“I don’t think she wants to get remarried to him. She’s very happy with the current arrangement where she has all the benefits of being in the royal family without any of the restrictions.”\n— Andrew Lownie\nHe said: “They have their own separate lives. There have been all sorts of boyfriends and girlfriends in the past, and I think there will continue to be so. There hasn’t been a sexual relationship there since Eugenie was born.\n“She has always spun this line that they were forced to divorce by the Men in Grey, but the reality is, she got bored sick of him and fell out of love with him. He remained in love with her, certainly for a while, after they separated, but she wanted out. I don’t think she wants to get remarried to him. She’s very happy with the current arrangement where she has all the benefits of being in the royal family without any of the restrictions.\n“She wants to keep in with the royal family because that’s what basically pays her rent. So why not go one step further and marry him? Because then she couldn’t do all the money-making.”\nLownie said he suspected that the inclusion of Fergie in the Christmas walk to church was co-ordinated for the benefit of the royals’ image, not hers.\n“I think this was just good news management. It was a very good story,” Lownie said. “It’s one big, happy family, and they’re now pushing that line of the one big happy family, which has been the trope since George V. This is a way of showing a little bit of Christian forgiveness and building bridges within the family. It costs absolutely nothing. No one has really criticized it. So it was a win-win situation for everyone.”\nOf course, hanging over all this is the prospect that Andrew’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein could once again be spotlit in the New Year when sealed court documents naming over 170 associates of Epstein are due to be unsealed .\n“No-one can really explain the relationship, other than saying they are clearly good friends. Even to those close to the family it’s an enigma.”\n— Duncan Larcombe\nAndrew is said to be “totally tormented” by the prospect. The documents were part of a defamation case brought against jailed Epstein conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre , the Epstein trafficking victim to whom Andrew paid an estimated $14 million settlement over claims of rape and sexual abuse.\nLownie says that while he suspects the new papers are unlikely to contain any bombshells, there is undoubtedly “more stuff” to come out on Andrew, and being seen as having the support of his ex-wife will be crucial to selling a narrative that although he went “off the rails” he has changed and now has the respect and love of his family.\nDuncan Larcombe, a royal biographer and former royal editor for the Sun , told the Daily Beast: “No-one can really explain the relationship, other than saying they are clearly good friends. Even to those close to the family it’s an enigma. They were originally supposed to be staying together for the sake of the children, but the children are grown up now. I honestly think if they were going to get remarried it would have happened by now. You could almost conclude that Fergie needs the association with royalty to ensure her commercial success.”\nThe post Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew ‘Will Remarry,’ Sources Believe appeared first on The Daily Beast .",
