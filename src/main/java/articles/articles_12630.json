    "text": "This is the dramatic moment bystanders lift a car in a desperate battle to save a 'Good Samaritan' who was run over as he helped a woman hurt in a violent wedding party row. Christian Marriott was on a post-Christmas walk with his wife and young children when a car ploughed into a group of people in Sheffield, killing him as he came to the stranger's aid. Shocking footage shows an ambulance worker and a group of neighbours trying to rescue victims of the ram attack from under the blue Seat. With arms outstretched, five people anxiously have their hands on the car as it rocks precariously. Others helplessly watch on and officers appear to be delivering first aid to people on the ground. The horrific scenes came after a wedding party turned into a 'bloodbath' as tensions escalated between warring families. Christian Marriott left his young children and was providing first aid to an injured woman when he was killed when in a car ram attack after a wedding party turned into a 'bloodbath' between warring families A muzzed image of the crash aftermath on a street in Pitsmoor in Sheffield, South Yorkshire Mr Marriott left his two sons, aged eight and six, to help the lady who was lying unconscious in the street just after 2pm. Police believe she had been involved in the altercation. He was then hit by the car - which also ploughed into the woman he was trying to save and a number of others. The violence, which allegedly included a stabbing, is said to have broken out after two families started arguing at the groom's semi-detached home following the ceremony at a local mosque. Six other people suffered injuries during the incident including an off-duty midwife, who had also stopped to help. Police said that of the other casualties, the off-duty midwife suffered minor injuries, a man suffered serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening and four further people - three women and a man - all suffered minor injuries. A man aged 23, arrested on suspicion of murder, and a second man, 55, arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, last night remained in custody. Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Andrew Knowles, paid tribute to the victim of a 'horrific tragedy', as he issued a plea for information regarding the incident. He said: 'This is an utterly heartbreaking case in which a Good Samaritan, who had stepped in to help a stranger in their time of need, has lost his life. 'Chris leaves behind a loving family including his devastated wife and two young sons. We are absolutely determined to secure justice for Chris and his loved ones following this horrific tragedy. Mr Marriott pictured with his wife Bryony Marriott A vehicle was seen being towed away from the scene after reports of a disturbance 'Increased patrols will continue in the area in the coming days and local people will continue to see officers carrying out enquiries, including going house-to-house to gather witness statements. 'There are people in that community who hold information which is vital to our investigation and have not yet given statements. 'I want to be able to get to the bottom of what happened for Chris and his family. I need those people with information to do the right thing. If you don't want to talk to us directly, you can use Crimestoppers and remain 100 per cent anonymous.' Further footage showed the panic moments after the attack, with neighbours screaming as they try to find out what has happened. One man can be seen screaming and pointing as an officer pushes them away from the tragic scene as locals - some in their pajamas - have left their houses to see if they can help. In the moments after the horrific incident, well-meaning bystanders gather around the car alongside emergency service officers as they rush to help the victims. Describing himself as 'a general all-rounder who loves leading and coaching', Mr Marriott had devoted his time to a series of charities and voluntary causes before his death. Mr Marriott left his two sons, aged eight and six, to help the lady, who was lying unconscious in the street just after 2pm. Police believe she had been involved in the altercation. Pictured: Forensic officers near to the scene Two men arrested in connection with the incident - one on suspicion of murder - remain in custody, the force said. Pictured: Forensic officers near to the scene An experienced finance, operations and project manager he turned his talents to specialised roles to help the community. He had held long-term roles as part of a monetary advice charity, at Sheffield's Museums and within the local church. Within the Voluntary Action Sheffield charity, he lead their Healthy Holidays programme, bringing a range of activities and food to children across the summer. Speaking about his efforts - which included delivering around 3,500 healthy food hampers in just one week - he said: 'It has stretched and challenged me beyond my comfort zone on so many occasions. 'But seeing photos of kids getting outside, having fun and cooking at home has reminded, once again, that investing time and effort into the lives of children and young people is so worth it.' Shocked Shazia Bi described the horror after her brother-in-law Riasat Khan - the groom's father - was mowed down by the speeding car which killed Mr Marriott. The mother-of-five said a row had erupted after Mr Khan's son Hasan Khan, in his early 20's, had married his 19-year-old girlfriend Amani at a mosque near their homes in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, yesterday. The violence, which allegedly included a stabbing, is said to have broken out yesterday afternoon following a row between the families of a woman and her partner. Mrs Bi, who lives next door but one to the Khans in a quiet street in the city's Burngreave suburb, said: 'It was a happy occasion but it turned into a bloodbath. It was shocking. The scene in College Close, Burngreave, Sheffield as the police cordon remains in place 'An innocent man who wasn't a member of either family but had been trying to help and calm the situation sadly lost his life. 'My brother-in-law was hit by the car and was taken to hospital with head injuries but thankfully is OK, just a bit hurt and very shocked.' Mrs Bi, speaking as police launched a murder investigation, said the two families had started arguing after the ceremony at the groom's semi-detached home. She told MailOnline: 'The bride, the girl, was happy and everything was peaceful but there was a problem with her family who live a few miles away. 'I think they had been invited to the wedding but chose not to attend but later went to the boy's home to confront his family. 'It was her family making all the drama. They didn't want the girl to marry the boy. 'They were not happy that the wedding had gone so ahead and a big argument started outside the house. There were lots of people in the street.' Mrs Bi, who had not attended the wedding because she was busy looking after her young baby and other children, added: 'One of the girl's relatives had driven into the crowds. I didn't see it and do not know if it was deliberate or accidental. 'My brother-in-law got hit but not seriously. His head was bleeding and he went to hospital but is now out. 'He and the husband's family are not allowed home for a few days because police have it sealed off as a crime scene. 'We don't know the name of the man who died - he is not one of our family but I think he lives in the street or was visiting someone there.' The groom is one of five siblings, aged 22 to seven.

'The people fighting were all men. When I went outside, everything seemed to have happened with the car. There was a guy and a woman who seemed to be injured and there were people under the car. I don't know if one or two. 'Another man had blood coming from his face. It was 2-3 minutes before the police came.'
