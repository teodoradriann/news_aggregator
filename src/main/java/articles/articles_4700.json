    "title": "Les ingénieurs du Québec déclencheront une grève illimitée le 2 mai",
    "text": "D’ici là, ils poursuivent la grève de soir, de nuit et de fin de semaine qu’ils ont déjà amorcée, a indiqué en entrevue, vendredi, Marc-André Martin, président de l’Association professionnelle des ingénieurs du gouvernement du Québec (APIGQ).\nCes ingénieurs travaillent aux ministères des Transports — 1200 d’entre eux — de l’Environnement, des Ressources naturelles, par exemple. Ils délivrent des permis et s’occupent de la planification de chantiers.\nLe président de l’APIGQ maintient que Québec n’offre pas véritablement aux ingénieurs du gouvernement la même «enveloppe budgétaire» que celle qu’il a accordée à l’ensemble des employés de l’État.\nLa présidente du Conseil du trésor, Sonia LeBel, assure que le gouvernement a bel et bien offert aux ingénieurs des augmentations de salaire de l’ordre de 17,4 % sur cinq ans, comme ce qui a été accordé aux autres employés de l’État.\n«Une proposition globale de règlement, incluant le +17,4 % tel que convenu avec 98 % des autres syndicats publics, a été déposée le 8 janvier 2025», a indiqué la ministre.\nM. Martin rétorque qu’en plus des augmentations salariales de 17,4 %, les employés de l’État ont obtenu un autre montant, qui équivaut selon lui à 7 ou 8 %, pour les assurances, des congés, des primes et autres – ce qui n’a pas été offert aux ingénieurs.\nIl rapporte donc que ses membres «ont le sentiment que le gouvernement s’obstine à nous donner moins que les autres».\n«Ce qu’on demande, nous, c’est ni plus ni moins la même chose que les autres, pas plus, pas moins. On veut avoir accès à ces mêmes enveloppes-là», insiste le dirigeant syndical.\n«Nous, on n’est pas pressé de signer un mauvais règlement. Hier, on a eu une assemblée; les gens sont derrière nous. On leur a dit: écoutez, c’est pas vrai qu’on va laisser de l’argent sur la table; c’est pas vrai qu’on va signer en bas des autres groupes», a rapporté M. Martin.\nLe mandat de grève a été appuyé à 87,9 %, avec un taux de participation de 85,5 %, souligne-t-il.\nIl reste donc un mois aux parties pour s’entendre sur le renouvellement de la convention collective avant l’extension de la grève.\nVendredi matin, aucune autre séance de négociation n’était prévue. Mais M. Martin se dit prêt à négocier n’importe quand. «Nos téléphones sont ouverts.»\nMercredi dernier, soit avant que l’avis de grève soit transmis, la ministre LeBel écrivait sur X: «négos avec les ingénieurs: avec les chantiers qui s’en viennent au Québec, on peut régler rapidement avec l’APIGQ».\nDans le cas d’une grève des ingénieurs, des services essentiels sont prévus, afin d’assurer la santé et la sécurité du public. M. Martin précise que 350 ingénieurs y sont affectés.",

The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Jason Hopkins\nDaily Caller News Foundation\nAmid a wave of illegal immigration and high-profile crime incidents, a bipartisan group of New York City council members introduced legislation Thursday to roll back the city’s sanctuary policies.\nThe bill, introduced by New York City Council’s Common Sense Caucus, would repeal laws that limit New York City law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),\naccording to the text of legislation. It would also roll back a law that bars city officials from partnering with ICE agents to enforce federal immigration law and prohibitions on the use of city resources to assist deportation officers. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\nMembers of the Common Sense Caucus —which is made up of both Republicans and Democrats — said in a press release that repeal of the city’s sanctuary laws would “enhance” law enforcement’s ability to ensure safety and security.\n“We have enough criminals in this city; we don’t need to import more and protect them as well,” Council Member Robert Holden, a Democrat, said in a press statement. “Repealing the laws that have created a sanctuary city status is common sense.”\n“Those who are wanted for heinous crimes back home or commit crimes in our country should be deported without hesitation,” he continued. “We aim to end this reckless social experiment once and for all.”\nThe bill takes specific aim at repealing laws enacted under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, an ardent critic of federal immigration enforcement. De Blasio in 2014\nsigned into law a bill that largely prohibits the New York Police Department from working with federal immigration authorities, and in 2018 he enacted legislation that reinforced on this policy.\nHowever, as record numbers of illegal immigrants flock to the city and high-profile crimes committed by migrants make headlines, city leaders have begun to shift on the issue.\nMore than 200,000 migrants have overwhelmed New York City since 2022,\nhttps://www.nysun.com/article/new-york-city-bill-aims-to-repeal-sanctuary-status-as-migrant-arrivals-surpass-200000 local reports. The migrant influx prompted Mayor Eric Adams to declare 5% budget cuts in September for government programs and services in order to pay for their housing and other services, and in August he said the city was reaching a “breaking point” from the sheer volume of migrants.\nThe city’s sanctuary status entered the spotlight again when it\nwas confirmed that Bernardo Raul Castro Mata, a 19-year-old man from Venezuela accused of shooting two New York City Police Department cops on Monday, entered the country illegally.\n“Every one of our so-called sanctuary city laws should be repealed and it is time we make that case directly to the people,” Minority Whip Inna Vernikov, a Republican, said in a statement. “Happy to see this legislation introduced, it has my full support and advocacy and I encourage all New Yorkers who want citizenship to mean something again in this city and country to call their representative to support this repeal.”\nCouncil Member Salman Yeger, another Democrat, was also unequivocal in his support for the bill: “Giving no-questions-asked sanctuary to criminals is not a pro-immigrant policy; it is a pro-criminal policy,” he said Thursday.\nIt’s not immediately clear how the bill will fare in a city council dominated by liberal Democrats. In response to a\nlocal media inquiry, Mayor Adams said he would review the legislation before taking an official position.\nHowever, there does appear to be a shift within the mayor’s office. ICE officials\nconfirmed last month that Adams’ office had been in talks with federal immigration authorities on how to better coordinate their efforts and work around the city’s sanctuary laws.\n“I’ve been working with the mayor’s office, I have had dialogue with them,” Ken Genalo, the NYC regional field director for ICE, said of the talks. “I give them kudos — the prior administration under Mr. de Blasio … there was no dialogue at all.”\nAdams’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available protection).
