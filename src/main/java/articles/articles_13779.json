    "title": "13-hour rescue: Family of kittens pulled from storm drain in 108-degree heat",
    "text": "LAS VEGAS ( KVVU /Gray News) - A Las Vegas family spent 13 hours in triple-digit heat to rescue kittens and their mother from a storm drain. And after the hourslong ordeal, they were able to reunite the mother cat with her babies. The situation happened near a neighborhood park in the northwest part of town this week. Dana Hernandez said her daughter and husband were on an early morning walk when they heard crying coming from a storm drain. “They saw the mama cat jump into the sewer. That caught my child’s attention, and my husband came over and saw the kittens,” she said. Hernandez and her mother, Julie Woodward, said they called Las Vegas Animal Control several times, as well as the police department and the fire department. As temperatures soared to 108 degrees Fahrenheit, the family members said they yanked off the storm drain to drop down water and food for the kittens and the mother. “The mommy was very emaciated. We gave her two cans of food and she ate all of it. She was starving,” Woodward said. Hernandez managed to crawl down the storm drain and pull out several of the kittens. The family took them to an emergency veterinarian, who said they were dehydrated and malnourished. Animal control arrived that afternoon and with a small trap, they tried to retrieve the other cats still inside the drain. Volunteers also stepped in to help and were able to pull out the additional kittens, but then the mother cat could not be found. Late Friday night, Animal control officers dropped off another trap to help find the mother. “They were probably in there for a couple of days. They’re very, very small,” Woodward said. The family didn’t give up their efforts, either, and during the overnight hours, their mission was complete by locating the mother cat and reuniting her with her five kittens. “She was very scared, but she is safe with all five of her kittens rescued. The babies cried all night long, but when we added momma into the room with them, they all stopped and started nursing,” Hernandez said. The family said they plan to adopt all of the kittens.

    "text": "How to watch LSU gymnastics open NCAA regional in Fayetteville on Thursday night The LSU gymnastics team has clinched a postseason berth for the 39th consecutive season, and it's heading to Arkansas as the No. 2 national seed and the top seed in the Fayetteville Region. LSU (19-3, 5-2 SEC) has a National Qualifying Score of 198.215, the highest in program history, as it seeks to punch its ticket to the NCAA championships in Fort Worth. The Tigers begin their postseason run in the Thursday evening session, where they're joined by No. 15 Minnesota, No. 18 Oregon State and BYU. “There’s no such thing as an easy regional. We’ll see some familiar SEC faces and we know that it’ll be a great environment, but regardless of where we go, we have a job to do” coach Jay Clark said in a release. “It’s just about us staying on our same message, and that’s focusing on the five minutes in front of our face and not getting too ahead of ourselves. We just have to go out there and be normal. If we can do that, then we’re pretty confident in the results.” The regional round runs through Saturday and the NCAA championships will be from April 18-20. Here's what you need to know to watch LSU's opening session at the Fayetteville Regional on Thursday night.

    "text": "At a press conference at the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, President Joe Biden reiterated his commitment to staying in the 2024 presidential race, telling reporters he still believes he is the best-qualified Democratic candidate. Scripps News' Haley Bull asked the president: If delegates to the Democratic National Convention have second thoughts about supporting President Biden as the candidate, are they free to vote their conscience? \"Obviously they're free to do whatever they want,\" President Biden said. \"But I get overwhelming support. I forget how many votes I won in the primary. Overwhelming.\" \"If I show up at the convention and everybody says, 'We want somebody else,' that's the democratic process,\" he said. But, he added, \"That's not going to happen.\" Even if that means they vote for someone else? \"The truth of the matter is I understand the self-interest of every candidate. If they think that running Biden at the top of the ticket's going to hurt them, then they're going to run away. I get it. But so far — go and look at the polling data in their states,\" President Biden said. \"How accurate does anybody think the polls are these days? I can give you a series of polls where you have likely voters, me vs. Trump, where I win all the time. When the unlikely voters vote, he wins sometimes. Bottom line is all the polling data right now — I think is premature because the campaign really hasn't started in earnest yet.\" \"A lot can happen,\" President Biden said. \"But I believe I'm the best qualified to govern. And I think I'm the best qualified to win. There are other people who could beat Trump too, but it's awful hard to start from scratch.\" RELATED STORY | [President Biden holds wide-ranging press conference at NATO summit](https://www.scrippsnews.com/Politics/america-votes/biden-to-hold-first-press-conference-since-lackluster-debate-performance) The president said those difficulties would extend to his current vice president, Kamala Harris. Scripps News asked: You expressed confidence in your vice president, Kamala Harris. If your team showed you data that she would fare better against former President Donald Trump, would you reconsider your decision to stay in the race? \"No, unless they came back and said 'There's no way you could win,'\" President Biden said. \"No one's saying that.\"",

    "text": "Programa estadual distribuiu à Capital 2,1 mil kits com os itens Gestantes em situação de vulnerabilidade social atendidas pelas unidades de saúde da Capital recebem, a partir desta quinta-feira, 4, um kit de itens essenciais para os primeiros dias de vida do bebê. A entrega é possível por meio do programa Mãe Gaúcha, do governo estadual. A solenidade ocorreu no Centro Logístico da Casa Militar e contou com a presença dos secretários municipais de Saúde, Fernando Ritter, e adjunto do Desenvolvimento Social, Nelson Beron, pastas responsáveis pela logística de distribuição em Porto Alegre. A primeira a receber o kit foi a gestante, hoje com 28 semanas, Fabiana Aires Fernandes da Silva, atendida na Unidade de Saúde Mapa. \"Aquela bolsa, para muitos, é só uma bolsa. Mas para nós, mães de baixa renda, é de grande valor, porque a gente sabe que nossos filhos vão sair da maternidade aquecidos e muitos não têm essa oportunidade\", agradeceu ela, que ainda está decidindo se o nome da sua bebê será Vitória ou Sofia. O programa estadual distribuiu à Capital 2,1 mil kits com os itens que buscam atender as gestantes. Atualmente, as unidades de saúde têm 2.664 gestantes nos critérios do programa e o benefício irá auxiliar como incentivo na adesão ao pré-natal. Cada kit do enxoval é composto por um cobertor, toalha de banho com capuz, casaquinho de moletom, macacões longos e curtos, bodies, culotes, meias, além de uma bolsa maternidade. \"É importante promovermos o acolhimento e bem-estar, trazendo mais conforto para os bebês e tranquilidade para as mães atendidas nas nossas unidades de saúde\", frisou Ritter. \"Que a gente possa, cada vez mais, trabalhar com o olhar para a infância e para o desenvolvimento social dessa forma tão humana como está sendo olhada, seja na Lomba de Pinheiro, no Morro da Cruz e no Partenon\", complementou Beron. O Mãe Gaúcha contempla gestantes a partir da 28ª semana de gravidez que residem nos municípios que aderirem ao edital, como é o caso de Porto Alegre. As mamães precisam estar com o pré-natal em dia, ser inscritas no Cadastro Único e receber o benefício do Bolsa Família ou estar aguardando o deferimento da inscrição no programa. Para o enfermeiro da US Mapa, Carlos Silva, para além da iniciativa fortalecer os vínculos entre mãe e filho, a entrega das bolsas incentiva que as gestantes sigam a realização de um pré-natal com cuidado à prevenção e desenvolvimento saudável do bebê. *Com a informação PMPA",

    "text": "US-bound Air India flight grounded in Vienna after issue detected during fuel stop\nRoutine checks during a planned Vienna fuel stop forced Air India's Delhi-Washington flight to stay grounded, leaving passengers stranded.\nIn Short\n- Another Air India Dreamliner plane suffered technical glitch in Vienna\n- Passengers safely deboarded, hotel stay arranged for those eligible\n- Return flight from Washington to New Delhi cancelled, refund issued\nAn Air India flight operating on the Delhi to Washington, DC route was grounded in Vienna on Wednesday after a routine inspection during a scheduled refuelling stop flagged an extended maintenance issue.\nFlight AI103, which departed from Delhi on July 2, landed in Vienna as part of a planned fuel halt. According to an Air India spokesperson, routine checks during the stopover revealed an issue that required additional maintenance work, forcing the airline to cancel the onward leg to Washington.\n\"As a result, passengers were disembarked in Vienna. Those eligible for visa-free entry or holding valid Schengen visas were provided hotel accommodation until the next available flight. For passengers without entry permission, arrangements are being made in coordination with Austrian immigration and security authorities,\" an Air India spokesperson said.\nThe disruption also impacted the return service — Flight AI104 from Washington to Delhi via Vienna — which was subsequently cancelled. Air India said affected passengers have been rebooked on alternative flights or offered full refunds.\nThe flight was a Boeing Dreamliner, a passenger jet that is in focus around the world following the crash of Air India Flight 171 in Ahmedabad, which killed over 270 people.\nAir India and its low-cost arm Air India Express together operate more than 1,100 flights daily, carrying over 1,50,000 passengers. The airline asserted that it has stepped up pre-flight safety checks and temporarily reduced some services to ensure operational stability and minimise last-minute disruptions.\nThe Tata Group-owned airline has come under intense scrutiny following the Ahmedabad crash and a series of mid-air technical glitches on other routes. In response, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered comprehensive inspections of all Dreamliners equipped with GenX engines. The safety audit covers critical components such as fuel parameter monitoring systems, cabin air compressors, engine control systems, and more.\nThe airline has warned of delays due to the inspection and said that \"some of these checks could lead to higher turnaround time and potential delays on certain long-haul routes\". The airline added that customers will be duly notified about any delays and advised them to check flight status before heading to the airport.",
