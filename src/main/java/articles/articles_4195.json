The Black Caps went into the match needing to win the game to draw the three match series, while Bangladesh were chasing their first T20 series win in New Zealand. New Zealand skipper Mitch Santner won the toss and opted to bowl and the wickets soon began began tumbling as the Bangladesh batters struggled to post a seemingly competitive total. Skipper Najmul Shanto with 17 top scored, as the tourists limped through to 110 all out. Santner was the most successful of the Black Caps bowlers taking 4-16, while Ben Sears, Tim Southee and Adam Milne took two wickets apiece. While the 111 run target appeared meager, New Zealand made hard work of the run chase slumping to 38 for four. When Finn Allen went for 38 the Black Caps were 49 for five. Jimmy Neesham and Santer then teamed up to steady the ship putting on an unbeaten stand of 46 for the sixth wicket before the rain, thunder and lightening arrived forcing the players off and with New Zealand 95-5 in the 15th over. That total had New Zealand ahead under DLS with the par score being 78, giving the home side a 17 run victory, when the umpires eventually called the game off, leaving the series drawn at 1-all. Game two on Friday night at Bay Oval was washed out.",

    "title": "B.C. civil lawsuit against Sex Pistols guitarist alleges 1980 sexual assault",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — A Vancouver woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. and punk rocker Stephen Jones of The Sex Pistols alleging he sexually assaulted her as a teenager while she was a movie extra more than 40 years ago.\nA B.C. Supreme Court statement of claim filed by the plaintiff says she was 14 years old and working on the movie \"Ladies & Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains\" when Jones supplied her with marijuana, then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room.\nThe court has placed a publication ban on the woman's name.\nHer lawyer Jason Gratl said in an interview that he could not comment about why the lawsuit was brought 44 years after the alleged events.\n\"I only wanted to say one thing and it's that she kept a diary,\" Gratl said.\nThe notice of claim filed Wednesday says Paramount didn't take adequate steps to warn minors or their parents about the risks of working on the set with Jonesor impose contractual terms restricting his contact with young extras or using illicit drugs.\nNone of the allegations have been tested in court.\nParamount did not immediately return a request for comment. Jones could not be reached for comment.\nNeither Paramount, nor Jones have filed a statement of defence.\nThe lawsuit says Paramount hired Jones, who was 24 at the time, for a role in the film because of his reputation as a \"punk rocker\" who consumed excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and engaged in sexual misconduct, including with underage girls.\n\"The defendant Paramount was banking on the defendant Jones’ reputation and history to market 'The Fabulous Stains,'\" the statement says, adding the company \"also hired other well-known punk rock musicians as actors for the same purpose.\"\nThe statement says that despite this knowledge, the company did not take steps to protect young workers.\nThe movie, about disaffected teens in a punk rock band, was released in 1982.\nThe legal action says the woman is seeking damages, claiming the alleged assault \"caused her to suffer psychological injury, including loss of self-esteem, loss of self-worth, injurious self-imaging and identity, and loss of trust in intimacy and potential partners.\"\nThe lawsuit says she was hired as one of the hundreds of extras playing fans for the all-girl feminist rock band. Jones had been hired to play the role of a \"socially volatile punk rock guitar player in a fictitious all-male band, The Looters.\"\nIt says that on April 13, 1980, the teen went to the Denman Inn, \"a location under the direction and control\" of Paramount, with the intention of inviting the movie's lead actor, Diane Lane, to go roller skating.\nWhen she entered the lobby, it says Jones approached her, told her he had Lane's number in his hotel room and asked her to go with him to get it. Once they were inside his room, it says Jones gave her marijuana, and he then turned off the lights and closed the curtains.\nThe document says she understood that meant he was likely to make sexual advances, she told Jones she did not consent and was \"only 14, 1-4.\" It says despite this, he pulled her onto his bed, climbed on top of her then kissed and molested her.\n\"The plaintiff repeatedly and expressly told the defendant Jones 'no' and tried to move his hand away, and finally wriggled free from him and left the room,\" the notice of claim says.\nThe lawsuit says she was initially \"both repulsed and flattered by this unwanted sexual attention from someone she believed to be a rock star and movie star.\"\nBecause she was confused by what had happened, the document says she did not tell her parents and it wasn't until she was older that she \"felt sexually violated and sexually ashamed and angry\" about the alleged assault.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "An aide to President Biden claimed that the president has actually &quot;done a lot&quot; to help lower prices. NY Post composite / istock/ Gett Diary of disturbing disinformation and dangerous delusions This claim: “President Biden has done a lot to lower prices.” — Biden campaign spokesman Adrienne Elrod, Monday We say: Seriously? Can Elrod name a single thing cheaper today than when Biden took office? Meat’s up a whopping 30%. Eggs, 40%. Gasoline, nearly 50%. Americans have lost an average 3.9% in inflation-adjusted income. Biden didn’t lower prices but instead flooded an already-heated economy with trillions in new spending that sent prices soaring. Elrod’s spin won’t fool anyone who visits a grocery store. This praise: “When European heads of state look at Joe Biden, they see an accomplished world-historic leader.” — Washington Monthly editor-in-chief Paul Glastris, Sunday We say: This guy clearly drank the Kool-Aid. Following Biden’s disastrous bugout from Afghanistan, Russia invaded Ukraine, Hamas ignited a war in Gaza, China has threatened Taiwan and the Philippines and Iran is thisclose to having nukes. Does Glastris think European heads of state haven’t noticed? Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates had it right when he said Biden’s “been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.” This non-response: “I’ve said what I’m going to say.” — Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Thursday We say: Asked if crimes by illegal immigrants let in on Biden’s watch are preventable, Nadler refused to answer. Why? Because of course they are. These criminals could’ve and should’ve been turned away at the border. Nadler had earlier claimed the “crime rate among immigrants” is lower than among native-born Americans. Even if that was true in the past, today illegal migrants are let in en masse from the world over and set loose with virtually no screening. What does Nadler think that leads to? This boast: “We’ve already created 15 million new jobs — a record.” — President Biden, June 18 We say: Biden’s record on the economy is so bleak, all he can do is forever repeat the same lie about job creation. US jobs are actually up by just 6.2 million since before the pandemic, not 15 million. The other jobs Biden takes credit for are merely those revived after being shuttered by Dem-beloved COVID lockdowns. Compiled by The Post Editorial Board",

    "title": "Artificial dyes to be phased out of food products",
    "text": "Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Tuesday a ban on artificial dyes in the country’s food supply.\nThe FDA banned Red Dye 3 in January, and the new ban targets six other synthetic dyes and two food colorings.\nThe ingredients are found in processed foods like candies, cereals, drinks and even some medicine.\nKennedy claims the dyes are responsible for behavioral issues in children, though the FDA in 2011 and 2019 determined no relationship between the two could be established.\n“On one level, it makes sense to ban them because they’re artificial, they don’t have any nutritional value. However, the evidence to show that they are harmful for human consumption is very scant,” Dr. Andrew Wong of Hartford HealthCare said.\n“The food products that they’re in are processed foods, so banning them isn’t a bad thing. Avoiding processed foods in general is a good thing, and replacing those dyes with natural substances like carrot juice, watermelon juice and beet juice may be a good move, but there just isn’t a lot of evidence to show that these dyes are indeed harmful,” he continued.\nDoctors said the dyes are in processed foods that should be avoided anyway, especially for children.\n“Like anything else, it’s not necessarily getting in a little bit that’s harmful. It’s really more, are our children consuming Cheetos every day? Are we drinking high sugar content and artificial drinks every day? That’s what we really need to avoid is having a diet based on processed foods,” Wong said.\n“Having a diet based on artificial ingredients…parents want to avoid doing that because in the long term, I can certainly see a correlation with poor diet and poor developmental growth,” he continued.\nNBC Connecticut spoke to consumers about the issue, and they agree that the dyes should be removed.\n“The more natural our food is, the better,” Nick Dellaera, of Burlington, said.\n“Health is wealth, and if we don’t have our health, we have nothing,” Paulette Bowman, of Windsor, said.\nThe change authorizes four new natural color additives. The head of the FDA suggested using beet or carrot juice, and said the ban won’t raise the cost of food.\n“The transition from petroleum-based food dyes to natural ingredient food dyes, will not increase food prices. We know that from other countries that have already made the transition,” Marty Makary, FDA commissioner, said.",
