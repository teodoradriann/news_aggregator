Therefore, I’m on par punning and penning Parkites' pastimes. Turning high and early through my career, I’ve worked communications for The Olympics, the Paralympics and the Special Olympics.

    "text": "Several U.S. lawmakers, including three prominent Indian-American Congressmen, have strongly condemned the vandalism of a Hindu temple in California and asserted that those responsible for the act must be held accountable.\nThe Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple in Newark, California was vandalised with anti-India graffiti and the police are investigating the matter as a possible hate crime.\nCongressman Ro Khanna, who represents California's 17th Congressional District located in Silicon Valley, said in a post on X that he strongly condemns the “defacing” of the Swaminarayan temple in Newark, California which is in his district.\n“Freedom to worship is at the heart of American democracy. Those who committed this act of vandalism must be held accountable,” Mr. Khanna said.\nHe said he is heartened that the community is coming together to stand up against hate and remove the graffiti. “This community action is answering wickedness with goodness,” he said.\nALSO READ Extremist, separatist forces outside India should not get space: Jaishankar on U.S. temple vandalism Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi termed the defacing of the Swaminarayan temple as “despicable” and said he strongly condemns it.\nMr. Krishnamoorthi, the U.S. representative for Illinois's 8th congressional district, said he is glad the community is rallying in support of the mandir.\n“We must stand united against bigotry in all its ugly forms. Those who did this vandalism must be held accountable,” he said.\nCongressman Shri Thanedar also expressed his profound condemnation of the \"disgraceful act of vandalism\".\n\"This desecration, marked by anti-India graffiti, strikes at the very essence of our diverse and inclusive society. I denounce such attacks of intolerance and call for a thorough investigation into this heinous crime,\" Mr. Thanedar, the U.S. representative from Michigan's 13th congressional district, said.\n\"Religious freedom and communal harmony are fundamental tenets of our nation, and I urge swift action by law enforcement to bring the perpetrators to justice, ensuring the safety and sanctity of all places of worship,\" he added.\nCongresswoman Barbara Lee from California “unequivocally” condemned the attack. “Hatred in all forms cannot be tolerated. Those responsible must be held accountable,” she said.\nState Senator in the Ohio Senate Niraj Antani, elected to the Ohio Senate at age 29 and the youngest currently serving member of the Senate, said that as the first Hindu-American State Senator in Ohio history, he condemns in the \"strongest terms” the vandalisation of the Hindu Mandir.\n“The perpetrators must be caught and punished to the full extent of the law. We must root out and vanquish Hinduphobia everywhere it is,” Mr. Antani said.\nThe U.S. State Department on Saturday also condemned the vandalism at the temple and welcomed efforts by the police to ensure those responsible are held accountable.\n\"We condemn the vandalism of Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple in California. We welcome efforts by the Newark Police Department to ensure that those responsible are held accountable,\" the U.S. State Department's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said in a post on X Saturday.\nThe City of Newark Police Department in Newark, Newark, California had told PTI in an emailed statement that on Friday at approximately 8:35 a.m., Newark Police received a report of graffiti at the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple.\nOfficers responded and met with temple leaders who described the vandalism as meant to intimidate them.\n“Based on the content of the graffiti it is believed that the defacement was a targeted act, and the vandalism is being investigated as a possible hate crime,” the statement said.\nThe Consulate General of India in San Francisco strongly condemned the defacing of the temple.\n“We strongly condemn the defacing of SMVS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir at Newark, California with anti-India graffiti,” the Consulate posted on X.\n“This incident has hurt the sentiments of the Indian community. We have pressed for quick investigation and prompt action against the vandals by the US authorities in this matter,” the Consulate said.\nAccording to images posted on social media, the word ‘Khalistan’ was spray-painted on a signpost outside the temple along with other objectionable graffiti.\nNewark police further said that any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority.\n“Officers are investigating, collecting evidence, and reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses to establish the chain of events and bring those responsible to justice,” the police said.\nThe department said that “we stand united with our community and are urging community members with any information regarding this incident to come forward and speak with investigators.”\nThe police are asking anyone with information regarding this investigation to contact the Newark Police Investigations Unit.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "title": "Musk's Misleading Election Posts Viewed 1.2 Billion Times: Study | IBTimes",
    "text": "False or misleading US election claims posted on X by Elon Musk have amassed nearly 1.2 billion views this year, a watchdog reported Thursday, highlighting the billionaire's potential influence on the highly polarized White House race.Ahead of the November election, researchers have raised alarm that X, formerly Twitter, is a hotbed of political misinformation.They have also flagged that Musk, who purchased the platform in 2022 and is a vocal backer of Donald Trump, appears to be swaying voters by spreading falsehoods on his personal account.Researchers from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) identified 50 posts since January by Musk -- who has more than 193 million followers on the social media site -- with election claims debunked by independent fact-checkers.None of the posts displayed a \"Community Note,\" a crowd-sourced moderation tool that X has promoted as the way for users to add context to posts, CCDH said, raising questions about its effectiveness to combat falsehoods.\"Elon Musk is abusing his privileged position as owner of a... politically influential social media platform to sow disinformation that generates discord and distrust,\" warned CCDH chief executive Imran Ahmed.\"The lack of Community Notes on these posts shows that his business is failing woefully to contain the kind of algorithmically-boosted incitement that we all know can lead to real-world violence.\"The posts analyzed by CCDH carried widely debunked claims, such as that Democrats are encouraging illegal migration with the aim of \"importing voters\" or that the election is vulnerable to fraud. Both claims amassed hundreds of millions of views.Last week, Musk faced a firehose of criticism for sharing with his followers an AI deepfake video featuring Trump's Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.In it, a voiceover mimicking Harris calls President Joe Biden senile before declaring that she does not \"know the first thing about running the country.\"The video, viewed by millions, carried no indication that it was parody -- save for a laughing emoji. Only later did Musk clarify that the video was meant as satire.\"Musk behaves as if he is beyond reproach despite growing evidence of the harmful role he is personally playing to fuel disinformation and division ahead of the US elections,\" Nora Benavidez, from the advocacy group Free Press Action Fund, told AFP.\"As his behavior edges closer to election interference, it's up to others -- the public, regulatory agencies and advertisers -- to hold him accountable for his anti-democratic behavior.\"Musk, who purchased the platform in 2022 for $44 billion, is facing growing scrutiny over his potential influence on voters.On Monday, a bipartisan group of five US secretaries of state sent an open letter to Musk, urging him to fix X's AI chatbot known as Grok after it produced election misinformation.Hours after Biden stepped down from the presidential race last month and endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee, Grok churned out false information about ballot deadlines, which was amplified by other platforms.X -- which also faced criticism for stoking tensions during recent far-right riots across England -- has gutted trust and safety teams and scaled back content moderation efforts once used to tame misinformation, making it what researchers call a haven for disinformation.X did not respond to an AFP request for comment.© Copyright AFP 2024.

    "title": "Sensor de oxígeno del coche: Posibles fallos y averías",
    "text": "Las partes internas de los vehículos modernos están diseñadas para ser más eficientes y menos contaminantes. Entre estos componentes destaca el sensor de oxígeno del coche, encargado de regular las emisiones y optimizar el consumo de combustible.\nEste dispositivo, pequeño y discreto, resulta vital para el funcionamiento del motor. Detecta cuánto oxígeno queda en los gases expulsados durante la combustión y, a partir de esa lectura, permite ajustar la mezcla aire-combustible para mejorar la eficiencia. Saber cómo funciona y qué señales da cuando empieza a fallar puede ahorrarte muchas averías.\n¿Qué es el sensor de oxígeno y cómo funciona?\nSe trata de un componente ubicado en el sistema de escape del coche, cuya función es informar a la centralita electrónica (ECU) sobre la cantidad de oxígeno presente en los gases quemados. Con esos datos, la ECU regula la cantidad de combustible que debe inyectarse al motor.\nLos vehículos suelen incorporar dos sensores: uno antes del catalizador y otro después. El primero ajusta la mezcla de aire y gasolina, mientras que el segundo verifica si el catalizador trabaja correctamente.\nHay sensores de banda estrecha y de banda ancha. Estos últimos son más precisos, ya que incorporan una celda que mide y controla de forma más exacta el oxígeno residual.\nEfectos de una mezcla aire-combustible incorrecta\nEl motor necesita una proporción equilibrada de aire y gasolina para funcionar bien. Cuando la mezcla es rica (demasiado carburante), el sensor detecta poco oxígeno y la ECU reduce el flujo de combustible. Si la mezcla es pobre (exceso de aire), la centralita inyecta más gasolina.\nUna mezcla desequilibrada puede aumentar notablemente las emisiones contaminantes. Si hay exceso de gasolina, se genera monóxido de carbono y otros hidrocarburos. Si hay poco, aumentan los óxidos de nitrógeno. Por eso, el sensor de oxígeno resulta clave para proteger el medio ambiente.\n¿Por qué puede fallar un sensor de oxígeno?\nEl desgaste es una de las causas más comunes. Este componente está expuesto a altas temperaturas, restos de combustible sin quemar, aceite contaminado o incluso refrigerante, lo que puede ir deteriorando su funcionamiento.\nUn sensor sucio o dañado envía señales erróneas a la centralita, lo que puede provocar problemas en la combustión, tirones y pérdida de potencia.\nSíntomas de fallo en el sensor de oxígeno\nCuando el sensor de oxígeno presenta fallos, pueden aparecer varios síntomas:\n- Se enciende el\ntestigo de avería motor(check engine). - Aumenta el consumo de combustible.\n- El motor da tirones o tiene un ralentí inestable.\n- Dificultad al arrancar.\n- Pérdida de fuerza al acelerar.\nConducir en estas condiciones puede dañar otros elementos del sistema de escape, como el catalizador, e incrementar el gasto en reparaciones.\nCómo se diagnostica y sustituye\nEl diagnóstico se realiza mediante un escáner OBD, que se conecta al vehículo y permite leer los errores almacenados por la centralita. Si se detecta un problema relacionado con el sensor, se debe inspeccionar su estado.\nEn algunos casos es posible limpiarlo, pero lo más habitual es tener que sustituirlo. El coste de esta pieza varía según la marca y el modelo del coche, pero suele ser asumible y compensa si con ello evitamos averías mayores.\nAunque se puede cambiar sin herramientas complejas, lo recomendable es que lo haga un profesional para asegurar un correcto montaje.\n¿Cada cuánto tiempo debe revisarse?\nNo hay un intervalo fijo, pero los fabricantes suelen recomendar revisar o sustituir el sensor de oxígeno entre los 100.000 y 150.000 kilómetros. En vehículos antiguos o mal mantenidos, el desgaste puede aparecer antes.\nRealizar revisiones periódicas del sistema de escape y estar atento a cualquier síntoma de fallo ayuda a prolongar la vida útil de este componente.\nLa importancia de un sensor en buen estado\nAunque pase desapercibido, el sensor de oxígeno tiene un papel fundamental: permite que el coche funcione de forma eficiente y sin contaminar más de la cuenta. Cuando falla, el motor consume más combustible, emite más gases y rinde peor.\nDetectarlo a tiempo y sustituirlo cuando corresponde es una forma sencilla de ahorrar dinero, cuidar el medio ambiente y mantener tu coche en buen estado durante más tiempo.",
