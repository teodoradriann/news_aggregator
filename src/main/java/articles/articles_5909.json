    "title": "Heavy rain in Norwich, Connecticut, may cause flooding, power outages",
    "text": "Up to three inches of rain expected in Norwich area. How officials are preparing Heavy rain is expected in the Norwich area over the weekend. The National Weather Service’s Forecast Office in Norton, Massachusetts, predicts the rain to start between 6 and 8 a.m. Saturday and conclude around midnight on Sunday. Two to three inches of rain is expected in the Norwich area. A flood watch will be in effect throughout Connecticut from 8 a.m. Saturday to 8 a.m. Sunday. Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall may cause flooding of small streams and rivers, urban areas, highways and low-lying spots. Chris Riley, communications manager for Norwich Public Utilities, said the company will monitor the rainfall closely and react to whatever comes their way. Concerns for flooding, power outages “We know that the dam in Occum is always a concern,” Riley said. “We know that flooding in the streets can be a challenge for us and also the public works department and following the weather closely is a critical first step. And then if the situation deteriorates after we get a bunch of rain, we will make sure that we have the right material and equipment and personnel in place so that we can respond.” Riley said another concern for Norwich Public Utilities is cars driving in this weekend’s weather. The weather might cause a car to crash into a utility pole, causing power outages for hundreds of customers and a challenging restoration process for the Norwich Public Utilities line department.",

Começou um dia antes, aquele menino que morreu era nosso vizinho no Líbano. Ligaram para gente, converso muito com os pais dele. Chamei meu irmão, o pai da Myrna, mas ele não respondeu. Depois ligou outro irmão meu, falando que atacaram a casa do irmão'.“Ele estava na cidade, na casa do sogro dele, e foi embora porque a casa dele é muito afastada. Foi ela e o pai buscar roupa e coisas da escola que eles tinham comprado porque iriam começar as aulas. Foi quando aconteceu o ataque, morreram na hora, ficaram nos escombros até o outro dia e não conseguiram tirar porque os aviões atacavam.”A família é de Santa Catarina. Myrna se mudou para o Líbano com a família quando era bebê.'[O pai disse que] ela era muito inteligente na escola e esse ano ia trazer ela para conhecer, ela tem direito de vir para cá. Disse que, depois que terminasse e a escola, viria conhecer [Balneário Camboriú]. A gente fala, dói na gente, quando a gente vê na TV, no Brasil, que fala que atacou base militar… Não tem nada disso, é tudo civil, posto de gasolina.

If you don’t like the idea of serving wine in boxes, put it in simple glass carafes for guests to help themselves, or use your slow cooker to make mulled wine. In most cases, you’ll pay less per ounce for a case of beer (and even less for a keg) than for a six- or 12-pack. Larger containers of spirits and wine are also less expensive per ounce.
