    "text": "Man killed by car driven into crowd was ‘Good Samaritan’ helping a stranger By Press Association December 28 2023, 7.37pm Share Man killed by car driven into crowd was ‘Good Samaritan’ helping a stranger Share via Facebook Twitter Linkedin Whatsapp Messenger Email Post link https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk-world/4852820/man-killed-by-car-driven-into-crowd-was-good-samaritan-helping-a-stranger/ Copy Link A police cordon on Scott Road, Burngreave (Dave Higgens/PA)\nA father-of-two who died after a car ploughed in a crowd of people during disturbance was a Good Samaritan who was trying to help a stranger, police have said.\nOn Thursday night, South Yorkshire Police named the 46-year-old man who died in the incident in College Close, in the Burngreave area of Sheffield, as Christian Marriott.\nThe force said Mr Marriott, who was known as Chris, was out for a post-Christmas walk with his wife and two young sons, aged eight and six, when he went to the aid of a woman he spotted lying unconscious in the street just after 2pm on Wednesday.\nOfficers believe he left his family and stopped to provide first aid to the woman, before a car then collided with them both and a number of others.\nIt is believed the woman had been involved in an altercation and several other people suffered injuries during the incident, including an off-duty midwife who had also stopped to help.\nDetective Chief Inspector Andrew Knowles said: “This is an utterly heartbreaking case in which a Good Samaritan, who had stepped in to help a stranger in their time of need, has lost his life.\n“Chris leaves behind a loving family including his devastated wife and two young sons. We are absolutely determined to secure justice for Chris and his loved ones following this horrific tragedy.”\nTwo men arrested in connection with the incident – one on suspicion of murder – remain in custody, the force said.\nChristian Marriott (South Yorkshire Police/PA) Burngreave residents said the incident happened outside a house at the junction of College Close and College Court – two quiet cul-de-sacs of modern houses near Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital.\nPolice had already been called to a violent disturbance in the street when the car ploughed into those gathered outside.\nNeighbours said the altercation was related to some kind of dispute between two families.\nMr Knowles said: “Increased patrols will continue in the area in the coming days and local people will continue to see officers carrying out inquiries, including going house to house to gather witness statements.\n“There are people in that community who hold information which is vital to our investigation and have not yet given statements.\n“I want to be able to get to the bottom of what happened for Chris and his family. I need those people with information to do the right thing. If you don’t want to talk to us directly, you can use Crimestoppers and remain 100% anonymous.”\nA 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 55-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Both remained in custody on Thursday night.\nA police spokeswoman said the woman Mr Marriott was helping remains in hospital in a life-threatening condition.\nShe said the off-duty midwife suffered minor injuries, another man received serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening and four further people – three women and a man – suffered minor injuries.\nTarek Nayli, 49, said he came out of his nearby home to see fighting in the street, a number of injured people and neighbours telling him there were others trapped under a car.\nThe scene of incident in the Burngreave area of Sheffield (Dave Higgens/PA) Mr Nayli said: “I heard a lot of sound, a lot of voices, a lot of shouting.\n“When I came out, I found people all gathering around and people fighting.\n“One guy had a lot of blood on his face.”\nMr Nayli said the car involved was already there by the time he became aware of the incident and the police arrived two minutes after he did.\nHe said: “I saw people fighting on that corner before the police came and the car was already there.\n“The whole neighbourhood was out.”\nHe said: “They said there were people underneath the car and when the police came they managed to get them out.\n“When the police came, they flipped the car over and they’ve taken two people out.”\nMr Nayli said one injured man was already sitting beside the car and a woman was also clearly hurt.\nPolice in College Close, Sheffield (Dave Higgens/PA) Asked about the fighting he saw, he said: “I didn’t see any weapons but there was a lot of hitting and one guy had a stick.”\nMr Nayli said he only found out later that someone had died.\nHe said: “It was very, very sad and also very upsetting and I couldn’t believe it.\n“All of a sudden you find people dead and a very big crime. This is a disaster.”\nOn Thursday morning, police continued to guard an extensive cordon around the close, which about a mile and a half from the city centre.\nThe cordon was dropped later in the day as forensic officers and detectives continued their inquiries in the small semi-detached property.",

    "text": "Le porte-parole du ministère iranien des Affaires étrangères a condamné les « raids violents » d’Israël contre Gaza et Beyrouth, affirmant que l’inaction de la communauté internationale face aux agressions du régime de Tel-Aviv sert à normaliser « le crime et le mal ». « Nous condamnons avec la plus grande fermeté l’attaque barbare d’aujourd’hui menée par le régime sioniste contre une école au camp de réfugiés de Jabalia à Gaza, ainsi que la violation de la souveraineté et de l’intégrité territoriale du Liban et la frappe aérienne sur la banlieue sud de Beyrouth », a déclaré, ce jeudi 26 septembre, Nasser Kanaani dans un message sur X. Au moins quinze Palestiniens ont été tués lors d’une attaque sur le camp de réfugiés de Jabalia. Simultanément, l’artillerie israélienne a pilonné plusieurs zones à Gaza. Parallèlement, une frappe israélienne sur Dahiyeh, banlieue sud de Beyrouth, a également tué au moins deux personnes et en a blessé 15 autres. Kanaani a critiqué l’inaction de la communauté internationale face aux raids continus du régime israélien en Palestine et au Liban. « L’inaction de la communauté internationale face au régime criminel d’Israël et ses crimes de guerre en Palestine et au Liban n’a d’autre résultat que la normalisation du crime et du mal. », a-t-il déploré, avant d’ajouter que cette inaction « discréditerait les Nations unies, le droit international, les traités et conventions internationaux ». Kanaani a averti que l’inaction continue entraînerait « des menaces croissantes et irréparables à la paix et à la sécurité internationales ». Lors d’une réunion d’urgence du Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU sur la situation au Liban, le ministre iranien des Affaires étrangères, Abbas Araqchi, a mis en garde contre une catastrophe imminente et sans précédent en Asie de l’Ouest à cause des agressions et des crimes d’Israël contre les nations de la région. Depuis le début de l’agression israélienne à Gaza en octobre 2023, près de 41 500 Palestiniens ont été tués et plus de 96 000 blessés. Au Liban, les récents raids israéliens ont fait plus de 1 540 morts et environ 5 410 blessés.",

Des relevés plutôt positifs : la dernière campagne de mesure de la qualité de l'eau de la Seine, entre le 10 et le 16 juillet, a montré que la Seine, à Paris, a atteint les seuils européens de conformité à la baignade pour 75% des points suivis, sur quatre jours, selon la préfecture d'Île-de-France en charge des analyses. Au niveau du site olympique du pont Alexandre-III, qui doit accueillir plusieurs épreuves des Jeux olympiques en eau libre, ce niveau a été atteint six jours sur sept, laissant espérer un bon déroulement des épreuves qui doivent se tenir sur le fleuve, [dans lequel se sont baignés cette semaine la maire de Paris Anne Hidalgo et le président du comité d'organisation de Jeux Tony Estanguet](/politique/2024/07/17/c-est-tres-agreable-on-a-assiste-a-la-baignade-d-anne-hidalgo-dans-la-seine). C'est en effet dans la Seine que doivent se dérouler les épreuves de triathlon, de natation-marathon et de paratriathlon cet été.

L'ouvrage permet de récupérer les eaux surabondantes, pour éviter de saturer les réseaux d'évacuation des eaux sales en cas de fortes intempéries, ce qui engendre des rejets dans le fleuve, et provoque de la pollution. Son activation le 11 juillet « a permis d'éviter le rejet de près de 15 000 m3 d'eau usées dans la Seine, et a contribué à un rétablissement rapide de la qualité de l'eau, à nouveau conforme le 14 juillet », indique la préfecture.",

    "text": "Four Colorado cattle organizations sent a letter Thursday to Gov. Jared Polis and Colorado Parks and Wildlife Director Jeff Davis imploring the two to put a stop to the wolf depredations that have been plaguing ranchers in recent months. The Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, the state's largest livestock organization, along with the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association, North Park Stockgrowers Association and Routt County Cattlemen’s Association addressed a myriad of concerns in the letter regarding what they called a lack of implementation of the state's wolf recovery plan. The focus of the lengthy letter called for the lethal removal of the two released wolves that had at least one pup this spring and were named the Copper Creek Pack in Grand County. \"The depredations in the areas encompassed by these local organizations, as well as the recent denial of a Middle Park Stockgrowers’ application for a Chronic Depredation Permit, underscores broader systemic issues that we believe jeopardizes not only the livelihood of livestock producers but also the long-term viability of a balanced wolf-livestock management strategy in our state,\" the letter read. The Coloradoan asked Colorado Parks and Wildlife for a response to the letter at 12:25 p.m. Thursday. A response was not provided by the time this story published Thursday afternoon. A statement written by CPW Director Jeff Davis was finally provided Friday morning by spokesperson Joey Livingston. Requests for an interview with the director have not been granted. “We’re working hard to resolve wolf-livestock conflicts and focusing even more on education and non-lethal management techniques to support ranchers,\" a portion of Davis' statement read. \"CPW is working on all fronts and taking a necessary and adaptive approach to implementing the state’s Wolf Restoration and Management Plan and to implement state statute.” The letter sent by the cattle organizations said Colorado Parks and Wildlife's recent denial of a lethal take permit despite documented and increasingly common depredations, \"Highlights a troubling trend of prioritizing wolves over the legitimate needs and rights of livestock producers. The protections of depredating apex predators should not come at the expense of livestock producers who have demonstrated a clear and ongoing threat to their livestock and livelihood.\" Colorado Parks and Wildlife has confirmed 24 cattle and sheep have been killed by wolves since April 2 , including the most recent depredations of eight sheep July 28 in Grand County . Those 24 depredations have occurred in Grand, Jackson and Routt counties. The letter points out the depredation number does not include undocumented losses of missing livestock and other suspected deaths by ranchers that \"CPW was incapable or unwilling to deem a depredation earlier in the year.'' \"CPW has confirmed that many of the confirmed depredations were caused by just two of the approximately 12 gray wolves located in Colorado,\" the letter stated. One of the wolves captured in Oregon and released in Colorado in late December was killed by a mountain lion. The state wildlife agency collared 12 known wolves in the state. Two of those collars are no longer working, according to the agency. The state wildlife agency previously confirmed to the Coloradoan one of the collars not working is wolf 2309. Grand County Ranchers told the Coloradoan previously they have identified through game camera videos and images, tracks, numerous sightings over several months and locations of where wolves were released to identify 2309 is the breeding male of the Copper Creek Pack and the one they claim is the primary killer of livestock in the area near the den. Wolf 2309 is an adult male that was part of the Weneha Pack in Oregon. That pack had two confirmed livestock depredations in October and September of 2023 in Oregon , just months before the December release in Colorado. They also said they identified through numerous sightings the breeding female of the Copper Creek Pack as wolf 2312 and told the Coloradoan they believe her to be another primary killer of livestock in the area. Colorado Parks and Wildlife has a policy of not publicly identifying individual wolf collar numbers for the safety of the wolves and has not confirmed 2309 and 2312 as the breeding pair or primary killers of livestock in Grand County. The cattle organizations have repeatedly asked Director Davis to remove those two wolves. Davis has refused, citing it would harm the ability to grow the state's wolf population as outlined in the state recovery plan to a minimum of 150 to 200 wolves over the next three to five years. Thursday's letter said by comparison, in 2023, Montana with a wolf population of 1,096 had 32 livestock confirmed killed by wolves, only eight fewer than Colorado had with 12 known wolves. \"The obvious reason Montana has experienced fewer depredations-per-wolf is that Montana effectively manages its wolf population,\" the letter read. \"In contrast, CPW has shown an alarming unwillingness to address wolf-livestock conflicts, creating a dangerous and unsustainable precedent. By refusing to manage problem wolves, CPW has allowed livestock depredations to continue unchecked, while at the same time fostering a pack of depredating wolves.\" Tim Ritschard, Grand County rancher and president of the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association told the Coloradoan on Thursday, the state wildlife agency continues to \"move the goal posts\" on ranchers, which complicates things for them. \"We want them to finally make a decision to remove those wolves,\" he said. \"We are not reinventing the wheel; lethal removal of wolves has already been done in five states.\" The letter stated the lethal take permit denial further erodes trust and cooperation between producers and wildlife managers, putting the long-term sustainability of Colorado’s ranching industry at risk. \"A more balanced, honest, and transparent strategy is needed — one that allows for lethal control when clearly justified, ensures that nonlethal measures are practical and effective in Colorado settings, and respects the rights of livestock producers. CPW’s chronic depredation permit decision must be reconsidered; a permit should be issued as soon as possible.\"",

    "title": "Planned float in NYC’s India Day Parade criticized for being anti-Muslim",
    "text": "Several South Asian American organizations and lawmakers are condemning a float that will be on display Sunday at the India Day Parade in New York City, saying it’s overtly anti-Muslim.\nThe float, announced in a promotional video, will feature a large model of the Ram Mandir, a Hindu temple built on contested religious ground in the north Indian city of Ayodhya. The temple was built on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque, Babri Masjid, which was demolished by Hindu nationalist mobs in 1992.\nWidespread riots across India followed in the ‘90s, and thousands of people, primarily Muslims, were killed.\nIn 2019, India’s Supreme Court greenlit the construction of the Hindu temple on the site, and it was inaugurated earlier this year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nAyodhya is a holy city for Hindus, and some believe the site of the temple was the birthplace of the deity Ram. But for Muslims, the grand opening represents continued marginalization by Modi’s right-wing Hindu nationalist government.\nPrevious India Day Parades in New York City have drawn tens of thousands of people. Advocates worry a Ram Mandir float this year will send the wrong message.\n“A float celebrating the construction of the Ram Temple would be divisive, and runs counter to the values of New York City,” said a letter to NYC Mayor Eric Adams signed by three South Asian lawmakers in New York: councilmembers Shekar Krishnan and Shahana Hanif, and state assembly member Zohran Mamdani.\nAdams responded to the outrage as he took part in a larger news conference on Tuesday, saying there’s no place for hate in the city.\n“I want to send the right symbolic gesture that the city’s open to everyone and there’s no room for hate,” he said. “If there is a float or a person in the parade that’s promoting hate, they should not.”\nAdams has marched in the parade in previous years, he said, but this year he wasn’t invited or made aware of it happening. Responding to questions about Muslim New Yorkers’ concerns, he added that he’s always supported them.\n“I have a long record on standing up on behalf of the Muslim community, probably a record that’s more impressive than any other elected officials,” he said. “I’m not going to be judged by man, God judges me.”\nOrganizers of the event emphasized in a July news release that the parade aims to celebrate all of India’s communities.\n“This celebration is an inclusive event that proudly represents the rich tapestry of India’s cultural diversity and will feature floats from various communities, including Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, and Christian faiths, underscoring the belief that we are all integral parts of this community, regardless of caste, creed, or religion,” said Dr. Avinash Gupta, president of the Federation of Indian Associations, which runs the event.\nBut Muslim and progressive South Asian groups say the Ram Mandir float has to go for the event to be truly inclusive.\n“Allowing such a hateful and bigoted celebration in NYC is an affront to American values and to harmony and peaceful coexistence among our diverse communities,” said another letter to Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul sent by a coalition of 22 organizations. “It emboldens Hindu extremists to advance their supremacist agenda in the United States and glorifies acts of violence injustice and discrimination against Muslims.”\nNew York should consider all of its South Asian communities, the lawmakers wrote.\n“As proud Indian-American and Bangladeshi-American, Hindu and Muslim elected officials representing New York City communities, we welcome the celebration of Indian culture and heritage on the streets of our great city. However, such public celebrations should not include symbols of division or bigotry,” they wrote.\nThe post Planned float in NYC’s India Day Parade criticized for being anti-Muslim appeared first on NBC News .",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main)\n'Small Town Heritage': New Brunswick clothing brand embraces rural roots\nHigh school student Emma Graham knew she wanted to attend university outside of her hometown of Sussex, N.B., in the fall of 2024. In order to do so, she’d need to raise some money.\nIn August, she began brainstorming ideas with her mother, before settling on creating a clothing brand called “Small Town Roots.”\n“Everybody has been super, super supportive,” says Graham, who is now five months into her business venture.\n“We’ve sold out almost every single time we bring it stock. It doesn’t last long and we always have people demanding for more.”\nGraham’s mother, Leeann Nichol, has helped her daughter with the company.\n“It’s something Emma is passionate about,” says Nichol.\n“I put a lot of time into it to help out and make sure all the legal stuff is where it needs to be. I deal with that part of it while she takes on the social media aspect of it.”\nGraham says working alongside her mother on the brand has led to some heated discussions, but also a strong partnership.\n“Definitely a lot of butting heads,” jokes the teen.\n“For the most part, we collaborate a lot and we come up with some pretty good ideas together,” says Nichol.\nGraham guesses she has made around $25,000 since starting her company in August.\nShe’s recently rebranded to “\nSmall Town Heritage,” due to copyright issues, and says the brand is a reminder not to forget where you come from.\n“I do plan on going to a city for university,” says Graham.\n“My heart is always going to be in a small town, as it’s my heritage.”\nGraham has enjoyed seeing her merchandise represented around Sussex and the province.\nShe says she has had teachers and fellow students asking her about the company and is excited to head back to school after the winter break to see how many people had her brand under the Christmas tree.\nGraham has been recognized locally for her business efforts. Late in 2023, the entrepreneur earned the Emerging Business Award from the Sussex Chamber of Commerce during their year-end awards, beating out some well-established names in the process.\n“It definitely brought up the confidence in how successful my business is becoming,” says Graham.\nNichol says her daughter’s success gives her a great sense of pride.\n“It’s a moment of like awe when I watch her and see how much community support there is for her,” says Nichol.\n“People come up to me and say what a wonderful job she is doing.”\nGraham has been accepted to multiple schools for the fall, but has yet to decide where she will go. She hopes to continue with “Small Town Heritage” once university begins, but says she will wait and see what the workload is like before committing one way or the other.\nFor more New Brunswick news visit our\ndedicated provincial page.\nShopping Trends\nThe Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

Originalmente pedían siete días, pero la versión final se redujo en las negociaciones durante el proceso legislativo.\nLa Coalición Trabajo y Familia de California elogió la ley (una de varias medidas en la última sesión destinadas a mejorar el equilibrio entre el trabajo y la vida privada) como “un cambio de sentido común”.\nPero las asociaciones comerciales que representan a diversas industrias, como la California Grocers Association y la California Hotel & Lodging Association, así como los grupos de la cámara de comercio de todo el estado, argumentaron que la ley perjudicaría a las pequeñas empresas que no se han recuperados de la pandemia, ahora están lidiando con inflación y no pueden permitirse el costo adicional de cubrir a los trabajadores enfermos.\nLa Federación Nacional de Empresas Independientes enumera la nueva ley entre sus cinco principales “dolores de cabeza de cumplimiento” para los propietarios de pequeñas empresas de California en 2024, junto con la SB 848, que hace ilegal que los trabajadores rechacen hasta cinco días de “ licencia por pérdida reproductiva”, por abortos espontáneos, adopciones fallidas y otros eventos.\nLa Cámara de Comercio del estado tenía la ley de licencia por enfermedad en su lista de “asesinos de empleo” y recientemente emitió una guía para que los trabajos naveguen por las complejidades de la ley.\nNo existe ninguna ley federal que obligue a los trabajadores a otorgar a los trabajadores licencia por enfermedad remunerada. California se convirtió en el segundo estado del país en adoptar una política de licencia por enfermedad remunerada en 2014, pero ahora ofrece menos tiempo que 15 estados y muchas de sus propias ciudades, incluidas San Diego, Los Ángeles, San Francisco, Oakland y Berkeley.\nAl firmar el proyecto de ley el 4 de octubre, Newsom dijo que muchas personas todavía tenían que elegir entre saltarse el salario de un día y cuidar de sí mismos o de sus familiares cuando se enferman.\n“Estamos haciendo saber que la salud y el bienestar de los trabajadores y sus familias es de suma importancia para el futuro de California”, dijo en un comunicado.\nEsta no es la primera vez que se introduce una ampliación de las bajas por enfermedad, pero la pandemia de COVID-19 amplificó la necesidad. En marzo de 2021, se exigía una nueva ley que los beneficios más grandes concederían hasta 10 días más para las cuarentenas o los efectos secundarios de las vacunas. Pero ese beneficio desapareció, junto con los créditos fiscales federales que lo pagaban, seis meses después.\nCalMatters.org es una organización de medios de comunicación sin fines de lucro, no partidista, que explica las políticas públicas y los temas políticos de California.\nEl artículo fue publicado originalmente en\nhttps://calmatters.org/economy/2023/12/sick-leave-new-law-california-2024/\nLea más en\nhttps://www.facebook.com/calmatters y www.calmatters.org.",
