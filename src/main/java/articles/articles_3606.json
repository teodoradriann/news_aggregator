    "text": "> PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, Dec 29 — Israeli forces yesterday battled Hamas in Gaza where air strikes and urban combat rocked the southern city of Khan Yunis, near where many hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge.\nAdvertisement UN World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for “urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril” facing besieged Gaza’s people, including “terrible injuries, acute hunger and... severe risk of disease”.\nIn Jerusalem, families of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza again rallied for their release, and a kibbutz announced that a 70-year-old US-Israeli thought to be the oldest woman held captive had died in the October 7 attacks.\nUS President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” by the news Judith Weinstein Haggai was dead, and pledged that Washington will “not stop working” with its ally Israel to bring the remaining hostages home.\nAdvertisement The war, which started with Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, has left much of northern Gaza in ruins while the battlefront has shifted ever further to the south of the besieged territory.\nThe Israeli army said it had deployed an additional brigade to Khan Yunis, hometown of Hamas’s Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, where AFP correspondents reported sustained air and artillery strikes.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent society reported that shelling had killed at least 10 people near the city’s Al-Amal hospital, an area where it said about 14,000 people are sheltering.\nAdvertisement Later yesterday, Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry said 20 people were killed, most of them women and children, and dozens wounded in shelling of the Shaboura camp in the southern city of Rafah.\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nHamas on October 7 also took 250 hostages, more than half of whom remain captive — a source of intense anxiety for their families who protested in Jerusalem with the demand to “bring them home”.\nIsrael’s relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 21,320 people, mostly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry.\nAshraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the ministry, yesterday reported an additional 200 deaths, “including entire families”, over the past 24 hours in strikes.\nThe Israeli army says 167 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza in its fight against Hamas which Israel, the United States and European Union consider a “terrorist” group.\nIn total, the army said, more than 500 soldiers had been killed since October 7, including in the Hamas attack and the battle to retake control of southern Israel, inside Gaza, and in cross-border hostilities with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\nQuadruplets born in war\nMore than 80 per cent of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been driven from their homes, the UN says, and many now live in cramped shelters or makeshift tents in the far south, around the city of Rafah near Egypt.\nIn the central al-Maghazi refugee camp, which was targeted on Sunday by a strike that killed at least 70 people, resident Waleed Mohammed Aeid voiced his pain and frustration.\n“They told us to go to Rafah, but we don’t want to,” he said. “Why? To go live in the streets there?\n“All the neighbourhood here was evacuated. They bombed the school, but we didn’t leave because we don’t have anywhere else to go.”\nAn Israeli siege imposed after October 7, following years of crippling blockade, has deprived Gazans of food, water, fuel and medicine.\nThe severe shortages have been only sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt.\nIsrael said yesterday it had given preliminary approval to the Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus for a “maritime lifeline” to ship aid to Gaza.\n“There’s a basic authorisation to use this route, but there are still some logistical problems that are waiting to be solved,” said Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat.\nOne of the many Palestinians displaced, 28-year-old Iman al-Masry, recently gave birth to quadruplets in southern Gaza after fleeing her home in the devastated north.\nThe arduous journey “affected my pregnancy”, she said, recounting that she gave birth by C-section on December 18 to two girls and two boys, one of whom was too fragile to leave hospital.\n“They are very slim,” she said, speaking in a schoolroom turned shelter in Deir al-Balah. “It’s cold and windy and there’s no bathtub... I just use wipes.”\nMideast tensions flare\nViolence has also flared across the Israel-occupied West Bank, with at least 314 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or settlers since October 7, according to the territory’s health ministry.\nIsraeli forces overnight raided money exchange shops across the West Bank which the military said had provided funds for armed groups.\nIn Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority, one man was killed by the troops, according to the health ministry, and another was later shot near Bethlehem.\nA UN report said the human rights situation in the West Bank was rapidly deteriorating and urged Israel to “end unlawful killings” against the Palestinian population.\nThe bloodiest ever Gaza war has also sharply heightened tensions between Israel and its long-time arch foe Iran, which supports armed groups across the Middle East.\nIran blamed Israel for a missile strike in Syria on Monday that killed the senior Iranian military commander Razi Moussavi, whose mass funeral took place in Tehran yesterday.\nThe crowd chanted “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led a prayer over the body of Moussavi, a top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ foreign operations arms the Quds Force.\nTehran has vowed to avenge the death of the most senior Guards general killed since the US assassination of Quds Force chief Qasem Soleimani in 2020.\nIsrael has traded heavy cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon since the Gaza war erupted, and warned it will step up military action unless Hezbollah militants withdraw further from the border.\nHezbollah accused Israel of hacking into CCTV camera systems installed outside homes and shops in southern Lebanon and urged residents there to take the devices offline.\nAnother Iran ally, Yemen’s Huthi rebel group, has launched repeated drone and missile attacks at Israel, which have been intercepted. It has also targeted ships in the Red Sea, disrupting international trade. — AFP",

    "title": "Thousands of Boeing aircraft workers vote for strike action",
    "text": "More than 30,000 Boeing aircraft construction workers are to go on strike from today (Friday). The mass walkout by union members who produce models such as the 737 Max and 777 in Seattle and Portland was signalled as they rejected a deal that included at 25% pay rise. Machinists voted overwhelmingly by almost 95% to reject the contract offer and by 96% in favour of strike action. The strike was due to start at midnight local US Pacific Time with picket lines to be deployed at designated factory locations. The International Association of Machinist (IAM) union authorised the first strike at Boeing in 16 years. The walkout came as workers rejected a new four-year contract for workers, described by the union as including “substantial raises” including a 25% increase over the life of the deal. IAM said prior to the contract rejection: “Financially, the company finds itself in a tough position due to many self-inflicted missteps. “It is IAM members who will bring this company back on track. As has been said many times, there is no Boeing without the IAM. “Ultimately, we love this company and couldn’t be more proud of the jobs we do or the products we build. What we do defines who we are – these crafts are our livelihoods. When a plane leaves the factory, it’s our reputation on the line. This proposal helps keep our legacy alive.” However, Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing, said after the ballot result: “This is about fighting for our future. “We will be back at the table whenever we can get there to drive forward on the issues our members say are important.” Boeing’s new chief executive Kelly Ortberg had acknowledged in a letter to employees earlier this week that members had been upset over past contract terms, but he urged union members to move past that and vote for the deal. Boeing has yet to comment on the strike declaration.",

    "text": "Former NBA player Charlie Villanueva and his wife, Lala, got in a bad car accident recently, but they are thankful to be safe without major injuries. Villanueva shared photos of his damaged vehicle on Instagram and said the driver that rear-ended them fled the scene. Villanueva said he had purchased the Mercedes G Wagon for his wife's birthday and \"didn't even have it for two months\" before the incident. \"One thing we never take for granted is leaving the house and making it back home,\" Villanueva wrote. \"If you wondering what happened, my wife and I got hit bad by another car, and the crazy part is that whomever hit me, decided to run. Sore neck, sore back, messed up car, we are thankful to see another day. Our lives can't be replaced, but the vehicle can.\" The 39-year-old spent 11 seasons in the NBA after being drafted by the Toronto Raptors as the No. 7 pick in the 2005 NBA draft . He finished second among rookies in points and rebounds and made the All-Rookie First Team. Villanueva also played for the Bucks , Pistons and Mavericks before retiring in 2016. While it was a scary incident, Villanueva said this helped him put things in perspective and be thankful for being safe. \"Thank you God for protecting us. We must walk in faith not by sight,\" he wrote. \"2023 is just preparing us for 2024. So to those whom 2023 has been a difficult year, a year of struggle be thankful, and don't give up, because once you come out of the storm, you'll see your true power.\"",

Te sorprenderá y dejarás de jugar a las diferencias.\nHezbolá no es Hamas. Dispone de muchos soldados, bien entrenados, una considerable mala leche y armamento avanzado en forma de misiles de precisión que les pueden meter por su sionista culo.\nHasta ahora solo se han estado devolviendo pepinazos medidamente uno y otro, pero en caso de conflicto abierto no le será tan fácil a los genocidas devolver al Líbano a la Edad de Piedra.\n[#4](c4#c-4) hezbola e Israel no deberían jugar a sus juegos de guerra en territorios que son de otros países y en los que se puede dañar a civiles que viven ahí.\n[#4](c4#c-4) AH, ahora entiendo esto:\nhttps://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2024/06/19/el-jefe-de-hezbollah-amenazo-a-israel-y-dijo-que-si-estalla-una-guerra-mas-amplia-lucharan-sin-normas-ni-limites/\nEl jefe de Hezbollah amenazó a Israel y dijo que si estalla una guerra más amplia lucharán “sin normas ni límites”\nSe amenazan, se quieren pegar, se van a pegar. No se sabrá quién empezó.\n[#4](c4#c-4) israel tiene a eeuu, uk y francia, como mínimo, a su disposición... así que no sé... pero, claro, a ver en qué desemboca eso.\nLo que me sigue pareciendo \"curioso\" (ni de coña...) es que nadie hable de cómo israel invade otras regiones... más comparaciones con la alemania nazi debería haber... pero, de occidente, sólo me espero mentiras, excusas, hipocrecía y apoyo al genocida.\nPues se les hace un rusia, se les bloquea de todos lados, sanciones, vetos , fuera del Swift...y enviamos al libanos armamento y miles de millones\nY aquí no pasa nada, la amenaza si fuese de cualquier otro país que no esté en la órbita de EEUU la respuesta seria contundente, pero con Israel la cosa es diferente, pueden esquilmar, masacrar y hacer desaparecer a miles de habitantes, que aquí no pasa nada. Todo muy justo para la población asesinada y sus familias, claro, todos eran terroristas.\n[#36](c36#c-36) según la torá, la creación tiene 5761 años, lo que no es mucho para estar donde estamos si pensamos que la edad de piedra duró casi 3 millones de años. Por otro lado, los primeros pobladores de la tierra según las escrituras, tras Adán y Eva fueron Caín y Abel, que eran Agricultor y Ganadero. La agricultura no se desarrolló hasta hace 12.000 años, y ya es mucho más avanzado que lo que entendemos por edad de piedra.\n[#12](c12#c-12) El la serie Friends el personaje Ross era un judío paleontólogo. Su religión le dice que la tierra la creó su dios hace unos 5.000 años pero trabaja con huesos de 60 millones de años.\nNo hay por donde cogerlos.\n[#6](c6#c-6) el primero que tira la bomba pierde. Es lo que tienen los nukes, que solo sirven para fardar, pero no para usarlos.\n[#7](c7#c-7) No pueden llevarse bien con los vecinos porque tienen una novela delirante en la que un personaje imaginario les dijo que toda esa tierra es suya, como si fuera un notario.\nY en ello están, robando todo como quijotes pero con sangre de verdad.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No creo sean capaz, aunque están muy crecidos. Ahora si lo hacen, al igual que las otras veces es con las lametadas (que no permiso) de EEUU.\nLos putos sionistas lo que quieren es nuevos territorios que colonizar para el gran Israel, todo lo demás son optics.
