    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs defeat Miami Dolphins in conditions so cold that head coach Andy Reid’s mustache freezes\n(CNN) — The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Miami Dolphins 26-7 at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday, in conditions so cold that Chiefs head coach Andy Reid’s mustache froze over.\nThe temperature at kickoff was -4 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of -20 degrees, making it\nthe fourth coldest game in National Football League history, according to the Peacock broadcast.\nPictures of Reid with icicles in his facial hair have since gone viral on social media.\nAmid the brutal conditions, the Kansas City offense hit the ground running, marching down the field on the opening drive and capping it off with an 11-yard touchdown throw from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Rashee Rice. Rice would go on to finish the game with eight receptions for 130 yards.\nThe Chiefs never looked back, shutting down the Dolphins offense completely.\nChiefs’ kicker Harrison Butker went 4 for 4 on field goals and running back Isiah Pacheco ran it in for a three-yard rushing touchdown to put the game on ice (literally) in the fourth quarter.\nMahomes finished the game with 262 yards and a touchdown.\nTaylor Swift was in attendance and braved the frigid temperatures wearing a #87 Kelce jacket in support of her beau Travis Kelce. Kelce finished the game with seven receptions for 71 yards.\nAt the end of the game, the temperature was -9 degrees and felt like -28 degrees, according to the broadcast.\nPlayers could be seen huddling by pitch-side heaters and many made the most of heated benches in a bid to keep out the cold.\nMahomes downplayed the weather, saying “it is what it is” when asked about it on the Peacock broadcast after the game.\n“We’re in Kansas City, at Arrowhead,” Mahomes said. “We are going to play in some games like this. So, our mentality was to come out here, play football and see what happens.”\nStill, Saturday’s conditions are rivaled by the coldest NFL game on record: the December 1967 “Ice Bowl” in Wisconsin, when the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys amid -13 air temperature and a -48 wind chill, according to the NFL.\nEarlier on Saturday, the Houston Texans defeated the Cleveland Browns 45-14.\nIt was a historic day for rookie Texans quarterback CJ Stroud, who threw for 274 yards and three touchdowns. Stroud’s three touchdown passes tied a rookie record in a playoff game. The 23-year-old former second-overall pick also became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in NFL history.\nThe NFL playoffs continue on Sunday with the Green Bay Packers heading to Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. Matthew Stafford will also make his grand return to the city where he started his NFL career when the Los Angeles Rams take on the Detroit Lions.\nOn Monday, the Pittsburgh Steelers head to a snowy Orchard Park, New York, to take on the Buffalo Bills and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Philadelphia Eagles.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Roma, 28 mar. (askanews) - Al via in tutta Italia le manifestazioni dei metalmeccanici che protestano per il rinnovo del contratto. La trattativa per il rinnovo del contratto è bloccata dal 12 novembre scorso e, con una nota congiunta, Fim, Fiom e Uilm ricordano di aver avanzato proposte per rilanciare l'industria e il lavoro nel settore. Nel video i cortei di Roma e Milano. \"Vogliamo confermare le norme del precedente contratto e stabilire gli aumenti in particolare riguardo al salario - dicono i sindacati di categoria - loro (Federmeccanica) non vogliono dare certezza e garantire sugli aumenti\".\"Tutti parlano dei bassi salari, tutti raccontano dei bassi salari ma quando gli diciamo che vogliamo contrattare Federmeccanica non si siede al tavolo: è un atto antidemocratico, noi non ci fermeremo fino a quando non riprenderemo la trattativa e porteremo a casa il rinnovo del contratto nazionale\", ha affermato Michele De Palma, segretario generale Fiom Cgil alla manifestazione di Reggio Emilia.Secondo la leader Cisl, Daniela Fumarola \"è inaccettabile che, dopo mesi di trattative interrotte, Federmeccanica e Assistal continuino a ignorare legittime richieste sindacali. Il contratto collettivo è fondamentale per adeguare i salari al costo della vita, migliorare le condizioni di lavoro, generare e redistribuire crescita garantendo maggiore sicurezza, soprattutto negli appalti. Rifiutarsi di rinnovare significa mortificare la dignità, il valore e il ruolo di chi, ogni giorno, contribuisce alla crescita del Paese in settori strategici\", scrive sui social.\"In una situazione come questa, dove ci sono i dazi, la prima cosa importante sono le fabbriche e i lavoratori. I lavoratori difendono l'Italia, difendono la manifattura e con la loro azione hanno sempre debellato questioni negative\", ha rivendicato il segretario generale Uilm, Rocco Palombella alla manifestazione a Napoli.",

    "text": "2023-12-29 23:41:23 NOTICIACRISTIANA.COM- In Australia, young people from the city of Gold Coastcarried out an evangelistic action, where seven people accepted Jesus, and were baptized. Bas Rodwell, a 22-year-old missionary from, “Youth for Christ”said that around 40 people participated in the event, a program that included Gospel ministries and prayers for the students, according to Guide me. Bas testified that a young man who used crutches, after falling from a four-story building, was healed after praying. “After praying, this man’s ankle and toes slowly began to move, and for the first time since 2007, he regained his movement, and he was ecstatic,” Bas told Revive. A volunteer took the opportunity and spoke to the child about Jesus, and he responded: “Yes, God is real. I want to follow Christ, and be baptized,” he confessed. Another young man narrated his testimony: “Six weeks ago, I was in a car accident, but I came out unharmed, and I thought: “God saved me, and rescued me.”” Baptism While Bas was preaching, and explaining what baptism is about, a group of 15 German backpackers, who were walking through the park, approached him and asked him: “Does anyone here want to give their life to Jesus, repent of their sins, and be baptized like these guys?” Bass said. At that moment, one of the backpackers responded: “Yes, I want to follow Jesus, and be baptized,” he said. Then, around 2:30 in the morning, they baptized the seven children. Drawn to Jesus Bas reported that the young people attend church and are disciplined. Through his testimony, other students are drawn to Jesus. “One of the boys who was baptized is my friend. He looks very different. My other friend and I want to know what this is, and we want to get baptized too, because we want what he has now,” said the young man. “Discipleship is really where my heart is. We can go out on the street, and have people say a prayer, and that’s a seed, and God can use it in the future, but I really want to see disciples being made, and people following Jesus, and their lives changing. ”Bas concluded.

    "title": "Dallas Jenkins on CHOSEN's Success: 'God Uses the Humbled'",
    "text": "Dallas Jenkins on THE CHOSEN’s Success: ‘God Uses The Humbled’ By Movieguide® Contributor THE CHOSEN creator, Dallas Jenkins, is discussing how the show has impacted him and its audience. “The different ideas that people have in their heads of who Jesus was is fascinating,” Jenkins [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Qph09B2L8) of his passion for telling the story of Jesus. He also spoke about his desire to humanize these Biblical figures. “We’re going to take them down from stained glass windows, we’re going to take them down from statues, and we’re going to remind ourselves that these people had the same questions, struggles, and doubts that we have,” Jenkins explained. In an interview with Deseret News, he [elaborated](https://www.deseret.com/entertainment/2023/7/6/23785984/the-chosen-dallas-jenkins-season-four): “What I try to do in the show is I try to remove the veil that we sometimes have and just say, this is what it would have looked like in the first century.” The director and writer detailed his journey to making THE CHOSEN. Jenkins’ previous movie had not done well, which meant studios weren’t eager to back his other projects. So, Jenkins turned to crowdfunding. “I imagine that God tends to use the broken and tends to use the humbled, and I wasn’t a humble person until that day,” he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Qph09B2L8) of that moment. The crowdfunding worked — he raised over $11 million for THE CHOSEN, and the show has gone on to be massively popular. While many have commented on the power the show has to draw in both Christians and nonbelievers, Jenkins made it clear that that’s not his intent. “When I’m writing at the computer, when I’m on set directing, I’m not thinking, ‘Oh, I hope this show converts people,’” he said. “That’s not the responsibility of a TV show. Ultimately what happens as a result of the show is between them and God.” Season 4 of THE CHOSEN is set to debut in theaters this February. “Last year, we dipped our toes in the water by releasing a few episodes in theaters. The response was so strong, and Season Four is so big, that we knew we and Fathom had to give viewers the theatrical experience for all eight episodes,” Jenkins [said](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/the-chosen-unveils-season-4-trailer-theatrical-release-date) in a statement about the episodes’ release. Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/the-chosen-drops-season-4-trailer.html) on Season 4 of the THE CHOSEN: THE CHOSEN just dropped the official Season 4 trailer and announced that theatrical tickets for the upcoming season are now available. “Clashing kingdoms. Rival rulers. The enemies of Jesus close in while His followers struggle to keep up, leaving Him to carry the burden alone. Threatened by the reality of Jesus’ growing influence, religious leaders do the unthinkable—ally with their Roman oppressors. As the seeds of betrayal are planted and opposition to Jesus’ message turns violent, He’s left with no alternative but demand his followers RISE UP,” a synopsis of Season 4 [reads](https://www.thechosenriseup.com/synopsis/). The trailer shows Jesus and his followers confronting new challenges as they move towards his coming crucifixion. The eight-episode season will debut in theaters starting this February.",

    "text": "Personal de Vestas Eólica secunda este viernes el sexto día de huelga por un \"convenio digno\"\nLa CIG denuncia que la empresa se \"aferra\" a su \"propuesta de miseria\"\nPersonal de Vestas Eólica secunda este viernes una nueva jornada de huelga, la sexta en este mes de marzo, en demanda de un convenio colectivo digno que \"no suponga un retroceso de los derechos y seguir perdiendo poder adquisitivo\".\nDe ello ha informado la CIG en un comunicado, en el que explica que, con motivo de la huelga, los trabajadores y trabajadoras también realizan una concentración ante las instalaciones de Norvento, en Lugo.\nEl sindicato nacionalista asegura que Vestas, dedicada a la fabricación y mantenimiento de turbinas eólicas --propias y de otras marcas como Gamesa o Suzlon-- emplea a miles de personas en el Estado español.\nSin embargo, denuncia que la empresa \"se niega a negociar de forma efectiva con el personal\". La CIG explica que el pasado martes, la mesa de negociación se cerró sin acuerdo, lo que desencadenó en la aplicación a otros territorios de la huelga iniciada el 10 de marzo en Galicia.\nDesde entonces, conforme indica, los trabajadores de Vestas --a quien se sumaron los de Asturias-- están secundando de forma masiva paros cada lunes y viernes de marzo.\nLa representación de la CIG critica que, lejos de buscar soluciones y abrir \"un diálogo real\", Vestas se \"aferra\" a su postura inicial, rechaza las alternativas formuladas por los sindicatos y, además, \"presiona con la amenaza de ir a convenios provinciales si el personal no acepta sus condiciones\".\nAl tiempo, la central nacionalista sostiene que la empresa ofrece acuerdos individuales a algunas personas \"bajo condiciones dudosas y a coste mínimo, asegurando disponibilidad a clientes como Iberdrola, Naturgy o Enel, pero \"sacrificando los derechos de los que sostienen la actividad diaria: personal técnico, especialista, personal y de campo y de oficinas\".\nA este respecto, los delegados de la CIG señalan que lo único que se demanda es \"un convenio justo que beneficie a ambas partes, no un convenio de mínimos que perjudique al personal\". Además, han atribuido la extensión de las movilizaciones a esta falta de voluntad negociadora de la dirección, a la que acusan de bloquear una salida al conflicto.\n\"Los trabajadores y las trabajadoras de Vestas no solo contribuimos a una transición energética, sino que merecemos condiciones dignas para seguir haciéndolo\", defienden.",

    "title": "AI craze is driving Nasdaq’s best run since 1999",
    "text": "A banner year for stocks is drawing to a close, with gains in Big Tech leaving the market near all-time highs amid exuberance for artificial intelligence and dovish bets on the Federal Reserve’s next moves. In the run-up to the final closing bell of 2023, the Nasdaq marched toward its best year since 1999 amid a $7 trillion surge. The benchmark S&P 500 is approaching a record and was roughly 1% below the average full-year gain predicted in a recent survey with analysts, who forecast the index would end 2024 at 4,833. “If the stock market can break through that record high in any significant way as we move through January, it’s going to be very bullish on a technical basis,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak and Co. “Whenever the market is rallying strongly at the beginning of a new year – when a lot of people are adjusting their investment game plans – it tends to exacerbate the rally.” In a rates-obsessed world, the stock market saw a massive reversal this year after suffering its worst annual selloff since 2008. As traders ramped up bets that the Fed is done with its hiking campaign – and will start easing policy in 2024 – global bonds are set for their biggest two-month gain on record. On Thursday, the S&P 500 traded just a few points away from its all-time high of 4,796.56 – extending its 2023 advance to 25%. Treasuries dropped after a weak $40 billion sale of seven-year notes. The dollar rose against most of its developed-market peers. The yen climbed as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda continued to prepare the ground for the nation’s first rate increase since 2007. From Nvidia to Microsoft, the seven largest U.S. tech stocks were responsible for 64% of the gauge’s rally this year through last week as the AI frenzy took off. The Nasdaq is up 55% this year. The “Magnificent Seven” – which also includes Amazon, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Tesla – are expected to post 22% earnings growth next year, twice the S&P 500’s advance, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The key is how much of that is already baked into share prices, especially with expectations for a soft landing building. “Companies that have a defined and clear AI strategy with easy-to-follow metrics will likely continue to do well in 2024,” said Michael Landsberg at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Companies that have a hard time explaining their AI value proposition will not see a repeat of 2023, where most large tech was buoyed by the excitement and not necessarily the details of AI.” Investors have flocked to Big Tech in part on bets that they are best positioned to capitalize on AI due to their vast scale and financial strength. Those bigger profits have brought valuations down from nosebleed levels – but they’re still lofty. The Nasdaq is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down from a peak of 30 in 2020, it’s well above the average of 19 times over the past two decades. Although there has been a relatively high number of stocks with gains of over 100%, there haven’t been many outperforming the S&P 500, Bespoke Investment Group noted. In a typical year, on average, 48.7% of the benchmark’s members post larger gains than the index itself. In 2023, less than 30% of its members are outpacing the index. “This leads one to question whether the leaders (or laggards) continue to lead (lag) in the year ahead,” the Bespoke strategists said. “Looking at the past, the picture is not exactly favorable for that sort of rotation in either direction.” The market is “sitting on big gains,” and most participants just want the year to end to register those gains, said Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded The Sevens Report newsletter. “But I’ve been in this industry long enough to know that when everyone seems to be leaning on one side of the proverbial canoe, it pays to move to the middle.” Warnings about a market that’s flashing overbought signals have been raising concern about a pullback, with some market observers saying that traders have gone too far, too fast in pricing in a dovish Fed pivot. While the recent ebbing of inflation is positive for the Fed, some other figures showing economic resilience could fuel consumer spending – working against the central bank’s aim to slow the pace of growth. That poses risks for the bond market heading into the new year. Falling yields have also driven the dollar lower in 2023, with the greenback on pace for its worst year since the onset of the pandemic. Much of the decline materialized in the fourth quarter on growing wagers that the Fed will sharply loosen policy next year. The drop in Treasury yields has effectively relaxed financial conditions in the U.S. and is “hardly compatible with sustainably low inflation,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote. “The rally in the sovereign space looks overdone – hence the rally in stocks and the selloff in the U.S. dollar look overstretched,” she wrote in a note. About a week ahead of the all-important U.S. jobs report, traders were unfazed by data showing initial jobless claims rose to 218,000. Economists forecast a still-healthy 170,000 increase in December payrolls, consistent with resilient labor demand that has been key in powering the economy.

    "text": "Russian authorities report that between 115,000 and 133,000 people have evacuated from Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces advanced in the recent weeks, trying to dig in and capturing Russian POWs.\nOn 6 August, Ukraine started a surprise incursion in Kursk Oblast, capturing over 1,250 square kilometers of Russian territory and 92 settlements. The operation continues to this day.\nAccording to Russian media outlet Important Stories , the discrepancies came to light during a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and governors of border regions.\nKursk Governor Alexey Smirnov reported that 133,000 people have evacuated from eight districts deemed at risk, leaving 19,000 residents still in their homes.\nHowever, Russia’s First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov cited a lower figure of 115,000 evacuees. This inconsistency raises questions about the true scale of the displacement.\nThe evacuation affects an area with a total population of 152,000, as stated by Governor Smirnov. He also noted that over 12,000 Russians are currently housed in temporary camps established by authorities.\nMore than 41,000 residents of the region received various payments and more than 200 resettlement certificates were issued, according to Russian authorities.\nThe situation extends beyond Kursk, with Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov describing the socio-economic conditions in his region as continuously “difficult.” Manturov’s characterization of part of the Kursk region as a “zone of escalation” further underscores the seriousness of the situation.\nEarlier, Russian occupiers were reportedly planning to evacuate residents from Kursk Oblast to occupied areas in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, to use them as human shields for military sites. The Ukrainian governor of Zaporizhzhia, Ivan Fedorov, claimed that while isolated cases of resettlement have occurred, there is no evidence of mass relocation to the area.\n Ukraine’s Ministry of Reintegration is also exploring the possibility of establishing a humanitarian corridor from Kursk to Ukraine’s bordering Sumy. Additionally, Ukraine set up a hotline for Kursk residents seeking evacuation assistance.\nColonel Roman Kostenko of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who visited Kursk Oblast, reported that no official evacuation to Ukraine is currently taking place. However, he suggested that some individuals may be leaving the area independently.\nRelated:\nZelenskyy: More Russian POWs and one settlement captured in Kursk Oblast Ukrainian Defense Forces control over 1,250 square kilometers and 92 settlements in Kursk Oblast, says Zelenskyy Russian FSB opens criminal cases against CNN journalist and Ukrainian reporters filming in Kursk Oblast The Telegraph: Putin throws young cannon fodder to Kursk, maintains offensive in Ukraine You could close this page.
