    "title": "Don Kusler: Democrats dominated 2023 with victories for reproductive rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box.\nVirginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office.\nThat's a victory for Democrats.\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate.\nThat's another victory for the left.\nTwo ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state.\nPeople are also reading…\nThen on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin.\nThese electoral victories make a difference.\nJust look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize.\nLabor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts.\nWorkers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers.\nSometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans.\nIt was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business.\nLeadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people.\nThe one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job.\nDid the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker.\nThe sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats.\nSo a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories.\nYes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats.\nKusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action:\nadaction.org.

Dozens of trains have also been rescheduled, or are running late, reports say.\nIndia's weather department has said that foggy conditions are likely to continue for the next few days.\nDense fog is common at this time of the year in Delhi and other parts of northern India, as the region grapples with an intense cold wave.\nPhotos and videos showed several cities shrouded in dense mist and haze.\nADVERTISEMENT Around nine airports including the one in Delhi experienced zero visibility on Friday morning, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.\nThe Delhi airport has issued an advisory to passengers, warning them of significant delays.\n\"While landing and take-off continue at Delhi airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected,\" the airport said in a statement, referring to the radar system that enables automatic landings when there is very low visibility.\nSeveral airlines have also issued statements urging travellers to check flight schedules before planning their journeys.\nIMD considers fog \"dense\" if visibility drops below 200m and \"very dense\" if it falls below 50m.\nThe weather department has said that Delhi may experience light to moderate rainfall on 6 January, which is likely to further lower temperatures.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram , YouTube , Twitter and Facebook",

    "text": "- Researchers report that the psychoactive drug ibogaine seems to promote both structural and psychological improvements in brain health. - In a study, veterans who used the drug reported decreases in PTSD, anxiety, and depression as well as improvements in brain function. - The precise mechanism by which ibogaine works to treat TBI remains unclear, however. A relatively obscure psychoactive drug could hold promise for treating [traumatic brain injuries](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/179837) (TBI), according to a new [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02705-w) Researchers from Stanford University in California report that the plant-based psychoactive drug [ibogaine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ibogaine-for-addicition), when combined with magnesium to protect the heart, can safely and effectively reduce [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/156285) (PTSD), [anxiety](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323454), and [depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933) as well as improve functioning in veterans with TBI. The drug seems to increase the brain’s ability to heal itself after suffering traumatic injuries, which can result in both structural and functional changes in brain function, according to [Dr. Nolan Williams](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/nolan-williams), a study author and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford. “There is a physical effect and a psychological effect,” Williams told Medical News Today. The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, focused on a group of 30 Gulf War veterans who had sought ibogaine treatment at a clinic in Mexico. Treatment with [ibogaine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ibogaine#:~:text=Ibogaine%20is%20classified%20like%20heroin,Kingdom%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Germany.), which is derived from an African shrub called iboga, is legal in Mexico and Canada but illegal in the United States, where it has been classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a schedule I controlled substance since 1970. The 30 special operations veterans all had clinically significant levels of disability related to a history of TBI and repeated blast exposures. Researchers reported that treatment with ibogaine reduced the veterans’ average rating on a disability assessment scale from about 30 — equivalent to mild to moderate disability — to about 5 one month after treatment, indicating no disability. Participants also experienced average reductions of 88% in PTSD symptoms, 87% in depression symptoms, and 81% in anxiety symptoms. The researchers added that cognitive testing further revealed improvements in participants’ concentration, information processing, memory, and impulsivity. “No other drug has ever been able to alleviate the functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms of traumatic brain injury,” said Williams in a [statement](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/01/ibogaine-ptsd.html). [Dr. John Krystal](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/john-krystal/), the chair of Yale University’s Department of Psychiatry in Connecticut as well as a professor of psychiatry, neuroscience, and psychology who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today that the findings “are very encouraging in suggesting the possibility of achieving significant improvement across many neuropsychiatric symptom domains from a single ibogaine treatment.” “It is remarkable that response rates approached 100 percent and remission rates exceeded 80 percent,” said Krystal. “I believe [the study] justifies further research on the safety and effectiveness of ibogaine as a treatment, but it does not yet support implementation of ibogaine in clinical practice.” Krystal did point out that the study group was small, not representative of the population at large, and that researchers did not compare the findings to a control group, among other limitations to the research. “A big question complicating interpretation of the results is, ‘What is the nature of the pathology that is responding to ibogaine?,’” he added. “We can’t tell from this study whether symptoms associated with TBI, PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, or substance use disorder responded particularly well to ibogaine. It could be any or all of these conditions.” “The improvement in the [cognitive disability] scores could be related to improvement in TBI, but it also could be related to improvement in PTSD and depression, both of which are associated with cognitive and functional impairment,” explained Krystal. “Thus, although all of the patients had TBI, we cannot infer that ibogaine is an effective treatment for TBI from this study.” Williams agreed, telling Medical News Today that “nobody really knows” how ibogaine works, although he said the drug seems to improve neuroplasticity — the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. This action could be related to [ibogaine’s known effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6411846/) Many U.S. military veterans have [sustained](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501743/) These injuries are believed to play a role in depression and suicide among military veterans. The Stanford study was conducted in partnership with [VETS Inc.](https://vetsolutions.org/), a foundation that helps facilitate psychedelic-assisted therapies for veterans. “There were a handful of veterans who had gone to this clinic in Mexico and were reporting anecdotally that they had great improvements in all kinds of areas of their lives after taking ibogaine,” Williams said. “Our goal was to characterize those improvements with structured clinical and neurobiological assessments.” Stanford researchers reported that study participants had no serious side effects from the ibogaine therapy. Magnesium was included in the treatment regimen to preclude the known risk of ibogaine use causing cardiac arrhythmia, said Williams. However, [Lea McMahon](https://www.symetriarecovery.com/author/dr-mcmahon/#:~:text=Lea%20McMahon%20LPC%2C%20EdD%20is,of%20psychology%20at%20Columbia%20College.), a licensed professional counselor and the chief clinical officer at Symetria Recovery, which operates addiction treatment centers in Illinois and Texas, cautioned that while ibogaine is not considered to be physically addictive, “there is still a risk of misuse which can have serious consequences.” “Self-administration is potentially dangerous and it’s important to remember that this is a controlled substance which has yet to be approved for therapeutic treatment in many countries,” McMahon, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. McMahon called for a “measured approach” in using ibogaine to treat brain disorders or other conditions. “Although there is evidence which suggests ibogaine can be helpful for supporting recovery from substance or alcohol use disorders, the majority of this is anecdotal,” she noted. “Ibogaine has been known to cause adverse reactions and cardiac problems, and in some cases has been linked to unexplained deaths.” Planned followup research at Stanford will include analysis of brain scans and other data collected during the study that could shed further light on how ibogaine improved brain function. Williams said the study findings indicate that the drug also could play a role in treating other neuropsychiatric conditions. “I think it targets a whole host of different brain areas and can help us better understand how to treat other forms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression that aren’t necessarily linked to TBI,” he said. Krystal cited a “significant need for treatments to address the functional impact of TBI.” “Even mild traumatic brain injuries, like head injuries that are associated with only a brief loss of consciousness, can produce functional impairments, including pain and cognitive impairment,” he said. “With more severe injury, more severe functional and cognitive impairments are seen, along with complication, including epilepsy.” Currently, TBI treatment includes medications such as antidepressants for mood symptoms, stimulants for cognitive impairments, and anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants for seizures and pain, according to Krystal. Other psychedelic drugs, such as [psilocybin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/308850) and [ketamine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/302663), also appear to have the ability to “stimulate the restoration of synaptic connections in neurons that are otherwise viable,” noted Krystal. “Ibogaine is a very complicated drug [that] acts on many neural targets in the brain,” he said. “The mechanisms through which ibogaine acts appear to overlap somewhat with psychedelics and ketamine, as well as [MDMA](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/297064), although the list of potential brain targets is quite large… While [ibogaine] might work for symptoms associated with a wide range of diagnoses, in order to become an FDA-approved treatment, it needs to be shown to be safe and effective for specific diagnostic groups [like] TBI, PTSD, depression, alcohol use disorder, etc.”",

    "text": "The Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) has made significant progress throughout the year 2023. The organisation has successfully ventured into new geographies while maintaining robust business growth. During the last 12 months, IRS enlarged its fleet by adding more than 5 million GT and expanding its global reach with new customers from Middle East, Europe & Asia Pacific.\nIRS has been closely associated with key technology demonstration projects in collaboration with various Indian shipyards. The projects include hydrogen fuel cells, autonomous vessels, as well as a remote-controlled vessel. All projects are in advanced stages of construction and expected to be completed by early to mid-2024.\nAs part of IRS’ commitment in providing efficient and environmentally friendly propulsion solutions, it has been selected by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to provide classification services for six hybrid electric catamarans with Lithium-Titanium Oxide (LTO) batteries and diesel generators in a hybrid mode to power propulsion motors and other systems aboard the ships. IRS is also working with a Europe based owner for classification of a methanol dual fuelled ship to be constructed in India.\nIRS has updated its ‘Rules for Construction and Classification of Indian Naval Ships in the year 2023 which includes the most recent IMO/IACS requirements, as well as military design features. This year saw the launching of two Diving Support Vessels, two Diving Support Crafts, four ASW-SWC vessels, successful delivery of first Survey Vessel Large, INS Sandhayak, and five specialised barges for carriage of Missiles, Torpedo and Ammunition.\nAs a testimony of growing confidence of shipyards in the technical and professional competence of IRS, Cochin Shipyard is building six New Generation Missile Vessels, GSL will build seven New Generation Naval OPVs, Floating Dock for Sri Lankan Navy, GRSE would be building four New Generation Naval OPVs, HSL building five Fleet Support Ships and L&T building three Cadet Training Ships all under IRS Classification. The organisation is also involved with various new construction projects of Indian Coast Guard including eight Fast Patrol Vessels and two Pollution Control Vessels. IRS has also demonstrated technical capabilities to carry out stealth studies of Naval vessels which were previously done outside the country.\nTo achieve digital transformation and improve operational efficiency, IRS entered a strategic partnership with Dassault Systèmes to use virtual twin technology. The Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform will enable IRS to enhance and implement data-driven decision-making processes across a variety of stages, including concept design, engineering, integrated operations, and maintenance. The platform will also facilitate vessel lifecycle management, provide digital services through a unified platform, and provide end-to-end digital traceability and is likely to go live by Q3/Q4 of 2024.\nMr Arun Sharma, Executive Chairman, Indian Register of Shipping\nIRS participated in key international maritime events, demonstrating its commitment to the industry. It hosted the 6th Singapore Advisory Committee meeting and Customer Meet, apart from a presence at the Sea Asia exhibition during Singapore Maritime Week 2023. During London International Shipping Week in September, IRS organised a round table discussion on ‘Seascape 2030 – Decarbonisation and the Human Element’ with distinguished speakers, as well as a Technical Seminar. IRS MD Mr. Vijay Arora spoke on “Sustainable Ship Design and Construction” at The Maritime Standard Transportation and Climate Change Conference at Abu Dhabi.\nMr Vijay Arora, MD said ’Going forward, IRS will continue to focus on enhancing fleet quality, strengthen surveyors’ capability through regular training and expand its presence in new geographies. It is our steadfast commitment to excellence, quality, and maritime safety that gives us an unrivalled reputation.’\nMr Arun Sharma, Executive Chairman of IRS said: “In 2023, IRS saw remarkable growth and reinforced its position as a trusted maritime partner. As we approach 2024, global regulatory shifts will continue to accelerate, particularly in response to IMO emission reduction targets for 2030. IRS is prepared to handle these changes seamlessly as companies intensify efforts to meet these targets. While contributing to global initiatives, IRS also aligns with India’s ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ campaign, solidifying our position as a beacon of reliability for maritime stakeholders worldwide.”\nSource: Indian Register of Shipping (IRS)\n2023-12-29 hellenicshippingnews...",

    "title": "Cold-Case Investigator Turns to Science to Disprove Christ's Resurrection, Gets Shocked by the Evidence | CBN News",
    "text": "GREENSBORO, N.C.— When atheists find evidence of Jesus' Resurrection and become believers, you know there must be more than just faith that it happened. Two of the most famous former atheists came to a Truth for a New Generation conference outside of this North Carolina city to talk about how they ended up strong defenders of the fact Christ really did rise from the dead.\nAs a successful cold-case detective, J. Warner Wallace became so well known at solving decades-old murders, he ended up as the foremost expert on national TV true crime shows.\nBut as an atheist, he decided to turn his superior detective skills on disproving the Resurrection of Jesus Christ…or even proving it if the evidence should somehow take him there.\nHe remembered telling himself, \"I'm going to have to figure out how to evaluate that for its truthfulness given this skill set that I had as a cold case detective.\"\nCBN News talked to him at this crowded conference where hundreds of people gathered to hear Wallace and others tell their stories and learn how their faith in Christ rests on solid evidence.\nTackling Theories Against the Resurrection\nFor years some doubters clung to one theory that Jesus didn't actually die on the cross but was just nearly dead and revived later.\nWallace points out that when you work with dead bodies all the time like he has and people in Christ's time did, you can definitely tell \"dead\" from \"nearly dead.\"\n\"As a homicide detective, I'm thinking 'I've seen a lot of dead people, and I know what dead people look like,'\" he said, and then talked about something called \"the mortise triad.\"\n\"That hot blood's going to stop circulating, you're going to cool down. That's called algor mortis,\" he stated. \"You'll be cool to the touch. And we can actually judge time of death based on how cool.\"\nJesus Really Was Dead\nThis author of Cold-Case Christianity moved on, saying, \"This is something I've seen my entire career: there's the thing called rigor mortis. It's the second of the mortise triad. And you'll see that kind of stiffness. You won't be as flexible as you would be if you were just unconscious.\"\nWarner finds in the Gospel of John a key point of proof that Jesus wasn't faking it and that He really did die: a line about blood and water coming out of Jesus' body on the cross when a Roman soldier pierced him with a spear.\n\"Water will collect in your lungs,\" he explained. \"Now if that happens, if you pierce that cavity, you will see a separation of blood and water.\"\nIt struck Wallace powerfully that John wrote of this, saying, \"He was either so clever that he included some little-known biological fact that nobody would discover for 1800 years or he just reported what he saw. And as a result, we have a good piece of hidden science that confirms that Jesus actually died of cardiac arrest and was dead at the point of the body being taken off the cross.\"\nAs a young atheist, Josh McDowell set off to write Evidence That Demands a Verdict to show the evidence about Christ, including His Resurrection, was so weak, the verdict would be \"Not True.\"\n\"The Resurrection was one of several things I knew I had to refute as a non-believer,\" McDowell recalled.\nHow Could He Move? Or Roll Away the Stone?\nBut instead of refuting, he became so convinced it happened, he spends dozens of pages in Evidence That Demands a Verdict knocking down false theories, like the one suggesting Christ didn't really die but woke up and escaped from the tomb.\n\"There were a hundred and some pounds of encasement of aromatic spices and gumming of cement consistency around His body, wrapped tightly in three separate linen cloths weighing about 117 pounds,\" McDowell told CBN News.\nHe continued, \"Christ was encased in that, and it becomes hardened. Second, how would He be able to move in such a state like that a one-and-a-half to two-ton stone away from the entrance?\"\nDid the Disciples Steal the Body?\nAs for the theory His disciples stole the body, the Jewish leaders opposed to Jesus were so worried about that exact thing happening, they talked the Romans into putting a massive guard group — as many as 16 soldiers — outside the tomb.\nMcDowell scoffed, \"The impossibility of that! That they could have climbed through there, tiptoed around all the guards and become invisible to the guards in front of the tomb, rolled a one-and-a-half to two-ton stone that in that day that they said 20 men couldn't move it.\"\nWallace can't accept this was all just a conspiracy because detectives know those often fall apart when there are too many conspirators and the people involved face real threats if they don't recant.\nHe pointed out, \"And we don't have a single, ancient record of any of the disciples ever recanting when that was often the goal of the people who were persecuting Christians.\"\nWallace pointed out courts don't expect the law to prove absolutely no possible doubt. Only no reasonable doubt.\n\"So is it possible that they conspired for 60 years, at 500 plus people, under immense pressure with not enough family relationships to hold it together?\" Wallace asked. \"Yeah, it's possible. It's just not reasonable.\"\nJesus Appeared to All Sorts of People\nDebunkers say Jesus in the biblical accounts only showed up to his closest followers, those most likely to lie about His Resurrection. But McDowell said the opposite is true.\n\"He appeared to the Apostle Paul, Saul of Tarsus, who was anything but a follower of Christ. He despised Christ as a false Messiah,\" McDowell said.\nHe also pointed out Jesus appeared to James, saying, \"You take James, His brother. James was not a follower of Jesus Christ. He was embarrassed by Christ, his brother, going out and doing these things and claiming these things. But James ended up coming to Christ and became a leader of the Jerusalem church.\"\nNo Two People – Much Less 500 – Have the Same Hallucination\nThe Bible talks about Christ after His Resurrection showing up before 500 people. Some debunkers say that was likely just a mass hallucination. Neither Wallace or McDowell buy that.\nMcDowell interviewed five experts and learned, \"No two people ever have the same hallucination because there's no external reference to it. It's all internal.\"\nWallace added, \"There's just no history of kind of group hallucinations with the kind of detail that we see in the gospels. So I was never fond of that explanation.\"\nWorshipping Jesus\nMcDowell stated, \"In my research to refute Christianity, I became convinced the Church would never have been founded without the Resurrection. Everything that they did pointed back to that.\"\nOne huge thing they did: break the Sabbath and worship Jesus as they did it. Remember: all the early believers were fervent Jews who had believed they faced dire danger if they broke the Sabbath.\nAlex McFarland – who organized this Truth for a New Generation conference – points out how that changed right after Jesus' Resurrection.\n\"Pious Jews whose very relationship with God is contingent on keeping a Sabbath that they've observed for centuries, suddenly overnight begin to worship on Sunday. Why? Something must have happened. Well, Sunday was Resurrection day.\"\n\"Now you have to understand what it meant to the Jew if they ever broke the Sabbath,\" McDowell explained. \"It could mean death.\"\nThe Resurrection Proves It All\nBut the Resurrection on a Sunday had been the proof positive that Jesus was indeed the Risen Lord, worthy of worship on that day of the week.\n\"If Christ physically rose from the grave, then that proves His identity, message, and credentials,\" McFarland pointed out. \"What was His identity? God Incarnate. What was His message? Salvation by faith in what He did on the cross. His credentials? Virgin-born, sinless life, rose from the dead, i.e.: He is the Savior.\"\nMcDowell told CBN News the meaning of it all is so powerful and overwhelming, it still touches him deeply more than half a century after he first came to believe Jesus was indeed the Resurrected Son of God, able to conquer death.\n\"It gives me hope that as Christ was raised from the dead, I shall be, too. Because of that,\" he stated.\nMcFarland added, \"In the empty tomb, we have it all, ironclad, guaranteed. I tell people the tomb was left empty so that your life could be made full.\"\nShare This article",
