    "text": "Dan Levy reveals true story behind Good Grief sex toy scene\nDan Levy has spilled the true story from his 20s that inspired the hysterical sex toy scene in his new Netflix film Good Grief.\nLevy’s\ndebut feature film is a beautifully devastating look at starting fresh after unimaginable heartbreak, and the chosen family who help us through – but it’s not without its laugh-out-loud moments.\nFor example, one scene sees Levy’s character Marc and his friends Sophie (Ruth Negga) and Thomas (Himesh Patel) reflect on his bizarre discovery when he first moved into his London flat.\nMarc smiles and reminds his friends that it was a “homemade dildo”, seemingly left behind by the previous tenants, that he had found, inciting squeals and chuckles from Sophie and Thomas.\nIt turns out that that really did happen to Levy when he first moved to London in the early 2000s.\nIn an interview with\nNetflix, the Canadian actor spoke about how his time in London inspired different elements of his directorial film debut.\nYou may like to watch\n“I have a lot of very fond memories of London. I lived here in my early 20s,” he recalled.\n“In fact, there’s a story that made its way into the movie that I wrote for the three of us to reminisce on.”\nSitting next to co-star, Himesh Patel, he explains: “I think I was 20 and I found an apartment. I was cleaning the apartment and I pulled the bed out from the wall and I felt something thump behind the bed , and I didn’t have my cleaning gloves on but I thought it was the bottle of cleaning solution.\n“And I went to reach for it – this is an inappropriate conversation – but I went to reach for it and I felt something phallic in nature slip out of my hands.\n“I looked over the bed and it was a perfume bottle that someone had wrapped in a condom to, I suppose, enjoy themselves with. And that was my first real London memory and I’ve loved it ever since!”\nThe Schitts Creek star had previously spoken about this unsettling discovery in a 2021 interview with\n Metro.\nLevy explained that he had moved from Canada to London shortly after leaving college in 2005, and resided in the city for six or seven months in the hopes of getting some space from a “tricky romantic situation”.\n“I always had a highly romanticised fascination with England,” he said at the time. “Notting Hill and Bridget Jones are my favourite movies.”\nWhen it comes to romance, Levy has shared that he tends to have more luck in the UK.\nSpeaking to the\nTable Manners podcast, the actor revealed that he’s certain he’s “going to find love” in London.\n“I had the best time,” he told hosts Jessie and Lennie Ware.\n“I date a lot in England, but I don’t date a lot in America. I don’t quite know why but I have to go back [to London] because that’s where I’ve had the most successful dates. It’s where I’m going to find love.”\nIn Good Grief, Levy plays Marc, who is learning to start anew after his husband (played by Luke Evans) dies in a car accident.\nAfter making a shocking discovery about his late husband, Marc takes friends Thomas and Sophie with him to Paris to unpack a devastating secret about the man he loved.\nGood Grief is available to stream now on Netflix.\nMyPinkNews members are invited to comment on articles to discuss the content we publish, or debate issues more generally.

    "text": "IMD issues red alert for dense fog in north India as travel remains chaotic Story highlights A thick blanket of fog enveloped the national capital which led to a delay of more than a hundred flights and trains A thick blanket of fog enveloped the national capital which led to a delay of more than a hundred flights and trains The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for dense fog which has blanketed parts of north India in the past few days – especially Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh. “Dense Fog Advisory for Punjab, Haryana, Delhi Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan and north Madhya Pradesh: Be careful while driving or outing through any transport. Use fog lights while driving. Be in touch with airlines, railways, and state transport for your journey schedule,\" wrote the weather office on social media platform X. The national capital remained covered with a thick blanket of fog which led to a delay of more than a hundred flights as the visibility remained low in the national capital. The Delhi airport on Thursday (Dec 28) reported that nearly 134 domestic and international flights were delayed, and 35 international departures and 28 international arrivals remained affected. Meanwhile, there were delays in 43 domestic departures and 28 domestic arrivals on Friday (Dec 28). The New Delhi Railway Station also faced a similar situation when 22 trains were delayed which left passengers stranded in the biting cold.

Even though there was little improvement, the air quality continued to remain in the \"very poor\" category for the next two days. “The reason the fog situation saw some improvement on Thursday was due to overnight winds in several areas. The wind speed on Wednesday night reached up to 8 kmph, so the fog dissipated. However, on Friday the wind speed will drop,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist with India Meteorological Department (IMD), while speaking to The Times Of India. “We have issued the red warning for Friday, suggesting that the time between 4 am to 10 am could see accidents as visibility will be very low. So, unless it’s very essential, do not take out your vehicle at this time,” Srivastava added. Meanwhile, the IMF issued an orange alert for dense to moderate fog on Saturday (Dec 30). trending now Air quality likely to deteriorate further The Met department on Thursday (Dec 28) released INSAT imagery in which a dense fog layer was seen over north India, which affected the regions in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and northwest Madhya Pradesh. The dense fog created low visibility conditions in these regions which led to traffic disruptions and accidents. Extending its warning, the IMD predicted dense fog over Punjab and Haryana for the next five days. For the next three days, Uttar Pradesh is likely to witness dense fog due to which guidelines have been issued by the UP State Road Transport Corporation for bus operations in low visibility conditions. Watch: Intense cold wave continues in North India, red alert issued in several states due to fog An advisory was issued by the Delhi Airport Authority in which it was said that flights, which are not compliant with CAT III standards, are likely to face disruptions. Further, potential health risks related to dense fog were also highlighted by the IMD, which emphasised the presence of pollutants and particulate matter which can adversely affect respiratory health. “Weather conditions are not favourable for effective dispersion of pollutants. Emissions from firecrackers if burnt on December 31 will further deteriorate air quality… The predominant surface wind is likely to be from the east-southeast direction in Delhi-NCR with a wind speed of 6-4 kmph with partly cloudy sky with dense to very dense fog at most places in the morning on December 29,” predicted the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's air quality early warning system.

Dopo i primi 10 giorni di piogge intense e vento, grazie alla rimonta dell'alta pressione, tornano il sole e le temperature miti su tutta l'Italia. A confermare l'arrivo dell'ottobrata Antonio Sanò, fondatore de iLMeteo.it. \"Nelle prossime ore - afferma - avremo ancora qualche residuo addensamento specie sul Triveneto orientale, in Toscana e sul Basso Tirreno, accompagnato da locali piovaschi. Per il resto il tempo sarà in deciso miglioramento ovunque\". Le temperature scenderanno leggermente a causa di venti più freschi dai quadranti settentrionali, specie al meridione ed in Sardegna, ma in complesso il clima sarà mite. Nel weekend sono previste giornate soleggiate eccetto sul nordovest, dove permangono correnti più umide, e in montagna, con addensamenti che comunque non causeranno precipitazioni. Lungo le coste le massime toccheranno 28°C in Sardegna e Sicilia, fino a 27°C in Puglia e Calabria, 25-26°C in Basilicata con Napoli e Roma a 24°C, Firenze a 22°C e Milano sui 20. Nel dettaglio: - Venerdì 11. Al nord: piovaschi sui monti emiliani, sole altrove. Al centro: piovaschi sulla Toscana interna. Al sud: nubi residue con locali piovaschi sulle tirreniche. - Sabato 12. Al nord: nuvoloso. Al centro: soleggiato. Al sud: soleggiato. - Domenica 13. Al nord: sole prevalente. Al centro: soleggiato.

    "text": "A mum-of-two is one step closer to being Australia's first female astronaut. $1/ (min cost $8) Login or signup to continue reading [Australian Space Agency](/story/8449301/) employee Katherine Bennell-Pegg announced she was halfway through her year-long training at the European Astronaut Centre in Germany. While other Australian women have trained to go to space, they've always done so under the flags of other countries. Ms Bennell-Beg and her family relocated to Europe for the intensive training process. More than 22,000 people applied to the coveted position in hopes of becoming an astronaut candidate. The job requires rigorous physical training, as well as a year of intensive study. \"I have always dreamed of being an astronaut,\" she said. \"When I was young, it was for the adventure but after more than a decade working in space it's now because I know the role it plays in tackling real-world problems.\" The next six months are expected to include intense exercise, sea survival, studying space station robotic arm simulations and centrifuge training. \"We need to know the basics around medical procedures - not just in case something goes wrong, but because astronauts are basically medical guinea pigs,\" she told the [ Australian Space Agency](/story/8338233/). \"In space, as your body adapts to weightlessness any medical issues you may have on Earth - such as osteoporosis, or muscle degradation - are put on fast forward and we can support research on that.\" The Adelaide-born astronaut candidate previously served as Director of Space Technology at the Australian Space Agency, and as part of the space robotics and automation team. In early December, Ms Bennell-Pegg travelled to the United States where she underwent specialised training with NASA in Houston and met with Australian Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd in Washington DC. \"I'm excited - not just for me - but for what my training and experience can unlock for Australian scientists, engineers and operators, and all the value that can bring,\" she said.

    "text": "Max George revealed he was preparing for surgery when he shared a photo from his hospital bed on Thursday.\nThe Wanted star, 36, has been in hospital for a week with a 2:1 atrioventricular block and recently revealed he will now undergo emergency surgery sooner than expected because his heart rate ‘hasn’t increased’.\nMax told fans about his surgery on Thursday when he revealed he was being prepared for surgery by medics.\nWhile sharing a cut of his arm in his hospital bed, Max could be seen being given medication before surgery.\nMax got a boost ahead of his operation when he was visited by his girlfriend Maisie Smith in hospital.\nTaking to her Instagram Stories, the former EastEnders actress shared a photo holding his hand in hospital and wrote: ‘Got to see my amazing husband today. [heart emoji]. Proud of you @maxgeorge.’\nMax George revealed he was preparing for surgery when he shared a photo from his hospital bed on Thursday\nMax told fans about his surgery on Thursday when he revealed he was being prepared for surgery by medics\nMax got a boost ahead of his surgery when he was visited by his girlfriend Maisie Smith in hospital (pictured in 2023)\nMax reposted the image and added: ‘Thanks honey. I love you so much.’\nMax and Maisie were first linked in the summer of 2022 when they were spotted kissing on a flight to Crete, after reportedly bonding on the Strictly live tour, after meeting for the first time in 2020 starred in the show.\nMaisie moved in with Max at the beginning of last year and since then the two have been busy renovating their dream home.\nShe has supported the star through his health crisis, with Max revealing on Monday that, after a full chest scan, he might be able to have surgery ‘much sooner’ and be home for the holidays.\nSharing an update on Instagram, Max was seen in a hospital gown in the back of an ambulance.\nHe wrote: ‘Had a little day out today. Full cat scan of my heart. Not something I would choose again!\n‘As I said yesterday, I have a 2:1 block in my heart. Unfortunately, my heart rate hasn’t improved at all for almost a week.’\nMax added: ‘This doesn’t give us as much time to wait, so it looks like I’ll be operated on much sooner than the doctors initially thought. I might even be home for Christmas!\nThe Wanted star, 36, has been in hospital for a week and is suffering from a 2:1 atrioventricular block\nHe recently revealed he will now undergo emergency surgery sooner than expected because his heart rate ‘hasn’t increased’\nMax revealed on Monday that he will undergo emergency surgery earlier than expected because his heart rate ‘hasn’t increased’\n‘It’s still quite a scary time at the moment and the last few nights have been very tough, but I wanted to say that I am absolutely humbled by all your messages of support.\n‘Both people I know and people I don’t know. It has given me a much-needed boost and my family has been overwhelmed with support, which means more to me than anything.”\nAtrioventricular block is a condition that occurs when electrical impulses are delayed or blocked from reaching the ventricles.\nThe cause is a ‘mystery’ and Max, who has battled alcoholism in the past, previously said: ‘We canceled a few things, like alcohol for example. six months, so that’s not it’.\nHe told his followers: ‘Hope you’re having a good night, I spoke to the nurse earlier and the good news is I’m getting a scan sooner than I thought.’\n“So that’s really good, and it’s called a 2:1 block, that’s what we know at this point. We’re going to try to determine the cause before we determine how we treat it, whether it’s a pacemaker, defibrillator or something else.”\nLooking on the bright side, he joked: ‘So there I am, feeling good tonight, the City game didn’t help much’ – after his beloved Manchester City lost to United.\nA pacemaker is a small battery-powered device that prevents the heart from beating too slowly. It requires surgery to install it and is usually performed under local anesthesia.\nFollowing his health problems last week, Max shared on Instagram: ‘Hey everyone, Yesterday I felt very unwell and was taken to hospital. Unfortunately, after some tests they discovered that I have problems with my heart.’\n‘I have many more tests to determine the extent of the problems and what surgery I will need to get back on my feet.\nIn a health update, he explained that after a full chest scan he might be able to have surgery “much sooner” and be home for the holidays.\nHe wrote: ‘Had a little day out today. Full cat scan of my heart. Not something I would want to do again!…Unfortunately my heart rate hasn’t increased at all for almost a week’\n‘It’s going to be a tough few weeks/months… and Christmas in a hospital bed wasn’t exactly what I had planned!\n‘But as always I am surrounded with love and support by my amazing partner Maisie, her family, my family and friends… and I am 100% in the best place.\n‘While this is a huge shock and undoubtedly a setback, it is something I will face with everything I have! I consider myself very lucky that this was caught when it did.\nHe added: “Apologies if I bore you with updates in the coming weeks. I’ve probably been in bed for a month and there’s not THAT much to do! Let’s do this! Lots of love, Max x’\nShortly after his announcement, Max posted a light-hearted joke from his hospital bed about Manchester City’s loss in Wednesday night’s football match.\nAs he lay in bed with a heart monitor on his chest, he joked: “So I think they’re officially trying to kill me… come on guys.”\nMax has been open about his battle with binge drinking and alcoholism over the years, previously admitting to drinking ‘ten pints and three bottles of wine in one night’.",

    "title": "MaiaSpace set to forge Europe's path to reusability",
    "text": "French company MaiaSpace has a good shot at becoming the first European launch provider to bring reusable orbital vehicles to the market. The company is firmly on the path to achieving this by leveraging existing technologies and optimizing its design decisions around the vehicle while remaining competitive.\nNSF spoke with MaiaSpace’s CEO, Yohann Leroy, about the company’s forthcoming launcher, which is due to take its maiden flight next year.\n“Our mission is to bring to the launch pad, in four years, the first European reusable and eco-responsible mini launcher,” Leroy told NSF. The vehicle, called Maia, will be able to launch payloads ranging from 500 kg to 4,000 kg, depending on the target orbit. The first stage will land at sea on a barge for recovery and reuse, similar to SpaceX’s Falcon rockets.\nThe four-year goal set by the company would see the first Maia vehicle launch in 2026. The fast pace of development is made possible by adopting some pre-existing European technologies. “Our idea is not to reinvent the wheel but to use the technologies that have been developed here and there in Europe,” Leroy adds.\nOne year into the project, prototypes of the main aspects of the vehicle were already undergoing testing, adding credibility to the likelihood of reaching its launch target. In June 2023, cryogenic tests were being performed on the first and second stages while ArianeGroup was simultaneously conducting test firings of its Prometheus engine demonstrator. This engine was already well advanced when MaiaSpace was created and was a natural choice for the new vehicle. “If we had decided to develop the engine ourselves,” explains Leroy, “there would be no way for us to be on the launch pad in 2026.”\nA subsidiary of ArianeGroup, MaiaSpace was created in 2022. It is a French company that considers its DNA to be European, with over half of its partners coming from outside of France. “What we are trying to do is combine the best of two worlds. We are a startup company, but we are also a spin-off from the ArianeGroup,” Leroy says.\nThe separation from ArianeGroup as a self-funded private company enables MaiaSpace to be autonomous and free to make decisions outside of the constraints of the group. “The development of our rocket is not funded with public money, but we can draw from the experience and expertise of the mother company,” Leroy points out. “There are people who have been developing rockets for 40 or 50 years, and that can help us make the right choices and avoid making mistakes.”\nSome inspiration was taken from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Themis demonstrator, which was also on the test stand during the early development of the Maia prototype stages. Themis serves primarily to test and validate technologies for first-stage reusability under the auspices of ESA. With the expectation of the project eventually contributing to the Ariane program, the Maia vehicle benefits early by being derived from some of that work.\nReusability has been baked into Maia’s design from the outset, and the company expects to conduct two or three flights to demonstrate control over the first stage before attempting to land on a barge. Functionality such as the stage flip and engine reignition will be proven on these initial flights ahead of a first landing and recovery attempt around 2028. Similar to a Falcon 9, the Maia vehicle has landing legs and grid fins for guidance back to its landing target.\n“Sometimes the strategy of some other launch operators is to change the design of their rocket to introduce reusability at a later stage,” notes Leroy. “In our view, this is suboptimal – you need to take this into account right from the beginning. By design, our rocket will be reusable, and we will progressively demonstrate this capability during the ramp-up.”\nThe rocket will launch from the converted ELS Soyuz pad at the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG), or Guiana Space Center, in Kourou, French Guiana. The location affords a wide angle of launches to the north and eastwards, benefitting from the added rotational slingshot effect of being close to Earth’s equator.\nThe spaceport is currently used by Europe’s Ariane 6 and Vega rockets, with other launch operators also planning to launch from the site in the future, including PLD Space’s Miura 5, Isar Aerospace’s Spectrum, and Rocket Factory Augsburg’s RFA One. “All this helps the economic equation,” Leroy explains, “CSG can better share fixed costs with a higher number of operators, and I truly believe this will allow us to get attractive conditions.”\nFrom an environmental and sustainability standpoint, reusing the pad meets MaiaSpace’s eco-friendly philosophy. However, the pad will still require small amounts of modification before Maia flies. Infrastructure for kerosene propellant is being upgraded to handle the bio-methane propellant, and some work needs to be done on the mechanical structure of the pad itself. Existing buildings will be repurposed, while a new transport erector is being manufactured and will arrive in the first half of next year. This will allow horizontal assembly in the former Soyuz assembly building before the vehicle is rolled out to the pad.\nThe two-stage Maia vehicle will stand 50 m tall with a diameter of 3.5 m. It will occupy a position in the market between larger medium-lift vehicles such as Falcon 9 and the smaller Electron, Alpha, Vega, and Miura 5 rockets that are approximately half its size. The vehicle can deliver 1,500 kg to a Sun-synchronous orbit when expended or 500 kg when recovering the first stage.\nAn optional third Colibri kick stage would add around 1,000 kg to both launch configurations. Missions that take advantage of the additional performance from equatorial launches to inclined low-Earth orbits will see an increase to 4,000 kg. Broadband satellite constellations typically use these orbits, inclined around 50 to 55 degrees for maximum mid-latitude coverage, and could be potential customers for the company.\nMaiaSpace consists predominantly of engineers, but the CEO is keen to emphasize that the company philosophy is driven by business thinking. “Our objective is not to extract the last kilogram of performance possible considering the size of the rocket. What we are looking for is making the launcher that will allow us to be the most competitive, considering the economies of scale do not necessarily play in our favor. When we compare ourselves to heavy launchers, performance is typically five to ten times less. In our industry, like many others, when you double the size of the rocket you typically do not double the cost to build it.”\nLeroy is mindful of the benefits and speed to orbit that have made heavier launchers the logical choice for batches of satellites to date, and Maisapace is already having positive conversations with constellation operators. “With four tonnes of performance, we believe we can fight against the lack of economies of scale and reach a cost per kilogram, or per satellite deployed, that is equivalent to what heavy launchers can propose to these constellation operators. If we succeed, we can become a solution to further increase the pace at which they can deploy their constellation. For them, it does not represent any extra cost, it’s just additional launch capabilities they can use.”\nMaiaSpace announced this month that it has signed a contract with Exotrail for multiple Spacevan servicer missions starting in 2027. The company is also in discussions with various institutional and commercial customers from Europe, Asia, and the United States.\nMaia will be powered by three Prometheus engines on the first stage and a vacuum-optimized Prometheus on the second. The Prometheus engine burns liquid bio-methane and oxygen as propellants and supports reusability through its ability to throttle, which is necessary to slow down the first stage for landings.\n“It’s easier to land if you took off with three engines than with only one,” explains Leroy. “The thrust for the landing needs to be approximately 10% of the take-off thrust, and having an engine that is capable of reducing its thrust by 90% would be a big challenge. If your thrust is generated by three engines during take-off, then you can achieve 10% of this with one engine fired up at 30% of its thrust, and that’s easier to manage.”\nReusability is the key to success for a launcher of this size and gives MaiaSpace a huge opportunity with the vehicle’s adaptable configuration. “We do not need to waste a first stage when the customer wants to be put into a specific orbit and necessitates only part of the performance of the rocket. In this situation, we can take advantage of that unused performance to get the first stage back and reduce the cost to provide the service.”\nThis approach will enable the company to remain competitive and have more opportunities to launch and learn, drawing from the benefits of a higher launch cadence. As with the Falcon 9, the landing legs and grid fins would be removed for expendable missions.\nMaiaSpace applies an agile approach, commonly used in software engineering, to build and test a minimum viable product (MVP) for each version of its designs so that it can quickly learn and iterate. The team is currently finalizing the second main model of Maia before progressing with the next and final model, which will be the flight hardware. The test campaign for an interstage has already begun on the test bench.\n“This is a specific challenge considering the rocket will be reusable and pushes us to make the separation at a lower altitude than would be the case otherwise. There’s a lot between performing cryogenic tests on the first prototype and bringing a launcher to the pad but it’s a good sign to have been able to do this in one year,” says Leroy.\nThe MVP approach means some performance decisions and ideas have been initially discarded in the interest of the schedule and reaching the launch pad on target. The vehicle won’t, for example, use condensed propellants at the super-chilled temperatures used by SpaceX on its Falcon 9. “We are ready to be simple and accept solutions that are not optimal from a performance standpoint, but once we have performed our first launches, we will seriously consider improving the performance,” notes Leroy.\nThe team has plenty of ideas that can be introduced later, thanks to its modular design. Improvements such as adding more Prometheus engines to the first stage would be much simpler than increasing the performance with technical choices that might have otherwise been specific to this particular design. One engineering tradeoff was the conclusion that stainless steel was the best option for the construction of the tanks, albeit not from a purely engineering standpoint. “Once again, our objective is not to maximize the performance of the launcher; it’s to make it as competitive as possible,” Leroy points out.\nThe company expects to ramp up to 20 flights per year towards the end of the decade and reuse its first stage boosters at least five times each. There are no immediate plans, however, to attempt fairing recovery or to return the booster for a landing on a concrete pad at the launch site. “The performance penalty would be much higher if the first stage had to return to the launch pad,” adds Leroy. “So, for the time being, the idea is to land a few hundred kilometers from the French Guiana coast on a barge at sea.”\nWhile some launch operators have larger heavy-lift vehicle concepts further down their timeline, MaiaSpace is content to focus on demonstrating the operation of the first Maia vehicle for now, which Leroy describes as “future-proof.” “With the four tonnes we can reach in an inclined orbit, we believe we can successfully address the broadband constellation [market]. We want to grasp some market share in the 500 kg satellite market and the 1.5 to three tonne [market], and by bringing them together, we will be able to make a profitable business plan.”\n(Lead image: Render of the Maia vehicle in flight.

    "text": "(CNN) – Police in a remote town in Australia removed a problem crocodile from the community on Wednesday.\nAccording to the Northern Territory Police, the crocodile terrorized the town of Bulla recently by lunging out of the water at children and eating multiple dogs.\nAfter shooting the reptile, police said they took it into town where the locals prepared it for a traditional feast.\nPolice said the 3.63 meter-long, or 11.9 foot-long, croc moved into the Baines River near residences after floods from earlier in the year.\nA community in Australia ate the crocodile that had taken several of their pets. (Norther Territory Police) Police said a crocodile safety session was also conducted by Parks and Wildlife with children to give them an up-close look at the dangers within the waterways.\n“Crocodiles can pose a significant risk to community safety,” Commander Kylie Anderson said. “Thanks to the seamless collaboration between Parks and Wildlife, our remote police staff, and local residents we were able to safely remove the large saltie and maintain the safety of the community.”\nSpeaking about the crocodile wrangling, officials added “There’s never a dull moment in remote policing.”\nCopyright 2024 CNN Newsource.

    "title": "Science-U camps celebrate 25 years",
    "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — This past summer, the Penn State Eberly College of Science’s Office of Science Outreach celebrated its 25th year of Science-U camps. Founded by Jackie Bortiatynski, director of the college’s Cada R. and Susan Wynn Grove Center for Excellence in Science Education, and her colleagues in 1990, the camps were created to give K-12 students authentic science opportunities by allowing them to interact with Penn State research and scientists, and they have served roughly 440 students every summer since.\n“Each of our Science-U camps is designed to take campers through a one-week journey that investigates an area of STEM in a fascinating and meaningful way,” said Caitlin Teti, director of the Office of Science Outreach. “Guided by our passionate staff, Science-U campers are encouraged to ask questions, think critically, and explore how science can captivate them and make a difference in their lives.”\nThroughout its 25 years, Science-U has been through many changes, but its mission has remained steadfast. The goal, Teti emphasized, is not for each child to emerge as a scientist, but rather to have gained important knowledge and a curiosity about the world around them.\nUnique to Science-U, the summer camps integrate collegiate research with elementary and high school students, allowing them to interact directly with the subject matter and faculty involved.\nAnother outstanding feature of Science-U is the interaction between campers and Penn State student staff. Campers can follow the lead of these mentors, learning about their chosen fields and career paths. The camps provide learning opportunities not only for the campers but also for the staff, who gain skills in science fields and early childhood education, as well as the chance to become leaders for the campers. Over the years, some have even made the leap from camper to staff member.\nPenn State undergraduates Layla Thornton and Sigurdur “Diddi” Steinsson were once enrolled in Science-U as campers, and since becoming Penn State students, they have decided to keep Science-U in their lives by giving back to the camps that helped shaped them and their interests.\n“My main motivation to get involved as a college student was to learn about fun science topics and to encourage campers to find what they are passionate about, as well as share my own passion for science!” said Steinsson, a second-year physics and math major.\nTwenty-five years running, Science-U continues to evolve: New camps will be featured in summer 2025, including the return of the popular \"CSI: Forensic Files” crime scene investigation camp, and a genetics-focused camp titled “Finding your Roots.” The future of Science-U, according to Teti, will consist of more partnerships, increased funding, more new camps, and additional scholarship opportunities for historically underrepresented students.\n“It’s so important to engage children at a young age, to spark their curiosity and instill in them a lifelong love of science and learning,” Bortiatynski said. “When we started the Science-U camps almost 30 years ago, we could not have imagined how popular they would become, or have foreseen the tremendous impact they would have on generations of future scientists. Looking ahead, I know we are all excited to see what amazing developments the next 25 years will bring!”\nScience-U would not be possible without support from donors, grant-making agencies, and the Eberly College of Science community; their contributions, Teti noted, are critical to Science-U's continued ability to provide K-12 students with opportunities to explore science.\n“We sincerely hope every camper comes out of their Science-U experience inspired to stay curious and keep learning!” she said.",
