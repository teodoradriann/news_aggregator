    "text": "Christmas: Church, stakeholders celebrate persons with disabilities in Lagos The Founder of lnner Eyes Foundation, Ambassador Kelly Blind, has appealed to the government and stakeholders to address the needs of persons living with disabilities. He made the call at an International Disability Day for Christ held at the Elevation Church, Lekki, Lagos. The visually-impaired and human rights activist lamented that over 21 million persons with disabilities were neglected, cheated and abandoned in government’s programmes and policies. He, therefore, urged all stakeholders to ensure that fundamental human rights of persons with disabilities were not excluded from all facets. Global Lead Pastor, The Elevation Church, Godman Akinlabi, disclosed that the church in its capacity, was reaching out to the less-privileged, including the virtually impaired in different projects through scholarships, medical treatment empowerment and training. Another visually impaired man, Mr Richard Okoroafor, who has been blind for 32 years, said they were not beggars. He lamented that they were also faced with Nigeria’s economic challenges. “ We are very hard working and productive,” he said.Ambassador and Chairman 7-Star lnter-Global Property, Moses Chukwuma Ezenwaka, urged the group to support these special persons. He advised parents, families and caregivers to show more love and care, describing the gesture as life-saving, despite these difficult times.He advocated that persons with disabilities should be empowered and afforded equal opportunities to participate in the society. Chief Executive Officer Leadway Property Ltd, Ambassador Ugo Kelechi said: “We need collective efforts assist these special people. No person should be left out our circle.” Resident Pastor, Debo Omotunde, promised to support and put smiles on the faces of special persons and the vulnerable in Lagos State. — Get the latest news delivered straight to your inbox every day of the week.

    "text": "Andrea Piacquadio/Pexels Maximizing your vehicle’s efficiency isn’t just about engine performance—your daily driving habits also influence it. Many motorists unknowingly engage in behaviors that lead to higher gas consumption, wear and tear, and reduced overall performance. Here are 15 everyday habits that could be sabotaging your vehicle’s efficiency without you even realizing it.\nIgnoring Regular Checkups Gustavo Fring/Pexels Skipping oil changes, tire rotations, and filter replacements can significantly reduce your car’s efficiency. Worn-out components and dirty fluids make your engine work harder, which inevitably decreases gas economy and causes unnecessary stress on critical systems.\nAggressive Driving Habits JÉSHOOTS/Pexels Rapid acceleration, hard braking, and excessive speeding are fuel-wasting habits. Such aggressive driving behaviors can reduce mileage even on highways and in city traffic. Smooth and gradual driving saves gas and lessens strain on your engine, brakes, and transmission.\nIdling for Long Periods shivaphotographyy/Pixabay Letting your engine idle for long wastes gas without providing any benefit. Modern engines don’t require lengthy warm-ups, even in colder weather. If you’re stopped for an extended period, like waiting in a drive-thru or during heavy traffic, consider turning off the engine to save fuel.\nDriving Short Distances Frequently Artem Podrez/Pexels Frequent short trips prevent your engine from reaching its optimal operating temperature, causing it to consume more propellant. Cold engines are less efficient and experience more wear. Consolidate errands or walk for short trips to minimize the number of cold starts.\nUsing the Wrong Motor Oil Daniel Andraski/Pexels Using motor oil with the wrong viscosity or not designed for your vehicle can decrease engine efficiency. Thicker oil than recommended creates more friction, making the engine work harder and reducing mileage economy. Always use the manufacturer-recommended motor oil to ensure smooth operation.\nOverusing the Air Conditioning Ammy K/Pexels While air conditioning is essential in hot weather, overusing it significantly affects the engine, increasing consumption. Running the A/C at full blast can decrease fuel efficiency by up to 25%. Use the fan setting or lower the windows at lower speeds whenever possible to reduce A/C dependency.\nNeglecting Aerodynamics Luke Miller/Pexels Driving with roof racks, cargo boxes, or windows down at high speeds disrupts your vehicle’s aerodynamics, forcing the engine to work harder. This decreases fuel efficiency, especially at highway speeds. Remove racks when not in use and keep windows closed on the freeway to minimize drag.\nUsing Cruise Control on Hilly Roads Anne Nygård/Unsplash Cruise control is excellent for maintaining a steady speed on flat roads but struggles on hilly terrain. It tends to over-accelerate uphill, wasting gas. Instead, manually control your speed on inclines to maintain a consistent pace and avoid unnecessary bursts of power that dent your mileage.\nDriving on Underinflated Tires Marco Antonio Casique Reyes/Pexels Underinflated tires create more rolling resistance, forcing the engine to use extra power and increasing consumption. Additionally, they can cause uneven tire wear, reducing traction and safety. Regularly check tire pressure and keep it at the manufacturer’s recommended levels.\nOverloading Your Vehicle kai62/Pixabay Carrying unnecessary weight in your vehicle can significantly impact fuel efficiency. For every extra 100 pounds, mileage drops by roughly 1%. Excess weight strains the engine, making it work harder to accelerate and maintain speed. Remove non-essential items from your car to optimize its performance.\nIgnoring Dashboard Warning Lights Erik Mclean/Pexels Dashboard warning lights indicate potential issues that could hinder your vehicle’s efficiency. Ignoring them could lead to serious mechanical problems, increased fuel consumption, or even costly repairs. Address warning lights immediately to prevent long-term damage to your car.\nUsing Low-Quality Fuel Engin Akyurt/Pexels Using cheap or low-quality gas can lead to engine deposits, reducing efficiency and performance. Such propellants may burn less cleanly, causing the engine to overwork and consume more gasoline. Always opt for high-quality fuel from reputable stations to ensure your car runs efficiently.\nUsing Circuitous Routes Yura Forrat/Pexels We all know the story, your destination is ten minutes away but you are itching for a drive so you take the longer route. Once in a while might be okay but doing this frequently will impact your tank’s numbers. Additionally, you’ll put more miles on your car faster, leading to more trips to the garage.\nSkipping Alignment and Balance Checks Artem Podrez/Pexels Poorly aligned or imbalanced wheels cause uneven tire wear and reduce efficiency by increasing rolling resistance. Misalignment also affects handling, making it harder to steer. Regularly align your wheels to ensure smooth rides, improve mileage, and extend your wheels’ lifespan.\nRiding the Brakes Mario Amé/Pexels By resting your foot on the brake or using it excessively can cause brake drag. This decreases efficiency and wears down the braking system. This habit forces the engine to work harder to maintain speed. Instead, keep a safe distance and anticipate stops to reduce unnecessary braking.",

    "text": "With incoming thunderstorms Tuesday night, the National Weather Service issued a severe weather advisory anticipating damaging wind gusts. According to meteorologist Brett Albright, a line of storms will move through Georgia late Tuesday through Wednesday morning, bringing strong winds which could knock down trees across the county. For Cobb, the storm will be strongest between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. Wednesday with wind gusts reaching between 30 and 40 mph. \"The main hazard is going to be straight line wind gusts,\" Albright said. \"The other thing to note is that it's going to be pretty breezy even before the thunderstorms get in ... We're going to see winds that may knock down a few isolated trees in the area.\" Albright said peak wind gusts as high as 60 mph are also possible for areas throughout Cobb. With these strong winds, there is a \"very small chance\" of brief tornadoes forming throughout the night. As far as rain potential, the county could receive anywhere between half an inch to one inch of rain by the end of the night, according to the NWS. By Wednesday morning, Albright said most of the effects from the storm should be gone. Until then, the NWS advises residents to use a weather radio or have Emergency Alert System notifications turned on their smartphones to ensure all necessary warnings are received. \"Have a method by which you can receive notifications throughout the night,\" Albright said. \"I know it sucks when the warning goes off and wakes you up at 2 in the morning ... but it's better to be safe than sorry.\" Get today’s headlines delivered to your email box free.",

    "text": "China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States have pledged to expand their agricultural cooperation to address global climate change and food security crises, and alleviate poverty, according to speakers at the third China-CELAC Ministerial Forum on Agriculture.\nThe two-day forum, which began on Tuesday in Weifang, Shandong province, brought together 290 participants from 25 countries, including officials from agricultural departments, ambassadors and representatives from agricultural research institutions and enterprises.\nSpeakers highlighted the strong complementarity in agriculture between China and CELAC countries, citing differences in agricultural product demand, resource allocation, capital markets and technological regulation.\n\"Agriculture is an important area for deepening cooperation between China and the CELAC countries,\" Han Jun, Party chief of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said in a video speech to the forum.\nChina has established bilateral agricultural cooperation mechanisms with 19 CELAC countries, bringing more high-quality agricultural products into Chinese households, Han said. Products such as soybeans, corn, beef, lamb, squid, cherries, avocados, coffee and wine from CELAC countries have become popular in the Chinese market.\nBilateral agricultural trade between China and CELAC countries now exceeds $81 billion, double the amount in 2014, according to the ministry. Han called for the expansion of agricultural trade between the two parties, with the aim of doubling the current trade volume in the next decade.\nAngel Manero Campos, Peru's minister of agricultural development and irrigation, said at the forum that more products from Peru will reach the Chinese market in a shorter time and fresher condition after the Chancay Port in Peru begins operations in November.\nManero noted China's remarkable achievements in various sectors compared to 10 years ago when he first visited the country. He has also observed China's growing emphasis on environmentally friendly and low-carbon agricultural production methods during field visits.\nAhead of the forum's opening ceremony, attendees visited agricultural sites in Weifang. The city's comprehensive pilot zone for agriculture, approved by the State Council, boasts strengths in agricultural machinery, seed cultivation, agricultural product processing and rural area management and development.\n\"Weifang takes pride in its thriving agricultural sector,\" said Liu Yun, the city's Party chief. The city's vegetable production totaled 13.6 million metric tons last year, leading the nation. It boasts robust industrial chains for livestock and poultry, flowers and agricultural machinery.\n\"We will deepen economic and trade cooperation with CELAC countries to build Weifang into a new hub for agricultural cooperation, a center for trade and investment, and a window for exchanges and mutual learning,\" Liu said.\nAt the forum, China and 26 CELAC countries reached a consensus on agricultural priority areas and set a course for the next five years. Apart from bolstering existing cooperation in animal and crop production techniques, agricultural technology, animal husbandry and veterinary services, the two parties will explore cooperation in artificial intelligence, smart agriculture, rural revitalization and other emerging sectors.\nIn the next five years, China plans to establish at least three demonstration farms in CELAC countries.",
