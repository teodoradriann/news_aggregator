    "text": "Tonix Pharmaceuticals Receives First Contract Payment from U.S. Department of Defense for Accelerated Development of Broad-Spectrum Antivirals with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Tonix Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: TNXP) has received its first payment from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under a contract worth up to $34 million over five years. The funding aims to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents for protecting military personnel in biological threat environments. This non-dilutive funding supports Tonix's ongoing research to advance its antiviral discovery program. The contract will accelerate the development of Tonix's broad-spectrum antiviral program, focusing on phosphatase inhibitors targeting CD45. The company plans to optimize lead compounds for therapeutic intervention against biothreat agents. Tonix will utilize its research facilities, including a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) lab at its research and development center in Frederick, Md., to carry out this work. - Secured a contract worth up to $34 million over five years from the U.S. Department of Defense - Received first payment under the DTRA contract, providing non-dilutive funding - Validation of Tonix's antiviral discovery program by a government agency - Access to state-of-the-art research facilities, including a BSL-3 lab, for project execution - None. Insights The The focus on broad-spectrum antivirals for military personnel has dual-use potential, with applications in both defense and civilian markets. The CD45 inhibitor approach is innovative, aiming to balance antiviral efficacy with safety. If successful, this could lead to a valuable pipeline asset. Tonix's BSL-3 lab and strategic location near the U.S. biodefense research hub are strong assets, potentially facilitating future collaborations and contracts. However, investors should note that drug development is inherently risky and success is not guaranteed despite government backing. This contract signifies the DoD's increasing focus on biodefense, reflecting growing concerns about biological threats in military operations. The The contract's structure, with milestone-based payments, aligns well with the drug development process. It reduces financial risk for Tonix while allowing the DoD to monitor progress closely. The potential for a broad-spectrum antiviral is particularly valuable for military applications, where rapid response to unknown pathogens is critical. If successful, this project could position Tonix as a key player in the biodefense sector, potentially leading to additional government contracts. However, the highly specialized nature of this work may limit immediate commercial applications outside of government use. First payment received under Tonix’s contract with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), for up to CHATHAM, N.J., Oct. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: TNXP) (Tonix or the Company), a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company with marketed products and a pipeline of development candidates, received its first payment from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), to develop small molecule broad-spectrum antiviral agents for the prevention or treatment of infections to improve the medical readiness of military personnel in biological threat environments. The previously announced award from DTRA is for up to “This award provides important validation and substantial non-dilutive funding for our ongoing research to advance our antiviral discovery program,” said Seth Lederman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Tonix Pharmaceuticals “With biological adaptations and mutations happening to viruses rapidly across the globe, this research will be crucial in order to protect lives in the event biological threats are introduced onto the battlefield.” The Tonix will utilize its state-of-the-art research laboratory capabilities, including a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) lab at its research and development center (RDC) facility located in Frederick, Md., as well as experienced personnel in-house. The RDC is located in Maryland’s ‘I-270 biotech corridor’ and is close to the center of the U.S. biodefense research community.

    "text": "„Kölner Treff“ vor ungewisser Zukunft: Mitarbeiter suchen plötzlich neue Jobs – das steckt dahinter\nUnruhige Zeiten für den „Kölner Treff“: Wichtige Mitarbeiter orientieren sich neu und werden auf dem Jobmarkt aktiv. Was steckt dahinter?\nKöln – Bettina Böttinger (69) moderierte 17 Jahre lang den „Kölner Treff“ im WDR (2006 bis 2023). Die Talkshow ist zugleich das wichtigste Projekt der Produktionsfirma Encanto Film- und Fernsehproduktions GmbH, die die 69-Jährige in den 90er-Jahren gegründet hatte und von der sie seither Geschäftsführerin ist.\nJetzt ist Schluss: Zum Ende des Jahres schließt die Firma. Über die genauen Hintergründe, über die in einigen Medien spekuliert wird, wollte sich Böttinger auf Anfrage von dwdl.de nicht äußern. „Ich möchte zur Zeit nicht kommentieren“, schrieb sie am Montagabend.\nMit dem „Kölner Treff“, der seit 2023 von Susan Link und Micky Beisenherz moderiert wird, soll es dennoch weitergehen, teilte der WDR auf Anfrage von dwdl.de mit. „Da Bettina Böttinger ihre Produktionsfirma Encanto, die gemeinsam mit dem WDR den ‚Kölner Treff‘ produziert, nicht mehr weiterführen wird, werden wir die Produktion ab 2026 neu regeln. Mit welcher Produktionsfirma wir den ‚Kölner Treff‘ in Zukunft produzieren, teilen wir zum gegebenen Zeitpunkt mit“, erklärte eine Sprecherin des Senders.\nZukunft der Belegschaft ist offen: Mitarbeiter suchen bereits neue Jobs\nDie Zukunft der beliebten Sendung scheint gesichert, doch wie es für die Belegschaft von Encanto weitergeht, ist noch offen. Mehrere Mitarbeitende, die bislang in führenden Positionen bei der Produktionsfirma tätig waren, fügten ihren öffentlichen Profilen auf der Plattform LinkedIn den Vermerk „open to work“ hinzu, unter anderem die Redaktionsleiterin des „Kölner Treffs“ und der Chef vom Dienst.\nNeben dem „Kölner Treff“ sind weitere Projekte von dem Aus der Firma betroffen. Für den SWR produzierte Encanto seit 2015 „Krause kommt“. Im Mai 2025 startete außerdem der von Böttinger selbst moderierte Podcast „Zwischen den Zeilen“, der von Encanto und Early Studios produziert wurde.

    "text": "THE GAME: Bobby Miller left the game in the third inning after being hit in the head by a line drive and the Dodgers went on to lose to the Chicago Cubs, 12-4, on Thursday afternoon in the Cactus League opener for the two teams that are scheduled to open the regular season in Tokyo next month.\nPITCHING REPORT: Miller was facing his second batter in the third inning, Michael Busch, when Busch hit a line drive back at him. The ball left Busch’s bat at 106 mph and hit Miller in the side of the head. Miller dropped to the ground clutching his head but was able to stand up and leave the game under his own power. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said it was “a very scary moment.” Miller will be in concussion protocol indefinitely. “We’ll keep an eye on him tonight,” Roberts said. “We have to make sure that he feels okay going forward. I don’t know how long this protocol lasts. … But it was good to see him actually walk off the field and know where he was at.”… Yoshinobu Yamamoto faced the first eight hitters of the game, retiring five (two on strikeouts) and allowing three singles. Yamamoto threw 27 pitches and hit 96 mph with his fastball.\nHITTING REPORT: Eddie Rosario hit the Dodgers’ first home run of the spring. The non-roster outfielder who won the 2021 NLCS MVP for the Braves against the Dodgers hit a two-run home run in the second inning. … Another non-roster player, David Bote was 2 for 2 with a pair of singles. … Catcher Hunter Feduccia was 1 for 2 with a double. Chris Okey drove in a run with a bloop double.\nDEFENSE REPORT: Highly-regarded prospect Zyhir Hope made two outstanding catches in left field. In the fifth inning, he came in to make a diving catch of a sinking line drive. In the sixth inning, he ran into the outfield wall while catching Pablo Aliendo’s drive.\nABS REPORT: MLB is testing the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) system during spring training including all of the Dodgers’ games at Camelback Ranch. Each team will be allowed two challenges per game, the same system used in Triple-A the past two seasons. Cubs starter Cody Poteet put the system to use in the first inning when an 0-and-1 fastball at the knees to Muncy was called a ball. The call was changed to a strike after the challenge. “I don’t hate the idea of it,” said Muncy, who became familiar with the ABS system during a minor-league rehab assignment last year. “The technology, I think they’ll admit, is not entirely there yet but it’s a cool idea and I like it.”\nBefore the game, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts joked that Muncy was the only player forbidden to challenge calls because “he’s our biggest culprit of not agreeing with the strike zone.” Muncy got some grief from his teammates about that.\n“Freddie called me out in the meeting and said, ‘You’re banned from using challenges,’” Muncy said. “I don’t know why. I guess that’s just because everyone just knows I have a good idea of the strike zone. But of course it’s me that gets the first one after all those guys are joking about it. So fitting. When I came back, Freddie was waiting for me just laughing right in my face. Go figure.”\nUP NEXT: Dodgers (RHP Tony Gonsolin) vs. Cubs (LHP Jordan Wicks) at Sloan Park in Mesa, Friday, 12:05 p.m. PT, SportsNet LA, 570 AM",

    "text": "[Raphael](https://www.ecuavisa.com/metadatos/-/meta/raphael), el icónico cantante de 81 años, ha tenido que cancelar los dos conciertos que tenía previstos para este fin de semana en el WiZink Center de Madrid, tras sufrir un accidente cerebrovascular el pasado martes mientras grababa el especial navideño de La Revuelta.\nAfortunadamente, el parte médico emitido este miércoles ha descartado que el artista haya sufrido un ictus, lo que ha tranquilizado tanto a sus familiares como a sus seguidores.

El cantante renace en Buenos Aires con radical actitud](https://www.ecuavisa.com/entretenimiento/musica/luis-miguel-buenos-aires-cambia-radicalmente-actitud-DY8504317)\nEl cantante, que continúa ingresado en el Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre de Madrid, se someterá a más pruebas para determinar el origen del proceso neurológico que ha experimentado. Los médicos, que han trasladado al artista desde el Hospital Clínico San Carlos, indicaron que aún es necesario seguir investigando la causa de los síntomas que presentó.\nEn declaraciones a la prensa, la esposa de Raphael, Natalia Figueroa, mostró su optimismo al comentar el estado de salud de su marido: “Todo va muy bien, muy, muy bien”, afirmó brevemente a la salida del hospital.\nFigueroa también se refirió a la cancelación de los conciertos, expresando que la decisión fue tomada con resignación por parte del cantante, quien lamentó profundamente no poder cumplir con su compromiso ante el público.\nLea también: [Los hijos de John Lennon se reúnen en el icónico edificio Dakota para una noche especial](https://www.ecuavisa.com/entretenimiento/musica/hijos-john-lennon-reunen-iconico-edificio-dakota-JM8493380)\nJacobo Martos, hijo de Raphael, ofreció más detalles sobre el estado de su padre, confirmando que el cantante sigue en observación para completar un par de pruebas adicionales. “Está muy bien, con ánimo y deseando salir.

    "text": "The President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, announced this evening that when someone thinks to say that it is normal for the Serbian language to be official in Montenegro, it causes riots, riots, and chaos. \"When, even after the census, it becomes completely clear that in Montenegro the Serbian language is the language of the majority of people who live there, when someone thinks to say, well, I guess it's normal that the majority language in a country, if nothing else, is official, these others can also they are spoken by a much smaller number of people, but I guess that is logical, at that second you are causing riots, riots, chaos, demolishing I don't know what. And what is more natural than that, and what is more normal than that. Well, nothing, but who cares. This must not be allowed for the Serbs. For all others it is allowed, for Serbs it is not allowed. Serbs must not be allowed to live on their own in Kosovo and Metohiji,\" he said Vučić at a meeting in Vršac on the occasion 16 years since the founding of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). As reported by Radio Television of Serbia (RTS), Vučić said that then Serbia began to wake up and that there was great hope and a great desire of the people for change. \"16 years ago, when President (Tomislav) Nikolić started founding the party, there was a great hope, there was a huge desire of the people for changes, because those who led Serbia destroyed it in a national, political, and economic sense. And Serbia started to wake up,\" said Vučić. As he said, those who were in power at the time did not understand that you cannot leave 550.000 people without work without people seeing it and feeling it. \"They thought it was possible to keep quiet and pretend to be silly about the fact that they told the people that Kosovo was a democratic issue and that they would easily solve it with their Western friends, so they told us standards before status. When it came to self-proclaiming independence of Kosovo, then they hid, shied away from responsibility and passed it on to each other, without taking any action,\" said Vučić. He added that the government at that time forgot that because of their irresponsibility, Montenegro first left the joint state, then the state union. \"In that picture of complete national, general political and overall economic collapse, a political party appeared that was supposed to unite people of different beliefs with the hope that they could change something in Serbia,\" he said.
