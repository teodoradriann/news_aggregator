    "text": "Simply Wall St. UOA Development Bhd (KLSE:UOADEV) shareholders have earned a 5.0% CAGR over the last five years Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) 29 December 2023 at 1:00 am · 3-min read\nIt's possible to achieve returns close to the market-weighted average return by buying an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more -- or less -- than that. While the UOA Development Bhd (KLSE:UOADEV) share price is down 18% over half a decade, the total return to shareholders (which includes dividends) was 28%. And that total return actually beats the market decline of 16%.\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\nSee our latest analysis for UOA Development Bhd\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nLooking back five years, both UOA Development Bhd's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 19% per year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 4% compound annual share price fall. The relatively muted share price reaction might be because the market expects the business to turn around.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nKLSE:UOADEV Earnings Per Share Growth December 28th 2023 Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, UOA Development Bhd's TSR for the last 5 years was 28%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nStory continues A Different Perspective It's good to see that UOA Development Bhd has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 28% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 5% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for UOA Development Bhd (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

    "text": "光热转换是一种将光能转化为热能的过程，在环境治理、能源开发和医学应用等领域具有重要价值。这一过程高度依赖于具备强光吸收能力和高效光热转换性能的材料。金纳米粒子（AuNCs）凭借其卓越的表面等离子共振（LSPR）特性、宽光谱吸收能力、快速光响应以及高效热产生能力，在太阳能收集、癌症治疗和光催化等领域展现出巨大的应用潜力。然而，由于高表面能引发的团聚效应，AuNCs的性能往往迅速下降，如何精准合成AuNCs并提升其稳定性和光热性能仍是一项重大挑战。\n图1. 使用各种方法稳定的AuNCs和超蕃分子笼稳定的AuNCs（本工作）\n近日，湖南大学何清教授（点击查看介绍）团队在铁蛋白分子的启发下，开发了一种具有准封闭内腔的超蕃分子笼TBN-Superphane（图1e），可有效防止AuNCs的聚集。超蕃与Au3+结合并原位还原后，得到的AuNCs（Au18）具有均一的尺寸分布和优异的稳定性。固态AuNCs@TBN-Superphane表现出快速的光响应、高光热转化能力和稳定性，808 nm下的光热转换效率可达92.8%。一个标准太阳光下的水蒸发速率达2.35 kg m-2 h-1，太阳能蒸汽效率为95.1%，同时具有优异的耐盐性，在实际海水蒸发中性能依旧得到保持。这是首个利用分子笼稳定金纳米团簇（AuNCs）并应用于光热转化的实例，其光热转换效率和太阳能蒸汽生成速率接近文献报道的最高水平。该结构不仅为精确调控超稳定AuNCs的制备提供了高效策略，并展示了其在光热转化领域的优越性能，更突出了其在能源与环境应用中的潜力。这一突破为开发下一代清洁水生产和可再生能源收集材料奠定了基础。\n图2. 超蕃TBN-Superphane的合成路线 (S)-TBN-Superphane的晶体结构\n作者基于联萘单元，制备出具有噻吩基团的醛类前体，通过动态共价键合成了超蕃分子笼 (R)/(S)–TBN–Superphane（图2），有机溶液中的不对称因子可达4.6 × 10⁻³。晶体结构显示 (R)/(S)–TBN–Superphane具有近乎完美的镜像对称结构和近乎封闭的空腔，内部具有多达36个金属配位位点，能对Au3+进行有效结合。还原后得到具有较窄尺寸分布的AuNCs@TBN–Superphane（4.03 ± 0.20 nm），符合晶体结构中二聚体尺寸，室温下能稳定5个月以上不聚集。XPS证明Au3+被有效且完全还原，EDS、FTIR、1H NMR等均表明TBN–Superphane对AuNCs完全包裹。ESI–MS中[M + 6 H2O + 3 MeOH + Au18 + 7 H+]7+的出峰表明AuNCs@TBN–Superphane中超蕃笼以亚胺形式存在，笼内18个金原子聚集形成Au18簇。优化后的结构显示，18个金原子的聚集体完全与TBN–Superphane的中心空腔相匹配，直径约为19.96 Å，与高分辨TEM观察结果完全一致。这些发现证实了金纳米团簇在TBN–Superphane框架内的成功封装，产生了分子精确且几乎孤立的纳米结构——类似于由铁蛋白封装的铁团簇。\n图3. AuNCs@TBN-Superphane的制备、相关表征和理论模拟\n图4. AuNCs@TBN-Superphane光热性能测试\nAuNCs@TBN–Superphane的固体紫外光谱表明其具有优异的光吸收能力（图3）。激光（808 nm，0.5 W/cm2）照射下展现出快速的光响应和热转化能力，3 s内即可升温至120 ˚C，15 s内稳定在150 ˚C，激光关闭后20 s内迅速降至室温。表面温度和激光功率呈正相关，20次循环照射光热性能不发生下降，光热转换效率为92.8%，其效率和耐久性超过了大多数光热材料。进一步将AuNCs@TBN–Superphane用于太阳能制汽和海水净化。在一个标准太阳光照射下具有2.35 kg m-2 h-1的水蒸发速率和95.1%的太阳能蒸汽速率，具有优异的稳定性和耐盐性，即使在海水中20次蒸发循环性能也不发生下降。作者使用简易装置测试了其在真实环境中的海水净化能力。AuNCs@TBN–Superphane展示出16.82 kg•m-2（太阳光照8 h）的总淡水产量，收集得的淡水符合WTO饮用水标准。\n图5. 自然环境下AuNCs@TBN–Superphane海水净化性能测试\n总之，本文通过动态亚胺共价策略，开发了一种具有近乎封闭空腔的超蕃分子笼TBN-Superphane，能够稳定金纳米簇（AuNCs），具有优异的尺寸控制和稳定性，有效防止了金纳米团簇的聚集，确保了尺寸的均匀性和长期稳定性。具有快速光响应和光热转换能力，激光照射下的光热转换性能可达92.8%（808 nm，0.5 W/cm2），一个标准太阳光下的水蒸发速率为2.35 kg m-2 h-1，太阳能蒸汽效率达95.1%，海水中循环蒸发20次性能不发生下降。这些发现为金纳米簇的封装和开发其在能源转换和海水净化中的能力提供了一种可持续的解决方案，以应对清洁能源和淡水生成方面的全球挑战。\n原文（扫描或长按二维码，识别后直达原文页面，或点此查看原文）：\nFerritin–Inspired Encapsulation and Stabilization of Gold Nanoclusters for High–Performance Photothermal Conversion\nYi Zhang, Juan Zhou, Ke Luo, Wei Zhou, Fei Wang*, Jialian Li*, and Qing He*\nAngew.

    "title": "Leah Remini and Husband Angelo Pagan Announce Divorce After 21 Years Together",
    "text": "Leah Remini , 54, and her entrepreneur husband, Angelo Pagán, have decided to part ways after more than two decades of marriage. The couple made their separation public through a joint statement on social media platforms on Thursday, Aug. 29.\nThe announcement, shared on Instagram , began with an acknowledgment of their long-standing union: \"Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce.\" The couple noted that the decision was not made lightly, stating, \"This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it's what's best for us.\"\nRemini and Pagán's love story began in 1996 when they first crossed paths at El Floridita, a Cuban establishment in Los Angeles where Pagán was performing. Their connection was instantaneous, with Remini later recalling in a 2010 Redbook interview, \"For me, it was love at first sight.\" This chance meeting led to their marriage in 2003 and the birth of their daughter, Sofia Bella, on June 16, 2004.\nThroughout their relationship, the couple has been open about the challenges they've faced. During a 2019 appearance on the talk show RuPaul via People , Remini shared, \"It's a beautiful love story because we did have a hard time at the beginning. We didn't meet under the best of circumstances. We got counseling and it was not an easy road.\" She also humorously recounted their first meeting: \"I saw him across the room and was like, 'Damn! What time do you get off?' It was like everything wrong, like everything that you should not do as a girl is ask a guy when he gets off work, hit it real quick, and it was a lot of that ... I was like a groupie.\"\nIn their divorce announcement, the couple addressed the reasons behind their decision, stating, \"To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn't fit us anymore. After a lot of effort and consideration, we've decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today.\"\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini)\nDespite the end of their marriage, Remini and Pagán maintained their ongoing commitment to their family and each other: \"We will still continue celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family.\"\nThe couple's statement also reflected on the success of their marriage, viewing it through a lens of gratitude and accomplishment: \"We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate. From our perspective, this marriage was a huge success.\" They added, \"Our bond is still strong—it's just evolved into something different.\"\nRemini and Pagán's decision to share their divorce publicly stems from their history of honesty about their relationship. The couple has been featured in various television productions, including a TLC reality show and VH1 specials, which gave fans an intimate look into their married life. In their statement, they expressed a desire to continue this transparency: \"We are sharing this unknown territory with you all as we take our first steps into this next stage of our lives publicly.\"\nThe couple also hopes that their experience can provide comfort and inspiration to others facing similar life changes. They stated, \"We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year. We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships—whether they change or end—aren't failures.\"\nRelated:\nLeah Remini Reacts to 25th Anniversary of 'King of Queens' Leah Remini Speaks out After Danny Masterson Sentencing Julie Chen Moonves Reveals How She and Leah Remini Made up After 8 Years of Fighting Throughout their time together, Remini and Pagán have not only been life partners but also professional collaborators. Pagán made several guest appearances on Remini's hit sitcom, The King of Queens , further tying their personal and professional lives together.\nAs she embarks on this new chapter, Remini is looking toward the future with optimism. Remini recently celebrated a personal achievement , earning an associate's degree from New York University (NYU) in March 2024. She shared this accomplishment on social media, describing it as a \"terrifying journey\" that began \"at the age of 50 after only having an 8th-grade education.\" She added, \"After three years of hard work, long nights, tears, and wanting to give up so many times, I have earned an associate's degree from NYU. I'm now working on my bachelor's degree.\"",

    "title": "We’ll make poor ‘lakhpatis’: Rahul Gandhi",
    "text": "HYDERABAD: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre worked for only 25 people in the country like Adanis-Ambanis and made them 'billionaires' in the last ten years but the Congress-led IN.D.I.A. bloc will make millions of poor people 'lakhpatis' in the next five years, if voted to power in the Lok Sabha elections.Alleging that Prime Minister Modi had privatised several government firms in order to abolish reservations, he said, \\\"These elections are very critical. Firstly, the BJP and RSS are openly saying that they want to change the Constitution and abolish reservations. But Congress wants to increase reservations beyond 50 per cent. If voted to power, we will take up caste census across the country like the Congress government’s caste survey in Telangana state.\\\"He was addressing election meetings in Narsapur in Medak candidate Neelam Madhu Mudiran and Saroornagar for Hyderabad nominee Sameer Waliullah along with Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy on Friday. He expressed confidence that the Congress-led I.N.D.I.A bloc will come to power on June 4 and begin the process to fill 30 lakh government jobs from August 15.Rahul Gandhi said that the I.N.D.I.A. government, if voted to power, will take up a revolutionary programme that people would not even have dreamt of. It will be the world’s first-of-its-kind programme, he said.\\\"A list of all the poor and downtrodden would be prepared by visiting the remotest places in the country. One woman from a family would be identified and in her bank account we will deposit `1 lakh annually. She will get `8,500 per month and towards meeting her children’s education, health and food expenditure, an additional `8,500 would be deposited in the women’s bank account on the first of every month.”Going further, he said “With one stroke, we will eradicate poverty in the country. People will spend this amount to meet their daily needs. This would in turn pave the way for industrialisation as local companies will come up to produce goods and thereby generate jobs. In a way, the Indian economic system would be jump-started,\\\" he said.He cautioned the people that if the Constitution was amended by the BJP, it would weaken their rights.\\\"This Constitution gave you voting, reservation and education rights apart from the right to speak and protest. That is real democracy. They want to weaken this democracy because they only want power. They only want their businessmen friends to thrive. They have sold the country’s assets to these ‘friends’,\\\" said the Congress leader.Rahul Gandhi promised to implement a new scheme \\\"First job pakki\\\" for the unemployed youth.\\\"Under this, the Congress will give youth the right to the first job. If you are a diploma holder or graduate, the Congress party will give you a right to the first job in companies, public sector, private sector, government hospitals and offices. They will be given a year’s job and will be provided exclusive training and deposit `one lakh in their bank account in one year,\\\" he said.Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi praised the performance of the five-month old Congress government in Telangana.\\\"It is working like a team. It has already filled 30,000 jobs and is providing gas cylinders at Rs 500 each and 200 units free power supply; there is health insurance cover of Rs 10 lakh, while women can travel free of cost in RTC buses. Similar to what the Congress government in Telangana has been doing, the I.N.D.I.A. bloc will do it in the entire country, if voted to power,\\\" he said.",
