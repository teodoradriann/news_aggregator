    "text": "2024-02-15 16:31:49 Santander Bank saved more than 71 tons of paper last year (which is the equivalent of almost a thousand trees) by eliminating information brochures made with this material in all its offices. In this way, the entity chaired by Ana Botín progresses in its goal of reducing its environmental footprint, minimizing and managing its waste responsibly, and increasing awareness of environmental problems. The employees of the offices of http://www.elmundo.es/e/ba/banco-santander.html They can share all updated information in digital format with clients who need it. Likewise, the entity is digitalizing many operational processes in the branches, which will result in reducing waste, streamlining the contracting and management of products, and improving customer service times and service. Besides, https://es-es.facebook.com/bancosantander is reducing paper consumption in the correspondence sent to its clients, providing them with the possibility of receiving their communications digitally through the web application or mobile phone. Currently, eight million Banco Santander customers in Spain have chosen to receive their correspondence and notices digitally. In this way, the entity chaired by Ana Botín issued 6% fewer letters in Spain in 2023 compared to 2022, which is equivalent to two million envelopes. Banco Santander has been carbon neutral in Spain since 2020 in its activity, and continues to reduce its environmental impacts and increase compensation for those emissions that it cannot reduce. In this sense, 100% of the electrical energy it uses comes from renewable sources, it has eliminated single-use plastics, it has obtained the ‘Zero Waste’ certification from AENOR, and last year it reduced its electricity consumption by 493 tons. paper, which represents a cut of 27.5% compared to the 2022 figure and more than 76% compared to 2011, when Banco Santander began the implementation of plans and initiatives to measure and reduce its environmental footprint. In the words of Marta Aisa, director of Responsible Banking and Sustainability at Santander Spain, «We work every year to reduce the environmental footprint we generate; Reducing paper consumption in our offices is part of our commitment to continue providing the best service to our clients while responsibly managing our environmental footprint. This initiative adds to the set of measures that we have been adopting to ensure that our work environments are respectful of the environment, such as the use of renewable energy, the commitment to zero waste and recovery. #Banco #Santander #saves #tons #paper #eliminating #information #brochures #offices",

    "title": "Vatican States That the Church Can Bless Same-Sex Couples Without Affecting the Understanding of Marriage",
    "text": "The Vatican has issued a\ndeclaration that permits churches to bless same-sex couples and those in “irregular situations” without “producing confusion with the blessing proper to the Sacrament of Marriage.” According to the declaration, non-liturgical blessings can be given to same-sex couples and couples civilly remarried without an annulment. “In such cases, a blessing may be imparted that not only has an ascending value but also involves the invocation of a blessing that descends from God upon those who—recognizing themselves to be destitute and in need of his help—do not claim a legitimation of their own status, but who beg that all that is true, good, and humanly valid in their lives and their relationships be enriched, healed, and elevated by the presence of the Holy Spirit.” The declaration stated that requests for such non-liturgical blessings were a sign of a person’s seeking God and should not be turned away. “God never turns away anyone who approaches him! Ultimately, a blessing offers people a means to increase their trust in God. The request for a blessing, thus, expresses and nurtures openness to the transcendence, mercy, and closeness to God in a thousand concrete circumstances of life, which is no small thing in the world in which we live.”\nThe declaration stated that it was important that such blessings were differentiated from marital blessings, which the Catholic church still affirms as being between a man and a woman. “Indeed, through these blessings that are given not through the ritual forms proper to the liturgy but as an expression of the Church’s maternal heart—similar to those that emanate from the core of popular piety—there is no intention to legitimize anything, but rather to open one’s life to God, to ask for his help to live better, and also to invoke the Holy Spirit so that the values of the Gospel may be lived with greater faithfulness.” The declaration further stated that its response should be sufficient for further questions. “What has been said in this Declaration regarding the blessings of same-sex couples is sufficient to guide the prudent and fatherly discernment of ordained ministers in this regard. Thus, beyond the guidance provided above, no further responses should be expected about possible ways to regulate details or practicalities regarding blessings of this type.”\nBishops were split over the declaration. Bishops in more liberal-leaning countries like France, Germany, and the United States appear to have embraced the declaration, seeing it as a step in the right direction towards limiting stigma against same-sex attracted individuals in the Catholic Church.\nGerman priest Rev. Wolfgang Rothe praised the declaration. “In my church, such blessings always take place when anyone has the need,” he said. He noted that, “in many countries around the world there are opposing moves to maintain homophobia in the church. For homosexual couples living there, the document will be a huge relief.”\nHowever, Archbishop Tomash Peta of Saint Mary in Astana, Kazakhstan,\nopenly rebuked the statement. “The manifest purpose of the Declaration of the Holy See, Fiducia supplicans, is to allow ‘the possibility of blessing couples in irregular situations and same-sex couples.’ At the same time, the document insists that such blessings are performed ‘without officially validating their status or changing in any way the Church’s perennial teaching on marriage,’” Peta began. He warned pastors against the “great deception” of the declaration, writing that the declaration had made the Catholic Church “a propagandist of the globalist and ungodly ‘gender ideology.’” His rebuke also prohibited any priests in his diocese from doing such blessings. He affirmed that such blessings are only for those who are no longer practicing sinful practices such as cohabitation and homosexuality. He called on Pope Francis to revoke the permission, “so that the Catholic Church may shine clearly as the ‘pillar and ground of the truth’ (1 Tim 3:15) for all those who sincerely seek to know the will of God and, by fulfilling it, to attain eternal life.”",

    "text": "Trabalhadores da Boeing iniciam greve nos EUA após rejeitarem proposta da empresa 13/09/2024 08h59\nMilhares de trabalhadores da Boeing iniciaram, nesta sexta-feira (13), uma greve na região de Seattle, no noroeste dos Estados Unidos, depois de votarem esmagadoramente contra o novo acordo proposto pela gigante da aviação.\nEsta é a primeira greve em 16 anos na empresa americana, que afirmou estar \"comprometida\" com as negociações em meio à sua difícil situação financeira.\nO acordo proposto pela Boeing foi rejeitado com 94,6% dos votos e a greve aprovada com 96%, disse Jon Holden, presidente do sindicato 'International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751'.\n\"Nossos membros falaram claramente esta noite\", disse o líder deste sindicato que representa mais de 30 mil trabalhadores da fabricante aeronáutica nesta região.\nA greve começou à meia-noite desta sexta-feira (04h00 no horário de Brasília).\n- \"Seguimos comprometidos\" - O protesto afeta duas grandes montadoras no estreito de Puget Sound e paralisa a produção dos aviões 737, 777 e 767, cujas entregas já estão atrasadas.\nIsto representa um problema adicional à fabricante que recebe a maior parte do pagamento (cerca de 60%) quando a aeronave é entregue.\nApesar da votação esmagadora a favor da greve, o grupo Boeing afirmou em um comunicado que está \"comprometido\" com as negociações.\n\"Continuamos empenhados em restabelecer nossa relação com nossos colaboradores e com o sindicato e estamos prontos para voltar à mesa de negociações para chegar a um novo acordo\", afirmou a empresa.\nSegundo analistas da TD Cowen, uma greve de 50 dias privaria a Boeing de entre 3 bilhões e 3,5 bilhões de dólares (16,9 a 19,79 bilhões de reais) em liquidez e teria um impacto de 5,5 bilhões de dólares (31,10 bilhões de reais) nas receitas.\nA proposta inicial previa um aumento salarial de 25% ao longo de quatro anos e a promessa de investimentos nesta região.\nPrevia também a construção da próxima aeronave, anunciada para 2035, na região de Seattle, berço histórico da fabricante, que deverá garantir empregos para as próximas décadas.\n- Um aumento \"ilusório\" - Porém, os trabalhadores consideraram que o acordo não era tão generoso e apontaram, por exemplo, que o aumento de 25% era ilusório porque, ao mesmo tempo, cortava um bônus anual.\n\"Estão falando de um aumento de 25% e esse não é o caso\", disse Paul Janousek, eletricista da fábrica em Everett que votou pela greve.\nJanousek, de 55 anos e há 13 anos na Boeing, estima que o aumento seria de 9% com a eliminação do bônus anual.\nA greve ocorre em um contexto delicado para a Boeing, cuja reputação foi manchada por vários incidentes de segurança aérea.\nA fabricante enfrenta uma situação econômica complicada após os acidentes de dois 737 MAX 8 em 2018 e 2019, que tiraram a vida a 346 pessoas, além de vários outros problemas.\n\"Não é segredo que nosso negócio está passando por um momento difícil, em parte devido aos nossos próprios erros do passado. (...) Uma greve colocaria em risco a nossa recuperação\", alertou Kelly Ortberg, CEO da empresa desde agosto.\njmb/sw/dbh/jm/es/jc/fp/aa\n© Agence France-Presse",

    "text": "3 horas La policía india está tratando de reconstruir la historia de una mujer rusa que fue encontrada viviendo en una cueva en el estado de Karnataka con sus dos hijas pequeñas.\nNina Kutina fue rescatada el 9 de julio por agentes que realizaban una patrulla rutinaria cerca de las colinas de Ramteertha, en el bosque de Gokarna, que limita con el paraíso turístico de Goa.\nLas autoridades afirman que la mujer, de 40 años, y sus hijas, de seis y cinco años, no tienen documentos válidos para permanecer en India. Las tres han sido alojadas en un centro de detención para extranjeros cerca de Bangalore, la capital del estado, y serán deportadas pronto.\nKutina ha defendido su estilo de vida en dos entrevistas en video concedidas a la agencia de noticias india ANI, en las que afirma que ella y sus hijas eran felices viviendo en la cueva y que \"la naturaleza da buena salud\".\nPero, incluso una semana después de su hallazgo, sigue sin estar claro cómo llegaron la mujer y sus hijas a un bosque lleno de serpientes y animales salvajes, cuánto tiempo llevaban viviendo allí y quiénes son realmente.\nCómo las encontro la policía \"La zona es muy popular entre los turistas, especialmente los extranjeros. Pero hay muchas serpientes y es propensa a los deslizamientos de tierra, sobre todo durante la temporada de lluvias. Para garantizar la seguridad de los turistas, el año pasado comenzamos a patrullar los bosques\", le explicó a la BBC M. Narayana, superintendente de policía del distrito de Uttara Kannada.\nUn segundo policía, cuyo nombre no puede revelarse y que formaba parte de la patrulla que se topó con la cueva, dijo que bajaron por una colina empinada para investigar cuando vieron ropa de colores vivos que había sido tendida al aire libre.\nCuando se acercaron a la caverna, cuya entrada había sido tapada con saris, \"una niña rubia salió corriendo\". Cuando los policías, sorprendidos, la siguieron al interior de la cueva, encontraron a Nina Kutina y a la otra niña.\nSus pertenencias eran escasas: esterillas de plástico, ropa, paquetes de fideos instantáneos y algunos otros alimentos. La cueva tenía goteras.\nLos videos grabados por la policía en la gruta, a los que ha tenido acceso la BBC, muestran a los niños vestidos con coloridos trajes indios, sonriendo a la cámara.\n\"La mujer y sus hijas parecían bastante cómodas en ese lugar\", dijo Narayana. \"Nos llevó un tiempo convencerla de que era peligroso vivir allí\", añadió.\nLa policía dijo que, cuando le dijeron que la cueva era insegura debido a la presencia de serpientes y animales salvajes en el bosque, ella les respondió: \"Las serpientes y otros animales son nuestros amigos. Los humanos son peligrosos\".\nKutina y sus hijas fueron trasladadas a un hospital para ser examinadas tras su rescate y se determinó que se encontraban en buen estado de salud.\n¿Quién es Nina Kutina? Fuente de la imagen, ANI\nPie de foto, Nina Kutina ha dicho que nació en Rusia, pero no vive allí desde hace 15 años. Un funcionario de la Oficina Regional de Registro de Extranjeros (FRRO, por sus siglas en inglés) le confirmó a la BBC que Kutina es rusa y que será repatriada una vez se completen los trámites.\nSegún el funcionario, ya se pusieron en contacto con el consulado ruso en Chennai. La BBC contactó a la embajada rusa en Nueva Delhi, pero aún no ha recibido respuesta.\nEn entrevistas en video con las agencias de noticias indias ANI y PTI, Kutina dijo que nació en Rusia pero no vive allí desde hace 15 años y que ha viajado a \"muchos países: Costa Rica, Malasia, Bali, Tailandia, Nepal, Ucrania\".\nEn sus entrevistas con ambas agencias, Kutina dijo que tiene cuatro hijos de entre 20 y 5 años. De su hijo mayor, dijo que murió en un accidente de tráfico en Goa el año pasado.\nLas autoridades señalan que su ahora segundo hijo tiene 11 años y se encuentra en Rusia.\nEl martes por la noche, la FRRO afirmó que había localizado al padre de las niñas, Dror Goldstein, y que se trataba de un empresario israelí.\nFuncionarios de la entidad dijeron que Goldstein se encontraba en India en ese momento y que se habían reunido con él para intentar convencerlo de que pagara la repatriación de Kutina y sus hijas.\nEl miércoles, Goldstein le dijo al canal indio NDTV que Kutina había abandonado Goa sin informarle y que él había presentado una denuncia por desaparición ante la policía local.\nAfirmó que quiere la custodia compartida de sus hijas y que haría todo lo posible para impedir que el gobierno indio las envíe a Rusia.\n¿Cuándo llegó al bosque de Gokarna? No está claro cómo y cuándo Kutina y sus hijas llegaron al bosque de Gokarna, en el estado de Karnataka.\nLa policía dijo que ella les contó que llevaban una semana viviendo en la cueva, y que había comprado algunas verduras y otros alimentos, incluida una marca popular de fideos instantáneos, en una tienda local hacía una semana.\nSegún los policías, Kutina les dijo que había llegado a Karnataka desde Goa, donde también había vivido en una cueva. Y agregó que allí había nacido una de sus hijas.\nEn su entrevista con PTI este miércoles, la mujer se quejó del centro de detención en el que se encuentra alojada con sus hijas, diciendo que \"es como una cárcel\".\n\"Vivíamos en un lugar muy bueno. Pero ahora no podemos estar solas. No podemos salir. Aquí está muy sucio y no hay suficiente comida\", añadió.\nNo está claro cuándo ni cómo llegó Kutina a India.\nLa policía señaló que ella les dijo que había perdido su pasaporte, pero encontraron entre sus pertenencias un pasaporte caducado que indicaba que había llegado a India con un visado de negocios válido desde el 18 de octubre de 2016 hasta el 17 de abril de 2017.\nPero ella se quedó más tiempo del permitido, fue detenida un año después y la oficina de la FRRO en Goa le expidió un \"permiso de salida\" para abandonar el país. Según los sellos de inmigración de su pasaporte, entró a Nepal el 19 de abril de 2018 y salió tres meses después.\nNo está claro adónde fue después, pero Kutina dijo a la agencia ANI que había \"viajado al menos a 20 países\", como mínimo a \"cuatro de ellos desde que salió de India en 2018\".\nTampoco está claro cuándo regresó a India, aunque algunos informes indican que lo hizo en febrero de 2020.\nElla le dijo a PTI, otra agencia de noticias, que regresó por amor al país.\nKutina admitió que su visado había caducado hacía unos meses. \"No tenemos visado válido, el nuestro caducó\", dijo, y añadió que se le pasó el lapso que tenía porque estaba en duelo por su hijo fallecido y no podía pensar en nada más.\n¿Por qué vivía en una cueva? Fuente de la imagen, Policía de Karnataka\nPie de foto, La entrada a la cueva donde Kutina vivía con sus hijas había sido cubierta con saris de colores vivos. Después de que se encontrara una imagen de Panduranga Vittala, una forma del dios hindú Krishna, en la cueva donde vivía, se dijo que ella había ido allí para meditar y por motivos espirituales.\nPero en su entrevista con ANI, ella desmintió esa versión. \"No se trata de nada espiritual. Simplemente nos gusta la naturaleza porque nos da salud... Es muy saludable, no es como vivir en una casa\".\nAñadió que tenía \"mucha experiencia vivendo en la naturaleza, en la selva\" e insistió en que sus hijas eran felices y estaban sanas allí. La cueva que había elegido era \"muy grande y bonita\" y estaba \"muy cerca de un pueblo\", por lo que podía comprar comida y otras cosas necesarias.\n\"No nos estábamos muriendo, y no llevé a mis hijas a morir a la selva. Eran muy felices, nadaban en la cascada, tenían un lugar muy bueno para dormir, muchas clases de arte, hacíamos cosas con arcilla, pintábamos, comíamos bien, yo cocinaba muy bien y la comida era sabrosa\", declaró a ANI.\nKutina también rechazó las insinuaciones de que vivir en el bosque exponía a sus hijas al peligro.\n\"Durante todo el tiempo que vivimos allí, sí, vimos algunas serpientes\", dijo, pero añadió que era similar a cuando la gente dice que encuentra serpientes en sus casas, cocinas o baños.\nHaz clic aquí para leer más historias de BBC News Mundo.\nSuscríbete aquí a nuestro nuevo newsletter para recibir cada viernes una selección de nuestro mejor contenido de la semana.\nTambién puedes seguirnos en YouTube , Instagram , TikTok , X , Facebook y en nuestro canal de WhatsApp .\nY recuerda que puedes recibir notificaciones en nuestra app. Descarga la última versión y actívalas.",

    "text": "Paris 2024 : quel succès pour Vélib' ! © Shutterstock, Media365 Selon le rapport du Syndicat Autolib' Vélib' Métropole (SAVM), les vélos en libre-service parisiens ont connu un énorme succès lors des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024. L'organisation olympique et la ville de Paris avaient fait un pari osé. [Encourager les visiteurs et les locaux lors des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques à utiliser le vélo comme mode de déplacement principal](https://auto.orange.fr/mobilite-douce/news/les-jeux-olympiques-de-paris-2024-vont-ils-booster-la-pratique-du-velo-CNT 2ehYVB.html). Avec les restrictions de mobilité en voiture et autres engins motorisés, le deux-roues semblait une solution crédible. Fallait-il encore convaincre. Au début du mois de septembre, le Syndicat Autolib' Vélib' Métropole communiquait les chiffres d'utilisation des Vélib'. On peut dire que les efforts ont payé ! Des stations géantes Si les Vélib' ont été tant plébiscités cet été, c'est sûrement grâce à l'installation des stations géantes. Au total, 10 stations éphémères ont pris place à proximité des sites olympiques. Une façon « d'éviter d'engorger les stations autour et d'assurer à tous les spectateurs des Jeux la possibilité de se stationner à Vélib' » comme l'a précisé le syndicat. Lors des Jeux paralympiques de Paris 2024, 13 000 trajets ont été réalisés au départ ou à destination de ces stations chaque jour. En dehors de ces stations temporaires, celles déjà en place ont également contribué au succès du vélo. 50 000 trajets ont été enregistrés sur la période paralympique. Plus de quatre millions de trajets Pour le syndicat, le succès de ces stations pourrait avoir un impact sur l'avenir. Lors des grands évènements, elles pourraient se pérenniser pour inciter les usagers à se déplacer en vélo. En plus de ces stations, [les places de stationnement ont augmenté](https://auto.orange.fr/mobilite-douce/news/paris-2024-les-gares-parisiennes-font-de-la-place-aux-velos-CNT 2ewcLJ.html) sur la période olympique, tout comme le nombre de vélos : 20 000. L'héritage des Jeux est donc bien réel et c'est la mobilité douce qui en tire le meilleur parti. Si la quinzaine paralympique a enregistré deux millions de trajets, ce sont 4,5 millions de trajets en Vélib' sur la totalité des Jeux de Paris 2024 qui ont été comptabilisés. publié le 4 octobre à 05h00, Thibaut Simon, Media365",

    "title": "The Collection: Christ’s Mercy in Action",
    "text": "by Matthew C. Harrison\nThere’s a theme in the Book of Acts that rarely gets the attention it deserves. In Acts, Luke provides the basic events of the blessed apostles and the church, from Christ’s ascension to Paul’s imprisonment in Rome (A.D. 33–61). St. Paul was brought into the apostolic mission because of this theme (Acts 11:27–30), and later encouraged all his church plants to participate in this task. He spent his entire third missionary journey concerned with this issue (A.D. 54–58), writing and speaking to his mission churches about it, defining it theologically, encouraging churches to get it done, arranging delegates for it and risking his life for it. He gave his life for this mission. What am I talking about? St. Paul’s great collection for the poor suffering saints in the mother church in Jerusalem.\nThe words Paul uses to define the collection of money give us clear indication of how significant this matter was for him. In 2 Corinthians 8–9, the apostle calls the collection a “grace,” a “koinonia” (or participation/fellowship, a word he also uses for the Lord’s Supper! See 1 Cor. 10:15–22), a “diakonia” (service/ministry), a “blessing,” a “good work,” a “eucharistia” or “thanksgiving,” a “liturgy” (public service), a “harvest of righteousness,” and more. These are the most powerful words St. Paul uses in his letters. And he uses them all to describe the local congregations gathering funds to assist suffering Christians.\nFrom the beginning, the church cared for the needs of its people. In this they followed Jesus’ own example. He cared for “body and soul” (Luther). When we think of the money sack that the apostles of Jesus carried, we immediately think of Judas and his theft. The great Lutheran theologian Johann Gerhard, however, noted that the money bag demonstrated the charitable work Jesus and the apostles carried on for the needy, and so Gerhard argued that pastors should also be concerned for the physical well-being of their Christians. In Acts 2:42 we see the earliest apostolic church concerned with the basics, which indeed ought to concern us today.\n“And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship [the collection of money and goods for the needy among them], to the breaking of bread [the Lord’s Supper] and the prayers [worship]” (Acts 2:42). They shared everything. They voluntarily sold property to provide alms for the needy among them. When there was a crisis caused by some ethnic tension, the apostles with the congregation established an order of seven deacons to see that all the widows had enough to eat.\n“Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” … And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem. (Acts 6:3–4, 7)\nAlong the way, Luke tells us that Barnabas (Acts 4:36–37), Cornelius (Acts 10:1–2) and other men of God were particularly generous in giving to the needy. St. Stephen was martyred in A.D. 36, and St. Paul was converted not long after. He’d been persecuting Christians. Barnabas brought this fearsome man and vouched for him before the apostles (Acts 9:27–28). There were waves of persecution and famine in Jerusalem as the Gospel spread. Persecution only caused the church to grow, and soon in Antioch non-Jews were believing in Jesus.\nWhat to do with them? Barnabas was sent down to investigate. He summoned Paul, and they taught these new converts for “a whole year” (ACTS 11:26). Barnabas likely brought Paul in because he knew Judaism and had a record of zealousness for the law. I suspect, knowing how wonderful folks populate the church, that some Gentile convert, aware of the famine which hit Jerusalem, put a bug in Barnabas’ and Paul’s ears that it would be the Christian thing to do to help the mother church. This was a crucial move, as the question of circumcision and following the Mosaic law as new Christians would burn intensely for several years until settled by the Apostolic Council in A.D. 49 (Acts 15). Remember, Paul stood his ground even against Peter on this, and the apostles agreed with Paul. After extending to him the “right hand of fellowship,” “they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing we were eager to do,” said Paul (Gal. 2:9, 10). What an impression the gifts of love of these Gentile converts must have made on the Jerusalem church. Humanly speaking, without them, one wonders if the mother church would have ever been able to get past the issue of requiring non-Jews to take up Jewish laws and customs to become Christians.\nThe famine raged in Jerusalem throughout the 40s and then subsided. Paul and Barnabas quickly moved on. The church in Antioch sent them on the first missionary journey A.D. 47–48 (Acts 13–14). After this they went up to Jerusalem and the circumcision question was solved with the apostles (Acts 15). Paul took off for his second missionary journey (A.D. 49–54). There is not a whisper of the needy Jerusalem church after 49 until the third missionary journey (A.D. 54–58). The conditions in Palestine must have considerably deteriorated again. We know there was a rise of “zealotism” A.D. 55–59, which meant persecution. There was constant political unrest over Roman rule and the establishment that cooperated with Rome. The zealots attacked anyone who cooperated, and attacked intensely any hellenizing influences. The zealots infiltrated the church and pushed against Gentile mission and Paul especially. The zealots were dangerous, and Rome later destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70 because of them. The saints in the mother church were suffering again. Now the “great collection” became Paul’s obsession. Knowledge of the Gospel of free forgiveness by faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus produced love for others — Jesus’ love for others.\nSt. Paul’s most notable churches and compatriots were deeply involved in the collection. Timothy carried 1 Corinthians from Paul in Macedonia to Corinth. He received specific directions for the collection from Paul (1 Cor. 16:10). In fact, he worked with Paul extensively on all matters of the collection while a missionary in Corinth, Macedonia and Ephesus. Titus was involved from day one (2 Cor. 8:6, 16–19), and as a Gentile would have been particularly zealous for the effort. It’s clear that local churches were planning to send their delegates with the money for proper oversight (2 Cor. 8:19–24). That’s who the list of men mentioned in Acts 20:4 were.\nIn 2 Corinthians 8–9, Paul provided specific directions. He urged the Corinthians to be generous (2 Cor. 8:7). He used Christ’s Gospel as a motivator. “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you by His poverty might become rich. … [The gift] is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have” (2 Cor. 8:9, 12). Paul cajoles the Corinthians to be ready. He urges them to set aside a little every Sunday. He brags about the poor “hicks from the sticks” in Macedonia who have given much to motivate the more cosmopolitan Corinthians to give more generously (2 Cor. 9:1–5). And Paul also writes all the great stewardship passages regarding the collection of mercy money for the suffering saints in Jerusalem.\nWhoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. … He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God. (2 Cor. 9:6–8, 10–11)\nIn God’s economy giving to the needy does not cause one to become poor. Quite the opposite. God pours on the blessings all the more.\nLike Jesus, Paul was ready to lay down his life for the mission. “I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus” (Acts 21:13). And so it happened. After he delivered the collection to the church in Jerusalem, Paul was falsely accused and imprisoned for breaking Jewish law. While in prison in Caesarea, he shared the Gospel with King Agrippa and the Roman governors who held him (Festus and Felix). As a Roman citizen, Paul appealed to Caesar as was his right. The harrowing journey is recorded by Luke with delightful detail.\nLuke ends Acts with Paul under house arrest in Rome: “He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance” (Acts 28:30–31). There’s actually a church built above the very house where Paul lived. The best traditions indicate that Paul was soon beheaded by Nero in A.D. 63 at a military barracks just outside the wall, at the end of the Appian Way.\nNext to the proclamation of Christ’s Gospel of free forgiveness, dearest to Paul’s heart was the mission of mercy. We do well to imitate him on both counts as individuals and as congregations and the broader church.\nRecently, we have been sharing stories of the mercy work the LCMS is carrying out here at home and around the world.

    "text": "by Ananya Gairola , Benzinga Staff Writer\nJanuary 9, 2025 10:49 PM | 2 min read | 1 Comment\nInternal documents from Meta Platforms, Inc. META reportedly indicate a policy designed to protect high-spending advertisers from automated content moderation.\nWhat Happened: The documents from 2023 reveal that Meta implemented “guardrails” to protect top advertisers, reported Financial Times.\nThese measures included suppressing automated detections based on advertising spend, with some accounts being reviewed manually instead.\nSee Also: Big Tech’s Date With Antitrust: Alphabet, Meta, Amazon Brace For Legal Showdowns In 2025\nA group termed “P95 spenders,” spending over $1,500 daily, were noted as exempt from standard advertising restrictions, the report noted.\nMeta’s spokesperson, Ryan Daniels , refuted the report, stating it was “simply inaccurate” and based on a selective interpretation of the documents.\nMeta acknowledged using “higher spend” as a guardrail due to the potential impact of mistakenly removing high-reach ads.\nThe company maintained that all advertisers are subject to the same standards, with no exemptions from its rules, the report stated.\nMeta did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\nWhy It Matters: Advertising is a significant revenue source for Meta, contributing nearly $135 billion in 2023.\nIn October 2024, Meta reported third-quarter revenue of $40.59 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $40.29 billion. Ad impressions rose by 7% compared to the previous year, while the average price per ad increased by 11% year-over-year.\nThis revelation comes at a time when Meta is shifting its content moderation strategy . Earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a move towards a Community Notes style of moderation, similar to Elon Musk’s X .\nThis change follows a report that Meta’s platforms were promoting illegal gun silencers , despite policies against such ads.\nPrice Action: Meta’s stock fell by 1.16% on Thursday and dropped an additional 0.34% in after-hours trading, settling at $608.64. Despite the dip, the company’s shares have risen by 3.58% year-to-date, according to data from Benzinga Pro .\nImage via Shutterstock\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link .\nRead Next: Dana White Wanted Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg In Cage Fight, Now He’s On Meta’s Board Of Directors\nRead Next:\nApple’s 2025 Bull Case: Can It Deliver Without Riding The AI Wave?
