    "text": "Once a sanctuary from the city’s chaos, some New Yorkers claim parks have become danger zones amid a pilot program allowing e-bikes and e-scooters into green spaces.\nThe debate hit a high on Wednesday when dozens gathered near Central Park's entrance to demand the city end its pilot allowing legal the micromobility devices on park drives and greenways, saying the initiative is a threat to pedestrian safety.\nWhat You Need To Know Dozens rallied at Central Park calling for an end to a city e-vehicle pilot program allowing legal e-bikes and scooters onto park drives\nThe pilot began in June 2023 and is scheduled to run through May 31, 2025\nOpponents of the pilot program said e-vehicle users behave recklessly and have struck numerous pedestrians in parks Many in attendance said they had personally been struck or nearly hit by e-vehicles.\n“They speed, they look at their phone, they fly through red lights. They’re going to weave no matter what lane they’re in,” said Janet Schroeder, director of the NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance.\nThe pilot, which began in June 2023 and is scheduled to run through May 31, 2025, allows for e-bikes and e-scooters under 100 pounds to use park paths. Other motorized vehicles remain prohibited.\nCritics of the program described it is a “dangerous experiment” Wednesday and urged lawmakers to take action.\n“We don’t want e-bikes in the park because they’re not bicycles. They’re much heavier. They do much more damage,” said Schroeder.\nA bill under review by the City Council would ban e-vehicles from city parks altogether.\nIn response to growing safety concerns, a spokesperson for the parks department said in part: “We are continuing to gain insights and test new methods for how electric micromobility can be safely managed for the benefit of all park users, and how to prevent heavier vehicles like mopeds from being operated in parks.”",

Following a trail of evidence from fruit flies to mice to humans revealed that cannibalistic cells likely cause a rare human immunodeficiency. Now the discovery shows promise for enhancing an up-and-coming cancer treatment.\n“This paper takes us from very fundamental cell biology in a fly, to explaining a human disease and harnessing that knowledge for a cancer therapy,” said UC Santa Barbara’s Denise Montell. “Each one of those steps feels like a major discovery, but here they are, all in one paper.”\nResearchers in Montell’s lab published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and are now investigating the mechanisms and implications.\nAn ancient gene\nThe primary character in this story is a gene, Rac2, and the protein it encodes. Rac2 is one of three Rac genes in humans. “Rac is very ancient in evolution, so it must serve a fundamental function,” said senior author Montell, Duggan Professor and Distinguished Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology.\nRac proteins help build a cell’s scaffolding, called the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is made of dynamic filaments that allow cells to maintain their shape or deform, as needed. In 1996, while studying a small group of cells in the fruit fly ovary, Montell determined that Rac proteins are instrumental in cell movement. Since then, it has become clear that Rac is a nearly universal regulator of cell motility in animal cells.\nBack in the ‘90s, she noticed that a hyperactive form of the Rac1 protein, expressed in only a few cells in a fly’s egg chamber, destroyed the whole tissue. “Just expressing this active Rac in six to eight cells kills the entire tissue, which is composed of about 900 cells,” explained lead author Abhinava Mishra, a project scientist in Montell’s lab.\nWhy did this happen? How does it work? “This was our 25-year-old cold case,” Montell said.\nA few years ago, evidence began to mount implicating cell eating, also known as cannibalism, in tissue destruction. There’s a step in normal fly egg development where certain cells similar to the border cells consume their neighbors because they are no longer needed. Indeed, cellular cannibalism is not as rare as you might expect: Millions of old red blood cells are eliminated from the human body this way every second.\nRac2 is one component of the complex eating process. Rac helps the eating cell to envelop its target. The team was curious if a hyperactive form of the protein was causing border cells to prematurely consume their neighbors.\nFor this to occur, the border cells need to recognize their targets, which requires a particular receptor. Indeed, when Mishra blocked this receptor, the border cells expressing activated Rac didn’t consume their neighbors, and the egg chamber remained alive and healthy.\n“Our 25-year-old cold case was solved, and that was very satisfying for us,” Montell exclaimed. “But this is a fairly niche area of Drosophila egg development.” The implications would soon grow, though.\nA mysterious immune condition\nAround the time that her lab made their breakthrough, Montell caught wind of an intriguing study in the journal Blood. This paper found that three unrelated people suffering from recurrent infections had the exact same mutation, which hyperactivates Rac2, a Rac protein produced in blood cells. She suspected her lab’s recent revelation in fruit flies might shed light on this enigma.\nThe patients’ mutation was just mildly activating, and yet it was enough that they all suffered from multiple infections and ultimately needed bone marrow transplants. Blood tests revealed that these patients had nearly no T cells, a specialized kind of white blood cells crucial to the immune system. The team at the National Institutes of Health inserted the Rac2 mutation into mice and found the same mysterious loss of T cells. They also found that the T cells with hyperactive Rac developed normally in the animals’ bone marrow, and migrated to the thymus, where they continued to mature without incident. But then they just seemed to disappear. So, the paper ended with a mystery: what was causing the T cells to disappear?\nThe authors of that journal study had noticed that many of the patients’ neutrophils — another type of white blood cell — were enlarged. They seemed to be consuming quite a lot of material, unusual behavior in an otherwise healthy person.\nMontell wondered if the patients’ T cells were disappearing because their innate immune cells like neutrophils with active Rac2 were eating them, much like the fruit fly border cells with active Rac were eating the egg chamber. Her team turned their attention to macrophages — the neutrophil’s more voracious counterpart — to investigate. Mishra cultured human macrophages with and without hyperactive Rac2 together with T cells. He observed that macrophages with hyperactive Rac consumed more cells, confirming the group’s hypothesis from their work with fruit flies.\nTo test whether this might cause the observed immunodeficiency, co-author Melanie Rodriguez (a graduate student in Montell’s lab) took bone marrow samples from mice with the same hyperactive Rac2 mutation found in the patients. She then grew the marrow stem cells into macrophages, and performed a similar experiment to Mishra, but this time mixing both macrophages and T cells with and without the Rac2 mutation.\nShe found that macrophages with active Rac2 consumed significantly more T-cells than their normal counterparts. However, T-cells with active Rac2 were also more vulnerable to consumption from either kind of macrophage. So the most likely explanation for the patients’ missing T cells was a combination of increased consumption by macrophages as well as increased vulnerability of the T cells themselves. A human medical mystery was solved based on fundamental observations in fruit flies.\nHarnessing haywire cells\nThe implications of these insights expanded in January 2020, when co-author Meghan Morrissey interviewed for a faculty position at UCSB. In her talk she described programming macrophages to eat cancer cells as a novel treatment for the disease, an approach called CAR-M. Morrissey had found that adding a CAR receptor to macrophages promoted this behavior. But it was also clear that inducing the macrophages to eat more would make the approach more effective — especially if they would specifically consume, and kill, entire cancer cells .\nWell, if there was one thing that Montell and her lab had learned, it was how to make macrophages eat and kill whole, living cells. So they collaborated with Morrissey, now an assistant professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology, to determine if adding activated Rac2 would increase the effectiveness of the CAR-M approach.\nRodriguez grew macrophages from the bone marrow of normal and mutant mice with activated Rac2. In each of these groups, Morrissey expressed either a dummy receptor or the CAR receptor, which recognizes B cells (another type of white blood cell). They found that the normal and hyperactive Rac cells with the dummy receptors did not eat many B cell targets. The normal macrophages with CAR receptors consumed far more B cells, as Morrissey had previously shown. However the macrophages with both hyperactive Rac and the CAR receptors ate twice-again as many B cells as the CAR-only group. Activated Rac2 also seemed to increase the number of so-called “super eaters” — ravenous macrophages that eat and kill multiple cancer cells.\nThe results made it clear that activated Rac and the receptor were both necessary for the enhanced effect. “If you add active Rac without the right receptor, it doesn’t do anything,” Montell explained.\nThis level of control is good news for any potential treatments, because it would give doctors a way to focus the modified macrophages’ attack on cancerous cells. Clinicians hopefully won’t need to worry about the engineered cells eating the patient’s T-cells either, because the T-cells wouldn’t have the active Rac2 mutation making them more vulnerable to this, as Rodriguez had previously discovered.\nThere is a current cancer treatment called CAR-T, which uses the CAR receptor and a patient’s own T-cells to attack and destroy cancers. It is highly effective against some cancers, but there are many that do not respond. CAR-M,a newer cousin to CAR-T, has recently entered into clinical trials in humans and so far seems safe. Montell and her group are interested in harnessing Rac-enhanced CAR macrophages to increase the efficacy of CAR-M treatments. They’ve filed a provisional patent for the technique — which they call RaceCAR-M — and are inviting biotech companies to partner in further developing the approach.\nThis new multifaceted paper raises both basic science and practical questions, which the lab has begun to tackle. They’re investigating whether the technique, which is so effective in the lab, will also work in freshly collected human immune cells and in animal cancer models, in mice and zebrafish. The team is also exploring how Rac2 is making this all happen at the molecular level, deep inside the cells.\nFurther down the line, Montell wants to know how many kinds of cancer the RaceCAR-M treatment might successfully target. For comparison, CAR-T has been effective against cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, but not against solid-tumor cancers like breast, lung or colon.\nThe results have amazed Montell, an esteemed cell biologist with well over 100 papers to her name. “This is my favorite paper so far,” she said.\n“We had this 25-year-old cold case in fruit flies, and we solved it,” Montell added. “And that helped us solve the mystery of an unexplained human immunodeficiency. And then we harnessed that knowledge to enhance a potential cancer immunotherapy.\n“It was just one mystery after another, and Rac turned out to be the answer to each of them.”\nYou can hear more about the path from fruit flies to potential cancer treatment in Montell’s SNPets interview with the Genetics Society of America, episodes 4-6.\nJournal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\nDOI\n10.1073/pnas.2310221120\nArticle Title\nHyperactive Rac stimulates cannibalism of living target cells and enhances CAR-M-mediated cancer cell killing\nArticle Publication Date\n18-Dec-2023",

L'ONU refuse de travailler avec cette organisation faute de garanties sur sa neutralité.\nTir de drone meurtrier\nNombre des distributions de la GHF ont donné lieu à des scènes meurtrières près de ses sites.\nL'hôpital Al-Awda du camp de Nousseirat (centre) a encore fait état tôt jeudi de quatre Palestiniens tués et 100 blessés lors d'une attaque par un drone israélien sur un rassemblement près d'un centre de l'organisation.\nCompte tenu des restrictions imposées aux médias par Israël à Gaza et des difficultés d'accès sur le terrain en guerre, l'AFP n'est pas en mesure de vérifier de manière indépendante les informations en provenance du territoire, notamment les bilans des morts palestiniens.\nL'armée israélienne a intensifié le 17 mai son offensive à Gaza, dans le but affiché de libérer les derniers otages du 7-Octobre, prendre le contrôle de l'ensemble du petit territoire coincé entre Israël, l'Egypte et la Méditerranée, et anéantir le Hamas qui y a pris le pouvoir en 2007.\nAlors que le gouvernement de Benjamin Netanyahu, l'un des plus à droite de l'histoire d'Israël, risquait de chuter, le Parlement a rejeté jeudi d'une courte majorité un projet de loi de l'opposition visant à sa dissolution.\nRéunion de l'Assemblée générale de l'ONU\nM. Netanyahu fait cependant face à une pression internationale accrue pour mettre fin à la guerre à Gaza et rouvrir les vannes humanitaires dans le territoire, où les quelque 2,4 millions d'habitants sont menacés de famine selon l'ONU.\nDisant vouloir \"briser le blocus israélien\", 12 militants dont la Suédoise Greta Thunberg ont tenté d'approcher Gaza, mais leur voilier a été intercepté lundi par la marine israélienne.\nQuatre militants français pro-palestiniens encore retenus en Israël, dont l'eurodéputée de gauche radicale Rima Hassan, doivent être expulsés jeudi soir et vendredi, selon la diplomatie française\nGreta Thunberg a été expulsée vers la Suède.

    "title": "These Are the 4 Zodiac Signs Most Likely to Be ‘Toxic’ Exes",
    "text": "Breakups are never easy, but some zodiac signs are known for leaving a lasting impression—often in ways that aren’t exactly positive. Whether it’s due to their intense emotions, stubborn nature, or difficulty in letting go, certain signs are more likely to earn the title of a “toxic” ex. Here are the four zodiac signs most likely to fit that description.\n1. Scorpio (October 23 – November 21) Scorpios are intense, passionate, and fiercely loyal—qualities that make them formidable partners. However, when a relationship ends, that intensity can quickly turn into something more sinister. Scorpios are known for their ability to hold grudges, and they’re not afraid to seek revenge if they feel wronged. Their tendency to obsess over past relationships can make it difficult for them to move on, and they might engage in manipulative or controlling behaviors to maintain a connection with their ex. If you’ve crossed a Scorpio, be prepared for the possibility of some post-breakup drama. For those dealing with emotional stress after a breakup, a calming essential oil diffuser can help create a peaceful environment to help you focus on healing.\n2. Leo (July 23 – August 22) Leos love to be the center of attention, and when a relationship ends, they often struggle with the loss of that spotlight. Their pride and ego can make it hard for them to accept that the relationship is over, leading them to act out in ways that keep them at the forefront of their ex’s mind. Leos might engage in dramatic displays or seek to make their ex jealous by flaunting a new relationship. Their need for validation can drive them to stay involved in their ex’s life, even when it’s time to move on. To regain confidence after a breakup, a motivational journal could be an empowering tool to help reclaim your self-worth and refocus your energy.\n3. Taurus (April 20 – May 20) Taurus is known for being stubborn, and this trait often extends to their relationships. When a Taurus falls in love, they commit deeply, and letting go isn’t something they do easily. After a breakup, a Taurus might cling to the idea of reconciliation, refusing to accept that the relationship is truly over. Their possessiveness can lead them to hold on to memories, belongings, or even the hope of getting back together, long after it’s healthy to do so. To help with the process of moving on, consider a guided self-help book that offers strategies for letting go and building a new future.\n4. Cancer (June 21 – July 22) Cancers are deeply emotional and sensitive, and they invest a lot of themselves in their relationships. When a breakup occurs, their emotional world can be thrown into turmoil, leading them to act out in ways that aren’t always healthy. Cancers have a hard time letting go of the past, and their tendency to dwell on what could have been can turn into a toxic attachment. They might manipulate their ex with guilt or emotional appeals, hoping to reignite the relationship or simply to avoid the pain of moving on. For emotional support during a difficult time, an anxiety-relief weighted blanket could provide the comfort needed to help soothe emotional wounds.\nNot every breakup has to be toxic, but these four zodiac signs have traits that can make post-relationship life particularly challenging. Whether it’s Scorpio’s vengeful tendencies, Leo’s need for attention, Taurus’s stubbornness, or Cancer’s emotional attachment, these signs are more likely to struggle with letting go. If you find yourself dealing with a breakup involving one of these signs, it’s important to set clear boundaries and prioritize your own well-being as you move forward.\nIf you want over 200+ ideas, phrases, and text messages to drive your man wild with desire for you, make sure to check out my new program, Language of Desire.
