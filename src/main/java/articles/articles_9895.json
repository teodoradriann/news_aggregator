    "title": "How Much Coffee Consumption Elevates Heart Attack Risk ?",
    "text": "NEW DELHI (dpa-AFX) - A recent research, conducted by Zydus Medical College and Hospital in India, found that drinking too much coffee or any other caffeine-containing beverage could severely affect heart health.\nResearchers said that individuals who consume more than 400 mg of caffeine daily, equivalent to four cups of coffee, 10 cans of soda or two energy drinks, are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The risk is more elevated in those who consume over 600 mg of caffeine daily.\n'Due to its effect on the autonomic nervous system, regular caffeine consumption could put otherwise healthy individuals at risk of hypertension and other cardiovascular events,' said lead researcher Dr. Nency Kagathara with Zydus Medical College and Hospital.\nThe study, presented at the American College of Cardiology's Asia scientific conference, involved 92 healthy people aged between 18 and 45 years. The participants reported their coffee consumption, and then underwent a three-minute step test to check their heart health.\nResearchers found that about 20 percent of the participants consumed over 400 mg of caffeine daily, with higher consumption noted among women, people working in business and management roles, and individuals living in urban areas.\n'Regular caffeine consumption could disturb the parasympathetic system, leading to elevated blood pressure and heart rates,' Kagathara warned.\nThe parasympathetic system is often called the 'rest and digest' system as it conserves energy and promotes relaxation in the body. If the system gets disrupted, it could lead to severe physical and psychological issues due to the body's inability to get adequate rest.\n'Increasing awareness of these risks is vital to improve heart health for all,' the lead researcher emphasized.\nCopyright(c) 2024 RTTNews.com.

    "title": "Why Freshpet Stock Was Up 22% in December | The Motley Fool",
    "text": "Shares of pet food company Freshpet ( FRPT 0.78% ) were up 22.3% in December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence . The company didn't have news to report during the month. But Wall Street had plenty to say.\nMultiple analysts issued reports on Freshpet stock during December. Three of these were TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow, D.A. Davidson analyst Brian Holland, and Wells Fargo analyst Marc Torrente. This trio now recommends buying Freshpet stock.\nWhen three prominent analysts all recommend buying the same stock within a short period, it can boost investor confidence and, consequently, the stock price. And this appears to be what happened with Freshpet stock in December.\nWhat's going on with Freshpet? Freshpet is an ambitious idea: It's not easy to prepare pet food from fresh ingredients and get it into consumers' hands before it goes bad. It requires manufacturing and distribution scale to have any chance of being successful. But the company is increasingly proving to investors that it's up to the task.\nFinancial results for the third quarter of 2023 were reported back in November, so they didn't directly impact Freshpet's stock price in December. However, Q3 results showed a lot of promising things. Specifically, net sales are still growing like crazy, up 32.6% year over year in Q3. Moreover, the company's cash from operations is reaching record highs.\nFRPT Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts . TTM = trailing 12 months.\nThis combination shows Freshpet becoming more financially successful with greater scale. That's a good thing for investors, and it's unsurprising that Wall Street increasingly praised the company in December after letting these developments marinate for a bit.\nWhat to expect from Freshpet now Though Wall Street is growing more optimistic about Freshpet's business, it doesn't necessarily see much more upside with the stock. Of the nine analysts tracked by TipRanks, the average price target is $84.75 per share -- the stock is within 1% of this, as of this writing.\nThe analyst community might be thinking too short term. In the Q3 conference call, Freshpet CEO Billy Cyr reiterated its long-term goals. The company anticipates growing its top line by a 25% compound annual growth rate through 2027, reaching $1.8 billion in sales. At that scale, management believes it can achieve an 18% margin for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) .\nValuing a stock is a subjective process. But assuming a fair enterprise valuation was 20 times its EBITDA, Freshpet stock may have around 60% upside through 2027 if it hits its goals for the top and bottom lines. That might be enough to outperform the market.\nOf course, Freshpet may not hit its goals, and no one can predict what the stock's valuation will be, so take all of this with a grain of salt. However, for those who like this business, there are credible reasons to believe it can generate positive returns over the next few years at least.",

This innovative research aims to advance the study of oncology by creating synthetic patient data, thereby leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to overcome critical challenges, particularly in the study of rare cancers where traditional patient data is often unavailable or difficult to obtain.\nThe study, entitled, \" External Control Arm with Synthetic Real-world Data for Comparative Oncology using Single Trial Arm Evidence (ECLIPSE): A Case Study using Lung-MAP S1400I \" is led by Dr. Winson Cheung, Medical Advisor at Inka Health and Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary, and brought together an esteemed team of oncology experts, including Inka Health co-founders Dr. Paul Arora and Dr. Alind Gupta, along with a consortium of world-renowned cancer researchers and private sector partners (Subsalt and Quantify Health). This exciting initiative seeks to develop synthetic patient cohorts using AI technology, a core element of digital twin technology, to address gaps in oncology research and accelerate clinical trial design by quickly generating comparator arms for trials. The Company believes that this is particularly critical in the rare cancer setting where randomizing patients to control arms (comparison groups without the new treatment) 2 is often infeasible. Ultimately, this approach aims to improve the pace and effectiveness of cancer treatments.\nLesen Sie auch Wieder zugeschlagen Cathie Wood setzt auf Tempus AI – So will sie vom KI-Boom profitieren! gestern 14:00 Aktie volatil Evotec: Die Finanzchefin schmeißt schon wieder hin! 26.02.25, 12:12 Erwartungen verfehlt Cathie Wood greift schon wieder daneben: KI-Aktie stürzt nach Zahlen ab! 25.02.25, 11:55 Räumliche Biologie?

Looking back on the past year with his Russian counterpart, the Chinese president estimated that “the material bases and in public opinion of our relationship have become stronger”, according to the state channel CCTV.\n“In the face of changes not seen in a century and a turbulent regional and international situation, China-Russia relations have maintained healthy and stable development and progressed steadily in the right direction,” Xi said. “Under our joint leadership, mutual political trust between the two sides has deepened, our strategic coordination has been strengthened, and mutually beneficial cooperation has continued to produce new results,” he added.\nPutin, a “good friend”\nThe volume of bilateral trade has exceeded $200 billion, ahead of targets, he further stressed. China, he said, looks forward to celebrating the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations in 2024. During a visit to Beijing earlier in December by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Xi had said that maintaining close relations with Moscow was a “strategic choice.”\nThe two allies strengthened their ties as Western countries turned their backs on Moscow following the invasion of Ukraine. Both regimes also emphasize the importance of the personal relationship between the two leaders, with Xi calling Putin a “good friend.”\nRead more: \"The Crimes of Our Mother\" Netflix-Doku: American Woman Found Guilty of Murdering Her Children in Boise, Idaho\nNever miss any news\nTo stay informed on your favorite themes and not miss any news, subscribe to our newsletter and receive the essential news of the day directly in your mailbox every day.\n(AFP)\n1704025356\n#Diplomacy #Tie #Beijing #Moscow #strengthened",

    "text": "Welcome to Start TODAY. Sign up for our Start TODAY newsletter to receive daily inspiration sent to your inbox — and join us on Instagram ! Did you set a resolution to make your health a priority in 2024? We took the first week of the new year as a buffer week — easing back into some healthy habits and getting our head in the game after the holiday season. Now it’s time to hit the ground running — or walking. When it comes to starting a fitness routine, walking is one of the easiest places to start and it delivers some major mental and physical health benefits . That’s why we’re starting the new year strong by hitting the pavement. Your goal? Walk 100 miles in 31 days. >>Download a printable calendar Logging 100 miles in one month may sound ambitious — and it is! — but if you break down the numbers you’ll see it is a totally doable goal. One mile is about 2,000 steps. So, if you’re spreading your mileage out evenly over the 31-day period, that comes out to about 6,500 steps a day, which is well below the 8,000-10,000 steps goal many health experts encourage . Plus, we’re tracking all movement throughout the day. That means it’s not only the walks you take for exercise, but the steps you take commuting to work, doing chores around the house and running errands. If there are days you fall short, that’s OK! Take a longer walk over the weekend or plan something active that will help you get in more steps, like hiking with your family, walking the farmer’s market or grabbing coffee with a friend and walking through the park. Why are we focused on walking? From improving your heart health and circulation to aiding in weight loss and boosting your mood, walking may just be the easiest way to improve our health. According to research , moderate-intensity walking and vigorous-intensity running yielded similar reductions in risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and heart disease. Another study showed that people who stuck with a walking program had significant improvements in blood pressure, slowing of resting heart rate, reduction of body fat and body weight, reduced cholesterol and improved depression scores. It’s also especially smart to include walking in your routine this time of year, when dark days can have us feeling down. Studies show walking releases endorphins that can boost your mood improves, and that walking decreases symptoms of stress 00567-4/fulltext), like anxiety, sadness, fatigue, and lack of motivation. Walking outdoors can be dicey this time of year. For days when the weather doesn’t cooperate, I’ve put together these fun indoor walking workouts that will help you rack up steps without even leaving the house.

    "text": "South Korea- /\nEntertainment- /\n- KOSDAQ:A289220\nRisks Still Elevated At These Prices As GIANTSTEP Inc. (KOSDAQ:289220) Shares Dive 25%\nGIANTSTEP Inc. (KOSDAQ:289220) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 25% share price drop in the last month. For any long-term shareholders, the last month ends a year to forget by locking in a 53% share price decline.\nIn spite of the heavy fall in price, you could still be forgiven for thinking GIANTSTEP is a stock not worth researching with a price-to-sales ratios (or \"P/S\") of 2.1x, considering almost half the companies in Korea's Entertainment industry have P/S ratios below 1.5x. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/S.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n View our latest analysis for GIANTSTEP\nHow Has GIANTSTEP Performed Recently?\nThe revenue growth achieved at GIANTSTEP over the last year would be more than acceptable for most companies. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this respectable revenue growth will be enough to outperform the broader industry in the near future. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\nWe don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out ourfree report on GIANTSTEP'searnings, revenue and cash flow.\nHow Is GIANTSTEP's Revenue Growth Trending?\nIn order to justify its P/S ratio, GIANTSTEP would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the industry.\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew revenue by an impressive 18% last year. Pleasingly, revenue has also lifted 51% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenue over that time.\nWeighing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory against the broader industry's one-year forecast for expansion of 16% shows it's about the same on an annualised basis.\nWith this in mind, we find it intriguing that GIANTSTEP's P/S exceeds that of its industry peers. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than recent times would indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as a continuation of recent revenue trends would weigh down the share price eventually.\nThe Bottom Line On GIANTSTEP's P/S\nDespite the recent share price weakness, GIANTSTEP's P/S remains higher than most other companies in the industry. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\nOur look into GIANTSTEP has shown that it currently trades on a higher than expected P/S since its recent three-year growth is only in line with the wider industry forecast. When we see average revenue with industry-like growth combined with a high P/S, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, bringing the P/S back in line with the industry too. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\nDon't forget that there may be other risks.

    "text": "The Golden Bachelor ’s Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist kept things traditional amid their wedding at La Quinta Resort & Club on Thursday, January 4, and even stayed in separate bungalows on the property, an insider exclusively tells Life & Style .\nNicole Trigg , a resident of La Quinta, scoped out the scene ahead of the big event and dishes to Life & Style that Gerry, 72, and Theresa, 70, stayed “pretty far away from each other” while at the Palm Springs, California location.\n“[Gerry] was staying up by the bungalows that were by the valet,” Nicole, who works in the floral space and owns Botanical Verbiage, details. “[Theresa] … was staying at the bungalows in the very back,” she says, adding that the newlyweds “came out together” ahead of their big day and enjoyed mutual time at the spa.\nCourtesy of Nicole Trigg The golden couple said “I do” in front of family, friends, Bachelor Nation favorites and a multitude of fans during the televised nuptials . Theresa stunned in a mermaid-fitted gown , while Gerry looked dapper in a tuxedo.\nThe bride exchanged her vows first, telling the Golden Bachelor leading man that she felt as though she’d known him “all [her] life.” Gerry followed suit, telling Theresa that he admired her strength and independence. To top off the special event, Susan Noles – a Golden Bachelor contestant – officiated !\nWhat Was on Golden Bachelor’s Gerry and Theresa's Wedding Registry? The La Quinta Resort was decorated to the nines, and stunning floral arrangements, drapery and candles adorned the ceremony space.\nDisney/John & Joseph Photography Ahead of the wedding, Theresa’s daughter, Jen Woolston , dished exclusively to Life & Style about the ceremony, revealing that the lovebirds were “so excited” for their big day.\n“First of all, I work in weddings. I love weddings. And then this is like the ultimate wedding you know that Mindy Weiss is planning and everything,” Jen told Life & Style . “There’s a lot of decisions to make pretty much every day. And you know, I can’t even imagine what it’s going to feel like to actually be there and see it all come to life. Even though we’re in the loop, I think it’s going to feel sort of like a big surprise, really.”\nDid Golden Bachelor’s Leslie Fhima Attend Gerry and Theresa's Wedding? On Theresa and Gerry’s celebrated occasion, Jen served as her mom’s maid of honor, and the couple’s blended family were front and center.\n “My daughter and his daughters are constantly on the phone together,” Theresa shared during a December 2023 interview. “We couldn’t have blended more beautifully together, the two families.” Gerry chimed in too, noting that “the daughters call each other sisters now” and “have a good time with each other.”\nThe duo are off to Italy for their honeymoon, waving goodbye to Palm Springs and welcoming their new reality as husband and wife.\nTags: Exclusive Gerry Turner The Golden Bachelor Theresa Nist",
