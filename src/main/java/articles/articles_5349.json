    "title": "Northern Cyprus' president criticizes UK over sending 700 more troops to bases on island",
    "text": "The president of Northern Cyprus on Thursday cautioned against the UK's decision to send 700 additional troops to its sovereign bases on the island, with Britain citing the need to evacuate its citizens from war-torn Lebanon. Ersin Tatar told Anadolu on Thursday that amid continuing attacks in Gaza and the risk of Israel launching a large-scale attack on Lebanon, the purpose of the UK sending an additional 700 troops to its sovereign bases on the island for evacuations could indicate the possibility of a regional war. Tatar cited Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's statement that the Greek Cypriot administration has become a base used by certain countries, especially in operations against Gaza, adding: \"My main assessment is that Britain's increase in the number of troops in its sovereign bases in Cyprus is within the framework of measures taken to spread an expected war in the region.\" Stressing that Türkiye is one of the guarantor states of the whole island of Cyprus and that the Greeks' transformation of the island into a military base for foreign countries is both contrary to international agreements and unacceptable, Tatar said: \"The recent continuous increase in the military presence of the UK and U.S. on Cyprus disturbs not only us but also the Greeks. We can see that they are uncomfortable from the public reactions and the news media. These are movements that need to be closely monitored, and we are following the developments together with Türkiye.\" Tatar underlined that the Greek Cypriot leadership should act more pragmatically on these issues, as by turning Cyprus into a military base used by many countries, the Greeks have sown caused instability in the Eastern Mediterranean and made the island the target of many Mideast-based groups. Saying the UK is accelerating its contingency plans to evacuate its citizens from Lebanon, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the Ministry of Defense would send 700 troops to its sovereign bases on Cyprus for possible evacuations. The British Foreign Ministry later confirmed that 700 troops were deployed to the island to support the possible evacuation of British citizens from nearby Lebanon. Britain has two bases on the island of Cyprus, Akrotiri and Dhekelia, both of them sovereign bases.",

    "text": "BILLINGS — Chronic wasting disease was detected for the first time in central Montana this season in a mule deer buck from hunting district 515 and a whitetail buck from HD 525, both harvested by hunters.\nCWD had not been found previously in these districts.\nThe mule deer from HD 515 was shot north of Columbus and the white-tailed deer from HD 525 was killed west of Nye. After testing protocol, both deer were tested twice to confirm the positive results.\nThroughout 2024 so far, nearly 9,000 CWD samples have been collected from deer, elk and moose across the state. A majority of the animals sampled were hunter-harvested but also included roadkill and CWD symptomatic animals. Of those tested so far, 321 were confirmed to have CWD.\nCWD is a contagious neurological disease that can infect deer, elk and moose. It is always fatal, and there is no known cure. It was first detected in Montana’s wild herds in 2017. The disease is known to exist in various regions of Montana, including multiple other hunting districts in south-central Montana.\nHunting is the primary tool for monitoring and managing the spread of CWD through testing of harvested animals. Hunters can also help slow the spread of CWD by disposing of animal carcasses properly after filling their tag. This includes leaving carcass remains at the kill site when possible or bagging the carcass and disposing of it in a Class II landfill.\nHunters can still get their harvested animals tested for CWD throughout the muzzleloader heritage season and the elk shoulder season. FWP has online resources for hunters to collect and submit samples themselves. Hunters can also have FWP staff test their animals at the Region 5 office in Billings (2300 Lake Elmo Dr.), Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call ahead at 406-247-2940 to ensure someone is available to collect your sample. Testing for CWD is free of charge and voluntary in most places in Montana.\nBozeman hunters can take their animals to the FWP office on South 19th Avenue.\nThere is no known transmission of CWD to humans. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hunters harvesting deer, elk or moose from an area where CWD is known to exist have their animal tested prior to consuming the meat and do not consume the meat if the animal tests positive.\nFor more information on CWD in Montana, visit fwp.mt.gov/cwd .\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters (0 Ratings)",

    "title": "„Ich hasse es\": Junge Mutter rechnet mit Erziehung von Millennials ab",
    "text": "„Ich hasse es“: Junge Mutter rechnet mit Erziehung von Millennials ab\nEine Mutter verkündet in einem Instagram-Video, dass sie bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung „hasst“. Ein Experte pflichtet ihr bei: „Ärger muss nicht getröstet werden“.\nMit einem Video Anfang April 2025 macht die Mutter und Instagramerin Elena Bridgers, die sich mit der Evolution der Mutterschaft beschäftigt, einige ihrer Fans wütend. Darin kritisiert sie den aktuellen Goldstandard der Erziehung, an den sich viele Eltern halten: bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung (engl. gentle parenting).\n„Hier sind drei Gründe, warum ich bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung hasse“, sagt Bridgers, die vor einigen Monaten versuchte, ihr Kind mit einer Jahrhunderte-alten Methode zum Gemüse essen zu bringen. Grund eins: Keine Kultur auf der Welt erziehe Kinder so, außer der Westen. Zweitens gebe es keine wirkliche wissenschaftliche Evidenz, die beweise, dass bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung die beste Methode sei.\nDrittens sei bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung „zu zeitintensiv“, sagt Bridgers. „Wer hat Zeit, auf die Knie zu gehen und jedes Gefühl des Kindes wertzuschätzen? Ich hab noch anderes zu tun“, sagt sie. In ihrer Erfahrung mache zu viel Beachtung das Verhalten trotziger Kinder noch schlimmer. „Kleinkind-Wutanfälle ignoriert man am besten.“\nWarum „extrem bedürfnisorientiertes Erziehen“ problematisch ist\nIn den Kommentaren unter Bridgers Instagram-Video sind einige ihrer Follower entsetzt. „Ich mag deinen Account, aber das enttäuscht mich jetzt“, schreibt eine Person. Ihrer Meinung nach sei die bei Millennials beliebte bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung „unglaublich“. Für einige fühlt sich ihre Kontroverse nach Clickbait an. „Ich liebe deine Videos, aber bedürfnisorientierte Erziehung hat nur deswegen Nachteile, weil die Menschen denken, es bedeutet, keine Grenzen zu setzen.“\nDie Therapeutin Melanie Hubermann bestätigt bei BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA, dass die Erziehungsmethode von einigen Eltern falsch verstanden wird. „Dieses extrem bedürfnisorientierte Erziehen bedeutet, die Kinder einfach machen zu lassen, wonach ihnen gerade ist. Sie sollen sich individuell entfalten. Wenn sie der Meinung sind, sie müssen ihren Freund prügeln, dann sollen sie das tun, um herauszufinden, wie sich das anfühlt“, erklärt sie.\nDas funktioniere nicht. „Wir müssen Kindern Werte vermitteln und Grenzen setzen“, sagt Hubermann. „Wir überfordern Kinder, wenn wir ihnen nicht die Welt altersgerecht kleinhalten – mithilfe von Struktur und Regeln.“\nBedürfnisorientierte Erziehung: „Ärger muss nicht getröstet werden“\nBedürfnisorientierte Erziehung ignoriere oft, dass auch Eltern Bedürfnisse hätten, ergänzt der Psychiater und Bindugsforscher Simon Meier aus Regensburg. „Bedürfnisse stehen immer in Konkurrenz zueinander. Kinder müssen lernen, dass sie nicht alleine auf diesem Planeten sind und ihre Bedürfnisse auch manchmal aufschieben müssen“, sagt er BuzzFeed News Deutschland.\nEr nimmt Eltern die Angst davor, Bindungsstörungen auszulösen, wenn sie den Wutanfall eines Kindes oder das Schreien ihres Babys einmal ignorieren. „In der Bindungsforschung wissen wir: entscheidend ist, was in 75 Prozent der Fälle passiert. Bindungssysteme sind plastisch, die verzeihen einiges.“ Je nach Alter müsse man den Kindern zumuten, ihre Bedürfnisse selbst zu befriedigen.\nNatürlich bräuchten Neugeborene mehr Bedürfnisbefriedigung, aber auch da sei es möglich, ein Kind ein paar Minuten ohne traumatische Folgen schreien zu lassen. Eltern sollten auf ihre Intuition hören und ihr Kind dann unterstützen, wenn es traurig ist, es aber auch mal alleine lassen, wenn es nur wütend ist. „Ärger muss nicht getröstet werden, ihn können schon kleine Kinder relativ gut regulieren“, sagt der Bindungsexperte und stützt damit Bridgers These, dass Wutanfälle bei Kindern auch mal ignoriert werden dürfen.",

    "title": "Alerta mundial: La Tierra perderá su oxígeno en mil millones de años, advierte la NASA - Exitosa Noticias",
    "text": "07/05/2025 / Exitosa Noticias / Mundo / Actualizado al 07/05/2025\nUn estudio científico de largo alcance, realizado por investigadores de la NASA en colaboración con la Universidad de Toho en Japón, ha proyectado un escenario preocupante para el futuro de la atmósfera terrestre.\nSegún simulaciones llevadas a cabo por Kazumi Ozaki y Christopher Reinhard, dentro de aproximadamente mil millones de años, el planeta dejará de ser habitable para formas de vida complejas debido a una pérdida progresiva e irreversible del oxígeno en la atmósfera.\nEl fenómeno está vinculado al incremento gradual de la luminosidad del Sol, un proceso natural en la evolución de las estrellas como la nuestra. Este aumento de energía afectará el equilibrio químico de la atmósfera terrestre, alterando los niveles de gases clave como el dióxido de carbono (CO₂), necesario para la fotosíntesis.\nCuando el CO₂ descienda a niveles críticamente bajos, las plantas no podrán seguir produciendo oxígeno. Como resultado, la atmósfera rica en oxígeno que actualmente sustenta la vida animal y humana desaparecerá, dando paso a una atmósfera similar a la de la Tierra primitiva, habitada solo por microorganismos anaeróbicos.\n¿Cómo ocurrirá el proceso de desoxigenación?\nSegún el modelo presentado, este proceso no será súbito, sino gradual. La disminución de CO₂ y la consiguiente interrupción de la fotosíntesis desencadenarán un ciclo de retroalimentación que hará cada vez más difícil la recuperación del oxígeno.\nLos primeros indicios de esta transformación podrían comenzar a observarse en unos pocos miles de años, con un incremento del metano atmosférico y un progresivo deterioro de la capa de ozono.\nLa atmósfera se volverá menos protectora contra la radiación solar, y el entorno terrestre se volverá hostil para la vida tal como la conocemos. Este lento cambio culminará con una Tierra árida y rocosa, similar a Marte o Venus, sin posibilidad de mantener ecosistemas complejos.\n¿Qué implicancias tiene para la búsqueda de vida en otros planetas?\nEl estudio también tiene importantes implicancias para la astrobiología. Tradicionalmente, la presencia de oxígeno se ha considerado un indicador fundamental de habitabilidad en otros mundos.\nSin embargo, los autores del estudio advierten que este gas puede estar presente solo durante ciertas fases del desarrollo planetario. Por tanto, su ausencia no debe interpretarse como una señal definitiva de que no hay vida.\nEste nuevo enfoque podría redefinir los criterios utilizados para identificar exoplanetas potencialmente habitables, ampliando el espectro de mundos que podrían albergar vida, aunque no cuenten con atmósferas similares a la de la Tierra actual.\nEl modelo presentado por NASA y la Universidad de Toho revela que la habitabilidad planetaria tiene un límite temporal definido. A medida que el Sol evoluciona, las condiciones químicas que permiten la vida compleja en la Tierra desaparecerán, transformando radicalmente el planeta.",

Habrá nubosidad de evolución diurna en los Pirineos, en el sistema Ibérico y Central por el paso de una vaguada que recorrerá de oeste a este la península y que dejará nubes de evolución y algún chubasco en la zona en los siguientes días.\nEn el área cantábrica se esperan intervalos nubosos, con posibilidad de precipitaciones débiles y en Alborán nubes bajas con alguna niebla costera.\nSe registrarán tormentas en la mitad nordeste, siendo más probables y localmente fuertes en Pirineos, en el interior de Cataluña y en la Ibérica sur, con aviso naranja por tormentas y granizo en Teruel y comarcas de Castellón, Barcelona y Girona; y aviso amarillo por tormentas y lluvias en otras comarcas en general del Levante y Cataluña.\nEn el Valle del Ebro y zonas de la meseta no se descartan tampoco tormentas secas aisladas.\nLas temperaturas descenderán en general este viernes en la Península y en las islas Baleares, de forma acusada las máximas en zonas del nordeste como en el valle del Ebro, pero continuarán significativamente elevadas en la mitad sur peninsular y en el interior sureste de Cataluña.\nDestacan los avisos naranjas o amarillos activos por temperaturas altas en comarcas de Andalucía, más concretamente en zonas de Málaga y Granada.\nSe superarán los 35 ºC en zonas del interior de la mitad sur y en las depresiones del nordeste peninsular, sin descartar tampoco puntos de Mallorca e incluso los 40 ºC en zonas del Guadalquivir. Las mínimas tampoco bajarán de los 25 ºC en el área mediterránea.\nSegún Núñez, es posible la presencia de calima en ambos archipiélagos y en el sudeste peninsular que irá remitiendo.\nEn Canarias se prevén intervalos de nubes bajas en la zona norte de las islas, con pocos cambios en las temperaturas, pero serán altas en el sur de Gran Canaria, sin descartar los 35 ºC en el sur del archipiélago.\nSoplará viento alisio moderado en Canarias, con intervalos de fuerte; en la Península predominarán vientos de componente norte en la mitad norte, en general flojos o moderados, con intervalos de fuerte en el Ampurdán. En el resto de la vertiente atlántica, Estrecho y Alborán soplarán vientos del oeste, con intervalos de poniente fuerte en el Estrecho.\nEl fin de semana habrá tiempo estable en la mayor parte del país, con cielos poco nubosos o despejados, salvo precipitaciones débiles y dispersas en el extremo norte peninsular, así como nubes de evolución diurna en el Pirineo y la Ibérica, con algún chubasco débil y que pueden ir acompañados de tormenta.\nLas temperaturas continuarán elevadas en la mitad sur y en la depresión del Ebro y el sur de las Islas Canarias. Las máximas tienden el domingo a aumentar, sobre todo en las vertientes atlánticas y cantábricas, el Ebro y en las islas Canarias, mientras se registrará un descenso en el área mediterránea.\nSe superarán los 35 ºC en el interior de la mitad sur y en la depresiones del noreste peninsular, sin descartar el sur de Canarias, e incluso en algunas zonas del Guadalquivir se pueden superar los 40 ºC.\nLas mínimas tampoco bajarán de los 25 ºC en el área mediterránea.\nLa próxima semana se prevé que continúe la situación estable y de altas temperaturas, con predominio de cielos poco nubosos.

You won’t make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.”\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n“I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,” he says. “We’re Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.”\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of “thin snow coverage” for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n“Rain’s the star of the show today,” Cypress Mountain’s update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a “blocking pattern” across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like “a wall.”\nHe said Environment Canada’s long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n“We may see potential for some snowfall,” Proctor says. “But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.",

    "text": "Erik ten Hag said he is the right person to lead [Manchester United](/football/team?id=360) out of their slump after [Nottingham Forest](/football/team?id=393) inflicted the team's ninth [Premier League](/football/league/_/name/ENG.1) defeat of the season on Saturday. United are nine points adrift of the top four and out of European competition as they head into 2024. The club will also undergo a change of football structure when INEOS complete their 25% investment with Premier League ratification in the weeks ahead. - [Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)](/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS) INEOS director of sport Dave Brailsford, who will be on a three-person football board when the deal is completed, watched [United lose 2-1 at Forest](/football/report/_/gameId/671230), but Ten Hag is convinced he can lead the team out of their difficult period. \"Of course, they [INEOS] know me and they know when I have the squad what is available then the results will be there,\" Ten Hag said. \"We have already proved against the top teams that we can go head to head. \"I am convinced and I have strong belief that we can get progress in this team and get more consistency than this moment. It is part of a project. \"We were over-performing last year, this year -- so far -- we are under-performing and we have to do better. We have to step up. I have to lead the process. \"I know when [injured] players return, I'm sure this side will be stronger. You have to be clear, clinical and analyse this.\" United lost at Forest after beating title-chasing [Aston Villa](/football/team?id=362) 3-2 at Old Trafford in midweek. Ten Hag's side also earned a 0-0 draw at [Liverpool](/football/team?id=364) this month, becoming the only team to avoid defeat at Anfield against Jurgen Klopp's team in the league this season prior to Arsenal's 2-2 draw last week. And Ten Hag admits that inconsistency is a big problem his side must overcome. \"One thing is clear, we are not consistent,\" he said. \"We can beat the best teams in the league but we also lose against the others and today was one of them.\"",
