    "title": "Touching: Holocaust survivor and evacuee from the north at the Western Wall",
    "text": "During World War II, Simon Hayat and his family miraculously escaped the clutches of the Nazis. Simon lived with his family in Rabat, Morocco at the time, and they were included in the deportation lists prepared by the Nazis for deportation to concentration camps. Just before the Germans arrived in the city, Allied forces arrived and saved Simon and his family. Since his immigration to Israel, Simon has lived with his family and children in the town of Shlomi on the northern border. When the war broke out, the town was evacuated, and Hayat was taken to the Hadassim nursing home in Beit She'an – where he stays to this day with his wife. Simon had one dream he wished to fulfill more fervently since the beginning of the war – to visit the Western Wall with his family. Due to his medical condition and the great distance, Simon has not visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem since the days of the Second Lebanon War in 2006 – about 18 years ago. The Ezer Mizion Association stepped in to help fulfill Simon's dream. The nursing department, along with the patient transportation and mobility department, brought Simon and his wife in a special ambulance from Beit She'an to the Western Wall plaza. Simon's extended family, who were also evacuated from northern towns, also came to the Western Wall and gathered together to fulfill Simon's wish. Simon was able to touch the stones of the Western Wall and pray, with the Western Wall Heritage Foundation also participating in organizing the emotional meeting. Hayat concluded with great excitement: \"Since the Second Lebanon War, I have not had the opportunity to come and pray at the Western Wall. This year, as we are out of our homes – I finally had the chance to come to the Wall and pray for the people of Israel during these difficult days. I also finally got to meet my extended family, who have been scattered throughout the country since the beginning of the war.\" \"We managed to defeat Hitler and the Nazi evil – we will also manage to defeat the evil of Sinwar and Hamas together. Being here today is part of our great victory.\" Naomi Mizrachi, manager of the Make-A-Wish Foundation at the Ezer Mizion association, stated \"Each wish fulfilled for a Holocaust survivor is a world unto itself. We see the happiness and joy on their faces when we arrive on-site and the impact that follows. After long days and years of being confined within the institute, they get moments of grace and comfort in their last years as we constantly work to fulfill more and more wishes for the Holocaust survivors living among us. This is a kindness we owe them.\"",

    "title": "Aptos Price Surges to $5.82 & Mantle Rebounds; BlockDAG Prepares to List on 10 CEXs-$20 Coin Value Next?",
    "text": "Things are looking quite favorable in the crypto market. Aptos’ price has surged to $5.82, thanks to an unofficial community takeover (CTO). Trading activity and buying interest have also increased as the coin continues to capture the attention of influencers. Meanwhile, MNT has reemerged after a short period of dip, with the latest Mantle price analysis hinting at a smooth upward path.\nAdding to the excitement, BlockDAG (BDAG), which has raised over $199 million in presale with over 18.6 billion coins sold, is set to list on 10 major Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). These highly awaited listings are set to boost its current batch 27 price of $0.0248 per coin to a whopping $20 by 2027, unlocking massive ROIs for holders who join the network’s presale now!\nCommunity Takeover Triggers Aptos Price Surge\nFollowing a recent Aptos price surge, APT is currently residing at $5.82. And guess what triggered it? An unofficial community takeover (CTO) led by crypto influencer BuzzlamicJihad. Most community takeover happens with abandoned projects, but Aptos is actively being developed.\nThe CTO started in October 2024, with people using memes and catchphrases like “Aptos lookin’ good here,” which spiked social media engagement and buying interest. This Aptos price surge comes after hitting a low of $5.50, a price level strongly defended by buyers. Trading activity has spiked by 13.42% and continues to get a great deal of attention from influencers. And the new CEO, Avery Ching is in full support of this, referring to BuzzlamicJihad as the “GOAT.”\nMantle Price Analysis: What’s Next After a 3.76% Surge?\nDespite a brief dip, Mantle (MNT) has rebounded, showcasing resilience with a 3.76% price increase and $121.4 million in trading volume over the past 24 hours. With a market cap of $3.557 billion, and market dominance of 0.1157%, Mantle is slowly but surely marking its presence in the crypto world.\nAdditionally, Mantle’s price analysis signals the potential for continued growth, with SMA and RSI supporting this possibility. If Mantle holds firm against the resistance level of $1.2730, it could soar high and set new records.\nBlockDAG’s CEX Listings Near—Here’s What $20 Forecast Means for Holders\nThere is hardly a way that a crypto enthusiast hasn’t heard about BlockDAG. This emerging altcoin giant has been garnering consistent institutional confidence since its presale began—raising $199 million and selling over 18.6 billion coins, marking its position as a breakout crypto of this year.\nNow, things are about to take an exciting new turn for BlockDAG buyers as the coin prepares to launch on 10 major Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). Having made an impressive mark in the crypto world already, BDAG will likely witness mass adoption once it lists on these exchanges, expanding its reach to millions of traders worldwide. This widespread adoption will also significantly boost the credibility and liquidity of the coin, as the BDAG community expands.\nThe price of BlockDAG has already seen impressive growth so far, experiencing a 2380% jump since its first crypto presale batch. But the real game is just about to begin. The coin is currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27 and once it launches its mainnet in 2025, its price is set to surge significantly, potentially even reaching $20 by 2027.\nThese numbers highlight how quickly BDAG is growing, with no signs of slowing down. This message is perfectly captured in the network’s newly released CGI video, where a laser shoots into the sky—a metaphor for BDAG’s ambition to go beyond limits, aiming for the sky—or perhaps even the Moon!\nDecision Time\nThe Aptos price surge continues to gain steam, with an increase in traction on social media and buying interest. Meanwhile, Mantle is establishing a presence in the crypto market, with a market dominance of 0.1157%. To make things better for Mantle, price analysis suggests continued bullish momentum for the coin.\nWhile established players see an upward trend, BlockDAG, which has raised over $199 million across just 27 presale batches, is set to accelerate its journey by listing on 10 major CEXs. While early adopters of this breakout crypto are already seeing a 2380% price surge, listing on CEXs could further take its price to $20 in the next two years. So for crypto enthusiasts looking for the next big thing, BlockDAG is the perfect opportunity—especially while it’s still priced at just $0.0248 per coin!\nDisclaimer: TheNewsCrypto does not endorse any content on this page.

    "text": "Haiti's Vital Port Shuts Down Amid Escalating Gang Attacks Access to a critical port in Port-au-Prince is closed due to gang-related violence. Caribbean Port Services shut down barriers, affecting land-based traffic from Sept. 26 to Sept. 29. The shuttering comes amid increased kidnappings and threats to incoming ships, exacerbating Haiti's instability and economic woes. [Devdiscourse News Desk](https://www.devdiscourse.com/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 27-09-2024 03:20 IST | Created: 27-09-2024 03:20 IST Land access to a vital supply port in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince is closed off after attacks by armed gangs, operator Caribbean Port Services (CPS) announced on Thursday. CPS stated that barriers would be shuttered for all land-based traffic from Sept. 26 to Sept. 29, to enable the army and national police to secure the area. A shipping official revealed that ships faced shooting incidents, preventing them from docking and unloading containers. Authorities also reported the kidnapping of two Filipino crew members from a cargo vessel. During the United Nations General Assembly this week, Haitian leaders highlighted the deteriorating security situation despite the partial deployment of a U.N.-backed security force. Armed gangs, predominantly equipped with U.S. weapons, now control most of Port-au-Prince and are spreading to adjacent areas. Over 700,000 people in Haiti have been internally displaced, nearly double the figure from six months ago, as food prices and hunger rates soar. Haiti's transition council president, Edgard Leblanc Fils, at the U.N. General Assembly, called the situation a national threat and urged the Security Council to enhance the Kenyan-led security force into a formal peacekeeping mission. Earlier this year, Haiti's main seaports and international airport shut down for nearly three months when violence peaked in February, causing widespread chaos including prison breaks and the prime minister's resignation.

    "title": "Mental Health Toll From COVID Epidemic Continues, by Chuck Norris | Creators Syndicate",
    "text": "\"As one day blurs into the next and one month into another, the consequences of sustained stress can rise to the surface in subtle ways,\" I wrote roughly two years ago at the dawning of the New Year of 2022. I was speaking about the then effects coming out of two long years of pandemic life and of various expert assessments of the negative consequences of prolonged stresses it has brought on and the call for keeping optimism alive. As we now stand at the threshold of 2024, I thought it might be of value to look back at the assessments of two years ago to see how they stack up with current perspectives of where we are at today. In commenting to The New York Times on the struggles many people were experiencing during the long-haul of the pandemic, organizational psychologist Adam Grant made the following observation: \"It wasn't burnout — we still had energy,\" he says. \"It wasn't depression — we didn't feel hopeless. We just felt somewhat joyless and aimless... It turns out there's a name for that: languishing ... a sense of stagnation and emptiness. And it might be the dominant emotion of 2021.\" Grant goes on to label languishing as \"the neglected middle child of mental health.\" It fills a void but is given little attention. \"You don't have symptoms of mental illness, but you're not the picture of mental health either. You're not functioning at full capacity,\" he concludes. \"'Not depressed' doesn't mean you're not struggling. 'Not burned out' doesn't mean you're fired up. By acknowledging that so many of us are languishing, we can start giving voice to quiet despair and lighting a path out of the void... It appears to be more common than major depression — and in some ways it may be a bigger risk factor for mental illness.\" In a contribution to an NPR New Year advice series focused on 2022, producer and podcaster TK Dutes points out the damaging role that \"the hypercritical mental chorus we call negative self-talk\" was creating mental roadblocks to positive actions and mental well-being. On that subject, the Mayo Clinic adds that \"if the thoughts that run through your head are mostly negative, your outlook on life is more likely pessimistic... Such an outlook can magnify the negative aspects of a situation and create a condition where you automatically anticipate the worst.\" Daisy Fancourt, an associate professor at University College London and a leader of a 2022 University College London COVID-19 Social Study, says \"if there's any silver lining to the psychological upheaval of the pandemic, it's greater mental health literacy. People were forced to grapple with their own understanding of mental health... their ability to recognize their own symptoms and feelings or potential mental health problems. COVID has been its own campaign about mental health.\" So where has this campaign focusing on mental health led us? Apparently, we are now squarely in the grips of a new epidemic. It is \"seeping in at the corners of our communities,\" writes USA Today's Adrianna Rodriguez. \"It can't be treated using traditional therapies even though it has debilitating and even deadly consequences.\" It \"is by no means new to the human experience. But experts say it has worsened in recent years,\" she adds. The problem she speaks of is loneliness. As U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recently explained to USA Today, \"As researchers track record levels of self-reported loneliness, public health leaders are banding together to develop a public health framework to address the epidemic. ... It is detrimental to mental and physical health, leading to an increased risk of heart disease, dementia, stroke, and premature death.\" According to Dr. Jeremy Nobel, founder of The Foundation for Art and Healing, a nonprofit that addresses public health concerns through creative expression, \"The world is becoming lonelier and there's some very, very worrisome consequences. ... It won't just make you miserable, but loneliness will kill you,\" he concludes. It is a universal human experience, notes Murthy. \"It occurs when the connections a person needs in life are greater than the connections they have. Because it's so subjective, not everyone feels loneliness the same way or for the same reason.\" \"Even those who have plenty of friends can experience loneliness,\" reports Rodriguez. \"It can also be exacerbated by technology taking the place of human interaction and it often pushes us to distance ourselves from others at a time when we need support most.\" Nobel, who is also on the faculty at Harvard Medical School and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, adds that loneliness is experienced throughout a person's lifespan. \"It can spiral as a result of trauma, illness and the effects of aging. It can also be exacerbated by technology taking the place of human interaction, which helps explain why young people report the highest rates of loneliness.\" These factors also make it difficult to address \"as a population health topic because it's so varied based on the circumstances individuals have to navigate.\" In a recent New York Times report, Izzy Boring, 21, a college student in Oregon, points out that what her generation considers connection — a small screen in our hands — \"doesn't have anything to do with connecting at all. ... Genuine connection is found in being human and giving room for others to be human alongside you,\" she says. What's remarkable is how pervasive loneliness is, the surgeon general tells the Times. \"One in 2 adults in the U.S. are living with measurable levels of loneliness — it's a broader swath of the population than the number of people with diabetes ... Tackling the nation's loneliness epidemic will require that all sectors of society work together with a common goal,\" says Murthy. \"We can't take on a lot of these challenges alone. We need to be together. We need to be connected. That's what strengthening the social fabric in our lives and communities is all about.\" Write to Chuck Norris ( [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) with your questions about health and fitness.

    "text": "Domenica 23 torna il fiore all'occhiello della della società Genova 1913: partenza e arrivo nel mitico velodromo milanese\nIl grande raduno di domenica prossima è il fiore all’occhiello della società Genova 1913, quella con i colori arancio e blu (simili al Genoa calcio, ma è solo una coincidenza, perché il riferimento è al rione Porta Genova di Milano), che a gennaio ha compiuto 112 anni. Il 23 marzo si svolgerà la settima edizione della Randonnée “Gran Milan”, per la seconda volta con a fianco anche il nome di “Vigorelli”: oltre 350 iscritti fra soci “genovini” e amatori di altre società provenienti da tutta Italia. Per il secondo anno consecutivo, appunto, partenza dentro al mitico velodromo Vigorelli, dove sulla pista velocissima in legno, quella dei record dell’ora, si sono sfidati i più blasonati campioni del ciclismo mondiale. Ma una delle grandi novità di quest’anno sarà l’arrivo: di nuovo dentro al Tempio del ciclismo milanese con il suono della leggendaria campanella dell’ultimo giro. Inoltre, la possibilità per i non ciclisti, di effettuare una visita guidata al velodromo Vigorelli.\nICONA\n—È la cosa che più fa esultare il presidente dell’antica società milanese, Giancarlo Scalmana, un ultraottantenne in splendida forma, e soprattutto un appassionato con una carriera da amatore di tutto rispetto: \"Una decina di anni fa il FAI organizzava delle visite guidate all’interno del Vigorelli, con un successo di pubblico notevole, anche di persone non proprio amanti del ciclismo. Perché il Vigorelli, a Milano, è un monumento iconico normalmente chiuso al pubblico. Per questo abbiamo pensato di riproporre, in scala minore, la medesima formula. I partecipanti, mentre i ciclisti pedaleranno in diversi percorsi in Brianza, verranno condotti da guide esperte del Comitato Velodromo Vigorelli alla scoperta dei segreti di questa pista considerata magica per quasi un secolo. Sarà un modo per percorrere i novanta anni di storia: dalla prima gara, alla rinascita dopo la distruzione dei bombardamenti del ‘44, ai concerti dei Beatles (due esibizioni nello stesso giorno, il 24 giugno 1965, ndr), al periodo d’oro durato sino al 1985, ai recenti progetti di rilancio\"..\nL'INIZIATIVA\n—Scalmana si riferisce soprattutto alla storia del SC Genova 1913 ASD, quando era una polisportiva e la gloria se l’era appuntata sul petto anche grazie al nuoto, all’atletica e al pugilato. Attraverso più di un secolo, la maglia arancio e blu l’hanno indossata almeno in venticinquemila, un gruppone da cui spuntano i nomi illustri di Alfredo Binda, il più famoso, o di un altro Alfredo, Sivocci, tricolore fra i dilettanti e vincitore di alcune tappe al Giro (la prima nel 1911, l’ultima nel 1924). Racconti epici tramandati di generazione in generazione nella sede storica del club in Via Marostica 4.\nLa settima edizione della Gran Milan porterà gli iscritti a spasso per la Brianza. Avrà il percorso classico su strada da 200 Km (2200 m di dislivello) e 130 Km (con 1100 m), con omologazione per i brevetti ARI AUDAX, valido per il campionato regione Lombardia FCI. Due percorsi gravel da 130 (1100) e 90 Km (650 m), che attraversano le campagne della Brianza comasca fino ad arrivare, nel percorso lungo, al confine con la Svizzera, con omologazione per i brevetti ARI AUDAX, valido per il campionato regione Lombardia FCI. E, altra novità, 2 percorsi light da 70 km strada e 50 km gravel, meno impegnativi, aperti ad amatori in possesso di semplice certificato medico non agonistico senza obbligo di iscrizione a società sportive. Sarà possibile utilizzare anche una e-bike.
