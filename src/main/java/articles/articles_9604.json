    "text": "Change Healthcare confirmed it paid hefty ransom to the threat actors behind the recent cyber attack, but even this was not enough to protect patient data.\nOn Feb. 21, Change Healthcare disclosed that it fell victim to a ransomware attack, which caused massive disruptions to company's healthcare payment management platform. The Alphv/BlackCat gang, a prolific ransomware-as-a-service operation, quickly claimed responsibility for an attack.\nAlphv/BlackCat eventually made a presumed exit scam in early March, making off with a $22 million ransomware payment that researchers connected to Change Healthcare. However, UnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare, did not confirm it paid a ransom until the company issued statements to news outlets this week. Wired first reported the $22 million figure last month .\nBut despite Change Healthcare's payment to the Alphv/BlackCat gang, a second ransomware gang known as RansomHub claimed it obtained Change Healthcare data this month. RansomHub, which began leaking the data , claimed to have extremely sensitive information from Change Healthcare customers including patient medical records and personally identifiable information.\nOn this episode of the Risk & Repeat podcast, TechTarget Editorial editors Rob Wright and Alex Culafi discuss the ransomware attack against Change Healthcare and the value, or lack thereof, that often comes with paying the ransom.\nSubscribe to Risk & Repeat on Apple Podcasts .\nAlexander Culafi is a senior information security news writer and podcast host for TechTarget Editorial.

    "text": "OTTAWA — Mark Carney would be an \"outstanding addition\" to federal politics, the prime minister said Thursday, in response to speculation that he is trying to recruit the former Bank of Canada governor to join his cabinet. Trudeau was asked about the possibility of replacing Chrystia Freeland by making Carney his new finance minister during a press conference at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. Rather than deny the possibility, Trudeau praised Carney and said he's been talking to him about joining federal politics for years. \"I think he would be an outstanding addition at a time when Canadians need good people to step up in politics,\" Trudeau said. But he also emphasized that he has full confidence in Freeland. \"In regards to Chrystia, she has been a close friend and ally and partner in doing really big things for Canada and will continue to be,\" he said. In French, Trudeau said he was \"always open\" to having other people join the party. A source in the Prime Minister's Office, who spoke under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the suggestion that Trudeau is thinking about replacing Freeland with Carney is \"totally false.\" The idea of Carney running for the Liberals has been a constant discussion in Canadian political circles for years, and he himself has not ruled out the possibility of one day seeking the Liberal leadership. Speculation about a role for Carney, either in the Liberal cabinet or at the helm of it, has run rampant since the Liberals lost a long-held seat in a Toronto byelection last month. Most thought the seat would be a safe one for the Liberals, and the loss sparked calls for Trudeau's resignation from within and outside the party. Despite the criticism, Trudeau has pledged to lead the Liberals into the next election. Carney's supporters see him as a strong economic candidate, as the Liberals struggle to address the growing expense of basic needs in Canada and defend against criticism about government spending. Conservatives have already taken aim at Carney, and even called for him to appear at a parliamentary committee in April so they could grill him about his plans for government economic and fiscal policy. This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 11, 2024. Laura Osman, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Exitosa lucha antidrogas Luchar contra el tráfico ilícito de drogas, tanto para impedir su ingreso al país como para bloquear su consumo dentro del mercado, es una de las tareas más difíciles y retadoras para cualquier gobierno. Por más mecanismos tecnológicos, agentes especializados, unidades aéreas y marítimas y cooperación internacional, la batalla a los narcos y sus sicarios siempre resulta interminable. En algunos operativos de persecución, intercepción o incautación de drogas, median verdaderas escaramuzas al estilo guerra de guerrillas, lo que las convierte en acciones muy arriesgadas. La lucha se hace más esforzada cuando implica utilizar los sistemas de inteligencia para detectar o dar seguimiento a los narcotraficantes, porque estos operan bajo la sombrilla de los “carteles”, muy poderosos por cierto. Y si a este cuadro de complejidades de una guerra le añadimos el del perverso y antipatriótico contubernio de autoridades civiles y militares con los jefes del crimen organizado, para facilitar el tráfico, consumo y las secuelas de la “guerra sucia”, ahí podrá apreciarse el tremendo costo de esta lucha. Por eso resulta justo el reconocimiento que ha hecho el gobierno de Estados Unidos al de República Dominicana por la incautación de 23,000 toneladas métricas de narcóticos ilícitos este año. Así ha sido el promedio cuantitativo de la Dirección Nacional de Control de Drogas (DNCD), desde el 2020, bajo la dirección del vicealmirante José Cabrera Ulloa, coronando su desempeño con el mayor decomiso de 1,400 kilos de cocaína penetrados por las costas de Baní el pasado viernes. El costo en hombre-hora, riesgos de muerte, movilización de equipos, vigilancia continua y blindaje para evitar el contraespionaje interno y neutralizar a los que soplan datos confidenciales, representa una de las grandes inversiones prioritarias del país. Más que medir los éxitos de la DNCD por el monto de las incautaciones, el relieve de esta lucha radica en reducir la oferta de estas drogas ilícitas en el mercado, en el supremo esfuerzo de alejar a los niños, adolescentes y jóvenes de estas fatales adicciones. Es una lucha que no tiene fin. Es deber de la sociedad rendir homenaje a los hombres y mujeres de la DNCD y de las fuerzas armadas que velan por la salud social del país. Buen momento para que, en un gesto singular e histórico, el Poder Ejecutivo condecore la bandera de la DNCD con la Orden de Duarte, Sánchez y Mella, en el grado de Orden al Mérito Militar, por esta cadena de triunfos en la lucha antidrogas.",

    "text": "Jesús Salas Documents Legacy of State’s Farmworkers\nA new memoir by Latino leader who helped organize farmworkers movement in Wisconsin.\nIn 1966,\nJesús Salas led the historic march of migrant farmworkers from Wautoma to Madison, in the process helping organize Wisconsin’s first farmworker union.\nHe went on to become a leader in Latinx community organizations throughout Milwaukee and Wisconsin.\n[His memoir, “] Obreros Unidos: The Roots and Legacy of the Farmworkers Movement,” was published in June by the Wisconsin Historical Society Press.\nSalas’s story details how the work of the farmworkers movement created a lasting impact on the Latinx community in Milwaukee and the rest of Wisconsin.\nA young life in the fields\nSalas came from a family of migrant workers and spent most of his childhood working in fields across the nation.\n“It was a family-based working system when we were migrant workers because wages were so low you depended on a family income,” Salas said. “But in my family, we still had to go to school whether our clothes were stained from sugar beets, or we smelled like onions, it was a part of our life.”\nAfter spending years as migrant farmers, Salas’ family settled in Wautoma, Wisconsin, in 1959.\n“So, I went back to the labor camps after a few years of being away and I got a different picture of what conditions of the migrant workers were,” he said. “Parents we were trying to recruit for the day care would come me with problems about housing conditions, how they weren’t getting paid, lack of sewer systems, people getting hurt and not knowing what to do, etc.”\nAfter three years, Salas got word of\nCesar Chavez marching in California and called him to form a relationship and learn about the labor organizing being done there. That’s how he began organizing.\nThe organizing begins\n“So, we went on strike and petitioned the Wisconsin employment relations commission to recognize us as a union,” Salas said.\nAccording to Salas, it was a rocky start because they lost the first strike. But after going back to the drawing board and learning a bit more, they organized a walkout and then they began to see progress.\n“It was a tremendous victory because people were doubting us and feeling like we weren’t representing the workers,” Salas said. “But after that victory, it was a resounding message to the whole industry that workers were interested in joining our union.”\nSalas landed in Milwaukee in 1968 after participating in the grape boycott to support California farmworkers organizing for a union. Boycott efforts were concentrated in the big cities and displaced migrant workers were going to cities in search of jobs.\nWhat he saw in Milwaukee pushed the fight even further.\nThe battle for rights broadens\n“The big battles were access to education and the Latinization of service agencies,” he said. “Because at that time, we had all of the service agencies being born. But the problem was Latinos couldn’t access them because we didn’t have a college education.”\nSalas, with other young leaders, fought for space for Latinos on University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s campus and bilingual opportunities in\nMilwaukee Public Schools. James Groppi and the NAACP Youth Council.\n“I was getting settled in on the 500 block of West National to organize a grape boycott,” Salas said. “Several blocks down the street, here comes Father Groppi from the North Side marching with the NAACP Youth Council protesting employment discrimination against Allen-Bradley.”\nAfter meeting them, Salas said the two groups began supporting one another by getting involved in one another’s marches and addressing issues that affected both communities as a unit.\nThe work of Obreros Unidos led to changes in the law surrounding migrant workers, housing conditions and the wages system, as well as opportunities outside of farm work.\nSalas became the first Latino CEO of United Migrant Opportunity Services. He also taught courses at MATC and UW-Madison.\nNNS Spotlight: How Jesús Salas documents the legacy of Wisconsin farmworkers – and his own was originally published by Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service\nIf you think stories like this are important, become a member of Urban Milwaukee and help support real, independent journalism.

Estos días en los que media España está de vacaciones, afrontamos un importante cambio de ciclo que nos afectará de lleno en unos días en los que parecerá que estamos ante una situación que acabará traduciéndose en un mal mayor. Habrá llegado el momento de empezar a pensar en lo que está pasando a nuestro alrededor, en estas jornadas en las que tenemos mucho por hacer al aire libre. Los planes que tengamos en estos días pueden verse afectados por una situación que realmente nos perjudicará o nos obligará a adaptarnos. Pasamos a una ola de calor intensa a un marcado descenso de las temperaturas que sin duda alguna acabará convirtiéndose en lo que necesitamos. Es el momento de ver un poco más allá y de hacerlo de tal manera que hay mucho por ver y sentir. Toma nota de lo que nos está esperando, siguiendo la previsión del tiempo de uno de los grandes expertos, [Mario Picazo](https://okdiario.com/sociedad/aviso-urgente-mario-picazo-lo-que-va-vivir-espana-extiende-hasta-15-13193821). Prepárate para vivir unos días de cambios de lo más intensos. No está preparada España para lo que llega Por mucho que queramos empezar a prepararnos para estos días que tenemos por delante, será mejor que no hagamos planes a largo plazo. Estamos viviendo uno de los veranos más extraños de los últimos tiempos, afrontamos una situación que puede llegar a ser la que nos marque de cerca. De las olas de calor, que han sido un total de tres en lo que llevamos de verano, hemos pasado a una situación de inestabilidad. Varias DANAS han sido las protagonistas de estas jornadas en las que afrontamos unos cambios destacados. Sin duda alguna, tocará ver un poco más allá de este día de la mano de un experto que puede acabar siendo el que marque una diferencia importante. Es hora de establecer una serie de cambios que irán llegando y que seguramente tenemos que afrontar de una manera o de otra. Lo que llega es una situación de inestabilidad que acabará siendo un auténtico choque térmico que se acerca a toda velocidad. Tendrás que estar preparado para ver llegar este cambio de rumbo que podría acabar marcando este antes y después que tenemos por delante. Esta [previsión del tiempo](https://okdiario.com/noticias/prevision-del-tiempo/) puede cambiar los planes que tienes por delante. Mario Picazo alerta del choque térmico que se acerca Será mejor que preparemos el paraguas para este fin de semana, se acerca un importante alivio térmico que puede acabar siendo el que marque una diferencia respecto a estos días. El experto en el tiempo, Mario Picazo no tiene ninguna duda de lo que nos está esperando. Los mapas del tiempo nos preparan para una situación para la que quizás no estamos preparados: La ola de calor tiene las horas contadas: «Breve alivio térmico a la vista. Este fin de semana la entrada de aire más frío por el norte de la península ayudará a aliviar el intenso calor que hemos estado viviendo esta semana como consecuencia de la tercera ola de calor. No sólo puede refrescar algo, en las comunidades del norte veremos más nubosidad y precipitaciones que en zonas del nordeste podrán ser algo más intensas y persistentes e incluso ser tormentosas». Siguiendo con la misma previsión: «Los húmedos vientos del norte y algo de aire frío en capas más altas de la atmósfera ayudará a que las nubes sean abundantes en muchas zonas del norte peninsular. Aunque las precipitaciones van a ser en general débiles y aisladas en el nordeste, sí se espera que el viernes, sobre todo, y parte del fin de semana puedan ser más persistentes. También podrán producirse tormentas que, localmente, serán intensas desde los Pirineos hasta el Sistema Central y el Ibérico. En el resto de España predominará el ambiente soleado sin descartar la presencia de nubes bajas en algunas zonas costeras del Mediterráneo y en el norte de las islas Canarias donde los alisios van a seguir soplando con rachas moderadas a fuertes». Esta masa de aire ayudará a hacer pasar un verano que puede acabar siendo el que marque la diferencia: «Con la entrada de una masa de aire más fresca por el norte estos días recortaremos algunos grados a muchos termómetros tanto de día como de noche. Aún así vamos a seguir viendo valores cercanos a los 40ºC en el sur y en zonas del centro. En el norte los valores de las temperaturas serán hasta 20ºC más bajos con respecto a los del Valle del Guadalquivir y del Ebro o incluso la Región de Murcia. Las noches van a seguir siendo bochornosas en muchas zonas con valores mínimos de entre 20ºC y 25ºC, especialmente a orillas del Mediterráneo donde el factor humedad hará que el calor sea más difícil de llevar».",
