    "title": "Major winter storm poised to deliver this winter's most significant blow yet | CNN",
    "text": "CNN — A major winter storm will deliver heavy snow, hazardous ice, rain and severe thunderstorms to more than 1,300 miles of the United States over the weekend and into next week.\nSnow and ice so far this winter in the eastern two-thirds of the country have been limited to northern states. But this storm will break that mold and bring treacherous conditions to millions from the Plains to the East Coast, including in areas less prone to winter weather.\nAnd where it’s too warm for snow and ice, the storm could conjure up severe thunderstorms, including in some of the same areas still recovering from December’s deadly storms .\nMajor impacts, including “considerable disruptions to daily life … dangerous or impossible driving conditions and widespread closures,” are expected from this storm through Sunday in parts of the Central US, according to the Winter Storm Severity Index.\nIt all starts on Saturday afternoon when the storm develops in the Plains, fueled by a deep surge of moist air moving north out of the Gulf of Mexico. It will start to spread snow, rain and an icy mix over the Plains late in the day as it strengthens and expands.\nFrom there it will track east and spread a wintry mess into the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Midwest by Sunday morning. The storm will expand into the Ohio Valley and Southeast Sunday and to the East Coast Sunday night and Monday.\nThe regions at greatest risk are clear, but exactly who gets snow, ice or mainly rain — and how much — is still incredibly difficult to determine. Small shifts in the storm’s track could change the outcomes entirely. Some areas could start as snow but change over to an icy mix as warmer air enters the area, while other spots start as rain or an icy mix and gradually change over to snow.\nThis storm will be capable of unleashing more than a foot of snow and enough ice to knock out power just as the coldest temperatures of the season arrive in its wake.\nSnow will bury some areas The storm will lay down several inches of snow from late Saturday through Monday in a stripe that stretches from parts of Kansas and Nebraska to the East Coast.\nThe highest snow totals will rack up in the coldest areas, likely in parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. Totals will be lower in areas where warmer air generates sleet and ice instead of snow.\nSt. Louis has only seen four days where more than a foot of snow fell in 24 hours — a feat that could happen Sunday. Snow totals could range from an inch to more than a foot in parts of Missouri, depending on the storm’s exact track. This could also be the case for the other states with the greatest chances of snow.\nUnlike during other storms this winter, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Upstate New York could receive little-to-no snow because of the storm’s more southerly track. Some lake-effect snow is possible in Michigan and New York as the wind direction shifts both before and after the storm.\nTreacherous ice to come The greatest risk of dangerous ice will set up just south of the snowiest areas. Significant icing is possible from Kansas and Missouri through the central Appalachians and potentially parts of Maryland and Delaware.\nTravel could be “nearly impossible” in the areas of heaviest icing, multiple National Weather Service offices warned.\nIce amounts of 0.25 inches or more are possible, especially in parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana and almost all of Kentucky.\nAny amount of ice is dangerous; just a thin layer – a light glaze to just over 0.10 inches – can turn paved surfaces into skating rinks, causing people to slip and vehicles to slide out of control.\nA car slides around a corner amid snow in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday. Scenes like this will be playing out across the eastern two-thirds of the US once a major winter storm hits over the weekend. Cody Scanlan/The Register/USA Today Network/Imagn Images The thicker the ice, the worse its impact. Heavy ice – 0.25 inches or more – weighs down trees and power lines and can snap branches or pull down electrical wires. Large amounts of ice could also completely immobilize travel by making roads impassable.\nAn ice storm that slammed the Central US in January of last year knocked out power to thousands and sent first responders spinning out of control as they tried to reach people in distress.\nPower outages could be widespread and long-lasting if significant icing occurs and power restoration crews can’t navigate treacherous roads. That situation could be dangerous or potentially deadly for those without access to heat in the extreme cold to come.\nDamaging thunderstorms and soaking rain The southern, warmer side of the storm will spread rain and some embedded thunderstorms over much of the South. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe, especially on Sunday afternoon.\nA level 2 of 5 threat of severe thunderstorms is in place Sunday for parts of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\nDamaging wind gusts and hail are the most likely threats from any severe thunderstorm but tornadoes are also possible. A tornado outbreak , including multiple rated EF3s, rocked parts of the South in late December.\nDamage in the aftermath of severe thunderstorms in Porter Heights, Texas, on December 28, 2024. The Woodlands Fire Department Rain and storms could also cause flooding, especially where the heaviest rain falls in the Southeast.\nThe massive storm will finally exit the East Coast late Monday and fully diminish in impact overnight.\nBut Tuesday presents a new problem: Arctic cold. Temperatures will plunge as much as 30 degrees below normal for the eastern two-thirds of the US and the frigid air will last for some into at least the middle of January, locking in whatever snow and ice fall from the storm.",

    "text": "UTC Women Suffer a Tough 57-54 Loss to Wofford\n(gomocs.com) SPARTANBURG, S.C. — Chattanooga women’s basketball lost a heartbreaker on Thursday night in Spartanburg, with the Mocs coming up just short in a 57-54 defeat to first-place Wofford at the Jerry Richardson Indoor Stadium.\nThe Mocs (9-10, 4-2 SoCon) had their sights set on grabbing a share of first place in the SoCon with a victory over the league-leading Terriers (14-5, 6-0 SoCon), but shooting woes from three-point range proved the difference as UTC came up just short in the end.\n“I think that this is a game that we’re going to reference later on and really look back on as an important game for us in this season, specifically on our hunt for a conference championship,” head coach Deandra Schirmer said. “And I feel like obviously it wasn’t the result that we wanted, but if we can lock in and we can learn from our mistakes and understand that coming into this game, we’re seeing Wofford blowing out teams left, right and center, and for me, it just verifies what we are, what we thought we are.\n“We’re going to be a top team in this conference. So now, let’s keep the fire that’s in our stomachs and however mad I am right now about the loss, I’m channeling that into these next couple games because we have everything we need.”\nUTC’s defense came out of the gate ready for the challenge, as the Mocs locked down an otherwise threatening Wofford offense right from the opening tip.\nSigrun Olafsdottir broke through first in the game, connecting on a three to give the Mocs a 3-0 lead early-on in the night. As the teams tangled back and forth over the remainder of the first quarter, a Gianna Corbitt offensive rebound and putback helped put Chattanooga ahead 13-12 right before the frame came to its end.\nThe Mocs and Terriers continued to exchange blows through the second as neither team gave an inch to the other. While Wofford was able to build up a 30-24 advantage with 2:22 left to play in the half, that lead quickly evaporated following three-pointers on back-to-back possessions for UTC.\nSome late free throws falling for Caia Elisaldez pushed the Mocs in front right before the teams made their way to the locker rooms. Leading 34-32, the Mocs were looking to play spoiler to the Terriers’ undefeated SoCon season.\nThe second half proved to be just as much of a knockdown, drag out fight between the two squads.\nMuch like the previous two quarters, the third quarter saw the two sides trading leads over nearly the entire 10 minutes of action. And once again, just like the first and second quarters, a late score by UTC gave the Mocs a lead heading into the quarter break as Elisaldez converted from the charity stripe to give Chattanooga a narrow 42-41 lead heading into the fourth.\nThe Mocs continued to exchange leads with the Terriers before an 8-0 scoring run by Wofford suddenly saw UTC trailing 54-48 with 3:35 left in the game. Remaining calm, the Mocs found ways to score to keep their hopes of victory alive.\nA late and-one conversion from Ava Card followed by another basket by the freshman put the Mocs into striking position as Wofford now only held a 55-54 lead with 1:01 remaining on the clock. A clutch basket by Wofford would push the Terrier lead back up to three with 0:31 left to play.\nThe Mocs then had their share of opportunities to tie the game, as offensive rebounds, jump balls and missed free throws by Wofford ended up giving UTC four different chances to tie the game from three-point range. Those hail mary shots wouldn’t find the bottom of the net, however, as time ran out on Chattanooga’s hopes of coming back with the Terriers taking a 57-54 win when all was said and done.\nCaia Elisaldez tied her career-high of 21 points in the loss, leading the way for the Mocs in the scoring department while also logging a team-high four assists. Sigrun Olafsdottir also added 12 points for UTC paired with a team-leading four steals.\nGianna Corbitt saw her double-double streak snapped, but only just barely as the freshman ended her night with nine points alongside a team-high eight boards. Corbitt also added three steals and a block on the defensive side of the ball for the Mocs. Brooke Anya rounded out Chattanooga’s stat leaders, finishing with a team-high two blocks.",

    "title": "Hollywood legend, 90, 'returning to screens' for new Netflix series after retirement",
    "text": "Hollywood icon Sir Michael Caine is reportedly coming out of retirement to take part in a new Netflix series.\nThe A Bridge Too Far actor, 90, devastated fans when he announced his retirement from acting in October. The British legend has been in more than 160 films over a career spanning seven decades. At the time, Sir Michael told the BBC : \"You don't have leading men at 90.\"\n\"I keep saying I’m going to retire. Well, I am now. I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and had incredible reviews… What am I going to do that will beat this?\" And now, a few months after his announcement, it has been revealed he was asked to take part in one final series.\nThe Oscar, Golden Globe and Bafta-winning actor has an extensive and diverse filmography, including classic films ranging from Zulu and The Italian Job to more recently in Interstellar and The Dark Knight franchise, alongside Christian Bale. His final film was The Great Escaper with the late Glenda Jackson.\nSpeaking about the upcoming series, an insider claimed to The Sun : \"He’s been asked to star in a Netflix series. Details are kept closely guarded.\" Filming reportedly starts next month. The Mirror have contacted his reps for comment.\nSir Michael's final film, The Great Escaper was released on October 6 and has him playing real-life World War Two veteran Bernie Jordan who escaped from a care home to attend D-Day celebrations in France. Sir Michael had turned the film down three times before accepting the role as he considered himself retired.\nHe stars alongside Glenda, who died in June after the completion of the film. Announcing his retirement, he also told BBC Radio 4's Today show: \"The only parts I’m liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85. They’re not going to be the lead. You don’t have leading men at 90, you’re going to have young handsome boys and girls. So I thought, I might as well leave with all this.”\nHis announcement comes a month before Sir Michael’s novel Deadly Game is scheduled for release. The novel follows the adventures of DCI Harry Taylor, a detective with no respect for red tape or political reputations.\nSir Michael said in June: “It’s been my ambition for years to write a thriller. It’s the genre I most love to read and I’ve really got a buzz out of working on Deadly Game and teaming up with Hodder once again to publish it. I hope readers enjoy getting to know Harry Taylor as much as I did.”\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

    "text": "The Assam cabinet on Friday decided to repeal an 89-year-old legislation involving the registration of marriages and divorces by Muslims residing in the state.“Our chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had already announced that Assam would be implementing a uniform civil code. Today we have taken a very important decision in that journey by deciding to repeal the Assam Moslem Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935,” informed tourism minister Jayanta Malla Baruah.ALSO READ- UCC bill: Understanding the provisions and legal contextThe Act provided for voluntary registration of Muslim marriages and divorces and allowed the government to provide a licence to a Muslim person authorizing him to register Muslim marriages and divorces on applications for such registration.“Today’s development means that it won’t be possible to register Muslim marriages and divorces under this legislation any more in Assam. We already have a Special Marriage Act, and we want all marriages to be registered under provisions of that,” Baruah stated.He informed that Assam has at present 94 authorized persons who could register Muslim marriages and divorces. But with the cabinet decision, their authority would cease to exist after the issuance of directions for the same by district authorities.“Since these persons were earning a livelihood by registering marriages and divorces, the state cabinet has decided to provide them with a one-time compensation of ₹2 lakhs each,” said Baruah.He said that apart from moving a step closer towards a uniform civil code, the cabinet felt it was necessary to repeal the Act, which was old and was in operation since British days and didn’t match with today’s societal norms.“We had noticed that this present legislation was being used to register marriages of boys and girls under the permissible age. We think that today’s move will be a big step in curbing such child marriages,” the minister said.ALSO READ- Jolt for Assam Congress as two MLAs extend support to Sarma-led governmentOn February 12, CM Sarma stated that his government is planning to bring robust legislation banning polygamy and implementing of uniform civil code (UCC) in the state.“We were following (legislation to ban) polygamy, but Uttarakhand has passed the UCC (Bill). We are now working on aligning both (issues) so that we can prepare robust legislation. We are working on that,” Sarma had said.ALSO READ- More than 1.59 lakh declared as 'foreigners' in Assam: Himanta Biswa SarmaHe had mentioned that an expert committee would see how to align both polygamy and UCC in the same legislation.The government had planned to table a Bill banning polygamy in the ongoing budget session of the assembly, but it hasn’t happened yet.",

Dichos guiones deberán ser inéditos y su trama deberá transcurrir en una de las localizaciones e incluir los hitos propuestos por el Certamen. Un comité especializado valorará y seleccionará, de entre los proyectos recibidos, diez guiones que pasarán a la fase de rodaje. Los cortometrajes montados y terminados se deberán presentar el 19 de noviembre, y se proyectarán al público entre el 22 y el 30 de noviembre entre distintas salas de los municipios participantes. En una segunda fase, el jurado fallará los premios sobre esos diez cortometrajes, para los que la organización establece cinco galardones: un primer premio de 2.500 euros; un segundo de 1.000; un tercero, a la mejor fotografía, de 500 euros; un premio del público de 500 euros; un premio especial del jurado, de otros 500 euros; y, a la mejor interpretación, con 250 euros. Los ganadores se darán a conocer en el transcurso de una gala de entrega de premios que en esta edición tendrá lugar en Tafalla en el mes de diciembre.

I Incubadora Navarra, Tierra de CineEntre las novedades de esta edición se encuentra el lanzamiento de la I Incubadora Navarra, Tierra de Cine que tendrá lugar en Arguedas los días 29 y 30 de agosto. Se trata de un encuentro presencial inmersivo dirigido a los 10 equipos finalistas del certamen de cortometrajes Navarra, Tierra de Cine con mentorías y tutorías orientadas a que les ayuden en la preparación de sus rodajes, promueva el diálogo y el intercambio entre los proyectos participantes, y sirva de toma de contacto con las localidades de rodaje.

Asimismo los equipos finalistas contarán con sesiones personalizadas de asesoramiento técnico profesional de guion a cargo del Sindicato de guionistas de España ALMA, con propuestas de mejoras técnicas y estructurales en los proyectos antes de la fase de rodaje.

    "title": "Law limiting new oil wells in California set to take effect after industry withdraws referendum",
    "text": "By Adam Beam ,\n26 minutes ago\nA California law that bans drilling new oil wells near places like homes and schools will take effect soon after the oil industry said it would withdraw a referendum from the November ballot asking voters to block it.\nThe law, first passed in 2022, never took effect because the California Independent Petroleum Association gathered enough signatures for the referendum.\nThe association announced Wednesday it would withdraw the referendum. Instead it plans to file a lawsuit asking a judge to block the law.\nThe announcement shakes up what has been a crowded November ballot. Both sides had been gearing up for what would have been an expensive campaign.\nCalifornia was the nation's leading oil producing state over a century ago, but it has since been surpassed by Texas, New Mexico , North Dakota, Colorado , Alaska and Oklahoma.\nThe oil industry has still remained a powerful force in state politics, known for having its way at the state Legislature. But that influence has been declining, along with the state's oil production.\nThe 2022 law bans drilling new wells within 3,200 feet (975 meters) of “sensitive receptors,” defined as homes, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, retirement homes, prisons and any business that is open to the public.\nIn asking voters to block the law, the oil industry's strategy was to portray it as an “energy shutdown.” The argument was that it would only increase the state's dependence on foreign oil and contribute to California's high gas prices, which remain among the highest in the country.\nSupporters of the law countered by saying oil wells spew harmful pollution that increases the risk of ailments like asthma and cancer.\nThe California Independent Petroleum Association disputed those claims. But it decided that “supporters of the energy shutdown can make unfounded claims in the press and in paid advertisements, but they can't make those claims in court without evidence,” said Jonathan Gregory, the association's president and CEO of oil and gas company RMX Resources.\n“That's why we are pivoting from the referendum to a legal strategy,” Gregory said.\nSupporters of the law took the news as an admission of defeat from the oil industry. In March they launched a statewide campaign to support keeping the law, with backing from the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jane Fonda and Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n“Big oil saw what they were up against — and they folded, again,” Newsom said in a statement. “No parent in their right mind would vote to allow drilling next to daycares and playgrounds.”\nThe Legislature had been applying pressure to the oil industry, too. Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Democrat from Los Angeles whose district includes the largest urban oil field in the United States, introduced a bill that would have fined companies $10,000 per day from operating wells near homes and schools that produce less than 15 barrels per day.\nBryan, in an interview, said he agreed to limit the scope of that bill to just the oil field in his district, known as the Inglewood Oil Field.\n“That was the gift from me to them in exchange for them agreeing to pull back this measure,” Bryan said.\nState Sen. Lena Gonzalez, a Democrat from Long Beach who authored the ban on new oil wells, said the law finally taking effect will mean cleaner air for her community, which includes her three sons.\n“I never thought this would actually happen because of the power and influence sometimes in this building,” she said, speaking in the Capitol. “This time, oil didn’t win, and this time our community won.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
