    "text": "HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets Review 2024: Ragz’s Trial Results & Experience\nBy <a href=\"https://www.hepper.com/author/sara-seitz/\">\nSara Seitz </a>\nUpdated on\nClick to Skip Ahead\nWe give HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets a rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars\nStarting your pet on CBD oil is a slippery slope. These products can be incredibly effective for treating a wide variety of health and behavioral issues. But they can also be very costly, especially considering that you have to use them daily to see results.\nIf the cost of quality CBD has you hesitating, you might be interested in learning more about HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets. This USDA organic CBD oil contains a respectable 10mg of CBD per milliliter and costs a fraction of what other effective oils do.\nBut does it work as well? That’s what I set out to discover when I tested this CBD product on my thirteen-year-old Dalmatian mix, Ragz. Find out if this bargain organic oil is worth it in my HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets review, below.\nOverview\nProduct Type: | CBD oil |\nBest Suited For: | Pets with anxiety, joint pain, sleep problems, and more |\nPrice Range: | Highly affordable |\nIngredients: | Organic hemp seed oil, chicken flavoring, organic full-spectrum hemp cannabidiol oil, bacon flavoring |\nConcentration: | 300mg CBD per bottle (10mg CBD per ml) |\nOptions: | Chicken flavor – 30ml |\nSpectrum: | Full-spectrum |\nStorage: | Refrigerate after opening |\nRecommended Dose: | 5-15 lbs: ½-1 dropper; 15-75 lbs: 1-2 droppers; over 75 lbs: 2-3 droppers |\nOur Experience\nMy old lady dog, Ragz, has tested a variety of CBD products, from the pricey to the affordable. Within the latter end of that spectrum, we have found a few products that were surprisingly effective for how low-priced they were. But we have rarely encountered USDA organic products at this price point.\nThis is one of many reasons that HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets intrigued me. This CBD oil has all the markings of an effective, high-quality oil: it’s organic, full-spectrum, made from American-grown hemp, and comes in a relatively high concentration. But it’s priced well below what I would expect.\nThis had me wondering how well it would work. Ragz, who has long relied on CBD oil to relieve her joint pain, was up for the task of finding this out.\nAfter dosing her meals twice a day for the last three weeks, I can tell you that this CBD oil definitely works.\nAfter about a week and a half on this new product, I could see a clear difference in Ragz’s pain levels. She seemed to be in far less pain on walks and was visibly less stiff when she got up from naps.\nThere was definitely a lot to like about this product as well as a few downsides.\nI love that this product is USDA-certified organic. It’s also GMP-certified, made from Colorado hemp, and third-party lab-tested.\nThis is a full-spectrum product which means it contains CBD along with other cannabinoids, including CBDV, CBG, CBC, and THC. These other trace elements help enhance the effects CBD has on the body.\nWhile high levels of THC can be dangerous for dogs and other pets, this product has less than 0.3%, which is considered safe for pets. In fact, the lab tests consistently put THC levels for HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets below 0.05%.\nRagz and I both liked how easy this was to add to her meals. While the added flavors didn’t make it palatable enough for her to gobble up straight, she had no problem licking it up along with her normal food.\nOf course, the price is a huge selling point for me, too. I typically pay up to twice this amount for organic pet CBD.\nDosing would have been quite a bit easier if HempLucid included measurement markers on their dropper. One ml or “one dose” is actually only ¾ of a dropper, which makes it hard to eyeball a half or quarter dose.\nWhile 10mg of CBD per milliliter is a good concentration since it makes dosing both large and small dogs fairly easy, I do wish HempLucid offered other concentration options.\nFor Ragz, I found this concentration to be a little low. I ended up upping her dose to one and a half droppers after a couple of weeks. This makes for a lot of added oil, so I would certainly buy the higher-concentration option if they had it.\nBut overall, Ragz and I were very happy with this product. You just can’t beat the price given the quality and effectiveness of this oil.\nPros & Cons\n- USDA-certified organic\n- Full-spectrum oil\n- Third-party lab tested\n- 10mg CBD per ml\n- Hemp seed carrier oil\n- Very affordable\n- Chicken flavored\n- No measurement markers\n- Only one concentration available\nKey Features\nEasy Dosing\nThis pet CBD oil has a moderately high concentration, which makes for easy dosing. Small dogs typically only need a ½ dropper to see the effects, while large dogs will do well with 2 to 3 droppers per dose.\nAnd since this oil contains both chicken and bacon flavoring, most dogs will eagerly lick it up along with their food or favorite treats. You can even squeeze the oil straight into their mouth.\nQuality Ingredients\nHempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets is made with USDA organic hemp seed oil and full-spectrum CBD oil.\nHemp seed oil is a great carrier oil for CBD because it’s naturally high in flavonoids and terpenes which help to increase CBD’s effectiveness. Full-spectrum CBD oil contains minor cannabinoids that also help to increase CBD’s effect on the body. The fact that both these oils are organic means you don’t have to worry about pesticides or other impurities.\nHighly Affordable\nThis pet CBD oil is easily one of the most affordable products I’ve found. In fact, it’s priced better than many of the non-organic options I recommend. If you have a dog with painful joints or chronic anxiety that requires daily CBD dosing, you will be hard-pressed to find a more affordable effective option than HempLucid.\nAbout HempLucid\nHempLucid has been creating quality human and pet CBD products from US-grown hemp since 2016.\nManufacturing: | All HempLucid CBD products are made in the USA |\nSourcing: | This company sources all of their hemp in Colorado |\nUSDA Organic: | HempLucid has maintained USDA Certification since 2020 |\nTesting: | All their products are third-party independent lab tested for purity and concentration |\nPredictability: | They use cloned hemp for unprecedented product predictability |\nIs HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets a Good Value?\nCompared to competitors, this product is incredibly well-priced. In fact, it is more affordable than many non-organic pet CBD oils, making it a great value. Best of all, if you sign up for HempLucid’s subscription program you can save an additional 5% on an already low-priced option.\nHow We Tested\nAs with all pet CBD products, I enlisted my pets to help test this oil.\nI dosed the oil according to the product dosing recommendations for the first two weeks. At this point, I adjusted the dose based on my observations and continued for an additional week. I started with a dose of 1 ml twice daily and increased it to 1.5 ml twice daily to achieve optimal results.\nI tested the oil by giving it straight to my dog, putting it on treats, and adding it to her food. She was not a big fan of taking the oil straight and it was a bit messy on treats. In the end, she received the vast majority of her doses in her meals and happily ate the oil this way.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nHow long will this product take to start working?\nIt typically takes 2 to 4 weeks of consistent use to see the full effect of CBD products. However, you are likely to see an acute effect within 45 minutes after the first dose.\nAre the added flavors organic?\nThe chicken and bacon flavorings are not listed as organic, however, the product is certified USDA organic.\nHow much THC is in this product?\nThis full-spectrum product contains less than 0.3% THC, which is the maximum recommended amount for pet products. According to the most recent lab results, the actual value is much less, sitting at around 0.05% THC.\nConclusion\nIf you’ve been on the hunt for an affordable, organic pet CBD oil that actually works, I highly recommend checking out HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets.\nNot only is this full-spectrum oil USDA-certified organic and highly effective, but it costs less than most non-organic CBD oils you’ll find. Better still, it is easy to dose, contains a relatively high concentration of CBD, and is flavored with chicken and bacon so your pup will happily lick it up.",

    "text": "La posture de Nasser Al-Khelaïfi sur la question du stade est figée. Le président du PSG l’a répété ce jeudi sur RMC dans Rothen s’enflamme, délocalisé au Campus PSG, le club parisien va quitter le Parc des Princes dans les prochaines années et construire un stade pouvant accueillir nettement plus de public que les 48.600 personnes de l’enceinte Porte Maillot. >> Les podcasts de Rothen s'enflamme \"J'aime beaucoup le Parc des Princes, tout le monde l'aime\", a déclaré le dirigeant qatari. \"Si j'écoute mon cœur, on ne part pas. Mais aujourd’hui, tout le monde en Europe a des stades de 100.000, 80.000, 90.000 places... On en a besoin, sinon on est morts. Est-ce une question de vie ou de mort? Oui. On est en France, mais on joue aussi en Europe. On dispute chaque année la Ligue des champions. Si on veut être au même niveau que les autres clubs, et sur le fair-play financier… On a besoin de notre stade. On n’a pas d’autres solutions.\" Et le dirigeant donne même une échéance relativement rapide: \"On a besoin d'un stade prêt dans 3-4 ans, on n'a pas de temps à perdre, sinon on est derrière d'autres clubs en Europe.\" Le PSG peut-il remplir un grand stade avec une politique sans stars? Dans l’After Foot sur RMC, Daniel Riolo a lui assuré que cette question de la pérennité du PSG n’était pas en jeu et que la réussite d’un grand stade n’était pas garantie pour le club parisien: \"Ce qu'il dit est évidemment faux, ce n'est pas une question de vie ou de mort (pour le PSG). S’ils ont planté les droits télé, c’est de leur faute à eux tous (les présidents des clubs français). Quand il dit vie ou de mort, en gros il lui faut de l’entrée d’argent par le ticketing (la billetterie) et par ce que peut apporter un grand stade. S’il s’est embrouillé avec la mairie de Paris, c’est lui. Il y avait un plan pour faire des travaux (au Parc des Princes), il existe encore. >> Les podcasts de l'After Foot Et surtout, surtout, surtout, il va se brouiller définitivement avec une base (de supporters du PSG). Quand tu te brouilles avec une base, pour aller reconstruire une autre base et viser 60 ou 70.000 personnes dans un stade, dans les matchs de Ligue des champions… Comment tu vas le remplir ton stade que tu vas aller construire à 20-30 bornes de Paris, où tu n’as pas encore le terrain, tu n’as pas encore les routes, tu n’as pas encore les transports pour y aller? Si tu ne changes pas de politique, puisque tu as dit désormais que tu veux une politique profil bas. En fait, il n’y a rien qui va dans ce qu’il dit.\" Une déclaration de Nasser Al-Khelaïfi qui pourrait ressembler à un moyen de pression envers la mairie de Paris, qui se refuse à vendre le Parc des Princes. Une démarche vaine, selon Daniel Riolo: \"En 2026 (année des prochaines élections municipales), politiquement les portes peuvent s’ouvrir. Donc ça ne sert à rien d’aller mettre un pressing de malade puisque a priori Anne Hidalgo va passer la main.\" Le nouveau stade du PSG sera-t-il déjà lancé à cette échéance?",

Partners Zach Pace and Rachelle Tomushev are behind the new project, which when open will feature an elevated wine shop with hundreds of wines, sakes and beer from around the world, along with a gourmet grocery focusing on small-batch producers and imported pantry staples sourced from Florida and across the Southeast. There also will be a 10- to 12-seat bar as well as a vinyl listening lounge featuring rare and classic vinyl and the occasional guest DJ. Volta marks the first commercial tenant announced for the development. Last month, Dynasty Financial Partners, a financial services firm, announced it will move its headquarters to 400 Central and will be the sole office tenant in the building. “We are excited to welcome Volta, an independent business founded by local residents, as our first announced commercial tenant,” John Catsimatidis, founder of the building’s developer Red Apple Group, said in a statement. “Their elevated wine and market offerings will be a staple of the building and a convenience for the residents of 400 Central and all of St. Petersburg.” Pace and Tomushev first spoke with the Tampa Bay Times about their plans for Volta in July 2024 and have been searching for the perfect downtown St. Pete space ever since. They toured the building at 400 Central Ave. in January, eventually locking in on a 2,000-square-foot space Pace described as being “mid-block” on the bottom floor, facing Central Avenue. Pace, who was the chief operating officer at the since-shuttered Ybor City restaurant Ten Rooms , has an extensive background in wine. He has worked as a wine importer and sommelier and also was the beverage director at two-Michelin-star restaurant Lazy Bear and the director of operations at Aphotic, another Michelin-starred restaurant, both in San Francisco. When Pace and Tomushev relocated to the Tampa Bay area (the couple live in St. Petersburg), they said they noticed a space in the downtown St. Pete market for wine retail and specialty foods. “The goal is to serve the needs of (the) downtown corridor but also the whole community,” Pace said. “We’re really meant to be everyday goods and approachable options.” Along with the extensive wine selection, patrons will be able to find things like baking supplies, Italian olive oils, tinned fish from Spain and Portugal, milled-to-order flour from the Carolinas, and local honey and cultured butter from Florida, among other amenities. In an emailed statement, Pace added: “Everything — from the wine and grocery selection to the space we’re building — is meant to feel welcoming, personal and human. We have politely turned down out-of-town investors, in lieu of inviting a small group of values-aligned locals to be a part of Volta. It’s about shared ownership of something independent and indelible for our thriving city. We want it to feel like the opposite of a chain — a place where people know your name, your taste in wine and maybe even your dog’s name.”Pace said he expects construction to wrap on the building in late 2025, after which his team will get to work on the interior buildout and design. He hopes to open Volta in spring 2026.",

    "text": "Era una víctima más del abandono. Luego de pasar varios días en la calle, finalmente llegó al refugio de animales Dogwood, en Misuri, Estados Unidos. Aunque mostraba bajo peso, Ginger tenía buen estado de salud en general . Corría el invierno de 2013. Calcularon que tendría unos dos años en ese momento y, luego su chequeo veterinario, la acomodaron en un recinto con alimento y agua a disposición y una cama donde pudiera descansar. Al ser una cachorra, seguramente no llevaría mucho encontrarle un hogar donde la cuidaran para siempre. Sin embargo, las experiencias de sus primeros años de vida habían dejado su huella. Ginger estaba ansiosa y tardaba en confiar, cualidades que, a los ojos de algunos, la convertían en un perro “inadoptable” . Entonces, en el refugio llegaron a la conclusión de que, hasta dar con la familia o persona que mostrara la paciencia y el amor que necesitaba, Ginger tendría que esperar.\nLO RESCATÓ EN TRIBUNALES, LO AYUDÓ A SANAR Y DIEZ MESES DESPUÉS LO DESPIDIÓ EN INDIA: “ME EMOCIONA RECORDARLO\"\n.",
