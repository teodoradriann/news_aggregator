    "text": "Ultra-Orthodox Rabbi urges followers to leave Zionist institutions\nIsraeli Rabbi Dov Landau directed Degel HaTorah representatives to withdraw from Zionist institutions, arguing that Zionism is a secular movement that contradicts traditional Jewish values.\nOn Tuesday, the Jerusalem Post reported that Rabbi Dov Landau, a senior figure in the Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox community in \"Israel,\" instructed representatives of the Degel HaTorah political party to withdraw from all Zionist institutions due to deep ideological differences with the secular foundations of Zionism.\nIn a letter published today in the ultra-Orthodox daily Yated Ne'eman, Landau wrote, \"Zionism is a movement whose purpose is to establish the Jewish people on an explicitly secular foundation, rooted in heresy and rebellion against divine sovereignty,\" adding, \"There is no allowance to participate with them, serve in any role within their institutions, or vote in their elections in any form whatsoever.\"\nHe emphasized that participating in these institutions supports beliefs that \"contradict traditional Jewish values, warning that it results in the desecration of God's name.\"\n'A change in Zionist dynamics'\nThe Jerusalem Post explains that Landau's statement comes amid wider discussions about the role of ultra-Orthodox and religious communities in Zionist institutions. It notes that the World Zionist Organization (WZO), established in 1897 by Theodor Herzl, oversees key institutions like the Jewish Agency for Israel, the Jewish National Fund (JNF), and Keren Hayesod.\nThe report notes a growing influence of religious, right-wing factions within these institutions in recent years. It highlights that in the 2020 elections for the 38th World Zionist Congress (WZC), Orthodox groups made significant gains, with the Eretz HaKodesh faction—a coalition of conservative religious-Zionist and ultra-Orthodox figures—securing over 20,000 votes.\nHowever, their platform notably refrained from using the terms \"Zionist\" or \"State of Israel,\" assuring potential voters that participating in WZO elections did not signify \"ideological support for Zionism.\"\nTheological divide\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that Landau’s opposition to Zionist institutions stems from long-standing ultra-Orthodox theology, which rejects Zionism as a \"secular-nationalist movement.\"\nIn his letter, he stated that Zionism is based on \"heresy and rebellion against divine sovereignty\", and participating in its institutions supports this ideology.\nRead next: The final stage is the end of Zionism: Haaretz\nHe clarified that while participation in Israeli elections is allowed to protect the religious character of the state, involvement in the Zionist Organization is incompatible with religious principles.\nImplications for Degel HaTorah\nAccording to the report, Degel HaTorah’s decision to withdraw from Zionist institutions could have practical consequences for its role within the United Torah Judaism (UTJ) faction in the Knesset.\nThe report also noted that Degel HaTorah's future participation in international Jewish forums, such as the World Zionist Congress (WZC), is uncertain following this directive.\nThe WZC, which convenes every five years, plays a significant role in directing billions of dollars in funding for Zionist initiatives globally.\nRead next: Boiling pot: 'Israel's' ideological discord",

    "title": "Kraken Fires Back At US SEC, Points To Legal Precedent | Bitcoin Insider",
    "text": "Latest news about Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Your daily crypto news habit. In a blow to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), [Kraken](https://bitcoinist.com/kraken-unveil-secret-europe-dutch-approval-unlocked/), the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, has fired back at the agency regarding its lawsuit against the platform, citing a crucial aspect of Ripple’s case. Kraken Responds to The US SEC Bill Morgan, a legal expert, [shared](https://x.com/Belisarius2020/status/1760873231530266977?s=20) the information concerning the lawsuit on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Friday. “It is interesting how Kraken summarises and references a significant portion of the Ripple case,” Morgan stated. Morgan highlighted that Kraken bases its stance on the claim that the [SEC](https://bitcoinist.com/sec-leader-resigns-stating-crypto-is-here-to-stay/) has not been able to develop a direct connection between the issuers of certain coins, which the commission calls “crypto asset securities.” According to the summary of the SEC v. Ripple document that Kraken cited, there is no relationship between the issuer and the buyer. Furthermore, it points out five reasons that demonstrate this lack of connection, with one of those grounds being that particular lack of expectation of income from Ripple’s effort, as noted by Judge Analisa Torres. Specifically, Kraken’s position refutes the SEC’s contention that assets like [Algorand (ALGO)](https://bitcoinist.com/algorand-algo-breakout-300/), [Cardano (ADA)](https://bitcoinist.com/analysts-unveil-reasons-behind-investors-switching-from-cardano-ada-to-pandoshi-pambo-in-2024/), and [Polygon (MATIC)](https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-matic-battles-with-bears-as-whales-swap-holdings-for-cheaper-more-bullish-rival-ahead-of-the-2024-bull-run/) that are sold on the crypto exchange and its customers are securities. Thus, Kraken, drawing a comparison to the Ripple case, argues that the 11 token issuers involved in the case, which the agency calls “crypto asset securities,” do not align with the typical requirement of an investment contract. The platform generally adopts a blind bid/ask trading mechanism akin to that of Ripple’s programmatic sales, which Judge Analisa Torres deemed were not investment contracts. A portion of those Ripple programmatic sales took place on the crypto exchange. So far, Morgan has emphasized how the ruling in the Ripple case might make it harder for the Commission to conclude the current legal dispute with Ripple. “Massive impediment to a settlement of the [SEC vs. Ripple case](https://bitcoinist.com/expert-shares-insight-on-ripple-vs-sec-case/),” he stated.”You can see the problem for the SEC if Judge Torres’ summary judgment decision stands and is not successfully appealed,” Morgan added. Crypto Exchange Files A Motion Of Dismissal A recent report from Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret [revealed](https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1760831634213863497?s=20) that Kraken has taken a pivotal step in the legal dispute by [filing](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/z8uzbnuiub6vxtmw) a motion of dismissal regarding the SEC’s claims. The exchange has asked the Northern California Court to dismiss the Commission’s assertion that it functions as an unregistered securities platform, dealer, broker, and clearing agency. Terret noted that a spokesperson from Kraken told Fox Business that the foundation of the SEC’s case relies on a “comprehensive new theory.” This would effectively “securitize” a variety of common commodities and assets. Furthermore, the spokesperson asserted that the regulatory watchdog currently considers any asset that “rises or falls in value” as an investment contract. Consequently, this action would allow the SEC to seize vast new power over the US economy, coinciding with [Congress](https://bitcoinist.com/us-congress-lift-major-bitcoin-adoption-barrier/) discussing how those powers should be distributed among government agencies.

    "text": "Caracas, Oct 20 (EFE).- The six Venezuelan opponents who took refuge in the residence of the Argentine embassy last March, after the Prosecutor’s Office accused them of conspiracy and other crimes, will meet this Sunday seven months locked up, without any signs of a change in their situation, at least in the short term.\nThe asylum seekers are Pedro Urruchurtu, Magalli Meda, Claudia Macero, Humberto Villalobos – all members of the Vente Venezuela (VV) party, led by María Corina Machado -, the former MP Omar González and Fernando Martínez Mottola, councilor of the main opposition coalition , Democratic United Platform (PUD).\nIn this regard, VV reiterated that these people “are persecuted because they exercise political rights and work for free elections”, alluding to the presidential elections of July 28, in which the National Electoral Council (CNE) proclaimed the controversial victory of Nicolás Maduro . not recognized by many countries.\nThrough the opposition.\nOn several occasions, anti-Chavismo has called for “an end to the persecution” against opponents who are in the Argentine diplomatic headquarters, especially after Venezuela revoked in September the authorization granted to Brazil to represent Argentina’s interests in Caracas .\nAfter the expulsion of the Argentine diplomatic representation by Maduro’s executive, following questions about the election result, Brazil agreed to garrison the southern country’s premises on Venezuelan territory, an agreement that Caracas suspended due to the alleged planning of terrorist acts asylum seekers within these premises.\nThe Argentine government said it is “moving forward” so that the six opponents “have absolutely no inconvenience”, despite the current circumstances.\n.\n#Opposition #refugees #Argentine #embassy #Venezuela #locked #months",

    "text": "100-year-old WWII veteran inducted into Bangor High School’s Veterans Honor Roll BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - The Veterans Honor Roll at Bangor High School grew by one esteemed member over the weekend. We were there as Bangor’s JROTC honored 100-year-old World War II veteran Don Gallupe at their Military Ball. Decades after graduating from Bangor High School, Gallupe returned to the halls of his alma mater. On Saturday, the Bangor JROTC put on their 88th Ram Battalion Military Ball. On Saturday, the Bangor JROTC put on their 88th Ram Battalion Military Ball. Amid the photo ops, dinner, and awards, there was another piece of business to attend to. A BHS Class of 1942 graduate, Gallupe became the ninth member of the Veterans Honor Roll. Cadet Captain Jake Biberstein says they first learned of Gallupe’s connection to the program in February when [TV5 aired a story on his 100th birthday celebration](https://www.wabi.tv/2024/02/07/bangor-wwii-veteran-celebrates-100th-birthday/). “We were watching it in class, and it really gave us this good push to put him in our honor roll, especially on a beautiful night like tonight,” said Biberstein. “It’s great to be able to induct Mr. Gallupe into the Honor Roll because all the hard work, now we get to see it pay off.” Gallupe served in the Army Air Corps during WWII as a gunner on the P-61 “Black Widow” night fighter plane. He was injured and spent eight months in the hospital. Gallupe is the recipient of a Purple Heart. He credits his time in the ROTC for preparing him to take on a leadership role immediately after enlistment. “Then they had a whole troop train that went down to Biloxi (Mississippi). I had all the papers for every guy who was on that train. Then I started to realize that the ROTC background meant something,” Gallupe said. After his induction, Gallupe ad-libbed a 10-minute acceptance speech laced with memories from his time at BHS. He finished by memorializing his seven siblings. All five Gallupe brothers served overseas, including Arthur, who was killed in action in WWII at the age of 24. “I always keep him in mind. Thank you very much for everything,” he concluded his speech, to a standing ovation. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

The taxpayers would be much better served by tying the $3 billion up with a red ribbon and giving it to Mr. Edens as a Christmas present, in exchange for his promise to stop right now and go no further. Otherwise, the bleeding will never stop.\n— Noel Park, Rancho Palos Verdes\nGreenhut is right about the Delta plan and water policy\nAbout 40 years ago, I stayed with a family in Puebla, Mexico as part of a Spanish language program.\nEvery day when I brushed my teeth, their 6 year-old-boy would hop up on the bathroom sink and monitor my water consumption by turning off the water “in between spits.”\nTo this day, I turn off and on the water when brushing and have become much more conscious of my water usage in general.\nIn his recent column, “Hate it or not, the Delta tunnel is badly needed” (Dec. 24) Steven Greenhut makes some salient points and despite being a self-declared environmentalist, I concur with his position\nHowever, I do have a question: why is there rarely (here or otherwise) any mention of individual conservation?\nWhy shouldn’t our water bills have a sliding rate based on consumption?\nIf we don’t balance the scale of supply and demand, there will always be future problems.\n— Jill Watkins, Laguna Beach\nHealthcare is in trouble with the new arrivals\nIf not already, America is starting the new year a mockery. Our crumbling sickcare system will be inundated with hundreds of thousands of immigrants regardless of status.\nPeople who, as the Dec.17 article on Medi-Cal expansion states, are sicker and die younger. I work in healthcare. I am dreading the new year due to the number of “urgent” Medi-Cal referrals I am seeing. These new patients will require far greater resources stretching beyond the limits our very overburdened and broken system. So much for us established patrons/citizens getting decent care.\n— Frances O’Neil, Santa Ana",

    "text": "WINK News LATEST NEWS When you think of people taking down human traffickers, you might picture uniformed agents with decades of training, but FGCU graduates took matters into their own hands, scraping the web for bad guys. Diego Grisales just graduated from FGCU with a degree in software engineering. “I did an internship [at] Amazon web services this summer, and last year, summer, and I’ll be working full time there,” Grisales said. So Grisales is off to Washington State, but he left his mark in Southwest Florida. “The project that we worked on with Diego’s team was focused on going after people that are committing human trafficking,” said John Yancey, resident agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations. Yancey spoke in one of Grisales’s classes in the spring, and that sparked an idea that turned into his final project in his Capstone class. Diego and two May grads created a web-scraping tool that hunts down traffickers. “It will open a website, right, and it would click on every single post, and we would find information in that post that might be related to human trafficking,” Grisales said. Grisales showed WINK how Netspider works. The software searches for many keywords, including travel, costumes, lingerie and different phones, and then once all the posts are flagged, the tool Grisales designed downloads that information. “Emails, phone numbers, the descriptions, payment methods, social media usernames, along with a screenshot, which is very useful for the agents for prosecution,” Grisales said. “The post changes all the time, every day. They may just have a post up for a day or two, right? And then it’s gone. The tool that he developed gave us the ability to capture an image, which could potentially be used as evidence. We can show a pattern,” Yancey said. Before Netspider, homeland security agents and others sat on a computer and manually reviewed each website and post. This new tool scans multiple posts at a time and multiple sites instantaneously. “Right out of the gate, as soon as we started using it, we were able to identify what were clear signs of human trafficking. We’ve been able to identify the same post that we located here in Southwest Florida being used in other parts of the country,” Yancy said. Yancey told WINK that his team worked hand in hand with Grisales. They gave the tech guys feedback on what keywords to have the system search, the information to save and the system allows you to remove or add words as the traffickers change their language. Homeland Security Investigations has been working with FGCU’s criminal justice students, but this was the first year they reached out to the tech students. They now plan to continue the partnership with the software engineers department.",

    "text": "Washington DC [US]: As the Russia-Ukraine conflict raged in 2022, the United States started \"preparing rigorously\" for a potential nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, in what would have been the first nuclear attack since the US dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly eighty years before, CNN reported citing two senior administration officials.\nThe report stated that outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries also played an important role in averting the crisis.\nThe Biden administration was specifically concerned Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said.\nAmid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, as reported by CNN.\n\"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\" the senior administration official said. US officials say that outreach and public statements from Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi and others helped avert a crisis.\n\"I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,\" CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying.\n\"I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,\" the senior administration official added. \"I can't demonstrate this positively, but I think that's our assessment.\" Regarding the\n Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In a major statement, PM Modi told President Putin that \"this is not the era of war\" on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year. The statement even made to the G20 communique under the presidency of India.\nDuring this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place \"in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it or deter it,\" the senior administration official said. Notably, late summer 2022 was also proving a 'devastating period' for Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were advancing on Russian-occupied Kherson in the south, the city which had been Russia's biggest prize since the invasion.\nAs these Ukrainian forces advanced, entire Russian units were in danger of being surrounded. The view inside the administration was that such a catastrophic loss could be a \"potential trigger\" for the use of nuclear weapons, according to CNN. Also, at the same time, Russia was allegedly circulating a new \"false flag story\" about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which US officials feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack.\nIn October 2022, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was \"concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.\"\nBut, it is pertinent to note that at no time did the US detect intelligence indicating Russia was taking steps to mobilize its nuclear forces to carry out such an attack, CNN reported. \"We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,\" a senior administration official said. \"And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would've expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.\" (ANI)\nAlso Read:\nRussia has no plan to station nuclear weapons in space: President Vladimir Putin\nAlso Watch:",
