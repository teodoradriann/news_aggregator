    "text": "Updated March 27th 2025, 19:54 IST\nLayoffs in 2025: Infosys, Block, IBM Among Firms Cutting Workforce | Full List Inside\nAmid economic challenges and AI advancements, companies like IBM, Boeing, Infosys, CNN, and Block have massively cut jobs in 2025.\nWorld News- 4 min read\nSnehal Jaiswal\nNew Delhi: In the wake of ongoing economic challenges, recession and advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Several major companies have recently announced job cuts, including IBM, Boeing, Infosys, CNN, Dropbox, Block, Adidas, and BlackRock. Despite these reductions, sectors like AI, fintech, and big data are expected to see growth by 2030.\nThis wave of mass layoffs around the globe has not left India untouched. On March 26, software giant Infosys terminated approximately 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru campus after they failed to pass internal assessments.\nLayoffs in 2025: List of Companies Laying off their Employees\nBlock: Jack Dorsey’s financial technology company, plans to lay off nearly 1,000 employees while implementing other operational changes in its second such move in just over a year. The layoffs will affect more than 930 employees, with nearly 200 managers transitioning into non-management roles, and around 800 open positions being closed.\nDorsey, who co-founded and previously ran Twitter before co-founding Block in 2009, informed employees of the upcoming cuts on Tuesday via an email titled “smaller block,” which was viewed by the Guardian.\nInternational Business Machines: IBM, known as ‘Big Blue,’ is reportedly cutting jobs across various U.S. locations as part of an ongoing workforce reduction in the tech industry. The company’s decision follows a wave of layoffs this year affecting thousands of employees.\nAccording to The Register, IBM’s job cuts are targeting around a quarter of its workforce within its Classic Cloud operations. While the exact number of affected employees remains undisclosed, the layoffs are expected to impact thousands. IBM has yet to make an official announcement on the matter.\nBoeing: On February 8, Boeing announced plans to cut 400 roles from its moon rocket program due to delays and rising costs associated with NASA's Artemis moon exploration missions. A spokesperson stated that impacted employees will receive 60-day notices of involuntary layoffs in the coming weeks.\nInfosys: Software giant Infosys terminated approximately 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru campus on March 26, after they failed to pass internal assessments. However, the company is offering alternative career paths to the affected trainees, including a 12-week training program for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM).\nIn addition, Infosys is providing impacted trainees with a one-month ex-gratia payment and a relieving letter. For those who choose not to pursue the BPM course, the company has offered to fund further training to help them explore other career opportunities.\nAdidas: In January, Adidas announced plans to reduce its workforce at its headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany, potentially cutting up to 500 jobs, according to CNBC. This would represent nearly a 9% reduction in the headquarters' workforce, which currently employs around 5,800 people, as per the Adidas website.\nThe announcement of the layoffs came shortly after Adidas reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2024, surpassing its profit expectations. Despite strong financial performance, the company proceeded with the workforce reduction as part of ongoing restructuring efforts.\nCNN: CNN announced a reduction of about 200 television-focused roles, accounting for approximately 6% of its workforce, as part of a shift toward a digital-first strategy. In a memo sent to staff on January 23, CNN CEO Mark Thompson emphasized the need to \"shift CNN's gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting\" to secure the company’s future as a leading global news organization.\nBlackRock: In January, BlackRock informed employees of plans to cut around 200 jobs from its 21,000-strong workforce, according to Bloomberg. However, these reductions are offset by the addition of 3,750 new hires last year and another 2,000 expected in 2025. BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and COO, Rob Goldstein, stated that the layoffs were part of an effort to realign the firm's resources with its strategic goals.\nAmid ongoing economic uncertainties and restructuring across industries, the wave of mass layoffs in the tech sector continues without indication of slowing down.\nPublished March 27th 2025, 19:54 IST",

O novo dono da SAF Cruzeirense ‘ameaçou’ Fernando Seabra caso ele não escalasse Kaio Jorge.\nAdeus Fernando Seabra? “ Ou você escala os jogadores que contratou ou você pode arrumando a sua mala aí que não passa desse jogo não’. Falei com ele que se não precisasse desses jogadores eu não teria contratado e ficaria só com os que estão aqui. Aí eu dei uma dura nele do caramba ”, disse o empresário.\nAinda completou dizendo: “ Vai jogar hoje no ataque com o Lautaro, que é o argentino que veio, e o Kaio Jorge. O Matheus Henrique no meio, e o Walace vai ficar no banco porque ainda não está 100%. Mas vão jogar três dos contratados, vão sair de titular. Vamos ver o que vai dar.

    "title": "High-Fat Diet During Adolescence Increases Impulsive Behaviors in Adult Rodents",
    "text": "For adults, a diet high in saturated fats and added sugar has been linked to impulsivity and poor self-control. But what role, if any, does diet play in adolescent psychological development? Researchers report in ACS Chemical Neuroscience that adolescent rodents fed a high-fat diet showed poor control during motor inhibition tasks and conservative decision-making in gambling scenarios as adults. This information could provide insights into human development.\nDiet is one of many factors — like sleep, exercise and substance use — expected to affect an adolescent’s cognitive development and reward-seeking behavior. Previously, researchers collected evidence that supports the importance of sleep and exercise on behavioral development, but there is limited data about the effects of specific patterns of eating. So, Santiago Mora and colleagues designed experiments to look at the potential influences of a high-fat diet during adolescence on the actions and choices of adult rats.\nFor the experiments, Mora’s team fed 20 young rats a high-fat diet of cheesecake (cheesecake rats) and another 20 a nutritionally balanced chow diet (chow rats). When the rodents reached adulthood, the researchers trained all 40 to perform multiple tasks, including a gambling scenario. These attention and inhibitory-control tasks allowed the researchers to evaluate the animals’ abilities to manage impulsive and compulsive actions and make safe decisions. Task evaluations revealed that adult cheesecake rats prematurely responded to visual cues (i.e., jumping the gun to get a tasty snack), which the researchers say is evidence of increased impulsive actions. However, the adult cheesecake rats exhibited less risky decision-making by opting for safer but smaller rewards during gambling scenarios (i.e., no high rolling in casinos) than the adult chow rats.\nIn additional tests, the researchers identified genetic differences between the cheesecake and chow rats’ prefrontal cortices (one of the parts of the brain that control behavior and personality) and gut metabolism biomarkers. Briefly, the cheesecake rats exhibited altered function of the mesolimbic pathway — the so-called reward pathway — in their brains and had modified levels of fatty acids in their guts linked to neurological and behavioral outcomes. The results suggest that a high-fat diet during adolescence could interfere with brain development and affect neurobehavioral outcomes in adulthood.\nThe researchers say that their data show a high-fat diet in adolescence can provoke long-term changes in impulsive behavior in rats, but they recognize more research is needed to “disentangle the specific mechanisms underlying these intriguing effects.”\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the European Regional Development Fund (Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional) and Ministry of Health, Government of Spain (Ministerio de Sanidad, Gobierno de España).

    "text": "En vísperas de Año Nuevo, Acapulco reportó 70.1 por ciento de ocupación en las 4 mil 534 habitaciones que hay disponibles en el puerto. Este recibimiento se da a más de dos meses del paso del huracán Otis por el puerto, lo que destruyó 80 por ciento de hoteles. Previo a la celebración de fin de año, este sábado continuó el arribo de visitantes principalmente de estados vecinos como Ciudad de México, Puebla, Morelos y Estado de México. En el caso de algunas familias, como la de los Sánchez Carmona, viajaron a la ciudad para escapar de las bajas temperaturas y “para ver cómo quedó Acapulco”, dijo Bertha Carmona Díaz. Así como ellos, decenas de familias han buscado hospedarse en los 127 hoteles que funcionan hasta ahora, y otros más han optado por acampar en la arena de playas como Papagayo y Manzanillo. “Nos quedaremos aquí para disfrutar de la Gala de Pirotecnia. Esperábamos que no nos dejaran, pero hasta ahora todos han sido muy amables. Nosotros venimos porque queremos ayudar a que se levante y descansar”, añadió Sara, turista de Ecatepec, Estado de México. PIROTECNIA, LA ATRACCIÓN La Gala de Pirotecnia representa para los restauranteros el último empuje para la reactivación. Algunos de ellos consideran que el espectáculo era una ayuda para subsanar un poco sus bolsillos, afectados por la baja afluencia de turistas. Los platillos para recibir el 2024 en la franja de arena de la zona Dorada fueron vendidos desde los 899 pesos por persona hasta los mil 355 pesos. “Las reservaciones no han sido igual que antes, porque evidentemente se redujo la capacidad de los restaurantes, pero en general hay buena respuesta de las familias”, dijo César Pérez, encargado de uno de estos comercios. Para esta celebración, el Gobierno de Guerrero alistó 17 plataformas de pirotecnia distribuidas a lo largo de la bahía de Santa Lucía, donde en punto de la medianoche se detonaron más de 10 mil disparos de fuegos artificiales. Al igual que el año pasado, 700 drones ofrecieron un espectáculo que pudo observarse durante diez minutos, desde la Condesa y el Parque de la Reina, clave en el puerto. - 70.1 por ciento es el estimado de la ocupación hotelera. - 4 mil 534 camas disponibles. - 127 hoteles abrieron puertas. OFRECEN SHOW 1.- Guerrero alistó 17 plataformas de juegos pirotécnicos. 2.- A la medianoche se detonaron 10 mil fuegos. 3.- Al menos 700 drones participaron en el espectáculo. PAL",
