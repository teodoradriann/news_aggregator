Vogliamo che 'confine' assuma un nuovo significato, come luogo di opportunità e non di separazione\".\n Fra gli scrittori e scrittrici del Friuli Venezia Giulia ci saranno Claudio Magris, Susanna Tamaro, Mauro Covacich e Paolo Rumiz, Chiara Carminati, il direttore artistico di Pordenonelegge Gian Mario Villalta e l'artista Lorenzo Mattotti.\n Venerdì 18 ottobre alle 11.30 si parlerà di \"Attraversare i confini: ridefinire le frontiere dell'editoria\", con la presentazione del panorama editoriale regionale. Sabato 19 ottobre, nella stessa sede, dalle 17.30 si parlerà di \"Friuli Venezia Giulia, un luogo di parole e storie\", seconda parte della presentazione del panorama editoriale regionale. Diego Marani interverrà come protagonista del panel e vincitore della quinta edizione del Premio Letterario Friuli Venezia Giulia \"Il racconto dei luoghi e del tempo\", promosso dalla Regione e dalla Fondazione Pordenonelegge.it.\n Diversi gli eventi anche al Fuori Salone della Frankfurter Buchmesse: una messa in scena su testi di Claudio Magris dalla raccolta di racconti \"Tempo curvo a Krems\", la prima proiezione assoluta del documentario \"Italo Svevo. Scrivere nascosto a Trieste\", scritto e diretto dal regista Alessandro Melazzini, e la mostra \"Carlo Dalla Mura 1927-2022\", a cura del CRAF di Spilimbergo.",

ALLISON ROBBERT/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of rigging dogecoin is ending.\nInvestors in the cryptocurrency who said the world's richest person and his electric car company Tesla committed fraud and insider trading are withdrawing their appeal from an Aug. 29 dismissal of their case.\nThey are also withdrawing a bid to sanction Musk's lawyers for allegedly interfering with the appeal, including by demanding payment of their hefty legal fees.\nMusk and Tesla, meanwhile, withdrew their motion to sanction the investors' lawyer for allegedly pursuing a \"frivolous\" case with ever-changing legal theories to \"extort a quick handout.\"\nA stipulation dismissing the appeal and both sides' motions was filed on Thursday night in federal court in Manhattan. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein.\nLawyers for the investors and Musk did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.\nInvestors accused Musk of using Twitter posts, an appearance on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" and other stunts to trade dogecoin at their expense, including by timing trades to Musk's public statements and activities.\nIn the Aug. 29 dismissal, Hellerstein said reasonable investors could not prove securities fraud from relying on Musk's tweets, including that dogecoin was the future currency of Earth and could be flown to the moon by his company SpaceX.\nThe judge also said he did not understand the investors' related market manipulation and insider trading claims.\nInvestors originally sought $258 billion, and amended their complaint four times in two years.\nMusk bought Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it X.\nOn Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump picked Musk and biotechnology company founder Vivek Ramaswany to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, whose acronym echoes dogecoin's name.\nThe case is Gorog et al v. Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-05037.\nSponsored Bank Accounts\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters .\nTags: United States",

Mascherano se mostró \"preocupado\" tanto por el resultado \"como la manera\": \"Nos pusieron desde el principio bajo una gran presión, no estábamos frescos. Nos han ganado muy bien\".\nEl técnico argentino abogó por \"dar la vuelta a la página\" y por \"descansar y juntar energías\" para el partido que disputarán el sábado ante el New York Red Bulls antes de afrontar una semana sin partido intersemanal. \"Tenemos que buscar entre dosificar, no resentir al equipo, competir y ganar.

    "text": "NBA NBA News: Nuggets star takes subtle jab at LeBron James, Lakers for last season The Los Angeles Lakers suffered a first-round exit in the 2024 NBA Playoffs, but a Denver Nuggets star believes LeBron James and company could've done much better.\nNBA Rumors: Stephen Curry issues serious warning to the Golden State Warriors Not Messi or Ronaldo: LeBron James' son Bronny looks up to another soccer star By Martín O’donnell\nJuly 25, 2024 06:56PM EDT\nwhatsapp\nJuly 25, 2024 06:56PM EDT\n© Justin Ford/Getty Images LeBron James #23 of the Los Angeles Lakers looks on during the first half against the Memphis Grizzlies at FedExForum on March 27, 2024 in Memphis, Tennessee. By Martín O’donnell\nThe Los Angeles Lakers left a lot to be desired last season, losing to the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs. Of course, LeBron James and company could’ve avoided this with a better seed in the regular season.\nThe Nuggets , who arrived in the series as the reigning champions, managed to knock out the Lakers in five games. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , however, believes LeBron James and company should have won the series .\n“You know how like, towards the playoffs guys get their rest. But I felt like that’s where we spent most of our energy and time trying to get that first place and playing catch-up. And we get to the playoffs, we have no gas. We felt like the Lakers should have beaten us. We were down every game,” Caldwell-Pope said on the Draymond Green Show . “At least 10 [points], I think the highest may be what, 20-something. Just taking that energy and using it there so it was a lot that went into that season .”\nIt was a surprising elimination by the Lakers since they led at halftime in every game against the Nuggets and held double-digit leads in three of their four losses. However, Denver managed to outscore LeBron James and company when it mattered the most, and it paid off.\nAnthony Davis #3, LeBron James #23, Quinn Cook #2 and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope #1 of the Los Angeles Lakers pose during the 2020 NBA championship ring ceremony before their opening night game against the Los Angeles Clippers at Staples Center on December 22, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.\nJJ Redick believes LeBron, Lakers can succeed With Darvin Ham gone after the first-round elimination, the Lakers hired JJ Redick aiming to maximize LeBron James’ championship window before it’s too late. Even though we’re talking about a rookie head coach with a very similar roster from last season, the new bench boss believes LA has what it takes to contend.\nsee also\nNBA Rumors: After drafting Bronny, Lakers could have even better news for LeBron James\n“ I don’t look at the current roster as being that far off from a championship-caliber team. In terms of managing expectations, I think in life, you just got to embrace things. You know, you just really have to embrace things. You don’t run from it. If you need to talk about it, you talk about it .”\n“… And if the Los Angeles Lakers on day one get better every single day, I’m very confident that come April, we will be a championship-caliber team . You still have to have a lot of stuff go right, you can’t have a lot go wrong. That’s every single championship team. … You certainly need the stars. But the group matters more than ever. You need six, seven, eight guys who can play minutes deep into the playoffs. The Boston Celtics, the Dallas Mavericks, the Pacers, the Timberwolves. It wasn’t about the individual. It was about the group.”\nMartín O’donnell\nMartin O'Donnell is a bilingual sports writer fluent in English and Spanish, with a Bachelor’s degree in Communications.
