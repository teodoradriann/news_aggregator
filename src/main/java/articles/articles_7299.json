    "text": "Political turmoil in Bangladesh has affected cross-border passenger and freight rail with its neighbour, India. Just a month after a new trade route was agreed, putting Indian Railways wagons on Bangldeshi tracks, the political situation deteriorated quickly. Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned after mass protests through July and left Dhaka on 5 August. She fled the country and is understood to be in India. According to Indian English-language newspaper The Hindu, Indian Railways suspended all cross-border services on the very same day Hasina quit and fled. But the train trouble didn’t start when the former prime minister left. The months-long protest movement against Hasina was already disrupting freight and passenger services, according to Bangladeshi officials. The Bangladeshi rail officials had reportedly been in communication with Indian colleagues throughout the trouble, and had cancelled services on numerous occasions.

    "title": "Chiefs Recognize SSG Danny Tucker as a Tribute to the Troops Honoree Presented by Crown Royal",
    "text": "They devote their lives to protecting those that they've never met, selflessly stepping forward to defend all that we hold dear in this country. These individuals don't join the service for recognition or fame, it's just simply what they feel called to do, forgoing personal ambition to become a part of something much larger than themselves. They're the brave few who make up our Armed Forces, and some of our nation's very best are right here in Chiefs Kingdom. The Chiefs have a rich history of supporting our men and women in uniform throughout the years, including through the \"Tribute to the Troops\" program at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, which recognizes the real heroes in our community during every home game. That initiative took place once again earlier this season, as SSG Danny Tucker was recognized as the \"Tribute to the Troops\" honoree presented by Crown Royal during the Chiefs' matchup with the Buffalo Bills. A nine-year veteran of the Army, SSG Tucker – following the example set by his grandparents – envisioned a career in the service from an early age. \"I'd always wanted to join the military,\" Tucker said. \"The discipline and structure of the military always just appealed to me.\" That desire nearly led SSG Tucker to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to play football, but a knee injury disrupted those plans. Still, while it wasn't on the path that he originally hoped to follow, SSG Tucker remained steadfast in his pursuit of service. \"After my knee surgery, I earned a scholarship to run track and field at Park University,\" Tucker recalled. \"I found out that they had an ROTC program, and a year later, I was sworn into the military.\" SSG Tucker went on to prove himself worthy of leadership in the years that followed, earning the responsibility of being a scout team leader. \"My job is essentially manning command and control of anywhere between six to eight other senior enlisted soldiers,\" Tucker explained. \"The scout section is what we can a specialty platoon. We carry a three-day pack into an area on a mission, and we're responsible for relaying information and gathering intelligence.\" It's a critical role that sets various operations up for success, and for SSG Tucker – who has a true appreciation and passion for leadership – it's a responsibility that he doesn't take lightly. In fact, it's something that he began preparing for long before he earned his own command. \"You have to follow before you can lead,\" Tucker said. \"I've always wanted to be the guy with the big ideas, but as part of my evolution in the military, I learned – as a follower – how leaders handled certain situations. I took that and now apply it to my own role.\" SSG Tucker has gone on to earn his fair share of accolades, too, as he was named the Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year for both Missouri and the seven-state region in 2023. He represents the very best of what makes our nation's Armed Forces so special, and as the Chiefs took on the Bills earlier this year, the crowd at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium had an opportunity to show their appreciation for his dedication to our country. \"It was very heartwarming to feel that support from not only the Chiefs, but also the fans,\" Tucker said. \"We brought my son, and he absolutely loved it. I'm originally from Texas, but ever since I moved here, the Chiefs Kingdom has always kind of made this feel like home for me. It was a surreal experience to be at the game, and it really felt like home.\"",

    "text": "Football Angleterre : Battu par West Ham, Arsenal laisse sa place de leader à Liverpool Liverpool reste sur le trône de la Premier League après la contre-performance de son désormais dauphin, Arsenal, battu à l'Emirates Stadium par West Ham (2-0) jeudi en conclusion d’une 19e journée qui aura vu perdre trois des cinq équipes de tête. Cinq jours après avoir accroché les Reds à Anfield Road (1-1), Arsenal a contre toute attente cédé face à l'équipe qui l'avait éliminée de la Coupe de la Ligue début novembre. Les Hammers ont donné raison à l'analyse de leur entraîneur David Moyes, qui assurait avant le match que cette année était la meilleure de l'histoire du club, avec notamment un triomphe en Ligue Europa Conférence. Ils n'ont pas concédé la moindre occasion dans la première demi-heure de jeu, et même marqué peu avant le quart d'heure après une mauvaise appréciation de Gabriel Magalhaes, qui a profité à Tomas Soucek (0-1, 13e). L'ancien défenseur Lillois a également perdu un duel aérien décisif en seconde période face à Konstantinos Mavropanos, suite à un corner de Ward-Prowse (2-0, 55e). Un manque de réalisme côté Gunners Souvent efficaces face au but depuis le début de la saison, les Gunners ont cette fois manqué de réalisme avec Saka (30e, 42e), Martinelli (37e), Gabriel Jesus (66e) puis Trossard dans le dernier quart d'heure. Le score aurait pu être plus cruel si Benrahma avait transformé son penalty dans le temps additionnel. Les rentrées en jeu successives de Nketiah, Nelson et Smith Rowe ont rappelé le manque de profondeur de banc à disposition de Mikel Arteta. Arsenal compte deux points de retard sur Liverpool, alors que West Ham, 6e, est à l'affut des places européennes, à trois points de Tottenham et quatre points de Manchester City, vainqueur mardi à Everton (3-1) et qui compte un match de plus à disputer. Tottenham rechute lourdement Peu avant, Tottenham avait sévèrement rechuté sur le terrain de Brighton (4-2) et raté l'occasion de se rapprocher de la tête du championnat. Tottenham était pourtant la meilleure équipe à l'extérieur avant cette rencontre et finit la première moitié de saison sur une note négative, malgré une bonne cinquième place au classement, à un point de Manchester City. Meilleurs ces dernières semaines après un mois de novembre catastrophique sur le plan des résultats, les Spurs ont montré un visage inhabituel avec beaucoup de passivité, comme sur cette action individuelle de Joao Pedro qui a pu passer en revue quatre joueurs et donner une balle en or à Jack Hinshelwood, démarqué à l'entrée de la surface de réparation (1-0, 11e). Entre plusieurs occasions nettes pour Brighton (17e, 32e, 45e), le même Joao Pedro allait ensuite transformer deux pénalties (23e, 75e), avec entre-temps une frappe puissante de Pervis Estupinan dans la lucarne opposée de Vicario (63e). Alejo Veliz (81e) et Ben Davies (85e) ont réduit le score, trop tard pour faire douter les Seagulls. Brighton se repositionne à la huitième place, à six points de la première place européenne.",

This groundbreaking method, previously existing only in theory, has now been experimentally proven for the first time, opening up new possibilities in the development of innovative drugs through extensive research on the effects of anticancer precursors on the human body.\nCredit: UNIST\nA research team, affiliated with UNIST has unveiled a novel method to produce a selective anticancer precursor substance that targets and eliminates cancer cells. This groundbreaking method, previously existing only in theory, has now been experimentally proven for the first time, opening up new possibilities in the development of innovative drugs through extensive research on the effects of anticancer precursors on the human body.\nLed by Professor Jaeheung Cho of the Department of Chemistry at UNIST, the research team has successfully demonstrated that the synthesis of hydroxymato cobalt (III), a potential candidate substance for anticancer precursors, involves the reaction of metal-active oxygen species with nitrile. Unlike previous studies that relied on expensive heavy metals, this new method utilizes cost-effective metals and operates at lower temperatures.\nNitrile, a compound widely used in pharmaceuticals and agricultural pesticides, has proven challenging to synthesize. However, the research team has now confirmed that the reaction between nitriles and cobalt-hydroperoxo species, a type of metal-active oxygen species, leads to the synthesis of peroxyimidateto cobalt (III). This finding reveals that peroxyimidateto cobalt (III) is an intermediate substance formed during the chemical reaction, ultimately producing hydroxymiteto cobalt (III).\nTo synthesize cobalt (III)-peroxyimidato complexes, the research team introduced a new species known as acobalt(III)-hydroperoxo specifications. Remarkably, they discovered that the reaction occurs when -hydroperoxo is nucleophilic-attacked with nitrile. Moreover, it was observed that the addition of a base to peroxymidato cobalt (III) transforms it into hydroxymito cobalt (III), enabling the synthesis of precursors.\nThe research team placed particular emphasis on the significance of the basicity of metal-dioxygen specifications, specifically the metal-(hydro)peroxo [M–O2(H)] complex species. By controlling the atoms bound to the cobalt-hydroperoxo species that did not react with nitrile, they successfully increased basicity, thereby enabling rapid reactions even at low temperatures.\nTo further investigate the structural aspects of cobalt(III)-hydroperoxo specifications, the research team employed computational chemistry simulations, which leverage the power of computer computing to analyze chemical phenomena. These simulations highlighted the impact of changes in the combination of atoms on the structure of cobalt(III)-hydroperoxo specifications, reaffirming the crucial role of basicity.\nCommenting on the significance of this study, Professor Cho stated, “This research unveils the underlying mechanisms of metal-active oxygen species in activating nitrile, serving as a foundation for the future development of catalysts capable of activating nitrile.”\nIn this study, Professor Cho served as the corresponding author of the study, with researcher Son Young-jin as the first author. The study findings have been published in the online version of JACS Au on October 31, 2023. This research was made possible with the support of the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, organized by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF).\nJournal Reference\nYeongjin Son, Donghyun Jeong, Kyungmin Kim, and Jaeheung Cho, “Mechanistic Insights into Nitrile Activation by Cobalt(III)–Hydroperoxo Intermediates: The Influence of Ligand Basicity,” JACS Au, (2023).\nJournal\nJACS Au\nArticle Title\nMechanistic Insights into Nitrile Activation by Cobalt(III)–Hydroperoxo Intermediates: The Influence of Ligand Basicity\nArticle Publication Date\n31-Oct-2023",

    "title": "DA constructs cold storage facility to help onion growers in Ilocos Sur - Philippine Information Agency",
    "text": "VIGAN CITY, Ilocos Sur (PIA) – Onion growers in Ilocos Sur will soon have access to a new cold storage facility being constructed in Barangay Don Alejandro Quirolgico in Caoayan, Ilocos Sur. The cold storage facility is a project under the Investment in Rural Enterprises and Agriculture and Fisheries Productivity (IREAP) component of the Department of Agriculture (DA)-Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP) and will be managed by the Nueva Segovia Consortium Cooperative (NSCC). The facility will have an 810-metric-ton capacity to secure a sufficient supply of onions in the province and help farmers achieve higher income and productivity. It aims to benefit the three main cooperatives in the province, namely the NSCC Multi-Purpose Cooperative, the Sacred Heart Savings Cooperative, and the Pantay Onion Producers Cooperative, which has a total of 140 members. This was in response to a surplus of onion production, which led to a shortage after the harvested onions were not stored and left to spoil. “With this cold storage facility, pwedeng i-imbak ng mga magsasaka natin ang kanilang mga harvest during the peak of harvesting season para makapag-demand sila ng good price… For example, ngayon, sobra-sobra ang produksyon ng sibuyas kaya bumaba nang bumaba ang presyo, so with this cold storage kung sobra ang production, pwede i-imbak muna ang mga ito at ilalabas siya sa tamang presyo pagdating ng mga, let’s say December kapag nag-spike ito. Makatutulong ito sa ating mga magsasaka sapagkat maiiwasan ang pagbebenta nila ng mga harvest nila sa bagsak presyo,” said Doris Joy Garcia, component head of PRDP Local and National Levels Planning of the DA-Regional Field Office 1, in an interview following the fourth episode of the Kapihan sa Bagong Pilipinas on June 18. (We experienced a problem with excess onion production, leading to a shortage. Our solution was establishing a cold storage facility in Ilocos Sur to help farmers store their harvests during peak seasons. This allows them to wait for better prices. For example, today there is an overabundance of onions, causing prices to drop. However, with cold storage, excess produce can be stored and released when prices are higher, such as in December. This will benefit farmers by enabling them to avoid selling their harvests at low prices.) Garcia said that they will also conduct training programs for farmers on proper post-harvest handling and the management of cold storage facilities to ensure effective utilization of the facility. According to the Provincial Agriculturist Office, there are three varieties of onions planted in the province: red and white onions, and shallots, with shallots being the most common among the three. In 2023, onion growers in the province planted a total of 155.69 hectares and recorded a production of more than 6,600 metric tons of onions. With the facility set to be completed by November 2024, it is expected that issues such as high spoilage, supply shortages, and low marketing will be addressed. (AMB/JMCQ, PIA Ilocos Sur)",

    "title": "Energy CEOs Call for Carney to Scrap Emissions Cap, Industrial Carbon Tax",
    "text": "Canada’s top energy CEOs have penned an\nopen letterto Prime Minister Mark Carney, asking him to get rid of the emissions cap on oil and gas producers and repeal industrial carbon pricing in order to build Canada’s economy.The leaders of 38 companies said in their April 30 letter that the country’s oil and gas sector would create jobs and increase tax revenue for government, but it must be allowed to grow. They said there has been a lack of investment in Canada’s energy infrastructure when compared to the United States.\n“As a major contributor to the Canadian economy, with significant untapped potential, the energy sector must play a pivotal role in your pursuit of this ambition,” the letter says, referring to Carney’s goal of building the fastest-growing economy in the G7.\nThe CEOs request that the federal government revise the Impact Assessment Act and the oil tanker ban on B.C.’s north coast, and streamline regulatory processes that are “complex, unpredictable, subjective, and excessively long.”\nThe CEOs also ask for a reduction in regulatory timelines to allow approval of major projects within six months of application, calling the Liberal government’s proposed two-year timeframe for reviewing nationally significant projects “a positive step, but insufficient.”\nThe letter said Ottawa’s emissions cap for the sector should be eliminated, as it creates investor uncertainty and will result in limited growth and production cuts in the sector. The Liberal government announced a cap-and-trade scheme in 2023 to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe federal government’s industrial carbon tax is also “not globally cost competitive” and should be repealed to allow provincial governments to set their own regulations, according to the CEOs. “The current federal price and stringency trajectory results in uncompetitive costs compared to those we compete with to deliver our products to market,” they wrote.\nPrime Minister Mark Carney got rid of the consumer carbon tax when he became leader in March. But Carney has pledged to replace it with a new system rewarding Canadians for making lower-emission choices like buying electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances, and will\ndevelopa new “consumer carbon credit market” and make “big polluters pay” for this system.Additionally, the letter calls for the provision of loan guarantees for indigenous communities to ensure they benefit from the development. It said the doubling of the Indigenous Loan Guarantee Program to $10 billion is a good step, but will only be effective if “Canada fosters a competitive investment environment.”\nCarney has been ambiguous in recent months about whether his government would support building new pipelines across Canada. Carney said during an interview in April that the government would need to “choose a few projects, a few big projects, not necessarily pipelines, but maybe pipelines, we'll see,” and an April 9\npress releasesaid his government would be focused on building “an East-West electricity grid.”Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said on April 14 that Carney’s position on building pipelines had been the “exact opposite” of what he had said when he visited Alberta a few weeks ago.

In his address, Menfi said such an approach would contribute to establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. He condemned the ongoing \"atrocities\" faced by Palestinians under occupation, including massacres, displacement, land usurpation, and settlement activities. \"The Palestinian issue represents the plight of people who have been under occupation for decades, facing the longest-standing refugee crisis, the most significant protection crisis, and the most extensive justice crisis in modern history.\" The summit, with broad Arab and Islamic representation, discussed ongoing Israeli aggression in Gaza, exceeding 100 days with over 24,000 fatalities and 61,000 injuries. Additionally, the summit addressed global crises, including the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war and its impact on grain exports, crucial for Africa and Asia.",

    "text": "El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, publicó este jueves 28 de diciembre un nuevo capítulo de su podcast. En esta ocasión, el jefe de Estado habló con Alex Saab, quien recientemente fue dejado en libertad por la justicia de Estado Unidos.\nAnte de empezar la charla, el máximo mandatario se refirió al crimen de Tirone González, más conocido como Canserbero, el rapero venezolano que fue asesinado en el 2015 y que en las últimas horas se confirmó que quien lo mató fue su manager Natalia Améstica. Maduro resaltó el trabajo realizado por el fiscal general de Venezuela, Tarek William Saab, por esclarecer el hecho y haber alcanzado la justicia.\nEl jefe de Estado venezolano se refirió por primera vez al asesinato de Canserbero.\n“Aprovecho este podcast para hacerle un reconocimiento público al fiscal, hacerle un reconocimiento a todo su equipo de trabajo por haber hecho justicia y haber encontrado la verdad en el caso de Canserbero”, dijo.\nEl mandatario le envió un mensaje a la familia y todos los seres cercanos al artista afirmando que “ahí va la justicia tratando de sanar las heridas del dolor, de haber perdido a este talento venezolano tan joven”.\nEsta fue la primer declaración pública que hizo Maduro acerca del testimonio de la exmanager de Canserbero, que confesó haberlo matado junto a su esposo. Además, la mujer sostuvo que en el crimen están involucrados funcionarios del Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional (SEBIN), quienes supuestamente habrían ayudado a modificar la escena del crimen para que todo pareciera un suicidio.\nAsí fue la confesión de la exmanager\nCanserbero fue asesinado por su mánager\nPor medio de un video, el cual ha causado impacto y se ha viralizado en redes sociales, la mujer dio a conocer, minuciosamente, los detalles sobre cómo llevó a cabo el crimen del artista y su esposo Carlos Molnar. Además, confesó haber contado con el apoyo de su hermano Guillermo y algunos implicados en el asesinato, quienes les habría ayudado a modificar el escenario.\nNatalia Améstica dijo haber drogado con diez dosis de un ansiolítico a Tirone González y a Carlos Molnar. Luego, confesó haberles propinado puñaladas en diferentes áreas del cuerpo hasta provocar su muerte.\n“Sin saber qué hacer, desesperada, llamé a mi hermano Guillermo para que me ayudara a resolver esa situación. Él (Guillermo) llegó a las 11 de la noche acompañado de tres funcionarios del Sebin (Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional), los cuales desconozco su nombre. Ellos terminaron de arreglar la escena para que fuera un homicidio-suicidio”, señaló, descartando toda teoría de suicidio, tal y como se conoció en el primer informe.\nAdicionalmente, agregó que el cuerpo del artista recibió, con un objeto contundente, varios impactos para después ser aventado desde un edificio en la ciudad de Maracay.\n“Yo después de esto me fui a Chile huyendo aterrada, pensando que al final se iba a saber la verdad. Por eso regreso a dar las declaraciones pertinentes”, concluyó la exmánager.\nNatalia Améstica confesó haber asesinado a Canserbero y a su esposo Carlos Molnar.\nA los confesos asesinos se les acusa de “homicidio calificado por motivos fútiles y con alevosía en grado de complicidad”, como de “simulación de hecho punible”.\nLa prensa habló en principio de un suicidio y luego reseñó que las circunstancias de su muerte eran confusas. El caso estaba siendo llevado por una Fiscalía en Aragua. Así, tras varios años, finalmente se logró justicia en uno de los raperos más importantes del último tiempo.",

    "text": "Medioambiente\nEl Supremo de EEUU frena otra medida de Biden para luchar contra la contaminación\nLa mayoría conservadora deja en suspenso una regulación que trata de limitar la contaminación que viaja entre estados\nIdoya Noain\nLos esfuerzos por proteger y mejorar el medioambiente en\n[Estados Unidos](/tags/estados-unidos/) desde el gobierno federal han topado con un enemigo formidable en el Tribunal Supremo dominado por los conservadores. Este jueves cinco de los seis jueces de esa supermayoría conservadora han obligado a echar el freno a una medida adoptada por la Agencia de Protección Ambiental (EPA por sus siglas en inglés) con la que el gobierno de [Joe Biden ](/tags/joe-biden/)pretendía reducir la contaminación de ozono que viaja de unos estados a otros provocando niebla tóxica que se ha vinculado a asma, enfermedades pulmonares y muertes prematuras.\nSe trata de la tercera decisión en los tres últimos años que este Supremo toma contra medidas gubernamentales para combatir el cambio climático y reducir emisiones y contaminación. Llega después de otras dos adoptadas contra la misma agencia por las que le forzó a reducir protecciones al agua y le impidió aplicar un ambicioso plan para reducir emisiones de plantas de carbón. Esa tendencia ha llevado a expertos como Charles Harper, del grupo contra el cambio climático Evergreen, a denunciar que el Alto Tribunal demuestra que “cada vez más sustituye con sus propias políticas de derechas la pericia de las agencias federales”.\n\"Buenos vecinos\"\nLa norma que el Supremo ha dejado en suspenso formaba parte de un plan que la EPA empezó a diseñar en 2015 amparándose en la Ley de Aire Limpio para reducir la\n[contaminación ](/tags/contaminacion/)y la niebla tóxica que viaja de estados con muchas emisiones, normalmente en el sureste y el medio oeste, a otros que tienen menos, principalmente en el noreste. Esa regulación conocida como “de buen vecino” obligaba a los estados a enviar propuestas para reducir emisiones de ozono en plantas eléctricas y en otras instalaciones industriales que luego debía aprobar la agencia.\nPara 2023 la EPA concluyó que los planes presentados por 23 estados no eran adecuados y adoptó su propia normativa, lo que abrió una batalla legal. En 11 de los estados sí se aplicó la normativa federal y se han visto reducciones notables de las emisiones. De hecho, el año pasado en esos estados se registró una reducción total del 18% óxido de nitrógeno.\nOtros 12 mantuvieron su batalla legal, argumentando que les preocupa que en el futuro puedan cambiarse sus obligaciones bajo el plan y denunciando que las nuevas regulaciones son demasiado onerosas y llevarán al límite su servicio eléctrico. Esas batallas legales estaban abiertas pero en febrero Ohio, Virginia Occidental e Indiana, con aliados en sectores de industria pesada y minería, lograron que el Supremo aceptara una solicitud de emergencia, algo extraño pues el Alto Tribunal suele esperar a que se resuelvan los litigios en instancias inferiores.\nSolo Amy Coney Barrett, nombrada por\n[Donald Trump](/tags/donald-trump/), se ha sumado a las tres juezas progresistas rechazando la decisión, que ahora devuelve la pelea legal a tribunales inferiores pero deja la regulación suspendida mientras se resuelven los casos, un proceso que puede prolongarse durante años.
