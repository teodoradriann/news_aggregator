Nas penalidades, o Tricolor Paulista levou a melhor por 5 a 4.\nPara o São Paulo, Paulinho, Maik, Hugo, Negrucci e Ryan Francisco converteram suas cobranças. No Fluminense, Fabinho, Léo Jance, Gorgulho e Kevin Samuel, além do pênalti perdido por Fidélis.\nO jogo foi equilibrado com chances para as duas equipes. O São Paulo, inclusive, teve dois gols anulados por impedimento. Já o Fluminense também poderia sair com a vitória no tempo normal e não fosse a grande atuação do goleiro João Pedro.\nO primeiro tempo foi de domínio do São Paulo, enquanto o Fluminense foi o dono da partida na etapa final. A decisão por pênaltis acabou sendo justa para o que os dois times apresentaram.\nCom a classificação, o time paulista mantém vivo de conquistar o pentacampeonato do torneio, enquanto o Flu estaciona nos cinco títulos já conquistados.",

    "text": "Anti-Israel demonstration at Harvard University. Time for the local Jewish community and Jewish Harvard alumni to show our strength\nAntisemitism has been on the rise across US college campuses since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war.\nIn recent months, reports of antisemitic incidents at American universities have inundated news channels. Masked marchers advocate for a “free Palestine” that stretches “from the river to the sea” at the expense of Israel’s existence, and claim a right to “resist” Israel “by any means necessary,” including a “globalized intifada.” Jewish students often report being harassed, intimidated, and sometimes outright terrorized by antisemitic mobs who act with impunity.\n“Antisemitism is spreading like wildfire across the campuses in the United States, and it is doing so because the ground was primed,” Alyza Lewin, president and general counsel of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, told The Media Line. “The campus communities were really groomed, and they were groomed to see Zionist Jews as evil. They have been fed for years now a constant diet of anti-Jewish hate.”\nFighting against hate The Brandeis Center is a Washington, DC-based nonprofit, nonpolitical legal group with the goal of advancing human rights and civil rights for Jews. The group has filed numerous legal complaints against US universities for antisemitism, including University of California, Berkeley; University of Southern California; Brooklyn College; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; State University of New York at New Paltz; and the City University of New York system.\nA recent study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Hillel International, and College Plus, an analytics company, found that 73% of the Jewish students they surveyed had experienced or witnessed antisemitism since the beginning of the school year.\nThe ADL recorded 400 incidents of antisemitism on college campuses between October 7 and December 7. During the same period in 2022, 33 antisemitic incidents were reported.\nPro-Palestinian protesters attend ”Flood Brooklyn for Gaza” demonstration, as the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas continues, in New York, US, October 28, 2023.

(credit: CAITLIN OCHS/REUTERS)\nThe elite universities are awash in antisemitism. And it’s not just coming from the students. Recently, Dr. Zareena Grewal, an associate professor of American studies at Yale, posted on social media statements the advocacy group StandWithUS said “promote violence and display an alarming hatred for Jews, Israelis and Zionists” without recourse from Yale.\nUS politicians have taken notice of rising antisemitism on campus, and representatives are working to address the problem.\n“The federal government should leverage the power it has over federal funding to pressure colleges and universities to combat antisemitism,” Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY) told The Media Line. “There should be enhanced enforcement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, and national origin.”\nTorres, who represents the Bronx and spoke at the Washington, DC March for Israel, has been said to represent the future of pro-Israel politicians. His vocal support for Israel has led multiple New York-based pro-Palestinian groups to rally outside his offices over the past two months.\nIt’s time to take accountability “Accountability should come not only from government but also from civil society, which should create a scorecard, rating colleges and universities on campus antisemitism,” Torres said. “A scorecard would create a reputational incentive for colleges and universities to treat the crisis of campus antisemitism with the urgency it deserves.”\nLewin called Torres’ scorecard suggestion “a very creative idea.” “We need to figure out ways to hold the schools accountable and to motivate them to take the steps they can take to really make a difference,” she said.\nThree weeks ago, the US House of Representatives summoned the presidents of three elite universities to speak about antisemitism on college campuses.\nUniversity of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill, Harvard University President Claudine Gay, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth sat before the US House Committee on Education and the Workforce to discuss their efforts to address antisemitism at their universities.\nTheir testimony proved disastrous, with one of the university presidents losing her job in the wake of the hearing.\nMagill resigned from her position as president of Penn a week after the hearing. After she refused to specify whether calling for a genocide of Jews violated the university’s harassment policy, financier Ross Stevens threatened to withdraw a donation to the school of $100 million. Magill stepped down as president but will remain a tenured member of the law school.\nLewin called the presidents’ testimony “clearly disturbing” and said that the testimony served to raise awareness about antisemitism on college campuses.\nMany have demanded that Gay and Kornbluth resign as well, but both have received formal backing from their respective boards.\n“I and the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation entirely support President Kornbluth,” Mark P. Gorenberg, chair of the MIT Corporation, wrote in a statement.\nA separate letter of support for Kornbluth, signed by MIT deans, department heads, and senior faculty leaders, addressed the issue of free speech on campus, distinguishing between “what we can say and what we should say.”\nHarvard’s board also released a statement of support for President Gay following her testimony.\n“Our extensive deliberations affirm our confidence that President Gay is the right leader to help our community heal and to address the very serious societal issues we are facing,” the Harvard Corporation said in a statement.\nRep. Torres said that Gay should resign.\n“When it came to the question of whether [calling for] a genocide of Jews constitutes harassment, I found Claudine Gay’s answer to be so offensive and outrageous as to merit resignation, and I have said so publicly,” Torres said.\nGay’s comments came on the heels of several antisemitic incidents that have taken place at Harvard in the recent past. The Brandeis Center sent a legal warning to Harvard representing the complaints of three Israeli students who claimed that a Harvard professor discriminated against them.\nDays after the October 7 attacks, over 30 Harvard student groups signed a letter that claimed Israel was “entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” Some leaders of the student groups had job offers rescinded as a result of signing the letter.\nHelp is available for students experiencing discrimination. The Brandeis Center has partnered with the ADL, Hillel International, and the Gibson Dunn law firm to launch the Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL). According to Lewin, CALL will provide American Jews on US college campuses “the legal guidance and support they need” to combat university antisemitism. Additionally, CALL aims to assist law firms and lawyers involved in administrative complaints and lawsuits.\nLewin explains that this will “better coordinate with one another to ensure these efforts work in concert, rather than potentially undermining each other.” CALL, accessible at Legal-protection.org, aims to “ensure all students who need it receive the best legal support possible,” Lewin told The Media Line.\nUniversities failing to protect Jewish students on campus can expect legal challenges from Lewin and the Brandeis Center. When university administrators fail to act, even when made aware of clear discrimination, we are left with no choice,” Lewin stated.",

    "text": "8 Picturesque Small Towns In Southern California For A Weekend Retreat You probably know Southern California for its large cities like [Los Angeles](https://www.worldatlas.com/cities/los-angeles-california.html) and smaller but similarly dynamic communities like Malibu. But there are even smaller SoCal haunts worthy of a visit. These little havens from big city blues boast all kinds of colorful attractions, including skiable mountains, Dutch windmills, improbable apple trees, zebras, and a mayor who is a dog. Best of all, they are compact and accessible enough to be explored over a weekend. Here are eight of the most picturesque places for a sojourn in SoCal. Idyllwild-Pine Cove Idyllwild-Pine Cove is a census-designated place comprising three unincorporated communities: Idyllwild, Pine Cove, and Fern Valley. Just over 4,000 people call this area home, while thousands more call it a weekend vacation hotspot. A sub-two-hour drive from Los Angeles lands travelers in this hub of the San Jacinto Mountains, which offers hiking, rock climbing, and sightseeing, especially at Tahquitz Peak and Suicide Rock. But you do not have to scale a mountain to find spectacular sights in Idyllwild-Pine Cove. The community contains Idyllwild Nature Center, The Rustic Theatre and Entertainment Center, and Grand Idyllwild Lodge. If you thought this place could not get any better, its mayor is a golden retriever named Maximus Mighty-Dog Mueller III, the third in a line of pawiticians following Mayor Max II and Mayor Max I. You can pet Max III at community events like Fourth of July parades and Christmas tree-lighting festivities. Being unincorporated, Idyllwild-Pine Cove cannot have an official mayor, so its doggocracy is a cute, lucrative, and now long-running stunt. Topanga If you are looking for a low-key LA, meet Topanga. This 8,500ish-person community is contained in a canyon in Los Angeles County. Though just a quick drive from the big city, Topanga's lush mountainous surroundings protect it from hubbub. In fact, there is only one road in and out. Once you are in, you can explore Topanga State Park, Red Rock Canyon Park, and Tuna Canyon Park, all of which are in the Santa Monica Mountains, plus oceanside Topanga Beach. After winding back to town, you can catch a show at Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an open-air theater founded by a blacklisted [Hollywood](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-city-is-hollywood-in.html) actor, before crashing at Topanga Canyon Inn Bed and Breakfast, a [Mediterranean](https://www.worldatlas.com/geography/mediterranean-countries.html)-style building with Mediterranean-style views. Avalon [Avalon](https://www.worldatlas.com/cities/avalon-california.html), also in Los Angeles County, is even more isolated than Topanga. You can get there only by boat, plane, helicopter, or a marathon swim since Avalon is on [Santa Catalina Island](https://www.worldatlas.com/islands/santa-catalina-island-california.html). But just because it is isolated does not mean it is quiet. Each year over one million people visit Avalon, which has a resident population of roughly 3,500. Tourists and residents alike patronize the Avalon Theatre, Catalina Island Museum, and Catalina Island Conservancy. With a few exceptions, full-sized vehicles are banned on Santa Catalina, so golf carts are a popular alternative. If the golf cart traffic gets a little wild, you can take refuge deeper in the island, such as in Two Harbors, a tiny village containing Harbor Reef Restaurant & Bar and Banning House Lodge, or at one of several scenic seaside campsites. San Simeon If you like beaches, wine, history, elephant seals, and zebras, you are bound to love San Simeon. This 450ish-person village straddles the Pacific coast at the remote halfway point between LA and [San Francisco](https://www.worldatlas.com/cities/san-francisco-california.html), covering rustic beaches primed for swimming, surfing, kayaking, kiteboarding, boating, fishing, and elephant seal viewing. The Piedras Blancas Rookery is, according to [San Simeon's website](https://visitsansimeonca.com/what-to-do/elephant-seals-san-simeon/#:~:text=The%20Piedras%20Blancas%20Rookery%20is,San%20Simeon%20on%20Highway%201.), the \"only elephant seal rookery in the world that is easily accessible, free, and open to the public every day of the year.\" You can go from rookery to winery at Hearst Ranch Winery, which originates from newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, who made San Simeon his kingdom in the early 1900s. Along with the winery, his legacy spans William Randolph Hearst Memorial Beach, Hearst Castle, and the 120-plus zebras that roam his former ranchlands. Descendants of zebras from Hearst's defunct private zoo, they live without human intervention, meaning, aside from a fence around their 83,000-acre home, they are completely wild. You can stay at another Hearst haunt, Hearst Hacienda Lodge, while earning your stripes in San Simeon. Ojai Venture to the quaint and quirky Ventura County community of Ojai. Attractions include Ojai Certified Farmers Market, a Sunday staple of flowers, produce, gourmet food, and artisan goods; Yume Japanese Burger Cafe, a dreamy [Japanese](https://www.worldatlas.com/maps/japan) restaurant specializing in wagyu hamburgers; and Bart's Books, the world's largest outdoor bookstore. Weekenders can choose from a number of Spanish villa-style inns, among which are the Hummingbird Inn, Su Nido Inn, Blue Iguana Inn, and Chantico Inn And Suites. Like much of SoCal, Ojai is surrounded by mountains, so Meher Mount and Hines Peak are a mere hike away. Julian Julian is a scenic, historical community just over an hour's drive from [San Diego](https://www.worldatlas.com/cities/san-diego-california.html). This former [gold rush](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/when-was-the-gold-rush.html) town contains the Julian Pioneer Museum, which displays everything from Indigenous artifacts to mining equipment, and the Julian Gold Rush Hotel, which was built around the turn of the century by pioneering African Americans and is considered the oldest continuously operating hotel in Southern California. Julian's history as an unlikely high-elevation apple producer can be viewed at numerous orchards, whose decades-old trees bear apples that are used in such stores as Julian Pie Company and Apple Alley Bakery. After munching Julian's legendary apple pie, you can see legendary lobos munch at California Wolf Center, which is dedicated to saving the Mexican gray wolf. Big Bear Lake [Big Bear Lake](https://www.worldatlas.com/cities/big-bear-lake-california.html) is for people who dream of skiing in semi-arid SoCal. This San Bernardino County community is home to Big Bear Mountain Resort, which offers skiing, snowboarding, and extraordinary views of the San Bernardino Mountains. For non-skiers or skiers taking a rare break, Big Bear Lake has an Alpine Slide at Magic Mountain, Big Bear Pirate Ship, Mineshaft Coaster, Bear Mountain Golf Course, Big Bear Alpine Zoo, The Bone Yard Bar & Grill, and aquatic activities at the titular lake. Hotels are abundant and range from extravagant, like The Club at Big Bear Village, to rustic, like Eagle's Nest Lodge Bed and Breakfast. Solvang Solvang is commonly called the best small community in SoCal. It is celebrated for its architecture, which stems from its roots as a Danish-American colony. Beginning in the 1940s, Danish American residents decided to construct or remodel buildings in traditional style. Thus, modern Solvang contains the Elverhøj Museum of History & Art, Hans Christian Andersen Park, Svendsgaard's Danish Lodge, and several windmills. \"The Danish Capital of America\" is not lacking for home-country hospitality, either, since it offers treats from Olsen's Danish Village Bakery and tours from Solvang Trolley & Carriage Company. Danish Days, a festival of all things [Denmark](https://www.worldatlas.com/maps/denmark), happens in Solvang each September. From marvelous mountains in Idyllwild-Pine Cove to Danish desserts in Solvang, Southern California's small communities have picturesque attractions ready to be explored. Their compact size and proximity to Los Angeles, San Diego, and other large cities make them well-suited for a weekend trip. One can drive in on Friday and drive out on Sunday, creating a lifetime of memories in three days. There is nothing so-so about small-town SoCal.",

Nun gibt es eine Einigung. Wie sieht sie aus?\nMurr - Im Tarifkonflikt beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat gibt es eine Einigung - es ist zugleich nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: „Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.“\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert. dpa",

    "text": "Arthur Lee & Love Biography Covers Peaks and Valleys: Reviewby [Jeff Burger](https://bestclassicbands.com/author/jeff-burger/) [For a brief period in the mid-1960s in Southern California, Love was the rock band to beat. In John Einarson’s recently updated and reissued book, Forever Changes: The Authorized Biography of Arthur Lee and Love, Jim Morrison is quoted as telling fellow Doors member Ray Manzarek around 1966, “You know, Ray, if we could be as big as Love, man, my life would be complete.” Obviously, the Doors achieved that goal and then some while Love, one of the most talented and influential bands of the 1960s, never enjoyed nationwide commercial success.](https://bestclassicbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Arthur-Lee-Love.jpeg) Einarson’s book explains the reasons for that, the most important of which appears to have been the stubbornness, quirkiness and bad luck of band leader Arthur Lee. He often refused to perform Love’s most popular material, and he didn’t like to tour. He even turned down an offer to appear at the hugely significant Monterey Pop Festival and nixed an invitation to perform at a 1969 New York event because he didn’t want to bother flying east for just one show—a show that turned out to be the Woodstock festival. Then, in 1996, a trio of relatively minor arrests in California led to a 12-year prison sentence, thanks to the state’s three-strikes-and-you’re-out law. Lee did wind up being released from jail after serving slightly less than half of that sentence, after which he toured Europe with a new band, performing Love’s songbook—and especially its masterful third album, [Forever Changes](https://byjeffburger.com/2018/05/08/a-new-opportunity-to-love-love/)—to adoring audiences. Around the same time, though, he was diagnosed with the leukemia that killed him in 2006, at age 61. Einarson’s book vividly details the ups and downs of Lee’s career and the milieu in which he and his band operated. It also offers smart commentary on the albums and singles in their discography and includes lots of insights into the group’s frequently abstruse lyrics. To cite one of many examples, a line in the group’s “Stephanie Knows Who” finds Lee singing, “A my love, B my love, so hard to choose.” Turns out Lee and the group’s Bryan McLean were vying for the love of a woman named Stephanie Buffington. In the song, “A” stands for Arthur and “B” for Bryan. Related: [Behind the scenes with Love’s Johnny Echols](https://bestclassicbands.com/forever-changes-love-johnny-echols-interview-12-13-22/) The book could have benefited from a discography and a more complete index, and it includes somewhat more typos and grammatical errors than one might expect, especially in a second edition. But these are quibbles. The biography is even-handed and exhaustively researched and reveals as much as we’re ever likely to know about the brilliant and enigmatic Arthur Lee and his extraordinary band. [The new edition of Forever Changes: The Authorized Biography of Arthur Lee and Love arrived on Sept. 10, 2024.

    "title": "JD.com Retail Employees to Get a 20% Pay Bump after Founder Calls for Change",
    "text": "BEIJING, December 29 (TMTPost)— JD.com announced a massive increase in wages for its core retail business despite gross margin weighed by ongoing low-pricing strategy.\nAll the staff at JD Retails, a segment contributed abour 86% of overall revenue for the third quarter of this year, will get their pay with an average bump of no less than 20% from the start of 2024, according to a statement late Wednesday. It also said and all the frontliners including those responsible for procurement and sales of products across all categories will have an almost 100% increase in their fixed compensation for a year, effective on January 1, 2024.\nJD Retail workers will get raise from salaries and their performance-based compensation will have an increase without cap, China Securities Journal learned from people close to the company on Friday. According to the state-run newspaper, starting from January 1, 2024, employees at all the online business of JD Retail will see their original performanc-based salary and floating year-end bonus added to the fixed compensation, and enjoy the year-end bonus four times of the monthly salary. In addition, head of the business units will receive additional incentives based on the year-over-year improvement of performance without cap, per the newspaper. Each business group is reported to release their own plans about such performance-based incentives in January.\nThe wage hike is one of the first major moves after JD’s iconic founder Liu Qiangdong urged the change at intranet to highlight his determination to address concerns over the company.\nA JD employee who works for operations management posted an article on December 6 at the company’s private network, listing some of existing problems at JD including the complexity of promotion mechanism, and proposed to plan the pace and intensity of the online platform’s any major promotion in advance, provide more support for merchants as parts of the platform’s ecology and to hold the low-price mindset and implement the strategy to the end.\n“So many problems broke out, which certainly are all due to my poor management, and I blame myself very much. But whatever (the problems are), I will not embrace lying flat, and wish our colleagues will by no means not,” Liu Qiangdong recently commented on the above-mentioned post on December 9. The post gets to the point and the company has to make a change unless it will come to a dead end, Liu said. The founder called for staff to have more patience as it takes time for a organization that has grown into large, bloated and inefficient to change.”JD still has its foundation and I believe we can will definitely bounce out of the bottom,” said Liu.”Any person or company will go through several ups and downs before they become great.”\nLiu Qiangdong’s response came days after Alibaba Group’s co-founder Jack Ma rarely spoke out at the intranet. “I believe All the Alibaba staff are witnessing and hearing, and I firmly believe Alibaba will change and make correction, ” Ma commented on one of commentaries of the post, which is prompted by PDD’s market capitalization gap between Alibaba that narrowed to just US$8 billion on November 28. “Every great company is born in a winter. As the artificial intelligence (AI) era for e-commerce is right at its beginning, it is an opportunity for everyone as well as a challenge,” Ma wrote.\nJD and Alibaba has taken steps to reinforce their competitiveness following Liu and Ma’s urging to revamp. JD released on Wednesday an updated dispute management guideline to add the “refund only” policy, a day after Taobao, the online shopping platform under Alibaba, rolled out a host of new rules including implementation of the same policy. JD will adopt the policy under various cases, such as the buyer and the seller’s failure to tell which side is accountable, seriously poor quality of the goods delivered , delivery of wrong goods. The platform has the right to determine whether to apply for the \"refund only\" or \"returning and refund\" policy based on its multidimensional evaluation for merchants during after-sales services as well as transaction disputes. The updated guideline is just an extension of application for the “refund only” policy since it has already been applicable for JD’s self-operated business since 2014, insiders at the company said. They suggests the latest adjustment mainly affect third party merchants on JD platform.\nThe “refund only” policy, initiated by PDD, is designed to improve shopping experience and reinforce protection for consumers while it also increases cost and risks of merchants. Taobao and JD’s move is the latest response to competitive heat.\nRecent financial results highlighted PDD sales growth outrun major domestic rivals in the quarter ended September 30. PDD posted revenue of RMB68.84 billion (US$9.43 billion) that quarter, exceeding by about 25% more than the average analysts’ estimate. The sales surged 94% from a year earlier, accelerating from the previous quarter’s 66% year-over-year (YoY) increase, and refreshed the record set in the second quarter, increasing around 32% sequentially. JD’s revenue increased 1.7% YoY, better than the analysts’ estimated RMB246.59 billion. But revenue still slowed down from the second quarter with a 7.6% YoY increase.",
