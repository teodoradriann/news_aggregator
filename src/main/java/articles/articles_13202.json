    "text": "The Golden. Like Cortes and the conquistadors who crossed the ocean in search of treasure. Or the American pioneers, obsessed with nugget hunting. Today it seems like a game a new gold rush. The safe haven par excellence, evaluated 60 euros per gram it is a safe investment. Especially in times that see the succession of wars, ranging from Ukraine to the Middle East, inflation that is once again scary and the rise in interest rates that seems unstoppable. Gold sparkles (once again) like the safe haven to shelter during the storm. The price of gold The price increase is caused by various factors, but the main reason is to be found in geopolitical instability which has been affecting the planet for several years. In other words: The gold rush is fueled by fear. A motto often used by analysts goes like this: «The engine of the global [economy](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/economy/) is much more often linked to emotion than to rationality». However, there are also other factors to consider. For example the general increase in public debts, the large amount of liquidity that was generated in response to the 2008 crisis and, finally, the fact that a large part of the [world](https://www.world-today-news.com/category/world/)’s central banks continue to increase their gold reserves. The price of gold has always seemed to show a inverse correlation with interest rates. That is, when the cost of money increases, the demand for gold decreases. As well as its value. Trivially, because other investments guarantee greater profits. Yet today, although rates remain high, the price of gold shows no signs of decreasing. Indeed, in 2024 it is estimated that the price of gold is destined to reach its historic highs. Since it appears almost certain that the rise in interest rates will come to an end. And, on the other hand, it is easy to hypothesize that [international](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/international/) conflicts will not end. The “goldsmith” Turin Thus, gold coins are back in fashion. And the same goes for jewelry and precious stones. As luck would have it, Turin has a highly respectable tradition in this area. The establishment in the city of the Cartier factory. The factory opened its doors at the beginning of 2023 and immediately brought a breath of fresh air to the neighborhood. It also seems that in recent weeks too George Clooney paid a visit to the factory. For further [information](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/information/), read also: A growing sector The companies that deal with gold and jewels in Piedmont are: 1,168 as of June 30, 2023 versus 1,151 as of June 30, 2022 (a growth that interrupted the decline recorded in recent years resulting from cessations of activity but also from concentrations due to progressive acquisitions by consolidated groups). The province of Alessandria confirms itself as queen with its district of Valenza (848 companies, there were 830 in June 2022), followed by Turin with 218 companies (there were 221 last year) which appears to be decidedly detached from all the other provinces. 2023-12-28 19:28:00 #gold #rush #begins #Shelter #storm",

[Hannah Phillips](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/staff/7088384002/hannah-phillips/) WEST PALM BEACH — Federal prosecutors say the wife and brother-in-law of a high-ranking member of Palm Beach County law enforcement [defrauded Medicare out of more than $9 million](/story/news/crime/2022/03/01/another-10-south-florida-men-face-health-care-fraud-charges-case-swells-67-m/9319845002/). If convicted, they could spend up to 55 years in federal prison. Ted Albin and Erin Foley, South Florida twins and owners of a medical billing company, are accused of conspiring with clients to bill insurers for medical equipment their patients didn't need. In addition to the multimillion dollar payout from insurers, investigators say the twins earned kickbacks for helping others commit fraud, too. Foley's husband, Randy Foley, leads the Behavioral Services Division at the [Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office](/story/opinion/editorials/2023/12/15/palm-beach-county-sheriffs-son-in-law-contract-reeks-of-nepotism/71881049007/). He was not named in the 14-page indictment and has not been charged with a crime. His wife and brother-and-law were indicted in December after investigators identified the siblings' West Palm Beach company, Grapevine Professional Services Inc., as one of several across the country believed to have exploited the federal insurance program. “Medicare is a valuable taxpayer-funded program, designed to provide affordable health care to people over 65 or with disabilities,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in the wake of their arrest. “Not to line the pockets of those who would enrich themselves through fraud.\" 'Spine crime': [Patients say Lake Worth-area back doctor did 'fake surgeries,' left them in pain](/story/news/crime/2021/11/08/patients-sue-lake-worth-area-doctor-over-fake-spinal-fusion-surgeries/6290149001/) Prosecutors: South Florida twins profited off illegitimate prescriptions Investigators say a network of medical equipment companies provided the twins with sham prescriptions for durable medical equipment, or DME, between 2018 and 2021. DME includes braces, wheelchairs, oxygen equipment and other medical supplies. The indictment does not name the people who wrote the bogus prescriptions but said Albin and Foley knew of their illegitimate origins and used them to bill insurance companies anyway. The twins owned several medical equipment companies themselves and are accused of funneling their own illegally purchased prescriptions into Grapevine's mix as well. Investigators believe the pair also charged a fee to connect associates who wanted in on the scam with people willing to sign off on the phony prescriptions. Foley, 46, of Loxahatchee and Albin, 46, of Stuart were charged in the Southern District of New York with conspiring to commit, and actually committing, health care fraud and wire fraud, as well as conspiring to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Foley's court-appointed defense attorney, Jeffrey Pittell, declined to comment on the allegations Thursday. Albin's attorney, Sean Maher, did not immediately return requests for comment. Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Teri Barbera said Capt. Randy Foley is a \"highly respected member of PBSO and is not implicated in these yet-to-be proven allegations.\" She declined to comment further.

    "text": "July 1, 1931 — July 14, 2025\nOur beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and aunt, has returned to her Heavenly parents. Elva JoAnn Allphin Gifford passed away peacefully in her sleep at her home on July 14, 2025.\nMom was born in Malad, Idaho, on July 1, 1931, to James H. and Elva Price Williams. She was the baby of the family of two sisters and three brothers. She grew up on the family ranch in Gwenford, driving the hay tractor, and riding her horse. She was her dad’s “Pet,” as he called her. She was a rodeo queen and excelled at barrel racing.\nAfter graduating from Malad High School, she visited her sister in Lovell, Wyoming, where she met Reuben Gene Allphin, her eternal sweetheart. Two months later they were married in the Idaho Falls Temple on Aug. 12, 1949. In a letter JoAnn’s mother wrote to Gene, she said, “You know she is a spoiled baby, so you will have to be patient with her and I am sure she will make you a good wife. We love her very much and hope you will always love and cherish her.” JoAnn and Gene did love and cherish each other.\nThey lived in Lovell, Wyoming; Bozeman, Montana; Brigham City and Ogden, Utah, before they settled in Washington Terrace, Utah, where they raised their family of six children. Because of Gene’s poor health, they moved to Southern Utah in 1978. They built a home in Santa Clara where JoAnn has lived for the last 46 years. Gene passed away in September 1985 at age 58.\nJoAnn married Leon Gifford in November 1986. He was a wonderful husband to JoAnn, and a beloved 2nd father and grandfather to all the family.\nAs a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, JoAnn held many callings, but the one she cherished the most was serving with Leon for 13 years in the St. George Temple. They also served two missions: one in the Laie Hawaii Temple, and later served in the Japan Fukuoka Mission Office.\nJoAnn was preceded in death by her parents, siblings, and husbands, Gene and Leon. One great-granddaughter, Nova Judkins, also passed away as an infant.\nMom leaves behind a large posterity from her children: Michael Gene (Jolene) Allphin; Mark W. (Shauna) Allphin; Janet (Don) Judkins; Shanna (Jim) Dunyon; Sandy (Rick) Nelson; and Lisa (Tom) Gubler. Mom’s legacy through these children have given her 33 grandchildren, 121 great-grandchildren, and 30 great-great grandchildren.\nA viewing and visitation for friends and family will be held at the McArthur Funeral Home, 160 W. 700 South, St. George, Utah, on Saturday, July 19, 2025, from 5-7 p.m.\nA funeral will be held in Washington Terrace, Ogden, Utah, on Monday, July 21, 2025, at 11 a.m., preceded by a viewing from 9-10:30 a.m. at the church meetinghouse located at 25 E. 5350 South, Washington Terrace, Utah.\nInterment will directly follow the funeral at Washington Heights Memorial Park, 4500 Washington Blvd., Ogden, Utah.\nThe family is grateful for the many personnel at Enhabit Home Health who have been such amazing caregivers as well as friends of our mother. Jake from Lincare also became a special friend as he visited every week. We are extremely grateful for Ana Velia Poston who has been her special companion and live-in caregiver for the last five years.\nWe’d like to thank McArthur Funeral Home for the tender care and personal attention given to our mother and family.\nArrangements are under the direction of McArthur Funeral Home and Cremation Center, 160 West 700 South, St. George, 435-652-2844. Family and friends are invited to sign JoAnn's online guest book.",

    "text": "We all know what happens when we assume. Turns out that saying rings true for the folks who thought they understood the nature of the Pompeii residents killed in 79 C.E. after Mt. Vesuvius erupted and buried, then preserved their bodies in ash. The conventional wisdom held that Pompeii’s residents were wealthy Romans — either on holiday or enjoying their second home. That notion appears to be very, very wrong, according to a [study](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01361-7) in Current Biology. DNA Shows Diverse Backgrounds Researchers extracted and analyzed DNA from bone fragments of 14 Vesuvius victims’ skeletons. The genetic data showed that, rather than all originating in one part of Italy, they had diverse genomic backgrounds indicating that they hailed from several areas of the Eastern Mediterranean. The genomic data, combined with the location and positions of the victims, also challenged our conceptions of traditional gender and family roles. “The scientific data we provide do not always align with common assumptions,” [David Reich](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/), a Harvard University researcher, and an author of the study, [said in a press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1063333). “For instance, one notable example is the discovery that an adult wearing a golden bracelet and holding a child, traditionally interpreted as a mother and child, were an unrelated adult male and child. Similarly, a pair of individuals thought to be sisters, or mother and daughter, were found to include at least one genetic male.” Read More: [Two Skeletons Leave Behind Clues to Pompeii's Demise](/the-sciences/two-skeletons-leave-behind-clues-to-pompeiis-demise) Understanding Ancient Societies The researchers’ initial goal wasn’t to shift paradigms, but simply to gain as much understanding as they could about the victims’ relationships with each other, their gender, and their ancestry. Combining genetics with historical information and archeological evidence allows researchers to paint both a more complete and more accurate picture, and demonstrates how teamwork from different disciplines can unearth rich, complex stories. “Our findings have significant implications for the interpretation of archaeological data and the understanding of ancient societies,” co-author Alissa Mittnik, also from Harvard University, said in a press release. “They highlight the importance of integrating genetic data with archaeological and historical information to avoid misinterpretations based on modern assumptions.” Read More: [The City Under Pompeii's Ashes, and 4 Other Sites That Civilizations Built Over](/planet-earth/the-city-under-pompeiis-ashes-and-4-other-sites-that-civilizations-built) Article Sources Our writers at[ Discovermagazine.com](http://discovermagazine.com/) use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

    "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER: The nice stretch continues HAZARD, Ky. (WYMT) - After seeing another picture perfect day across Eastern KY, the stretch of nice weather continues as we head into the weekend. YOUR FIRST ALERT Your First Alert has everything lit up in green meaning conditions are great for the next 24 hours. DISCUSSION This forecast discussion can pretty much start like how it started the past few days where we had another picture-perfect fall day across Eastern Kentucky with highs in the upper 60s and low 70s. This will pave the way for clear skies again for the overnight hours with lows dropping into the low to mid 40s. Some places could drop into the upper 30s for overnight lows. The same tune will play again for Friday until we get into the weekend. This weekend will provide a little *gasp* of Summer with highs going back into the mid to upper 70s with lots of sunshine. Some places could even make it into the low 80s Get out and enjoy the nice weather because after Sunday, we are talking about cooler air. We will be keeping an eye on another cold front that will push through Eastern KY as we head into Sunday evening and going into Monday Morning. This isn’t just a weak front that will drop the temperature a couple of degrees and call it good. This one means business as we go from highs in the mid to upper 70s for this upcoming weekend, to highs in the upper 50s and low 60s. Overnight lows could easily dip into the upper 30s.
