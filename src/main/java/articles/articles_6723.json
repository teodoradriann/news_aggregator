    "text": "Tunisia’s Doctor Strike: A Harbinger of Healthcare System Strain Across North Africa? A staggering 80% of young Tunisian doctors are now on strike, a dramatic escalation of long-simmering frustrations over working conditions, legal protections, and the future of the nation’s healthcare system. While the immediate cause is a dispute over contractual obligations and legal recourse for medical errors, this unrest signals a deeper, regional vulnerability: the growing pressure on public healthcare infrastructure in North Africa, coupled with a brain drain of skilled medical professionals. This isn’t simply a Tunisian crisis; it’s a warning.\nThe Roots of the Crisis: Beyond Contractual Disputes The current strike, initiated by young doctors, stems from a lack of clear legal frameworks protecting them from accusations of negligence, even in cases of demonstrably limited resources or systemic failures. Reports indicate a climate of fear, where doctors are hesitant to take on challenging cases due to the potential for legal repercussions. This is exacerbated by a system of short-term contracts – known as ‘ contrats 447 ’ – that offer limited job security and inadequate compensation, particularly when compared to opportunities available in Europe. The Tunisian government, while acknowledging the need for reform, has been slow to implement concrete changes, fueling the escalating tensions.\nThe Role of Political Instability Tunisia’s recent political instability has undoubtedly contributed to the current situation. A fractured political landscape and shifting priorities have hampered effective governance and long-term planning within the healthcare sector. President Saied’s calls for a new legal framework are a positive step, but the speed and efficacy of its implementation remain uncertain. The strike is, in part, a symptom of a broader crisis of confidence in the government’s ability to address the fundamental needs of its citizens.\nA Regional Trend: Healthcare Under Pressure The challenges facing Tunisian doctors are not unique. Across North Africa, healthcare systems are struggling to cope with growing populations, limited funding, and an increasing burden of chronic diseases. Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt all face similar issues of understaffing, inadequate infrastructure, and a growing exodus of medical professionals seeking better opportunities abroad. This brain drain is particularly concerning, as it further weakens already fragile healthcare systems.\nThe Rise of Medical Tourism – A Double-Edged Sword While medical tourism offers a potential revenue stream for North African countries, it also places additional strain on already stretched resources. Attracting international patients requires investment in specialized facilities and highly skilled personnel, diverting resources from the needs of the local population. Furthermore, the focus on lucrative procedures for foreign patients can exacerbate inequalities in access to healthcare.\nThe Future of Healthcare in North Africa: Towards Resilience Addressing the current crisis requires a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, governments must prioritize investment in healthcare infrastructure and workforce development. This includes increasing salaries, improving working conditions, and providing opportunities for continuous professional development. Secondly, a clear and equitable legal framework is essential to protect healthcare professionals from undue legal risks. Finally, regional cooperation is crucial to address the shared challenges of brain drain and resource scarcity.\nHowever, the most significant shift will likely be the increasing adoption of telehealth and digital health solutions. These technologies can help to bridge the gap in access to care, particularly in remote and underserved areas. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to assist doctors with diagnosis and treatment planning, reducing their workload and improving patient outcomes. The successful integration of these technologies will require significant investment in digital infrastructure and training, but the potential benefits are immense.\nCountry Doctor-to-Patient Ratio (approx.) Healthcare Spending (% of GDP) Tunisia 1:1,750 6.2% Morocco 1:2,000 5.8% Algeria 1:1,500 7.1% Egypt 1:600 3.7% Frequently Asked Questions About the Tunisian Doctor Strike What are the long-term consequences of the doctor strike in Tunisia? The long-term consequences could include a further deterioration of the healthcare system, increased emigration of medical professionals, and a decline in public health outcomes. Without swift and decisive action, Tunisia risks a full-blown healthcare crisis.\nHow will the adoption of telehealth impact healthcare access in North Africa? Telehealth has the potential to significantly improve access to care, particularly in rural areas where there is a shortage of doctors. It can also reduce the burden on hospitals and clinics, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.\nWhat role can international organizations play in supporting healthcare systems in North Africa? International organizations can provide financial assistance, technical expertise, and training programs to help strengthen healthcare systems in North Africa. They can also facilitate regional cooperation and knowledge sharing.\nIs this strike likely to spread to other countries in the region? The potential for spillover is high. Similar grievances exist in other North African countries, and the Tunisian strike could embolden doctors in those nations to demand similar reforms. The situation warrants close monitoring.\nThe unfolding situation in Tunisia is a stark reminder of the fragility of healthcare systems in North Africa. Addressing the underlying issues requires a commitment to long-term investment, systemic reform, and regional cooperation. The future of healthcare in the region depends on it.

    "text": "Berlín, 6 mar (EFE).- La extensión diaria del hielo marino mundial alcanzó un nuevo mínimo histórico a principios de febrero y se mantuvo por debajo del récord anterior de febrero de 2023 durante el resto del mes, que fue además el tercer febrero más cálido a nivel global, según el Servicio de Cambio Climático Copernicus (C3S).\nEl componente de monitoreo del clima del programa espacial de la Unión Europea (UE) indicó en su boletín mensual que el hielo marino del Ártico alcanzó su extensión mensual más baja en febrero, al situarse un 8 % por debajo de la media.\nEs el tercer mes consecutivo en el que la extensión del hielo marino marca un récord para el mes correspondiente.\nCopernicus recuerda sin embargo que el nuevo mínimo registrado en el Ártico en febrero no es un mínimo histórico, ya que el hielo marino del Ártico se aproxima actualmente a su extensión máxima anual, que suele producirse en marzo.\nA su vez, el hielo marino antártico alcanzó su cuarta extensión mensual más baja en febrero al estar un 26 % por debajo de la media.\nLa extensión diaria de hielo marino podría haber alcanzado su mínimo anual hacia finales de mes.\nDe confirmarse, sería el segundo mínimo más bajo registrado por satélite, un dato que solo será posible confirmar más adelante durante este mes.\nA su vez, Copernicus señaló que el mes pasado fue el tercer febrero más cálido a nivel mundial, con una temperatura media del aire en superficie de 13,36 °C, 0,63 °C por encima de la media de 1991-2020 para febrero, y solo ligeramente más cálido, en 0,03 °C, que el cuarto más cálido de 2020.\nFebrero también se situó 1,59 °C por encima de la media estimada de 1850-1900 utilizada para definir el nivel preindustrial.\nFue el decimonoveno mes de los últimos 20 meses en el que la temperatura media mundial del aire en superficie superó en más de 1,5 °C la media de 1850-1900, advirtió el organismo con sede en la ciudad alemana de Bonn.\nPor su parte, la temperatura media mundial del invierno boreal de 2025 (de diciembre de 2024 a febrero de 2025) fue la segunda más alta registrada, con 0,71 °C por encima de la media de 1991-2020 para estos tres meses.\nSe situó solamente 0,05 °C por debajo del récord establecido para el invierno boreal de 2024.\nEl periodo de 12 meses comprendido entre marzo de 2024 y febrero de 2025 fue a su vez 0,71 °C superior a la media de 1991-2020 y 1,59 °C superior al nivel preindustrial.\nSegún Samantha Burgess, del Centro Europeo de Previsiones Meteorológicas a Plazo Medio (CEPMPM), febrero de 2025 continúa la racha de temperaturas récord o casi récord observada a lo largo de los dos últimos años.\n\"Una de las consecuencias de un mundo más cálido es el derretimiento del hielo marino, y el récord o casi récord de cobertura de hielo marino en ambos polos ha llevado la cobertura global de hielo marino a un mínimo histórico\", señaló.

[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Berlin | Updated: 24-12-2023 03:32 IST | Created: 24-12-2023 03:32 IST - Country: - Germany German police said on Saturday they were heightening security at Cologne Cathedral following indications of an attack planned for New Year's Eve, a week after the interior minister warned of the rising threat of Islamist violence. The police said in a statement they would use tracker dogs to check the cathedral after evening mass and then close it off. On Sunday, Christmas Eve, they would carry out a security check on all visitors whom they recommended to get to services early. Police said they could not elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation. German newspaper Bild earlier reported that security authorities in Austria, Germany and Spain had received indications that an Islamist group wants to carry out attacks during the Christmas and New Year festivities. Austrian police said in a statement they were heightening security on churches and Christmas markets given a heightened state of alert. \"Given that terrorist actors throughout Europe are calling for attacks on Christian events, especially around Dec. 24, the security authorities have taken the corresponding protection measures in public spaces,\" the police said.

    "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas — [Beaumont](https://www.beaumonttexas.gov/) city leaders are working to provide a shelter to anyone who needs it as Southeast Texas braces for the winter weather. Beaumont is partnering with the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, Henry's Place and Some Other Place to provide shelters so people can have protection from the dangerous temperatures coming soon. The city will also be using city buses as mobile warming shelters. City officials say that thanks to lessons learned along with coordination between the city and these organizations, they stand ready to assist those in need. \"We encourage folks who need a hot meal and a warm bed to come to our shelter on McFadden Street,\" said Commanding Officer of the Salvation Army in Jefferson County Major Ken Fagan. Major Fagan says their shelter will be ready to warm, feed and house anyone who needs it. This includes overnight as the frigid temperatures sweep in. \"We have sixty beds, but when we have the severe weather we'll open it up and we'll take as many folks as we can,\" Major Fagan said. Additionally, the Salvation Army and the American Red Cross will help staff the emergency shelters at Some Other Place and Henry's Place with volunteers. \"They kinda come in knowing the game plan and try to make it as comfortable as possible for everybody,\" said Some Other Place Executive Director Christopher Robertson. For those who don't wish to use the shelters there's a second option, according to Robertson. City buses will be operating as overnight transportation and warming stations throughout Beaumont. \"People are pretty attached to their camps, some of them. With Mayor West allowing the city buses to run as warming stations they may just end up parking them outside one of the camps if people decide to stay there,\" Robertson said. These mobile warming stations are especially helpful for those experiencing homelessness. \"We're pretty familiar with where most of the homeless stay,\" said Beaumont Mayor Roy West. \"People can stay on the bus or they can be taken to the shelter and be shuttled back and forth and there will be some of both.\" Community outreach and aiding those experiencing homelessness during the freeze is just as important as the shelters, according to West. \"This is the community helping the community,\" he said.",

    "title": "'It starts from the top': Misogyny in the Cambridge Union",
    "text": "‘It starts from the top’: Misogyny in the Cambridge Union\nThe women of the Union have their say about the female experience in the male-dominated society\n“Women don’t want to spend precious time feeling like shit,” says one anonymous female member of the Cambridge Union when asked why more women don’t get involved. The self-proclaimed ‘world’s oldest debating society’ is no stranger to criticisms of this kind: another committee member tells me that she understands why the reputation of the Union is “elitist, male and privately educated\".\nThe Union only opened its doors to female students as recently as the 1960s, and has since found it difficult to make up for lost time, with many of my interviewees complaining that they feel they are treated differently to their male counterparts.\nNeha Pauly, the Union’s president elect for Easter term, will be the society's first female president since Michaelmas 2022. She recognises that women find it more difficult to “stand up for themselves” due to fears of being labelled “‘nasty’ or ‘arrogant’”.\n\"Ultimately it is something that has to come from the women in the room\"\nEven when women do manage to break into the society, they are not granted equal status, according to Equalities Officer Elect Jess Spearman. Jess tells me that the role of Equalities Officer is a “safe seat” for women, explaining that “no matter what there’ll be one woman on standing [committee] because a woman will be equalities.”\nHowever, she also tells me that it is “a shame” the budget for this role is lower than that of Speakers and Debates Officers. “I would’ve found it difficult to say I had the experience for a role like Speakers or Debates,” she tells me, whereas men don’t feel they “necessarily need that experience, they can say ‘I haven’t done this, but vote for me anyway’.”\nBut I am assured that there are people within the Union working hard to open doors previously closed to women. Esha Patel, the Union’s communications officer designate, is confident that initiatives such as “welfare hours, [and] hosting debates, panels and speakers that address the specific issues women face,” are having a hugely positive impact on how safe and valued the society’s female members feel. This attitude is reflected by statements from Alex Horan, who has previously filled the roles of welfare officer and secretary. For Alex, issues around inclusion are a natural consequence of living in a patriarchal society, and she believes that representation “is ultimately something that has to come from the women in the room [having the confidence] to speak.”\nAt times, my interviewees were outright at odds with one another. On whether or not complaints are taken seriously by the Union, Lauren Tucker, secretary for Lent 2024, says that “people will speak out about it and condemn a person for acting like that. So, [...] it is never accepted and is always rebuked.” However, when commenting on the same issue, another member describes feeling like her opinions weren’t welcomed by her male peers, and reports struggling “to speak up when you know it’ll fall on deaf ears.”\nThe latter student (who has requested to remain anonymous) goes on to slam the Union’s lack of a formal complaints process, alleging that the society “has no way of dealing with misconduct unless it’s actually illegal. There are no bullying or harassment policies, or any impartial parties who can investigate these matters.”\n\"There are no bullying or harassment policies\"\nThe Union has a lot of work to do with regard to ensuring the safety of its female members, Louise (not her real name) agrees. She acknowledges that the bar staff at the Union are trained to recognise Ask for Angela, and informs me that there are anti-spiking drinks covers available, but thinks that “they’re not promoted enough for people to know about them.”\nLouise goes on to say that she has been told by higher-ups at the Union that the lack of promotion of anti-spiking measures is a deliberate choice to avoid bad publicity, and tells me that she heard this justified by fears that “if they advertise that they have anti-spiking drinks covers, it will make people think that spiking is something that happens there.”\nOn other occasions, though, the view of my interviewees is unanimous. Every woman I interviewed explicitly stated, or at least alluded to, experiences of slut-shaming in the Union and beyond. Alex tells me that people within the society, spurred on by other public student forums, accused her of “sleeping with half the committee in order to get places,” a sentiment echoed by several other anonymous interviewees.\nThe Union has come under fire in the past for inviting inflammatory speakers, such as gender critical feminist\nKathleen Stock, and anti-abortion political commentator Ben Shapiro. I was curious to know what the women at the centre of the Union thought about how these invitations coincide with its commitment to inclusivity.\nFor Neha, it’s all about balance: she emphasises her team’s dedication to creating a varied term card, with a “broad range of speakers.” She points to LGBTQ+ rights activists Sandi Toksvig and India Willoughby, who “spoke about her experiences being a trans woman in Britain,” as examples of invitees who counteract Ben Shapiro’s presence.\n\"It'll take a culture shift\"\nEqualities Officer for Lent term, Anoushka Kale, agrees. She expresses that she understands why women “might feel like ‘this place is not for me’ if someone who has made overtly misogynistic comments speaks at the Union,” but concurs that this can be avoided by also inviting speakers who empower and uplift women. Anoushka voices her disappointment that there is “disproportionate attention given to certain names.”\nAlex believes that inviting potentially inflammatory speakers is not only compatible with the goal of representation, but is in fact essential for it: “There are men with the mindsets of Shapiro and Peterson existing alongside us every single day [...] Acting like they do not exist is reckless.”\nWhile these students see encouraging debate as the key to a more balanced Union, one former committee member told me that “it’ll take a culture shift” to address deeper inequalities. Such problems “start from the top,” she says, in a society which enables “blatant misogynists [to sit] in the chair,” and where things are “[let] slide because the person is your boss or your friend”.\nA spokesperson for the Union told Varsity: \"Misogyny has no place in our society,\" though they \"acknowledge that the Union has historically been a male dominated space, and are committed to supporting women's participation\". On the claims that their bullying and harassment policies aren't tight enough, the Union commented: \"We have a clear policy for dealing with formal complaints outlined in the code of conduct laws of our constitution; this includes the provision that claims can be investigated by our independent Review Committee.\"\nThey continued: \"We are an accredited Purple Flag venue and follow the Cambridge BID guidelines on spiking [...] Drink spiking covers are available from all bar staff, as advertised on posters throughout the building.\"\nSupport Varsity\nVarsity is the independent newspaper for the University of Cambridge, established in its current form in 1947.

Credits: Video - Newshub/CBS News; Image - Getty Images\nThe White House Correspondents' Association said on Thursday CNN has rejected multiple requests to include White House pool reporters inside the studio during the first presidential debate between incumbent Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump.\nThe press pool, made up of representatives of major news organizations, accompanies the president on foreign and domestic trips and normally has access to any event where he speaks or appears in public, with the goal of keeping the U.S. public informed.\nWatch the debate from 1pm today NZT live on Newshub.co.nz\nMore from Newshub\nWhy tomorrow's Biden vs Trump debate may be the most fateful in US history\nUS election poll: Who is trumping who? It is extremely rare for them to be barred from an event in the United States.\n\"WHCA is deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio,\" Kelly O'Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in a statement.\n\"The pool is there for the 'what ifs?' in a world where the unexpected does happen,\" she said, and to provide \"context and insight by direct observation and not through the lens of the television production.\"\nThese reporters are there to see what is said and done when the microphones and cameras are off, and provide independent observation, she wrote, with duties \"separate from the production of the debate as a news event.\"\nO'Donnel said both the Biden and Trump campaign agreed to the WHCA's request.\nCNN has only agreed to allow one White House print pool reporter to enter the studio during a commercial break to \"briefly observe the setting.\"\nThe network will also allow still photographers from other outlets to cover the candidates inside the studio and will provide a television feed of the debate to other networks.\nCNN has put in place many other rules for the first showdown including two commercial breaks, no props and muted microphones except when the candidates are recognized to speak. The network did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"Precedent matters for future debates,\" O'Donnel said, alluding to Biden and Trump's face off again in September.\nThe National Association of Black Journalists has also asked CNN to accredit reporters from local Black-owned news organizations, after none of Atlanta's Black news groups got credentials to be on-site for the debate.",

    "text": "Ucrania dice que bajas rusas, entre muertos y heridos, han superado el millón desde 2022\nKiev, 12 jun (EFE).- El ministro de Asuntos Exteriores ucraniano, Andrí Sibiga, afirmó este jueves que el número de bajas rusas ha superado el millón, entre muertos y heridos, en los casi tres años y medio desde que empezó la guerra en febrero de 2022.\n«Un millón perdido para nada: Rusia no ha alcanzado ni uno solo de los objetivos estratégicos de sus objetivos a gran escala. Y no lo hará», aseguró Sibiga en la red social X.\nEl ministro subrayó que Ucrania no comenzó la guerra y quiere «más que nadie» que termine, pero que Rusia está obstaculizando todos los intentos para llegar a una solución negociada del conflicto, rechazando la propuesta de Kiev de un alto el fuego y de una reunión a nivel de presidentes.\n«Hay que incrementar la presión sobre el agresor», reclamó.\nSegún las cifras ucranianas, a día de hoy las bajas personales de Moscú ascienden a 1.000.340 efectivos, mientras que Rusia ha perdido también 10.933 tanques, 416 aviones de combate, 28 barcos de guerra y un submarino.\nAdemás, Kiev contabilizó 22.786 vehículos de transporte de tropas, 29.063 sistemas de artillería, 40.435 drones de nivel operativo-táctico y 3.337 misiles de crucero destruidos.

    "text": "USA und China: Ansehen beschädigt - und der Tourismus leidet\nUS-Präsident Trump wird seinem Land Experten zufolge einen Rückgang der Touristenzahlen einbringen. Bisher allerdings muss Großmacht-Rivale China im Reiseverkehr größere Einbußen hinnehmen.\nMünchen/Peking - Im globalen Reiseverkehr haben Krisen und Konflikte der vergangenen Jahre China bislang mehr geschadet als den USA. Die beiden großen deutschen Flughäfen Frankfurt und München melden auch nach dem Amtsantritt von US-Präsident Donald Trump in diesem Jahr bisher einen Anstieg der Passagierzahlen auf den US-Routen, im China-Verkehr hingegen einen Rückgang. Und im direkten Vergleich der jeweiligen weltweiten Besucherzahlen haben die Vereinigten Staaten China seit 2019 überholt.\nFachwelt erwartet Trump-Krise im US-Tourismus\nDer Münchner Flughafen zählte von Januar bis Mai knapp 1,2 Millionen Passagiere im Flugverkehr mit den USA – fast 37.000 mehr als ein Jahr zuvor. Auch in Frankfurt legten die Fluggastzahlen in den ersten vier Monaten – noch ohne Mai – um 7.600 auf 944.300 zu. Das deutet bisher nicht auf einen riesigen Trump-Effekt. Allerdings ist diesen Daten nicht zu entnehmen, ob die Flieger mehrheitlich mit US-Bürgern oder Europäern besetzt waren. Die Zahlen beinhalten sowohl abfliegende als auch ankommende Passagiere.\nDass Trumps zweite Amtszeit dem US-Tourismus schaden wird, ist Konsens in der Fachwelt: Nach Schätzung des in London ansässigen Welttourismusverband WTTC und des Beratungsinstituts Oxford Economics kommen auf die USA in diesem Jahr Einnahmeverluste von über zwölf Milliarden Dollar zu, weil Ausländer fernbleiben. Der „Spiegel“ widmete der Trump-bedingten Reisekrise die Titelgeschichte seiner jüngsten Ausgabe.\nChina-Tourismus: Pandemie wirkt nach, Ukraine-Krieg schadet\nAuf den China-Flugrouten von und nach München und Frankfurt sind die Passagierzahlen in diesem Jahr bereits geschrumpft: um 1.300 auf knapp 203.000 Passagiere während der ersten fünf Monate in München. In den ersten vier Monaten in Frankfurt waren es 180.300 Fluggäste, die nach China flogen oder von dort ankamen, 27.000 weniger als ein Jahr zuvor. Ein quasi identisches Bild zeigt sich auch beim längerfristigen Vergleich der Jahre 2019 und 2024: Gesunkene Passagierzahlen nach und aus China, im Saldo höhere im US-Flugverkehr.\nWoran liegt das? „Die Erreichbarkeit Chinas hat sich erheblich verändert“, sagt Dennis Utzerath, Tourismusfachmann bei der internationalen Unternehmensberatung BCG in Köln. In der Corona-Pandemie wurde das Flugangebot sehr stark zusammengestrichen.\nUnd wegen des Ukraine-Kriegs umfliegen europäische Fluggesellschaften seit 2022 den russischen Luftraum auf teuren Umwegen, chinesische nicht. „Für europäische Fluggesellschaften ist es dadurch erheblich schwieriger geworden, gegen chinesische Airlines wettbewerbsfähig zu sein“, sagt Utzerath. Mehrere europäische Fluggesellschaften – darunter die Lufthansa und British Airways – setzten Verbindungen nach China aus.\nReiseveranstalter sehen wieder steigendes Interesse an China\n„Die immer noch schwachen Fluggastzahlen aus Deutschland Richtung China lassen erstaunlicherweise keinen Rückschluss auf die tatsächliche touristische Nachfrage für China zu“, sagt Holger Baldus, Sicherheitsmanager beim Münchner Reiseanbieter Studiosus. Hintergrund der Fluggastzahlen seien die Streckeneinstellungen europäischer Carrier Richtung China. Der Reiseanbieter sieht sogar ein erstaunliches Wiedererstarken des China-Tourismus aus Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, nach Worten des Managers „derzeit von der knappen Verfügbarkeit an Flugsitzen noch gezügelt“.\nAuch der größte deutsche Reiseveranstalter Tui berichtet, dass das Interesse an China wachse – „aber natürlich von einer recht übersichtlichen Ausgangsbasis“, wie ein Sprecher des Unternehmens sagt.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon länger\nOffenkundig ist jedoch, dass China seit der Corona-Pandemie international an Attraktivität verloren hat. Reisten 2019 nach offiziellen Zahlen noch knapp 96,6 Millionen Ausländer in die Volksrepublik, waren es 2024 nur noch rund 64,9 Millionen – ein Rückgang von etwa ein Drittel. Der Reiseverkehr in die USA hat sich nach dem Ende der Pandemie deutlich schneller erholt: 2019 zählten die Vereinigten Staaten 79,3 Millionen Besucher, weniger als die Volksrepublik. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 72,3 Millionen – mehr als in China.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon erheblich länger als das der USA. Welchen Effekt die Berichterstattung – etwa über staatliche Überwachung und Schnüffelei, brachiale Corona-Lockdowns, Umweltverschmutzung oder Kriegsdrohungen gegen Taiwan – hatte und hat, lässt sich nicht bemessen.\nTourismus lebt von „positiven Bildern im Kopf“\n„Das Thema Image spielt beim Thema China sicher eine Rolle“, sagt Unternehmensberater Utzerath. Schlechte Publicity hinterlasse immer Spuren. „Und das liegt weniger daran, dass ein Land „unten durch“ wäre, sondern dass der Fluss an schönen Erfahrungen, positiven Reiseberichten und Eindrücken abreißt.“ Damit verlagere sich das Interesse. „Ich würde dem keine übermäßige Dramatik beimessen, aber das zeigt, was für ein volatiles Geschäft Tourismus ist. Die Branche lebt von Schlagzeilen und positiven Bildern im Kopf.“\nDieselbe Volatilität gilt auch für die USA: „Es ist im Moment nicht so, dass viele Schlagzeilen dafür sprechen, ausgerechnet jetzt in die USA zu reisen, wenn man letztes Jahr nicht dort war“, sagt Utzerath. Auf der anderen Seite ist der Dollar-Wechselkurs derzeit für Europäer durchaus günstig.\nChina braucht Touristen als Stütze einer schwachen Konjunktur\nAnders als die US-Regierung will Peking ausdrücklich mehr Reisende ins Land locken. Mittlerweile hat die chinesische Regierung ihre komplizierte und teure Visapolitik gelockert. Deutsche brauchen für Geschäfts- oder Tourismusreisen kein Visum mehr. Wer einreist, darf mittlerweile 30 Tage bleiben. Diese Regelung gilt auch für zahlreiche andere europäische Länder.\nAuch die Zugänge zum digitalen Bezahlsystem Chinas sind durch übersetzte Apps und Akzeptanz ausländischer Kreditkarten einfacher geworden. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres bezifferten die Behörden die Einreisen von Ausländern auf etwa 17,4 Millionen – im Jahresvergleich ein Zuwachs um etwas mehr als ein Drittel.\nPeking hofft, dass der Tourismus auch der heimischen Wirtschaft unter die Arme greift. Die schwache Nachfrage und eingetrübte Konsumlaune, die der Wirtschaftsleistung zusetzen, will China auch mit mehr Inlandstourismus wieder ankurbeln. Neue Angebote – etwa speziell für Senioren ausgelegte Zugreisen mit Krankenversorgung und Pflege an Bord – sollen auch die ältere Bevölkerung zu größerem Konsum bewegen. dpa",
