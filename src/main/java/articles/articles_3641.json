    "text": "Since Steve Strathmann was hired as Bishop Fenwick High School’s president six months ago, he has added a chief operations officer and now a principal.The Catholic school, located on Ohio 122 in Warren County, recently announced the hiring of Steven Herbert as principal. He replaces Blane Collison, who served as principal for eight years, ending 41 years in education.Herbert’s hiring follows the school adding Vince Woodall to the newly established role as its chief operations officer. He will oversee the school’s non-academic operations, including financial resources, human resources, facilities, technology, and legal affairs. Strathmann called the leadership team a “three-prone approach” where they will handle academics, curriculum, fundraising, student recruitment and operations.Forming a “dynamic team” committed to guiding Fenwick into a new era of innovation, academic excellence, community service and mission-driven growth was Strathmann’s top priority when he was hired, he said.“Now we’re off to the races,” said Strathmann, who hopes to operate the high school more like a university and refer to teachers as instructors.Herbert, who was awarded his doctorate from Ohio State University, most recently served as professor of physics at John Carroll University where he was also provost and academic vice president for four years.Prior to that, he held a series of academic leadership roles at Xavier University, including associate provost for academic affairs and dean of the graduate school, chair of the Department of Physics and a professor of physics. “I am passionate about Catholic education and have been privileged to shape young minds while witnessing the personal and professional growth of generations of budding business and community leaders,” Herbert said in a statement. “Having the opportunity to now work with students during the crucial, formative years of high school is exciting. This is where real impact happens, where habits are formed and students’ characteristics and spiritual formation mature.” Strathmann called Herbert “the perfect hire for the perfect time.” He said once Fenwick leads with academics “all great things will follow.”With an official start date of June 25, Herbert will spend his first weeks on the job working with school administrators, faculty and staff, Strathmann said.",

    "text": "Le Forze di difesa di Israele (Idf) stanno “espandendo l’operazione nell’area di Khan Younis”, nel sud della Striscia di Gaza, contro il movimento islamista palestinese Hamas. Lo hanno riferito le stesse Idf su X (ex Twitter). Nel frattempo, nel nord di Gaza, la 460esima Brigata corazzata delle Idf ha “ucciso decine di uomini armati di Hamas in una serie di battaglie, tra cui attacchi aerei, fuoco di cecchini, mitragliatrici e bombardamenti”, si legge su X. In particolare, a Jabaliya, la 261esima Brigata delle Idf avrebbe perquisito la casa di un membro di Hamas, trovando armi e documenti attribuiti al gruppo islamista.\nSono almeno 30 le vittime, intanto, di presunti attacchi delle Forze di difesa di Israele (Idf) nei campi profughi di Nuseirat e Maghazi, nel centro della Striscia di Gaza. Lo ha riferito l’emittente panaraba satellitare di proprietà qatariota “Al Jazeera”, secondo cui almeno cinque abitazioni sono state distrutte negli attacchi.\nNella serata di ieri, per la prima volta dal 7 ottobre, il gabinetto di guerra d’Israele ha tenuto una riunione per discutere del piano di gestione della Striscia di Gaza nella fase post bellica. Lo ha reso noto il quotidiano israeliano “The Times of Israel”. Il primo ministro israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu ha offerto scarsi dettagli sui temi affrontati, limitandosi ad affermare che “Israele non permetterà mai all’Autorità nazionale palestinese (Anp) di governare la Striscia” e che “le Forze di difesa israeliane (Idf) manterranno il controllo di sicurezza generale sulla zona”.\nLa riunione è avvenuta a pochi giorni dalla visita a Washington del ministro israeliano per gli Affari strategici, Ron Dermer, durante la quale ha incontrato il segretario di Stato, Antony Blinken, e il consigliere per la Sicurezza nazionale, Jake Sullivan. Il gabinetto di guerra è composto dal primo ministro Benjamin Netanyahu, il ministro della Difesa, Yoav Gallant, e il ministro dell’Interno nonché esponente del Partito di unità nazionale, Benny Gantz. Questi sono i tre membri votanti del gabinetto, mentre hanno funzione di osservatori il ministro degli Affari strategici Ron Dermer e il ministro senza portafoglio Gadi Eisenkot.\nLeggi anche altre notizie su\nNova News\nSeguici sui canali social di Nova News su\nInstagram, Telegram",
