    "text": "The Deputy Secretary-General of the Ghana Federation of Labour, Kenneth Koomson, has announced that the government has agreed to revoke Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2462, which permits mining in forest reserves .\nAccording to him, in an engagement on Thursday, October 3, the government responded to Organised Labour’s demands, which included declaring a state of emergency, revoking L.I. 2462, and deploying the military to forest areas and water bodies to combat illegal mining.\nSpeaking on News Night on Thursday, Mr Koomson said that the government expressed its commitment to addressing these concerns and specifically agreed to revoke L.I. 2462.\n“The substance of this meeting is for the government to respond to the demands that Organised Labour has made with respect to the galamsey issue and how our forest reserves are being depleted.\n“Government agreed to respond officially to the demands that we have made. In fact, the government agreed that the L.I. 2462 was going to be revoked, parliament when it reconvenes – steps were going to be taken to ensure that the L.I. 2462 which is one of the demands is revoked,” he said.\nHe added that while many topics were discussed during the meeting, Organised Labour insisted on receiving an official, written confirmation from the government to ensure transparency and clarity.\n“When we receive the response, we will call an organised labour meeting, table the response of government and discuss it thoroughly and once that has been discussed, we will issue our response to government – this is the position,” he added.\nALSO READ:\nArts & Sciences Academy urges immediate action to halt illegal mining in forest reserves Galamsey: Researchers demand urgent repeal of mining regulations in forest reserves",

    "text": "I Tried to Grow My Email List With A Platform Nobody’s Talking About. Here Are The Results. Is this a new hidden gem to build your list quickly? Last month, I tested a new platform to grow my list. This platform is called Refind. Shockingly, nobody’s really talking about it. At first sight, it seems like a hidden gem where you can get legit email subscribers for less than $1.23. But since I didn’t know whether it was worth it or not, I decided to run an experiment. 23 days later, I ended up with 579 fresh email subscribers. But… was it really worth it? The ugly truth of organic growth I see many creators brag about how to grow their list without spending a single dime on ads. This sounds cool. But they never tell you what’s really happening behind the curtain. Growing a responsive email list is hard and VERY expensive. You’ll have to pay the price either with: - your precious time - your hard-earned money - and sometimes… even both! Organic growth ain’t free. There are many marketing bada**es like [Mike Dillard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-iIeZ86DAc) who were able to grow multimillion-dollar businesses out of paid ads. They’re not necessarily evil. It’s all about the strategy. (More on that later.) Does that mean that I am not growing organically? Absolutely not. I’m growing my email list organically using: - SEO - Medium - and YouTube They all work fine. However, I’m a growth junkie. So I don’t have any issues spending some of the green stuff if I know that I can make it back and grow faster. One of the ways to grow your list is by running ads. You could either sponsor newsletters or run ads on other platforms. I’ve been sponsoring a few newsletters in the past few months, and some did perform well. Others didn’t.",

Brown County Broadcasting’s KOXE and KBWD and Wendlee Broadcasting’s KXYL, KSTA, and KQBZ recently helped toy drives for Toys for Kids of Brown County. The combined efforts of these two stations resulted in a total of $19,464.38 in cash donations and more than 1,200 toys. KOXE and KBWD’s 18th annual Two-Steppin’ for Toys event, amassed $10,964.38 and 1,179 toys, including 38 bicycles. This was the second-highest haul in the history of the event. In turn, Wendlee Broadcasting raised more than $8,500 and a truckload of toys. These donations were delivered to kids on December 16.

Crews assisted two occupants to walk from the vehicle to dry land.\nThis morning (December 29), at 6.20am, fire crews from Easingwold attended an incident on Thornton Bridge in Boroughbridge, which saw firefighters help a man to safety after his car had become stuck in floodwater.\nMeanwhile, several properties in the region were flooded during the last three days of changeable weather.\nOn Thursday (December 28), fire crews attended a house on High Lane in Buttersett, near Hawes, where a fire crew from Hawes responded to a report of flooding in a residential property.\nCrews diverted water away from the property and then attempted to unblock drains to assist in averting the flooding.\nIn the aftermath of the floodwater, North Yorkshire Police has issued some advice to drivers about navigating roads in challenging conditions.",
