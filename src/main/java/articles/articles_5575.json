    "text": "2024-03-29 10:05:32\nEsi Maman | 03/29/2024 13:00\nZoltan Santgiorgi with Avraham Klein and a blessing from Viktor Orban (private)\nAvraham Klein is 90 years old. The Israeli soccer referee, who officiated games in the World Cup and the Olympic Games, was privileged today (Friday) to receive a special blessing from the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, on the occasion of his birthday, which was today.\nHungarian Prime Minister Orban sent a letter to Klein’s home in Haifa in which he congratulated the judge: “Dear Abraham Klein! Your career is a good example of how judges can also become legends. We Hungarians can rightfully boast that you were one of the most influential referees in the history of football, the one who whistled in unforgettable matches such as England’s match against Brazil in the 1970 World Cup or Italy’s match against Brazil in 1982.”\nOrban added in his letter: “Not only are your roots Hungarian, I came to know that you still speak our language perfectly even today. I want to thank you that wherever you go in the world, you never forget to mention the names of your Hungarian colleagues and friends. And in January of this year, at the gala ceremony of the sportsman of the year in Hungary, we were once again convinced that you are in such good shape, to the point that you could manage one more match even after the awards ceremony.”\nYaakov Hadas and Victor Urban (Radad Jabara)\nUrban concluded and wrote to Klein: “Allow me to join the ranks of relatives, friends and fans who congratulate you on your 90th birthday, and wish you good health and success in your mission as an ambassador of the FIFA Museum. Victor Urban”.\nAvraham Klein is a Jew of Hungarian origin, a Holocaust survivor who immigrated to Israel at the end of World War II and became a respected international soccer referee. He refereed the Olympic Games in 1996 and 1976, and even refereed three World Cups in 1970, 1978 and 1982.\nAmong other things, he managed England’s match against Brazil with the legends Bobby Charlton and Pele. The Brazilian star, by the way, became one of his closest friends and Klein even accompanied him on his trips to Europe from time to time. The Israeli also judged Diego Maradona in his first appearances in the Argentine national team.\nAvraham Klein at the podium with FIFA President Gianni Infantino (private)\nAt the last World Cup held in Qatar, Avraham Klein was the guest of honor of FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who chose him to serve as an ambassador for the FIFA Museum. Now, as mentioned, he is celebrating his 90th birthday in Haifa, where the Hungarian ambassador to Israel Zoltan Santgiorgi arrived with a bottle of Hungarian wine to hand him the Prime Minister’s letter.\n#Prime #Minister #Hungary #special #greeting #Abraham #Klein",

    "title": "Taylor Swift AI Photos Spark Outrage as Fans Call For Action",
    "text": "[Taylor Swift](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/taylor-swift/) fans are outraged this week as an alarming amount of AI generated photos featuring the singer have appeared online. The deepfake photos are graphic in nature and have been created without Swift’s consent. Of course, [privacy concerns](https://thenerdstash.com/taylor-swift-makes-it-clear-that-shes-not-ready-for-a-baby-with-travis-kelce/) have been voiced by many. Among those who are enraged by the photos include Swift’s large army of fans, also known as Swifties. The group has taken to social media to speak out about the situation. The photos have garnered so much attention that the phrase “Protect Taylor Swift” began trending on the X app, formerly known as Twitter. “Those Taylor AI pics are straight up sexual harassment and it’s disgusting,” one person commented. “It doesn’t matter how famous someone is, how much you may dislike her- whatever. She is a human being & deserves respect,” another fan wrote. “The situation with AI images of Taylor Swift is insane. It’s disgusting,” a third social media user stated. “I’m very sad about what’s going on with Taylor Swift. It’s scary and horrible,” another comment read. Taylor Wift Fans Fight To Protect the Singer From AI Images Sadly, AI generated images increased in popularity, especially where celebrities are involved. “I’m very confident in saying that in the long run, it will be impossible to tell the difference between a generated image and a real one. The generated images are just going to keep getting better,” computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, James O’Brien, tells [USA Today.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/01/25/taylor-swift-artificial-intelligence-images/72350439007/) Meanwhile, Taylor Swift has stayed quiet about the AI photos. The singer is currently on hiatus from her Eras Tour. She’s been seen several times attending Kansas City Chiefs games to support [her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce](https://thenerdstash.com/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-relationship-may-not-be-as-serious-as-fans-think/). For his part, the athlete has also stayed mum on the situation. However, Swifties are coming out in full force in hopes of having the images taken off social media.",

    "text": "TEMPO.CO, Boyolali - Indonesian Vice President Ma'ruf Amin said that the Makkah Route fast track service for prospective hajj pilgrims signifies a distinctive privilege extended by Saudi Arabia. This year, the service is available at three hajj departure airports: Jakarta, Surabaya, and Solo.“This is special treatment from the Saudi Arabian government. We are given special treatment because the of close and amicable relationship between Indonesia and Saudi,” Ma'ruf told reporters at Adi Soemarmo Airport in Solo, Boyolali Regency, Central Java, after reviewing the service on Friday, May 31.He assessed that the service benefits would-be pilgrims by shortening the document inspection process. “If [the inspection] is done in Jeddah, there will be a queue, not to mention that pilgrims are already exhausted from a nine-hour flight and it takes five hours. But if it is done here, it will take at most five minutes per person. This is an extraordinary convenience for Indonesian hajj pilgrims, even though it is only in three embarkation points,” he explained.Ma'ruf further stressed the government’s commitment to providing better hajj service from year to year, including health services in Saudi Arabia. “That’s the government’s effort to improve hajj services.”In addition to the fast track service, Ma'ruf said Indonesia is granted an additional quota of 20,000 hajj pilgrims. He also hoped that in next year’s hajj season, the number of both airports providing fast-track services and hajj pilgrim quotas could be further expanded. “Because the waiting time here [in Indonesia] is up to 50 years,” Ma’ruf Amin said.SEPTIA RYANTHIEEditor’s Choice: 25 Indonesian Hajj Pilgrims Pass Away in Saudi Arabia, Ministry ConfirmsClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",

    "text": "年逾百萬「假學生」申請加州社區大學 釀千萬詐騙損失 2025-06-26 00:05:36 加州社區大學系統正面臨大規模詐騙危機。根據校方統計，2024年有超過120萬筆入學申請疑為假冒身份，占總申請數的31%，導致聯邦與州政府合計損失逾1,100萬美元的學生財務補助金。\n根據《洛杉磯時報》報道，詐騙者會利用遭盜取的身份資訊與AI技術，大量製造虛假帳號申請入學加州社區大學，之後再申請聯邦與州政府的學生財務援助。\n在加州，多數低收入社區大學生都可以免學費，而補助款常以現金形式發放，詐騙者可直接領取後用於私人開銷。官員指出，有人利用詐得的金援款進行整形手術、度假或購買名牌包。\n洛杉磯社區大學學區副校長阿爾博-洛佩茲（Nicole Albo‑Lopez）表示，有詐騙者甚至親自到現場驗證身份，出示標示體重為「公斤」，而非美國通用的「磅」的加州駕照，引發懷疑。類似事件顯示，這些詐騙行為背後是有意圖的犯罪者，也讓阿爾博-洛佩茲意識到，這些佔滿教室、竊取納稅人錢財的「假學生」背後，都是真實的人在操作。\n2024年，加州社區大學系統共遭詐騙約840萬元聯邦補助金與270萬元加州補助金。而2025年光是1月到4月，又有400萬元聯邦補助與超過76萬美元加州補助被判定為詐騙損失。\n阿爾博-洛佩茲強調，儘管詐騙比例如此之高，但校方仍已透過偵測系統成功攔阻約85%的可疑申請，並未讓他們完成註冊或領取補助。而為了防堵詐騙，州立社區大學系統正研議大規模改革，包括計畫在2026年春季推出全新申請系統，內建詐騙偵測功能。校方目前亦與身份驗證公司ID.me合作，核實申請者真實性。\n此外，一項收取「每人10美元申請費」的提案也正在討論中。加州社區大學過去向來不收取申請費，此措施將成為該系統入學政策的重要轉變。雖然部分人士擔心此舉恐對低收入學生造成障礙，但官員表示，此費用可望成為阻擋詐騙者的門檻，對有經濟困難的學生亦可提供減免或退費機制。\n同時，美國教育部宣布，自今秋起，學生申請補助時需親自或透過即時視訊提交有效政府核發的照片身份證件，並由學校保存副本，暑期入學者也將面臨身份驗證要求。聯邦教育部官員表示，當詐騙行為影響到真正有需求的學生、擾亂校務並浪費納稅人資源時，政府有責任介入。洛杉磯訊",

    "text": "Al mediodía de este viernes comenzará un nuevo paro de aeronáuticos encabezado por Pablo Biró (APLA, pilotos) y Juan Pablo Brey (AAA, tripulantes) y durará 24 horas. Esta medida de fuerza provocó 319 cancelaciones y afectará a más de 37.000 pasajeros, según confirmó\nAerolíneas Argentinas. En Tucumán, al menos 13 vuelos que conectan habitualmente la provincia con Aeroparque, Ezeiza y Córdoba están afectados.\nLa compañía estima que el costo económico de esta medida superará los U$S2,5 millones, producto de la pérdida de ventas y por las multas, compensaciones, hotelería, traslados, comidas y otros gastos derivados del daño directo a pasajeros.\nDel total de afectados, según informó la aerolínea, unas 28.000 personas tenían planeados viajes dentro del país, otras 5.500 a destinos regionales, y las restantes 3.500 vuelos al Caribe, Estados Unidos y Europa.\nDe acuerdo al comunicado, desde el anuncio de la medida, la compañía realizó su máximo esfuerzo por modificar su programación de la manera más eficiente posible, dentro de las restricciones impuestas por los propios gremios, para atenuar el perjuicio que este paro provocará a nuestros pasajeros.\nSeñaló que se reprogramaron vuelos, adelantando y demorando salidas por fuera de la franja de la medida, y se crearon vuelos especiales para redistribuir tráfico afectado. Además, se trabajó con la red de alianzas de Aerolíneas Argentinas para facilitar otras alternativas a las personas que se encontraran en tránsito.\n\"Lamentamos profundamente las molestias provocadas por este paro intempestivo, abusivo y fuera de contexto promocionado por dirigentes gremiales de forma irresponsable. Aerolíneas Argentinas continuará trabajando para seguir ofreciendo un servicio de calidad, confiable y seguro a sus pasajeros\", sostiene el documento.\nLa compañía estatal también indicó que se les está anticipando de la situación a los usuarios para que puedan cambiar sus vuelos \"sin cargo\" y se está tratando de \"reubicar y reacomodar\" a los pasajeros ante la contingencia.\nQuiénes van al paro\nEl paro de 24 horas que comenzará hoy a las 12 y será cumplido por los trabajadores afiliados a APLA y AAA, pero otros dos sindicatos del sector, la Asociación del Personal Aeronáutico (APA) y la Unión del Personal Superior y Profesional de Empresas Aerocomerciales (UPSA), anunciaron que harán asambleas que, en la práctica, afectarán la actividad en Intercargo y en las aerolíneas extranjeras.\nLa medida de fuerza también afectará a Flybondi y Jetsmart. En el primer caso, la empresa anunció que, “en el marco de la conflictividad gremial y ante la falta de confirmación de la normal prestación del servicio de rampa en Aeroparque, trasladará su operación a partir de las 12 horas del mediodía del viernes 13 y hasta el mediodía del sábado 14 al Aeropuerto Internacional de Ezeiza”.\nVuelos afectados por el paro de Aerolíneas Argentinas desde Tucumán\nViernes 13\n-Partidas\nDestino Aeroparque\nAR 1481, debía partir a las 15.50\nAR 1475, debía partir a las 19.10\nDestino Ezeiza\nAR 1485, debía partir a las 21.30\n-Arribos\nDesde Aeroparque\nAR 1480, debía aterrizar a las 15.10\nAR 1484, debía aterrizar a las 20.40\nDesde Córdoba\nVuelo 1582, debía aterrizar a las 18.20\nSábado 14\n-Partidas\nDestino Aeroparque\nAR 1469, debía partir a las 8.25\nAR 1473, debía partir a las 11\nDestino Córdoba\nAR 1583, debía partir a las 9.25\n-Arribos\nDesde Ezeiza\nAR 1470, debía partir a las 6.45\nAR 1472, debía partir a las 8.20\nDesde Aeroparque\nAR 1468, debía partir a las 5.45\nAR 1474, debía partir a las 10.10",
