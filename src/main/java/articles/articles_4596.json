    "title": "Interim President McCormick Joins Student Leaders in ‘Fireside Chat’",
    "text": "Stony Brook University Interim President [Richard McCormick](https://www.stonybrook.edu/pres/) recently sat down with two members of the [Undergraduate Student Government ](https://stonybrookusg.com/)(USG) to discuss his vision for the university, the importance of student engagement, and his initiatives during his time as interim president.\nMcCormick spoke with Sarah Alberouti, USG vice president of university affairs, and Lamia Rothi, USG vice president of communications in the “Fireside Chat.”\n“I wake up every morning happy to go to work,” McCormick shared. “This is the most enjoyable position I’ve ever held.”\nMcCormick is a scholar of U.S. political history and brings decades of academic and administrative experience to Stony Brook. He reflected on his career, which includes leadership roles at Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of Washington.\nHe noted the unique characteristics of Stony Brook’s students. “Half come from economically disadvantaged families, and about 40 percent qualify for federal Pell Grants,” he said. “What’s extraordinary is that Pell recipients graduate at slightly higher rates than their peers. That’s something I’ve never seen at another university.”\nHe also highlighted the university’s growing popularity. “Applications for next year’s first-year class are up 35 percent from this year and nearly 100 percent from 2022. This school is hot!”\nWhen asked about increasing undergraduate research opportunities, McCormick emphasized the importance of students taking initiative. “Go to your department chair or professor and ask about research opportunities,” he advised. “Research teaches you how to create knowledge, work in teams, and apply what you’ve learned. These are invaluable skills for life.”\nHe acknowledged the perception that STEM dominates research at Stony Brook but noted that the humanities, social sciences, and arts are equally vital. “You can’t have a great university without excellence in these areas,” he said, encouraging students to explore programs like [Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ureca/) (URECA).\nMcCormick shared details about the Stony Brook Future Scholars Program, a mentorship initiative targeting rising eighth graders in underserved communities. “We promise to guide them through high school, ensuring they’re college-ready,” he said. “This program transforms families, not just individuals, and by doing so, it transforms communities.”\nHe also highlighted efforts to increase collaboration between the East Campus health sciences and the West Campus departments, as well as his commitment to securing funding for improved facilities.\nFrom attending student events like [Light the Brook](https://news.stonybrook.edu/university/light-the-brook-ignites-holiday-spirit-and-stony-brook-pride/) to hosting monthly student dinners, McCormick prioritizes direct communication with students. “These conversations are invaluable,” he said. “Students share honest feedback, and I bring their concerns back to my team to address them.”\nAs interim president, McCormick is focused on continuing Stony Brook’s momentum and fostering its supportive culture. “While I’m here, I’m not just an interim president — I’m the president,” he stated. “I want to connect with the campus community and celebrate what makes Stony Brook special.”\n“This conversation was incredibly informative,” Alberouti said. “It’s clear you’re passionate about advancing Stony Brook’s mission and connecting with its students.”",

    "text": "Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. — Matthew 6:4\nEvery day, Glen purchases his morning coffee at a nearby drive-through. And every day he also pays for the order of the person in the car behind him, asking the cashier to wish that person a good day. Glen has no connection to them. He’s not aware of their reactions; he simply believes this small gesture is “the least he can do.” On one occasion, however, he learned of the impact of his actions when he read an anonymous letter to the editor of his local newspaper. He discovered that the kindness of his gift on July 18, 2017, caused the person in the car behind him to reconsider their plans to take their own life later that day.\nGlen gives daily to the people in the car behind him without receiving credit for it. Only on this single occasion did he get a glimpse of the impact of his small gift. When Jesus says we should “not let [our] left hand know what [our] right hand is doing” (Matthew 6:3), He’s urging us to give—as Glen does—without need for recognition.\nWhen we give out of our love for God, without concern for receiving the praise of others, we can trust that our gifts—large or small—will be used by Him to help meet the needs of those receiving them. — Kirsten Holmberg\nHow have you benefited from someone’s anonymous giving? How can you give more “in secret”?\nFather, thank You for using me to meet the needs of others and for meeting my needs through them. Help me not to seek credit when I give but to do so in a way that gives You the glory.",

    "text": "Arne Slot's runaway leaders make the most of festive gifts elsewhere and bounce back from early scare as Gakpo, Jones and Salah have Anfield dreaming of big things in 2025\nTHE FOGGY PHEW: Liverpool's Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring their side's third goal of the game after they recovered from an early scare during the Premier League match at Anfield, Liverpool. Pic: Peter Byrne/PA Wire\nThu, 26 Dec, 2024 - 22:08 Ian Whittell  \n    LIVERPOOL 3 LEICESTER CITY 1\nCODY Gakpo, Curtis Jones and Mo Salah ensured Liverpool headed towards the end of a potentially traumatic 2024 in rude health with a seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League.\nThat may change by Friday night when Arsenal host lowly Ipswich at the Emirates but, even if Arne Slot’s advantage is “only” six points, that represents a brilliant first half of the season in his new job.\nAfter all, the no-nonsense Dutchman appeared to have been handed one of the most poisoned of chalices when he took over from cult hero Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager this summer. Put simply: how do you follow that?\nMore that one expert questioned whether the former Feyenoord manager was equipped to lead a squad that fell off badly in last season’s title race under the leadership of the great German.\nThe answer, we now know five months later, is a resounding yes, with Slot guiding Liverpool towards what would be just the second league title in the past 35 seasons.\nAnd, on a St. Stephen's Day when Chelsea were surprisingly beaten at home, that means that Slot and Liverpool could take delivery of the most welcome of holiday gifts as they continue to chase trophies on four fronts.\nYet there were challenges here, perhaps more than would have been expected pre-match with Liverpool relieved to be going in level at the interval, although the picture should have been more favourable, given their first-half dominance.\nThey twice hit the Leicester woodwork and set the tone for the first half as early as the fourth minute when Mo Salah forced debutant keeper Jakub Stolarcyk into a good stop at his near post.\nThe Pole followed that with some sharp handling to deny Curtis Jones’ follow-up effort as the leaders looked to build on their advantage at the top.\nBut just two minutes later, they were stunned by a devastating Leicester counter attack that resulted in Jordan Ayew shooting the visitors in front. Bilal El Khannouss put Stephy Mavididi away down the left and his cross found Ayew, back to goal and marked tightly by Andrew Robertson.\nThe Leicester winger turned quickly, shrugged off his marker and sent a perfect low finish into the bottom corner of the home goal.\nIt was a major shock for a Liverpool team that had not lost a game for 103 days, since Nottingham Forest escaped Anfield with a shock 1-0 win. And the response from Slot’s in-form side was predictably committed and threatening.\nIn the 25th minute, Robertson’s header, from a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross, struck the post and might have rebounded into the goal off Stolarcyk but flew just wide. Then, in the final minute of normal time, Salah curled a superb shot over the keeper but saw it strike the bar and fly to safety.\nThe consolation came in the first minute of stoppage time, however, when Alexis Mac Allister picked out Gakpo on the edge of the Leicester area. The Dutchman had space to take aim and curl an unstoppable shot past Stolarcyk and into the far corner.\nIt was a deserved, and inevitable, equaliser and one which gave Anfield renewed belief as soon as play re-started, with the Reds going in front just four minutes into the second half.\nThe goal followed a passage of intricate pass and move football from Liverpool, which seemed to mesmerise the visitors, before Mac Allister crossed from the right and Jones was unmarked to turn the ball in from five yards.\nThere was a lengthy VAR check, for an offside on as many as three passages of play, before the goal was confirmed and Anfield was finally ready to celebrate.\nThe goal was a hammer blow to Ruud van Nistelrooy’s hopes of pulling off the first major upset of his English managerial career.\nFor Slot, meanwhile, every passing week makes his claims that Liverpool are not title favourites ring increasingly hollow. Protest all he might, a record of 22 wins, three draws and that Forest defeat in his 26 league and cup games in charge suggests otherwise.\nAnfield certainly sounds in the mood to believe, even if this victory was laboured in parts and there are still one or two question marks in key areas of Slot’s line-up.\nDarwin Nunez, for example, remains frustratingly inconsistent in front of goal and he might have put the result beyond Leicester’s reach just after the hour, only to shoot straight at the keeper from Salah’s pass.\nNunez was also the guilty party after 67 minutes when a third Liverpool goal was ruled out, following Gakpo’s powerful finish, as VAR judged his teammate to have been offside in the build-up.\nGakpo turned provider when Liverpool did finally wrap up the three points, eight minutes from time, laying on the pass for Salah to chase into the area before slanting an unstoppable shot past Victor Kristiansen and the diving keeper.\nLiverpool (4-2-3-1): Alisson 6; Alexander-Arnold 7, Gomez 7, van Dijk 7, Robertson 5 (Tsimikas 86); Gravenberch 7 (Endo 86), Mac Allister 8 (Elliott 90); Salah 7, Jones 7 (Szoboszlai 77, 6), Gakpo 9; Nunez 5 (Jota 78, 5). Substitutes (not used) Chiesa, Diaz Kelleher, Quansah.\nLeicester (4-2-3-1): Stolarczyk 8; Justin 7, Coady 6, Vestergaard 6, Kristiansen 7; Winks 6 (Skipp 65, 5), Soumare 6; Ayew 7, El Khannouss 6 (Buonanotte 65, 5), Mavididi 7 (De Cordova Reid 87); Daka 5.
