    "title": "EU overcomes 'Orban fatigue,' passes €50 billion Ukraine aid",
    "text": "In private, EU diplomats say Orban is getting harder and harder to work with\nFrustration with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was palpable among European Union (EU) leaders arriving at a summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss an aid package for Ukraine. For weeks, Orban had been holding back the EU from agreeing upon funds that would prop up Ukraine’s economy, which has been straining under the ongoing war efforts after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.\nHowever, the leaders came to a surprisingly quick result: Within an hour of meeting, the 27 EU members signed off a new €50 billion ($54 billion) aid package to support Ukraine’s economy through 2027. The funds consist of grants and loans financed from the EU budget.\n“We have a deal,” European Council President Charles Michel announced on X, formerly Twitter. “This locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for Ukraine. The EU is taking leadership and responsibility in support for Ukraine,” he wrote.\nThe new cash injection is separate from the substantial military aid the EU and its member states send Kyiv. It is intended to pay for pensions and government salaries and to free up state funds.\n‘Orban fatigue’ sets in In recent years, Hungary’s national-conservative leader Orban has frequently resorted to vetoes to hold up joint EU and NATO decisions, leaving fellow leaders increasingly exasperated, particularly with his stance towards Ukraine. Orban has also been public about his close ties with Russia, raising EU-wide concerns.\nWhile the shared EU position is to support and arm Kyiv “as long as it takes” in its war with Russia, Orban has frequently supported Moscow by delaying bloc measures and sanctions against Russia.\nThe new leader of Poland, a country that until a recent change in government had frequently sided with Orban in some EU debates, had harsh words as he arrived on Thursday.\n“There is no problem with so-called Ukraine fatigue. We have Orban fatigue,” Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. “I can’t understand. I can’t accept this very strange egoistic game,” he added, referring to Orban’s unique stance in blocking EU anonymous decisions.\nOrban sees ‘mission accomplished’ The remaining 26 EU member states were prepared to sign off on the new funds for Ukraine the last time they met in December when the EU also agreed to open EU accession talks with Ukraine. Orban accepted the latter but not the former — hence the need for a dedicated extraordinary summit to revisit the issue on Thursday.\nOne of the points of contention in the deal was an annual mechanism for reviewing the aid package. The official joint EU concluding statement now refers to an annual “debate” on the fund and of the European Commission potentially conducting a review “if needed” in two years. Multiple diplomatic sources from other EU countries told DW they believed the review mechanism was toothless.\nNevertheless, following the signing of the deal, Orban claimed political victory. “Mission accomplished,” he posted on X. “We have a control mechanism at the end of the first and the second year,” he added, omitting the agreement’s details.\nOn Thursday, leader came to a quick breakthrough\nOrban is locked in a long-standing dispute with EU officials who reprimand him for the backsliding of Hungarian democracy under his government. Their most substantial move to date has been withholding EU funds earmarked for Budapest in exchange for rule of law reforms.\n‘Two bitter pills’ Several diplomats told DW the path to a quick agreement was cleared by a string of meetings between various leaders ahead of time. One official told DW that Germany played a large role in swaying Hungary by taking a tougher line than usual.\nThe same diplomat suggested that Hungary simply had to spread two concessions —one on the accession talks and the other on the new fund over two summits.”It seems that the two bitter pills were too much for Orban to take in one summit so it had to be split into two,” the source said.\nIt is not only Europe that is struggling politically to sign off assistance for Ukraine, funding is also held up in Washington\nWith European Council President Charles Michel hailing the summit as a victory for EU unity, it remains to be seen whether Orban will change tack or remain combative.\nElections for the European Parliament are set for June, and for the US presidency in November. In an EU-wide poll, the far right is expected to fare well, while Donald Trump could also return as leader in Washington. That would recast the political landscape in Orban’s favor.\nZelenskyy sees ball passing to Washington Marta Mucznik, an analyst from the conflict resolution think tank International Crisis Group, said that while pressure had apparently brought Hungary’s position around this time, Ukraine’s allies’ support was clearly under strain.\n“It’s increasingly contested ground, Western aid to Ukraine,” Mucznik said. “It’s not just an internal debate. It’s a debate in the United States. It’s a debate also within Europe among different member states with different foreign policy priorities, different threat perceptions, different sensitivities.”\n“As the war drags on (…) it becomes increasingly more difficult for the EU also to convince its own populations of the need to continue to back Ukraine,” she said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the EU decision on Thursday. “It is very important that the decision was made by all 27 leaders, which once again proves strong EU unity,” he posted on X. With an eye toward Washington, where Republican lawmakers have been stalling a package of aid planned by Democrat President Joe Biden, he also said that “with today’s big decisions, Europe is sending a signal across the Atlantic and around the world that the international rules-based world order will endure challenges.”\nEdited by: Maren Sass\nAuthor: Ella Joyner (in Brussels)",

    "title": "China says Taiwan ‘hyping up’ election interference claims",
    "text": "BEIJING: China’s defence ministry on Thursday accused Taiwan’s leadership of “hyping up” claims that Beijing is interfering in the self-ruled island’s upcoming presidential election. Taipei officials have repeatedly raised concerns about election interference and misinformation, and the January 13 vote comes during an escalating pressure campaign by Beijing, which claims the island as part of its territory.\nBut on Thursday Beijing said “the DPP authorities have been hyping up that China’s mainland is interfering in its elections”, using the initials of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party.\nDefence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told a press conference Taipei was trying to “stoke confrontation and manipulate the election”. Several Chinese balloons have been detected moving across the sensitive median line separating Taiwan from China throughout December, Taipei has said.\nAsked about the balloons on Thursday, Wu dismissed allegations of interference.\nTaipei’s claims, he said, were “all familiar pages from their old playbook” but “more and more people in Taiwan” saw through them.\nHis comments came the same day as a CNN report about popular Taiwanese band Mayday being pressured to make pro-China comments, citing Taipei security officials. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Councils — which handles cross-strait issues — accused Chinese authorities on Thursday of “forcing individuals from international cultural, performing arts and sports sectors... to express their political stance... in exchange for opportunities to perform or compete in China”.\n“This has been going on for many years,” the council said in a statement. “We believe that the band (Mayday) will not align with the (Chinese Communist Party) to let down the love and trust of Taiwanese youth.”\nOne of the main themes in the lead-up to the closely watched election is how the presidential candidates will handle relations with China.\nBoth campaign offices for DPP’s frontrunner candidate Lai Ching-te and opposition KMT’s Hou Yu-ih condemned the alleged election interference on Thursday.\n“China’s election interference behaviours continue to become more obvious, and even artists and bands are not spared,” said Lai’s campaign spokesman. Hou, whose KMT party has positioned itself as the one able to restart warmer relations with Beijing, has said Taiwan’s January 13 vote is a choice “between war and peace”.\nComments\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281070/first-half-of-jan24-pol-products-prices-may-be-sustained\">First half of Jan’24: POL products’ prices may be sustained\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281018/china-says-taiwan-hyping-up-election-interference-claims\">China says Taiwan ‘hyping up’ election interference claims\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281055/solar-panel-imports-pca-south-uncovers-another-money-laundering-offence\">Solar panel imports: PCA South uncovers another money laundering offence\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281058/sindh-bilawal-says-nomination-papers-not-being-snatched\">Sindh: Bilawal says nomination papers not being snatched\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281068/dozens-arrested-in-pro-palestinian-protests-at-two-major-us-airports\">Dozens arrested in pro-Palestinian protests at two major US airports\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281066/ecp-directs-punjab-govt-to-ensure-a-level-playing-field\">ECP directs Punjab govt to ensure a level playing field\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281065/ecp-accepts-nawazs-nomination-papers\">ECP accepts Nawaz’s nomination papers\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281064/army-commits-to-offering-support-for-elections\">Army commits to offering support for elections\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281063/imported-coal-based-projects-ecc-okays-settlement-of-issues-with-pqepcl\">Imported coal-based projects: ECC okays settlement of issues with PQEPCL\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281062/anti-polio-drive-pm-seeks-ulemas-help\">Anti-polio drive: PM seeks Ulema’s help\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281059/fd-outlook-misreports-fbr-collection-data\">FD Outlook misreports FBR collection data\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281057/wapda-employees-phc-suspends-notification-to-end-free-electricity\">WAPDA employees: PHC suspends notification to end free electricity\n</a>\nRead more stories Next Story",

    "title": "What is good about Good Friday?",
    "text": "Good Friday is when Christians remember the crucifixion and death of Jesus. But what is good about Good Friday? Good Friday holiday Good Friday commemorates the day that Jesus was crucified, so it might seem strange that the day is called 'good', although for many people the day may be good because it is a public holiday. Good Friday and Christmas Day had long been public holidays in Great Britain, even before the institution of bank holidays in the 1870s. Good Friday is a public holiday in many countries across the world, but in the United States it is only a public holiday in a dozen states of the Union. When is Good Friday? In the Church calendar, Good Friday is always the Friday before Easter. Most years eastern Orthodox Easter and western Easter fall on different dates. In 2024, Good Friday is 29 March in the western tradition, but on 3 May in the eastern Orthodox tradition, where it is called Holy Friday. Origin of the term Good Friday In Old English, Good Friday was called Long Friday, or \"langa frigedÃ¦g\" in Anglo-Saxon. Later it came to be Good Friday, and the earliest recorded reference of this name is from the thirteenth century. Other languages refer to it with names which mean things like Great Friday, Suffering Friday or Holy Friday. In Welsh it is called Dydd Gwener y Groglith. The meaning of the word \"good\" in Good Friday In English, the word \"good\" has different meanings depending upon context. For example, it can mean positive or desirable as in \"it's good that he is well again\"; or it can mean well-behaved as in \"the children were good\"; or it can infer quality as in \"that was good work\"; or it can mean enjoyable as in \"we had a good time\". The word good, can also have a sense of righteous, pious or holy as in \"he lived a good life\" or calling the Bible \"the good book\". It is in this sense that the word \"good\" is used in \"Good Friday\". This sense of holiness is also seen in the Orthodox tradition, where Good Friday is called \"Holy and Great Friday\". In the Netherlands, the day is also called Good Friday as \"Goede Vrijdag\" in Dutch, and \"Goedfreed\" in Frisian. Good Friday falls in the week before Easter known as Holy Week or Passiontide. In addition to Good Friday, the Wednesday before Easter, is also sometimes called Good Wednesday. When was Good Friday? We don't know for sure the actual day that Jesus was crucified on, but many people for various reasons reckon it to have been on 3 April AD 33, although some other people think it was 7 April AD 30, or even in AD 29 or AD 31 depending on which commentary you read. Whichever year it was, the two thousandth anniversary is soon. Lectionary readings The readings for Good Friday in the Revised Common Lectionary, are Isaiah 52:13-53:12, known as the suffering servant passages, which are read by Christians as messianic prophecies; Psalm 22, which Jesus quotes from the cross; Hebrews 10:16-25, or Hebrews 4.14-16 and 5.7-9, which unpack the theology of the cross; and John 18:1-19:42, which tells the story of the crucifixion. What was good about Good Friday? Christians do not claim that crucifixion is good. However, there is the idea that Good Friday was good, in the sense of holy. Good Friday commemorates that Jesus died, so that everyone could be forgiven. This means that it is what the crucifixion achieved which is good, rather than the execution itself. Good Friday can also be considered to be good, because it led to the resurrection of Jesus. Jesus's triumph over death and sin is a key part of the Christian message often called the gospel or the \"good news\". Hot cross buns A curious tradition is to eat warm 'hot cross buns' on Good Friday. These buns have sweet and fruity flavours. The custom involves serving the sweet buns with pieces of fruit in, seasoned with spices such as clove or nutmeg, and decorated on top with a pastry cross. The tradition is to eat them on Good Friday, when they are often cut or split, and then toasted and then buttered. One suggestion is that the origin of the hot cross bun may stem from a 1592 decree issued by the London clerk of markets, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, when there were regulations on the size, shape and price of bread, so that no bakers were allowed to 'make, utter, or sell' ... 'spice cakes, bus, biscuits, or other spice bread' except for funerals, Christmas and Good Friday. The bread is a reminder of the bread eaten at the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26-29), and the spices are a reminder of the spices used to wrap the body in the tomb (John 19:39-40). Two pieces of pastry on top of the bun are made in the shape of a cross, which symbolises and reminds us of the cross that Jesus was crucified on. Good Friday services On Good Friday some Christians also take part in a Walk of Witness. These are often organised by local Churches Together groups. They typically start with a united service when Christians gather together, often from across local denominations, who then walk through the streets of their town together. They do this to remember that Jesus had to carry his cross publicly through the streets of Jerusalem. The story of the crucifixion and death of Jesus is told in all four Gospel accounts in Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23 and John 19. In Mark 15:34 we read that Jesus died \"at the ninth hour\". In the Jewish reckoning, this meant the ninth hour since dawn, which we would call three o'clock. For this reason, many churches hold a special Good Friday afternoon service which either starts or finishes at 3 p.m.",

Je me suis rendu compte que l'on pouvait obtenir de très bonnes saveurs », raconte le facétieux patron de 44 ans alors qu'on se presse dans sa pâtisserie, appelée Roberto. Ragoût de tripes, viande hachée, concombres marinés Alors ragoût de tripes, viande hachée, concombres marinés ? Ceux qui sont en quête d'un rafraîchissement gourmand en sont pour leurs frais. Surtout les plus jeunes : Zeteny Kiss, 10 ans, dont la « langue est habituée au sucré », fait la moue en goûtant du bout des lèvres un cornet. Son père Krisztian Kiss, un avocat de 43 ans originaire de l'autre bout du pays, n'aurait pas fait le détour exprès, mais il « fallait bien tester » ce nouveau phénomène vu qu'ils étaient en visite dans le coin. Il est agréablement surpris de retrouver réellement les saveurs affichées de ces glaces atypiques. « Pour moi, ce sera soupe à la tomate, tomme de brebis à l'aneth et fromage pané », sourit une cliente, prévoyant déjà de revenir goûter à ces « surprenantes mais délicieuses glaces ». Carton sur TikTok Sur les réseaux sociaux, les avis sont aussi partagés, certains commentateurs les qualifiant de « dégueu » ou les recommandant « uniquement à ceux qui ont l'estomac bien accroché ». Qu'importe, le pari est réussi : les vidéos TikTok postées par le glacier attirent des dizaines de milliers de vues, allant même jusqu'à un million dans un pays de moins de 10 millions d'habitants. À 1,27 euro (500 forints) la boule, le chiffre d'affaires a plus que triplé comparé à l'été dernier et un projet de deuxième boutique dans la capitale est déjà sur les rails. Ne reste plus qu'à se faire son avis.",

    "text": "El abogado del expresidente de la Generalitat Carles Puigdemont, Gonzalo Boye, ha asegurado este jueves por la noche que su defendido \\\"se ha ido a su casa, donde tiene su lugar de trabajo\\\", tras su regreso, aunque sin precisar si se refiere al domicilio en el que reside desde hace casi 7 años en Bélgica. En declaraciones a TV3 publicadas en su portal y recogidas por Europa Press, el letrado ha dicho que cuando Puigdemont terminó su discurso en Barcelona minutos antes del pleno para investir a Salvador Illa(PSC) presidente de la Generalitat, su defendido se fue a casa \\\"como hace todo el mundo cuando termina de trabajar\\\" y, desde ese momento no ha vuelto a hablar con él. Así lo ha expresado a las puertas de la Ciutat de la Justícia, donde ha asistido jurídicamente al segundo de los dos mossos detenidos este mismo jueves en el dispositivo policial para localizar al expresidente, y sobre el que ha dicho que \\\"ya están tardando en dejar en libertad\\\" porque no hay ningún delito en el Código Penal que recoja estos hechos. Sobre si el expresidente tiene previsto llegar a un acuerdo con los Mossos d'Esquadrapara pactar una detención, Boye ha respondido que Puigdemont \\\"no se entregará nunca\\\". \\\"Ha dicho que vendría a la investidura y yo creo que ha participado de manera clara\\\", ha dicho sobre la breve visita del expresidente, que ha logrado burlar un dispositivo de seguridad en el que su abogado ha dicho textualmente que hubo nerviosismo y se ha detenido a diestro y siniestro.",

    "text": "EL NUEVO DIARIO, JERUSALÉN.- El Ejército israelí atacó este viernes varios puestos de Líbano en respuesta al lanzamiento de proyectiles y misiles antitanque desde territorio libanés hacia Israel, mientras siguen las hostilidades con la milicia chií libanesa Hizbulá. Esta tarde, «se identificaron varios lanzamientos (de cohetes) desde Líbano hacia Israel, dos de los cuales cruzaron a territorio israelí», dijo un portavoz militar de Israel en un comunicado, después de que las alarmas antiaéreas sonaran en comunidades israelíes en el área fronteriza con este país árabe durante la jornada. En respuesta, la artillería israelí «atacó el punto de origen del fuego», detalló la misma fuente, que agregó que este viernes las tropas «atacaron una célula terrorista de Hizbulá responsable de lanzar misiles antitanque» hacia el norte de Israel. En las últimas horas, «aviones de combate israelíes atacaron la infraestructura terrorista de Hizbulá en la zona de Wadi Hamul en Líbano», y «entre los objetivos atacados se encontraban puntos de lanzamiento (de proyectiles), un complejo militar e infraestructura terrorista adicional». Según añadió la portavocía militar, esta mañana también «se identificaron varios lanzamientos desde el Líbano hacia las zonas de Dovev y Baram en el norte de Israel», las fuerzas israelíes también atacaron «las fuentes de los lanzamientos» con artillería. La frontera israelí-libanesa vive su mayor tensión desde la guerra que libraron Hizbulá e Israel en 2006, a raíz de un recrudecimiento de las agresiones por parte de las milicias propalestinas al día siguiente del estallido de la guerra entre el grupo islamista Hamás e Israel en Gaza, el pasado 7 de octubre. Desde el comienzo de las hostilidades en la zona, se registraron más de 171 muertos: 13 en Israel -9 soldados y 4 civiles- y al menos 159 en el Líbano, incluyendo 122 miembros de Hizbulá, 16 integrantes de milicias palestinas, un soldado y 20 civiles -entre ellos tres periodistas y tres niños-. Israel ha desplegado más de 200.000 soldados en su frontera norte, donde la violencia también ha provocado el desplazamiento de miles de habitantes: Unas 80.000 personas han sido evacuadas de las comunidades del norte de Israel y más de 70.000 han huido del sur del Líbano.",

    "text": "La Junta de los prestigiosos [ Premios Pulitzer](https://gestion.pe/noticias/premios-pulitzer/) otorgó en su 108.ª edición una mención especial a “la valiente labor” de los periodistas palestinos que cubren la guerra en Gaza desde el pasado 7 de octubre, así como hacia sus compañeros fallecidos mientras informaban de dicho conflicto. “Este año, se reconoce la valiente labor de los [periodistas](https://gestion.pe/noticias/periodistas/) y trabajadores de los medios de comunicación que cubren la [ guerra en Gaza. ](https://gestion.pe/noticias/guerra-en-gaza/)En condiciones espantosas, un número extraordinario de periodistas han muerto en el esfuerzo por contar la historia de los palestinos y los trabajadores humanitarios en Gaza”, detalló la organización este lunes durante la retransmisión virtual de estos galardones. Los Premios Pulitzer, entregados por la Universidad de Columbia [ (Nueva York) ](https://gestion.pe/noticias/nueva-york/)a lo más selecto del periodismo, los libros, el teatro y la música, expresaron este lunes que anteriormente ya habían reconocido el trabajo de periodistas en guerras como la de [ Ucrania ](https://gestion.pe/noticias/ucrania/)o [Afganistán ](https://gestion.pe/noticias/afganistan/)y que esta mención especial va más allá por su eco en otros campos. LEA TAMBIÉN: [La FIP condena la muerte de 109 periodistas en Gaza desde octubre] LEA TAMBIÉN: [Dos premios Pulitzer para la fotografía] “Esta guerra (Gaza) también se ha cobrado la vida de poetas y escritores (...) Con la entrega de los Premios Pulitzer a las categorías de Periodismo, Artes y Letras conmemoramos la pérdida de valiosísimos testimonios en primera línea que ilustran el sufrimiento humano”, concluyó el comunicado de la Junta. Entre todos los premios en categorías periodísticas de los Pulitzer, la guerra en Gaza también estuvo presente en otros apartados como el que condecora a lo mejor del periodismo internacional. En esta categoría, el premio recayó sobre la redacción de The New York Times por su “amplia y reveladora” cobertura del “ataque letal” de una facción del grupo islamista Hamás en el sur de Israel el 7 de octubre, así como por sus informaciones sobre “los fallos de los servicios de inteligencia israelíes y la mortífera respuesta del Ejército israelí en Gaza”. Por otra parte, la mención especial a los periodistas palestinos estuvo acompañada por otro reconocimiento de este mismo tipo al escritor y periodista estadounidense Greg Tate (1957-2021), todo un icono desde el entorno de los medios de comunicación de la cultura afroamericana. “Su lenguaje, procedente de la literatura, el mundo académico, la cultura popular y el hip hop, fue tan influyente como el contenido de sus ideas. Sus innovaciones estéticas y su originalidad intelectual, especialmente en su crítica pionera del hip hop, siguieron influyendo en las generaciones posteriores, sobre todo en los escritores y críticos de color”, explicó la organización.
