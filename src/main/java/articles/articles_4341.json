    "text": "Through April 28, 2024, Knott’s Berry Farm is once again inviting guests to “tempt their taste buds” with its annual Boysenberry Festival, inspired by Walter Knott’s famous berry that started it all.\nPhotos by Jacob Goldberg By Jacob Goldberg\nAfter passing the turnstiles, visitors are immediately greeted with “berry” colorful decorations and berry-themed flower arrangements, making the event feel like the welcome return of spring in Southern California.\nBerry Bites and Sips Guests can sink their teeth into three dozen boysenberry food and drink offerings, including vegan and vegetarian options like the roasted zucchini wrap, boysenberry parfait with chia, and a portobello caprese with boysenberry balsamic.\nIn Knott’s famous Ghost Town, various food vendors offer menus of boysenberry dishes. While this seems to be one of Knott’s Berry Farm’s most ambitious festivals to date, guests should be aware that not all dishes are made equally.\nWith this year’s extensive menu, many dishes not only lacked the strong visual appeal of previous iterations but also had very little flavor to back them up. One example is the boysenberry charcuterie board, featuring a basic meat spread with a few crumpled bits of goat cheese, all hastily wrapped in plastic wrap.\nHowever, not all hope is lost, as there are plenty of flavorful boysenberry offerings that are enticing for both the eyes and tongue, including the boysenberry sausage with boysenberry sauerkraut, which offers a sweet twist on the famous delicacy – and no one can go wrong with a fresh glass of the boysenberry cucumber lemonade.\nBoysenberry Sausage with Boysenberry Sauerkraut. Boysenberry Cucumber Lemonade. The Gold Mine Trail Booth offers the Boysenberry BBQ Beef Barbacoa on Mac & Cheese and the Boysenberry Pulled Pork over Pastel de Elote.\nBoysenberry BBQ Beef Barbacoa on Mac & Cheese Boysenberry Pulled Pork over Pastel de Elote Our advice is to choose your boysenberry dishes wisely, especially if you decide to purchase the Boysenberry Tasting Card with a finite supply of six festival tastings (currently priced at $55 plus tax).\nFunnel Cake with Boysenberry Ice Cream. Click here for our rundown of all the Knott’s Boysenberry Festival food and beverage items.\nMore Knott’s Boysenberry Festival Offerings If your stomach is starting to feel full just reading this, don’t worry. The Boysenberry Festival offers much more than food. The festivities also provide unique and creative ways to celebrate all things boysenberry.\nIf you take a trek past the famous wooden coaster Ghost Rider, you’ll find yourself in Boysenberry Lane, featuring local merchants, photo opportunities, and carnival-style games where you can win festival memorabilia.\nThroughout the park, 30 local vendors sell boysenberry-inspired artisan products as part of the Craft Fair hosted in Knott’s Ghost Town.\nWander into almost any gift shop to find limited-edition Boysenberry Festival merchandise. You can bring home boysenberry pie slippers or return with some of the flavors with a can of boysenberry preserves.\nFor guests with a competitive edge, the park once again offers its famous pie-eating contest, where competitors have to clean their plates the fastest without using their hands.\nWith bountiful food options, live entertainment, and the usual assortment of attractions, this year’s Knott’s Boysenberry Festival has something for everyone.

    "text": "Dozens of people gathered outside Saskatoon City Hall Thursday after to march to the Emergency Wellness Centre in support of the city’s homeless population. “These are people that care and want to help,” said Saskatoon Tribal Council Chief Mark Arcand. “That’s what we are doing this for. We are not doing this for politics.” Arcand said the walk is about raising awareness about the high number of unhoused in Saskatoon and to raise support for the shelter’s operations. [sent to your email, as it happens.](javascript:void(0)) [sent to your email, as it happens.](javascript:void(0)) “We are helping the people who don’t have a voice, have a voice. We are speaking up for them,” Arcand said. The Emergency Wellness Centre, run by STC, has been under fire since its opening in 2022. Residents of the Fairhaven neighbourhood have said crime has increased in the area and people don’t feel safe living near the facility. “I’m open to the police having an office in our building to help the neighbourhood deal with the crime if that’s the best solution we can do in this situation.” Arcand said the EWC still has to turn people away as they can only provide 106 spaces. He said the Salvation Army is operating at full capacity as well. “We need to be coming down together and not try to close down shelters that are actually open,” Arcand said. “We are housing families. We have paramedics on site everyday. We have social services in our facility. We are making a difference.” Saskatoon resident Clarence McCallum said he hopes people will get on board. “I’m just hoping that the other people recognize that the homeless do need a home. I do feel for them. They have nowhere else to go and the EWC provides that home for stability.”",

    "text": "Tensions Mount at Democratic Convention Over Gaza Conflict U.S. support for Israel in the war in Gaza has emerged as a divisive issue at the Democratic Party convention, leaving pro-Palestinian delegates upset with Kamala Harris. Despite calls for an urgent end to the war and hostages' release, the absence of a Palestinian speaker has sparked protests and tensions among party members. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 23-08-2024 06:45 IST | Created: 23-08-2024 06:45 IST The most divisive issue facing the Democratic Party, U.S. support for Israel in the war in Gaza, has gone mostly unaddressed during the four-day convention which ends on Thursday, leaving pro-Palestinian delegates upset with presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Harris is expected to call for an urgent end to the war during her Thursday acceptance speech and for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, two sources familiar with her remarks said. She will not address U.S. arms sales to Israel, according to the sources. Muslim delegates and their allies had pushed for a prime-time speaking slot to address the conflict, which began Oct.7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200. Israel's retaliation, with the aid of U.S. support, has killed 40,000 Palestinians, Gaza health officials say. A campaign spokesperson declined to explain the decision not to schedule a speech by a Palestinian speaker, or to say whether a last-minute speaker could be added, although sources familiar with Thursday's program said it was essentially locked. The decision was made by DNC organizers in close consultation with the Harris campaign, sources familiar with the discussions said. Pro-Palestinian advocates on Thursday vowed to keep pressuring Harris to change course on arms sales to Israel. Party insiders fear the Gaza war could cost Harris needed votes in battleground states such as Michigan, which is home to cities with significant Muslim and Arab American populations and college campuses that have been the site of Gaza protests. The convention is being held in Chicago, home to the United States' largest Palestinian community, according to the Arab American Institute. U.S. Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan said he had been urging the campaign to have Harris address the issue in a separate speech in his state. About a dozen delegates from the Uncommitted National Movement, which mobilized nearly 750,000 voters to withhold their support for President Joe Biden during the primaries, spent Wednesday night on the sidewalk outside the convention to protest the DNC's rejection of their request for a Palestinian speaker. They welcomed a call for a ceasefire and the return of hostages by the parents of one U.S. hostage held in Gaza - Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin - on Wednesday night, but said they should also have been given a chance to speak. SOLIDARITY, PROTESTS The United Auto Workers union and the Movement for Black Lives are among several groups and individuals who have issued statements of support for the demonstrators. Muslim Women for Harris-Walz said on X it would cease operations after the DNC decision. \"Last night, the DNC made clear that it values Palestinian lives and voices less than others. It is unconscionable to silence Palestinian voices as they face U.S.-funded massacre, starvation and ethnic cleansing,\" said the Movement for Black Lives, a network of over 150 leaders and organizations. The issue has drawn thousands of protesters to marches throughout the week, with police reporting dozens of arrests. Ruwa Romman, a Georgia state legislator and delegate who spent the night outside the DNC, said Uncommitted organizers had negotiated with the Harris campaign for weeks and provided a list of possible speakers, only to be rejected. \"At least give us something symbolic,\" she said, adding she and other Uncommitted delegates wanted to support Harris but needed something tangible to sway skeptical voters. Rima Mohammad, a Michigan delegate who also took part in the overnight protest, said delegates would keep pressure on Harris in coming weeks. \"This is just a bad look. You're going to lose Michigan,\" said Mohammad, who teaches at the University of Michigan's College of Pharmacy in Ann Arbor. The Uncommitted delegates re-entered the convention center with locked arms on Thursday evening, shortly before Harris was due to speak. Only a handful of references to the war have been made from the DNC stage. Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders and Raphael Warnock and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were among those who addressed Gaza. One major Harris campaign donor, who requested anonymity to be candid about their private conversations with the campaign, said they worried that without a near-term ceasefire deal and clear statements from Harris about ending the war and protecting civilians, campus protests could flare again when universities resume classes in coming days. \"We need every vote,\" the donor said. Tariq Habash, who in January quit his senior job at the Department of Education in protest at the U.S. role in the war, said keeping the issue off the agenda would not help Democrats as they tried to build a \"big tent\" party and defeat former President Donald Trump. \"The indignity and the erasure of Palestinians in our country and in this party throughout this entire week will not be forgotten,\" he said.

    "text": "Baldur’s Gate 3 player shows simple trick to decimate undead armyLarian Studios\nMany Baldur’s Gate 3 players have recounted a myriad of battle strategies in this incredible TTRPG, and often, they decide to share their smoothest moves with the community. This time, a BG3 player has showcased the best way to deal with a pesky undead swarm.\nMost RPG players know that the undead are the most annoying (if not the worst) enemies you can face in a game, and in\nBaldur’s Gate 3, there’s no exception to the rule. Though brittle in comparison with other types of enemies, undead monsters have certain qualities that make them hard to deal with.\nWhen facing the undead enemies in Baldur’s Gate 3, you need to be conscious of your surroundings and avoid getting swarmed. In small numbers, they represent a mild threat since they are pretty squishy. But the problem resides when their number multiplies significantly. More so if they are accompanied by Aberrations, Skeleton Champions, and Lesser\nDemons.\nBut a BG3 player found a smart way to deal with these pest-like enemies with ease, and they shared it on Reddit. Be advised though, that the following part contains spoilers for Acts 2 and 3.\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.\nReddit user ‘Rain_BMW_46’ posted this on the\nhttps://baldursgate3.game/ subreddit: “Easy way to deal with Balthazar’s minions.” The OP then explained: “I had a lot of trouble with him, then I figured you can move the skeletons around before the fight. I clumped them all together with mage hand and used Ice Storm + Fireball to instantly wipe them out as soon as the fight begins.”\nMany players hurried to recognize the OP’s ingenuity, one of them, found this easy trick incredibly useful and said: “This is awesome. Thanks OP.” And another one wrote: “This is Genius. Never thought about that move!”\nMeanwhile, another BG3 enthusiast suggested: “Wait couldn’t you also push them off the edge with Thunderwave or whatever it’s called?” However, many players explained that the spell Thunderwave can be resisted by some of the undead enemies, thus making it ineffective in dealing with Balthazar’s army of the dead.\nIf you are considering yourself an undead army,\nthis Necromancer build is for you. But if you want to look for the quickest way to purge unholy creatures from existence, then we suggest the strongest Cleric Build.",
