    "title": "Climate change is disrupting the human gut in a new path to illness - The Hindu",
    "text": "Climate-driven food shortage and undernourishment could affect the composition of the human gut microbiota, exacerbating the effects of climate change on human health, according to a new review article published in The Lancet Planetary Health .\nThe article comes on the heels of a growing number of studies that highlight the key role food and nutrition play in maintaining a healthy microbial population in the human gut, leading to better metabolic and intestinal health.\nDiversity disrupted According to the review, climate-induced changes in the yield and nutritional quality of plants, seafood, meat, and dairy could disrupt this microbial diversity, tipping the balance towards microbial strains associated with malnutrition and particular diseases.\nThe review also warns that these effects will be more pronounced in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) since these regions face the brunt of climate stressors, including higher temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide, which affect their agricultural output and increase render deficiencies in these areas more common.\nIndigenous communities that depend more than other demographic groups on local food sources and which have been shown to have greater gut microbial diversity may also be more susceptible to climate-related changes, the review reads.\nResearch has already found that high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels can diminish the quantity of plant micronutrients like phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and iron, along with protein concentrations in vital crops such as wheat, maize and rice. These effects add to the complexities that affect the gut microbiota.\nWhile the effects of food and nutrition are direct, the review also examined the role of changes in water, soil, and other environmental microbiota as a result of climate change.\nA fine balance In another recent review, published in Dialogues in Health , researchers from the Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, analysed the impact of heat on human and animal health in India. They found that reports of foodborne and waterborne infectious diseases and malnutrition increase with heat.\nAlthough these findings mirror common knowledge about food and water-related illnesses in warmer weather, the resulting implications for gut dysbiosis — the imbalance in gut microbial populations — also need to be considered for future heat-related mitigation efforts, The Lancet review said.\n“While we know and research various effects of climate change on human health, one aspect remains understudied — the effects of changing climate on the microbial communities in the human gut,” Elena Litchman, author of the review in The Lancet and the MSU Foundation professor of aquatic ecology at Michigan State University, said. “This, in part, could be explained by the fact that researchers studying human microbiota do not necessarily think about it in a climate change context.”\nThe human gut is home to about 100 trillion bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Bacteria are this group’s predominant members. The microbes’ overall diversity in the gut influences several aspects of human well-being, including immunity, maintaining glucose levels, and metabolism.\nAccording to a 2018 analysis in The BMJ , lower bacterial diversity has been observed in atopic eczema, types I and II diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease, among other conditions. Researchers are also exploring how gut dysbiosis changes the central nervous system and leads to neurological disorders.\nMore research attention The gut microbiome — the collective genome of the microbes in the gut — has far more genes than the human genome, producing thousands of metabolites that affect the individual’s health and development.\n“Our understanding of the gut microbiota’s role in human health is still evolving,” While climate change is a growing concern in this context, establishing cause and effect is difficult as there are many confounding factors,” Sachit Anand, a paediatric urologist and assistant professor at AIIMS, New Delhi, said. In his research, Anand examines the role of gut microbiota in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.\nHe added that understanding the interactions between the microbiota, the host, and the environment is now gaining more research attention, especially when evaluating an individual’s susceptibility to specific diseases. As climate change becomes a key influencing factor in this ‘triad’, its impact cannot be ignored moving forward, he said.\nIt may be tempting to examine these interdependencies in a linear manner: i.e. that climate-induced changes in crops affect the diet and thus the gut microbiota, or that climate-induced increases in temperatures make enteric infections more prevalent, ultimately disrupting the gut’s microbial population. But both Litchman and Tarini Shankar Ghosh, assistant professor at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, warned that many of these stressors are often playing out simultaneously.\nAs a computational biologist, Ghosh is interested in patterns in data about the human gut microbiome.\n“If you take the example of low-income groups residing in urban environments, you are looking at the impacts of temperature, pollution, lack of quality food, and water supply,” he explained. “There are multiple factors that are disrupting the gut microbiota at the same time.”\nA new science Ghosh also said dysbiosis has been found to be a diagnostic signature in many disease states. According to him, this means it is not just the tipping of the balance towards unfavourable microbial populations that is concerning: dysbiosis also signals a loss of interdependence between ‘normal’ microbial strains, leading to a loss of several metabolic functions in the host.\n“What we need right now is to generate more data to understand how the so-called good bacteria interact with each other and benefit the host. Data generation must go hand-in-hand with connecting this information to climate change, so we know what is happening,” Ghosh said.\nThus, Litchman said, a multidisciplinary approach with researchers from disparate fields coming together is vital to understand the effects of climate change on human gut microbiota. But along with a lack of awareness of climate change’s effects, a paucity of funding programmes to enable such interdisciplinary and international research is a major impediment to future research of this nature, she added.\nOn the flip side, with advances in computational biology and metagenomics — analyses of the genetic makeup of microorganisms in a given environment — researchers are inching closer to unearthing some of the gut microbiota’s secrets. For example, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, professor Vineet Kumar Sharma has developed an open-access database named GutBugBD . It provides information about how the gut microbiome can interact with and alter specific nutraceuticals and drugs, paving the way for therapeutic approaches to modulate gut microbiota in response to various changes.\nThis is just the start, according to Sharma: “At the moment, we are merely doing broader surveys of the gut microbiota to understand what is there and how they are functioning. Even if we introduce healthy microbiota through, say, probiotics, we cannot know if the response will be the same between two individuals. Each person’s gut microbiota is unique, and understanding this uniqueness is important for the way forward.”\nSharmila Vaidyanathan is an independent writer from Bengaluru.\nPublished - May 08, 2025 05:30 am IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "Responding to the data, a Home Office source said ministers expected a “zero tolerance” approach to all crimes committed by police, with forces agreeing in September to pursue “all lines of investigation for all crimes.” , without exception”.\nThe source said: “Since March, there have been record numbers of police and more than £500m extra has been invested. “These additional resources should result in a significant increase in the number of crimes solved.”\nThe figures emerge from the Telegraph’s analysis of the results of inspections of all 43 forces in 2021/22 against eight criteria.\nForces are rated on metrics including looking after their workforce, offering good value for money and treating the public with respect, but when judged solely on crime investigation, ratings fall.\nThey scored worse on these metrics than on other criteria such as crime prevention, treating the public with fairness and respect, and value for money.\nNo force was rated “outstanding” in either investigating crime or responding to the public. Outstanding is the top level of five levels of performance, which then range from good, adequate, requiring improvement, and inadequate.\nThree forces were deemed inadequate to investigate crimes and 19 of them were judged to “require improvement”. Eight were assessed as “inadequate” in their response to the public, and another 17 “required improvement.”\nThe Telegraph’s analysis was based on inspections from 2021/22, covering all 43 forces over the same period to allow a fair comparison. The actions of five forces – the Metropolitan Police, West Midlands, Devon and Cornwall, Staffordshire and Wiltshire – are so worrying that they are currently under special measures.",

    "text": "Hey folks,\nI have some compressed data in zip format downloaded from a database as blobs (using varchar in SQL). Each blob is a zip archive containing a single file named \"data.bin\"\nI am downloading this data in large batches (~100K), but each blob is relatively small (~100 bytes compressed, ~1000 bytes uncompressed).\nI am trying to decompress the data in memory, since writing/unzipping/reading all files to/from disk is quite slow and inefficient.\nHowever, I am not able to find any method in R that can accomplish this, despite the data being easy to unzip once written to disk.\nHere is some code showing the problem; the first part runs successfully, whereas the second part does not work for any of the shown methods.\nz is a raw vector of bytes containing one entry of compressed data\nz\n# Write to disk, unzip, read from disk (works) t <- tempfile(fileext = \".zip\") writeBin(z, t) zip::unzip(zipfile = t, \"data.bin\", exdir = dirname(t)) d <- file.path(dirname(t), \"data.bin\") x <- read_file_raw(d) # Unzip in memory (Does not work) zip::inflate(z) memDecompress(z, \"gzip\") memDecompress(z, \"bzip2\") zlib::decompress(z)\nI was using Claude AI to try to debug this, I ended up with a function that dumps some useful info about the zip file header.\nanalyze_zip_structure <- function(bytes) { # Helper function to convert bytes to unsigned integer (little endian) bytes_to_int <- function(bytes) { sum(as.integer(bytes) * 256^(0:(length(bytes)-1))) } # Print first 50 bytes in decimal for analysis cat(\"First 50 bytes (as integers):\\n\") cat(as.integer(bytes[1:min(50, length(bytes))]), \"\\n\\n\") # Verify ZIP signature if (!identical(bytes[1:4], as.raw(c(0x50, 0x4B, 0x03, 0x04)))) { stop(\"Not a valid ZIP file signature\") } # Parse key ZIP header fields cat(\"ZIP Local File Header Analysis:\\n\") cat(\"--------------------------------\\n\") cat(\"Signature (as integers):\", as.integer(bytes[1:4]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Version needed:\", bytes_to_int(bytes[5:6]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Flags (as integers):\", as.integer(bytes[7:8]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Compression method:\", bytes_to_int(bytes[9:10]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Last mod time (as integers):\", as.integer(bytes[11:12]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Last mod date (as integers):\", as.integer(bytes[13:14]), \"\\n\") cat(\"CRC-32 (as integers):\", as.integer(bytes[15:18]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Compressed size:\", bytes_to_int(bytes[19:22]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Uncompressed size:\", bytes_to_int(bytes[23:26]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Filename length:\", bytes_to_int(bytes[27:28]), \"\\n\") cat(\"Extra field length:\", bytes_to_int(bytes[29:30]), \"\\n\") # Get filename filename_length <- bytes_to_int(bytes[27:28]) if (filename_length > 0) { filename <- rawToChar(bytes[31:(30 + filename_length)]) cat(\"Filename:\", filename, \"\\n\") } # Calculate where compressed data should start header_end <- 30 + filename_length + bytes_to_int(bytes[29:30]) cat(\"\\nHeader ends at byte:\", header_end, \"\\n\") cat(\"Total file size:\", length(bytes), \"\\n\") return(header_end + 1) # Return start position of compressed data } analyze_zip_structure(z)\nFirst 50 bytes (as integers): 80 75 3 4 20 0 0 8 8 0 36 183 104 89 131 32 64 7 99 0 0 0 86 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 100 97 116 97 46 98 105 110 237 145 235 10 128 32 12 133 191 65 143 217 ZIP Local File Header Analysis: -------------------------------- Signature (as integers): 80 75 3 4 Version needed: 20 Flags (as integers): 0 8 Compression method: 8 Last mod time (as integers): 36 183 Last mod date (as integers): 104 89 CRC-32 (as integers): 131 32 64 7 Compressed size: 99 Uncompressed size: 1110 Filename length: 8 Extra field length: 0 Filename: data.bin Header ends at byte: 38 Total file size: 213\nHere's what I think is going on (I could be wrong).\nThere is a difference in the zip format depending on whether data is zipped on disk vs in memory Zipping on disk add a header and tail to the data, whereas zipping in memory does not.\nThe data I am getting from database into memory includes the header and tail (i.e. it was zipped on disk)\nSo in the code below, I need to figure out how to unzip z2 in memory\nz2\nx <- charToRaw(\"this is a test string\") # Zip in memory z1 <- zip::deflate(x)$output # Unzip in memory zip::inflate(z1)$output %>% rawToChar() # Write to disk and zip writeBin(x, \"test.bin\") zip::zip(\"test.zip\", \"test.bin\") # Read zip binary data into memory - how to unzip z2 in memory??? z2 <- readBin(\"test.zip\", \"raw\", n = 1e6)\nI would greatly appreciate any help figuring this out, I've searched all over the internet and have not found a solution to this.\nThanks, Scott",

Doch eine Katastrophe ist ausgeblieben.\nAufatmen in Kalifornien: Nach dem Einsturz eines Tunnels im Großraum der US-Metropole Los Angeles hat die Feuerwehr alle Eingeschlossenen bergen können. 31 Menschen, wohl alle Tunnelarbeiter, seien am Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) lebend und ohne sichtbare Verletzungen gerettet worden, teilte die Feuerwehr mit. Der Unglücksort befindet etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles.\nErsten Berichten der Feuerwehr zufolge gelang es einigen Arbeitern nach dem Einsturz, über einen Berg loser Erde zu klettern. Auf der anderen Seite trafen sie demnach auf Kollegen. Anschließend seien die Eingeschlossenen mit einem Tunneltransportmittel zum Ausgang gebracht worden. Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten und untersuchten sie genauer, hieß es.\nEin großer Rettungseinsatz\nMehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz passierte demnach mehr als acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt. Es handele sich um einen im Bau befindlichen Tunnel für die kommunale Abwasserentsorgung, hieß es weiter. Die Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an.\nEtwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News. Der Tunnel sei insgesamt mehr als 11 Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit, schrieb der US-Sender unter Berufung auf den Betreiber.",
