    "text": "Zelenskiy diz que militares ucranianos reduziram potencial de ataque da Rússia na frente leste 19/09/2024 17h13\n(Reuters) - O presidente da Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, disse nesta quinta-feira que forças ucranianas reduziram o potencial das tropas russas de lançarem ataques contra a região de Donetsk, na frente leste da guerra que já dura mais de dois anos e meio.\nZelenskiy, falando em discurso noturno por vídeo depois de se encontrar com comandantes, afirmou que os militares estão fazendo o melhor “para a resistência de nossas brigadas de batalha”.\n“Neste momento, as Forças de Defesa Ucranianas conseguiram diminuir o potencial de ataque dos invasores na região de Donetsk”, disse.\nO presidente afirmou que a situação permanece “criticamente difícil, com batalhas duras todos os dias”, nos dois setores da frente leste e que estão mais sujeitos a ataques russos: perto das cidades de Pokrovsk e Kurakhove.\nA operação da Ucrânia na região russa de Kursk, lançada no mês passado, teve sucesso ao fazer os militares russos redirecionarem seus recursos para longe da frente leste, afirmou o presidente.\nA captura de soldados russos também aumentou o “fundo de troca” de prisioneiros de guerra da Ucrânia, algo a ser usado como barganha para facilitar as negociações com Moscou.\n“Neste teatro, conseguimos desviar cerca de 40 mil soldados russos”, afirmou. “Nossas medidas ativas prosseguem.”\nO presidente também afirmou que uma pessoa morreu em um ataque russo contra um abrigo de idosos na região ucraniana de Sumy, no norte do país, uma área sujeita a ataques frequentes por parte da Rússia.\n(Reportagem de Ron Popeski e Bogdan Kochubey)\nAs mais lidas agora PIS ANO-BASE 2023 CAI NESTA SEMANA ANTECIPADO?

    "text": "One of the innovations at this year’s Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.\nGermany’s Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.\nIt never happened. Instead, the company ran demonstration flights.\nWhile missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out – Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.\nTalks to borrow €100m (£83m; $106m) from the government failed in April .\nNow hopes are pinned on China’s Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report . The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.\nVolocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.\nTheir machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter but without the cost, noise and emissions.\nHowever, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.\nLilium’s radical design involves jets which can be angled for vertical take-off One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.\nThe German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme .\nLilium’s aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.\nThe concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.\nIt was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote-controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.\nAs recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium’s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.\n“We are definitely burning through cash,” he told the BBC. “But this is a good sign because it means we are producing the aircraft. We’re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised €1.5bn”.\nBut then the money ran out.\nLilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth €100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.\nIn early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.\nFor the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.\nThe VX4 recently completed successful take-off and landing tests The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.\nIts striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft-style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be “100 times” safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.\nThe company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.\nBut there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.\nIn May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.\nAmbitions remain sky-high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year and to be breaking even in cash terms.\nYet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand – but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.\nHopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.\nHe has offered to invest $75m into the business – and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.\nSources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.\nCityAirbus has an 80km range and can fly at 120 kmh Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.\nHe says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.\nCalled the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.\n“This is a technology project for their engineers, and they’ve got the money, and they’ve got the know-how,” says Mr Fehrm.\nElsewhere in the world, other well-funded start-ups stand a good chance of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.\nOnce the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there’s a profitable market for them.\nThe first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?\n“The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,” points out Mr Fehrm.\nGiven all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.\n“No one wanted to miss out on the next Tesla,” laughs Mr Fehrm.",

    "text": "Nvidia Warns Against Biden's AI Chip Export Limit Proposal\n[Addison Perry](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79055)Updated: 01-10-2025 12:21 AM\nNvidia Voices Concerns Over Proposed AI Chip Restrictions\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently expressed its disapproval of a proposed strategy by the current U.S. administration to impose new restrictions on the export of AI chips. The company, renowned for its cutting-edge technology in graphics processing units and AI, fears that such measures would hamper the U.S. economy and benefit competing nations.\nSignificance of AI Chip Exports\nThe AI chip market is crucial for sustaining technological advancements globally. Nvidia's Vice President, Ned Finkle, stated that the potential policy shift could seriously impact technological progress both domestically and abroad. He emphasized that placing limits on chip exports may ignite a race among rival nations for technological advancement and alternative solutions.\nThe Danger of Preemptive Measures\nFinkle conveyed a message urging the outgoing president not to enact policies that may hinder the incoming administration's plans. He highlighted the negative ramifications that such a restrictive policy could bring to the American economy. The concern is that actions taken now may create hurdles for subsequent administrations, effectively complicating the regulatory landscape.\nReported Plans and Industry Reactions\nDetails from recent reports suggest that the U.S. Commerce Department and the White House are contemplating new measures aimed at preventing adversaries from acquiring advanced technology. This initiative aims to curb the military advancement of nations like China by regulating AI chip exports.\nGlobal Market Implications\nThe anticipated regulations reportedly include a broader framework that could impede a range of countries from accessing U.S. technology. This broad brush approach worries many in the industry, including influential organizations such as the Information Technology Industry Council. These groups represent a diverse constituency, including major players like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ: META), all of which could be adversely affected.\nConcerns Over Competitive Edge\nThe critique from industry leaders suggests that such restrictive measures might not only limit U.S. companies' abilities to thrive in global markets but might inadvertently enhance the competitiveness of foreign firms. Without access to advanced U.S. technologies, foreign entities might pivot towards developing their own solutions, widening the gap in AI advancement.\nNvidia’s Stock Performance\nOn the heels of the Bloomberg report regarding the proposed AI chip export regulations, Nvidia's stock saw a drop of over 1% during after-hours trading. This reaction speaks volumes about market sentiments and investor confidence amid these uncertainties.\nCalls for a Balanced Approach\nIndustry experts emphasize the necessity for a balanced approach that promotes innovation and collaboration while also protecting national interests. It is crucial for policymakers to consider the interconnectedness of global markets and the implications of creating barriers to trade.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat did Nvidia criticize about the Biden administration's plan?\nNvidia criticized the possible restrictions on AI chip exports, expressing concern that such measures could harm the U.S. economy and technological leadership.\nHow might AI chip export limits affect global technology?\nExport limits could push countries to seek alternative technologies, potentially weakening the global market position of U.S. tech companies.\nWhat impact would these regulations have on U.S. companies?\nThe potential regulations might restrict U.S. companies' ability to sell their products internationally, allowing foreign competitors to gain an advantage.\nHow did Nvidia's stock respond to the news?\nFollowing the reports of proposed export regulations, Nvidia's stock price fell by over 1% in after-hours trading.\nWhat do industry leaders suggest regarding these policies?\nIndustry leaders advocate for a balanced approach that safeguards national interests without stifling innovation and international collaboration.\nAbout Investors Hangout\n[Investors Hangout](https://investorshangout.com/) is a leading online stock forum for financial discussion and learning, offering a wide range of free tools and resources.

    "text": "YAOUNDÈ, Cameroon – After the Chief Rabbi of South Africa posted a social media video accusing Pope Francis of “colluding with the forces of evil” for his stance on the war between Israel and Hamas, the country’s bishops have pushed back, insisting the claims “lack truth and objectivity and have an air of mistrust and character assassination.”\nThe bishops also asserted that while both the Holocaust and the surprise Hamas attacks on Israel of Oct. 7 were “barbaric” and must be prevented from happening again, “these events should not be used to silence and paralyze friends from being critical of the Israeli Army’s inhumane and unlawful acts in this present war.”\nChief Rabbi Warren Goldstein posted the video on YouTube Dec. 19, responding to a late November report in the Washington Post regarding a phone conversation between Pope Francis and Israeli President Isaac Herzog in which the pontiff allegedly said “it is forbidden to respond to terror with terror.”\nGoldstein said the pope’s remarks meant he was placing Israel on the same level as Hamas.\n“In comparing Israel’s just war of self-defense to the barbarism of Hamas, Pope Francis repeats the sins of Pope Pius XII from the Nazi era of surreptitiously supporting the forces of evil who seek to annihilate the Jewish people and betrays his fiduciary duty as the head of the Catholic Church to protect Christians throughout the world from the same murderous hatred directed against the Jews, not realizing that we are in this war together,” Goldstein said in the video.\nHe accused the pope of what he described as “primitive pacifism,” and suggested that the pontiff’s position could actually lead to more suffering.\n“Pope Francis, God has given you an historic opportunity to atone for the sins of Pope Pius and the Catholic Church during the Holocaust,” Goldstein said. “Your church and predecessor stood by while the first Holocaust was perpetrated, and now there are forces that seek a second holocaust.”\n“Yet you have never used your powerful moral voice to condemn Iran for all of this,” Goldstein said. “You have never publicly opposed Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, which we all know it intends to use to exterminate Israel. Pope Francis… you must not stand by as a passive bystander like Pope Pius did during the first holocaust, while Iran seeks to perpetrate a second one and one of the ways that Iran seeks to exterminate Israel is through its proxy army, Hamas.”\nAs of this writing, the video had drawn 116,000 views. In response, the Southern Africa Catholic Bishops Conference\nIn response, the Southern African Catholic Bishops published a Dec. 23 open letter signed by Bishop Sithembele Anton Sipuka of Umtata, South Africa, president of the conference, in which the bishops emphasized both the long-standing relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people, and Pope Francis’s own personal commitment to dialogue and cooperation.\n“Given the renewed religious dialogue with the Jewish people and the diplomatic relationship that exists between the Catholic Church and the State of Israel, your public attack on the pope is regrettable,” the bishops’ statement said.\n“The emotions with which you uttered these statements suggest that you believe that the Pope hates Jews, hence you call him to repent, [but] nothing could be further from the truth. Pope Francis began his papacy by visiting Israel in 2014. During that journey, he expressed joy about Catholics and Jews being ‘bound by a very special spiritual bond,’ pledging to work to advance ‘the progress there has been in relations between Jews and Catholics since the Second Vatican Council in a spirit of renewed collaboration,’” they said.\nThe SACBC defended the Pope’s stance on the war in Gaza, saying that he was not condoning terrorism but condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by Israel, which, they said, has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties, mostly women and children.\nThe SACBC said that the Pope was not anti-Israel, but pro-peace and pro-justice, and that he had shown his solidarity and compassion for the victims of violence on both sides.\n“When the atrocious attack, murder and abduction of innocent Israeli citizens by Hamas occurred on the 7th of October, Pope Francis clearly and unambiguously condemned it. He personally received some members of families of abducted Israelis by Hamas.”\n“Pope Francis is not anti-Semite, and neither is the Catholic Church anti-Semitic. He is a friend to the Jewish people and Israel,” the bishops said.\nThe SACBC challenged Goldstein’s assertion that the Israeli Army has done more to minimize civilian casualties than any army in history, citing the reports of shelling schools, hospitals, refugee camps, homes, mosques and churches in Gaza, and blocking humanitarian aid. The SACBC said that these actions could not be justified by the criteria of a just war, and that Israel had no moral right to engage in such conduct.\nThe SACBC also lamented the recent attack on a Catholic church and a convent in Gaza, where two women were killed by an Israeli Army sniper, and several others were injured by mortar fire. The SACBC said that this attack was an example of the brutality and injustice that the pope was denouncing, and that it contradicted Goldstein’s portrayal of Israel as largely innocent.\nThe SACBC concluded its letter by criticizing Goldstein’s description of the pope’s desire to see a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine as a “betrayal” of the Jewish people.\nThe SACBC said that the pope’s desire was in line with the international consensus and the legitimate aspirations of both peoples, and that it was not a threat to the existence or security of Israel, but a guarantee of peace and stability in the region.\nThe bishops also offered to meet Goldstein personally to further the discussion.",

    "text": "'He cared about people': Milwaukee businesses reflect on Herb Kohl's patronage MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- The Milwaukee County Historical Society is honoring the life of Herb Kohl this week after his [passing on Wednesday,](https://www.cbs58.com/news/herb-kohl-former-bucks-owner-and-us-senator-dies-at-age-88) illuminating his name in their window with historic city hall lights. Part of what made Herb Kohl special figure in Wisconsin was his pride for Milwaukee, and his love for locals. Many folks met the senator over the years, and shared conversations with him at different places across the city. \"He was very humble, and he wasn't very flashy,\" said Joseph Klosowski, manager at Ma Fischer's diner. That's how locals who encountered former senator and Bucks owner remember him. \"He was very personable, even though he was kind of quiet,\" said Michael Price, co-owner of Benji's Deli in Shorewood. Kohl was a regular at several spots across the Milwaukee area. During his time with the Bucks, he went to the Milwaukee Athletic Club every day. \"He was a swimmer. He loved to come in and swim,\" said member services director, Brad Schendel. As a longtime employee, Schendel got to know Kohl well. \"I mentioned to him that I was going to Washington D.C., and he said when I get there to give him a call, so I did that, and he arranged with him a private tour of the US Capitol,\" Schendel recalled. Another daily stop: Ma Fischer's diner on Milwaukee's east side. \"He would come in early in the morning, like 4:00 a.m., or later on in the evening, but every day,\" Klosowski said. The manager recalls Kohl would always order a chopped salad or French toast. \"He'd always end it with a scoop of ice cream and some chocolate syrup,\" Klosowski remembered. He also invested in young employees' futures. \"For a lot of the servers he'd write letters of recommendation, or things for getting into grad school,\" the manager said. Until just weeks ago, you could find Kohl almost every Saturday at Benji's deli in Shorewood. Above all, the owner says Kohl was consistent. \"He always ordered the same thing, a hot dog and fries,\" co-owner Michael Price said. \"Herb basically wore the same coat, the same outfit, every time I saw him.\" While quiet, he was always willing to make conversation. \"He would eat, and then he would usually get up, and he'd go around to people, shake hands, and say hi,\" Price said. \"Obviously he cared about the city, he cared about Milwaukee, he cared about people,\" Schendel said. Other spots Kohl frequented were Miss Katie's Diner, and Zaffiro's pizza on Farwell. All employees who talked with CBS 58 remembered him fondly, saying he treated everyone like they were important.",
