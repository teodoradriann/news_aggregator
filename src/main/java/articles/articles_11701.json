    "text": "As it is rightly said, data is the lifeblood of any organization in the digital landscape. Businesses depend heavily on data to make data-driven informed decisions. Have you ever wondered how businesses can ensure that data quality is up to mark and meets required standards? Ensuring the quality and accuracy of data is paramount. How convenient would it be if we could determine the source, pathway, and destination of data, that is having access to the complete history of the data? This is where the concept of Data Lineage comes in! Data lineage is a process of tracking the flow of data, offering a holistic and clear view of data flow from source to destination and what data changes had been there in between. Understanding Data Lineage Better To understand data lineage better, compare it with a map, which directs the users step by step on what direction to take to reach the destination. Similarly, data lineage is a GPS but for data. It facilitates various stakeholders to make better decisions by having the complete history of data. Why Does Data Lineage Matter? Let's Witness Why There Is a Need for Data Lineage- To improve data literacy and observability, Dependency of Various Stakeholders In order to perform tasks supremely well, data management and IT professionals must have to understand data patterns and the history of the data, as it serves as a foundation for further activities to carry on. Technical and operational metadata, impact and root-cause analysis along data chains, and impact analysis, all require a clear understanding of data lineage. Fulfilling Regulatory Compliance Requirement By offering a comprehensive view of data movement, storage, and transformation, data lineage helps organizations to check who has access to data, and what data changes have been made over time, overall offering a complete record of the data pathway. This proactive approach helps in identifying potential risks associated with data alterations. Moreover, during compliance auditing and documentation, following data lineage can offer insights to regulators to ensure adherence to regulatory compliances. To Boost Transparency by Enhancing Data Quality and Integrity To ensure that data is trustworthy, accurate, and aligned with business objectives, data lineage helps maintain data quality throughout its pipeline by offering a transparent view of the data. By tracking the flow of data, organizations can identify and address data-related quality issues. To Identify Debugs and Troubleshooting Errors It’s of utmost importance to identify debugs and errors at an early stage, to ensure that decisions are made of accurate and reliable data. Data lineage can identify inconsistencies, troubleshooting errors, and anomalies in the data, to help developers track changes and go back to the previous version of data if an error occurs after the alteration in the data. To Better Manage Data-Related Risks Data lineage simplifies risk management by offering insights regarding how data is transformed across the organization. Understanding the lineage of critical data facilitates organizations to eliminate or better tackle data breaches, misuse, and data loss. Such practice enables the implementation of appropriate security measures to protect confidential data. Making Data Suitable for Business Intelligence and Analytics It would not be wrong to say that today every organization wants to know the analytics for obvious reasons, that is to land on smarter decision-making. For this purpose, data lineage is essential for business intelligence and analytics to act upon and ensure that decisions are based on statistics and analytics rather than gut instinct. Summing Up From the above need for data lineage, it's evident that having a comprehensive knowledge of data flow is of utmost importance to crack the decision-making game. It serves as a backbone for propelling trust and transparency in your data by understanding the journey of the data. In a nutshell, knowing data through data lineage is the need of the hour to address data-related risks and issues.

    "text": "Le 24h (o poco meno) di Kevin Danso a Roma . Succede anche questo nel calciomercato . Sarebbe dovuto essere la colonna portante della formazione di Daniele De Rossi e, invece, dopo “lunghe interpretazione” in fase di visite mediche, il difensore austriaco non ha superato le visite mediche. “Una decisione irritante e incomprensibile “, il commento del calciatore del Lens.\nLeggi Anche Calciomercato, trattative e news di oggi 30 agosto: Osimhen-Al Ahli, operazione in chiusura Le visite confermano la non idoneità\nAndiamo con ordine. Nei giorni scorsi, la Roma e il Lens avevano raggiunto un accordo per il difensore austriaco Kevin Danso: la società giallorossa avrebbe dovuto sborsare 22 milioni di euro più tre di bonus. Atterrato in Italia, Danso ha svolto le visite mediche di rito . Le ore passano e a Roma, sponda Trigoria, regna il silenzio. Poi, la notizia: “Il calciatore non ha superato l’idoneità sportiva “. Dietrofront dei giallorossi e pista abbandonata: al suo posto ecco Tiago Djalo dalla Juventus.\nIl comunicato ufficiale del Lens\n“In seguito a trattative serrate con la Roma, Kevin Danso non si unirà al club della lupa . La lunga interpretazione di una visita medica è stata la causa di questo trasferimento interrotto . Il club si interroga sulle ragioni di fondo del mancato via libera a questo movimento, per un giocatore attentamente monitorato che disputa stagioni con più di 30 partite sia sui campi francesi che internazionali”. Dunque, Danso lascia Roma per tornare forzatamente in Francia: “Il Lens mantiene la massima fiducia nel suo difensore, che avrà piacere di rivedere domani e che sarà sottoposto ad un protocollo adeguato prima di vestire nuovamente i colori oro e rosso”.\nLe parole di Danso\n“Sono deluso e arrabbiato per il corso dei giorni scorsi e per il mancato trasferimento all’AS Roma “. Il difensore austriaco non nasconde la propria amarezza per quella che sarebbe dovuta essere una nuova (e prima) esperienza in Italia: “Soprattutto, sono molto sorpreso dal presunto motivo della cancellazione del trasferimento . Sia i medici della nazionale austriaca che il reparto medico del Lens mi hanno accompagnato da vicino negli ultimi anni e mi hanno regolarmente esaminato . L’ultima volta che sono stato controllato a Lens era all’inizio della stagione. Non è mai stata rilevata alcuna criticità . Ecco perché le interpretazioni della visita medica a Roma sono molto irritanti per il mio ambiente, per me per niente comprensibili . Discuterò ora la mia situazione con i responsabili di Lens e OFB e mi preparerò per ciò che mi attende”.\nLeggi Anche Serie A, il calendario della terza giornata – Gli orari delle partite e dove vederle in tv e streaming (Dazn, Sky)\nAs Roma Serie A Articolo Precedente Ti ricordi… quando la Premier League stava per fallire e la Serie A salvò i top club dal baratro Articolo Successivo Atalanta e Zaniolo, Gasperini ha già perso la pazienza: “Una scommessa persa.

This is not entirely unexpected, as Apple has a history of reusing core technology across multiple generations of its S-series chips.The S6, S7, and S8 chips, for exmaple, all shared the same fundamental architecture.\nThe S9 and S10 chips are built with two “Sawtooth” performance cores, similar to those in the A16 Bionic chip. Despite the older tech, this architecture delivers ample power for a wrist-worn device, offering a 64-bit dual-core processor, a 4-core Neural Engine, second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) support, and 64GB of storage.\nWhile the",

    "title": "Lefties Are Becoming Even More UNGLUED ! Molly Jong-Fast Says Trump Will Put Her in a Camp If Elected",
    "text": "We hope you are ready for the Left to get even more hysterically delusional as we approach the election. With less than two weeks to go, the Democrats have fallen back on the worn out 'TRUMP IS HITLER' card and allegations of groping. Both of those stories seem to have backfired. [No one is buying Trump is Hitler](https://twitchy.com/samj/2024/10/24/fuzzychimp-thread-trump-hitler-n2402666), and the [allegations of groping fell apart under basic scrutiny](https://twitchy.com/samj/2024/10/24/annnd-the-model-claiming-trump-groped-her-story-from-31-years-ago-falls-apart-n2402673). So the next step is to crank up the crazy to eleven. New in PN: — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar)[@MollyJongFast]on why living in a blue state won't save you \"If we are the 'enemy within,' that means we go to the camps too.\"[https://t.co/wx2lveHeRl][October 24, 2024] Molly blocked this writer on X, [but she can still read her drivel](https://www.publicnotice.co/p/molly-jong-fast-interview-trump-2024): Donald Trump often asks prospective voters, “What do you have to lose?” The answer, to hear Molly Jong-Fast tell it, is quite a bit — and that goes for everyone. “Trump is telling us all about his potential plans: internment camps, going after his enemies foreign and domestic, including, presumably, journalists,” she recently [wrote]in Vanity Fair. “Will I be one of them? Will he clamp down on the free press? Will he take away the licenses from networks he deems insufficiently supportive of his presidency?”Jong-Fast lives in New York City, but being in a blue state might not spare you. Trump isn’t hiding that he plans to abuse his power by weaponizing the federal government against his foes in unprecedented ways, and this time there will be no guardrails. Sigh. None of this is true. Even the words 'a', 'and', and 'the' are lies. Donald Trump -- well, Mike Pence -- was going to put gays in camps. Remember that? Never happened. The rest is all pure projection. There's no way SCOTUS, even with all Trump's appointees, lets him violate the First Amendment. But we get it. Jong Fast is a Democrat. Their presidents have put people in camps. The replies are a whole boatload of crazy: Aaron, — Keith (@keithl_33)[@MollyJongFast]couldnt be more correct here. If Trump is ever allowed to hold the presidency, we will see hundreds of millions of Americans dead by mid February 2025. This is a fact and voters need to understand that[October 24, 2024] Egads. If you vote Trump in he could — Patriot (@susan_patriot) -end Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid -end overtime pay & unions -give tax breaks to the rich -draft our young for immigrant control, protests & arresting his foes. -etc. You couldn't protest or vote him out. He plans absolute power/dictatorship.[October 24, 2024] None of this is true. It didn't happen in 2016, it won't happen in 2024. Let's get back to sanity, shall we? This is all a fever dream in your heads... — Beers and Baseball ⚡🐊 (@BeersandBasebal)[October 24, 2024] It sure is. Libs really believe this s**t? Lol — Jim Muessig (@JimMuessig)[October 24, 2024] They sure do. Again, here are progressives projecting a fake fear but in reality is something they would love to do if in power. — Ohio Hog Fan (@ohiomanblotter)[October 24, 2024] Of course. Hillary Clinton herself said MAGA voters need 'reprogramming.' Guys - Trump is NOT this competent. Seriously, go touch grass. — John 🗽 (@ITVPod)[October 24, 2024] The Left like to say Trump is a moron. Morons don't put reporters in camps. Are you just now discovering that Molly is retarded? Because we've known that for a while. — Eric Spencer (@JustEric)[October 24, 2024] [She's the same moron who said J.D. Vance -- married to an Indian-American with biracial children -- only wants white kids in America](https://twitchy.com/amy-curtis/2024/07/30/molly-jong-fast-says-vance-only-wants-white-children-in-america-n2399039), so this tracks. Don’t worry. We’ll power the camps with wind farms and make sure they serve insect stew everyday. — SτξΜ Smittie GE.D (@smittie61984)[October 24, 2024] It'll be the utopia the Left wants for the rest of us! You should order some socks and a nice pair of cross-trainers for the forced marches. — Grateful Calvin (@shoveitjack) It will be bad enough for you without adding foot blisters.[https://t.co/R65DHfHHtE][October 24, 2024] Good socks are key. I was promised this would happen in his term and yet — Mary 🎃 Spooky Ginger 👻 (@mchastain81)[@GayPatriot]IS STILL ON THE LOOSE. 😡[https://t.co/l0hhgc1rZ7][October 24, 2024] Aaaand we're dead. I don't have a vote in this election, but as an engineer who stands to benefit the more large construction projects get approved, I'm excited about the prospect of a gulag system capable of holding and re-educating half the US population. Time to update my revenue forecasts. — Tim Newman (@whitesundesert)[https://t.co/pXRgRD4sET][October 24, 2024] See? Trump will improve the economy already! Blue state dems know that counseling is available, right? — Arthur Boreman (yes, that Arthur Boreman) (@ArthurBoreman)[https://t.co/JubFYdo7lT][October 24, 2024] There are not enough counselors to handle this level of crazy.",

    "title": "Extreme Weather Changes Put Pressure on Animals And Plants in UK | Nature World News",
    "text": "Climate change is putting pressure on animals and plants in the United Kingdom due to rising average temperatures, shifting seasons, and increasingly unpredictable weather, according to the National Trust's annual report. Effects of Extreme Weather on Animals And Plants The conservation charity said the changing weather patterns, notably the rising temperatures, are upsetting nature and the regular rhythm of the seasons. This lack of predictability disrupts animal behavior in particular, but it can also have an influence on trees and plants. The National Trust listed a long number of species that have perished in the past year, including oak trees, which are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the oak processionary moth's caterpillars, which infest them. Because of a lack of extended cold spells in recent years, the moths have moved northward from their natural Mediterranean environment. Because of the milder winters, hibernators such as dormice are waking up too early and depleting crucial energy stores. It is also causing red deer rutting to occur later, resulting in calves being born in the summer rather than the spring, with inadequate time to mature and store fat stores for survival. According to the trust, some of the rare lichens and liverworts that thrive in the temperate rainforest at Lydford Gorge, on the outskirts of Dartmoor in Devon, died last winter due to a lack of water. When the severe rains arrived, water voles were driven from their burrows, putting them at risk of cold, hunger, and predation. \"These baseline changes that we're seeing are really worrying and what we should be taking more notice of, particularly when combined with extreme weather events, which makes things even more challenging,\" said [Ben McCarthy](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/climate-change-has-caused-chaos-for-uk-nature-in-2023/ar-AA1m4rwy), the head of nature and restoration ecology at the National Trust.

McCarthy stressed they want to see parties commit to accelerating work on [environment restoration](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/27/weather-changes-causing-chaos-for-uk-flora-and-fauna-says-national-trust-audit?fbclid=IwAR2fFylsllOEFooj-_6fyA_k9Jc5x8IRevRkyVMdOTn5mBSuY6UFizdNixI), expanding support for nature-based climate change solutions, and putting climate adaptation at the core of their manifestos so that the UK is better prepared for the increasing weather extremes. \"We need to see more action from politicians, particularly as we enter this election year, to ensure tackling the nature and climate crisis is a top priority,\" he added. The [National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/) has been working on programs to make the landscape more robust and adaptable to changing seasons, warning that we must be prepared for this \"new norm.\" However, the audit revealed some rays of hope, with a record-breaking number of Cornish Chough birds identified this year, a 60% rise over the previous year, having previously been extinct in Cornwall. Beavers in Somerset welcomed their first kits, welcoming in twins and expanding the beaver community on the Holnicote Estate. Moreover, despite heavy rain from Storm Babet damaging four of the beavers' dams, the family was quick to begin repairs due to their hardworking attitude.
