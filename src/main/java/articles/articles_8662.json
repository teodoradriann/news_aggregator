The latest updates from August 21 indicate that Ukrainian forces are facing severe pressure, with numerous attacks from Russian troops aimed at capturing this strategically crucial city.\nAccording to Ukrainian military sources, 46 Russian attacks were launched around Pokrovsk on that day. Out of these, 44 were repelled, though two continued into the evening. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that 238 Russian soldiers were either killed or wounded in the area, but there were no figures available on Ukrainian casualties.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that the military is reinforcing its defenses around Pokrovsk, which remains one of the most active conflict zones in the Donetsk region. Despite these efforts, The Economist suggests that Russia is nearing a successful capture of the city, which could potentially shift the momentum of the conflict.\nPokrovsk, which has a population of around 59,000, has been a frontline city since the beginning of the war, but its situation has become increasingly dire in the past month. Russia's aim to capture Pokrovsk is part of its broader strategy to advance towards major cities like Dnieper and Zaporizhzhia.\nIn response to the escalating threat, the local administration and regional police are implementing emergency measures. Two supermarkets have closed, and more are expected to follow. Residents are rushing to complete their errands and evacuate the city. The scene is chaotic, with people hurriedly packing their belongings, including essential household items.\nThe recent Ukrainian withdrawals from Avdiivka and the challenges faced in neighboring Ocheretyne have set the stage for Russia's advance on Pokrovsk. The city is now within 10 kilometers of Russian forces. The atmosphere in Pokrovsk is tense, with the sound of crying children and the clamor of evacuation preparations filling the air. CNN also reports that some parents are hiding their children to avoid mandatory evacuation orders from local authorities.\nWe need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria!

    "text": "VegNews Guides Cooking\nLazy Cat Kitchen\nUse a Bamboo Steamer for Easy, Healthy, and Super Tasty Meals In a world of high-tech appliances, the bamboo steamer holds its own. Here’s how to use a bamboo steamer for healthy, delicious meals. by Tanya Flink\nNovember 7, 2024\nShare this\nEvery year or so, a new kitchen appliance becomes the “it” gift. Food culture has obsessed over Instapots, air fryers, and pizza ovens, and while these gadgets have their uses, we’re bringing it back to the basics. Like, 5,000 years ago basics, according to Irvin Lin of Serious Eats and other food historians. The humble bamboo steamers—or early adaptations of it—has been around for thousands of years, and like today’s modern cooking tools, its uses are incredibly versatile.\nWhether you want to heat up frozen vegan dumplings or savor a basketful of perfectly steamed vegetables, here’s what you need to know about bamboo steamers.\nChoosing the right bamboo steamer A bamboo steamer is fairly straightforward—you don’t have to worry about buying the best, most efficient, or easiest-to-clean brand. They all reliably perform the same function.\nOmni Foods\nRELATED: 15 Vegan Ways to Cook Butternut Squash\nThe main differentiator between steamers is the size. Bamboo steamers can range in diameter from six to over 14 inches and come in multiple tiers. For most home cooks, Margaret Egby of Food and Wine recommends a 10-inch, two- or three-tier model. You want a steamer that will fit in a skillet with room to spare; so, if your largest skillet is only 10 inches wide, you may want to downsize to an eight- or six-inch steamer.\nYou can find bamboo steamers at a variety of homegoods stores including Sur La Table, William Sanoma, and most department stores.\nHow to use a bamboo steamer This appliance isn’t automated, but that doesn’t mean it’s not easy to use. We learned the basics from the Leung family, the homecooks behind The Woks of Life . “Steaming is not only a great way to cook food, it’s also a great way to reheat. Because steaming reintroduces moisture into food, it can be a great way to make your food fresh once again,” they write on their blog.\nBefore you start steaming, you’ll need water, parchment paper or breathable material to line the steamer with, and a wide, shallow pan that is slightly larger than your steamer.\nGetty\nOnce your food is prepped and ready to start steaming, lightly simmer some water in the pan so the water level covers the bottom ½ inch of your steamer. Essentially, you want enough water to prevent the bottom of the steamer from burning, but it should not be so high as to reach the first level of your steamer (and therefore waterlog your food).\nBefore placing the food into the steamer, you’ll need to line the surface to prevent sticking. Parchment paper works well, as do more natural items like wide cabbage or lotus leaves. In a pinch, you can even use cupcake liners if you’re steaming dim sum like bao buns or dumplings.\nPlace the food on the liner and make sure the top of the steamer is closed. Most foods steam relatively quickly—less than 15 minutes—so keep close and top off the water in the pan if the level gets too low or you notice any scorching on the bottom of the steamer.\nCanva\nBECOME A VEGNEWS VIP : Get exclusive product deals, freebies, and perks galore!\nWhen you’re ready to remove the food, turn off the heat on the stove and carefully transfer the steamed items onto a plate or serving dish using chopsticks or another utensil. The food will be extremely hot, so avoid using your hands and curb the temptation to take a bite immediately—patience is a delicious virtue.\nTo clean your steamer, remove from the pan and wash with a gentle sponge and dish soap (do not leave your steamer to soak). Immediately rinse off the soap and leave on the counter for a day or two before storing—this helps prevent mold or mildew from forming.\nWhat to cook with a bamboo steamer A bamboo steamer may only do one thing (steam), but its uses are wide and varied. From reheating frozen foods to making dessert, here are six ways to use this simple appliance.\nDamduone\n1 Frozen foods For those with a freezer full of Trader Joe’s frozen kimbab, Costco veggie dumplings, or any of Omni’s bao buns, a bamboo steamer is essential. Steaming helps achieve the perfect cook and texture—something a microwave can’t get quite right. Follow the steaming instructions on the package and make sure to line your steamer.\nWayfair\n2 Vegetables Steamed vegetables are anything but bland when cooked to the right consistency and seasoned with a simple sauce. While a bamboo steamer can cook just about anything, we love using it for veggies that can be sliced thin and cooked quickly like eggplant, kabocha squash, and bok choy. The cooking time will depend on how thick the vegetables are, but as a rule of thumb, check for fork-tenderness every few minutes and know that heartier veggies like squash, carrots, and onions tend to take longer than leafy greens like cabbage and bok choy. After steaming, drizzle with soy sauce, Korean barbecue sauce, or a nutty sesame marinade\nImpossible Foods\n3 Dim sum Bamboo steamers are a must for dumplings, bao buns, and xiao long bao . With a multi-level steamer, you can have several items going at once—think shumai on the top, barbecue pork buns on the bottom, and vegetable dumplings in the middle. Check out these traditional dim sum recipes or take a deep dive into the delicious variety of dumplings.\nGetty\n4 Tofu and other proteins For the tofu purists, steaming tofu helps retain its soft, silky texture, ready to take on any delectable sauce you pair with it. You can steam the entire block as-is or cut into cubes or slabs (the cut tofu will steam more quickly than the solid block). Both marinated and plain seitan can also be cooked in a bamboo steamer.\nLazy Cat Kitchen\n5 Buns Soft, pillowy buns with a savory filling make for an exquisite meal. Lazy Cat Kitchen ’s vegan sticky pork buns are a go-to for us, but when we’re in the mood for a snack, we also turn to scallion buns. Unlike most buns, these aren’t filled; the impossibly soft, pillowy bread is truly the star of the show. The simple dough is layered with a generous portion of chopped scallions, artfully twisted into a ball, then steamed. They may look complex, but this recipe does a great job of explaining each fold, cut, and twist.\nCook Like Asian\n6 Desserts Taro xiao long bao and chocolate-filled buns are popular options when it comes to steamed desserts, but you can also steam cakes in a trusty bamboo steamer. We look to the traditional Malaysian treat— ma lai go —for reference. It’s a lightly sweetened, unfrosted cake cooked entirely in a bamboo steamer.

    "title": "Будет ли большая война между Израилем и Ираном",
    "text": "Что просходит между Израилем и Ираном, и будет ли большая война?\nВчера и сегодня многие западные СМИ со ссылкой на источники написали, что Израиль готовится нанести удар по ядерным объектам Ирана в ближайшие несколько дней.\nА США начали вывозить своих дипломатов, а также семьи военных, со стран Ближнего Востока. Речь об Ираке (в частности, иракском Курдистане), Бахрейне и Кувейте. Хотя пока выезд ведется в добровольном порядке - то есть, об авральной эвакуации речи не идет.\nВ Центральном командовании США, которое курирует Ближний Восток, заявили о растущей напряженности в регионе, а глава Центрального командования Майкл Курилла отменил свое сегодняшнее выступление перед Сенатом.\nОбострение ситуации эксперты и СМИ связывают, во-первых, с заявлением Ирана 2 июня о создании полного ядерного цикла. Во-вторых, с заявлением МАГАТЭ о том, что Тегеран накопил 400 кг высокообогащенного (60%) урана, что, теоретически, открывает ему путь к созданию ядерной бомбы (для одной боеголовки необходимо иметь 42 кило урана, хотя и обогащенного до уровня в 90%, на что ещё потребуется время). В-третьих, с пробуксовкой переговоров США и Ирана по ядерной программе.\nНакануне президент США Трамп в подкасте газеты New York Post заявил, что стал \"гораздо менее уверен в том, что сделка будет заключена\".\n\"С ними что-то случилось, но я гораздо менее уверен в том, что сделка будет заключена… Кажется, они (иранцы - Ред.) тянут время, и я думаю, что это позор, но сейчас я менее уверен, чем был бы пару месяцев назад\", - сказал Трамп.\nНапомним, в рамках этой сделки США требовали, чтобы Иран прекратил обогащение урана в целом и отказался от владения установками. Тегеран этого делать не хочет и предлагает снизить уровень обогащения до \"гражданского\" под контролем экспертов в обмен на снятие санкций (то есть, по сути, вернуться к ядерной сделке времен Обамы 2015 года).\nНа данном этапе условия, предлагаемые Трампом, как считают в Иране, хуже, чем соглашение десятилетней давности, и сомневаются в успешности переговоров. Напомним, именно Трамп во время своего первого срока разорвал ядерную сделку с Ираном. Поэтому Тегеран хочет письменных гарантий, что этого не произойдет снова, но Трамп отказывается их давать.\nНа определенным этапе возникла идея привлечь Россию как посредника - она могла бы вывести к себе на хранение запасы высокообогащенного урана из Ирана. О возможности посредничества РФ на прошлой неделе заявлял и Трамп после разговора с Путиным. Но, в каком состоянии находится сейчас эта тема - неизвестно.\nЕще накануне новых переговоров по сделке Израиль, как писали западные медиа, готовился нанести удар по ядерным объектам Ирана. В конце мая телеканал CNN со ссылкой на источники в разведке сообщал, что Тель-Авив ведет подготовку такого удара и проводит учения по нему. Как раз тогда уже пошли заявления, что переговоры зашли в тупик. И сейчас снова возрастают слухи о готовящемся израильском ударе - на этот раз подкрепленные действиями США по вывозу семей военных и дипломатов.\nWashington Post при этом пишет, что Израиль уведомил США о готовности нанести удар по ядерным объектам Ирана, что совпадает с данными американской разведки. Но \"неясно, приняли ли израильские лидеры окончательное решение\", добавляют источники CNN.\nТелеканал сообщает, что в американском руководстве по этому поводу идут \"большие разногласия\", но Трамп, похоже, против войны. По данным источников CNN, он вчера звонил премьеру Израиля Нетаньяху и сказал ему \"прекратить разговоры о нападении на Иран\".\nПри этом Тегеран разработал план реагирования, который включает мгновенную контратаку на Израиль с применением сотен баллистических ракет, сообщает New York Times. Также накануне Тегеран заявил, что ударит по базам США в регионе, если американцы атакуют территорию Ирана.\nВ связи с этим есть две версии о том, что значат последние заявления.\nПервая - Израиль действительно готовится нанести удар по Ирану. Аргументом в пользу этого выступает информация о том, что Тегеран вплотную приблизился к созданию ядерной бомбы, что Израиль воспринимает для себя как экзистенциальную угрозу, которую нужно ликвидировать любым путем.\nВторая - информация о подготовке удара это лишь элемент информационного давления на Тегеран, при этом США войну в реальности начинать не намерены, а без них у одного Израиля не хватит сил уничтожить ядерную программу Ирана (есть, кстати, версия, что не хватит их и у США, так как почти все объекты ядерной программы Ирана находятся глубоко под землей и не пострадают даже в случае ядерного удара). В пользу этой версии говорит и то, что, несмотря на грозные заявления, переговоры с Ираном США все ж таки продолжают. Очередной их раунд пройдёт 15 июня в Маскате.\nО рисках для США большой войны с Ираном мы уже писали. В случае ее начала все американские базы в регионе и флот в Персидском заливе окажутся под ударом. Возможны большие потери. При этом есть сомнения, что у американцев сейчас вообще достаточно сил, чтобы военным путем к чему-либо принудить Тегеран, не говоря уже о его полном разгроме. Даже атака против хуситов, которую Трамп довольно быстро свернул, показала ограниченность военных ресурсов США в регионе. А война с Ираном - многократно более сложная задача. Кроме того, не стоит сбрасывать со счетов и внутриполитический фактор - нарастающие протесты против Трампа. Если на этом фоне Вашингтон ввяжется в тяжелую войну за тридевять земель с большими потерями, то это может дать протестам сильнейший импульс.\nЧто касается влияния на войну в Украине, то любое обострение на Ближнем востоке может максимально отвлечь внимание и военные ресурсы США и минимизировать вероятность продолжения помощи Киеву (СМИ недавно уже писали, что часть оружия, предназначавшего для ВСУ американцы перенаправили на Ближний Восток). Кроме того, если Россия все ж таки будет задействована как посредник, то это станет ещё одним аргументом для Трампа продолжать диалог с Москвой и, как минимум, не ужесточать давление на РФ.\nПодпишитесь на телеграм-канал Политика Страны, чтобы получать ясную, понятную и быструю аналитику по политическим событиям в Украине.",

    "text": "Alcohol-related deaths in England reach record levels\nThere has been a significant increase in alcohol-related deaths in England over the past four years, Azernews reports.\nIn 2023, more than 8,200 people died in England due to alcohol consumption. This represents a 42 percent increase compared to 2019. The highest mortality rates were recorded in the northeastern region of the country.\nIn response to these alarming statistics, the British Alcohol Health Alliance has proposed the introduction of a minimum price per unit of alcohol, similar to the policy implemented in Scotland, in an effort to curb alcohol consumption. Research in Scotland has shown that this policy can effectively reduce alcohol-related harm by making alcohol less affordable, particularly for heavy drinkers.\nThe UK government has labeled the rising death toll as unacceptable, acknowledging the need for stronger measures. Officials indicated that public health priorities would be central to England's 10-year National Health Service (NHS) plan, which is expected to address the country's growing health challenges, including those related to alcohol misuse.\nThe rise in alcohol-related deaths reflects broader public health concerns, including the strain on the NHS, mental health issues, and social problems linked to alcohol abuse. Health experts warn that without significant intervention, the number of alcohol-related deaths could continue to rise, further burdening healthcare systems and communities across England.\nHere we are to serve you with news right now.

    "text": "Un inferno di fiamme, fumo nero e denso altissimo, visibile a chilometri di distanza, accompagnato da un odore nauseabondo a spezzare il respiro. È cominciato pochi minuti dopo le 17, all’interno dell’azienda chimica Chimpex Industriale Spa, ubicata nel consorzio Asi di Caivano, sequestrata dalla Procura di Napoli Nord e affidata a un amministratore giudiziario lo scorso 20 gennaio perché smaltiva le acque di lavorazione direttamente nei Regi Lagni, bypassando il depuratore del consorzio.\nE dopo i danni dell’inquinamento delle acque, ieri l’incendio ha “ vomitato” per decine di chilometri circostanti il sito, chissà quanti e quali veleni, visto che in questa fabbrica i settanta operai, tutti al momento rintracciati, si produce a ritmo continuo solventi di ogni tipo, gel per il disinfettante per le mani, e anche l’Adblu, l’additivo per migliorare gli scarichi dei veicoli con i motori diesel. Un disastro ambientale di proporzioni gigantesche, con la nube tossica, visibile a chilometri di distanza, ha interessato a secondo della direzione del venti, un fallout di sostanze inquinanti oltre che su Caivano, anche la vicina Marcianise, Acerra, Casalnuovo, Afragola, Crispano, Cardito, Casoria e sfiorato i comuni dell’area frattese.\nCentocinquantamila abitanti a ai quali è stato chiesto di non uscire, di chiudere finestre e climatizzatori per evitare di respirare veleni. Il prefetto Filippo Dispensa, che con la viceprefetto Nicoletta Calcaterra e il dirigente Maurizio Alicandro, guida la commissione prefettizia dopo lo scioglimento del consiglio comunale di Caivano, ha disposto per oggi, giovedì 10 aprile, la chiusura di tutte le scuole di Caivano, e invitato la popolazione a non uscire e a non fare uso di prodotti agricoli raccolti della zona.\nAnche don Maurizio Patriciello, parroco del Parco Verde, in un post sulla sua pagina social ha comunicato che la messa vespertina non sarebbe stata celebrata, per salvaguardare la salute dei fedeli. Sul luogo di questo ennesimo disastro ambientale, sono intervenuti dapprima i militari della compagnia di Caivano, diretta dal capitano Antonio Cavallo e i gli agenti della municipale, diretta da Espedito Giglio, che hanno messo in sicurezza la zona, bloccato il traffico e liberate le strade per consentire il rapido intervento di ben tre autobotti dei vigili del fuoco e di alcune ambulanze.\nSul posto anche una squadra del nucleo NBCR (Nucleare, Biologico, Chimico, Radiologico), specializzata in interventi in caso di emergenze causate da sostanze pericolose, mentre l'Arpac ha predisposto l' invio di due laboratori mobili per monitorare il livello di diossine. In particolare, l’intervento dei vigili del fuoco, si è concentrato sulla zona di stoccaggio delle sostanze lavorate, dove sono ubicati sette silos, che stando alle informazioni raccolte sul posto, sono tutti pieni di sostanze ad alta pericolosità esplosiva.\nSolo nella tarda serata, i vigili del fuoco sono riusciti a circoscrivere le fiamme evitando così che il fuoco si propagasse al resto dell’azienda e in particolare nella zona dei silos. Sulle cause, la procura di Napoli Nord ha già aperto un fascicolo, in attesa dei primi risultati e delle verifiche da parte dei vigili del fuoco, che arriveranno solo tra qualche giorno, a incendio spento definitivamente.",
