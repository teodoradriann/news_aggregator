    "text": "(The Center Square)– Some Border Patrol agents will now get increased overtime pay thanks to an amendment pushed by Arizona Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, as well as Republicans and Democrats. The increase put into the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act applies to GS-12 agents who will get 50% more of their \"hourly rate of basic pay or extra ‘half-time’ pay for any hour(s) worked between 81-100 per pay period.\" The boost is in addition to their normal hourly rate, the National Border Patrol Council explained in a [statement](https://bpunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NBPC-Message-re-OT-Pay-NDAA-Passage-December-14-2023.pdf). “We’re cutting through Washington’s partisan noise to support Border Patrol agents in their mission to keep Arizonans safe and secure,” Sinema, Chair of the Border Management Subcommittee, said in a statement on Dec. 22. Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly also praised the move as the Tucson Sector is currently dealing with a migrant surge. The sector reported 16,800 apprehensions this week and 19,400 the week prior. “During a crisis when Border Patrol agents are working around the clock to process migrants and secure the border, this will get them the overtime pay they deserve,” Kelly said in a statement. The Border Patrol Union specifically thanked Sinema, Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar, as well as Republican Sen. James Lankford and Republican Rep. James Comer on Dec. 14 when it passed the made its way to President Joe Biden's desk. Biden signed the NDAA into law last Friday. The move comes as authorities at the border struggle with having enough staff to manage the ongoing crisis. In Arizona, the Lukeville Port of Entry remains closed as Customs and Border Protection agents have shifted efforts in the area to handling the flow of migrants crossing illegally. Morale has also been a long-term struggle for the law enforcement agency, as [The Center Square](https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/article_7c41f1ba-c428-11ed-b7dd-434d37b140a1.html) reported in March that 17 Border Patrol agents committed suicide in 2022.",

En la serie histórica difundida por el ministerio, basada también en Sinan, el mayor número de muertes en el período de un año completo se produjo en 2022, cuando alcanzó mil 53 registros, seguido de 2015, con 986 muertes, según ha informado la Agencia de Brasil. También puedes leer: [Jefe de milicia pide ser arrestado por miedo a morir a manos de la Policía Civil](https://www.publimetro.com.mx/noticias/2023/12/27/brasil-jefe-de-milicia-pide-ser-arrestado-por-miedo-a-morir-a-manos-de-la-policia-civil/) Consultado sobre el registro, el Ministerio de Salud ha informado que, ante el aumento previsto de casos, alrededor de 11 mil 700 profesionales de la salud han sido capacitados en 2023 para el manejo clínico, vigilancia y control de arbovirus, que son infecciones causadas por virus transmitidos principalmente por mosquitos. “El Ministerio de Salud invertirá 256 millones de reales (poco más de 895 millones de pesos) en el fortalecimiento de la vigilancia de las arbovirosis. Es el momento de intensificar los esfuerzos y las medidas de prevención por parte de todos para reducir la transmisión de enfermedades. Para evitar que los casos sean cada vez más graves, la población debe acudir al servicio de salud más cercano cuando presente los primeros síntomas”, señala la nota. También según la carpeta, el día 21 se incorporó la vacuna contra el dengue al Sistema Único de Salud (SUS), pero en un principio no se utilizará a gran escala, ya que el laboratorio fabricante, Takeda, afirmó que tiene una capacidad restringida para suministrar dosis. La vacunación estará enfocada a la población y a las regiones prioritarias, estando prevista la definición de estrategias de utilización de las dosis disponibles en las primeras semanas de enero.",

    "text": "Kevin Monahan found guilty on all counts in driveway shooting\nAfter two weeks of testimony about the April 15th, 2023 driveway shooting, jurors swiftly found Kevin Monahan guilty in the murder of Kaylin Gillis on Tuesday.\nAfter less than two hours of deliberation, the jury found the 66-year-old guilty of second-degree murder, reckless endangerment, and tampering with evidence.\nJurors concluded that Monahan had acted with a depraved indifference to human life when he fired upon two SUVs and a motorcycle that had mistakenly entered the winding driveway of his rural Hebron home – rejecting the lesser charge of second-degree homicide.\nMonahan’s attorneys Art Frost and Kurt Mausert centered their defense around a claim that Monahan’s 20-gauge shotgun could fire even if the trigger was not pulled.\nMonahan testified that he had fired one warning shot, and that the second shot went off after he tripped on nails protruding from his deck, hitting his gun on the railing.\nSpeaking to reporters after jurors came back, 1st Assistant District Attorney Chris Morris reflected on Monahan’s testimony, when Monahan said he hoped to start some sort of dialogue by firing the first time.\n“My hope with that, and if you were there for cross examination, is that the absurdity of something like that was just patently clear in the room. That you could hear a pin drop if anybody had any thought of actually considering that to be true,” said Morris.\nMorris’ closing arguments lasted more than two hours. He showed jurors photos of shooting targets, after Monahan and his wife, Jinx, testified that Monahan rarely fired his gun.\nThe defense said Monahan could not have fired the second shot because of a decades-old wrist injury, but on cross-examination Morris highlighted that Monahan currently works in construction, and participated in long, high-speed motorcycle races as recently as 2018.\nMoments before returning their verdict the jury asked Judge Adam Michelini for clarification on the difference between manslaughter and homicide, and had testimony re-read to them in which Jinx Monahan said her husband only fired his gun once or twice a year gun to kill groundhogs.\nGillis’ friends who were in the caravan when she was struck in the neck, bleeding to death moments later, took the stand to recount the traumatic events of the evening.\nDuring a post-verdict press conference, District Attorney Tony Jordan thanked the young men and women who testified, saying he hopes the outcome of the trial assuaged any guilt they carry.\n“These kids, you all know, they feel responsible. And because our neighbors in Washington County were willing to get involved, those kids know, or they’ll have the basis to know, that there’s nothing that they did that was wrong,” explained Jordan. “Because, you know, adults tend not to believe kids. And so, it was really nice for them to have people that could say to them, ‘you were right, you did nothing wrong, you were just lost.’”\nMuch of the defense’s case also revolved around a lack of communication between Monahan and the young adults as well as law enforcement. Told that police officers were at his home hours after shooting at the caravan for a noise complaint, prosecutors said Monahan lied and said that he had been asleep since 8:30, and that hunters in the woods behind his home could have caused the disturbance.\nDuring closing arguments, Frost reiterated the defense’s stance that the death was unintentional, echoing his opening statement.\n“I told you in the beginning that when we got here, I would ask you to say two words, ‘not guilty.’ Because this was a terrible accident and you, they jury, have realized that by now,” said Frost.\nIn his own closing argument, Morris said Monahan had lied to the police, suggesting hunters as the source of the noise complaint because he knew they were there over shots fired.\nMonahan, Morris said, did not act out of fear:\n“He acted out of a baser emotion than that, he acted out of anger. That is the only thing that can be inferred from shooting at people within 90 seconds of being in your property,” he said. “These vehicles were in his driveway, they were at his house, interrupting his night, and they were not leaving fast enough. He grabbed his shotgun and intended to make them leave as fast as possible. And he didn’t care if they were hurt or killed, just so long as they left.”\nJordan also hoped the guilty verdict would help heal those hurt by Monahan’s actions.\n“And our hope is today that they can begin to find that little bit of faith and justice that they can begin to move forward, to heal. Because, this is not the end for them, and they have a long road ahead of them and we’re hopeful that this is a part of it.”\nGillis’ death made national headlines amid a string of similar cases. Just days prior to Gillis’ death, 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot dead in Missouri after looking for his brothers at the wrong house.\nSentencing will be March 1st, with Monahan facing 25 years to life. Monahan plans on appealing. The defense filed multiple unsuccessful motions for mistrial throughout the case.\nMonahan’s attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "text": "A las 4:30 horas de este viernes arrancó la votación de obreros de Volkswagen de México, los cuales decidirán si aceptan [el incremento](https://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/puebla/exportaciones-volkswagen-propuesta-de-aumento-salarial/) global de 10.59 por ciento; de no hacerlo, la huelga estallará el 19 de septiembre. Son 7 mil 264 operarios con derecho a voto, de los cuales se estima ya sufragaron 4 mil 600, es decir 63.3 por ciento, pero los resultados se conocerán hasta la noche, ya que el cierre de casillas será a las 6 de la tarde. Durante esta semana, a través de cadenas de whatsapp, los técnicos fueron invitados a votar en contra y colocar las banderas rojinegras para conseguir un aumento directo al salario de por lo menos 10 por ciento. En las cadenas difundidas a través de esa red socia,l también se arguye que los cambios al Contrato Colectivo de Trabajo (CCT) no tienen beneficios para todos porque solo los grupos “K” y “M” romperían el tope salarial, por lo cual la propuesta de [la empresa](https://x.com/Volkswagen_MX) debe ser rechazada.
