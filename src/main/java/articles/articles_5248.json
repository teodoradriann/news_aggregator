    "title": "\"天塌了！吃了一半，不会真是虫子吧\"，知名巧克力品牌回应_手机新浪网",
    "text": "“天塌了！吃了一半，不会真是虫子吧”，知名巧克力品牌回应\n近日，有网友发帖称，其咬开“费列罗”巧克力后发现“白色肉乎圆圈”状不明物，怀疑是虫子。\n对此，4月29日，“费列罗”品牌方面回应记者称，“公司对库存产品、原料、仓库以及生产环节进行排查，未发现霉变生虫等质量隐患。相关情况高度疑似是可可;)脂结晶析出造成的物理性状变化。公司仍在积极联系涉事消费者。”\n网友称在“费列罗”巧克力里发现“肉乎圆圈”不明物。\n4月23日，有消费者发帖称，在“费列罗”巧克力发现“白色圆圈”不明物，“天塌了！吃一半，这肉乎的圆圈是啥啊，密恐犯了，不会真是虫子吧。”\n南都记者注意到，该帖子发出后，不少网友在评论区留言称“此前确实在费列罗巧克力里吃出虫子”“巧克力里的坚果易长虫”。\n此事引发热议后，4月29日，“费列罗”品牌方面回应记者称，“公司高度关注此事，一直在积极设法与涉事消费者取得联系，但尚未收到对方回复。目前社交平台上发布的照片信息量有限，没有关于购买渠道、产品真伪、批次号、生产厂家的任何信息，因此无法进行有针对性的产品质量追溯调查。”\n“费列罗”方面提供的一份回复当中提到，发现相关信息后，公司立即对库存产品、原料、仓库以及生产环节进行细致排查，未发现霉变生虫等质量隐患。\n对于巧克力出现“肉状圈”不明物，“费列罗”在回复中指出，“这高度疑似是巧克力可可脂析出造成的物理性状变化。当巧克力产品存储温度变化较大时，可可脂会发生结晶析出现象，便会在产品上出现类似的白圈，如进行适当加温，相应油脂会融化。该现象仅为巧克力外观变化，没有食品安全风险，也不影响消费者正常食用。”\n公开资料显示，“费列罗”是一家意大利品牌巧克力和糖果产品的制造商，也是世界第二大巧克力生产商和糖果公司，公司旗下拥有“健达巧克力”“榛果威化巧克力”“榛果可可酱”等产品。\n此前报道，费列罗巧克力曾卷入全球多地沙门氏菌疫情。2022年4月15日，国家海关总署在官网发布了通知，提示消费者暂不要通过任何渠道购买费列罗集团比利时阿尔隆（Arlon）工厂生产的部分产品。召回原因是部分产品可能受到沙门氏菌污染。\n同年4月27日，世界卫生组织发布一份疾病暴发新闻报告称，英国此前向世卫组织通报了一例单向伤寒沙门氏菌序列34型感染病例，随后，世卫组织展开调查，发现此次沙门氏菌疫情与比利时费列罗公司工厂出产产品密切相关。而该工厂生产的巧克力产品销售至全球至少113个国家，其中包括中国。\n来源 | 南方都市报、N视频报道\n扬子晚报送福利啦！\n扬子晚报微信继续为大家送上五一假期福利！\n奖品为电影《猎金游戏》兑换码8张！（1人2张，一共4人中奖）\n参与方式：1.关注“扬子晚报”微信公众号\n2.在聊天框里回复：五一快乐\n截止时间：5月5日23：59",

    "title": "Indonesian Aerospace's Black Eagle MALE UAV completes first flight as certification campaign begins | Flight Global",
    "text": "Indigenous 1t surveillance platform completes first sortie as manufacturer begins certification campaign, with government orders contingent on regulatory approval.\nIndonesian Aerospace has conducted a maiden sortie with its Black Eagle unmanned air vehicle (UAV), although a firm order for the type has yet to emerge.\nThe first flight of the indigenously developed medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) UAV took place on 28 July, according to Indonesian Aerospace, also known as PTDI.\nSource: Indonesian Aerospace\nThe sprawling archepelago of Indonesia presents significant surveillance challenges\nThe work marks the first of a series of tests that will continue until the Black Eagle attains “full certification” from Indonesia’s aviation authorities. The company indicates that certification is a prerequisite for any government orders.\n“The test flight serves as a proof of concept for mastering key MALE UAV technologies, including system configuration design, autonomous flight control, and long-range communication systems,” says company technology chief Mohammed Faisal.\n“It lays a critical foundation for future developments aligned with national defence priorities. We extend our appreciation to all team members for their precision and dedication throughout the project.”\nThe flight was conducted from Bandung’s Kertajati airport. Indonesian Aerospace did not provide details of the length of the flight.\nBlack Eagle – ‘Elang Hitam’ in Bahasa Indonesia – was originally rolled out in December 2019, but the programme was suspended in 2022. Applications envisaged at the roll-out included strike, as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). It was developed in conjunction with the country’s National Research and Innovation Agency.\nSource: Indonesian Aerospace\nThe Black Eagle has yet to secure customers\nIndonesian Aerospace makes no mention of a weapons capability in relation to the test campaign but instead focuses on the type’s ISR potential.\nAccording to the company, the 1t Black Eagle will have endurance of 24h and an operational altitude of up to 20,000ft. Military uses include maritime patrol, disaster response, and border monitoring. The aircraft will also have civilian applications.\n“This is more than just a flight test – it is a declaration of Indonesia’s readiness to stand on equal footing with global defence innovators,” adds Faisal.\n“Black Eagle is a strategic foundation for building a self-reliant and competitive national UAV ecosystem.”",

    "text": "SUMMARY In line with the bull run in the broader equity market, PB Fintech’s market capitalisation more than doubled to $4.2 Bn by the end of 2023 from $2 Bn at the end of 2022\nPB Fintech reporting its maiden adjusted EBITDA profitable quarter in Q4 FY23 and targeting net profitability in Q3 FY24 set the stage for the rally in the stock in 2023\nDespite rising competition, the Street is largely bullish on the stock as many brokerages see PB Fintech’s first-mover advantage in the insurtech space helping it sustain its growth\nFOLLOW US FOLLOW US Shares of PB Fintech, the parent entity of insurtech major Policybazaar, became one of the biggest gainers of 2023 on the back of the bull run in the domestic equity market, which resulted in the reversal of fortunes for new-age tech startups after the hammering they got in 2022.\nLike its peers Zomato and RateGain, the fintech player made big gains in the first half of 2023 and also sustained the uptrend for the rest of the year. As per analysts, the stock is on track to continue this rally in the mid to long term.\nOn the back of the uptrend of 2023, PB Fintech’s market capitalisation more than doubled to $4.2 Bn by the end of the year from $2 Bn at the end of 2022. Its shares gained 73% in 2023 versus an almost 50% decline last year.\nSo, what led to the rally in 2023? The answer is the same as we have discussed in our analysis of other new-age tech stocks as part of Inc42’s 2023 In Review series — improvement in fundamentals and an aggressive march towards profitability.\nNow, before we go into how 2024 looks for the stock, let’s take a look at the PB Fintech stock performance so far in 2023.\nMarch Towards Profitability Set The Stock On Fire Amid the increasing focus of startups, both listed and unlisted, on turning profitable, PB Fintech reported its first adjusted EBITDA profitable quarter in Q4 FY23. The startup also stated that it expected to turn profitable in FY24.\nThe development came just a quarter after PB Fintech’s lending vertical, Paisabazaar, achieved breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA level in Q3.\nLed by two back-to-back positive developments, PB Fintech shares gained over 38% year to date (YTD) by the end of May 2023.\nAmid all these, the startup saw a slew of new developments in 2023, including the rise in competition after Jio Financial Services entered into the insurtech space. However, the stock not only brushed aside the concerns and continued to climb up but was also less volatile in comparison to its fintech rival Paytm.\nRecommended For You: Features Losing Sheen?

Chetan T. 25th December, 2023 Features A Year To Remember: How Zomato Made A Roaring Comeback After 2022... Tapanjana R. 24th December, 2023 A look at some of the key developments at the startup during the year.\nThe Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) reportedly sent a show cause notice to Policybazaar earlier in the year for alleged wrongful claim of input tax credit. The DGGI notice was just the beginning of many other regulatory actions. Later in the year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) imposed a penalty of INR 1 Lakh on Paisabazaar Marketing and Consulting, a subsidiary of PB Fintech, for appointing a principal officer without requisite certification. In the most recent incident, Paisabazaar also came under the radar of the Income Tax Department . PB Fintech appointed Sarbvir Singh as the new joint group CEO of the company. Policybazaar secured a fresh fund infusion of INR 350 Cr ($42 Mn) from its parent entity PB Fintech. The startup’s ESOP expenses continue to be a drag on its bottom line. However, it has managed to bring down these expenses over the last few quarters. Most analysts strengthened their bullish outlook on the stock this year. In its last reported quarter – Q2 FY24 – PB Fintech reported a net loss of INR 21 Cr, which was a decline on a year-on-year basis but a rise on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis. However, the bull run in the stock remained unaffected by the QoQ rise as its two verticals, Policybazaar and PaisaBazaar, are showing strong growth.\nThe startup’s share price surged to INR 784 as of December 28 (Thursday) from INR 447.55 at the end of December 2022. The offloading of stakes by some of the major investors like SoftBank and Tiger Global during the year also failed to have any significant impact on the stock.\nDecoding PB Fintech’s Shareholding Pattern In line with the trend seen at Zomato and Paytm, PB Fintech also saw some of its pre-IPO investors selling their stakes in the startup.\nSoftBank, which has been selling its stakes in the listed Indian companies in its portfolio, offloaded a 2.53% stake in PB Fintech in December, held via its SVF Python II Cayman. Prior to that, the fund offloaded a 1.85% stake in the fintech major in October while SVF India Holdings (Cayman) also sold a 0.69% stake in the startup at the same time. Tencent Cloud Europe B.V. offloaded its 2.09% stake in PB Fintech in May this year, bringing down its holding to 6.28%. Meanwhile, the rise in the stock price attracted interest from mutual funds and other institutional investors. A large number of PB Fintech shares offloaded by pre-IPO investors were lapped up by the likes of HDFC Mutual Fund, Mirae Asset Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited, Societe Generale Odi, BNP Paribas Arbitrage, and Citigroup Global Markets Mauritius, among others.\nAs of the September 2023 quarter, as many as 21 mutual funds held a 7.83% stake in PB Fintech as against 16 of them holding a 4.68% stake a year ago. Insurance companies also increased their stakes to 3.7% from 0.84% at the end of the quarter ended September 2022.\nThe stakeholding of foreign portfolio investors in the company increased to 29.92% in the quarter ended September this year. Overall, foreign institutional investors held a 49.4% stake in PB Fintech at the end of Q2 FY24.\nWill The Stock Continue To Soar In 2024? The Street is largely bullish on the stock and expects it to continue the ongoing rally next year. Some brokerages believe that PB Fintech has the first-mover advantage in the insurtech space, which, along with its strong tech backbone, will help continue the strong growth despite the rising competition.\nIn a research note earlier this year, Kotak Institutional Equities said, “We believe that intense competition in the life business, with a change in tax rules and increase in maximum bancassurance partnership and increased negotiating power of PB, provide tailwinds to its growth.”\nMeanwhile, Citigroup opined that PB Fintech’s end-to-end customer journey model, market dominance in digital-backed origination, robust tech backbone, and transitioning monetisation model towards annuity revenue place it in a sweet spot.\nFollowing PB Fintech’s Q2 FY24 earnings, Keynote Capitals noted that the company was standing at a “pivotal juncture”, driven by catalysts such as renewal commission growth, strategic expansion into Tier II and III cities through offline channels, and stringent cost management. All these measures, the brokerage said, were poised to generate favourable operating leverage.\nHelped by its aggressive goals, the startup’s management now sees PB Fintech turning profitable by as early as Q3 FY24 .\nHowever, it is pertinent to note that brokerage JM Financial flagged competition from insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s (IRDAI’s) Bima Sugam and the rising losses of PB Fintech’s new initiatives business as key risks to its growth thesis.\nKush Ghodasara, CMT and an independent market expert, expects the stock to perform well in the long run but sees a decline in the next 2-3 months.\nAll said and done, the year 2024 promises to be another good year for PB Fintech’s investors. However, the stage for it would be set by the startup achieving its net profitability goal. As such, all eyes would be on PB Fintech’s financial performance in Q3 FY24 and the subsequent quarters.",

    "title": "La vacuna contra la bronquilitis en bebés evita 10.000 hospitalizaciones este invierno",
    "text": "La primera campaña de inmunización contra el Virus Sincitial Respiratorio (VRS), que se puso en marcha en octubre con el medicamento nirsevimab para proteger a los menores de un año de complicaciones como la bronquiolitis o la neumonía, ha evitado desde entonces casi 10.000 hospitalizaciones de bebés. Así lo pone de manifiesto la evaluación que ha realizado el Ministerio de Sanidad junto con las comunidades y el Centro Nacional de Epidemiología del Instituto de Salud Carlos III sobre la efectividad y el impacto de nirsevimab para prevenir la enfermedad grave -no la infección, puesto que no es esterilizante-. Con coberturas que han rebasado en algunas comunidades el 90 %, los resultados desvelan que la inmunización con el anticuerpo monoclonal nirsevimab, que España ha sido el primer país en aplicar de forma masiva, redujo el riesgo de hospitalización en un 83 % en los menores de 6 meses inmunizados. Los ingresos de los bebés de hasta 1 año de edad han caído un 75 % respecto a los que se estimaba que se iban a producir en este grupo, lo que se traduce en cerca de 10.000 hospitalizaciones evitadas. El VRS es la principal causa de infecciones en las vías respiratorias inferiores en la población infantil menor de un año, especialmente las relacionadas con bronquiolitis y neumonía; en España, las infecciones causadas por este virus provocan todos los inviernos una importante sobrecarga asistencial, tanto en atención primaria, como en urgencias y hospitales. Nirsevimab empezó a darse en octubre del año pasado a menores de 6 meses nacidos a partir del 1 abril de 2023 y hasta el 31 de marzo de este año, así como a bebés de riesgo de hasta 2 años; para la próxima temporada, ya está disponible la vacuna frente a VRS para embarazadas, que ofrecerá protección a los lactantes por el paso de anticuerpos durante el embarazo y que está pendiente de inclusión en el calendario vacunal. Después de un periodo de distorsión provocado por la covid-19, el sincitial, como otros virus, volvió a circular con fuerza en la temporada 2022-2023 hasta recuperar su comportamiento y valores habituales precovid en la sucesiva. De esta forma, su impacto en esta última temporada ha sido menor, según los datos del ISCIII: hasta marzo, el VRS dejó 465.723 infecciones atendidas en Atención Primaria (casi la mitad que las 877.252 de la temporada previa) y 21.190 hospitalizaciones frente a 34.632 ocurridas en 2022-2023. Las máximas tasas de ingresos se produjeron en menores de 1 año (3.329, el 15,7 % del total por VRS) en comparación con las 13.432 (38,8 %) de la temporada anterior.",

    "text": "Five ways Israelis have changed, after 5 months of war SHEFAYIM, Israel — Five months after the surprise Hamas assault on Israel on Oct. 7, and Israel's punishing military response in Gaza, Israeli and Palestinian lives have been immeasurably changed. The catastrophic conditions worsening daily in Gaza often overshadow the profound transformation Israelis have undergone. The state of Israel's society is crucial to understanding where the conflict might lead. Here are five ways Israel has been transformed in the last five months of war. 1. Israelis' lives are on hold Israelis remain in a state of suspended animation. Following the Oct. 7 attack, 94,000 Israelis are still displaced, evacuated from their homes near the restive Gaza and Lebanon borders. Some 32,000 of them are still being put up in hotels across Israel, according to data from an internal Israeli government database provided to NPR. It was only two weeks ago that Avidor Schwartzman, a survivor of the Oct. 7 attack, finally moved with his family from a room at the Shefayim Hotel, a resort north of Tel Aviv, to a new trailer park set up behind the hotel. \"It doesn't feel like home, but it feels a lot more like a home,\" he says. Schwartzman's trailer is one of eight prefab homes lined up in two rows, built on sand, housing broken families from the same devastated kibbutz, Kfar Aza. They include a young woman whose father was killed on Oct. 7; a family with a hostage still held in Gaza; and Schwartzman, whose in-laws were killed. \"I wish I could just, you know, erase it from my mind,\" he says about the attack. \"Not to wallow in everything, because there is so much sadness here, and so much grief.\" New homes are being built for the displaced residents of Kfar Aza, at another kibbutz near their old home. But Schwartzman says some families refuse to leave this trailer park of sadness until Israel strikes a deal with Hamas to free its remaining captives, around 130 Israelis, many believed to be alive. It is not just the evacuated, the survivors and the hostages whose lives are on hold. \"On Oct. 7, something cracked, or maybe broke, in the Israeli psyche,\" Schwartzman says. \"Even those that weren't there, just saw it on TV, they are still there.\" 2. Israelis believe the world has turned its back on them As global attention has turned to Israel's military campaign in Gaza, many Israelis are on a parallel warpath: to convince the world they are victims, not aggressors. Israel's foreign minister accuses the United Nations of minimizing the accounts of sexual violence deployed during the Oct. 7 attacks, and has recalled Israel's U.N. ambassador in protest. Young Israeli influencers are on the offensive on the social media battlefield. [Shiraz Shukrun](https://www.instagram.com/shiraz_shukrun/?hl=en), 25, an Instagram promoter of shampoo, Vaseline and beer to her 112,000 followers, volunteers with the Israeli Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, posting videos about Oct. 7. \"I find that I'm way angrier than before. I feel like so many people are against us,\" she says, referring to #FreePalestine hashtags and social media posts justifying the Hamas attack. \"Only Israelis know how other Israelis feel. No one will never know how we feel.\" 3. Israel's fractious society is largely united by the war The slogan Yachad Nenatzeach!, Together We Will Win!, is everywhere in Israel: draped on tech company buildings, featured on highway signs along with the traffic updates and displayed on buses along with the route number. \"There's a consensus in Israel that the war should continue until Hamas is not a military threat on Israel and does not control the Gaza Strip as such,\" says [Nadav Eyal](https://twitter.com/Nadav_Eyal), an Israeli author and journalist. Support for the war is widespread in Israel despite the cost for Palestinians. \"When people fight a war that begins with a murderous genocidal attack by one side on the other, the side that was attacked is less inclined to be empathetic towards its enemies,\" Eyal says. Palestinian children are suffering extreme hunger in Gaza, but a [poll conducted in mid-February](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/52976) finds 68% of Jewish Israelis oppose humanitarian aid. A catchphrase has caught on in Israel: haconceptzia — the concept — meaning the assumptions Israelis used to have about life alongside Palestinians. Many Israelis say they are now reevaluating their conceptzia. \"The beliefs we had before Oct. 7, we were just wrong. We were just naive,\" says Adi Peshko Katz, 34, a lawyer and mother of three. \"We thought that there is a hand from the other side that we can reach. We couldn't believe the plan B they had. Now we understand there was no plan A. This was the original plan to try and kill us all.\" 4. Israelis no longer depend on their army alone to protect them On Oct. 7, many civilians spent an entire day under Hamas attack before soldiers arrived to rescue them. This has led to a profound shift in Israel's concept of security: many believe they must now protect themselves. More than 9,200 new gun licenses were issued since Oct. 7, according to police. Around 900 armed security squads, the majority of them formed after Oct. 7, were mobilized to patrol cities and towns across Israel, made up of 12,500 volunteers trained by police, according to police. The army has overseen additional volunteer security squads. One of the youngest civilian volunteers on the security squad of the community of Rishpon, in central Israel, is Ori Kahan, 21. He keeps his newly issued assault rifle under his mattress, along with a stuffed dinosaur and model ship in his bedroom. \"After Oct. 7, I lost my attention, like, for, like, going to parties and bars and having fun,\" Kahan says. \"My whole life kind of shifted to being aware of the people around me.\" A friend of his mother was killed in January in a Palestinian car-ramming attack in the city of Raanana, one of several Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians since Oct. 7. Kahan recently took his assault rifle to go shopping at a thrift shop in a hipster Tel Aviv neighborhood, just in case. He found others shopping there carrying their rifles, too. 5. Israelis are girding for a possible war with a more formidable foe Even if the Gaza war winds down, Israelis are shifting their gaze toward their northern border, preparing themselves for a potential new war — with Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Iranian-backed group is better armed than Hamas, with long-range missiles that could paralyze the country. Israel and the U.S. hope diplomacy can avert such a war, but many Israelis are preparing just in case. Some are buying mobile protective structures, setting them up outside their homes and buildings. In Rishpon, the Kahan family has stocked up on dried food and bought a generator. Yaron Cohen, head of the industry department at the Israeli import company Tassa, says sales of generators have doubled since Oct. 7, to private customers, municipalities and Israel's main medic association, in case a Hezbollah attack knocks out Israel's electricity supply. He says the company is flooded with orders: it has three buyers for every generator it imports, and is now waiting for a new shipment to arrive. \"We're in trouble,\" Cohen says. \"We've run out of stock.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.
