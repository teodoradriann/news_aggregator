    "text": "EU to approve Ukraine reform plan in May, unlocking billions in aid – Bloomberg The European Union is moving toward approval of Ukraine's reform plan in May, which would unlock an additional €1.9 billion in EU financial assistance in late spring. Source: European Pravda, citing [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/eu-eyes-ukraine-reform-approval-in-may-in-bid-to-unlock-more-aid) The European Commission is examining the reform plan that Ukraine has committed to implement to receive financial aid, but the commission has no serious questions about it. EU member states may start approving the plan as early as next month, a person familiar with the matter told the agency. The EU has planned to allocate almost €16 billion to Ukraine this year, part of the EU's €50 billion Ukraine Facility for the 2024-2027 period. Last month, Kyiv submitted a plan containing investment and reform proposals that would gradually unlock most of the EU's aid by 2027. As part of the plan, the European Commission plans to disburse €1.5 billion in transitional funding in the second half of April. The rest of the funding planned for this year will be disbursed in two tranches once the Ukrainian government has implemented the agreed reforms. Among the agreed reforms for the second half of the year are the adoption of a medium-term state debt management strategy, a review of state budget expenditure, and an increase in staff at the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office. EU finance ministers [are expected to discuss Ukraine's plan on Friday in Luxembourg](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/04/10/7450599/). Ukraine has already received the first tranche of [€4.5 billion](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/20/7447338/) of the planned EU financial assistance for this year.

    "text": "News Article Author(s): Enhanced growing-up milk improved DHA, choline, and lutein levels and working memory in toddlers over 6 months, according to a study presented at NASPGHAN 2024. The consumption of enhanced growing-up milk (e-GUM) for 6 months had a beneficial effect on toddlers’ nutritional status of the nutrients DHA, choline, and lutein, a new study showed.1 The research was presented at the 2024 [Annual North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN)](https://www.hcplive.com/conference/naspghan) Meeting in Hollywood, Florida, from November 7 to November 9, 2024. Although nutrition is recognized as an integral part of early life development, not many studies have assessed nutrition’s impact on neurodevelopment in toddlers. Research has, however, demonstrated the synergistic functions of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), choline, and lutein in both fetal and early-life neurodevelopment.2,3 Despite this, many toddlers do not often consume foods rich in these nutrients.1 Investigators, led by Adrianna Greco, PhD candidate, from the Food, Nutrition, and Health department at The University of British Columbia in Vancouver, sought to investigate a dietary intervention’s impact on nutritional levels of DHA, choline, and lutein, as well as measures of emerging executive control in 408 healthy toddlers aged 17.5 to 18.5 months. In a 6-month study, the team examined the effect of growing-up milk (GUM) on levels of DHA, choline, lutein, and phospholipids, compared with the standard GUM (c-GUM), cow’s milk, and the non-intervention reference group. Toddlers were recruited from the Lower Mainland, British Columbia, and Canada. Caregivers could self-select their child to enroll in either GUM, cow milk, or the reference group. Participants in the GUM cohort were randomized to receive e-GUM or c-GUM daily for 6 months. At baseline and the 6-month follow-up, the team measured nutrient biomarkers in non-fasting blood samples. Executive control and impulse control were evaluated with the A-not-B task and Gift Delay task, respectively. The team assessed the impact of the dietary intervention on blood biomarkers of key nutrients and executive function outcomes through ANCOVA models. After adjusting for child sex and baseline nutrient status, investigators found toddlers in the e-GUM group had greater red blood cell DHA and plasma lutein/zeaxanthin than the toddlers in the c-GUM, cow milk, and reference groups (P < .05). Moreover, toddlers in the e-GUM group had greater plasma choline than those in the cow milk and reference group (P < .05) but not for the c-GUM group. However, the per-protocol analysis showed toddlers on e-GUM had greater plasma choline than toddlers on c-GUM, cow milk, or no intervention. Furthermore, after adjusting for child sex, breastfeeding duration, parental mood, and parental assessed intelligence, toddlers in the e-GUM group had a better performance on the A-not-B task than toddlers on cow milk (55.2% vs 43.3%; P < .05), but the performance was not significantly better than the other groups. As for the post-reversal trial on the A-not-B-task, the toddlers’ performance did not differ between groups. The team also observed no significant differences between groups for the gift delay task. “In this sample of toddlers with normative development, toddlers receiving e-GUM for 6 months showed higher measures of working memory, as reflected in higher A-not-B task overall performance,” investigators wrote. “The effect on emerging working memory but not on impulse control may reflect the developmental trajectories of executive control and warrants follow-up in later childhood.” References",

    "text": "By STAN MILAM Capitol News Service ,\n3 hours ago\nLAKE GENEVA — As a delegate to next week’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Bob Kordus of Lake Geneva wants to emphasize the need for the party to adhere to fiscal conservative principles.\n“I have spent my working career in banking and financial consulting,” Kordus said. “That experience tells me that there needs to be a conservative approach to government spending that will lead to a strong economy.”\nIn addition to his financial experience, Kordus has given decades of service to the Republican Party.\n“I have been involved in the party organization for 20-plus years including membership on the Walworth County party and First District boards,” he said. “I am the past treasurer of the First District GOP Party.”\nAs a delegate to the national convention, Kordus will vote on the party platform which was recently released.\n“I have read summaries and have briefly gone over the platform, and in general I agree with what I have seen,” he said. “I believe the platform aligns with my conservative views.”\nKordus said he will know more about the details of the platform after a meeting with party leaders.\n“I plan to meet with state party chair Brian Schimming prior to the convention,” he said. “I will have the opportunity to get more details on the platform and ask questions about some of my areas of concern.”\nKordus was a supporter of the Tea Party movement and has been a consistent supporter of Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson.\n“Sen. Johnson has been and remains a strong critic of deficit spending,” Kordus said. “I could not agree with him more.”\n“We have seen continuing deficit spending under the Biden administration and what it has led to in terms of the economy,” he said. “Biden has overturned several of President Trump’s executive orders that were working.”\nKordus said examples of those Trump executive orders include current issues of great concern.\n“Look at the current border problems,” he said. “Our borders are not secure. President Trump was working to secure our borders, but that was all undone by Biden.”\nKordus is also concerned about the nation’s trade policies. He questioned whether a free market can be achieved while so-called trading partners consistently violate trade agreements.”\nDemonstrations, including a parade, are planed during the convention. Kordus said he has no problem with those activities.\n“Everyone has a right to express their opinions the same as I do,” he said. “As long as the demonstrations and similar activities involve no violence, I see no problem with them. I hope that we all can be respectful of the views of others.”\nIn addition to party politics at its highest level, Kordus sees the convention as an opportunity to share with the rest of the nation Wisconsin and its largest city.\n“As a former resident of Milwaukee, I’m looking forward to being a part of an event that will showcase a great city and a great state,” he said. “Like many others, I’m proud to represent Wisconsin in this important event.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
