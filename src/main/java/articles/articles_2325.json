    "text": "The Access Fund has released a statement about a climbing success story in New Hampshire where climbers have purchased a property that will secure access to a crag. Below is the statement, follow them on Instagram for more access news.\nAccess Fund and Central New Hampshire Climbers’ Association (CNHCA) have announced the purchase of a key parcel of land in Thornton, New Hampshire, to provide access to the popular Merriam Woods crag.\nMerriam Woods (sometimes known as Russell Crags) is one of the most recently developed crags in New Hampshire. Climbing even compared it to the iconic Rumney in terms of its potential for high-quality climbing and its natural setting.\nThe acquisition encompasses five acres of land that abuts the White Mountain National Forest and Merriam Woods—conservation land owned and managed by the town of Woodstock, New Hampshire. Use of the area is only expected to increase, and with that increase comes the need to develop sustainable climbing infrastructure.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Friends of Merriam Woods (@friends_of_merriam_woods)\n“We are excited to acquire this land and work to build a new parking lot,” says CNHCA President Jay Knower. “With the increasing popularity of Merriam Woods and the surrounding Russell Crags, this project will help alleviate potential issues caused by visitor use and foster good will among the community at large.”\nAccess to the crags around Woodstock has been a historical challenge. In the spring of 2023, discussions were underway between local climbers and the Woodstock Conservation Commission regarding the imperiled climbing access to Merriam Woods. One of the key concerns raised by local residents was the need for sufficient parking along the road to the crag.\nAround the same time, Knower connected with the sellers. “We noticed that this piece of land was the only privately held parcel near Merriam Woods,” says Knower. “So we approached the owners about purchasing it, figuring that it wouldn’t hurt to ask.” The owners agreed to sell their property to CNHCA and were very supportive of the organization’s plans to build a small parking lot for climbers and other recreationists at a new trailhead. The lot will address landowner concerns and provide an avenue for sharing up-to-date information about proper use of these areas.\n“Climbers from CNHCA and Access Fund spent a significant amount of time working with the town of Woodstock to keep climbing open and conserved at Merriam Woods,” says Brian Tickle, Access Fund’s national acquisitions director. “This acquisition is a reminder that sustainable climbing often requires infrastructure beyond just trails, staging areas, and fixed anchors, and it also serves as an example of climbers addressing the needs of neighboring landowners.”\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Access Fund (@accessfund)",

    "text": "- The CS said Kenya has been working with partners to create an enabling environment in the Indian Ocean and inland waters. - Mvurya said Kenya and the EU have already agreed on several areas that will be critical to profile investments. Cabinet Secretary for Mining, Blue Economy, and Maritime Affairs, Salim Mvurya has assured international investors of Kenya's readiness to capitalise on opportunities in the blue economy sector. Mvurya said Kenya has implemented favourable legislation and developed essential infrastructure to facilitate and regulate investments in the blue economy. \"We have been able to synchronise our laws and regulations to create an enabling environment for both local and international investors,” he said. The CS said Kenya has been working with partners to create an enabling environment in the Indian Ocean and inland waters to profile critical investment areas on blue economy and fisheries. The government has very progressive and reliable research institutes such as Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute that provide crucial data and technology to propel the blue economy, he added. Mvurya spoke during the official launch of the second Blue Invest Africa 2024 Conference at the Diani Reef Hotel in Kwale county. The event brought together investors and entrepreneurs from Africa and other European continents. The CS said the conference comes at an appropriate time, given the government's commitment to nurture numerous opportunities in the blue economy sector. He added that the conference comes at a critical time for the government, as it prepares to implement the economic partnership agreement with the European Union. Mvurya said Kenya and the EU have already agreed on several areas that will be critical to profile investments. The CS said the EU has been excellent partners in Kenya, whose assistance has helped give the blue economy a new face not only in the country but also in Africa. EU's partnership has helped Kenya attract investments and grow the blue economy sector, he said. \"We have walked this journey together because the blue economy is not a new concept but it was not well attended and the partnership with the EU has spiced up our commitment to invest in the sector,\" he said. Mvurya said the partnership will increase capacity building for young women and men so that they have the necessary skills to fully exploit the sector. \"We have identified Bandari Maritime Academy and its associate institutions, the Technical University of Mombasa which is supposed to be initiating courses in Marine to train more experts in the blue economy through EU support,\" he said. The CS announced that they have reached an agreement with the EU to strengthen their partnership in the Indian Ocean's Marine Spatial Plan and the Lake Region Spatial Plan in Lake Victoria to ensure proper investment in the blue economy. Mvurya said the government is also considering transitioning from onshore fishing to mariculture in the Indian Ocean and aquaculture in inland waters, adding that both concepts have received a commitment from the EU and other partners. He said President William Ruto has been at the forefront of promoting the blue economy and that Maritime and Shipping are key agenda items for Kenya. EU ambassador Henriette Geiger said the conference provides an opportunity for stakeholders to learn about innovation and technology to spearhead the processing of marine resources to foster blue economy investment. She said sharing experiences on the sector will have an impact on decision makers and other entrepreneurs to ensure the sector's sustainability. Geiger said as stakeholders engage on issues of aquaculture, coastal tourism, fisheries and plastic transformation, they must take into consideration biodiversity loss and climate change. \"By doing business, we also have to do what is good for our world,\" she said. EU Director General Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Charlina Vitcheva said blue economy has a great potential for growth and investment. She said the sector is a driver for socioeconomic development and livelihoods. Vitcheva added that the ocean is a treasure and offers various job opportunities such as cruise tourism and fishing. She said the ocean also offers a wide investment in the field of renewable energy, food products and medicine. Kwale Governor Fatuma Achani said the county presents several opportunities within the blue economy due to its proximity to the Indian Ocean and rich marine resources. She said some of the potential opportunities include; marine fisheries, aquaculture, coastal tourism, marine renewable energy, marine biotechnology and waste management. Achani said the Shimoni Port stands ready to benefit immensely from a public-private partnership, driving growth in the blue economy through sustainable marine resource management. She said the county is actively seeking investment to add value to seaweed farming, a promising sector ripe for innovation and expansion. Achani said efforts to initiate direct flights from Nairobi to Diani are set to boost tourism, showcasing the stunning coastal beaches, vibrant hospitality sector and rich wildlife reserve She said the completion of the Dongo Kundu Bypass enhances access to Kwale county, creating new business opportunities and fostering economic growth. Achani urged the investors and entrepreneurs to take advantage of the conference to forge partnerships, invest in innovation, and pave the way for a prosperous and sustainable future.",

    "text": "Ramadan, the holiest month in Islam, is not just a time for fasting but also for spiritual reflection and community bonding. As Muslims fast from dawn till dusk, it's crucial to stay hydrated and energised during the non-fasting hours. With Ramadan 2024 upon us, it's the perfect time to explore some refreshing and nutritious drink options to break your fast. Whether you prefer traditional favourites like Jallab and Sahlab or refreshing options like lemon mint cooler and watermelon rose cooler, these drinks are sure to quench your thirst and uplift your spirits during this blessed month of fasting and prayer. Here are five special drink recipes that will help you stay hydrated and rejuvenated throughout the month.\nTamarind Juice\nTamarind juice is a tangy and refreshing drink that is popular across many Muslim-majority countries during Ramadan. To prepare this drink, soak tamarind pods in warm water for a few hours, then strain the mixture to extract the juice. Add sugar or honey to sweeten according to your preference, and chill before serving. Tamarind juice is known for its cooling properties and is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals.\nJallab\nThis traditional Middle Eastern drink is a delightful blend of dates, grape molasses, rose water, and pine nuts. To make Jallab, soak some dates in water overnight, then blend them with grape molasses and rose water. Add a sprinkle of pine nuts and serve it chilled over ice. Jallab is not only refreshing but also rich in essential nutrients, making it an ideal choice to replenish your energy levels after a day of fasting.\nLemon Mint Cooler\nBeat the heat with this zesty and invigorating lemon mint cooler. Simply blend fresh lemon juice, mint leaves, sugar, and water together until smooth. Strain the mixture to remove any pulp, then refrigerate until cold. Serve the lemon mint cooler over ice with a garnish of fresh mint leaves for a refreshing burst of flavour. This drink is not only hydrating but also aids digestion, making it perfect for breaking your fast.\nWatermelon Rose Cooler\nIndulge in the natural sweetness of watermelon with this refreshing rose-infused cooler. Simply blend fresh watermelon chunks with a splash of rose water until smooth. Strain the mixture to remove any pulp, then refrigerate until chilled. Serve the watermelon rose cooler over ice with a hint of mint for a cooling and hydrating treat. Watermelon is high in water content, making this drink perfect for staying hydrated during Ramadan.\nSahlab\nOriginating from the Levant region, Sahlab is a creamy and comforting drink made from orchid root powder, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of cinnamon. To prepare Sahlab, mix orchid root powder with milk and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until thickened. Pour the mixture into cups, sprinkle with cinnamon, and serve warm. Sahlab is not only delicious but also soothing, making it an ideal choice for calming the stomach after a day of fasting.\nALSO READ:\nTry your hands on these 5 rose-infused recipes to elevate your Ramadan 2024",

However, she issued a stern warning against politicians and police officers who she claimed encourage hawkers to encroach, take bribes from them, and then use bulldozers to evict them, reported.Addressing a meeting with ministers, bureaucrats, police, and hawkers' union representatives at Nabanna, the state secretariat, Banerjee said she disapproves of the use of bulldozers and wants the one-month pause to be used for conducting surveys in hawking zones to identify alternatives and solutions. She warned that encroachments removed during the past week should not be allowed to return and called on police and politicians to curb their greed.\\\"I do not believe in first allowing encroachers and then using bulldozers. I want restrictions to be imposed from the beginning,\\\" Banerjee said, warning: \\\"Politicians who incite hawkers will be arrested, regardless of their party affiliation, and police officers supporting them will either be arrested by their superiors or removed from their positions.\\\" \\\"The local mafia, the sand mafia, the land mafia are doing everything. Why should I take the blame? They are taking money with their right hand and giving it to BJP with their left hand,\\\" she alleged.",

    "text": "Sign Out Jun 27, 2024 | 18:40 GMT (TONY KARUMBA/AFP via Getty Images) The Kenyan government's apparent intent to press ahead with budget cuts to make up for the lost revenue from the scrapped finance bill will risk reigniting large-scale protests that could force Ruto to scale back fiscal consolidation efforts, which would fuel renewed concerns about the country's debt sustainability. On June 26, Kenyan President William Ruto announced that he would not sign the controversial Finance Bill 2024, which aimed to raise $2.3 billion in new tax revenue. This came after protesters opposing the bill stormed the Kenyan Parliament on June 25 following the bill's approval in a third reading by 195-106 votes, prompting a heavy crackdown by law enforcement in which at least 23 people were killed. In a bid to appease protesters, Ruto said his government would launch a dialogue with Kenya's youth -- who led the protest movement -- as well as with professional and religious bodies, on how...
