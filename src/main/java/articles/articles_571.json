    "text": "It is said that a small pea sized gland in the brain is supposedly responsible for one's ability to connect with the universe but it can be greatly affected with toxins and Pineal XT was developed to be a solution to this problem. According to a recent study from Harvard University, it was linked that fluoride present in the drinking water can lower IQs in children, and 19 other studies supported this fact too. Fluoride, and other toxic chemicals in drinking water, food and even the air, are linked to all sorts of other problems with people's bodies and can cause damage to internal organs. These toxins are highly attracted to the pineal gland, otherwise known as the third eye, and many people believe that if this organ is damaged, one's ability to manifest will not be possible. With its unique blend of hard to source ingredients, Pineal XT is designed to help support healthy body function, promote proper pineal gland function and support one's energy levels. Its closely guarded formula can supercharge the pineal gland, helping people to connect with the universe and experience all of the blessings it has to offer. Unlimited love, prosperity, happiness, and abundance awaits. Visit https://pinealxt.com/ for more information.

    "text": "2024-08-22 20:17:42\nThe feud between long-time Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and head coach Domenico Tedesco has reached a fever pitch. At the age of 32, she announced her retirement from the national team – because of Tedesco. The Real Madrid goalkeeper announced on social networks: “Unfortunately, following the incident with the coach and after careful consideration, I have decided not to return to the Belgian national team under his leadership.”\nThe situation was sparked in June when Tedesco handed injured Kevin De Bruyne forward Romelu Lukaku the captaincy in an international tie against Austria (1-1). with Courtois, who previously received the honor for his 100th international match. Although there was still a game against Estonia, the goalkeeper left after the game. After a recrimination ensued, with Courtois essentially accusing his coach of lying, the argument gradually worsened. Courtois was not selected for Belgium’s European Cup squad due to a torn cruciate ligament.\n1724358971\n#Courtois #longer #plays #Belgium #Tedesco",

    "text": "( MENAFN ) Christmas joy is noticeably absent from the streets of Syrian cities, as the major churches have curtailed festive celebrations, opting instead for prayers in solidarity with the Palestinians enduring the hardships of war in Gaza.\n“In Palestine, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, people are suffering,” the Syriac Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, Mor Dionysius Antoine Shahda, informed a French news outlet.\nIn the typical festive scene of the central district of Azizia in northern Syria, one would expect a lively Christmas market, a grand Christmas tree, and streets adorned with lights and trinkets.\nHowever, this year presents a stark contrast, as the main square is nearly deserted, devoid of any Christmas decorations or the usual holiday hustle and bustle.\n“In Syria we canceled all official celebrations and receptions in our churches in solidarity with the victims of the bombing on Gaza” by Israeli military, Shahda declared.\nThe Syriac Catholic Church was joined by leaders from three prominent churches in Syria—the Greek Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, and Melkite Greek Catholic patriarchs—in the decision to cancel Christmas festivities. Instead, they have opted to restrict celebrations to religious ceremonies.\n“Given the current circumstances, especially in Gaza, the patriarchs apologize for not receiving Christmas and New Year greetings,” the trio said in a joint statement, adding they were limiting ceremonies to “prayers.”\nThe health ministry in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory reports that over 20,000 people have lost their lives in the Gaza Strip since Israel initiated a substantial air and ground offensive in response to a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7.\nMENAFN24122023000045015839ID1107653170\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "Every day this December, Playbill will be getting into the spirit of the season with 31 Days of Holiday Cheer—sharing some of our favorite music videos from Broadway stars. Check in daily for classic tunes and new songs about Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Year's. And we even have some surprise new, original Playbill videos to share.\nThe a cappella group Pentatonix recorded Fleet Foxes' \"White Winter Hymnal\" for their 2014 album That's Christmas to Me. A recent performance on Good Morning America has the song on loop in our heads again. The lyrics are a little abstract, and possibly even morbid. But hey, it's about winter and they mention snow and the group put it on a Christmas album, so we're including it in our holiday video series. Plus it just sounds so cool! Accompanied by only their slaps, snaps, and claps, check out Pentatonix singing \"White Winter Hymnal\" in the video above.\nMembers of Pentatonix are Scott Hoying, Mitch Grassi,\nKirstin Maldonado, Matt Sallee, and Kevin Olusola. Formed in 2011, the group has released 12 studio albums (including several Christmas albums). They have three Grammy Awards; two for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella and one for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for their collaboration with Dolly Parton on her song \"Jolene.\"\nMaldonado made her Broadway debut in 2018 in\nKinky Boots as Lauren, following several Broadway favorites in the role, including Annaleigh Ashford, Jeanna de Waal, and Taylor Louderman.\nPentatonix can currently be seen in the 2023 Christmas film Candy Cane Lane on Amazon Prime (they play carolers turned into tiny figurines by an evil elf). Eddie Murphy and Tracee Ellis Ross star, along with an appearance from Tony winner\nDavid Alan Grier as Santa. VIDEO: 31 Days of Holiday Cheer: The Original Hadestown Fates Sing 'Sleigh Ride'",
