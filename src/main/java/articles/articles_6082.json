'One of the Hamasniks said he loves me, and that he brought my mother to approve of us getting married,' she recounted Noga Weiss, an 18-year-old Israeli who was kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7, and held in captivity for 50 days, said that one of her Palestinian captors wanted to marry her. \"He gave me a ring on day 14, and I stayed with him until day 50,\" she said during an interview on Channel 12 News. \"He told me: Everyone will be released, but you will stay.

A few days later, she was reunited with her mother because her captor wanted to ask for her hand in marriage. \"One of the Hamas members said he loves me, he wants to marry me and brought my mother to me so she would approve of our marriage,\" she admitted. \"A woman dressed as an Arab entered, and I realize it's my mother. I thought they killed her, I thought I was alone. Suddenly she's alive, and I'm no longer alone.\" Weiss and her mother were released in a deal on November 25. In her interview with Channel 12, she recounted the day of her [kidnapping at Kibbutz Be'eri](/israel-news/2023-10-19/ty-article/.premium/on-kibbutz-beeri-time-stood-still-evidence-of-life-before-the-massacre/ 18b-4465-d242-abef-566704e70000): \"They started shooting at the door, something like 40 shots until they managed to get in. We saw the conversations on WhatsApp and understood what was happening. People wrote that their house is on fire and stopped answering.\" \"Mom told me to get under the bed, she thought, 'Let them come and shoot her straight away.' I went under the bed, they came and kidnapped her. After they took her out, I heard gunshots, I thought she was murdered and not kidnapped,\" Weiss said. She had attempted to run and hide from the terrorists, but one of them noticed her and took her outside to the yard and sat her there, she said. \"Something like 40 terrorists were around me with Kalashnikov [rifles], they handcuffed me; I saw bodies of people I know from the kibbutz. After a few minutes, they put me in a car and start driving.\" According to her, thousands of people, including children, cheered when the vehicle entered Gaza, and attempted to beat her. \"I didn't understand why they were delaying shooting me.\" Weiss was held captive with Moran Stella Yanai, and said that on her second night in Gaza, she was woken up by a bomb, when the window she was sleeping near shattered and injured her. They were moved at nighttime wearing a hijab, and \"Hamasniks held our hands so that people would think we were married, so that there would be nothing suspicious,\" Weiss said. \"They brought cards to play with, and I said fine, I'll play with them, I'll do what they want, as long as they don't shoot.\" \"Their moods changed so quickly. One minute they played with us and laughed, a second later they came with a gun. You always have to please them,\" Weiss added. She said that her captors tried to convince them that \"Israel is theirs, that they occupied the house. One said he was an elementary school teacher, and only talked about the fact that we kicked them out of their house and how wrong it was.\" Weiss says that she \"can't digest it, neither then nor now. People don't understand the feeling of fear. I was 50 days, 24/7, with the thought that they would get tired and come shoot me, or they wouldn't need me in the end. Let's say at night they lock us in the room, so they open the door in the middle of the night and shoot us without us knowing.\" She said that as long as there are hostages in the strip, she can't mourn her father. \"They are there for an indescribable amount of time. At one point, they brought us half a liter of water for two days. It does not make sense. You can't survive like this for 200 days.\"",

    "title": "Tech sector faces turbulence: Elusive gains amid broad declines",
    "text": "Sector Overview\nToday's stock market snapshot reveals a challenging day for several key sectors, particularly technology and consumer cyclical. The technology sector is under pressure, showing declines across major players such as Microsoft (MSFT) down 1.27%, Adobe (ADBE) slipping by 1.63%, and Salesforce (CRM) dropping 1.20%. The volatility in semiconductors is notable, with heavyweights like Nvidia (NVDA) down 1.34% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) sliding 1.77%.\nIn the consumer cyclical space, Amazon (AMZN) experienced a drop of 2.14%, indicating cautious investor sentiment. Meanwhile, the financial sector shows mixed results, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gaining 0.47% while American Express (AXP) dips slightly by 0.33%.\nMarket Mood and Trends\nThe prevailing sentiment in the market is one of caution and uncertainty. Declines in major tech and consumer cyclical stocks suggest investors are wary of potential headwinds. This cautious approach could be in response to economic data or geopolitical events influencing the broader market outlook. Interestingly, communication services with companies like Google (GOOG) down 1.26% are also feeling the pinch, likely reflecting concerns over ad revenues and regulatory pressures.\nStrategic Recommendations\nGiven the current market dynamics, investors should consider adopting a more defensive strategy. It's advisable to monitor developments within the tech sector closely, especially as upcoming earnings reports or policy changes could further impact investor sentiment. Diversifying investments across more stable sectors such as financials or healthcare, where volatility is less pronounced, might offer some shelter.\nAdditionally, keeping an eye on consumer defensive stocks like Procter and Gamble (PG), which managed a small gain of 0.50%, could prove beneficial. These stocks often provide a buffer during market downturns.\nFor the latest insights and detailed market analysis, visit [ForexLive.com](/) to stay updated on the dynamic shifts and trends affecting global markets.",

    "text": "GV Prakash will be seen as a lead alongside Abbas in the directorial debut of Maria Raja Elenchezhian, an erstwhile assistant of Pradeep Ranganathan. The yet-to-be-titled film also stars Sri Gouri Priya of Lover fame. The film marks the debut production venture of Beyond Pictures.\nWhile the makers are still keeping the film's premise under wraps, director Maria says the film is a family comedy entertainer. \"In terms of the film's genre, it will be similar to the genres of Love Today and Dragon,\" he explains.\nThe upcoming film marks the comeback of Abbas, who was last seen in Pachakkallam in 2015. On choosing Abbas for the film, director Maria reveals, \"We were looking for the right fit for the character, and Abbas sir seemed apt for it. I hope this role ends up as a good comeback for him. He looks extremely different and fresh in this role.\"\nWhile the title will be announced by the makers on a later date, director Maria says, \"The title is the name of GV Prakash's character in the film.\" When asked about choosing GV Prakash to play the protagonist, he shares, \"It has been a while since he played such a character in a comedy zone. I want the same energy that GV Prakash brought to Trisha Illana Nayanthara to this film.\"\nGV Prakash and Gouri Priya will be seen as a pair in the film. \"Gouri will be seen in a completely different character, completely contrasting to the character she portrayed in Lover. She will be seen in a bubbly persona, and this character will give a lot of scope for performance,\" says Maria.\nOn what to expect from this untitled film, Maria says that the meter would be similar to that of Pradeep Ranganathan's. \"I was a part of Love Today's core writing team and have worked with Pradeep in other films as well. So I carry a bit of his comedic meter and timing. You can expect that type of comedy in this upcoming film.\"\nProduced by Jayavardhanan and co-produced by Jaikanth Suresh, the film is currently in the second schedule of shooting. The filmmaker shares that the film's shoot is scheduled to wrap up in August. Geetha Kailasam and George Maryan are also a part of the film's cast.\nThe upcoming film will have music by Justin Prabhakaran, cinematography by Madhan Christopher, editing by Selva RK, art direction by Kumar Gangappan, and costume design by Praveen Raja.",

    "text": "- Halynne Shi is a product manager at Spotify.\n- But her first job after graduation was in aviation, working for Changi Airport Group.\n- Shi said the transition from aviation into tech was like a rollercoaster ride.\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with\nHalynne Shi, a product manager at Spotify who used to work for Changi Airport Group. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment history.\nI was quite a dreamer when I began mulling career options after graduating high school.\nBack then, I figured that being a diplomat would be cool. I had these grand ideas of what a career in diplomacy could entail, whether it be jetting about the world or brokering peace treaties over coffee.\nThe reality turned out very differently, of course. I didn't pursue a career in diplomacy even though I majored in international relations at college.\nI was still interested in global affairs, so I decided to pursue a career in international business instead.\nThat led me to start my career at\nChangi Airport Group, the manager of the world's best airport.\nCutting my teeth across rotations\nI went through three rotations during my time with Changi Airport Group.\nIn 2017, I embarked on my first posting, which was in business development. The airline development team I was assigned to was responsible for brokering airline partnerships.\nGoing through that posting was like taking a crash course on the airline industry. I learned about the industry's complexity and how airlines orchestrated their routes to and through Singapore.\nI moved on to my second posting about a year later. This time, I was with the passenger development team, working on projects to boost passenger traffic from China and Southeast Asian nations.\nBut it was really in my final posting in product operations that I found my calling. In 2020, I joined the e-commerce arm of Changi Airport, better known as\niShopChangi.\nWorking on the airport's e-commerce platform allowed me to roll up my sleeves and dive into the nitty gritty of product development. It was like piecing a puzzle together and identifying innovative solutions to enhance the airport's efficiency.\nMy time at Changi Airport was a whirlwind of learning and growth. Working in the travel and aviation sector was like being handed a backstage pass to the global stage.\nItching for a new challenge\nAfter spending more than years with the airport, I began itching for a new challenge.\nAt that point, my working experience was a mosaic of experiences in business development, marketing, and operations.\nWhile each posting gave me a specific lens into how a business works, I craved a deeper understanding of how these pieces could come together.\nThat's what drew me to the tech industry. I figured that the industry's dynamic nature meant it would be a perfect playground for someone hungry to see the direct impact of their work.\nI left Changi Airport Group to join Shopback, a shopping and rewards platform, as a product manager.\nThe learning curve was like a rollercoaster\nI had no formal technical training when I started as a product manager. I didn't have any product training. The learning curve felt like riding a roller coaster.\nEventually, I realized I could leverage my experiences in my new role. The skills I picked up in business development, marketing, and streamlining operations were transferable.\nThat said, I won't sugarcoat my transition into the tech industry. The transition was certainly not a walk in the park. It was a journey of self-discovery and learning to leverage your skills.\nToday, I've learned how to thrive in the tech landscape by distinguishing myself with my unique set of experiences.\nThe two sectors are worlds apart\nI had a huge change in perspective when I switched industries.\nEven though Changi Airport is corporatized, it operates in a highly regulated aviation space. For instance, the airport must abide by multiple international regulations, such as airspace treaties. We also needed to negotiate and liaise with various parties and governmental agencies.\nIn comparison, an e-commerce company like Shopback faces relatively fewer regulations and can thus move much faster.\nThe speed at which we delivered our products was quicker, which I welcomed. I had more autonomy at Shopback to build products and make decisions.\nShopback's teams were much leaner, too, which meant that I was closer to the key decision-makers in the company.\nNo regrets\nEven though I enjoy what I do now, I have no regrets about starting my career at Changi Airport.\nThe structured learning you get from working at a large-scale organization is helpful. That would've been harder to grasp if I had started my career in tech instead, which is a lot more fluid and volatile.\nI didn't know it then, but those years I spent at Changi Airport helped lay the building blocks that made me the product manager I am today.\nBusiness Insider",

    "text": "Local prairies are threatened by encroaching trees\nTOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Prairies are threatened by a mix of invasive and native plant species. As these species expand their territory, they prevent the growth of local grasses. This is especially true of woody plants, like the Eastern Red Cedar, which can block a necessary resource all plants need.\n“Plants in prairies that are essentially made to live in the light because most of the time you don’t have a lot of shade in a prairie. They’re going to really be tamped down by having something that’s always blocking that light over the top of them,” said Jason Emry, an Associate Professor in the Biology Department of Washburn University.\nOur region has received enough rain that trees are over-shadowing important grasses.\n“Grasses do well where we have relatively dry years, and they can outcompete a lot of these trees, when that moisture just gets in that upper level of the soil because we don’t have very much. But if you start to get these large saturating events of rain, it goes into these deeper layers and that’s where trees can actually root deeper than some of the grasses can.”\nEven local trees that are endemic to the area are expanding their outreach.\n“As prairies might get a little bit wetter, you might see more trees start to encroach. And we do have native trees that are here, so things like dogwoods are a native tree, we have cottonwoods that are native trees, but they’re typically found in areas that are a little bit wetter.”\nLeft unchecked, the trees threaten cattle pastures as well.\n“Deer might browse woody vegetation, but cows don’t really browse that woody vegetation as much. So once they’re starting to move in the prairies, you’re starting to kind of alter that habitat a little bit because you have a plant that wasn’t really there in the first place.”\nThe more trees take root, the harder they are to eliminate.\n“Once they get established, even if you burn it, it might not kill the tree at that point because you obviously have a really well-established tree. It’s not this little baby seedling that’s trying to get going and competing with the grasses.”\nThe Kansas Great Plains Grasslands Initiative is working to preserve grasslands and prairies in Kansas.

    "text": "Alimentación Andalucía recupera la producción normal de aceite de oliva El aforo prevé superar el millón de toneladas, casi un 20% más de aceite de oliva que en la media del último lustro, pero la aceituna de mesa aún no se recupera (-3,2%) Las estimaciones de producción de aceite de oliva en Andalucía para la campaña 2024/2025 indican que pueda superar el millón de toneladas, lo que supone un 76,6 % más que la producción final de la pasada campaña y casi un 19,7% más de la media de los cinco últimos años. Estos datos se desprenden del aforo del olivar presentado en Jaén. De confirmarse esta previsión, la producción andaluza recuperaría la normalidad. Incluso, si llueve este otoño las cifras podrían aumentar. La referencia de la campaña pasada no es significativa porque fue excepcionalmente mala, como ya lo fue la anterior. De ahí que el precio del aceite se haya disparado en los mercados. La presente campaña se ha visto favorecida por las precipitaciones y las temperaturas suaves en primavera, lo que ha contribuido a mejorar parcialmente el estado de las plantaciones. Por provincias, Jaén se encuentra a la cabeza con la producción de 445.000 toneladas, un 22,6% más que la media de los últimos cinco años; seguida de Córdoba con 271.000 toneladas, casi un 28,1% más; y Sevilla en tercer lugar con 125.000 toneladas, un 19,1% más. El porcentaje de aceite de oliva producido ha aumentado, respecto al último lustro en todas las provincias, excepto en Almería, Málaga y Huelva. En Almería se prevén 7.400 toneladas de aceite de oliva, un 43,5% menos; en Cádiz 22.500 toneladas, con un 133,7 % de subida; en Granada se estima una producción de 103.300 toneladas, un 7,8% más; en Huelva se espera producir 9.000 toneladas, menos 1,2%; y en Málaga, serán 37.800 las toneladas de aceite producidas, casi el 17,3% menos que en la media del último lustro. [Aforo del olivar](https://www.larazon.es/documents/2024/10/03/A34991EB-40B4-4A8C-AA1F-EBE43F6E6A94/estimacionaceitemesa202425jaen.pdf) En cuanto a la aceituna de almazara, se estima una producción de 5.347.700 toneladas en toda Andalucía, de las que 2.100.000 toneladas se producirán en la provincia de Jaén; 1.547.500 en Córdoba; 750.000 toneladas en Sevilla; 516.500 en Granada; 210.000 en Málaga; 132.900 en Cádiz; 48.200 en Huelva y 42.600 toneladas en Almería. En empleo, se espera una campaña que registrará unos 17,3 millones de jornales en labores asociadas al cultivo, de los que un 64,6% corresponderán a la recolección. En Jaén se prevén más de 3,8 millones de jornales en recolección. El consumo de aceite de oliva en 2023 sufrió un severo descenso respecto a valores de años anteriores, aunque en el caso del aceite virgen extra aún se mantiene por encima de valores de hace diez años. En cuanto a las exportaciones, en la última campaña volvieron a descender respecto a la campaña anterior, aunque aumentaron en valor más de un 19%. En cuanto al aforo de producción de aceituna de mesa, la previsión es que para la campaña 2024/2025 se obtengan 388.487 toneladas de aceituna de mesa, un 18,1% superior a la obtenida en la campaña pasada. No obstante, con respecto a la media de los cinco últimos años sigue siendo inferior en 3,2 puntos. Sevilla es la principal provincia productora de aceituna de almazara alcanzando las 280.000 toneladas; seguida de Córdoba con 62.693 toneladas. En empleo, se espera que la campaña registre unos 3,42 millones de jornales (2,47 millones en Sevilla).",
