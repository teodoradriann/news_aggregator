    "text": "I’ve always put my family and friends and my job first, but I didn’t make myself a priority. I’m 52 and my husband, Geoffrey, and I have two amazing sons — one is a teacher and the other is a nurse — and we have five grandchildren. I’ve taken on a lot of responsibility with my mother-in-law, who has dementia and had to be placed in a care facility. It was heartbreaking and exhausting dealing with it all. And my parents have health issues too. I’m the go-to person for everyone, and I wasn’t eating well. I was battling stomach problems. Tracy Wysocki, a co-worker who had won the Thrive Challenge, inspired me to start. Geoffrey and I began planning meals instead of just grabbing something to eat. We’re taking Microsteps like replacing sugary drinks with water and adding more fruits and veggies to our diet. I pack healthy lunches to take into work now, like tuna and hard hard boiled eggs, and for snacks I’ll have nuts and berries. I’ve stopped eating cookies and cakes all day. Now that I’m making better food choices, I find I’m not fatigued. For dinner, we’re eating fish a few times a week, instead of red meat. And we’re trying new leafy greens — we’re putting kale in salads. I’m making a kale soup that even my husband enjoys. And eating this way has helped with my digestive issues. To get moving, I started taking easy Microsteps. I do squats while brushing my teeth, and then I do arm circles. Adding regular exercising to my daily routine has been challenging for me, but I’m up for it. At work, I’m walking around all day and I get in a lot of steps. I’m on my feet for eight hours, lifting and bending. But now I use Microsteps to lower stress, like stopping for breaks to take a few breaths. And when I come home, I’ll work in the yard or watch my grandkids. I’m doing things I really enjoy, like getting together with friends for dinner. There’s always a good conversation and lots of laughter. We support each other. One of my hobbies is shopping at second-hand consignment shops, flea markets, and yard sales. I love browsing and finding amazing treasures at great prices. Another way I relax is curling up with a good movie. And I like listening to music on the radio while I’m driving, and singing along. I also make sure I schedule a massage to totally relax and release all the pain and tension. Being with my grandchildren is a joy — and I have much more energy for them. I babysit for them and I love to read to the younger ones. We’ll build with blocks, do coloring, or just enjoy a movie together. With the older ones, I might be running to a track meet or a soccer game. I’m also connecting with my parents daily. And when I hear them say to me, “We don’t know what I’d do without you,” it brings me to tears, knowing how appreciative they are. There’s still family stress that I deal with, but I’m learning I can’t fix everyone’s problems. I know I have to take a deep breath and not get upset over things I can’t change. I don’t allow worries to linger. I take a break from my phone and focus on things that make me smile, like being with my grandchildren. And I’m focusing on gratitude — I’ll watch a Reset when I feel anxious. I remember to thank my husband for all the things he does to help me at home. I’m more productive at work. I feel good about taking on additional tasks at work. I’m a doer and I know I can do anything I set my mind to. When my manager compliments me on a job well done, I feel great gratitude that I’m appreciated for my hard work, and that being an associate for 31 years has paid off. Small steps lead to big changes. Over the past few months, I’ve learned to put myself first sometimes. I’m continuing with my Thrive journey. I have never been so excited to be part of a group! What a great support system. — Lisa Bell, Walmart Supercenter #1623, Wilkes-Barre, PA; $5K Winner",

    "text": "US presidential hopeful Nikki Haley faced a firestorm of criticism on Thursday after failing to mention slavery as a cause of the American Civil War when asked what led to the conflict at a campaign event.\nLess than three weeks before voting begins in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, it was the first major stumble for a candidate whose campaign has seen her propelled from an unlikely outsider to front-runner Donald Trump 's biggest threat.\nThe former UN ambassador told a town hall crowd on Wednesday in Berlin, New Hampshire, that the cause of the bloody 1861-65 war was “basically how the government was going to run” and “freedoms and what people could and couldn't do”.\nRead more Trump distances himself from Hitler but backs anti-immigration remarks Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley criticises Trump and DeSantis over Ukraine war She added that “it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are”.\nApparently caught off guard, she turned the debate back at the questioner, who responded that he was not the one running for president, and that it was “astonishing” that slavery had not come up in her answer.\nScholars agree that slavery was the main driver of the Civil War and Ms Haley's obfuscation prompted swift rebuttals.\n“It was about slavery,” President Joe Biden said, responding on social media to video footage of the town hall.\nIt was about slavery. https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne\n— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) December 28, 2023 Ms Haley, 51, attempted to clear up her comments in a local radio interview on Thursday in New Hampshire, affirming that “of course the Civil War was about slavery, that's the easy part”.\nShe accused the town hall questioner – who refused to identify himself to reporters – of being a “Democratic plant” sent to damage her campaign and boost Mr Trump, who is considered a weaker prospect against Mr Biden in the general election.\nMr Trump commands a lead of more than 20 points in polling for New Hampshire's January 23 primary, but Ms Haley has been gaining ground – overtaking Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as the former president's biggest threat.\nMs Haley, who has a history of stirring controversy on America's Confederate past, raised eyebrows over her views on the Civil War during her successful run for South Carolina governor in 2010.\nCharacterising the conflict as a fight between “tradition” and “change”, she told a private meeting of Confederate heritage groups there were “passions on different sides”.\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said Ms Haley's latest remarks were “not stunning” to any black residents of South Carolina during her term in office.\nUpdated: December 28, 2023, 10:10 PM",

which can travel at 10 times the speed of sound.\nAddressing the country, Putin said they had used the attack on Ukraine to test Russia's \"newest missile\", an IRBM called \"Oreshnik\".\nBoth are part of the same family as the original RS-24 Yars ICBM -

Moscow could still modify the weapon to carry a nuclear payload.\n“It could be refitted to certainly carry different types of conventional or nuclear warheads,” spokesperson Sabrina Singh warned.\nShe revealed that the move by Russia -

    "text": "Love Holt, a reverend and single mother of five, was rushed to an emergency room in Missouri last year after her mother found her passed out in her car and “covered in blood.” When Holt arrived at the hospital, fear filled her instead of relief.\n“I just kept saying over and over, ‘Don’t f—ing die. Don’t say you took those pills,’” Holt told NBC News. “I was in fear, honestly, that I was going to be carted away from my hospital bed to a jail cell had they found out.”\nA reproductive rights advocate who opposes the state’s near-total abortion ban, Holt, 38, had obtained abortion pills by mail and took them in her home at 13 weeks pregnant. Less than an hour later, she was bleeding heavily, cramping and feeling light-headed. To avoid frightening her children, Holt went outside and sat alone in her car, where she continued to hemorrhage.\nWhen she arrived at the hospital, she told staff she was having a miscarriage but did not say that she had taken abortion pills. She underwent a procedure called a dilation and curettage — commonly referred to as a D&C — to remove the tissue from the uterus.\n“All of these things crossed my mind, like I can’t go to jail. I’m a breadwinner for my family and they need me,” said Holt. She added that she felt lucky that no one at the hospital reported her on suspicion of self-managing an abortion.\nRising Fears Abortion rights advocates say Holt is not alone and that women in the twenty-one states that have banned or restricted abortion since the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022 fear that they will be prosecuted for using abortion pills. Last month, Louisiana became the first state to declare abortion pills dangerous controlled substances and to threaten jail or fines to anyone possessing them without a prescription.\nIf/When/How, a nonprofit national legal advocacy group that supports abortion rights, exclusively told NBC News that its legal helpline recorded an 875% increase in calls in the 6 months after Roe was overturned, compared to the same time in 2021. Calls to the helpline — which assists people concerned about pregnancy outcomes — have continued to rise since then.\nThe top question asked by callers was what are the legal rights and risks for people who take the abortion pills, the group said. Thirty-two percent of the callers were under the age of 18, and most calls were from or about states that limit or ban access to abortion services.\nOnline requests for medication abortions have dramatically increased in those states as well, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association . Most abortions in the U.S. are medication abortions, rising from 53% of abortions in 2020 to 63% in 2024, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortion.\n“There’s this big sense of chaos and confusion, and this reality that your ability to get care in large part now very much depends on not just the state that you live in and the size of your bank account, but whether or not you can navigate substantial logistical and financial burdens to get an abortion,” said Kelly Baden, vice president for public policy at the institute.\nBaden added: “We are in a fearful climate with increased hostility and legal risk for patients, providers and helpers. We have to be prepared for the ongoing targeting and criminalization of people who are seeking abortion care.”\nAll of the abortion bans and restrictions enacted since the overturn of Roe do not call for the prosecution of women who self-manage abortions, like Holt. And leaders of the mainstream anti-abortion groups say their goal is to not punish women who obtain abortions, but many of the new laws do target people who provide or assist in providing abortions.\nMissouri state Sen. Nick Schroer, the Republican co-author of the state’s near-total abortion bans, one of the strictest in the country, said women who get an abortion in the state will not face punitive measures.\n“Case law and our statutes show that women in the state of Missouri will not be prosecuted,”said Schroer. “The only ones that could be held liable are the companies and the physicians that are partaking in this and basically preying upon women of these very sensitive times.”\nBut abortion rights advocates and attorneys warn that women who are self-managing their abortions because of the shuttering of clinics are now at greater risk of being reported, investigated and prosecuted due to stigma, misapplication of the law and criminalization of abortion.\n“People are afraid. People are afraid to even seek information,” said Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel and legal director at If/When/How. “Once a prosecutor decides that they want to punish someone for ending their pregnancy, they’re going to find a way to do so — they’re going to find a law that’s going to fit.”\nHolt’s choice Like many people in states where abortion is illegal, Holt knew she had to look beyond her state lines to get care. She attempted to make an appointment for a medication abortion in Illinois, but there was a four-week wait.\nHolt would need a surgical abortion by then, which would require more resources — like time off from work and money — which she did not have as a single working mother, she said. In order to terminate her pregnancy she needed a “discrete, private and affordable” option, which led her to order the pills online.\nThe initial order was stolen in the mail, according to Holt, and she quickly placed another one. The pills arrived about 18 days later, and Holt took them at home at 13 weeks and six days pregnant, she said, despite it being recommended by the FDA no later than 10 weeks.\n“I didn’t have any other choice. So desperate,” said Holt. “I wouldn’t be able to provide any real stability for my family. I would have been putting myself and my children at risk for not being able to supply them with income and food and housing because my work schedule would be curbed.”\nHolt is grateful that she was able to self-manage her abortion — and get subsequent care at the hospital — without criminalization. But she said others, particularly women of color, haven’t been as fortunate when navigating the shifting abortion landscape.\n“I wish my story was isolated. It saddens me to know that there are stories that are even more egregious than my story,” Holt said. “We’re just caught in the crosshairs. The target isn’t necessarily on our back. But we are the ones who don’t have the resources to take a flight to a safe haven state and get an abortion or pay for the attorneys fees if we get prosecuted in court.”\nPast prosecutions A long history of the prosecution of both abortion providers and women who self-managed their abortions before the overturn of Roe has also fueled fears, advocates say.\nFrom 2000 to 2020, 23 adults were convicted — either by pleading guilty or being found guilty at trial — for charges related to self-managing their abortion or helping someone else get one, including in states from across the political spectrum, like South Carolina, Massachusetts, Maryland, Arizona and Ohio, according to a study published by If/When/How in 2023 that examined public criminal court records and media reports.\nHealth care providers and social workers were most likely to flag a suspected self-managed abortion to authorities, doing so in 45 percent of the cases. No state or federal laws require care professionals to do so, the report said.\nIn most of the cases that led to convictions, medication abortion — either obtained online or received through a friend or relative — was allegedly used.\nNearly half of the adults — 11 of them — faced a range of sentences, from 90 days to up to 20 years in prison. Meanwhile, the rest of those charged were placed on up to 10 years of probation, If/When/How found. The adults pleaded guilty or were found guilty of charges such as abuse of a corpse, child abuse and murder.\nOnly one state — Nevada — criminalizes self-managed abortion after 24-weeks. But people are often investigated and arrested under charges not meant to be applied to allegations of self-managed abortions, such as child abuse, assault of an unborn child, practicing medicine without a license, or homicide and murder, said Diaz-Tello.\nAfter the overturn of Roe, a Nebraska mother, Jessica Burgess , was sentenced to two years in prison in 2023 for giving her pregnant teenage daughter medication for an abortion.\nHer daughter, Celeste Burgess , was also sentenced to 90 days in jail and two years of probation after pleading guilty to concealing or abandoning a dead body.\nHolt’s experience and those of other women drove her to decide to try to fight back politically at the state level. Together with Abortion Action Missouri and other reproductive rights groups, Holt collected enough signatures in May to advance a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.\nMissouri is one of 10 states where organizers are hoping to put abortion rights in state constitutions through citizen-led ballot initiatives, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n“We are able to sweep a lot of things under the rug in Black communities to just try to survive. But this is one that will not be swept under,” Holt said. “And it will affect every one of us in a way.”\nSchroer, the Missouri state senator, said the anti-abortion movement isn’t backing down. “It’s going to be a different fight this year, as Republicans and Democrats, who are wanting to protect life from womb to tomb, are going to do a heck of a lot more education than we saw in those other states.”\nHolt believes the ballot measure will “mobilize and unite communities, and most of all, it’s going to erect a strong force in women like we’ve never seen before.”\n“We know what’s at stake,” she said. “This is going to be like the championship games for us.”\nRead more on this story at NBCNews.com and watch “Hallie Jackson NOW” tonight at 5:30 p.m. ET/4:30 p.m. CT.\nThe post Women increasingly fear being prosecuted for using abortion pills, advocacy groups say appeared first on NBC News .",

    "text": "Lo que necesitas saber:\nAutoridades sanitarias de Suecia han confirmado el primer caso grave de viruela del mono o mpox.\nApenas les contábamos que\nla Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) había decretado emergencia sanitaria otra vez por esta enfermedad y ahora el gobierno de Suecia ha confirmado un primer caso grave de viruela del mono o mpox en su territorio.\nSuecia confirma primer caso grave de viruela del mono\nDe acuerdo con el mismísimo\nMinisterio de Salud y Asuntos Sociales de Suecia, han descubierto un primer caso grave de viruela del mono o mpox en su país. Sí, de acuerdo con las autoridades sanitarias locales, se trata de una persona que buscó atención en la región de Estocolmo.\nAl respecto, agregaron que este primer caso grave esta causado por la variante del virus Clado I, por lo que también representa el primer caso diagnosticado de ésta fuera del continente africano.\n¿Cómo se contagió esta persona?\nSegún el Ministerio de Salud de Suecia, esta persona se infectó de viruela del mono o mpox mientras estaba en una zona de África donde la propagación de esta enfermedad está ocurriendo actualmente.\nSin embargo, las autoridades sanitarias locales han informado que esta persona ya ha recibido tratamiento médico. Sí, eso afirmó Magnus Gisslén, epidemiólogo estatal de la Autoridad de Salud Pública de Suecia.\n¿Qué es la variante Clado I de la viruela del mono?\nDe acuerdo con la OMS, la propagación de la variante Clado I de la viruela del mono ocurre principalmente en la República Democrática del Congo y en países vecinos, por lo que representa una amenaza internacional para la salud humana.\nSobre esta variante, los expertos indican que causa la misma enfermedad básica de mpox que provoca la variante Clado IIb, la cual ya había llegado antes en Suecia. Pero esta vez hay mayor preocupación en el gobierno sueco porque este caso puede estar relacionado con un mayor riesgo y una mayor mortalidad.\n“El anterior brote mundial con la variante del virus Clado IIb se transmitía principalmente a través de contactos sexuales, mientras que el Clado I ahora se transmite en mayor medida a través de otras vías de contacto, principalmente contactos cercanos dentro del hogar y luego, a menudo, a niños“, se lee en el comunicado del Ministerio de Salud de Suecia.\nYa para acabar, las autoridades sanitarias suecas indican que hasta ahora han detectado también cerca de 300 casos de viruela del mono, todos relacionados con la variante Clado IIb. Mientras que en México, según\nla Secretaría de Salud, se han identificado 212 casos probables durante el 2024, de los cuales sólo se han confirmado 49 de la variante Clado IIb distribuidos en 11 estados, “hasta el momento no se ha identificado la nueva variante Clado 1b”.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Amritsar, Dec 29 (IANS) The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Friday slammed the physical depiction of the Sahibzadas, the sons of last Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, in plays by children in schools under the Veer Bal Diwas events announced by the Central government, terming it against Sikh principles and traditions.\nIt has sought an explanation from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) along with the Union Ministries of Education, Culture, and Minority Affairs.\nSGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami said any such anti-Sikh act cannot be accepted.\nHe said any act against Sikh principles, customs, traditions, and values hurts the Sikh mentality and big objections are coming from the Sikh sangat about the enacting the Sahibzadas under the instructions of the Centre government regarding Veer Bal Diwas in educational institutions in various states.\nHe said taking cognisance of these acts against the Sikh principles, the SGPC has asked Union ministries and the CBSE to present their stand.\nDhami said regarding Veer Bal Diwas, according to the order of Akal Takht Sahib, the Union government had already been approached to change the name of this day, but it has not taken it seriously till date.\nHe said the concern of the SGPC and the Sikh sangat in this regard has come true as efforts are being made to make children play the roles of Sahibzadas by going against the Sikh traditions. He said the responsibility of this anti-Sikh phenomenon lies directly on the Union government and the respective state governments.\nSuch actions can never be accepted by the Sikh world and action will also be taken against the educational institutions by identifying them, that have got the characters of Sahibzadas played in physical form, Dhami said.\n--IANS\nvg/vd\nMENAFN29122023000231011071ID1107668053\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Bill Belichick’s reputation working with Patriots cornerbacks precedes him.\nRecently\nclaimed cornerback Marco Wilson was excited to join the Patriots this week because of the team’s history at the position. The Patriots have earned players like Malcolm Butler, J.C. Jackson and Logan Ryan a lot of money in free agency by building them up through their defensive system.\n“These coaches are established with building up cornerbacks, and they have that history,” Wilson told the Herald on Thursday. “You have smart guys running the defense, smart scheme so I feel like I can thrive in that.”\nWilson, 24, was waived by the Cardinals on Tuesday. The Broncos and Titans also put in waiver claims, per ESPN, but the Patriots had top priority, so they were able to add him to their depleted cornerback group.\nWilson, who hadn’t played on defense since Week 11, only contributing in the kicking game, said he was not surprised the Cardinals waived him.\n“I just felt like it just wasn’t a fit for me,” Wilson said. “I feel like it just It wasn’t the place for me to thrive as a player and develop as a player. And that’s fine. I think this is gonna be a good place for me to do so.”\nThe Patriots have lost five cornerbacks throughout the 2023 season. Christian Gonzalez and Marcus Jones are on injured reserve, J.C. Jackson is on the non-football illness list, and Jack Jones and Ameer Speed have been cut. That leaves the secondary with Jonathan Jones, Myles Bryant, Shaun Wade and rookie Alex Austin, who didn’t begin the season with the Patriots.\nBased on defensive snaps, Wilson, a 2021 fourth-round pick out of Florida, is now the second-most experienced cornerback on the Patriots’ 53-man roster behind Jonathan Jones. He believes he could contribute quickly.\n“I’m a pretty fast learner and whatever they they need me to do, I’m willing to go out there and get my my hands on the field to help my team,” Wilson said.\nWilson said the Patriots’ defense is similar to what the Cardinals ran in 2021 and 2022 with Vance Joseph as defensive coordinator.\nHe’s happy to play for a coaching legend like Bill Belichick.\n“Established guy, the greatest in the game,” Wilson said. “The best coach in the NFL, so I’m excited to be able to be coached by him and not just watch them beat teams now.”\nBarmore admits was his best: Defensive tackle Christian Barmore was initially reluctant to call Sunday night’s win over the Broncos the best game of his NFL career.\nBarmore sacked Broncos QB Russell Wilson three times in the 26-23 win. One of those was a strip sack, and he also had a QB hit and two tackles for loss.\n“No. Keep going. There were some plays I wish I could have had,” Barmore told reporters Thursday. “And just about keep getting better, keep doing better every game. That’s my goal. Every game do better.”\nEventually, however, he agreed when a reporter asked if him that wasn’t his best game, then what was?\n“I mean, you right,” Barmore said. “Denver, three sacks, that is a lot. I’d say that’s really one of my best, but I like the Chiefs too, especially Buffalo when we first played them.\n“It’s all about doing better than every game I’ve played. That’s my goal.”\nInjury news: Running back Ezekiel Elliott missed practice Thursday with an illness and was one of five players to sit out.\nLeft tackle Trent Brown did not participate for a second day due to illness, though he was present for the start of practice. Safeties Jalen Mills and Jabrill Peppers were out for a second straight day. Wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was sidelined by a lingering ankle injury.",
