    "title": "Bombay High Court Seeks Response From Union Govt On Ban Of 23 Dog Breeds",
    "text": "The Bombay High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Central government and the Maharashtra government and sought their responses to a public interest litigation (PIL) petition challenging the circular imposing a ban on 23 breeds of dogs.\nThe Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying (Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying) issued a circular on March 12 asking all the states to ensure that no licences or permissions are issued for the sale, breeding, and keeping of certain dog breeds \"dangerous for human life\".\nA Pune - based NGO Animal Rescue Trust has approached the high court seeking quashing of the circular. In the interim, it has sought stay on the implementation of the circular stating that the ban is arbitrary and bad in law.\nThe bench, however, noted that the Calcutta bench has already granted a partial stay on the circular. \"No further executive order or decision has been taken by any authority in Maharashtra based on that circular. We want to first see what the Union government has to say,\" a bench of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Arif Doctor said.\nBombay HC Quashes FIR Against Owners Of Luxury And Sports Cars In Jan 26 BKC Rally Bombay HC Seeks Union Government&apos;s Response\nThe plea claimed that the ban has been imposed on 23 different dog breeds without inviting suggestions from all the stakeholders. \"The circular is non-factual without any scientific proof of ferocity of the said breeds and is based on a random dog bite incident,\" the plea read.\nIt pointed out that similar petitions challenging the circulars, wherein some high courts have stayed the implementation of the circular.\nThe ban lacks any scientific study, empirical evidence or a comprehensive study and is hence arbitrary. Such a ban would aggravate cruelty against such breeds, the PIL added.\nPregnancy Termination Case: Bombay HC Asks Medical Board&apos;s Opinion On Selected Foetal Reduction Bombay High Court to Hear Case on June 24\nThe circular, that was issued based on recommendations from an Expert Committee, prohibits the importing, breeding, selling, and keeping of certain dog breeds, including cross-breeds, citing concerns about their potential danger to human life. The local bodies were directed to enforce the ban and sterilise existing pets of the prohibited breeds.\nThe circular mentioned \"breeds (including mixed and cross breeds) like Pitbull Terrier, Tosa Inu, American Staffordshire Terrier, Fila Brasileiro, Dogo Argentino, American Bulldog, Boerboel, Kangal, Central Asian Shepherd Dog (ovcharka), Caucasian Shepherd Dog (ovcharka), South Russian Shepherd Dog (ovcharka), Tornjak, Sarplaninac, Japanese Tosa and Akita, Mastiffs (boerbulls), Rottweiler, Terriers, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Wolf Dogs, Canario, Akbash dog, Moscow Guard dog, Cane corso, and every dog of the type commonly known as a Ban Dog (or Bandog)\".\nThe HC has make the matter for hearing on June 24.",

Ventura isn't the only place experiencing tumultuous coasts. The National Weather Service has issued surf and flooding advisories along the California coast and in Hawaii. A video from Ventura officials opens on a seemingly tranquil scene. People are scattered along the seawall, leaning against it and watching the rolling waves in the distance. Suddenly, people start to back away from the wall moments before a wave spikes up in front of them. As it crashes down into the street, many of the people running get their feet knocked out from under them and a truck seems to skip forward in the waves. Another angle captured by [Facebook user Colin Hoag shows the waves chasing him](https://www.facebook.com/1 103854833/videos/339998562146021/) down the street.

    "text": "Cette prestigieuse compétition regroupe les sept meilleures formations universitaires canadiennes en plus de l’équipe hôtesse dans une formule à élimination directe. En raison de son éliminatoire hâtive, la troupe de Patrick Grandmaître a été répertoriée au huitième et dernier rang. Elle a été balayée au deuxième tour éliminatoire par les Gaels de l’Université Queen’s.\n«Nous avons été déçus pendant 48 heures. Dès le lundi matin, nous nous sommes dit que nous étions chanceux d’avoir une deuxième chance cette saison, quelque chose qui sort de l’ordinaire», a raconté le pilote de l’équipe hôtesse.\nLes Gee-Gees ont donc hérité de trois semaines de préparation sans match. Celles-ci ont été divisées en trois étapes bien définies par le groupe d’entraîneurs. «C’était le conditionnement physique, la technique et le volet stratégique. Ce n’est pas très long trois semaines. Ça nous a permis de reposer quelques blessures. Nous pensons que nous avons fait tout ce que nous devions faire.»\nBien préparés\nRien n’a été laissé au hasard dans la préparation et avec raison. Ottawa croisera le fer avec nul autre que les doubles champions en titre du circuit Atlantic University Sport et de la Coupe universitaire U Sports, les Reds de l’Université du Nouveau-Brunswick (UNB). La formation des Maritimes n’a perdu que deux de ses 60 derniers matchs en saison régulière. Au passage, elle a inscrit 343 buts contre seulement 95 accordés.\nLe pilote des Ottaviens n’a pas vu le véritable visage des siens au deuxième tour éliminatoire. Il souhaite le voir dès les premiers instants du duel face aux Reds qui s’annonce tout sauf évident.\n«Nous avons accordé trop de chances de marquer en relance. Notre jeu en zone défensive a été bon, mais nous n’avons pas aimé notre jeu de transition. Nous avons ajusté quelques trucs. L’une des grandes forces de UNB c’est la pression qu’ils appliquent. Ils n’arrêtent pas tant que l’autre équipe ne craque pas. J’ai hâte de voir de quelle façon nous allons répondre.»\nLa rencontre sera présentée à 19 h, ce jeudi, à la Place TD d’Ottawa. L’équipe gagnante accédera à la demi-finale tandis que la perdante verra sa saison prendre fin.",

    "text": "Last Monday, Yankees manager Aaron Boone got ejected in a pretty unusual way during that day's game against the Oakland Athletics after a fan shouted and talked trash to home umpire Hunter Wendelstedt, who thought it was the Yankees skipper who said it and ejected him.\nUnderstandably, Boone was not pleased with this turn of events . It's a situation that could have happened to anyone, and it's unfortunate that Wendelstedt might face consequences for a mistake that wasn't his fault.\nAs Mark W. Sanchez of The New York Post reports, Major League Baseball was less than pleased with Wendelstedt's handling of the situation. While he may not face immediate penalties, the incident could have long-term implications for his career, potentially affecting future assignments and opportunities.\nWendelstedt might face consequences after all SNY revealed on Wednesday that MLB conducts thorough evaluations of every umpire's performance. These assessments, used to determine playoff assignments and All-Star selections, ensure a fair and balanced approach. Unfortunately, Wendelstedt's alleged poor performance may result in missed opportunities.\nThere has been a growing concern about the performance of umpires since the start of the season. Fans, players, and coaches alike have been vocal about questionable calls and poor performances from notable umpires such as Angel Hernández.\nWhile umpires are expected to make some mistakes, the frequency of such errors this season has raised concerns and put these officials under a microscope.",

    "text": "Auctioneers raided the home of a Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) reverend in Marururui, Nairobi on Thursday, February 23, to recover a Ksh7 million loan. The officials hired by a creditor accused the clergy of defaulting on a Ksh5 million loan secured in 2019. Following his default, the auctioneers sought a court order to recover their money after a back-and-forth with the debtor. \"He guaranteed some money up to the tune of Ksh5 million, but he failed to honour his obligation of repaying those loans after he had guaranteed,\" one of the lead auctioneers stated. \"So we went back to court and got orders that he should pay that money plus the interest that comes to around ksh7 million,\" he added. After being granted the green light to proceed with the recovery, the auctioneers informed the clergy of their intention to enforce the order. \"We managed to proclaim some [household items, and some motor vehicles](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/90031-businessman-announces-mass-auction-cars-over-debt-low-ksh-68k), and very soon will proceed with the sale of the items,\" \"Today we have secured a very big victory for our clients, who were guarantors of the reverend,\" the auctioneers stated. According to the latest data released by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), [loan default surged to 16% in August 2023](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/93506-nairobi-palatial-homes-put-auction) amidst an increase in the cost of living. This translated to Ksh596 billion in defaults, forcing the banking sector to increase interest rates to cushion themselves from attracting defaulters. CBK further highlighted that most of the defaulted loans were across the mining, manufacturing, real estate and building and construction sectors. Over the last two months, auctioneers also increased their recovery rate [ judging by the newspaper pages dominated by auction adverts](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/95761-nairobi-posh-estates-were-hit-hardest-tycoon-auctions). Most of the property on sale were mansions, cars, and parcels of land countrywide.

    "text": "Greening Future Generation (GFG) in celebrating Environmental Awareness Month launched a roll-out of My Mess, My Responsibility, My Livelihood 2023 campaign on June 27 at Phiri Community Hall.\nThe event was held to address critical environmental issues impacting Soweto through illegal dumping and other forms of pollution which threaten the ecosystem and residents’ livelihood.\nGFG partnered with the City of Johannesburg in line with their Growth and Development Strategy (GDS 2040), Pickitup, Local Councillors for Ward 15 and 16, and Mrs eSoweto Sharleen Jones who is the ambassador of the campaign.\nSilence Ntshatsha who is the manager of Pickitup stated that it was an honour for them to be part of the event.\nShe also mentioned that such initiatives are very important in the community and that it is time that people know how to handle waste because there’s currently a dumping crisis in Soweto.\n“Over five places have problems with dumping including Phiri.\n“This launch in partnership with us as Pickitup is truly a great honour seeing that there are people out there who appreciate taking care of the environment and reducing waste amongst communities,” said Ntshatsha.\nMrs eSoweto in partnership with the GFG campaign has promised to inspire and engage with the community towards taking ownership and responsibility of their environment.\n“It is such a blessing to be here today as we celebrate Environmental Awareness Month.\n“As I was driving, I came across a guy driving and he threw away a bottle after consuming what he was consuming and I felt offended by his action because that is not only pollution but also, he could’ve harmed anyone passing by.\n“It is important to have such events to teach such people about certain actions especially if they harm the environment,” said Jones.\nGFG hosted a five-day event from June 24 to the 28.\nThe event had a workshop session and two environmental education blitzes hosted in Mapetla, Phiri, and Senaone, stakeholder engagement and launch. A 5km marathon where they were transforming illegal dumping sites into community assets was also part of the campaign.",

    "text": "Un amoncellement de dossards presse en sang: Reporters sans frontières a lancé jeudi une série d'opérations coup de poing à travers le monde en hommage aux journalistes tués à Gaza, où l'information est en péril selon l'ONG.\"Au rythme où les journalistes sont tués à Gaza, il n'y aura bientôt plus personne pour vous informer\", pouvait-on lire jeudi matin sur une banderole affichée par ses membres sur le parvis des Droits de l'Homme à Paris. Ils ont aussi empilé des dossards ensanglantés sur fond de tour Eiffel, a constaté l'AFP.Des actions similaires étaient prévues en Allemagne, au Royaume-Uni, au Brésil, en Espagne, aux Etats-Unis, au Sénégal, en Tunisie, en Suisse et à Taïwan. Selon RSF, plus de 130 journalistes ont été tués à Gaza par des frappes israéliennes depuis le 7 octobre 2023, dont au moins 32 dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions.\"Nous demandons la protection des journalistes de Gaza, la fin de l'impunité et l'ouverture de la bande aux journalistes étrangers. Il en va de notre droit à l'information\", a fait valoir Thibaut Bruttin, directeur général de l'ONG.RSF a déposé quatre plaintes auprès de la Cour pénale internationale (CPI) pour \"crimes de guerre commis par Israël contre des journalistes\" à Gaza.Début janvier, le procureur de la CPI avait déclaré que les crimes contre les journalistes étaient inclus dans son enquête sur des crimes de guerre à Gaza.La bande de Gaza est depuis un an la cible de bombardements israéliens dévastateurs et meurtriers, une guerre déclenchée par l'attaque sans précédent du Hamas, qui y est au pouvoir depuis 2007, dans le sud d'Israël le 7 octobre 2023.Cette attaque a entraîné la mort de 1.205 personnes, majoritairement des civils, selon un décompte de l'AFP basé sur des données officielles israéliennes qui inclut les otages morts ou tués en captivité à Gaza.En riposte, l'offensive militaire israélienne sur Gaza a fait au moins 41.495 morts, en majorité des civils, selon les données du ministère de la Santé du gouvernement du Hamas, jugées fiables par l'ONU.Le conflit s'est élargi et fait craindre une escalade régionale, alors qu'Israël multiplie depuis plusieurs jours les bombardements aériens sur le Liban, disant viser des caches d'armes et installations du mouvement islamiste Hezbollah soutenu par l'Iran et allié du Hamas.",
