    "text": "Queenslandhas sweltered through its hottest December day in four years but residents are warned of another round of destructive storms this weekend.\nThe hot weather impacted much of northern Australia, with temperatures climbing into the mid-to-high 40s in some areas, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.\nBrisbane reached 38.3 degrees marking the hottest December day since 2019.\nIt comes as eastern states embark on a clean-up mission following severe weather and brace for potentially more dangerous, stormy conditions.\nFurther severe weather has been forecast for parts of eastern Australia for the final weekend of 2023, with severe thunderstorms expected to redevelop across eastern Queensland and northeast New South Wales from Saturday into the New Year.\nThere is a risk of severe thunderstorms across Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions in New South Wales, and across south-east and central Queensland.\nWhile the conditions from storms earlier this week have eased, BOM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms would develop from Queensland all the way to Victoria and South Australia.\n\"There are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday,\" Scully said.\n\"Everyone is encouraged to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings.\"\nAs severe thunderstorms develop across the east, heatwaves are also expected across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.\nParts of Western Australia are forecast to reach 49 degrees on Saturday and in the Northern Territory, low to severe-intensity heatwave conditions will cover most areas.\nExtreme heatwave conditions have been forecast for parts of northern Queensland, while low to locally severe heatwave conditions are building around Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and Cairns.\nMeanwhile, the Gold Coast's Movie World has reopened after the Christmas Day storm caused trees to fall around rides and rollercoasters.\nVillage Roadshow's chief operating officer Bikash Randhawa said he had not seen a storm like it in 30 years.\n\"It came from nowhere ... It hit us pretty hard,\" Randhawa said.\n\"We would not open if things were not safe.\n\"That's the reason why Paradise Country (a section of the park) is still closed.\n\"It will be closed until we assess the damage and it is deemed safe for people to come in.\"\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has been criticised for not putting out more warnings before the storm.\nEnergex aims to have 90 per cent of households reconnected to power by December 31.\nResidents in Mount Tambourine and Jimboomba will need their systems rebuilt so will have a much longer wait for electricity.\nThe storm was described as an \"unprecedented disaster\" by the state's police commissioner yesterday.\nFinancial assistance of $180 per person and $900 for families has been made available by the state government.\nSix people have died from the storms in the state over the festive period.",

    "title": "India's disaster management moving forward with 'zero casualty' approach: Amit Shah",
    "text": "While making an appeal to all the states and the union territories to timely implement the advisories issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) for flood management, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that India's disaster management is moving forward with a 'zero casualty' approach under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. HM Shah made the remarks while chairing a high-level meeting in Delhi to review the preparedness of flood management in the country. The Home Minister also reviewed long-term measures to formulate a comprehensive and far-reaching policy to mitigate the menace of floods in the country. The Home Minister directed the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Central Water Commission (CWC) to complete the process of recalibrating all the equipment used in flood forecasts at the earliest. New technologies being adopted by all the agencies and the expansion of their network for flood management were also discussed during the meeting. HM Shah reviewed the action taken on the decisions made in the meeting held last year, and also reviewed the preparations to deal with the Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). He emphasised on optimum use of satellite imagery provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by various agencies for flood and water management. Instructing concerned departments to conduct a detailed study of the recent floods in Sikkim and Manipur and submit a report to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Home Minister also directed to ensure that floodgates of all the major dams are in good condition. He mentioned during the meeting that the flood monitoring centres of the CWC should be in accordance with the country's requirements and of international standards. It was mentioned during the meeting that the non-perennial rivers are prone to more soil erosion and siltation, resulting in floods. The Home Minister directed that efforts should be made to upgrade the forecast system of water level of rivers for better flood management. He said that a natural drainage system should be an integral part of the designs of road construction to deal with inundation of roads, in case of floods. HM Shah said that at least 50 large ponds in the Northeast should be constructed so that the water of the Brahmaputra River could be diverted and stored in those ponds. This will help in developing agriculture, irrigation and tourism in those areas at a low cost and also help in tackling the floods, and will eventually benefit the local economy. HM Shah also instructed the NDMA and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to take appropriate precautionary measures to prevent incidents of forest fire. For this, he stressed the need to regularly create fire lines, remove dry leaves and conduct mock drills from time to time with local residents and forest personnel. Along with this, he also asked to analyse the incidents of repeated forest fires at the same place. The Home Minister also asked the NDMA to prepare a detailed manual to deal with incidents of forest fires. The Home Minister directed that the IMD's alerts regarding lightning strikes should be disseminated to the public on time through SMS, TV, FM radio and other mediums. He emphasised on the need to integrate weather, rainfall and flood warning related apps developed by various departments so that their benefits could reach the targeted population. The MHA detailed that during the meeting, IMD, CWC, NDRF and NDMA made detailed presentations. The departments also apprised about their preparedness for the current monsoon season and future action plan. Union Minister for Jal Shakti C.R. Paatil, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, Home Secretary, Secretaries of Ministries and Departments of River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Earth Sciences, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Road Transport and Highways, Chairperson Railway Board, Members and Heads of Departments of NDMA, Directors General of NDRF and IMD, Chairman NHAI and senior officers from other concerned departments including CWC were present in the meeting.",

    "text": "Turkey fines popular TV series after religious controversy Turkey’s radio and television watchdog RTUK on Thursday placed a two-week broadcasting ban on the popular television series “Kizil Goncalar” (Crimson Buds), a board member said, as it was deemed to be against “society’s national and spiritual values.” Ilhan Tasci, a member of the RTUK board representing the main opposition, said on social media platform X that the regulator had also imposed a 3% administrative fine on broadcaster Fox TV, owned by Walt Disney Co. unit Fox Networks Group. “Kizil Goncalar,” which highlights the division between religious and secular segments of society, faced immediate backlash after it was first aired on December 18, even though its first two episodes topped ratings lists and had more than 10 million views on YouTube. RTUK has often penalized shows over what it has labeled as violations of Turkey’s moral values, the structure of family, or other issues it considers to be unethical, namely LGBTQ+ rights. Its critics and opposition parties have criticized it for curbing freedoms. The show’s producer, Faruk Turgut, said the series reflected the sociological reality of Turkey, portraying the clash between secular and religious segments of society. “I am trying to hold a mirror on the realities of Turkish society. The realities must be discussed, we cannot progress by ignoring them,” Turgut was quoted by daily Hurriyet as saying. “They declared war on us, but we will fight until the end.” Ebubekir Sahin, RTUK chairman and a member of President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling AK Party, wrote on X that outraged viewers had called for the cancellation of the show, and that its posters on billboards in Istanbul had been vandalized with black paint. Pro-government media accused the show of being Islamophobic, prompting the cancellation of filming venue permits for upcoming episodes. The Ismailaga Brotherhood, a prominent religious sect in Turkey, sharply criticized the series. “Productions in today’s media that target our religion and devout individuals by aiming to denigrate the names of Allah, our noble book the Quran, spiritual institutions such as sects and orders, are absolutely unacceptable,” the sect said on X. Tasci said the “RTUK has bowed down to cults and sects.” [Reuters]",

    "text": "Uncertainty Grips Iccrea Cooperative Banking Group As Strike Looms Rome, November 30, 2024 – A one-day strike has been confirmed across companies within the direct perimeter of the Iccrea Cooperative Banking Group on Monday, December 2nd, fueled by growing anxieties among workers. The nationwide action is a direct response to what unions perceive as a series of alarming decisions impacting both employment security and professional standards within the group.\nFirst Cisl , representing the collective voice of Iccrea employees, has expressed deep concern over what they describe as a deteriorating relationship between management and the unions. First Cisl responsible secretaries Sylvia Lambertini and Stefano Del Giudice underscore the complex nature of the issues at hand, stating: \"What worries us is the continuous and constant deterioration of relations between the employers and trade unions. This, also in light of the prospect that would indicate the outsourcing of ‘Bcc Sistemi Informatici’ as only the first of a long series.\"\nThe pensioners’ union, First Cisl, has outlined the specific grievances contributing to this growing discontent. The concerns include:\nPotential Sale of Bcc Sistemi Informatici Workers: Fear of job losses is widespread, driven by anxieties surrounding the rumored sale of a portion of Bcc Sistemi Informatici’s workforce to an entity external to the Cooperative Credit.\nUnilateral Implementation of Smart Working: An uneven application of smart working policies, disadvantaging employees located in smaller regional offices, has sparked accusations of unfair treatment.\nImposition of Banking Conditions on Employees: Workers have been critical of the recent imposition of banking mortgage and current account conditions tailored to group employees, creating a sense of unwanted financial vulnerability.\nAlgorithmic Concerns in Performance Assessments: Doubts have emerged regarding the fairness and transparency of performance reviews, attributed to the adoption of corrective measures and algorithms which they claim have resulted in economic detriment to some employees.\nCancellation of Presence Detection Agreement: The 2017 agreement outlining protocols for documenting employee presence has been unilaterally revoked, leading to concerns about monitoring and accountability. First Cisl asserts that these concerns are not simply isolated incidents but represent a broader pattern of unilateral decision-making by the Iccrea Cooperative Banking Group that undermines the very principles of cooperative banking.\nIn a strong statement defending the rights of its members, the union declares: \"First Cisl, together with the entire union table, is not willing to sacrifice workers on the altar of mere economic convenience to the detriment of the employment levels and professionalism existing within the scope of the cooperation. This, also in light of an economic and banking context which for several years has allowed the entire Iccrea Cooperative Group to present financial statements and profits never recorded in recent decades.\"\nThe union emphasizes its commitment to upholding the distinctive features of a predominantly mutual banking system. They argue that decisions made by the Iccrea Cooperative Banking Group should prioritize the wellbeing of both its employees and its members.\nFirst Cisl concludes with a firm commitment: \"The Iccrea Cooperative Banking Group must be able to demonstrate, also in the industrial policies aimed at the companies of its direct perimeter, the distinctive features of a predominantly mutual banking system\".\nThe fate of Monday’s strike now hangs in the balance as the Iccrea Cooperative Banking Group grapples with these mounting concerns. Will the banking giant acknowledge the grievances of its workforce and initiate a dialogue to find a mutually acceptable solution? Only time will tell.\nWhat impact could the potential sale ‍of Bcc⁢ Sistemi Informatici‌ have on Iccrea workers and the banking sector ‍as a whole? ‌ ## Uncertainty Looms over ⁤Iccrea Cooperative Banking Group as Strike Looms\n**Interviewer:** Joining us today to discuss the upcoming‍ strike at Iccrea Cooperative Banking Group is [Guest Name], an expert on labor relations in the ⁣Italian banking sector. Welcome to the program.\n**Guest:** Thank you for having me.\n**Interviewer:** A one-day strike is scheduled for December 2nd. What are the key ⁢factors driving this industrial ⁤action?\n**Guest:** The situation at Iccrea is complex. As outlined by First Cisl, the union ​representing Iccrea workers, employee anxiety stems from several issues. Primarily, there’s⁣ growing ⁣concern over the potential sale of a portion ​of Bcc Sistemi Informatici, ⁣a subsidiary of the group, and what this means for ⁤job security.\n**Interviewer:** So, job losses are a major fear?\n**Guest:** Absolutely. The ⁤rumor of outsourcing has created a climate of uncertainty and fear among workers.\n**Interviewer:** First ‌Cisl has also raised concerns about the implementation of smart working policies. Can you elaborate on that?\n**Guest:** There seems to be an uneven application of smart working across different offices, with employees in smaller regional branches feeling disadvantaged. This has sparked accusations of unfair treatment and a lack of‌ consistent policies.\n**Interviewer:** What are some of the ⁣other grievances you’ve heard about?\n**Guest:** Workers are also unhappy about being subjected to banking-specific mortgage⁣ and current account conditions. They feel this creates unnecessary financial vulnerability.\nFurthermore, there appears to be​ apprehension regarding the use of algorithms in performance evaluations. Some employees believe these algorithms lack transparency and have ⁣resulted in financial​ disadvantages for some.\n**Interviewer:** This⁢ sounds like a difficult situation for all involved. What can we expect to happen on December 2nd?\n**Guest:** It’s difficult to predict the ‌outcome of‌ the strike. It will depend on‌ how both sides, management and unions, approach negotiations. Hopefully, this action will prompt open dialog and lead to a resolution that addresses the concerns of Iccrea workers.",
