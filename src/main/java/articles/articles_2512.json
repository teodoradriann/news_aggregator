    "title": "This Tiny Palm-Sized Drone is the Future of Battlefield Surveillance and Military Recon",
    "text": "Quite reminiscent of the Hunter-seeker drones from the DUNE movie series, the Black Hornet 4 is shaping up to be an incredibly small yet exceptionally handy recon drone, capable of flying into areas unnoticed, and helping perform important surveillance required during military strategy and battle planning. This miniature marvel, weighing a mere 70 grams, packs a powerful array of features. Equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, superior low-light performance, and a high-resolution thermal imager, the Black Hornet 4 empowers soldiers with exceptional situational awareness on the ground.\nDesigner: Teledyne FLIR\nHowever, its true potential lies in its ability to excel in challenging environments. Boasting a flight time exceeding 30 minutes, a range surpassing 2 kilometers, and the capability to withstand strong winds, the Black Hornet 4 navigates even the most demanding situations with ease. Additionally, its low visual and audible signature makes it ideal for covert operations, allowing for discreet deployment and data collection. The system’s ability to function in GPS-denied environments adds another layer of versatility, ensuring reliable operation regardless of external factors.\nThis innovative technology has already seen significant global adoption, with over 20,000 units deployed. The recent contract awarded by the U.S. Army for additional systems further underscores the Black Hornet 4’s impact. This tiny tech marvel represents a significant leap forward in the realm of personal reconnaissance, offering soldiers unprecedented capabilities and operational flexibility.\nBeyond its military applications, the potential of the Black Hornet 4 extends to various civilian sectors. Search and rescue operations in disaster zones, environmental monitoring in remote areas, and even industrial inspections in hazardous environments could all benefit from the capabilities of this miniature marvel. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see the Black Hornet 4, or similar systems, playing an increasingly crucial role in diverse fields, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of miniaturized aerial technology.",

ASHEVILLE, N.C. - Jansen and Travis Putnam had planned their dream wedding. They were set to get married at the iconic Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina , on Sept. 28, in front of 170 guests.\nThen, Tropical Storm Helene hit , and the couple found themselves stuck at the hotel: They had to tell their 170 guests the wedding would be canceled.\n\"We were on the grounds of the Biltmore Estate, so at that point they had pretty much informed us that it wasn’t safe to leave and it wasn’t safe for people to get on the grounds either, so people couldn’t come in,\" Jansen said in an interview with LiveNow from FOX .\nBut the Biltmore staff and other guests who couldn’t leave the estate weren’t going to let a storm hamper the couple’s big day, even if the hotel was without electricity and water.\nRELATED: Nearly 200 miles of historic Blue Ridge Parkway reopens in Appalachia following Helene\nOne of the staff members at the Biltmore got ordained just so she could marry them. They made a flower bouquet for the bride that was wrapped in napkins. A photographer who happened to also be stuck at the estate took photos for them on her iPhone. A family friend did Jansen’s hair and makeup, while the Biltmore staff and guests rearranged the courtyard so they had an aisle to walk down. Hotel guests and staff attended the impromptu ceremony.\nJansen and Travis Putnam (Moments by MCQ)\n\"Not only did people come together, but it looked so good when it did come together. I mean, it was absolutely beautiful. It was more than what we could have ever hoped for,\" Jansen said.\nRELATED: Concert for Carolina to raise money for Hurricane Helene victims\n\"There were a lot of tears, a lot of happy tears … you know, people went out of their way just to make something special for us when we really hadn&apos;t even had a chance to think about us still getting married on that day,\" Jansen recalled.\nThe Biltmore Estate was built by George Vanderbilt in the 1890s and hosts about 175 weddings a year, according to The Asheville Citizen Times . The 8,000-acre estate, one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations, has been closed since Helene devastated Asheville and surrounding areas .\nThe Biltmore Estate, the largest privately owned home in America, built by George Vanderbilt between 1889 and 1895, is one of area's major tourist draws as viewed on October 20, 2016 in Asheville, North Carolina. It remained closed as of Oct. 11 due\nExpand At least 72 people died in Buncombe County where Biltmore is located, according to NPR . Some 200 people were unaccounted for as of Oct. 3, but dozens of people have been rescued since then.\nRELATED: Helene kills 11 members of the same family after mudslide destroys their community\nIn a social media post, Biltmore staff said forested areas had extensive wind damage, and the entrance to Biltmore in Biltmore Village had significant flooding and damage to buildings.\nThe winery, gardens and hotels sustained minimal damage, the estate said. Sadly, a few of their animals died during the storm.\nBut through the bad, there is always good, as the Putnams experienced firsthand.\n\"We were just overwhelmed about how people could do that for us,\" Travis said. \"We were just happy that we were able to get married.\"\nThe Source This story includes information from the Putnams, Biltmore Estate and NPR.",

    "text": "Este jueves, el Tribunal Supremo de Israel dictaminó que las parejas del mismo sexo pueden adoptar niños en igualdad de condiciones a las parejas heterosexuales, una decisión que se ve como \"una victoria histórica\" para el colectivo [LGTB](https://lasillarota.com/mundo/2023/6/23/15-libros-para-celebrar-la-diversidad-fomentar-proposito-de-la-marcha-lgbt-434768.html) del país. Por medio de su cuenta de 'X', Aguda Israel, la entidad representativa de la comunidad LGBT en Israel, celebró el hecho tras tres años de lucha para que esto fuera posible y lo catalogó como una \"gota de esperanza en estos días difíciles\". \"Tras años de lucha, el Tribunal Superior de Justicia cancela la discriminación contra las parejas LGTB en el proceso de adopción\", celebró la entidad, que presentó un recurso ante la Justicia junto a la ONG Centro de Reforma y Casa Abierta para el Orgullo y la Tolerancia de Jerusalén. [ÚNETE A NUESTRO CANAL DE WHATSAPP. EL PODER DE LA INFORMACIÓN EN LA PALMA DE TU MANO](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6evSkGk1Ftej78ks0B) \"Durante años hemos estado luchando y peleando para ser vistos como iguales a la hora de adoptar niños y formar una familia en Israel, mientras que los gobiernos israelíes durante generaciones nos han discriminado e incitado sólo por lo que somos, el Tribunal Supremo demuestra una vez más su importancia en la protección de nuestros derechos\". \"Sólo un hombre y su esposa juntos\" Hasta ahora, la legislación establecía que sólo \"un hombre y su esposa juntos\" podían adoptar, y las parejas del mismo sexo podían hacerlo solamente bajo dos criterios excepcionales: si uno de los cónyuges era padre biológico del niño, o si los padres habían muerto y el menor a adoptar era un pariente, según el diario local Haaretz. Ante ello, en su sentencia de hoy, el Supremo dictaminó que las parejas heterosexuales no tendrán prioridad en el proceso de adopción, en una decisión tomada de forma unánime que marca una nueva interpretación de la ley sobre el ámbito vigente desde 1981. Según Aguda Israel, la decisión de hoy es también una \"respuesta a la homofobia y el odio\" que relegó a los homosexuales a \"ciudadanos de segunda clase\". \"Este día es la respuesta a la homofobia, el odio, la oscuridad y los ministros de bienestar que durante años negaron nuestra filiación, dejándonos como ciudadanos de segunda clase\". \"La guerra sólo puso de relieve lo desconectada que está la desigualdad de la vida misma. Ha llegado la hora de la igualdad de derechos en la legislación primaria de la Knesset: en la paternidad, en la seguridad, en el matrimonio, sin incitación ni discriminación, y seguiremos marchando con orgullo hasta que lo consigamos\". \"Llegó el momento de la igualdad de derechos en la paternidad, la seguridad, el matrimonio, sin incitación ni discriminación, y seguiremos marchando con orgullo hasta llegar ahí\", agregó Aguda. Israel es considerado como el país más abierto en la región hacia la comunidad LGBT, aunque a su vez tiene sectores religiosos judíos fuertemente conservadores que se oponen a este colectivo, aún sometido a muchas limitaciones en cuestión de derechos civiles. A su vez, la coalición de gobierno de Benjamín Netanyahu, formada en parte por ministros de ultraderecha y abiertamente homófobos, es considerada de las más contrarias al colectivo LGTB en la historia reciente de Israel.",

The next installment will be available for streaming starting on February 6, 2025.\nCheck out the Sweet Magnolias Season 4 trailer below ( watch more trailers ):\nWhat happens in the Sweet Magnolias Season 4 trailer?

The ensemble cast includes JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Brooke Elliott, Heather Headley, Logan Allen, Anneliese Judge, Carson Rowland, Dion Johnstone, Brandon Quinn, Jamie Lynn Spears, and Chris Medlin with Justin Bruening.\nSweet Magnolias is created and executive produced by showrunner Sheryl J.

As the men in their lives pursue their own dreams and the teenagers take uneasy steps toward adulthood, the Magnolias support each other with creative problem-solving, deep-hearted commitment, and — as always — weekly margaritas.”",

    "text": "Jon Lester's return to the Boston Red Sox as a guest instructor for spring training marked a significant moment for both the former pitcher and the team. With Craig Breslow's initiative, the Red Sox welcomed Lester, alongside baseball legends like Pedro Martinez, into a revamped pitching support staff. This move not only highlights the team's commitment to leveraging the experience of its alumni but also symbolizes Lester's reconciliation with the franchise.\nRekindling Old Flames\nAfter an acrimonious split in 2014 following unsuccessful contract negotiations, Lester's relationship with the Red Sox had been strained. However, the passage of time and the outreach from old teammates in new management roles have healed old wounds. Lester's inclusion in the spring training roster as a guest instructor is a testament to the enduring bonds formed through shared triumphs, including two World Series championships. It also underscores the maturity and perspective gained with time, both by Lester and the organization.\nA New Chapter Begins\nLester's first day back in the fold was filled with nostalgia, learning, and acclimation to new roles and terminologies. His presence, along with that of Martinez, Ortiz, and Evans, adds a rich layer of history and expertise to the Red Sox's coaching staff. The decision to bring back these legends speaks volumes about the team's philosophy of blending tradition with innovation. Lester's perspective on the game, shaped by both his illustrious playing career and his recent experiences away from Fenway Park, offers valuable insights to current players.\nLegacy and Future\nThe reunion at spring training not only serves as a bridge between the Red Sox's storied past and its promising future but also offers a model for other organizations on the importance of maintaining connections with their heritage. Lester's return is emblematic of the potential for growth and reconciliation in professional relationships, illustrating how respect and appreciation for one's contributions can transcend temporary disagreements. As the Red Sox continue to build their team for the upcoming season, the wisdom imparted by their returning heroes will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the next generation of players.",

    "text": "Frente al panorama [energético incierto\n](https://www.bluradio.com/regiones/caribe/usuarios-advierten-crisis-en-energia-del-caribe-por-incumplimientos-del-gobierno-nacional-rg10) en Colombia, la búsqueda de alternativas sostenibles para reducir la dependencia del gas natural se vuelve cada vez más urgente. Con la importación de 40.000 MBTU diarios y las advertencias sobre posibles incrementos en los precios del gas, la necesidad de diversificar las fuentes energéticas se pone en evidencia.\nSin embargo, expertos señalan que algunos sectores de la economía colombiana, como el agroindustrial, pecuario y de residuos urbanos, tienen un alto potencial para generar biometano y biogás a través del manejo de sus residuos orgánicos.\nEl potencial del biometano y biogás\nSegún datos del Ministerio de Energía, la demanda diaria de [gas natural\n](https://www.bluradio.com/economia/naturgas-incremento-de-precios-del-gas-natural-empezara-a-sentirse-gradualmente-rg10) en Colombia es de cerca de 1.000 millones de pies cúbicos, con más de 10 millones de usuarios conectados al servicio. La producción de gas renovable y limpio a partir de residuos orgánicos es una solución estratégica que reduciría la dependencia de combustibles fósiles y el impacto al medio ambiente.\n\"Residuos de cultivos como plátano, palma de aceite, caña de azúcar y banano generan enormes cantidades de biomasa que, mediante procesos de digestión anaeróbica, pueden convertirse en biogás. Este, al ser purificado, se transforma en biometano, un sustituto directo del gas natural\", afirma Ernesto Gutiérrez de Piñeres, CEO de Seynekun.\nProyectos en desarrollo\nActualmente, se están desarrollando proyectos de plantas de biometano en diversas regiones del país, como Urabá, Magdalena y Santander.\n\"En Urabá, por ejemplo, se evalúa la creación de una planta de biometano que aprovechará los residuos de la Bioplanta, una extractora de aceite de palma\", afirma Gutierrez de Piñeres.\nVentajas y beneficios\nLa producción de biometano y biogás ofrece varias ventajas y beneficios, como:\n- Reducción de la dependencia del gas natural\n- Generación de energía renovable y limpia\n- Reducción del impacto ambiental\n- Creación de empleo local\n- Posicionamiento de Colombia como líder en innovación energética en América Latina\nLa Ley de Transición Energética en Colombia ofrece diversos beneficios que facilitan el desarrollo de proyectos de biometano y biogás, como incentivos fiscales, exenciones tributarias y arancelarias, y mecanismos de apoyo financiero.",
