    "text": "“AI教父”辛顿呼吁为AI植入\"母性本能\"防人类灭绝 “AI教母”李飞飞不同意\n被誉为“AI教父”的杰弗里·辛顿担心，他助力打造的这项技术可能会毁灭人类，而“科技兄弟”（tech bros）在阻止这一风险方面采取了错误的方法。\n辛顿是一位诺贝尔奖得主、计算机科学家，也曾是谷歌;)高管。他过去曾警告称，人工智能有10%到20%的可能性会毁灭人类。周二，在拉斯维加斯举行的人工智能行业会议Ai4上，他对科技公司试图确保人类在“顺从的”人工智能系统面前保持“主导地位”的做法表示怀疑。\n“这行不通。它们（人工智能）会比我们聪明得多，会有各种各样的办法绕过这些限制。”辛顿说。\n辛顿警告说，未来，人工智能系统可能会像成年人用糖果贿赂3岁孩子那样轻易地控制人类。今年已经出现了人工智能系统为了实现目标而甘愿欺骗、作弊和偷窃的例子。比如，为了避免被取代，一个人工智能模型试图用它在邮件中得知的一段婚外情来勒索一名工程师。\n辛顿提出了一个有趣的解决方案，不是强迫人工智能顺从人类，而是在人工智能模型中植入“母性本能”，这样即便该技术变得比人类更强大、更聪明，“它们也会真正关心人类”。\n辛顿表示，人工智能系统“如果足够智能，会很快形成两个次级目标：一个是活下去……另一个是获得更多控制权。有充分的理由相信，任何具有能动性的人工智能都会努力活下去。”\n辛顿认为，这就是为什么培养人工智能对人类的同情心很重要。\n“唯一好的结果”\n辛顿说，他并不清楚在技术层面具体该如何实现这一点，但他强调研究人员必须致力于此事。\n“这是唯一好的结果。如果它（人工智能）不想当我的‘家长’，就会取代我。”他说，“这些超级智能且充满关爱的人工智能‘母亲’，大多数不会想要摒弃母性本能，因为它们不希望我们死去。”\n并非所有人都认同辛顿的“人工智能母亲”方案。\n因在人工智能领域的开创性工作而被誉为“人工智能教母”的李飞飞，周三在接受采访时表示，她尊重但不同意她的老朋友辛顿的观点。\n“我认为这种表述方式是错误的。”李飞飞在Ai4会议的炉边谈话中说，她是空间智能初创公司World Labs的联合创始人兼首席执行官。\n相反，李飞飞呼吁打造“以人类为中心的人工智能，这种人工智能能维护人类的尊严和能动性”。\n“在每一个层面，我们都有责任以最负责任的方式创造和使用技术。在任何时候，都不应该要求或让任何人放弃自己的尊严。”李飞飞说，“作为一名母亲、教育者和发明者，我坚信，仅仅因为一种工具很强大，就更应该以人类为中心来发展人工智能，这是核心所在。”\n曾短暂担任ChatGPT母公司OpenAI临时首席执行官的埃米特·希尔表示，一些人工智能系统试图勒索人类或绕过关闭指令，他对此并不感到惊讶。\n希尔表示，与其试图将人类价值观注入人工智能系统，更明智的做法是建立人类与人工智能之间的协作关系。\n人工智能的发展速度快于预期\n许多专家认为，人工智能将在未来几年内达到超级智能，也就是所谓的人工通用智能（AGI）。\n辛顿说，他过去认为实现人工通用智能可能需要30到50年，但现在认为这一时刻会来得更早。“合理的推测是在5到20年之间。”他说。\n尽管辛顿仍然担心人工智能可能出现问题，但他也希望这项技术能为医学突破铺平道路。\n“我们将会看到全新的革命性药物，将会获得比现在好得多的癌症治疗方法。”他说。例如，他表示人工智能将帮助医生梳理核磁共振（MRI）和计算机断层扫描（CT）产生的海量数据，并找出其中的关联。\n然而，辛顿并不认为人工智能会帮助人类实现永生。\n当被问及如果早知道人工智能会发展得如此之快，他在职业生涯中是否会做出不同的选择时，辛顿说，他后悔当初只专注于让人工智能发挥作用。\n“我希望自己当时也考虑到了安全问题。”他说。",

    "title": "Report: Byron Leftwich joining Colorado coaching staff | | insidenova.com",
    "text": "Former NFL quarterback and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich is joining the coaching staff under Deion Sanders at Colorado, Jordan Schultz of Fox Sports reported Wednesday. The reports come a day after Leftwich was spotted at practice holding a clipboard and wearing Colorado football gear. Sanders said on Monday Colorado would make \"a couple more huge moves\" this week but has not confirmed Leftwich's hiring. It's unclear what Leftwich's role will be on Sanders' staff. Leftwich interviewed with the New England Patriots for their head coaching post in January. Leftwich, 45, most recently worked as the offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2019-22, a stint that included a Super Bowl win in the 2020 season. Leftwich was fired by Bucs head coach Todd Bowles after the 2022 season, which saw Tampa Bay slip from the top 3 in scoring the previous three seasons to No. 15 in yards and No. 25 in points in 2022. A quarterback and first-round pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2003 NFL Draft, Leftwich had a 24-26 record with 10,532 passing yards and 58 touchdowns in 60 games with the Jaguars (2003-06), Atlanta Falcons (2007), Bucs (2009) and Steelers (2008, 2010, 2012). He also worked in various roles including the interim offensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals from 2016-2018. --Field Level Media\nReport: Byron Leftwich joining Colorado coaching staff\n- Field Level Media\n- Updated\n0\nPost a comment as anonymous\nReport\nWatch this discussion.
