    "title": "Blair aides wanted asylum holding camp on the Isle of Mull | The Bolton News",
    "text": "Tony’s Blair’s Labour government considered setting up a holding camp on the Isle of Mull in an attempt to drive down the numbers of asylum seekers entering in the UK, according to newly released official papers.\nThe plan, put forward by one of the prime minister’s closest aides, was part of a “nuclear option” for tackling the asylum issue which would have seen illegal migrants put straight back on the plane they arrived on with little or no right of appeal.\nDrawn up just months before the US-UK invasion of Iraq, the scheme also called for the creation of a series of regional “safe havens” in countries such as Turkey and South Africa – where refugees who could not be returned to their own country could be sent.\nAlthough in the event it was not taken up, it echoes the debate still taking place more than 20 years later around Rishi Sunak’s plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.\nTony Blair expressed his frustration at the failure to get asylum numbers down (Stephen Kelly/PA) The proposals, contained in files released by the National Archives in Kew, west London, reflect Mr Blair’s frustration that “ever-tougher controls” in northern France had not had an impact on the number of asylum claims – which reached a new monthly high of 8,800 in October 2002.\n“We must search out even more radical measures,” Mr Blair scrawled in a handwritten note.\nFollowing a brainstorming session with senior officials and advisers, the prime minister’s chief of staff Jonathan Powell produced a paper entitled Asylum: The Nuclear Option, in which he questioned whether the UK needed and asylum system at all.\n“As an island, people who come here by sea have by definition already passed through a safe country. And very few of those who apply at airports are genuine refugees,” he wrote.\n“So in fact what we should be looking at is a very simple system that immediately returns people who arrive here illegally. Uttering the word ‘asylum’ should not allow people to opt out of this system and give them the right to remain here for months or years while their cases are heard.\nNo 10 chief of staff Jonathan Powell wanted to end asylum hearings (Fiona Hanson/PA) “Ideally we should not have an asylum hearing at all, simply a decision by an immigration officer to return someone followed by a one tier fast appeal against that decision if that is necessary.”\nMr Powell said that it should form part of “a big bang solution that would send a shock through the system”.\nIn particular, he pointed to the “great success” the Australians had had by housing all asylum seekers in one place, with many asking to be returned to their own country.\nHe said that officials in the office of the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, had suggested setting up a camp on the Isle of Mull in the Inner Hebrides where people could be detained until they could be removed.\n“I doubt that is going to work because of the nimby factor, but we have commissioned work to look at tagging, detention etc to help deter people and ensure we are able to return them as soon as their appeals have been heard,” Mr Powell wrote.\nElsewhere, other officials suggested claimants could be sent to the Falkland Islands, 8,000 miles away in the south Atlantic.\nMr Powell said they were also looking at establishing a series of “safe havens” in Turkey, South African and Kenya – where asylum seekers from Iraq, Zimbabwe and Somalia could be returned to.\nAttorney general Lord Goldsmith: his aides proposed a holding camp on the Isle of Mull (Max Nash/PA) The Foreign Office said it believed Turkey in particular could be persuaded to set up such a centre “quite rapidly” in return for financial assistance, while the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees would back such an approach.\nMr Powell said they should also legislate “incompatibly” with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights to allow the removal people despite the risk of persecution – even though it would be challenged by the court in Strasbourg.\n“We would like to extend this to return any illegal immigrant regardless of the risk that they might suffer human or degrading treatment,” he advised.\n“We would almost certainly lose this case when it got to Strasbourg. But we would have two to three years in the meantime when we could send a strong message into the system about our new tough stance.\n“And we would make clear that if we lost in Strasbourg we would denounce the ECHR and immediately re-ratify with a reservation on Article 3.”\nHome Office lawyers warned that the measures would fall foul of the Geneva Convention on refugees.\nAn exasperated Mr Blair scrawled “just return them”, adding: “This is precisely the point. We must not allow the ECHR to stop us dealing with it.”",

    "text": "Balance Your Hormones With This Key Nutrition Tip, Courtesy of a Hormone Health Expert\nKickstart your New Year alongside SI Swimsuit with 31 Days of Wellness! This January, SI Swimsuit will unlock exclusive offerings with SI Swimsuit models, wellness experts, fitness gurus and others, who will guide you through 31 days of rejuvenating workouts, recipes, self-care rituals and more.\nWhile many of us begin the year by examining our diet and exercise routines, perhaps one area we often overlook is hormone health. When your hormones are imbalanced—meaning you have too much or too little of any particular hormone—you may experience irregular periods, acne or thyroid disease, among other factors, according to Cleveland Clinic.\nOne way in which our hormones get out of whack is when we take dieting to an extreme, doing things like eating smaller portions, eliminating entire food groups and counting calories. According to hormone health coach Lauren Chambers, we tend to look and feel our best when we focus on eating more, not less.\nHow does nutrition impact hormone health?\n“Hormones are chemical messengers that provide signals to various organs and tissue in your body to control super important functions such as reproduction and fertility, metabolism, sleep/wake cycle, blood sugar, growth and development and so much more,” Chambers explains. “Food, on the other hand, is to our hormones what gas is to a car, driving our cells, giving us energy and the fuel our hormones need to synthesize, produce and function optimally.”\nThus, one of the best ways to support our hormone health is by consistently prioritizing a wide variety of nutrients from the foods we eat. And while there are different nutritional parameters for everyone, based on genetics, lifestyle and personal needs, Chambers says there’s one particular formula that’s sure to help support your hormone health where nutrition is concerned.\n3 food sources to support hormone health\nIncluding a high-quality source of protein, fat and fiber at every meal or snack is key for hormone balance, according to Chambers. “These macronutrients are vital building blocks of our hormones, helping them do their jobs effectively,” the So Fresh N So Green founder tells SI Swimsuit, noting that the more inclusive you are with your diet, the better.\nHere’s some further insight to that breakdown:\nProtein\nProtein sources, such as beef, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and legumes, are “an essential structural component of all hormones, which means you have to consume sufficient protein to make enough hormones,” Chambers explains.\nFat\n“Dietary fat and cholesterol sourced from foods like avocado, olives, fatty fish, nuts and seeds, etc., are considered essential ‘building materials’ that specifically help to make steroid hormones, such as estrogen, testosterone and progesterone,” she adds.\nFiber\nFiber helps to “fuel our cells and drives the engines in the body that produce hormones,” Chambers says, and can be derived from complex carbs (like fruits and veggies) and certain grains and legumes.\nExamples of hormone-balancing meals\nSo, what are some dishes that combine protein, fat and fiber for a hormone health-friendly meal? Wild-caught salmon paired with avocado and Brussels sprouts, or pasture-raised poultry with grass-fed ghee and cauliflower are two great examples. Chambers also loves a homemade smoothie that combines protein (i.e. protein powder), fat (nut butter) and fiber (frozen wild blueberries) to fit the formula while minimizing sugar.\n“Not only do these foods individually optimize hormone health, but when paired together during a meal—such as a burger with beef (protein), avocado (fat) and baked sweet potato fries (fiber)—keeps your blood sugar stable and signals your satiety hormones, helping you feel steady, satisfied and energized afterwards, essentially communicating to your hormones that they are safe and can carry on with their normal functions,” Chambers states.\nVisit the So Fresh N So Green official website for additional hormone health content, including tasty and balanced recipes to look and feel your best in 2025 and beyond.\nStay tuned to SI Swimsuit’s 31 Days of Wellness to continue to learn how to take charge in the year ahead!",

    "title": "Nativity Scene With Two Mothers Has Conservative Catholics Up in Arms",
    "text": "An obscure Catholic church in Southern Italy finds itself at the center of controversy on the weekend before Christmas after it featured a nativity scene with two mothers, Reuters reported. Nativity scenes generally depict an infant Jesus with his mother, the Virgin Mary, and her husband, Joseph. But at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in the Southern Italian hamlet of Capocastello di Mercogliano, Joseph is nowhere to be found, according to pictures posted on social media and featured in various media outlets. In his place is another woman. A petition calling for the removal of the nativity scene has been circulated online by the conservative group Pro-Vita & Famiglia (pro-life and family). It has drawn more than 23,000 signatures. However, anyone around the globe can sign the petition and its unclear how many signatories are from Italy. Father Vitaliano Della, priest of the church in the Italian province of Avellino, defended the scene in an interview with Reuters. \"I wanted to show with this scene that families are no longer just the traditional ones,\" he said. \"In our parishes we see more and more children from the new types of families that exist and are part of our society, children of separated and divorced people, gay couples, single people, young mothers.\" News of the nativity scene broke just days after Pope Francis, in a landmark decision, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples with the understanding that those blessings are not connected to the sacrament of marriage. Pro-Vita & Famiglia called the nativity scene “blasphemous” and “a colossal lie\" in a lengthy statement on its website. Joseph, the group says in the petition calling for the nativity scene’s removal, was “sacrificed at the altar of political correctness.” The group called for the bishop of Avellino, Monsignor Arturo Aiello, to order the scene’s removal.",

    "text": "Dense fog disrupts transport in North India, red alert issued\nHeavy fog continued to disrupt transportation across North India, causing delays in numerous flights and trains on Friday.\nThe\n[India Meteorological Department (IMD)]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/india-meteorological-department-imd ) forecasted that very dense fog conditions will last until Tuesday (January 2), with cold day conditions anticipated in [Delhi]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/delhi ), Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh.\nMoroever, a red alert has been issued over foggy conditions for [Punjab]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/punjab ), Haryana, and Delhi on Friday and an orange alert for Saturday. Punjab has an orange alert warning until Sunday.\nWhy does this story matter?\nAs the\n[cold wave]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/cold-wave ) continues to grip North India, most states and union territories have been blanketed by dense fog.\nThick fog across the Indo-Gangetic Plain and snowfall in hilly areas have severely affected commutes, especially as people gather to celebrate New Year holidays.\nOn Wednesday, over 100 flights at [Delhi's IGI Airport]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/indira-gandhi-international-airport ) were disrupted. Multiple road accidents were also reported in neighboring states.\nVideos and photos online showed people taking refuge in shelter homes to beat the freezing conditions.\nLow visibility impacts trains and flights\nThe thick fog has significantly affected train services, with many running 10-12 hours behind schedule. The Northern Railway stated that the impacted trains include the Rajdhani Express on the Delhi-Howrah route. Flight operations have also been disrupted, with visibility recorded at 150 meters in Delhi, slightly better compared to the last two days. The IMD has also asked people to get in touch with concerned airlines, railways, and state transport authorities for updates regarding the journey schedules.\nIMD predicts Delhi's minimum temperature to remain around 7 degrees\nIn a respite to residents, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 10.7 degrees Celsius on Friday, up from 8.4 degrees Celsius the day before.

    "title": "A VA Medical Center in Colorado Paused Heart Surgeries for 13 Months. Its Leaders Didn't Tell Higher-Ups. | Military.com",
    "text": "Heart surgeries were paused at the [Department of Veterans Affairs](https://www.military.com/benefits/veteran-benefits) medical center in Aurora, Colorado, for more than a year in 2022 and 2023 as a result of changes made by leaders who cultivated a \"culture of fear\" at the hospital, the VA Office of Inspector General has found. Two reports released Monday by the VA's top watchdog found that the facility paused cardiac surgeries from June to July 2022 and again from September 2022 to October 2023. Leadership told their regional directors of the first pause but did not inform them or the VA's Central Office in Washington, D.C., of the second, longer suspension. The VA OIG said the pauses did not directly contribute to patient harm, but the toxic work environment, explored in a separate investigation, jeopardized patient safety. Read Next: [Army Makes It Harder for Commanders to Deny Soldiers Leave for Abortions](https://www.military.com/army) \"Senior leaders failed to utilize High-Reliability Organization principles, undermined the stability and psychological safety of service leaders and staff, and created a culture of fear,\" Dr. John Daigh, the VA assistant inspector general for health care inspections, wrote in a report. According to the investigations, five adult critical nurse practitioners who worked in the hospital's surgical intensive care unit left in April 2022 as a result of changes made to their jobs by leadership. Following those departures, [the hospital paused heart surgeries for a month](https://www.vaoig.gov/reports/hotline-healthcare-inspection/extended-pause-cardiac-surgeries-and-leaders-inadequate), resuming them only after increasing physician coverage of the intensive care unit at night by bringing in the former chief of surgery, former interim intensive care unit director and another surgeon who also worked during the day to provide care. The facility was forced to pause heart surgeries again two months later after continued efforts to attract permanent personnel failed. During the second pause, the hospital's entire cardiac surgical staff left. The hospital was able to resume procedures only 13 months later after it contracted with the University of Colorado to provide surgical teams. The staffing issues and changes to the surgical intensive care unit were part of a larger problem investigated by the VA OIG [in a separate report also drafted by Daigh](https://www.vaoig.gov/reports/hotline-healthcare-inspection/leaders-va-eastern-colorado-health-care-system-aurora-created). In that investigation, the office found a workplace climate in which leaders belittled staff publicly and dismissed their concerns, leading to resignations and transfers, as well as an environment where staff was unable to express concerns over procedures or patient safety. \"The resulting moral distress has led to an exodus of skilled staff at all levels, which in turn harms veteran care,\" one employee told OIG investigators. Shortly after the investigations began, the hospital director and chief of staff were temporarily assigned elsewhere, and two other leaders resigned. Hospital Director Michael Kilmer was sent to another regional directorate, although his LinkedIn profile still lists him as director and CEO of VA Eastern Colorado Health. Dr. Shilpa Rungta, the former chief of staff, is serving as interim physician adviser to the VA assistant under secretary of health for clinical services. \"VA recognizes that a negative employee culture can have a negative impact on patient experience, and the interim leadership at VA [Eastern Colorado Health Care System] is focused on creating a psychologically safe and healthy environment for staff,\" facility leaders said in a release Monday. The Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center is one of the VA's newest, most modern facilities, opening its doors in 2018 five years behind schedule and $1 billion over budget, with a total cost of nearly $2 billion. Last month, roughly 500 surgical procedures were canceled or delayed at the facility after staff found a mysterious black residue on reusable medical equipment needed for some surgeries. The exact source of the residue, which appears to be plastic, according to news reports, has yet to be determined but is likely linked to sterilization equipment. The IG reports made several recommendations to VA leaders at both the local and headquarters level to improve the facility's workplace environment and patient services. Those included a complete review of the facility's operations, staffing, leadership and retention, and a focus on the regional office, known as a Veterans Integrated Services Network, or VISN. The VA OIG recommended standardization of the VISN directors' roles and responsibilities and an investigation into the circumstances that kept the VISN director in the dark about a 13-month pause in cardiac surgeries. The House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health held a hearing Wednesday on the VA's regional structure, focusing on its lack of standardization and ability to provide continuity of care. During the hearing, Dr. Julie Kroviak, the VA's principal deputy assistant inspector general, described the disbelief her office had when they investigated the Aurora hospital. \"When you have that type of exodus of clinical staff, when you have closure of a cardio-thoracic program ... how that noise doesn't make it to the higher level for an immediate intervention, rescue, whatever, our team was appropriately baffled by that story,\" Kroviak said. Acting Assistant Under Secretary for Health for Support Services, Veterans Health Administration, Al Montoya assured lawmakers that the VA has responded, with the under secretary of health's office sending a team to Aurora to ensure that the department was \"appropriately resourcing\" the facility. \"I personally have a staff member out there from my team this week; I'll be personally making a trip out there next month to make sure there is progress, to make sure we are holding them accountable to moving forward,\" Montoya said. Sunaina Kumar-Giebel, director of the Rocky Mountain Network, said the facility is committed to \"prioritizing a culture of safety.\" \"Allegations of unsafe patient care or misconduct are taken seriously. These investigations will help ensure veterans, employees and stakeholders have full confidence in the quality and integrity of the leaders and care delivery provided,\" Kumar-Giebel said in a statement Monday.

    "text": "En medio de la polémica generada por la decisión de Conmebol de prohibir el ingreso de banderas argentinas con las Islas Malvinas en sus eventos deportivos, la ministra de Relaciones Exteriores de Argentina, Diana Mondino, expresó su indignación y dirigió una carta abierta al organismo sudamericano, cuestionando la arbitraria medida que atenta contra la identidad y soberanía del país. Mondino utilizó su cuenta de X para exigir una rectificación inmediata y defender el derecho de los aficionados argentinos a exhibir los símbolos que representan su identidad. En su carta, Mondino expresó: “Nos sorprende la decisión arbitraria de prohibir el ingreso de banderas argentinas que incluyan las Islas Malvinas en sus eventos deportivos. Las Islas Malvinas forman parte indiscutible de nuestro territorio, y el anhelo y reclamo soberano nunca se ha, ni se va a dejar de lado. El mismo forma parte de nuestra Constitución. El deporte históricamente ha sido un espacio de unión y expresión pacífica de las identidades de sus pueblos. Esta decisión también atenta contra la libertad de expresión”. Además, la Canciller hizo un llamado a Claudio “Chiqui” Tapia, vicepresidente de la Conmebol y presidente de la Asociación del Fútbol Argentino (AFA), solicitando que se revierta esta situación. Carta abierta a la — Diana Mondino (@DianaMondino)[@CONMEBOL] Nos sorprende la decisión arbitraria de prohibir el ingreso de banderas argentinas que incluyan las Islas Malvinas en sus eventos deportivos. Las Islas Malvinas forman parte indiscutible de nuestro territorio, y el anhelo y reclamo soberano nunca…[September 26, 2024] La controversia estalló cuando, en la previa del partido de vuelta ante Colo-Colo, River fue impedido de desplegar una bandera alusiva a las Islas Malvinas en la tribuna Sívori Alta, así como otro telón en honor a sus ídolos en la San Martín Alta. Conmebol justificó la prohibición de la bandera de Malvinas alegando que se trataba de “una manifestación de violencia política”, mientras que, en el caso del segundo telón, argumentó que su tamaño no cumplía con las regulaciones, decisiones que fueron calificadas como “irrisorias” por los aficionados y el club. La disparidad en los criterios de Conmebol quedó en evidencia cuando, en la ida disputada en Chile, Colo-Colo pudo desplegar sin restricciones una bandera que decía “Este Monumental no sabe de descenso”, además de varios incidentes en otros estadios de Brasil, como los recibimientos de San Pablo y Atlético Mineiro, que incluyeron bengalas y decoraciones que en Núñez fueron estrictamente prohibidas. Mondino cerró su carta subrayando que “Las Malvinas son, fueron y serán siempre argentinas”, y reafirmó su compromiso de defender la soberanía nacional en todos los ámbitos, incluido el deportivo. La respuesta de Conmebol aún está pendiente, pero la carta de la Canciller resuena como un fuerte llamado de atención al organismo sudamericano, que deberá reconsiderar sus políticas para evitar nuevas controversias y garantizar equidad en sus decisiones.",

    "text": "El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) elevó el aviso para el área metropolitana y ahora hay alerta roja por las fuertes tormentas que comenzaron este martes y se mantiene durante el miércoles: qué pasará y cuándo dejará de llover.\n“Se esperan fenómenos meteorológicos excepcionales con potencial de provocar emergencias o desastres. Seguí instrucciones oficiales”, detalla la descripción del SMN donde describe al nuevo alerta que se informó en la página oficial.\nEl aviso rige para todo el Área Metropolitana, la mitad superior de la Provincia de Buenos Aires además del sur de Entre Ríos y Santa Fe. Según describe, el alerta es por fuertes lluvias que volverán a establecerse sobre este territorio a lo largo de la tarde noche.\nEl avance de la “Supercelda” o “tormenta supercelular” provoco la caída de granizo de gran tamaño y ráfagas de viento que superó los 100 kilómetros por hora además de inundaciones en distintas ciudades y pueblos del centro del país.\nAlerta por tormentas fuertes en el AMBA: hasta cuándo va a llover\n¿Caerá granizo?\nAlerta por tormentas fuertes en el AMBA: hasta cuándo va a llover Este evento sería provocado por el ingreso de un frente frío que chocaría con la tormenta que comenzó el lunes y se potenció el martes por la noche. Ahora la colisión de ambos provocaría que se generen nuevas complicaciones en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, el Conurbano y alrededores.\nUna característica distintiva respecto a la tormenta Supercelular refiere a su prolongado ciclo de vida en comparación con una tormenta convencional, que suele durar entre 20 y 40 minutos. Puede persistir durante varias horas, causando estragos en una extensa área.\n“Se pronostica que este frente provocará un descenso abrupto de más de 12 grados en la temperatura, superando en severidad al evento climático registrado el día anterior”, puntualizó el meteorólogo Diego Angeli en una entrevista radial con Urbana Play.\nEl especialista agregó que “las previsiones incluyen la posibilidad de ráfagas de viento que podrían superar los 100 kilómetros por hora y acumulaciones de precipitación que podrían alcanzar los 90 milímetros”, por lo que volverán a complicarse las zonas anegadas.\nSe espera que luego de esta tarde noche, luego de las 21 horas, deje de llover y se despeje el alerta meteorológica vigente. El resto de la semana no habrá precipitaciones y bajará sensiblemente la temperatura.\nConsejos del SMN: Medidas Cruciales ante condiciones meteorológicas adversas El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) emitió una serie de consejos importantes para la ciudadanía en este momento particular.\nRefugiarse en construcciones cerradas como casas, escuelas o edificios para resguardarse de las inclemencias del clima; Mantenerse alejado de artefactos eléctricos y evitar el uso de teléfonos con cable para prevenir accidentes por electricidad; Si te encontrás viajando, permanece dentro del vehículo, ya que este ofrece una protección efectiva contra las condiciones climáticas adversas; Evitar circular por calles inundadas o afectadas para prevenir riesgos innecesarios, En caso de riesgo de inundación en el domicilio, cortar el suministro eléctrico como medida de precaución.",
