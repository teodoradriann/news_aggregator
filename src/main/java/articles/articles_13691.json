Because the first episode I shot for 'Koffee With Karan' was with Saif. I clearly remember it was on his birthday August 16, 2004. It was a day after your mom threw him out of the house.\"\nSara, who was left shocked, wondered about Independence Day, and then she went on to wish 'Happy Independence to both of them'.

Nine lemons, which were spiked on the sacred spear of the temple deity, and believed to cure infertility, were auctioned off, fetching a staggering sum of Rs 2.36 lakh.During the nine-day festivities of Paguni Uthiram, the temple priests meticulously spiked a lemon each day on the deity's spear. As the festival culminated, the management auctioned these revered lemons, igniting fervent bidding wars among devotees and traders alike. People from far and wide flock to witness and participate in this unique ritual, deeply rooted in the belief that these lemons, spiked on the sacred spear of Lord Muruga, possess mystical powers to cure infertility and bring prosperity to families. The temple, situated atop a picturesque hill, is renowned for its awe-inspiring beauty and the towering presence of its main deity, standing at 5 feet tall.Among the bidders were Aruldas and Kanimozhi, a couple from Kallakurichi district longing for a child. Their unwavering faith led them to acquire the lemons worshipped on the first day of the festival for a remarkable sum of Rs. 50,500. The lemons from subsequent days also fetched significant prices, with the total auction amounting to Rs 2,36,100.Also Read: 3 Indian Names Win Big At Asia's 50 Best Restaurants AwardsBeyond the realm of personal aspirations, the auction symbolises a celebration of tradition and spirituality deeply ingrained in Tamil Nadu's cultural fabric.

(WIFR) - Members of the community gathered Thursday at the front entrance of the Winnebago County Criminal Justice Center to remember survivors of child abuse and recognize the improvements made to help victims of child abuse and neglect. This year, the Hands Around the Courthouse ceremony honored the 2024 Blue Bow Champion for Children Award recipient, Mary Bawinkel. “We decided for the first time to have a Blue Bow Champion for Children Award, because we did want to recognize outstanding individuals that have gone above and beyond to address child abuse in this community, who have really put their heart and soul into their work and committed to helping children that are in a tough situation,” UIC Merit Director Shannon Krueger said. In 2023, nearly 170,000 calls were made the Illinois Child Abuse Hotline. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services reports 217 children died by abuse and 178 children died by neglect in Illinois last year. At the end of the ceremony, participants placed blue pinwheels and ribbons to honor survivors of child abuse and neglect and increase awareness around prevention efforts.

    "text": "„Würden sonst Deutsch sprechen“: Trump gibt bizarre Erklärung für Militärparade\nEine gigantische Militärparade rollt an Trumps Geburtstag durch Washington DC. Die Feier will sich der Präsident auf keinen Fall vermiesen lassen.\nWashington, D.C. – Während Demonstranten an der Westküste gegen die Abschiebepolitik von Donald Trump protestieren, laufen an der Ostküste längst die Vorbereitungen für die Militärparade. Am Samstag (14. Juni 2025) sollen Panzer und Kriegsgerät begleitet von hunderttausenden Soldaten durch Washington DC rollen, um sowohl den 250. Geburtstag der US-Armee als auch den 79. Geburtstag des amtierenden US-Präsidenten zu feiern.\nDoch die Eskalation in Los Angeles macht Donald Trump mit Blick auf die geplanten Feierlichkeiten am Wochenende offenbar nervös. „Haben Sie eine Botschaft an die Kritiker der Feierlichkeiten?“, fragte ein Journalist den US-Präsidenten bei einem Presse-Meeting im Weißen Haus. „Wenn irgendjemand zum Demonstrieren auftaucht, dann werden wir ihm mit sehr großer Gewalt begegnen“, sagte Trump und wiederholte die Drohung sogar noch einmal. „Jeder, der demonstrieren will, wird mit sehr großer Gewalt empfangen“. Ihm seien aber keine geplanten Proteste gegen seine Militärparade bekannt.\nDonald Trump schwärmt von „Panzern“ bei der Militärparade\nDer Plan der US-Regierung für Samstag sieht eine gigantische Show der eigenen Stärke in Washington, DC vor. „Wir haben Panzer, Flugzeuge, wir haben alles mögliche“, schwärmte Donald Trump bereits im Vorfeld über die geplante Militärparade. Nach aktuellen Informationen sollen an dieser mehr als 200.000 Soldatinnen und Soldaten teilnehmen. Daneben werden Panzer, Flugzeuge und Militärgerät aller Art aus verschiedenen Epochen in Washington zu sehen sein.\nDonald Trumps Militärparade: Infos zur Geburtstagsfeier in der Übersicht\nDatum | 14. Juni 2025 |\nBeginn | 18.30 Uhr Ortszeit (0.30 Uhr in Deutschland) |\nThema | Die Kriege der USA |\nUmfang | mehr als 100 Militärfahrzeuge und bis zu 200.000 Soldaten |\nDie US-Armee will mit der Militärparade in Washington DC an alle Konflikte erinnern, die das Land seit seiner Gründung erlebte: vom Revolutionskrieg über die Weltkriege bis zum Vietnam-Krieg. Jeder Krieg wird von 60 Soldaten in historischen Kostümen repräsentiert, gefolgt von 400 Soldaten der gleichen Einheit in ihren modernen Kampfanzügen. Außerdem werden hunderte Militärfahrzeuge in Washington DC erwartet. Die Parade dürfte damit anhand der Bilder, die durch die Welt gehen werden, stark an Russlands jährliche Militärparaden erinnern.\nPanzer und Hubschrauber bei der Militärparade in Washington DC\n- M1A2/Abrams-Panzer\n- Bradley-Kampffahrzeuge\n- Black Hawk-Hubschrauber\n- Apache-Hubschrauber\n- Chinook-Hubschrauber\nDer Prunk zum Doppelgeburtstag kostet die US-Politik offenbar eine Stange Geld. Bis zu 45 Millionen US-Dollar sollen laut US-Medien die geplanten Ausgaben für die Militärparade und die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen in Washington DC betragen. Donald Trump aber hat dafür eine Begründung parat. „Zur Abwechslung werden wir unser Land mal feiern“, sagte Trump. Die USA seien das einzige Land, das seinen Sieg im Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht feiern würde. „Ich habe andere Länder angerufen. Alle feiern es. Dabei sind wir diejenigen, die den Krieg gewonnen haben. Ohne uns würden Sie alle sonst heute Deutsch sprechen. Vielleicht würden Sie auch Japanisch sprechen.“\nDonald Trump bekommt die lang ersehnte Militärparade zum Geburtstag\nDie Militärparade in Washington DC an Donald Trumps Geburtstag ist der Höhepunkt der Feier zu Ehren des US-Militärs, die bereits seit Montag (7. Juni) laufen. Der amtierende US-Präsident hatte bereits nach seinem Sieg bei der US-Wahl 2016 eine Militärparade in der Hauptstadt verlangt. Die Behörden des „District of Colombia“ hatten das aber verhindert, weil Kosten und logistischer Aufwand als zu hoch eingeschätzt wurden. Nun aber bekommt Donald Trump seine Militärparade. Das verdankt der US-Präsident wohl der Tatsache, dass seine zweite Amtszeit den 250. Geburtstag der US-Armee umschließt.\nDoch die anhaltenden Proteste gegen Trumps Abschiebepolitik in Los Angeles dürften dessen Vorfreude auf die Militärparade trüben. Laut einem Bericht der New York Times mache man sich auch innerhalb der Republikaner große Sorgen, die Bilder von Panzern und Soldaten in der US-Hauptstadt könnten im Angesicht der Unruhen in Kalifornien ein falsches Bild erzeugen. Es könne der Eindruck entstehen, die US-Armee würde den Sieg über die eigene Bevölkerung feiern. „Das unglückliche Zusammentreffen der Parade und des Einsatzes der Nationalgarde in Kalifornien wird sich verhängnisvoll anfühlen“, sagte Kori Schake, ehemaliger Verteidigungsbeamter in der Regierung von George W. Bush, gegenüber der US-Zeitung.\nMilitärparade in Washington DC: Trump hält Rede zu Ehren der US-Armee\nDas wiederum dürfte Donald Trump aber nicht abschrecken. Der amtierende US-Präsident ist ein Meister der Selbstinszenierung und wird die Militärparade am 14. Juni vor allem dafür nutzen, um sich und seinen Geburtstag zu feiern. Auch eine Rede Trumps ist geplant. Laut der Website der Veranstaltung will das Staatsoberhaupt „250 Jahre außergewöhnliche Dienste, bedeutende Errungenschaften und ein bleibendes Vermächtnis der US-Armee“ ehren.\nOffiziell sind die Feierlichkeiten und der Soldatenaufmarsch in Washington DC aber nicht für Donald Trumps Geburtstag gedacht. Geehrt wird am „nationalen Flaggentag“ dagegen nur das Militär. Vor 250 Jahren, am 14. Juni 1775, hob der Kontinentalkongress im laufenden Unabhängigkeitskrieg zehn Kompanien aus. Der spätere US-Präsident George Washington wurde zum Oberbefehlshaber der so gebildeten Kontinentalarmee ernannt.\nDamit ist die US-Armee sogar älter als die USA selbst. Die wurde nämlich erst am 4. Juli 1776 mit Unterzeichnung der Unabhängigkeitserklärung ins Leben gerufen. Noch jünger ist Donald Trump. Der feiert am 14. Juni 2025 erst seinen 79. Geburtstag und ist damit nach Joe Biden der zweitälteste amtierende Präsident in der 250 Jahre dauernden Geschichte der USA. Sollte er seine Amtszeit beenden, würde Trump seinen Vorgänger noch überholen, und mit dann 82 Jahren und sieben Monaten zum ältesten US-Staatsoberhaupt der Geschichte werden. (dil)",
