    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nEmmy Russell is pregnant with Baby No. 1!\nRussell, 25, revealed in a recent episode of the Got It From My Momma podcast that she’s expecting a baby with her partner, fellow singer-songwriter Tyler Ward , 40. The American Idol finalist and her mother, Patsy Russell , appeared together on an episode of the podcast earlier this month. It was previously recorded live on Music Row in Nashville, Tennessee.\nHost Jennifer Vickery Smith launched the podcast to feature conversations with mothers of entertainers, including about their childhoods and family lives. Vickery Smith said at the top of the episode that “Emmy Rose has some special news to share tonight.”\n“Y’all, me and Tyler are expecting a baby girl,” Emmy announced. Ward briefly joined her on stage and cradled his hands over Emmy's growing baby bump “I’m so excited. Right out of American Idol , I didn’t know. So, you know, that’s kind of been the journey. So I’m so excited. I’m so looking forward to it. …This is the first time I’m actually fully announcing that. I thought it was fitting for this.”\nThroughout the conversation, Emmy and Patsy spoke about their lives with their grandmother and mother, respectively, Loretta Lynn . The beloved country trailblazer “passed away peacefully…in her sleep” the morning of October 4, 2022 at her ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. She was 90. Emmy previously shared how Lynn empowered her to write her own music . She also honored her late grandmother with emotional tributes during her run on American Idol earlier this year.\nFind Got It From My Momma on iHeartRadio here .",

    "title": "Bianca Belair On Mental Health, Diversity And The Road To WrestleMania | Essence",
    "text": "By Okla Jones · Updated April 4, 2024\nBianca Belair knows what it takes to perform in the best way possible. As the longest reigning WWE Women’s Champion of the modern era, she continues to push her body past conventional limits, which in turn has made her one of the most successful athletes in all of sports.\nLast month, Belair was featured on the WWE 2K24 Deluxe Edition box art, making her the first woman of color to ever be highlighted on the cover of a WWE 2K game. She also stars in a reality show focused around her and her husband Montez Ford , as they navigate their life, love, and careers as professional wrestlers. With all her accomplishments and additional endeavors on her plate, it’s important that the Knoxville, Tennessee native remains focused, and maintains that unwavering dedication to training and exercise, especially with the megaevent WrestleMania on the horizon.\nCourtesy of WWE “My husband and I; we constantly workout all the time,” Belair says. “We’re always in shape, but we really start hitting it even harder on the roads for WrestleMania . So I’ve been dieting, I’ve been working out extra hard, going to the ring, working out in the ring. You really just want to bring your best self to the table because there’s going to be 70,000, 80,000 plus people in the stadium and millions of people watching on their TV screens.”\nThrough rigorous training, prioritizing mental health, and using products like C4 Ultimate Energy—which is now the official energy drink of the WWE, Belair has reached heights that only few could ever imagine.\nESSENCE: I wanted to know; how has implementing C4 Ultimate Energy in your training regimen helped you to become a better athlete?\nBianca Belair: C4 is so important to me. I’ve actually been using C4 way before I even got into WWE. I was introduced to it when I was doing CrossFit. So everyone knows being in WWE, we do not have an off season. We’re on the road constantly, not just doing matches and shows, but doing appearances. And I have a schedule that is like none other, even when I’m not champion, I have a championship schedule, so I’m constantly needing energy. And C4 is my go-to energy drink, and it’s really cool that I get to be a part of this collaboration now that C4 has become an official energy drink for WWE. But I implement it all the time, even from their Smart Energy where I use that when I sew my own gear.\nI’m up till 3 o’clock in the morning, so I use Smart Energy when I’m sewing. I use it when I’m on the road driving from city to city. I use the Ultimate a lot when I’m working out because we fly, we land, we look for a gym, you’re just taking a 6 AM flight, so I need to pick up energy for my workout. Then later on that night I have a show, so C4 for that is healthy for me. It’s zero carbs, zero sugars, no artificial flavors. It gets me through my workout. It’s really truly my go-to energy drink.\nYou spoke about your schedule and the things you do, your training regimen, everything like that. How do you stay motivated in such an unforgiving profession?\nI feel like it just has to be a part of you and you have to love what you do. If you don’t love what you do, you’re kind of just going through the motions. But I truly have a passion for wrestling, and a passion for WWE. It helps that my husband is in the business as well, so we get to share these amazing moments together. I feel like I get to bring my family along for the journey. They’re coming to WrestleMania, they’re at every single show, so I get to see the excitement in them. But also, it’s creating a legacy. I’ve done so much and I’ve created so much history and I’m having a legacy of being undefeated at WrestleMania and I can pass this legacy down for generations to generations. That’s inspiration. Representation to me is so important. I know I am where I am because of my role models.\nSo I’ve been trying to do the same thing for other people and bring them on stage with me. And I get excited about WrestleMania season because I always try to use it as an opportunity to somehow bring me to the stage and my culture to the stage. And it was important to me last year to bring the Divas of Compton, which was a dance group of 7 to 12 year olds, all Black little girls. They happen to be a dance group and I want them to see themselves in me and see themselves on that stage. So I can do things like that. I bring purpose to what I do. It’s the purpose that drives me.\nI wanted to hone in on WrestleMania a little bit. I’m pretty sure you train the same year round, but WrestleMania is just different. It’s just such a big event. What does Bianca Belair do to prepare for the huge event that is WrestleMania?\nWrestleMania is like our Super Bowl. It’s the biggest time to prepare. Everybody’s goal is to get to WrestleMania. Everybody wants to be on the show at WrestleMania. It’s where you get the best stories, the best views, the best fights, the best gear, the best entrances, the best everything. So you want to show up in your best form. So I’m always somebody who… I always like to stay prepared. I always say I stay ready so I don’t have to get ready because like I said, we don’t have an off season. You have to be ready all year long and be ready for whenever an opportunity presents itself. But when it’s WrestleMania season, you kind of just push it up a notch.\nWhat is your favorite WrestleMania moment and why?\nWell, my favorite WrestleMania moment that I’ve been a part of, of course, my main event at WrestleMania, it made history. I was one of the first Black women to ever main event WrestleMania. I won a title at that match. I also won an ESPY off of that match. It changed the whole trajectory of my career. That moment was so beautiful. Even when you watch it back, the first minute of that match, I’m in tears standing in the ring where I’m supposed to be fighting. I’m in tears. So the moment was beautiful. My favorite WrestleMania moment outside of myself would probably be KofiMania. I remember watching and he won and we were jumping up and down and screaming and clapping and laughing and felt like it was a moment where we were a part of it. And also when it was the very first women’s WrestleMania match ever with Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair and Ronda Rousey because it was just history being made.\nYou’re an athlete that’s in peak physical condition, but I wanted to talk to you about what you do to keep your mental health on point?\nMental health is everything. I think everybody focuses so much on the physical. You go in the gym and you’re training and you’re working hard and you’re sore. You feel good about yourself. But mental health is just as important. For me, my mental health is a lot of resting because I am constantly on the go. I’m constantly so focused, grinding, I’m constantly performing; where you go out there and you’re smiling and you’re meeting fans and you’re putting smiles on fans’ faces, sometimes you tend to forget about yourself and you become mentally exhausted or you give so much of yourself to the world. When you get to your home life where you have your loved ones, the ones that truly matter and that are going to be there, even when everything’s said and done, you don’t have anything for them. You don’t have anything for yourself. So I get mentally exhausted just from being physically exhausted.\nSo I have to remember to rest. I have to remember to do things that I enjoy. I think that mental health and self-care sometimes has a misconception when people think that it’s this extravagant thing where you have to go to the spa, you have to get cucumbers and put them on your eyes and get massages. Sometimes I just need to sit down and decompress, lay in my bed and do my guilty pleasure and eat in my bed and watch all my shows. But also finding hobbies that don’t really have a purpose other than just enjoyment. Sometimes people turn their hobbies into… I need to make money off of this hobby. I love to sew, but I sew a lot for wrestling gear. So I will sew something random—a dress, a shirt, I love to read. It was a time when I first got into WWE and I went a year and a half and I realized I hadn’t picked up a book. I love to read because those books take me on journeys and it eases my mind. So it’s really just resting and finding things that you enjoy.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - Live Mint) The skies above Leh were illuminated by a breathtaking aurora display on Thursday (October 10) when a severe geomagnetic storm hit Earth. The rare occurrence was captured at India's highest observatory in Hanle.\nAlso Read | Northern lights in New York this weekend? Here's how to see aurora The event was initiated by a potent coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun that arrived at Earth on Friday. The CME stemmed from an X1.8-class solar flare on October 9 and hurtled through space at speeds surpassing 1.5 million miles per hour.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has classified the geomagnetic storm as G4, signaling severe conditions that can potentially disrupt power grids and satellite operations.\nSuch storms can make auroras visible much farther south than usual, with sightings reported as far south as Alabama and Northern California in the United States.\nAlso Read | Solar Storm 2024: Satellite operators to stay on high alert Rare auroras in LadakhIn Leh, the auroras' vibrant colours created a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of the night sky .\nAlso Read | Solar storm on Mars: NASA Rover hit by radiation equivalent to 30 chest X-rays The geomagnetic storm is a result of the current period of increased solar activity, with the Sun nearing its solar maximum, which is anticipated to reach its peak in 2025.\nThis cycle has resulted in a rise in solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which cause auroras when charged particles interact with Earth's magnetic field.\nThe auroras seen in Leh were the direct consequence of these interactions, displaying dazzling reds that enthralled spectators.\nWhile the visual spectacle was breathtaking, scientists cautioned against possible disruptions due to the storm.\nHigh-frequency radio communications are already experiencing interference, and there is concern about the potential impact on satellite navigation systems. Power companies and aviation authorities have been advised to monitor conditions closely to mitigate any negative impacts.\nResidents and tourists alike were captivated by the celestial light display, while experts highlighted the significance of comprehending the effects of space weather on technology and infrastructure. This geomagnetic phenomenon demonstrates the dynamic nature of our Sun and its impact on life on Earth.\nMENAFN12102024007365015876ID1108772000",

    "text": "Redacción Deportes, 5 sep (EFE).- El Zagreb Arena fue escenario este jueves de un homenaje al legendario jugador de baloncesto croata Dražen Petrović, que habría celebrado este año su 60 cumpleaños, con un partido entre la selección de Croacia y un combinado de jugadores que acabó imponiéndose por 110-107.\nZagreb homenajeó a Drazen Petrovic, que falleció a la edad de 28 años. Para ello se reunieron en la capital croata numerosas estrellas del baloncesto croatas, europeas y mundiales del pasado y del presente que se exhibieron ante un pabellón con 16.500 espectadores en las gradas.\nAntes del partido se emitió un cortometraje sobre la carrera de Petrović y el viaje deportivo que inició en su Šibenik natal y continuó por el Cibona de Zagreb, el Real Madrid, los Portland Trail Blazers y los Nueva Jersey Nets.\nTambién se recordaron momentos de los Juegos Olímpicos de Barcelona en 1992, cuando Croacia jugó la final y perdió ante el 'Dream Team' estadounidense.\n\"A Dražen le gustaría jugar en un ambiente tan maravilloso\", dijo su hermano Aleksandar Petrović tras el vídeo. Después salieron al parqué dos estrellas croatas de la NBA, Bojan Bogdanović y Dario Šarić, así como el base esloveno Luka Dončić. \"He oído hablar mucho de Dražen, de gente que jugó con él, y es un verdadero honor estar aquí\", dijo el jugador de los Dallas Mavericks, según el diario 'Sportske Novosti'.\n\"Mi primer club se llamó Dražen Petrović. Tengo una muy buena impresión de aquellos inicios cuando crecí con historias sobre Dražen. Es un honor para mí que seamos de la misma ciudad y que diera mis primeros pasos en el baloncesto en su academia\", afirmó Šarić, jugador de la selección croata.\nEl acto central fue el partido de exhibición entre Croacia y el 'equipo Dražen', en el que participaron muchos nombres famosos de la Euroliga y muchas antiguas estrellas de este deporte los presenciaron desde la primera fila. Eran compañeros de Dražen en la selección croata y de la generación del 92.\nCroacia, dirigida por el seleccionador Josip Sesar, estuvo representada por Goran Filipović, Martin Junaković, Krešimir Radovčić, Antonio Jordano, Mateo Drežnjak, Filip Krušlin, Mario Hezonja, Dario Drežnjak, Toni Nakić, Krešimir Ljubičić, Roko Prkačin y Danko Branković. Mario Hezonja, con 37 puntos, fue el máximo anotador del choque.\nPor el 'equipo Dražen', dirigido por el legendario Željko Obradović y que se impuso por 110-107, jugaron Marcelinho Huertas, Shane Larkin, Nenad Dimitrijević, Džanan Musa, Andre Obst, Vanja Marinković, Jaka Blažič, Tornike Šengelia, Dyshawn Pierre, Walter Tavares, Mathias Lessort y Boban Marjanović.\nUno de los descansos se aderezó con una competición de tres puntos en la que ganó Hezonja al imponerse a su compañero bosnio en el Real Madrid Dzanan Musa.\nEspecialmente emotivo fue el momento en que los compañeros de Dražen de la selección croata, que ganó la medalla de plata en los Juegos de Barcelona 1992, llegaron al centro de la cancha. Allí aparecieron Aramis Naglić, Dino Rađa, Alan Gregov, Stojko Vranković, Žan Tabak, Franjo Arapović, Vladan Alanović, Toni Kukoč y Danko Cvjetičanin, y Dražen. El propio Petrović apareció virtualmente, saludó a sus ex compañeros, a todos los presentes y se retiró. EFE\ndep/sab",

    "title": "17 High-Octane Tracks That Might Just Make You Forget The Speed Limit",
    "text": "17 High-Octane Tracks That Might Just Make You Forget The Speed Limit\nWho doesn't love cruising down the road with the speakers blasting a favorite tune? Some songs are great for a smooth and relaxing drive. But others have the opposite effect, inspiring you to turn up the volume and drive faster. I do not condone driving above the speed limit. Rules of the road should be followed. But there's nothing wrong with finding a song that has us reaching that limit.\n1. “March Madness” – Future\n“March Madness” is a collision of disparate ideas plastered onto a trap beat seemingly created by aliens. When you're on the highway, throw this one on and feel yourself — and your car — go into overdrive.\n2. “Move B***h” – Ludacris\nReleased in 2001, Ludacris' “Move B***h” is pretty much the rap equivalent of an adrenaline rush — and for a list like this one, it's pretty on-topic. Here, Luda issues a stern warning for those would stand between him and his expensive vehicle. The beat is pummeling, his voice is thunderous and the whole thing feels designed to make you put the pedal to the metal.\n3. “Life Is a Highway”- Rascal Flatts\n“Life is a Highway” is the ultimate driving song. And the Rascal Flatts cover is the greatest version. The fast lyrics, catchy chorus, and uplifting vibe make this the fun delight it is. The theme song to Cars is the natural choice to make us drive as fast as Lightning McQueen.\n4. “Danger Zone”- Kenny Loggins\nThe anthem to Top Gun is the epitome of 1980s pop/rock. While it's meant to evoke the swift feeling of fighter jets, the infectious chorus, guitar riffs, and powerful vocals will have you wanting to fly down the highway.\n5. “Drive Faster”- The Vicksburgs\nThis 1960s-inspired song from the That Thing You Do soundtrack is from the fictional band The Vicksburgs. But it feels like a genuine 1960s rock tune. The lyrics evoke wanting to hop in your car after a long work week and drive away. The chorus literally says, “Drive faster.” How could you not want to pick up the speed?\n6. “Shut up and Dance With Me”- Walk The Moon\nThe beat of this love song from Walk the Moon does not let up from the first note. It definitely will make you want to get on the dance floor. But the super fast tempo and positive, creative lyrics will also get your heart pumping and engine revving.\n7. “Out of My Heart”- BBMak\nMy favorite song from the British trio is an underrated jam I love playing on road trips. It's a romantic love song with a chorus that keeps building to an incredible crescendo of guitar solos. It's a blast!\n8. “Bad Romance”- Lady Gaga\nAnother favorite from many road trips is this Lady Gaga hit. Like other songs from the pop diva, it's rich with her incredible vocals and a structure that rises to a new peak with each chorus.\n9. “Free Bird”- Lynyrd Skynyrd\nThe rock-and-roll classic is another song with a structure that builds to impressive guitar solos. Those alone will have you putting the pedal to the metal, as it were.\n10. “In The Air Tonight”- Phil Collins\nPhil Collins has a voice like no one else. And “In the Air Tonight” has such a rich quality. What makes you want to drive faster with this one are the timbre of the voice, the song's tempo, and, especially, the incredible drum solos.\n11. “Tron Legacy”- Daft Punk\nThe soundtrack to the movie Tron Legacy is a synthesizer lover's dream. In particular, the tracks “Recognizer,” “Arena,” and “End of Line” feature swift and often frantic beats. If you're on a motorcycle, this soundtrack is the perfect one to speed down the road with.\n12. “Higher Ground”- Red Hot Chili Peppers\nAnother spectacularly awesome rock song is this bombastic hit from 1989. It's the kind of song that inspires an instant increase in speed. Have a long stretch of road ahead of you? Turn this one up, rev that engine, and go!\n13. “I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)”- The Proclaimers\nAnyone that's seen How I Met Your Mother knows the value of this song as a driving staple. Even if you get sick of it, it will come back around. The uplifting and romantic lyrics make you feel good, matching the upbeat tempo.\n14. “Up Around The Bend”- Creedence Clearwater Revival\nFans of the film Remember the Titans and the series Stranger Things are familiar with the Creedence classic and the feelings it can inspire. Naturally, one such feeling is an inexplicable desire to pick up your driving speed. It's due in no small part to the fantastic beat and the rich vocals.\n15. “Feel Like a Number”- Bob Seger\nBeyond the unexpectedly profound lyrics, the Bob Seger song will cause an increase in speed. With the swift and uptempo tune, the guitar, drums, and piano instrumentation make for a heart-pumping jam.\n16. “409”- The Beach Boys\nFor a fun-filled and breezy 1960s feel, there's nothing better than Beach Boys music. “409” is one that can inspire you to pick up the driving pace with lyrics about a car itself. It's bright and fun and will make you turn up the volume and drive faster in a heartbeat.\n17. “Born To Be Wild”- Steppenwolf\nThe Steppenwolf classic and the 1969 counter-culture film Easy Rider are synonymous. But also, it's a song that can motivate anyone to go faster and break out their wild side. It's an anthem about independence that remains a classic driving song for the ages.\nSource:\nReddit.",

    "title": "Pastor Leads Protest Against 'Nasty' Christmas Event — Charisma News",
    "text": "In Bakersfield, California, a local pastor, Angelo Frazier, led a group of hundreds of protesters from various churches to voice their opposition to a touring Christmas-themed drag show, \"A Drag Queen Christmas.\" The show, which features drag queens from \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" has been running for nine consecutive years and is currently touring 38 cities.\nPastor Frazier, who leads RiverLakes Community Church, described the event as \"naughty\" and \"perversion,\" citing its \"sexual language\" and \"naughty comedy.\" He argues that the show was \"sexualizing Christmas\" and that it was inappropriate for children and families.\n\"The message of Christmas is good will and great joy for all people,\" Frazier said. \"This, what's happening here in Bakersfield, is a perversion of Christmas.\" The pastor felt it was his duty as a Christian to speak out against the event.\nDuring the protest, Frazier addressed the crowd, emphasizing that their opposition was not rooted in hate but in a desire to offer a better way. The protest included singing Christmas carols and praying outside the Fox Theater, where the show was being held.\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up to date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nLast year's tour of \"A Drag Queen Christmas\" sparked controversy when footage appeared to show small children attending performances that featured simulated sex, lewd dancing, sexually explicit stories and a man with prosthetic breasts being spanked. The event's organizers, Drag Fans, state that \"all ages are welcome unless otherwise noted on the marketing, the ticket, or the venue website in each local city.\"\nIn Florida, state regulators and the Hyatt Regency Miami reached a settlement regarding a dispute about minors attending a performance of the show at the hotel last year. The hotel agreed to pay a fine and to prohibit minors from attending any performance that \"contains, depicts, or simulates any activities\" that violate Florida's lewdness statutes.\nAs Christians, we are called to live righteous lives according to the Bible. Although God loves all people, we are encouraged to stand for what is right and to be a light in the darkness. In 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, the Word of God states:\n\"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, and you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the Spirit of our God.\"\nThe protest led by Pastor Angelo Frazier demonstrates the concerns of Christians about the sexualization of Christmas and the potential impact on children and families. As believers, we are called to love one another, but also to stand for righteousness and to live according to God's Word.\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\nJames Lasher is staff writer for Charisma Media.",

    "title": "Blueface Sparks Debate After Shading Black Single Mothers",
    "text": "Blueface is getting criticism for his statement about black women who are single mothers.\nThe Los Angeles rapper has mastered the art of staying relevant in online discussions. After getting into it with Soulja Boy and his baby mother, Chrisean Rock, before Christmas, Blueface again sparked outrage over a tweet about black women in which he included his mother, Karlissa Saffold.\n“All black women would choose to be single moms on government assistance over any man that’s been scientifically proven before Blueface don’t blame me,” he tweeted.\nBlueface also brags about buying a 4-story house for his baby mother, Jaidyn Alexis. “My Bm got a 4 story house with an elevator for Christmas what did your BD get you,” he tweeted before adding, “Bunch of single Bm’s with no Christmas gift sounds miserable should have just got a dog b**ch at least he would have watched him self.”\nWomen are now sounding off about the “Thotiana” rapper’s tweet, with a lot of them saying they would rather be a single mother on government assistance than to be his baby mother. “Ohh see this is why he was in his feelings. Any rational woman Black, white, or brown would rather be a single mother than deal with him and that thought hurt him to his core,” one woman wrote.\nBlueface also has some legal troubles on his hands following some crude comment about Soulja Boy’s baby mother.\nSoulja Boy’s baby momma is suing Blueface after he alleged that he had sex with her just before her baby shower.\nBlueface started beefing with Soulja Boy last week in which he claimed that his private part was bigger than the “Crank That” rapper and that he had slept with his baby momma as a way to one-up the rapper in an argument.\nIt seems that the baby momma, Jackilyn Martinez, is not taking to the internet to clear things as has become common with celebrities. Still, she’s taking the rapper to court for defamation of character.\nAccording to TMZ, some of the tweets Blueface made were included in her claim, which she says are all false and defamatory to her and her child.\nAmong the tweets by Blueface is one where he told Soulja Boy, “Because I f**ked your baby mama the day before your baby shower.”\nOther things he’s said include one where he’s claiming paternity of the child- “Till Soulja get a DNA test that’s my child lil bro I’m the daddy now,” and “What’s old about your baby mama s**king my d**k.”\nOne tweet said, “This his Bm right here… shouldn’t have brought up Jaidyn f**k n****a… play this at the Versus and it’s over,” while another added, “I hit yah Bm already soulja boy ash her who perform better hit for hit.”\n“Soulja kissing d*** everytime he see his child [laughing emoji] might be my kid je ain’t even get the DNA test,” another said.\nMartinez does admit that she and Blueface had protected sex in 2018, but they have never gotten together since. She also filed the lawsuit after her lawyers intervened and sent him a cease and desist letter to remove the defamatory comments. However, a defiant Blueface taunted her on Instagram, writing, “Nobody ever said your name … I don’t even know who you are.”\nShe also says in her lawsuit that she’s been receiving death threats following the letter was received. Blueface has not reacted to the lawsuit so far.",
