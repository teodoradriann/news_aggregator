Lions on June 27.\n1:51 Edmonton Elks fire coach and general manager Chris Jones after dismal start to season Trending Now Jasper wildfire: Video and pictures show destruction within townsite Jasper wildfire: Up to 50% of townsite may have been destroyed The league also fined Edmonton defensive back Loucheiz Purifoy for delivering a high hit on Ottawa receiver Bralon Addison.

    "text": "O Campeonato Paraense Série B1 nem começou, mas já tem o primeiro debate fora das quatro linhas. No final do jogo de ida das semifinal da Série B2 entre Pedreira e Fonte Nova, Ignácio Neto, treinador do Gigante da Ilha, fez um apelo a Federação Paraense de Futebol (FPF).\n1 de 1 Ignácio Neto, técnico do Pedreira — Foto: Raul Martins Ignácio Neto, técnico do Pedreira — Foto: Raul Martins\n- Aproveitar a oportunidade para pedir para a Federação reaver o regulamento. Saiu uma nota dizendo que os atletas que jogaram a primeira divisão do Paraense e a B2, não poderão jogar a Série B1 por outro time, isso fecha portas para nossos atletas regionais que precisam trabalhar e se empregar. Estou pedindo isso não só pelo Pedreira, o Fonte Nova, mas pelas equipes de colegas e pessoas que se esforçam pelo futebol paraense, de clubes que já saíram. Esses jogadores precisam de oportunidade para trabalhar até o final do ano, até que comece o Paraense principal. Deixo aqui o apelo, em nome do Pedreira, como técnico de futebol, em nome desses caras que têm família e merecem trabalhar.\nO pedido do treinador se refere ao artigo 46 do Regulamento Geral de Competições da FPF, que diz: “O atleta que já tenha atuado por 2 (dois) Clubes durante a temporada, em quaisquer das competições coordenadas pela FPF e integrantes do calendário anual, não pode atuar por um terceiro Clube, mesmo que esteja regularmente registrado” .\nEm outras palavras, jogadores que atuaram no Parazão neste início de ano e atuaram por algum clube da Série B2 do estadual, não poderão jogar por nenhuma equipe envolvida na disputa do Campeonato Paraense Série B1.\nA Federação Paraense de Futebol não se pronunciou a respeito da declaração do treinador da equipe do Pedreira até o fechamento desta matéria.\nDesistências na Série B1 e novo sorteio\nOutra questão a ser definida na disputa do Campeonato Paraense Série B1 está relacionada a desistência das equipes participantes. Nesta semana a FPF divulgou que o Sport Belém também desistiu da competição (o Parauapebas foi o primeiro) e que fará um novo sorteio dos grupos (previsto para o dia 30 de julho) previamente definidos , decisão acordada com os clubes. Confira a nota :\nNo último dia 11 de julho, no Congresso Técnico do Parazão B1, os clubes decidiram por unanimidade realizar um novo sorteio na competição caso houvesse desistência de alguma equipe até o dia 16 de julho. Com as desistências do Parauapebas Futebol Clube e do Sport Club Belém, protocoladas de maneira oficial, isso se tornou necessário. Conforme o artigo 3º, inciso 1º do REC, deliberado de maneira unânime entre os presentes naquela reunião (in loco e on-line), o Departamento de Competições (DCO) vai utilizar de suas competências para reorganizar o formato da competição, a fim de manter a lisura, transparência e equidade esportiva entre os competidores. Desse modo, um novo sorteio será realizado no dia 30 de julho, na sede da FPF, às 17h, presencialmente e on-line, para redefinir os grupos e o formato da disputa.\n*Luiz Gustavo, sob supervisão de Nicksson Melo.\nAssista mais notícias sobre o esporte paraense\n50 vídeos",

    "title": "Thanks to El Niño, 2023 Was India’s Second Warmest Year Since 1901, IMD Reveals! | Weather.com",
    "text": "If the onslaught of year-round reporting on El Niño-induced unusually high temperatures wasn't enough of a hint, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has presented its latest official recap. India sweltered in 2023, recording its second-hottest year since 1901, with February and August scorching as the warmest in 123 years, the weather organisation revealed on Monday. The report notes that the annual average temperature across the country climbed a worrying 0.65°C above the long-term average, just shy of the record 0.71°C set in 2016. Even more concerning is the trend where all five hottest years in Indian history have occurred in the last 14 years, further emphasising that there is a rapid and significant acceleration in warming and shifting weather patterns. For reference, here are five of India's warmest years on record: 2016 was the hottest at 0.71°C above average, followed by 2023 at 0.65°C, 2009 at 0.55°C, 2017 at 0.541°C, and 2010 at 0.539°C. This trend aligns with the observed temperature increase in India, which has risen at an average rate of 1.01°C per century. As many might be aware by this point, much of the past year's warming can be attributed to the onset of El Niño. This phase is characterised by the signature heating of a strip of water in the Pacific Ocean, and corresponds to higher temperatures and reduced rainfall over the Indian subcontinent. December did bring a welcome wave of rains to the southern peninsula, with rainfall 126% above normal and the highest since 2001. But the year wasn't all sunshine and showers. The north Indian Ocean churned with above-average cyclone activity, witnessing six tropical storms, including three ferocious extremely severe cyclonic storms (average wind speeds between 167-221 kmph). These included Mocha in May, Biparjoy in June, and Tej in October. Despite all this, total monsoon rainfall over the country was only 95% of the total long-period average of 1971-2020. The extreme weather wasn't confined to the coasts, either. States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim repeatedly bore the brunt of extremely heavy rains, floods, landslides, and other major woes. IMD's grim tally revealed that 1,270 people were killed by thunderstorms and lightning, 860 by floods, and 160 by heatwaves in the past year. How’s January 2024 looking? Looking ahead, the IMD expects colder mornings for much of the country this month. While central and northwestern regions have been forecast to experience below-normal daytime temperatures, most parts of Peninsular and Northeast India will witness above-normal maximum mercuries. However, a cold wave is predicted for central India in January, and dense fog will blanket parts of Northwest and East India for the next few days. Despite IMD forecasts for \"The Boy\" to persist till March 2024, monthly rainfall over the country could be higher than usual this January, amounting to a predicted 118% of the long-term average. IMD officials added that this could help rabi crops in Northwest India greatly, especially after the region's 35% shortfall in December. ** For weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).
