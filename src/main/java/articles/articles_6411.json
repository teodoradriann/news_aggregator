    "title": "South Knoxville Elementary School leads Title I schools across the district in 3rd-grade reading TCAP scores",
    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — A Knox County elementary school principal shared her tips for success after she was recognized for her school's record third-grade reading proficiency rates. Leaders said 80% of third graders at the South Knoxville Elementary School met or exceeded the English Language Arts portion of the TCAP.\nIt's a Title I school, so it gets federal funding to support students from low-income families to achieve academic success. Superintendent Jon Rysewyk said it's one of the highest performing Title I schools in TCAP reading scores across the district.\n\"One of our priorities, our four priorities, is great educators in every building. And for us, that means two things. That means a great teacher in front of every student every day and all the support staff that make that happen. But we always call out — it also means a great leader,\" said Rysewyk.\nRysewyk said the high reading scores were a result of Tanna Nicely's work as principal.\n\"Dr. Nicely has been a great example of doing that, to do the core things so that all her students no matter who they are, where they come from, are able to read at a high level,\" said Rysewyk.\nHe also said it's impressive to have a school have 80% of third-grade students meet or exceed the reading portion of TCAP.\n\"As the district, we're in the mid-40s, which again for us is the highest we've ever been with the new standards across Knox County Schools. So 80% for a single school is, is really impressive,\" said Rysewyk.\nNicely said reading is the foundation for most things and she wants all her students to have the equal opportunity to learn.\n\"It's an initiative. It's a part of what we do here at the school. Every child deserves a right to learn how to read and to read fluently,\" said Nicely.\nShe said as a first-generation college graduate, she wanted to make sure her students know that's something they can achieve too. She also said she wants other schools to know they can reach reading rates like South Knoxville Elementary School — if they put in the work.\n\"Excellence isn't by accident. It takes a lot of practice. It's not easy, but it's something that is achievable. I feel like with that kind of mindset, these kids know they can read. It's not an 'if' or 'if it happens someday' or whatever. They are reading,\" said Nicely.\nShe said not only is the school the top Title I school in Knox County for reading retention, but it's also second in the entire county.\nNicely was given a $10,000 dollar check by David Coffey, a local businessman, former legislator and public education advocate. He said the school and the principal are the \"North Star.\"\n\"I'm impressed with it. Everybody is impressed with it. I think it's an honor to be able to honor you and in particular to honor the leader of your team, and that's your principal. There's a wee bit of magic in this room that goes on that manages to get better results of your reading than anyone else in all of East Tennessee and mostly the state,\" said Coffey.",

    "text": "Kanniyakumari: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as part of his meditation exercise, performed 'Surya Arghya' during sunrise on Friday at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial. This ritual, integral to spiritual practice, involves offering salutations to the sun, symbolising the Almighty. Modi, with folded hands, offered prayers and performed the ritual with a traditional, small beaker-like vessel, pouring water into the sea as an offering (Arghya). He used prayer beads (Japa mala) during this spiritual exercise. 110588592A short video clip titled 'Sunrise, Surya Arghya, Spirituality,' posted by the BJP on its 'X' handle, captured the Prime Minister in this serene moment. The video shows Modi, dressed in a saffron shirt, shawl, and dhoti, pouring water into the sea and praying with his japa mala. The BJP also shared photographs of the Prime Minister meditating at the Dhyan Mandapam. In these images, Modi is seen surrounded by slowly burning incense sticks, enhancing the spiritual atmosphere. He is also seen walking around the mandapam with his prayer beads. 110588610 The photographs and video clips, appearing to be taken at different times, capture Modi deeply engrossed in meditation and spirituality. However, the release of these visuals prompted a reaction from Tamil Nadu Congress president K Selvaperunthagai, who, in a post on 'X', taunted Modi for the multiple angles and videographers involved in capturing his meditation. How many angles! How many videographers! Swami Vivekananda is silent, the Congress leader remarked. 110588622Kanyakumari, renowned for its stunning sunrises and sunsets, houses the Vivekananda Rock Memorial on a tiny islet near the shoreline. Prime Minister Modi began his meditation at this iconic location on the evening of May 30, with plans to complete it on the evening of June 1.",
