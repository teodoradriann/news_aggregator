    "title": "New Year’s Eve revellers urged to wrap up warm as temperatures plummet | Shropshire Star",
    "text": "The weather is expected to remain unsettled with strong winds, heavy rain and ‘close to freezing’ conditions throughout the last weekend of 2023. New Year’s Eve revellers have been urged to wrap up warm as conditions across many parts of the UK could feel close to freezing as the clock strikes midnight. The weather is expected to remain unsettled with further strong winds and heavy rain throughout the last weekend of 2023. A yellow weather warning for wind covering parts of Wales and the east of England has been issued and will come into force between 11am on Saturday and 3am on Sunday. A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services, the Met Office said. A yellow weather warning for rain has been issued covering Wales between 10am and 6pm on Saturday, which may lead to flooding and transport disruption. A yellow weather warning for rain will also come into effect at 4am on Saturday for Northern Ireland, due to be in force until 11am the same day. The fresh warnings come on the heels of a gusty few days brought on by Storm Gerrit. Hundreds of homes in Scotland reman without power as the post-storm clean up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties will be reconnected on Friday. Thousands of properties in Ceredigion were without power on Thursday after lightning struck supplies in Wales. The Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm – Storm Hank – as a “deep area of low pressure” pushes strong winds across the Republic of Ireland on Saturday. Meteorologist Alex Burkill said Saturday is going to turn “wet and windy” across the UK with a band of “intense rain” pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly “severe gales” in exposed spots. In a forecast video, Mr Burkill said northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see “significant snow”, with possibly 10 to 20cm of snow building up on the highest grounds. “There’s a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we’ve seen over some recent days,” he said. Blustery and showery conditions are set to continue into Sunday, with the heaviest and most frequent rainfall across western parts of the UK. The mercury is expected to drop on Sunday. Mr Burkill said: “As we look towards the end of the day on New Year’s Eve, and the blustery showery theme does continue, some of those showers should start to ease as we head towards midnight. “So perhaps a bit more drier weather around, some clearer skies but do watch out for those showers and you will also want to wrap up quite warm because although it hasn’t been particularly chilly recently, when you factor in those strong blustery winds, it’s going to feel close to freezing for many places. “So definitely a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight.” New Year’s Day should turn drier for many, particularly across more central southern parts of England and across Scotland with the “central slice” of the UK most likely to have showery rain. “As we look through the rest of the first week of 2024 and at the moment Tuesday looks like it’d be a largely dry day with some fine weather around before the return to something more unsettled – some heavy rain, some strong winds, and that does bring the potential for something a little bit colder and possibly wintry,” Mr Burkill said. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A “supercell thunderstorm” that moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged around 100 homes in Stalybridge, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspended or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.",

    "title": "Israel’s War on Gaza After Historic Ruling, Lawyers Vow to Keep Fighting Biden Over Complicity in Gaza Genocide Alice Speri A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Biden but implored his administration to reconsider its “unflagging support” for Israel’s war on Gaza.",
    "text": "A federal judge declared on Wednesday that Israel is plausibly engaging in genocide in Gaza and implored the Biden administration to reconsider its “unflagging support” for Israel’s attacks on Palestinians.\nThe comments came in a ruling in response to a\n lawsuit that accused President Joe Biden and senior administration officials of complicity in and failure to prevent Israel’s genocidal acts, as required by both international and U.S. law. The Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal organization, filed the lawsuit on behalf of two Palestinian human rights organizations and Palestinians in Gaza and in the United States.\nThe judge, Jeffrey S. White of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, dismissed the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds —citing legal doctrine that prevents the judiciary from interfering in matters of foreign policy. But his strong-worded statement is unprecedented, as was his unusual decision to allow more than three hours of testimony from Palestinian plaintiffs during a\npowerful hearing last week, including a doctor calling into court from a Gaza hospital hallway.\nDuring that hearing, which took place\nruled that Israel had plausibly engaged in genocide in Gaza, White described the case as the “most difficult” of his career.\n“It is every individual’s obligation to confront the current siege in Gaza, but it [is] also this Court’s obligation to remain within the metes and bounds of its jurisdictional scope,” he wrote in his\n decision to dismiss the case. “There are rare cases in which the preferred outcome is inaccessible to the Court. This is one of those cases.”\nJustice Department attorneys had asked the judge to dismiss the case on a technicality, citing the jurisdictional question, but did not challenge the suit on its merits. In court last week, government lawyers did not cross-examine witnesses, with the exception of a scholar of the Holocaust who testified that Israel’s actions in Gaza amounted to genocide.\nAt a press briefing on Thursday afternoon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller declined to comment on the lawsuit and the judge’s ruling but said that “it remains our conclusion that the allegations of genocide are unfounded.”\nBrad Parker, a senior adviser at Defense for Children International Palestine, one of the two organizational plaintiffs in the case, said that the decision was “disappointing,” but that the judge’s findings — and the fact that such a hearing could take place in a U.S. courtroom in the first place — were of “significant, historic meaning.”\n“We know that U.S. weapons are integral in the genocide.”\n“We know that U.S. weapons are integral in the genocide that we’re documenting as a Palestinian human rights organization,” Parker told The Intercept. “But similar to the historic ICJ decision and the increasing recognition that what Israel is carrying out is a genocide and the U.S. is complicit in those genocidal acts, I think the strong language from a U.S. federal court judge increasingly works to isolate Israel’s actions and also bring pressure on the Biden administration to change course.”\n“It’s clear what President Biden’s complicity is in the destruction of Palestinian life,” Parker added. “And we’re committed to doing everything that we can to end that complicity, and ultimately end the genocide.”\nNext Steps\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs responded to the ruling by stressing the judge’s “\nhistoric rebuke” of U.S. government support for Israeli crimes. They also disputed the court’s jurisdictional finding, indicating an argument for a potential appeal or request for the case to be reconsidered.\nAhmed Abofoul, a Palestinian attorney at Al Haq, the second organizational plaintiff, testified in court last week about the killing of more than 80 of his relatives since the beginning of the war. During a press conference on Thursday, he said that the dismissal on a technicality “doesn’t mean that this was not a victory.”\n“The judge acknowledged that genocide is being committed,” Abpfoul said, “and basically what he was saying is just that his hands are tied.”\nKatherine Gallagher, a senior attorney at CCR and\nlead counsel on the case, said, “The legal conclusions are there: The U.S. is clearly on notice that its actions are in violation of both international and domestic law.”\nIn his opinion, White cited an earlier\nsuit, also brought by CCR, against Caterpillar, the manufacturer that provided the bulldozer used by an Israeli soldier to kill American peace activist Rachel Corrie in Gaza in 2003. That case was also dismissed on the basis that policy decisions are exempt from judicial review, with an appeals court upholding the dismissal. CCR attorneys argued that their case against the Biden administration is different, pledging to explore all legal avenues.\n“There is a legal distinction,” Gallagher said during the event on Thursday. The Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza is more than just “rubber-stamping or approving the use of foreign military financing for a direct commercial sale,” she said. “We have the president of the United States knowing that there is an ongoing genocide and continuing to provide ‘unflagging support’ to Israel.”\nStill, Gallagher implied that the lawsuit against Caterpillar could provide a road map for future legal action. “Companies are now on notice because of the ICJ judgment and the U.S. court judgment if they weren’t before, which they should have been. Those companies also have obligations to not further the genocide by continuing to sell and supply weapons that are being used to kill Palestinians every day.”\nJoin The Conversation",

    "title": "Churchill Decides to Scrap Turf Racing in September - BloodHorse",
    "text": "Reversing plans to use its troubled turf course during its September Meet, [Churchill Downs](https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/racetracks/10/churchill-downs) now will race strictly on dirt during its upcoming season Sept. 12-29, according to Darren Rogers, the track's senior director of communications and media services. Rogers previously told BloodHorse July 17 that the track still intended to race in September on its turf, though such use seemed optimistic after the course turned brown and unsightly in early July after postmeet work on it that included scalping, aeration, and the sprigging and fertilization of Bermuda grass. The track's $10 million turf course, installed with sod in the fall of 2021, began experiencing problems after regular usage shortly after its debut for racing in the spring of 2022. The track ran only 20 turf races apiece during its September and fall meets of last year, but after winter and spring maintenance was performed, Churchill was able to race over it through its spring meet this year, though it showed wear and tear. Seventy-four turf races were run on grass during this past meet April 27-June 30. Explaining the decision to scrap turf racing in September, Rogers said July 25 that the Churchill Downs team met and \"They just wanted it to have a little more time, let it be at its maximum for the start of the fall meet\" from Oct. 27-Dec. 1. He noted that Kentucky horses have opportunities to race on grass at [Ellis Park](https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/racetracks/47/ellis-park) and at the all-turf track, [Kentucky Downs](https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/racetracks/68/kentucky-downs), immediately before the Churchill Downs September Meet and then following it when [Keeneland](https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/racetracks/1/keeneland) runs in October. The condition book for the September Meet, likely to be released next week, will not have any turf races offered. The track had planned only one grass stakes race, the $200,000, one-mile Jefferson Cup for 3-year-olds Sept. 28, which will go on hiatus this year so as to not conflict with the Sept. 21 Bourbon Flight (formerly the Bourbon Trail) for 3-year-olds at 1 3/16 miles, the track's vice president of racing and racing secretary Ben Huffman indicated. To date, Churchill has opted not to entirely seed a new course from scratch. Having a race-ready turf course is of prime importance to the Louisville, Ky., track when it stages Kentucky Derby (G1) week in late April and early May. This year, Derby week handle was a record $446.6 million, up 8% from last year's previous record of $412 million.",
