    "text": "Welcome back to Foreign Policy’s SitRep.\nToday marks the 80th anniversary of the D-Day Allied landings in Normandy, France, to liberate Europe from Nazi Germany. U.S. President Joe Biden as well as American World War II veterans, many over 100 years old, traveled to France for the commemoration events. Thanks to Brexit, though, British paratroopers who parachuted into France for the ceremonies had to get their passports checked by French customs officials near the fields where they landed.\nAlright, here’s what’s on tap for the day: North Korea lashes out at South Korea with dung-filled balloons, the U.S. approves Ukrainian strikes in Russian territory, the geopolitical fallout from Sudan’s civil war, and more.\nSouth Korea is fed up with North Korea’s garbage—literally. Last week, North Korea sent around 3,500 balloons full of manure, scrap paper, and cigarette butts over the border into South Korea, in response to South Korean activist groups sending balloons with propaganda leaflets and other contraband to their isolated neighbors to the north.\nAnd even though no one was hurt by the North Korean deliveries—and Pyongyang promised to pause the mud-slinging for now—the damage had been done. The relative calm on the Korean Peninsula was officially trashed.\nOn Tuesday, Seoul suspended a six-year-old military agreement with Pyongyang that aimed to decrease tensions between the two countries by requiring both sides to stop holding military drills or carrying out psychological warfare activities in border areas. It’s a move that has some officials and experts worried that hostility on the Korean Peninsula—already on the rise after North Korea carried out an underwater nuclear test in January—could blow through the roof.\nTit-for-tat. The scrapped 2018 deal dated back to former South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s time in office, where he sought direct rapprochement with the north in three successive meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Both sides agreed to stop blaring propaganda messages across the border at one another and to halt live-fire exercises within the 400-square-mile demilitarized zone (DMZ) along the 38th parallel that roughly splits the two countries.\nBut even before Seoul killed the deal, relations on the Korean Peninsula were already deteriorating. North Korea’s failed launch of a military spy satellite in late May prompted South Korea to conduct air drills with 20 fighter jets—including F-35s, F-16s, and F-15s—maneuvering near the no-fly zone along the DMZ. And that’s when North Korea started sending trash balloons over the border.\n“We cannot help being enraged by such intolerable saber-rattling, a blatant violation of our national sovereignty,” Kim said . He called South Korea a “gangsters’ regime.” And he punctuated his comments by firing 18 short-range ballistic missiles in a military drill.\nNow, the Americans are involved. On Wednesday, the United States sent a long-range B-1 bomber over the Korean Peninsula in joint drills with Seoul and dropped precision-guided bombs. It was the first time that had happened in seven years. It last occurred during the war of words between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim that lasted for most of 2017.\nUnwelcome distraction. For the last three years, the Biden administration has said that the U.S. will meet with North Korea anytime, anywhere, and without preconditions—a message that Pyongyang has pointedly ignored, even as Biden himself publicly repeated the pledge during Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s visit to Washington in April.\nBut the flare-up in tensions comes at a time when the United States is trying to get South Korea to focus outside of the Korean Peninsula and repair relations with Japan to deal with the threat of China’s military rise.\nHistorical animosity stemming from Japan’s World War II-era occupation of Korea, including the military sexual enslavement of thousands of Korean women, had undermined the prospect of a diplomatic thaw for most of the past eight decades. But Seoul and Tokyo had a “kumbaya” moment at a Camp David summit with Biden, Kishida, and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol in August 2023 . Earlier this week, all three countries agreed to hold joint military exercises, and Japan and South Korea agreed to re-normalize defense ties in a significant step toward overcoming those historical issues.\nNow, South Korea’s military assets—and the political bandwidth to keep an eye on China—are once again being diverted to deal with North Korea’s threats.\nBiden has nominated Julie Smith to serve as the undersecretary of state for political affairs, the State Department’s fourth-ranking job. The role has been vacant since Victoria Nuland retired in March. Smith will stay on in her current job as U.S. ambassador to NATO while she goes through the confirmation process.\nBiden has also tapped Kin Moy to be U.S. ambassador to Vietnam and James Story to be U.S. ambassador to Mozambique. Both are career foreign service officers.\nKelly Magsamen, the chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, is set to leave her job at the end of the month after three and a half years.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has appointed Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Ronny Jackson of Texas to serve on the House Intelligence Committee, putting two close Trump allies on the powerful congressional panel charged with overseeing U.S. spy agencies.\nJohnson has also tapped Republican U.S. Rep. Ben Cline of Virginia to serve on the China select committee.\nWhat should be high on your radar, if it isn’t already.\nBeyond the Russian border. The Biden administration is now allowing Kyiv to hit targets inside Russia close to the Ukraine border with U.S. arms, and Ukraine hasn’t wasted any time since it got the green light. By Wednesday, Ukraine had already struck inside Russia with U.S. weapons, congressional aides and NATO officials told us, as Russia ramps up attacks on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv near the Russian border. Other European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have given Ukraine similar approvals .\nSome officials and congressional aides we’ve spoken to (all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters) concede there’s a chance this could further escalate tensions between Russia and NATO, particularly as Russian President Vladimir Putin floats more nuclear threats. Others believe the policy is necessary for Ukraine to defend itself and are frustrated the Biden administration has taken so long to approve the measure, believing the White House is leaning too far into micromanaging how Ukraine uses U.S. weapons systems.\nWe just want to talk. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been aggressively recruiting former fighter pilots from NATO countries to train members of its air force and naval aviators, according to a bulletin issued Wednesday by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance composed of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n“The PLA wants the skills and expertise of these individuals to make its own military air operations more capable while gaining insight into Western air tactics, techniques, and procedures,” the notice said. Front companies around the world have offered potential recruits “exorbitant salaries,” Michael C. Casey, the director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said in a statement.\n“Somalia on steroids.” The U.S. special envoy for Sudan told Foreign Policy that the East African country’s ongoing civil war could devolve into a failed state, warning that it could become “Somalia on steroids,” as Robbie reported this week .\nSudan’s civil war, one of the world’s deadliest conflicts, has killed around 150,000 people by some estimates and been the scene of widespread atrocities including ethnic cleansing and potentially genocide. It has significant geopolitical implications as well: Russia is eyeing establishing a naval refueling station in Sudan on the strategically important Red Sea coast in exchange for supplying the Sudanese Armed Forces with more weapons.\nToxic workplace. U.S. military personnel responsible for maintaining America’s nuclear weapons arsenal were exposed to dangerous toxins and chemicals without proper safety equipment or support from the Air Force, according to a new investigation from Military.com. “Many believe their jobs repairing intercontinental ballistic missiles contributed to prolonged illnesses and cancer diagnoses,” the report found.\nThursday, June 6: The European Parliament elections begin .\nBiden visits France for the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is also in attendance .\nSunday, June 9: Belgium and Bulgaria both hold parliamentary elections.\nMonday, June 10: The BRICS foreign ministers begin a two-day meeting in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.\nWatch those cholesterol levels. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is in the midst of a trial on federal corruption charges. One revelation that caught our eye from the ongoing proceedings: FBI investigators testified that Menendez ate at the pricey Morton’s the Steakhouse restaurant in Washington, D.C., 250 nights of the year .\nThe post Tensions Flare Between North and South Korea appeared first on Foreign Policy .",

    "title": "Nikki Haley expands on Civil War comment after she did not cite slavery as a cause for the war",
    "text": "The questioner told Haley it was \"astonishing\" she gave an answer that did not mention slavery.\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Thursday addressed the backlash to her\n[Wednesday night comments](/nikki-haley-doesnt-cite-slavery-as-civil-war-cause-after-question-/14233575/) about what she thought was the cause of the American Civil War, during which she notably did not cite slavery as a cause, sparking criticism.\n\"Of course, the Civil War was about slavery,\" said Haley at a Thursday town hall in New Hampshire. \"We know that. That's unquestioned. Always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery.\"\nHaley continued to elaborate, telling the crowd that the war was about more than that.\n\"It was about the freedoms of every individual,\" she said. \"It was about the role of the government. For 80 years, America had the decision and the moral question of whether slavery was a good thing and whether government economically, culturally, any other reasons, had a role to play in. By the grace of God, we did the right thing and slavery is no more. But the lessons of what the bigger issue with the Civil War is that let's not forget what came out of that, which is government's role, individual liberties, freedom for every single person, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything you want to be without anyone in government getting in our way.\"\nHaley said that she believes everyone deserves to be a free individual\nHer comments were prompted by an\n[audience question](nikki-haley-doesnt-cite-slavery-as-civil-war-cause-after-question-/14233575/) about what Haley thought the war was about.\nThe Republican candidate first turned the question around on the person who posed it.\n\"What do you think the cause of the Civil War was?\" she asked, to which the questioner responded by saying, \"I'm not running for president.\"\nHaley then stated: \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are. And we will always stand by the fact that I think the government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people,\" Haley said. \"It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn't need to tell you how to live your life. They don't need to tell you what you can and can't do. They don't need to be a part of your life. They need to make sure that you have freedom.\"\nThe questioner told Haley it was \"astonishing\" she gave an answer that did not mention slavery.\n\"What do you want me to say about slavery?\" she responded before pivoting and asking for the next question.\nIn a radio interview with The Pulse of NH on Thursday, she claimed the questioner was \"definitely a Democrat plant.\"\n\"That's why I said: 'What does it mean to you?' And if you notice, he didn't answer anything,\" she said.\nCritics accused Haley of refusing to mention slavery, saying her description of the Civil War is whitewashing U.S. history.\n\"Haley's refusal to admit that the Civil War was rooted in slavery last night in Berlin is just the latest of her shameful attempts to whitewash our country's history,\" said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley. \"From defending the Confederate flag and leaders to equating Black History Month with Confederate History Month, Haley's record bowing to the extreme fringes of the MAGA base speaks volumes and is yet another reason why New Hampshire voters will reject her next year.\"\nPresident Joe Biden responded to Haley's comments on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating simply: \"It was about slavery.\"\nA senior Biden adviser expanded on the comment to ABC News.\n\"It doesn't take a PhD to understand that slavery was the central cause of the civil war, but instead of telling it like it is, the entire MAGA field from Donald Trump on down are pandering to the most extreme fringe of their base. Minimize slavery, paraphrase HITLER, punish women and doctors - quite the record heading into the general election that will be the most diverse in history,\" the adviser said.\nAs a former South Carolina governor, Haley has long been under scrutiny for her views of the Confederacy's place in American history.\nOn the campaign trail, she has repeatedly invoked the memory of her 2015 calls for the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House grounds. The call followed a racially motivated mass shooting at a Charleston church that left nine Black people dead.\n\"For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble: traditions of history, of heritage, of ancestry,\" said Haley in a speech calling for its removal. She later continued, \"At the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past.\"",

It is a situation that will occur again next week, in accordance with the strike schedule indicated by the SATTRA union.\nThe strikes will be December 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 being realized one hour stoppage in the morning and another in the afternoon. Specifically, it will be between 7:45 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. on December 2, 3, 4, and 5, dates on which it will stop in the afternoon from 7:45 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. They are also planned for December 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 between 7:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. in the morning and from 7:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in the afternoon. Additionally, this Friday, November 29, there will be a informative assembly .\nThe Avanza company has considered that this strike call is “unjustified” and “harmful”, in addition to highlighting that it is called alone by the SATTRA union, “without respecting the unity of the works committee as a representative body of the workers.”\nThrough a statement, Avanza has stated that they do not understand that “in the middle of a open negotiation on the new collective agreement and, with the push from SAMA to expedite the process, one of the five union sections that make up the committee distanced itself and unilaterally called for strikes starting in December.”\nAvanza indicates that there is a scenario of “progress in the negotiation” which is why they point out that SATTRA puts its union objectives before the interest of all the company’s workers who are affected by the agreement, in addition to harming the service and the citizen. since, in addition, they remember that the collective agreement is negotiated only with the committee as a whole and with union sections independently.\nHowever, SATTRA, which rejects the company’s offer, has indicated that The strikes are called due to no progress in the negotiation after a year and after 26 meetings with AVANZA, apart from pointing out that the strikes have the “resounding affirmative response obtained from our membership.”\nWhatsApp Twitter Linkedin Beloud\n#urban #buses #Zaragoza #continue #strike #lack #agreement #collective #agreement",

    "text": "MADRID, 26 (EUROPA PRESS)\nLa junta militar de Birmania, que accedió al poder mediante un golpe de estado en 2021, ha invitado este jueves a los grupos rebeldes a dejar las armas e iniciar conversaciones de paz de cara a la celebración de unas futuras elecciones de las que, por el momento, no se tiene fecha.\nEl Consejo de Administración del Estado ha instado en un comunicado a los grupos rebeldes de las Fuerzas de Defensa del Pueblo (PDF), con base en Mandalay, a abandonar su lucha \"terrorista\" y alcanzar una solución política al conflicto.\nLa propuesta, que no incluye a los integrantes del Gobierno de Unidad Nacional, insta a las PDF a formar un partido político para concurrir a unas elecciones que, aseguran, serán supervisadas en todo momento, si bien no detalla cuándo se llevarán a cabo.\nEsto se produce después de que la junta anunciara a principios de septiembre que tiene previsto realizar el próximo mes de octubre un censo de cara a unas ansiadas elecciones, una promesa que las autoridades birmanas han realizado en varias ocasiones, pero que no se ha materializado.\nTodo apunta a que, en caso de que se celebren los comicios, la comunidad internacional no reconozca el resultado dado que decenas de partidos han sido ilegalizados y no podrían registrarse para concurrir a las elecciones --entre ellos la Liga Nacional para la Democracia (LND) de la antigua 'líder de facto' Aung San Suu Kyii--.\nEl Gobierno de Unidad Nacional de Birmania, leal a Suu Kyi, lleva meses alertando de que estos previsibles comicios en el país carecerán de legitimidad dado que todo apunta a que no se realizarán de forma libre y justa.\nEl golpe de Estado fue perpetrado por el Ejército para anular los resultados de las elecciones generales de noviembre de 2020 en las que la LND de Aung San Suu Kyi, se hizo con la mayoría parlamentaria, argumentando que había habido fraude, una afirmación cuestionada por observadores internacionales.\nAL MENOS 14 MUERTOS y 25 HERIDOS\nLa invitación llega cuando al menos 14 personas han muerto y 25 han resultado heridas este mismo jueves como consecuencia de nuevos ataques aéreos de la junta en Thandwe, en el estado de Rajine, según ha denunciado el Ejército de Arakán, una de las milicias sublevadas.\nUno de sus portavoces, Jaing Thuja, ha asegurado que dos aviones de combate han lanzado varias bombas sobre dos campamentos de desplazados que albergaban a cerca de 200 personas, según ha recogido el portal de noticias The Irrawaddy.\n\"El régimen sabía exactamente que la gente estaba refugiando allí y bombardearon de forma intencional a civiles\", ha subrayado, agregando que la mayoría de las víctimas, sin precisar el número, son niños y personas mayores.",

    "title": "Revolutionizing Water Reuse: A Sustainable Solution for Rural Agriculture",
    "text": "In an era where water scarcity looms as an ever-present threat, a groundbreaking project in Saint Jean de Cornies, France, is setting the stage for a revolution in water reuse practices, particularly in rural areas and small wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). This initiative, born from the collaboration between Ecofilae and Montpellier Engineering, marries advanced reclamation technologies with the pressing need for sustainable irrigation solutions, aiming to redefine the approach to water reuse in agriculture within these communities.\nCharting New Waters in Water Reuse\nAt the heart of this transformative project is the combination of filtration and electro-oxidation technologies, a duo validated at the pilot level for their efficacy in meeting stringent standards for vegetable irrigation. Not only do these technologies promise to be cost-effective, but they also boast of robustness and low maintenance – a triad of benefits critical for their acceptance and implementation in rural settings. The driving force behind this initiative is the potential to significantly impact water reuse practices in rural areas, where 85% of WWTPs in France are smaller than 10,000 Population Equivalent (PE) and account for 30% of the total volume of treated water. These facilities are often strategically located near irrigated agricultural lands, presenting an untapped resource for sustainable agriculture.\nThe Science of Prediction: A Leap Towards Efficiency\nParallel to the practical advancements in water reuse technologies, the project also delves into the intricacies of developing data-driven models for forecasting effluent characteristics in WWTPs. The challenge of crafting accurate predictive models is formidable, given the hurdles posed by data quality, the presence of missing data, and the dilemma of relying on existing incomplete datasets versus the cost-intensive route of collecting new data. Through meticulous research, nine machine learning models were put to the test, revealing the Bayesian network model as the most accurate forecaster. This finding is pivotal for plant managers, providing a clearer estimate of the data collection efforts required to achieve precise forecasting, with a minimum of 250 samples identified as necessary for effective model training. The identification of key variables in forecasting effluent characteristics stands as a cornerstone for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of water treatment processes.\nFrom Pilot to Full-Scale: A Vision for the Future\nThe demonstration site in Saint Jean de Cornies is more than a testing ground; it's a beacon for the future of water reuse in agriculture, especially for small WWTPs in rural areas. By supplying irrigation water to a local farmer and communal vegetable gardens, the project not only champions environmental sustainability but also addresses the critical issue of water deficit, particularly in the Mediterranean region where it is most pronounced. The success of this initiative is poised to pave the way for Ecofilae and Montpellier Engineering to co-develop and market a turnkey packaged solution, promising a scalable and sustainable model for water reuse in agriculture across rural France and beyond.\nIn summary, the collaborative project between Ecofilae and Montpellier Engineering marks a significant milestone in the journey towards sustainable water management in rural areas. By harnessing innovative reclamation technologies and the power of data-driven predictive models, the initiative offers a promising blueprint for the future of water reuse in agriculture. As the project transitions from pilot to full-scale implementation, it holds the potential to catalyze a paradigm shift in how rural communities, and indeed the world, view and utilize treated wastewater, turning a once overlooked resource into a lifeline for sustainable agriculture.",

The nonprofit, which is dedicated to serving students and teachers in Broward County Public Schools, continues to expand its reach by advocating for talented student athletes throughout Broward County.\n“It’s our privilege to recognize these exceptional individuals who’ve created a lasting legacy within Broward County’s athletic community,” said Dr. Kevin Perry , Associate Director, Broward Education Foundation Athletics.\n2024 Broward County Sports Hall of Fame Inductees\nElliot Bonner has served as a distinguished leader in Broward County Public Schools for more than 50 years. A respected football and baseball coach, Bonner has mentored and motivated countless student athletes. A proud resident of Coral Springs since 1977, his journey is a testament to his dedication in fostering youth sports. From founding programs at Mullins Park to his long coaching career at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, he instilled values of hard work and dedication in his players, shaping not just athletes but upstanding individuals in the community. His impact goes beyond the field, influencing players like Dan Morgan, Anthony Rizzo and Jesus Luzardo, who found professional success. Yet, what Bonner treasures most is the enduring legacy his former students carry on as responsible community members, parents and even coaches.\nDarius Butler is a proud graduate of Coral Springs Charter School where he was a versatile standout on the football team, playing quarterback and safety. He also ran track and played basketball, scoring more than 1,000 points during his high school career and was named an All-County selection as well as an All-State honorable mention. Butler played football at the University of Connecticut and was selected by the New England Patriots in the second round of the NFL draft in 2009. He went on to play nine impressive seasons in the NFL and is currently a respected sports personality, regularly appearing on The Pat McAfee Show and co-hosts the Man-to-Man podcast with Antoine Bethea.\nAbbas Karimi trains six days a week at the Fort Lauderdale Aquatic Center and is representing Team USA as a member of the 2024 U.S. Paralympics Swim Team in Paris. Born in Afghanistan without arms, he has defied all odds through self-reliance and sheer will, garnering international recognition for his athletic achievements. Karimi learned to swim in the rivers of Kabul but at age 16 he fled the war-torn country on foot, walking through Iran and miraculously making it to a Turkish refugee camp. As word of his extraordinary swimming capabilities surfaced, he was fortuitously relocated to the United States. He has competed in many world swimming contests and was the first refugee to win a World Medal. A model of resilience and profound physical and mental strength, Visit Lauderdale, which welcomes visitors of all abilities to Greater Fort Lauderdale, recently tapped Karimi as its newest ambassador.\nDiana Nyad is a celebrated author, journalist, motivational speaker and long-distance swimmer, best known for her extraordinary feats of endurance swimming. 25 million people worldwide rooted for Nyad as she reached the Florida shore, at long last achieving her 35-year-old quest of becoming the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida, a distance of more than 110 miles. Speaking the words “Never Ever Give Up” to the wildly cheering crowd on a Key West beach in 2013, she demonstrated to the world the power of the human spirit. A prominent sports journalist, filing over thirty years for National Public Radio, The New York Times and others, Diana has earned her place as one of our compelling storytellers. She has been inducted into the International Women’s Sports Hall of Fame, the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame, among other Halls of Fame and awards of distinction. Her 2015 memoir, Find a Way , was made into a dramatic biographical film entitled Nyad in 2023 starring Annette Bening and Jodie Foster. Throughout her career, Nyad has been celebrated not only for her physical endurance but also for her resilience and determination in pursuing her goals.\nSteve Shapiro is longest reigning sportscaster in South Florida television news history. He was a fixture on the local sports scene for more than three decades and passionately reported on athletes from high school to the pros. A beloved personality on WSVN, he anchored the station’s multiple weekday sportscasts and hosted Sports Xtra on Sunday nights prior to retiring in late 2020.During his illustrious career he covered major sports events, including numerous Super Bowls, the World Series, the NBA Finals, the Stanley Cup Playoffs, all major college football bowl games, NCAA basketball tournaments, championship boxing, Triple Crown horse races, major golf and tennis events, the Little League World Series, NASCAR and the Olympics. In 2019, he was given the prestigious Silver Circle award by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Southeast Chapter for lifetime achievement.\nLexi Thompson hails from Coral Springs and grew up in a golf-loving family. The LPGA phenom is a born competitor who honed her skills playing against her golfing brothers, both of whom went on to pro careers themselves. Competitiveness stoked at a young age transferred into competition and into full bloom in 2007. That year, Lexi survived a USGA qualifier to earn a spot in the field at the 2007 U.S. Women’s Open. She was only 12 years, four months and one day old when she qualified, becoming the youngest-ever qualifier — beating a record previously held by Morgan Pressel. She turned pro at age 15 and won on the LPGA Tour at age 16. It was quite a start to a golf career, but a start that Thompson continues to live up to. To date, Lexi has 11 career wins on the LPGA Tour. In 2007, she was the youngest player to ever qualify for the US Women’s Open, and is a 2x Olympian competing Team USA in 2016 and 2020. Off the course, Thompson is recognized for her philanthropic efforts and dedication to growing the game of golf, especially among young women.\nHollywood Hills High School – 1973 State 4A Championship Football Team On the heels of the turbulent civil rights movement in the 60s, a diverse group of young men from all walks of life came together and made history. They attended Attucks, Olsen and McNichol middle schools prior to enrolling in Hollywood Hills High School, a relatively new school led by principal, Bill Brennan, an ex-FBI agent with high standards and a remarkable understanding of how to foster success for his students. As the team entered its freshman year, they merged geographically, culturally and religiously. These remarkable students overcame the racial divide and used sports to unite to overcome any challenges. Led by legendary Broward County football coach, Dick Saltrick, the team finished undefeated and beating Jacksonville Raines to win Broward County’s first state championship in football. What was more impressive was the average scoring differential. In the 13 games (10 regular season and three playoff games) the Spartans outscored their opponents an average of 34 to 7. The Spartans also ended Dade County’s dominance over Broward County teams by beating South Miami 48-7, a feat that hadn’t been accomplished in more than 60 years. Additionally, as a group they were 38-1 in their four years at Hollywood Hills. Their teams were undefeated in their freshman and sophomore years, with their only loss coming from Merritt Island in the playoffs of the 11-1 season in 1972. Support from the Hollywood Hills High administration, caring parents and backing from the student body, band, cheerleaders and drill teams helped make this “once in a lifetime” achievement a reality.\nThe 2024 Broward County Sports Hall of Fame class was nominated by Broward County residents and selected by members of the Broward County Sports Hall of Fame Committee. The seven 2024 inductees will be memorialized and enshrined on the Broward County Sports Hall of Fame Honor Wall at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida, alongside previous honorees.\nTickets are $125 per person and sponsorships are still available.

    "text": "In a bid to enhance agricultural productivity and promote sustainable practices, stakeholders in Bauchi State have advocated for the widespread adoption of organic fertiliser.\nThis call was made at a lecture organised by the Agriculture Stakeholders Interactive Forum in Bauchi State, which was organised to educate farmers and other stakeholders on the benefits of organic farming.\nArewa PUNCH reports that the forum, which also aimed at focusing on the production and use of organic fertilisers, quoted the Chairman of the Forum, Rafilawus Yohanna as emphasising “the importance of utilising materials readily available in the environment to produce organic fertilisers.”\nYohanna explained that “The forum provided a comprehensive overview of organic farming techniques, including compost-making and the proper application of organic fertilisers.\n“Using organic fertilisers offers a holistic approach to agriculture, addressing environmental, economic, social, and health benefits.”\nAlso speaking, the representative of Smart Agricultural Consultancy, Bala Usman, echoed similar sentiments, highlighting the numerous advantages of organic fertilisers over synthetic alternatives.\nHe also pointed out the environmental impact of synthetic fertilisers, particularly their contribution to the depletion of the ozone layer.\nThe agric consultant stressed that “Organic fertilisers do not only boost agricultural production but also protect the environment and promote human health.”\nArewa PUNCH reports further that the stakeholders called on government agencies, civil society groups, and the private sector to support the adoption of organic fertilisers and promote sustainable agricultural practices in the state.\nThe Forum noted that as the drive for sustainable agriculture gains momentum, its participants remain hopeful that organic farming will play a key role in addressing environmental challenges, boosting food production, and improving the livelihoods of farmers in Bauchi State.",
