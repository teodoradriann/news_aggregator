    "title": "Massachusetts considers trust funds for the state’s poorest newborns to help ‘shrink the racial wealth gap’",
    "text": "Massachusetts is considering trust funds, aimed at reducing the racial wealth gap, for the state’s poorest newborns that the recipients would be able to access when they turn 18.\nThe “baby bonds” would be an at-birth publicly funded trust fund program for\nMassachusetts residents, to be used for college, buying a home or starting a business. The amount given to each eligible newborn would depend on their household income, although it doesn’t give a maximum amount or specify who would qualify for the funds.\n“Children born into households with low income (which are disproportionately households of color) are prioritized through eligibility requirements set by the state or through a progressive allocation system, with those with the lowest income receiving the largest investments,” the Massachusetts state government\nsays on its website. “This is to provide the most support to children born with the least resources, and to shrink the racial wealth gap.”\nThe trust funds aim to narrow the racial wealth gap in Massachusetts, as well as increase “access to financial education, closing the race and gender wage gap, addressing racial equity, expanding\ncollege affordability, and promoting STEM education.”\nThe program could cost the state roughly $52 million annually with an estimated 8,000 infants qualifying each year in Massachusetts, The\nBoston Globe reported. In March 2022, the State Treasurer Deborah Goldberg announced at the Economic Empowerment Trust Fund board meeting that she was convening a task force to explore the creation of Baby Bonds in Massachusetts.\nGoldberg\ntold The Globe that officials have not yet identified a funding source for the program, but that it will “hopefully… be a priority” that “will receive the kind of funding it needs.”\nDemocratic state Sen. Paul R. Feeley, who introduced the bill in Massachusetts, said the trust funds would “build wealth from the bottom up,” putting poorer people “on a trajectory for real opportunity from day one,” The\nDaily Mail reported.\n“By investing at the start of a child’s life, we are providing a jump-start to individuals otherwise at a disadvantage by beginning to narrow the racial wealth gap and giving our most vulnerable residents a fighting shot at the middle class and the American Dream,” Feeley said.\nA national version of the law, the\nAmerican Opportunity Accounts Act, which has stalled in Congress, proposes giving each child a $1,000 seed deposit at birth, followed by annual deposits of up to $2,000 based on their parents’ income. Children from the lowest-income families could accrue $46,215 by the time they turn 18, while qualifying families in the highest income bracket could accrue around $1,681, according to the Daily Mail.\nIn Connecticut, which has its own infant trust fund, low-income babies are given a one-time deposit of $3,200, which is held in the bonds and accrues interest until they are 18, according to Massachusetts Baby Bonds task force\nfindings. In Washington, D.C., any child born in the district on or after October 1, 2021, to a family enrolled in Medicaid with an income of 300% of the Federal Poverty Line, is eligible to receive an initial deposit of at least $500.\nSimilarly, California approved a trust fund of up to $8,000 each for children who lost a parent or guardian to COVID-19. Baby bond proposals are also under consideration in Iowa, New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin.\nThe post\nMassachusetts considers trust funds for the state’s poorest newborns to help ‘shrink the racial wealth gap’ appeared first on Fox News.",

    "title": "Global Screenwriters Unions Pass A.I. Resolution With 5 Principles | Observer",
    "text": "A coalition of screenwriters unions passed a joint resolution today (April 11) with proposed industry standards for [the use of A.I.](https://observer.com/2023/09/hollywood-writer-strike-ai/) Members of the Federation of Screenwriters in Europe (FSE), representing 26 screenwriters organizations from 21 European countries, and the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds (IAWG), representing 12 unions in 14 countries, have teamed up to put forward five guiding principles to prevent any form of A.I. from [replacing human writers](https://observer.com/2024/03/ai-hollywood-sara-poyner-bbc-documentary/). The five principles are: - Affirm that only writers create literary material and that large language models (LLMs) or any other present or future forms of A.I. cannot be used in place of writers; - Work to create mechanisms for obligatory transparency and accountability and to ensure writers are informed if A.I.-generated material is used to write, rewrite, polish or perform any additional writing services; - Advocate for robust licensing mechanisms that require explicit and informed consent for the use of writers’ intellectual property in A.I. training data with a goal to ensure only intellectual property that has been licensed for such use be included in the datasets of commercialized LLMs, or any other present or future forms of A.I.; - Ensure that only human beings are entitled to authors rights and recognized under copyright law in the context of machine generated material; - Advocate for fair remuneration for the use of writers’ intellectual property in LLMs or any other present or future forms of A.I. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) was credited for inspiring the passage of the resolution. “The members of the IAWG seek to build on the hard-won protections our sister Guilds in America, the WGAE and the WGAW, were able to achieve during their strike: namely that it should be a tool to enhance our writing process, not diminish the value of our work or replace us,” [Jennifer Davidson](https://observer.com/person/jennifer-davidson/), an Irish screenwriter who chairs the IAWG, said in a statement. When the WGA won its contract last year following a 148-day strike, it established A.I. protections with the studios which included prohibiting A.I.-generated material from being used as source material and requiring companies to disclose to writers if they will be dealing with A.I.-generated materials. Last month, the European Union passed [the AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/), the world’s first comprehensive legislation to address the use of A.I. German screenwriter and FSE President [Carolin Otto](https://observer.com/person/carolin-otto/) said in a statement that the regulation still leaves some “unresolved issues” around using intellectual property to train large language models (LLM) and with authorship and copyright. “We intend to voice our concerns in both national and global policy arenas, as well as develop standard language film and television writers can demand in their contracts,” Otto said.",
