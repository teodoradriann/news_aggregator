    "title": "Veïns de Mandri destaquen l'esperit \\\"cívic\\\" del botellot",
    "text": "Veïns de Mandri destaquen l’esperit \"cívic\" del botellot\nRestauradors asseguren que van complir les normes acordades amb l’Ajuntament per evitar sancions en l’acte que va congregar 2.000 persones el vespre de Nadal.\nEl que va començar com una convocatòria improvisada ja s’ha convertit en una tradició. \"¡Fins i tot en un mite!\", destaca un veí del carrer Mandri de Barcelona en declaracions a EL PERIÓDICO, que enguany no es va voler perdre el macrobotellot que va congregar 2.000 persones en aquest eix del districte de Sarrià-Sant Gervasi la tarda de Nadal. Malgrat la multitud concentrada entre la ronda General Mitre i el carrer de Maó, molts dels veïns de Mandri es van despertar el matí de Sant Esteve satisfets amb l’esperit civilitzat que hi va haver. \"Doncs em sembla genial. Tant de bo fos cada nit\", explica una altra veïna a qui li hauria agradat assistir-hi. En el seu quart any, sembla que la multitudinària festa ja s’ha fet un lloc.\nTot i que no hi havia convocatòria oficial, els residents d’aquesta zona sabien des de fa dies quin era el pla de la tarda del 25 de desembre. Reunir-se al carrer Mandri, on es concentren els bars. Almenys tres dels establiments van tancar per aprofitar per descansar, però la resta estaven oberts. I molt preparats. Els restauradors van arribar a un acord amb el districte de Sarrià-Sant Gervasi per evitar les sancions de més de 4.000 euros que van ser imposades l’any passat. Tenien les normes clares: tancar les terrasses a les cinc de la tarda, no sobrepassar l’aforament del local i assegurar-se que cap dels clients sortís al carrer amb begudes.\nLa gent va començar a reunir-s’hi cap a les sis de la tarda i a les vuit ja no hi cabia una agulla. Aleshores el carrer ja estava tallat al trànsit. \"La gent aprofita per sortir després dels àpats de Nadal, venen a passar-s’ho bé, a respirar, a reunir-se\", explica el Luiggi, a punt de complir 60 anys i amb ganes d’apuntar-se un any més a la festa. Per ell, s’hauria de fer a més carrers perquè no és una manifestació, sinó \"una festa superagradable\" en què hi ha un \"comportament cívic espectacular\".\n\"A molta gent li fa ràbia que la gent jove gaudeixi. És una cosa sana, són festes, no fa mal a ningú\", afirma Serenela, que, acompanyada del Jorge, lamenten no haver-hi pogut assistir. \"Com més festa millor, sempre que hi hagi respecte i educació, evidentment\". En la mateixa línia, a l’Alex li sembla \"un autèntic èxit\" que es reunissin 2.000 persones \"amb alcohol i que no hi hagi problemes\". També li sembla bé que es faci la festa, tenint en compte que són dies en què \"la gent d’aquest barri no hi és\". \"La gent és civilitzada\", remarca. El Javier, un dels joves que s’hi va acostar, destaca que no va veure \"baralla en cap moment\" ni enfrontaments quan la Guàrdia Urbana va desallotjar la gent.\n\"Deixen el carrer fet un fàstic\"\nHi ha altres veïns a qui, més que el soroll de la gent, els va preocupar com va quedar el carrer quan el van desallotjar cap a les 00.30 hores. \"El deixen fet un fàstic\", lamenta una veïna d’uns 70 anys. El seu dormitori dona justament al carrer, des d’on veia sorpresa la multitud de persones. Elles no li van fer perdre la son, però sí que ho va fer el soroll dels camions de la neteja. \"No han de destrossar-ho tot i desgraciar-ho\".\nNotícies relacionadesA l’Abel, que viu en un altre dels blocs del carrer, sí que li va afectar el soroll de la gent. \"Hi havia molt de soroll, gent beguda, pixant... A mi particularment no m’agrada\", explica. En canvi, per a la Blanca l’inconvenient era com poder moure’s amb cotxe per la zona. \"La Guàrdia Urbana no ens deixava circular a ningú, ni als veïns. Des de les cinc de la tarda, tallat\". Tot i així, veu bé que se celebrés la festa. \"Eren nens bons\", diu.\nEls assistents van adquirir les begudes als supermercats de la zona i als bars, que oferien combinats. Aquesta vegada els restauradors estaven conscienciats amb les normes, que asseguren que les van complir tot i que això els ha fet perdre \"molta facturació\", lamenta la Marta, treballadora d’un dels bars. Per exemple, alguns van contractar porters per controlar que la gent no sortís amb la beguda. Tot i així, la majoria dels bars del carrer també destaquen el bon comportament dels clients, malgrat la multitud.",

    "text": "“This Good Friday it is illuminated by the faith that we are not alone, and the strength of the Lord pushes us to constant commitment for the good of the people.” Here is the message from Father Davide Sciocco from Guinea-Bissau, a country where the population still experiences much suffering, but where Lent and Easter are experienced with great participation and intensity Dearest friends, Easter is approaching, the most important celebration for us Christians, which unites the mystery of suffering and death with that of faith and the joy of resurrection. In this climate I reach you with some news from Guinea-Bissau, which lives in the uncertainty of the political situation, given that we are without Parliament and without any date for the elections, and therefore everything is precarious. But this Good Friday it is illuminated by the faith that we are not alone, and the strength of the Lord pushes us to constant commitment for the good of the people The first piece of good news is the return of our bishop after another three months of treatment in Italy. He is better now and in recent weeks he visited Casa Bambaran, which we have supported for years, on the occasion of the feast of Saint Joseph. THE Casa Bambaran deserves all our help, because not only welcomes 30 children with disabilities, orphans or with serious family problems, but it also has an inclusive school where children from the neighborhood study together with children with disabilities who also come from other parts of the city. It is in fact the first school in the country with this special attention and with support teachers, an absolute novelty here in Guinea-Bissau. See also Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Issues Statement Condemning Israeli Missile Attack_United Nations_International Law_Region Me too’Bor pediatric hospital offers a valuable service and continues in its relaunch phase. To this end, we will send some young doctors to Senegal to do specialization courses in paediatrics and surgery, so as to provide a quality service to the people most in need. To allow health care for children from poor families, for many years a non-profit organization in Rho (“Progetto Anna”) has supported a special fund for their care. There are many needs, and so we want to broaden the pool of benefactors for this great need: anyone who would like to support this Fund to give hope and life to the poorest sick children can contact me. Here too we try to do our part. There Lent, in particular here it is lived in a very intense way, with moments of prayer, fasting and charity towards those most in need. This year all Christians were invited to offer the equivalent of their meal to the Caritas nutritional recovery centers scattered in various parts of the country (including the one dedicated to our Federica Banfi in Contuboel). Also very participatory Lenten catecheses for young peoplewho are always very numerous and full of enthusiasm. I thank you for your closeness in friendship, prayer and solidarity which allows me to support many realities of evangelization and development. I wish you an Easter triduum of love and peace. AND happy Easter to each of you and your families.",

    "text": "10/05/2024 - 7:14\nInstabilidade chega ao estado nesta sexta e permanece durante o final de semana, principalmente no centro-leste e no nordeste gaúchos, o que inclui a região metropolitana de Porto Alegre, já muito afetada pela enchente.Em meio à maior enchente da sua história, o Rio Grande do Sul deve ser atingido por mais chuva a partir desta sexta-feira (10/05) e durante o final de semana, de acordo com o Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet). O órgão prevê que a instabilidade ocorra com mais força no centro-leste e no leste do estado, incluindo a região metropolitana de Porto Alegre.\nNessa área, fortemente atingida pela enchente, o acumulado de chuva pode chegar a 330 milímetros nos próximos três dias, o que levou o Inmet a emitir uma nota técnica para riscos geológicos, devido a possíveis deslizamentos de terra e desabamentos, e também geológicos, por meio de alagamentos e extravasamento de rios e canais.\nCom novos temporais, áreas já atingidas pela enchente podem sofrer inundações mais intensas. A região metropolitana concentra algumas das principais bacias de captação de rios que correm do interior – das regiões dos vales, por exemplo, onde ficam os rios Caí, Taquari e Sinos – e deságuam no Guaíba, em Porto Alegre e em outras cidades próximas.\nCom o sol e o tempo seco dos últimos dias, o nível desses rios seguiu caindo, mas a volta das chuvas pode fazê-los subir novamente, além da manutenção do nível elevado de água.\nOs alertas do Inmet têm diferentes níveis para diferentes regiões. O mais alto, de “perigo”, é para a metade norte do Estado, incluindo cidades como Porto Alegre, Canoas, São Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Santa Maria, Passo Fundo e Caxias do Sul.\nNas regiões desses municípios, as chuvas podem passar dos 100 milímetros por dia. A previsão também aponta ventos fortes que podem chegar a até 100 km/h. As demais áreas do estado estão em alerta de “perigo potencial”, com chuvas de até 50 milímetros por dia e ventos de até 60 km/h.\nDepois disso, está prevista a chegada do frio. Uma massa de ar frio e seco tende a causar queda nas temperaturas em todo o estado.\nVento prejudica\nAté o momento, o estado contabiliza mais de 100 mortos e mais de 130 desaparecidos devido à enchente que começou no final de abril e segue neste começo de maio. Quase 400 mil pessoas tiveram de deixar suas casas, com em torno de 70 mil delas em abrigos e 330 mil desalojadas, que estão em casas de familiares ou amigos.\nOs modelos projetados pelo Inmet também apontam alteração na direção do vento na Lagoa dos Patos, que é para onde escoa a água do Guaíba e que depois deságua no mar por meio de uma estreita passagem já no sul do estado, entre os municípios de Rio Grande e São José do Norte.\nDevido ao vento que pode dificultar o escoamento, cidades como Rio Grande e Pelotas seguem em alerta para inundações graduais, já que o excesso de água escoa em direção à região.\nO rio Uruguai e seus afluentes, localizados próximos à fronteira oeste do Rio Grande do Sul, também têm previsão de continuar subindo nos próximos dias.\nChuva e emergência também no Maranhão\nNo outro extremo do Brasil, no estado do Maranhão, pelo menos 30 municípios já decretaram situação de emergência devido às chuvas que atingem o estado desde abril, de acordo com informações confirmadas pela Defesa Civil.\nMais de mil famílias estão desabrigadas, e quase 3 mil pessoas, desalojadas. Até o momento, foi registrada uma morte.\nA Defesa Civil trabalha para retirar moradores de áreas de risco, enquanto o governo do Maranhão tem fornecido alimentação aos atingidos pelas cheias por meio da rede de restaurantes populares.\ngb/bl (ots)",

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judih Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. In a YouTube video made during a brief round of fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group last May, Ms Weinstein read a series of poems and expressed hope for better days ahead. “I truly hope that the next time I’m recording some Haiku it won’t be under duress, under rocket fire, under conditions where people are at war,” she said. “May we all be granted the right to our basic rights of home, food, shelter and peaceful days. Here’s hoping.” Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.

    "text": "Boeing's US West Coast factory workers will walk off the job after 96% voted on Thursday in favor of a strike, halting production of the planemaker's strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt.\nThe workers' first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time (0700 GMT) as Friday begins, just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January.\n Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp Roughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years.\n International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members voted 96% in favor of striking and 94.6% to reject the agreement. \"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for IAM, Boeing's largest union, before announcing the vote result.\n \"We strike at midnight,\" he said, as members in the union hall cheered and chanted: \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\" Boeing did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n More From This Section US, British leaders discuss Ukraine's push to ease weapons restrictions Rajapaksa heir running for prez even after Lankans' ousted powerful clan Pope concludes Asia trip, reiterates interfaith tolerance to heal world Boeing machinists vote to strike after rejecting 25% pay raise over 4 years Unauthorised migration into EU countries declines despite heated politics The deal included a general wage increase of 25%, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program was launched within the four years of the contract.\n Although IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40% pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\n \"We're going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. \"This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time. Workers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing's MAX, 777 and 767 jets.\n Boeing shares closed up 0.9% on Thursday before the vote results were announced but are down 36% this year on concerns over safety, production and a $60 billion debt burden.\n The duration of the walkout is not clear. A long strike would weigh not only on Boeing's financials, but on airlines that depend on the planemakers jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft. According to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion of cash flow.\n The Boeing workers' last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day. S&P Global Ratings said that an extended strike could delay the planemaker's recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody's rate Boeing one notch above junk status.\n The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAlso Read Boeing workers vote on whether to strike, shut down aircraft production Boeing's shares rise after tentative labour deal that could avert strike Global aviation market: Boeing faces a steep climb in catching up to Airbus New Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg faces big overhaul, from factories to finances Boeing restoring output, expects 787 suppliers to catch up by year end Topics : Airbus Boeing USA democracy labour market White House Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.
