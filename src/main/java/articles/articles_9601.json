    "text": "Huge Storms Sends Huge Waves to Santa Barbara Combined with High Tide, High Surf Affecting Harbor, Beaches, Parking Lots, Surfers An enormous pair of cyclones covering the entirety of the Northern Pacific are sending 40-foot waves toward the Central Coast, but after the 400 miles of travel, the waves calm to mere 20-footers, as recorded by the buoys in the Santa Barbara Channel today. Surfers at Rincon are reporting double-overhead waves, and tourists at the breakwater in the Santa Barbara Harbor were being washed down the walkway back toward Brophy’s. “The parking lot by the café was completely flooded,” said Guidance Moon, who was working at the harbor this morning and sent images she’d taken of the flooded lot. Harbor Way, the road that leads to the Fish Market and the Yacht Club, is closed through Sunday, said Mike Wiltshire, who heads the harbor for the city. The six-foot-high tide this morning, added to the six-to-10-foot swells, sent the ocean into the West Parking Lot and the business areas. The second cyclone’s effects are expected this weekend, and the harbor crews will need the time to clean away the sand and sea wrack, Wiltshire said. He added that the main parking lot remains open but that the breakwater is closed to pedestrians. “Depending on the swells in the coming days, there is the potential of closing Stearns Wharf if needed,” Wiltshire said. The two cyclones — which would be called hurricanes if they reached 74 mph — are farther south than usual, explained Dave Gomberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. They stretch from Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to the waters off the Central Coast. The waves generated by one of the huge storms took about 12 hours to reach the California coast, with the buoy in the east S.B. Channel — roughly 15 miles south of Goleta — peaking at 21 feet around noon today. “Tomorrow there’s a break in the activity, but another wave front comes on Saturday,” Gomberg said. “It looks just as strong,” he added. The cyclone causing today’s big waves can be seen to the left where the yellow lines narrow together, showing the 43 mph winds at its center, as it swirled toward the Central Coast of California on Thursday. The energy is heading north, but leaving some rain for the Santa Barbara area. | Credit: NWS Waves are pushing the ocean into the railroad tracks at Santa Claus Lane Beach in Carpinteria — rail workers were inspecting them; Amtrak service is unaffected — while up toward Vandenberg Space Force Base in Lompoc, a buoy about five miles offshore was registering 23-foot swells at 17-second intervals. All the beaches at Vandenberg Space Force Base are closed, said Jennifer Green-Lanchoney, Chief of Public Affairs, as they are expecting surf as high as 25 feet on occasion during the next three days. Various surf websites are reporting triple-overhead waves of 18 feet off Jalama, where the lower campground was being closed for flooding, County Parks’ Jeff Lindgren said. Ocean Beach near Lompoc had the same issues, he said. Coastal flood alerts are in effect through Saturday night, which include warnings of rip tides, strong ocean currents, and large waves dangerous to novice surfers and unwary beach-goers.",

    "text": "AAA talks Distracted Driving Awareness Month and tips to combat it TWIN FALLS, Idaho (KMVT/KSVT) —The month of April is Distracted Driving Awareness Month. According AAA, distracted driving kills 10 people and injures a thousand everyday. 17% of the crashes in Idaho last year were due to distracted driving. Distractions can be a cell phone, eating while driving and even grooming oneself. Texting while driving causes your eyes to leave the road for at least 5 seconds. AAA spokesperson Matthew Conde gives tips on how to not get distracted and to keep your focus on driving conditions, “Just to getting that endorphin boost seeing that like or that response to something that we’re doing, so we need to try to control some of that. If it means putting the phone in the glove compartment or having a trusted co-pilot do the navigating, the texting, those kinds of things. That might be a really good idea, and also if you’re going to be making a lot of adjustments to things like seats, and climate controls, or mirrors. Do all those things before the vehicle starts moving.” If you’re using a navigation system, put in your location before you start driving. Check if your phone has driving focus features that help with distractions when driving. Copyright 2024 KMVT. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz today refused to respond to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for an invitation from NATO to Ukraine to join the alliance. The request for the invitation is contained in the \"Plan for victory\", recently presented by Zelensky, reported France Press, quoted by BTA. \"It is important to realize that a country at war absolutely cannot become a member of NATO. Everyone knows it, there is no disagreement on this issue,\" Scholz said on Cet De Ef TV. He recalled that during the summits of the alliance in Vilnius last year and in Washington this year, the leaders outlined the prospect of Ukraine's accession, but when the allies decide this and the conditions for this are present. \"But I think beyond that there is no new need to make a decision at this time,\" he said. Last week, Zelensky requested an invitation from the alliance right now, which will be the only and true guarantee for the security of his country. He also demanded that Western countries lift restrictions on the use of weapons they provide to Ukraine to strike at Russia, as well as to deploy non-nuclear weapons of dissuasion on Ukrainian territory. None of these requests has so far met with unanimous support from the allies, notes AFP. During the interview tonight, Scholz reiterated his position that NATO should avoid becoming a party to the conflict launched by Russia against Ukraine in February 2022. He also reiterated his opposition to the delivery of German Taurus missiles. with a long range that could reach targets located far inside Russian territory - something that Ukraine has long wanted.",
