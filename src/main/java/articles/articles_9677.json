    "title": "Nikki Haley ignores slavery as a cause for the Civil War",
    "text": "Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was asked Wednesday by a New Hampshire voter about the reason for the Civil War, and she didn’t mention slavery in her response — leading the voter to say he was “astonished” by her omission.\nAsked during a town hall in Berlin, New Hampshire, what she believed had caused the war — the first shots of which were fired in her home state of South Carolina — Haley talked about the role of government, replying that it involved “the freedoms of what people could and couldn’t do.”\nShe then turned the question back to the man who had asked it, who replied that he was not the one running for president and wished instead to know her answer.\nAfter Haley went into a lengthier explanation about the role of government, individual freedom and capitalism, the questioner seemed to admonish Haley, saying, “In the year 2023, it’s astonishing to me that you answer that question without mentioning the word slavery.”\n“What do you want me to say about slavery?” Haley retorted, before abruptly moving on to the next question.\nHaley, who served six years as South Carolina’s governor, has been competing for a distant second place to Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. She has frequently said during her campaign that she would compete in the first three states before returning “to the sweet state of South Carolina, and we’ll finish it” in the Feb. 24 primary.\nHaley’s campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment on her response. The campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another of Haley’s GOP foes, recirculated video of the exchange on social media, adding the comment, “Yikes.”\nIssues surrounding the origins of the Civil War and its heritage are still much of the fabric of Haley’s home state, and she has been pressed on the war’s origins before. As she ran for governor in 2010, Haley, in an interview with a now-defunct activist group then known as The Palmetto Patriots, described the war as between two disparate sides fighting for “tradition” and “change” and said the Confederate flag was “not something that is racist.”\nDuring that same campaign, she dismissed the need for the flag to come down from the Statehouse grounds, portraying her Democratic rival’s push for its removal as a desperate political stunt\nFive years later, Haley urged lawmakers to remove the flag from its perch near a Confederate soldier monument following a mass shooting in which a white gunman killed eight Black church members who were attending Bible study. At the time, Haley said the flag had been “hijacked” by the shooter from those who saw the flag as symbolizing “sacrifice and heritage.”\nSouth Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession — the 1860 proclamation by the state government outlining its reasons for seceding from the Union — mentions slavery in its opening sentence and points to the “increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery” as a reason for the state removing itself from the Union.\nOn Wednesday night, Christale Spain — elected this year as the first Black woman to chair South Carolina’s Democratic Party — said Haley’s response was “vile, but unsurprising.”\n“The same person who refused to take down the Confederate Flag until the tragedy in Charleston, and tried to justify a Confederate History Month,” Spain said in a post on X, of Haley. “She’s just as MAGA as Trump,” Spain added, referring to Trump’s ”Make America Great Again” slogan.\nJaime Harrison, current chairman of the Democratic National Committee and South Carolina’s party chairman during part of Haley’s tenure as governor, said her response was “not stunning if you were a Black resident in SC when she was Governor.”\n“Same person who said the confederate flag was about tradition & heritage and as a minority woman she was the right person to defend keeping it on state house grounds,” Harrison posted Wednesday night on X. “Some may have forgotten but I haven’t. Time to take off the rose colored Nikki Haley glasses folks.”\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n ",

    "text": "Fight fans aren’t happy with former UFC titleholder Tony Ferguson’s latest attempt to snap his lengthy losing skid.\nAfter parting ways with the UFC earlier this year, former interim titleholder Tony Ferguson will make his professional boxing debut under the Misfits Boxing banner.\nThe 40-year-old Ferguson will look to earn his first combat sports victory in more than six years when he faces social media influencer Salt Papi at Misfits Boxing 22 on August 30th. Ferguson and Salt Papi will battle for the MFB interim middleweight title on a card headlined by former UFC stars Darren Till and Luke Rockhold .\nAs Ferguson begins this new chapter of his fighting career, fight fans aren’t happy with his decision to continue competing.\nREAD MORE: Calvin Kattar hits back at growing calls to retire following fifth consecutive loss at UFC Nashville Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images Tony Ferguson vs. Salt Papi draws harsh reviews after Misfits announcement Ferguson lost each of his final eight UFC fights, including his most-recent defeat to Michael Chiesa at UFC Abu Dhabi last August. His current skid began with a lopsided defeat to Justin Gaethje for the UFC’s interim lightweight belt at UFC 249.\nDuring his ongoing losing streak, Ferguson has taken a lot of damage, including in a front-kick knockout defeat to Michael Chandler at UFC 274. Ferguson, one of the biggest fan favorites in UFC history, is hearing from some of his most devoted fans after his return fight was announced this week.\nFans took to social media to express their displeasure in Ferguson’s latest comeback attempt.\n“That’s so sad Tony please don’t agree to that joke. You were a great!!!” one fan wrote on X .\n“WTF are we doing?” another said.\n“Misfits is really down bad huh?”\n“What a weird world we live in.”\n“Depressing”\n“Well…it’s been nice knowing Ferguson.”\n“Tony is fighting something called ‘Salt Papi’. What have we become?”\n“Former UFC star fighting a Tiktoker on Misfits holy hell Tony gotta hang it up.”\n“Tony Ferguson getting colded by Salt Papi.”\n“I don’t even wanna think about it but if Tony loses…”\n“Dude this is so bad.”\n“Tony and Luke [Rockhold] have no business being in a boxing ring.”\nFerguson hasn’t won since defeating Donald Cerrone by doctor’s stoppage at UFC 238. His current losing skid was preceded by 12 consecutive wins, including victories over former titleholders Anthony Pettis and Rafael dos Anjos .\nFerguson was linked to an MMA fight with Dillon Danis under the now-defunct Global Fighting League banner before the bout was canceled. Danis and Ferguson could still potentially square off in Misfits Boxing if Ferguson is victorious in his return.\nREAD MORE: Dustin Poirier reacts to Joe Rogan’s shock absence for UFC 318 post-fight sendoff Luke Rockhold returns against Darren Till in pro boxing debut Meanwhile, Rockhold and Till headline in an intriguing matchup at Misfits Boxing 22. Rockhold returns to combat sports after knocking out kickboxing standout Joe Schilling at Karate Combat 45 last year.\nRockhold has had mixed results since parting ways with the UFC following a loss to Paulo Costa at UFC 278. He lost to Mike Perry at Bare Knuckle FC 41 after quitting midway through the second round.\nRockhold and Till will fight for the MFB bridgerweight title.\nREAD MORE: ‘I won’t have that burden’… Dustin Poirier tells hilarious story when reflecting on things he won’t miss in retirement",
