L’Estonienne Kadri Simson, chargée de l’Énergie à Bruxelles, l’a répété devant la commission du Parlement européen sur l’industrie, la recherche et l’énergie (Itre), le 15 février. Ce rappel à l’ordre émane de l’évaluation par la Commission européenne du Plan national sur l’énergie et climat (Pnec) remis par la France, en novembre 2023. Celui-ci ne misait que sur un objectif de 33 % pour la consommation d’énergie issue de sources renouvelables en 2030, alors que la nouvelle directive européenne (RED III) table sur 42,5 % à l’échelle européenne, donc 44 % pour l’Hexagone, à même échéance. Or, la France est encore en négociation avec Bruxelles pour éviter la sanction qui lui a été appliquée face au manquement de la cible fixée en 2020.\nIls l’ont dit le 16 février 2024\n« La France doit revoir à la hausse son ambition sur les énergies renouvelables »\n(Kadri Simson - Commissaire européenne à l’Énergie)\nLe chiffre du 15 février 2024\n20 000 euros c’est ...\nLe chiffre du 13 février 2024\n4 000 c’est ...\nLe chiffre du 12 février 2024\n50 millions d'euros c’est ...\nIls l’ont dit le 09 février 2024\n« La France demande à la Commission européenne de mettre fin aux importations de denrées alimentaires traitées au thiaclopride »\n(Ministère de l’Agriculture)\nLe chiffre du 07 février 2024\n325 millions d'euros c’est ...\nLe chiffre du 06 février 2024\n8 c’est ...\nLe chiffre du 05 février 2024\n3 c’est ...\nLe chiffre du 02 février 2024\n5 ans c’est ...\nIls l’ont dit le 01 février 2024\n« Il arrive parfois que l’écologie soit l’ennemie de l’écologie »\n(Christophe Béchu - Ministre de l’Écologie et de la Cohésion des territoires)\n1\n2\n3\n140\nNewsletter\nRecevez gratuitement nos Newsletters\n>\nDernière Newsletter\n|\nModifier son abonnement",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Ottawa skiiers embracing the last warm days before cold spell Despite the sunny and mild weather, impending cold on the horizon is prompting many skiiers to make the most out of the remaining warm days of winter. Environment Canada says colder temperatures will come to the capital as soon as Thursday, with a high of minus 9 C predicted and a 60 per cent chance of snow. It was a busy day at Mount Pakenham Ski Resort, about 60 kilometres west of Ottawa, where skiers like Jennifer Elgar were taking in the sunshine on the slopes. \"We find Pakenham does a great job with the snow conditions and you wouldn't even know that there's been mild temperatures this week,\" said Elgar. \"We're really looking forward to more snow to come because they’ll be opening up more routes.\" Despite the unusually warm weather, part of Mount Pakenham has been open since early December. Even six-year-old Clare Elgar is eager for winter's arrival. \"I get to go down lots of hills,\" said Clare. Mount Pakenham has been working tirelessly to produce artificial snow daily and combating the warm temperatures, which are expected to drop in the coming weeks. \"We’re at 100 per cent manmade snow at this point. Mother Nature hasn't cooperated too much, but the conditions that we have to offer are really good,” said Andrew Burns, Mount Pakenham's director of operations. \"We've been making snow and when they get here, they're going to be pleasantly surprised.\" Environment Canada says the coldest months of the year are fast approaching, hopefully giving the Rideau Canal Skateway a chance to avoid a repeat of last season, when it was unable to open. \"The coldest months are January and February. I'm confident that you'll see some skating on the Rideau,” says David Phillips, Environment Canada's senior climatologist. “It may be a very short season, but I believe that there will be enough cold. I just can't believe that you'd be shut out two years in a row.\" Season pass holders at Pakenham say they are ready for whatever weather is ahead. Veteran skier Brad O’Neil visits the resort more than 70 times a season and says he’ll be out here even when it’s minus 30 C. \"Yeah, absolutely. Just put layers on,\" says O’Neil. Even 75-year-old Allan Meadows remains undeterred by the cold. He says any skiing is good skiing. \"For us old diehards, we're out on the hill in any condition and we don't really care as long as we're turning our skis,\" said Meadows.

It’s about‍ recognizing⁤ that mental health is just as important as physical health.”\nVermont psychiatric Survivors⁣ Faces Uncertain Future After Losing Key State Funding Montpelier, VT – For decades, Vermont Psychiatric Survivors has been a vital voice for mental health advocacy in the state. Founded in 1983, the‍ nonprofit has championed the rights‌ of individuals impacted by psychiatric diagnoses,‍ providing support and advocating ‍for their inclusion in policy decisions. However, the association’s future is now in question after losing a crucial state grant it had relied on for years.\nThe grant, awarded by the Vermont Department of Mental Health, provided funding for peer leadership, advocacy,‍ and support ‌programs. For over three decades, Vermont Psychiatric Survivors received this funding, which amounted to $607,375 for the most recent⁣ 12-month period. This funding represented the ⁤organization’s sole source of revenue, according to Zachary Hughes, vice president of ⁢the Vermont Psychiatric Survivors board.\nZachary Hughes is a board member of vermont Psychiatric Survivors. Seen in Montpelier on Monday, December 16. Photo‌ by Glenn Russell/VTDigger This ‍summer, the department of Mental Health broke with⁤ tradition and awarded‍ the grant to a different organization. The decision followed a letter sent to the department⁢ in january by 14 members of Vermont’s psychiatric survivors community. ‍The letter expressed “serious and specific concerns” about Vermont ​Psychiatric Survivors’ performance and urged the state to seek new bids for the grant.\n“We can no longer ⁢overlook (Vermont ⁣Psychiatric Survivors’) dereliction of its responsibilities and obligations under its grant or keep quiet about the wasteful allocation of state funds to VPS,” the letter stated.\nHughes acknowledged the organization’s‍ current challenges, stating that Vermont Psychiatric Survivors has “kind of halted physical operations” and is now operating solely with volunteers, including the executive director.\nDespite the setback, the board remains committed to continuing the organization’s mission. “We’re restructuring,” Hughes said. “And we’re trying to apply for other grants.”\nThe future of Vermont Psychiatric Survivors hangs in the balance as the organization navigates this period of transition.⁣ The loss of the state grant​ has ⁢forced a reevaluation ‍of its⁣ operations and fundraising strategies. Whether the organization can successfully adapt and continue its vital work remains‍ to be seen.\nVermont Hospitals Struggle to Meet Mental Health Needs, Reports Reveal Statewide investigations expose systemic issues in ‌mental health care, leaving‌ patients vulnerable.\nVermont ‌hospitals are facing a critical shortage of ‌mental health resources, according to a series of recent state reports. The investigations reveal widespread ⁣failures in providing timely and adequate care,leaving vulnerable patients struggling to access essential services.\nThe reports, compiled ⁣by the Vermont ‌Department of‍ Mental Health, paint a stark picture of a system under immense strain. Long wait times for inpatient​ beds, a lack of ⁣qualified staff, and⁢ insufficient ⁢community-based support are just some of the challenges highlighted.\n“The system is simply overwhelmed,” said Dr. Seleem Choudhury, a psychiatrist at Northeastern Vermont ⁢Regional Hospital. “We’re seeing ‍patients in crisis who need immediate help, but we⁢ frequently enough don’t have the resources to provide it.”\nThe reports detail numerous instances where patients have been forced to wait days, ‍even weeks, for admission to psychiatric units. In some cases, individuals experiencing acute mental health crises have ​been held in emergency rooms for extended‌ periods, exacerbating their distress.\n“It’s heartbreaking ‌to see patients suffering because they can’t get the care they need,” ⁢said Anne Donahue,a nurse at Copley Hospital. “We’re doing our best,but the system is failing them.”\nThe reports​ also ⁣highlight a critical shortage of mental health⁣ professionals​ across the state. ⁢Many hospitals are struggling to recruit and⁤ retain psychiatrists, psychologists, and other specialists, ​leading to increased workloads and burnout among existing staff.\nThe Vermont‌ Association of Hospitals and Health Systems acknowledges the severity of the situation. “we’re working closely with the state to address these​ challenges,” said a spokesperson. “This⁢ is a complex issue that requires a multi-pronged⁤ approach, including increased funding,⁤ workforce progress, and‍ expanded community-based services.”\nThe reports serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for complete reform‌ in Vermont’s mental health system. advocates are calling ‍for increased investment in mental health services, improved access to care, and a greater focus on prevention and early ⁢intervention.”we need to do better for our citizens who are struggling with mental illness,” said a spokesperson for the Vermont Psychiatric Survivors. “These reports are a call to action. We ⁢need to prioritize mental health and ensure that ‌everyone has access to the care they deserve.”\nVermont Mental Health Nonprofit Faces Scrutiny‌ Over Grant Performance Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital, VT – A Vermont nonprofit dedicated⁣ to supporting individuals with psychiatric diagnoses is facing criticism over its​ performance under a state grant.\nVermont Psychiatric Survivors (VPS), which received a grant from the ⁤Vermont Department of mental Health, has been‌ accused of failing to fulfill⁣ key responsibilities outlined⁢ in the agreement. A January letter ​signed by several individuals involved in the ⁣state’s mental health ‍community raised concerns‍ about the organization’s activities.\nThe letter, obtained by VTDigger,​ alleges that VPS ​has not actively participated in statewide ​discussions about⁢ peer support, failed to appoint representatives to state‍ boards and committees, and has been absent from legislative hearings on issues affecting the psychiatric community.\nFurther criticism centers​ on VPS’s publication, Counterpoint , which the letter claims no longer prioritizes‍ the​ voices and ⁤narratives of psychiatric survivors. Delays in awarding funds for community projects also drew scrutiny.\n“We also have serious ⁢and specific concerns about VPS’s fiscal management, hiring practices, organizational culture, and adherence to its by-laws, especially regarding membership and member meetings,” the‍ letter states.\nWhile several signatories declined to comment, VPS‌ board vice president, [Name withheld], expressed disappointment over the letter’s contents, stating that some allegations were inaccurate. He acknowledged‍ that VPS had representatives on certain state boards and committees, contradicting the letter’s claims.\n“There are other things (in the letter) that we‌ certainly⁤ would have ⁣wanted⁢ to look into a little more,” Hughes said. “I certainly know that there ⁢have been concerns over the years with VPS. But we’ve always gotten through them.”\nThe Vermont Department of Mental Health has⁤ not publicly⁤ commented on the situation.\nThis controversy highlights the challenges faced‍ by⁢ organizations working in the mental health field and the​ importance of ‌transparency and accountability in grant-funded programs.\nVermont Advocate Pushes for Mental Health Parity in ‍Insurance Coverage Montpelier, VT – ⁣Zachary Hughes, a board member of Vermont Psychiatric Survivors, ⁤is on ⁢a mission. He’s fighting for what‌ he⁤ calls “true ‌parity” in mental health insurance coverage, ensuring that Vermonters struggling with mental illness have the same access⁣ to care as those with physical ailments.\nHughes, who has lived experience‌ with mental⁣ illness, believes the current ⁢system falls short. “We’re seeing people denied coverage for essential treatments, facing exorbitant ‌out-of-pocket costs, and struggling ‍to find providers who accept their insurance,” he says.\nVermont Mental Health Group ⁤Loses Grant,Citing Bias Montpelier,VT – A vermont mental health advocacy⁣ group,Vermont Psychiatric Survivors,is​ raising concerns about a recent grant decision by the Vermont Department of Mental Health (DMH).⁤ The group alleges bias influenced the awarding of a peer support grant to a newer organization, MadFreedom Advocates.\nZachary Hughes, a board member of Vermont Psychiatric Survivors, penned a letter to DMH Commissioner Emily Hawes, signed by numerous members, expressing their concerns. The letter highlighted concerns about the selection process and questioned whether​ the department adequately considered the group’s long-standing experience in providing peer support services.\n“We believe our ⁣organization has a proven track record of effectively serving the needs of Vermonters with lived experience in the mental health system,” Hughes stated. “We were deeply disappointed by the decision and believe it reflects a lack of understanding of the unique value we bring to the table.”\nThe DMH acknowledged receipt of the letter and emphasized its commitment to taking concerns seriously.‍ Spokesperson Natalie Frantz stated, “DMH recognizes the time, energy and courage it takes for individuals⁢ to share concerns, and we take those concerns very seriously.”\nThe grant in question, focused on expanding peer support services, drew applications from three organizations: Vermont Psychiatric Survivors, the National alliance on ⁤Mental Illness⁤ of Vermont, and MadFreedom Advocates.\nInternal documents obtained by VTDigger reveal that state staffers ranked MadFreedom Advocates’ proposal ‍highest. One evaluator,eva Dayon,expressed concerns about Vermont Psychiatric Survivors’ capacity to fulfill the grant’s requirements.\nMadFreedom Advocates, a grassroots organization run by and for individuals with lived experience in the mental health system, declined to comment on the situation.\nWhile the DMH maintains⁣ that the grant decision was solely based on the proposals’ content and the bidders’ ability to ‌meet the grant’s scope, Hughes believes⁤ the letter played a role.”This ⁤has ​definitely ⁢been a learning experience,” Hughes said. “But we’re still going to be here, continuing to advocate for‌ the⁣ needs of Vermonters with mental health ‍challenges.”\nThe situation highlights the complexities of grant funding and the importance ‌of transparency in ‍the decision-making ‍process. It also underscores the ongoing need for robust support systems for individuals navigating ​the mental health system.\nVermont Psychiatric Survivors Face Uncertain Future After Grant Loss Montpelier, VT – The future of Vermont Psychiatric Survivors (VPS), a vital support organization for individuals with lived experience of mental illness, hangs in the balance after losing a crucial grant bid. The organization, which has served Vermonters for over 30 years, relies⁤ heavily on grant funding to provide essential services like ⁣peer support groups, advocacy, and educational workshops.\n“This grant represented a critically important portion of our annual budget,” said Sarah Miller, VPS Executive Director. “Without it, we face some very difficult decisions about which programs we can continue to offer.”\nVPS has been a lifeline for countless Vermonters‌ navigating the complexities of mental health.Their peer-run programs offer a unique space⁢ for individuals to connect,‌ share experiences, and build resilience.\n“VPS has been my ‍rock,” shared John, a VPS⁤ member who wished to remain anonymous. “The support⁢ groups have helped me feel less alone and provided me with tools to manage my mental health.

    "text": "Is anyone ready to get off this roller-coaster weather ride we’ve been on this month? I sure am! The old saying was, ‘March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb’ but this year it’s been the opposite. All this up and down 70 degrees one day and 30 degrees the next has left me with the sniffles — but so far, despite it being a super busy week, I’m managing. It’s felt to me like March has been more jam-packed than usual. My BFF’s birthday was earlier this month so a few days before her birthday I treated her to what was her very first manicure. I actually have my friend Rachel to thank as she gave me a gift certificate for my 65th birthday celebration last fall so I used that to treat Deb and myself to a manicure and I only had to add a little to it. I originally wanted to schedule a mani-pedi for the both of us but that didn’t work out, so we’ll just have to schedule a pedicure for a later time. I was surprised she had NEVER had a professional manicure, but it’s not like I’ve had a ton either — I was in my 50’s before I had my first manicure. A former boyfriend treated me to one for my youngest son’s wedding and I continued going for awhile after that but then went back to doing my own nails. But it was fun, and Deb enjoyed it — it’s nice to get pampered once in a while. We went out to brunch afterwards. Last week we went to see the movie “Cabrini”, it was a last-minute decision and the only time I’d be able to go. A friend from church met us there, too and — wow — what a powerful movie! I realize it’s likely no longer playing in local theatres, but if you have an opportunity to see it or maybe stream it on Angel Studios, I highly recommend it. Although it took place in the late 1800’s-early 1900’s and focused on the plight of Italian immigrants in New York, I felt it was very timely with a message for our times. Plus, with March being Women’s History Month the story of Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini and the difference she made that is still felt today was also timely. There were several things said in the movie that stood out to me but one quote that really resonated with me was after being questioned about her ‘weak constitution’ she responded, “We can serve our weakness, or we can serve our purpose, but not both.” I love that! The next day was St. Patrick’s Day and I hosted one of my small groups from church and cooked my traditional St. Patrick’s Day dinner — not corned beef, but ham, cabbage, boiled potatoes, carrots and Irish Soda bread. We had to cut our monthly meeting a little short so we could attend a devotional talk and prayer service at our church, so that was a super busy day for me. No sooner was St. Patrick’s Day over then it was time to think about Easter. I know Easter has occurred in March before, but it seems to be coming so quick this year. That tells me time is moving faster and I’m getting slower. Aside from those events and my normal work and church meetings, this week has been what I affectionately call ‘chamber banquet season’ because I covered two different chamber of commerce’s award banquets and a women’s history month event. It’s work, but fun too to catch up with some people — whether it’s my own publishers, other media people, or other business owners and professionals. Sometimes, it’s an opportunity to make new connections for future stories, too. Then this coming week is Holy Week, so it’ll be another busy week of church services. I’ll have a delayed Easter celebration with my Fort Wayne crew as they have plans for Easter weekend so we’ll get together the week after — maybe the weather will be a bit more stable by then.",

    "text": "[Juan Pablo Latorre Gil ](/autores/juan-pablo-latorre-gil) Más del 30% de pruebas de paternidad que se realizan en Colombia son negativas, según estudio Según el estudio universitario, Bogotá es la ciudad en la que se han procesado el mayor número de análisis de laboratorio de paternidad. Un estudio universitario hecho en Colombia reveló que más del 30% de las pruebas de paternidad que se practican en Colombia, resultan ser negativas. De acuerdo con el análisis de datos recopilados por el Laboratorio de Identificación Humana (LIH) de la Universidad Manuela Beltrán, identificó que en los tres últimos años, es decir, entre el 2020 y el 2022, entre el 31 y 35% de las pruebas practicadas resultaron negativas.

El experto agregó que más del 20% de las personas citadas para realizarse dicho examen, no acude para practicárselo. \"Cifras del Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF) revelan que han sido procesadas más de 6.000 solicitudes de pruebas de paternidad, en el contrato que tiene activo con Medicina Legal para desarrollar este proceso. Sin embargo, solo 4.316 han podido ser practicadas, pues el 23 por ciento de los padres de familia involucrados (mujer u hombre) deciden no asistir a practicarse el procedimiento\", dijo. Agregó que los datos oficiales evidencian que de ese porcentaje, el progenitor (hombre) es quien principalmente no asiste con un 15 por ciento.

Dentro del análisis se encontró que de las casi 5.000 mil pruebas de ADN procesadas en tres años, en el 2% de los casos, alguno de los involucrados llega con una orden judicial. Aunque este tipo de pruebas no son obligatorias, la negación reiterativa del demandado a la práctica de la misma se tomará como indicio en su contra. ¿Qué pasa si se reconoce un hijo pero la prueba sale negativa? De acuerdo con la ley, para una impugnación se tienen 140 días después de haber reconocido al menor. Si se deja vencer ese plazo, habría que entrar a demostrar que se partió de una información errónea y el proceso puede ser largo, dada la congestión del sistema judicial colombiano. La prueba de filiación implica la toma de muestras del presunto padre y del hijo. Este examen se centra en regiones específicas del ADN para determinar la relación biológica con alta precisión. Cabe mencionar que la efectividad de la prueba es del 99.9%, brindando resultados concluyentes sobre la paternidad. Finalmente, cuando la prueba es ordenada dentro de un proceso judicial puede solicitarse el amparo de pobreza y si es concedido por el juez, eximirá a la parte que lo solicitó de reembolsar el costo.",

    "text": "▲類似DeepSeek的平價AI模型相繼問世，有望加速生成式邊緣AI應用蓬勃發展，進而帶動工業電腦新商機。（圖／鏡週刊提供，下同）\n圖、文／鏡週刊\n一場由中國新創DeepSeek掀起的「平價AI革命」，年初以來不但吸引特斯拉創辦人馬斯克推出Grok 3迎戰，連台灣科技巨擘鴻海也推出FoxBrain行動認同，本刊調查，隨著AI算力成本大減，讓向來擅長客製化的台灣工業電腦（IPC）廠商大為振奮，摩拳擦掌搶攻高達千億美元的邊緣運算商機，龍頭廠研華除在自家產線導入AI應用，旗下的研揚、融程電也陸續插旗。此外，振樺電也與宏碁策略結盟強化零售應用，就連專攻影像擷取卡的聰泰也來湊熱鬧。\n距離台灣9千公里遠的德國紐倫堡，原本是平靜的歐洲工業重鎮，今年的「嵌入式電子與工業電腦應用展」（Embedded World）卻格外熱鬧，因為台灣派出高達148家業者參展，規模居全球海外參展國之首，成了這場科技盛會的焦點。\n本刊調查，這次展會，因距離中國發布DeepSeek-R1模型僅短短數週，這款推理能力不亞於ChatGPT的低成本AI大語言模型（LLM），正在改寫AI市場規則，讓擅長打造工業電腦（簡稱：IPC）的台灣業者，紛紛看好生成式AI將加速在邊緣運算開發各種應用，頻頻在會場大秀肌肉。\n「不得不說，DeepSeek（簡稱：DS）崛起後，生成式邊緣AI語言模型越來越平（親）民。」資策會MIC資深產業分析師朱師右向本刊分析，DS是一種蒸餾技術（Knowledge Distillation）的應用，可使模型在保持高性能的同時，減少對高階AI晶片的依賴，｢相當適合資源有限的終端設備運行，這也是台灣IPC業者如此振奮的原因所在。」他推測。\n朱師右進一步指出，所謂邊緣AI的核心概念，就是將AI運算能力從雲端資料中心移轉至終端設備，使AI能夠直接在場域內進行資料處理與決策，無需依賴雲端運算，大幅降低訓練成本與延遲時間，這也讓工業電腦業者迎來全新的市場機會。\n資策會MIC產業分析師楊智傑則補充，AI的發展，依賴數據、算力與算法三大要素。過去，產業界習慣圍繞「算力」布局，但這是高額的硬體軍備賽；然而，DeepSeek和其他中小型模型的出現，讓業界開始重新思考：「AI的表現是否僅能仰賴強大算力？」若能透過精細的演算法改良，將數據梳理與過濾優化，同樣可以實現優秀的AI應用，這種「低算力、高效能」的思維，正在顛覆傳統AI產業思維。\n「過去，大語言模型（LLM）的回收期長、成本高，難以大規模應用，現在，DS的蒸餾技術可以將模型拆解為更小的單元，讓業者更能靈活部署，進而拉低整體成本，也就是所謂的小語言模型（SLM）。」研華邊緣伺服器事業副總鮑志偉向本刊表示，在邊緣裝置上導入GPT等大語言模型，因精準度的挑戰須回到雲端不斷訓練；然而，DS與Grok3這類開源模型，在壓縮模型的同時還能保持精確度，還能免費開放程式碼還能讓開發者微調後直接運用。\n鮑志偉進一步舉例：「這就像打造賽車，假設某家車廠開發出馬力超強的引擎，讓後進者難以望其項背，但後進者改變策略，採用稍微弱一點的引擎，卻透過更優化的導流設計提升穩定性，仍然有機會追上、甚至脫穎而出。「這種高性價比（CP值）模式，將吸引更多非一線雲端大廠投入，使邊緣AI應用更加百花齊放。」他說。\n「我認為，小語言模型（SLM）將會遍地開花，開源（open source）也將成為AI新普世價值，更不再是尖牙股等雲端巨頭的專利。」他大膽預言。",
