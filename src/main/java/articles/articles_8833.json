    "title": "'Immoral': Some Republicans rebuke efforts to kill immigration deal to help Trump",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Tempers flared Thursday as Republicans battled among themselves over whether to accept or reject a deal for tougher immigration laws, with some pushing back on colleagues who want to bow to former President Donald Trump's wishes and kill it. “The border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and Congress people that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem — because he wants to blame Biden for it — is really appalling,” Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told reporters. “The American people are suffering as a result of what’s happening at the border,” he said. “And someone running for president ought to try and get the problem solved, as opposed to saying, ‘Hey, save that problem! Don’t solve it! Let me take credit for solving it later.’” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., urged his colleagues not to make it all about politics at the behest of another candidate. “I didn’t come here to have the president as a boss or a candidate as a boss. I came here to pass good, solid policy,\\\" Tillis said. “It is immoral for me to think you looked the other way because you think this is the linchpin for President Trump to win.” Their comments came one day after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in a private GOP meeting, outlined the political difficulties facing the emerging deal on immigration and foreign aid, including opposition from Trump as he cruises to the Republican presidential nomination. The belief among some conservatives is that preventing an agreement will cause voters to blame President Joe Biden for a chaotic situation at the border, even though he has endorsed the negotiations. Trump's campaign declined to comment for this article. He has lambasted the deal on his social media platform, writing that Republicans should not \\\"do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING.\\\" While senators said McConnell made clear Thursday he wasn't withdrawing his support for the pact, some insist the party should reject it because it doesn't go far enough in sealing the border. The deal has not been finalized as congressional appropriators work through the funding provisions. “I want a negotiation that will actually secure the border, where they can’t weasel out of it, they can’t drive a semi-truck through loopholes that are created in it,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told reporters. “What Senate leadership hasn’t been able to describe is how the current negotiation, the elements that have been laid out for us, how that actually would work.” Johnson and a group of GOP senators held a press conference Wednesday blasting the deal, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who faces re-election this fall, calling it “utterly ineffective in fixing the problem” because it would only partially bring down the numbers of asylum-seekers. He called the deal “a fig leaf that pretends to do border security but doesn’t actually do border security.” 'Resign from the damn Senate' Cruz’s likely Democratic opponent this fall, Rep. Colin Allred, praised the “emerging bipartisan deal,” saying in a statement that “Texans desperately need us to take action” on the border crisis. “But once again, Ted Cruz is not interested in finding solutions, only partisan politics. Our border communities are overwhelmed, and can’t afford six more years of Ted Cruz and his cynical, partisan games.” Sen. Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, the chief Democratic negotiator, said it “shouldn’t be a shock to anybody that Donald Trump doesn’t want to fix the border” because he and “a lot of Republicans” are used to seeing it as “a political issue, not an actual policy problem.” “They are making a decision in the next 24 to 48 hours as to whether they want to solve the problem at the border or whether they just want to keep it live as a political issue,” he said. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who faces re-election in a red state seen as crucial to the majority in 2024, had a one-word response when asked to respond to the GOP push to sink the deal: “Bull-loney.” “I think it’s crap,” Tester told NBC News. “We need to get that deal done to secure the border. If they want to keep it as a campaign issue, I think they need to resign from the damn Senate.” Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, another red-state Democrat facing re-election, said: “They need to put politics aside and do this. The public wants it. They say they want it. We want it.” The fate of the deal looms over Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona Democrat-turned-independent, who is one of the lead negotiators and hasn’t decided whether she’ll run for re-election this fall. Polls show her trailing against the likely Democratic and Republican nominees in a hypothetical three-way race. Securing a deal could give her a campaign message to voters in a border state as she seeks to cultivate an image as a bridge-builder between the parties. Asked about Trump’s attempts to kill the deal, Sinema said: “I don’t really have a comment on that. Look, we’re at a place where this package is almost done. And when the text comes out, senators will be able to review it and make their own decision. Do they want to secure the border? It’s a choice.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., adjourned the chamber on Thursday afternoon, vowing that Democrats remain committed to the deal and that “negotiators will work all weekend in an effort to get this done.” While Democrats control the Senate 51-49, it would require 60 votes to break a guaranteed filibuster. And even then, there are no guarantees it can pass in a Republican-controlled House. “There are a good number of people for whom border security is too good an issue to give up,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. “And I do reject that. I’ve always rejected the notion that perfect has to be the standard.\\\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., inveighed against the immigration negotiations and said many Republicans are “just completely in the dark” about the details. He added that he spoke to Trump recently, but that they didn’t discuss border policy or Ukraine. “He talks about his election,” Scott said.",

    "text": "Los Angeles, California--(Newsfile Corp. - December 28, 2023) - Locker Room Insurance is a forward-thinking insurance brokerage co-founded by 2021 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Calvin Johnson Jr. and Rob Sims, his former NFL teammate, along with experienced business executive and licensed insurance agent Craig Freeman. Together, they're on a mission to elevate the insurance industry and reach underserved markets through Locker Room Insurance. Johnson Jr. , known for his Hall of Fame football career with the Detroit Lions, has been deeply engaged in community service since childhood, in part because he is the grandchild of a Baptist minister. His dedication led him to establish the Calvin Johnson Jr. Foundation , which has made a difference for nearly 13 years. \"The feeling you get from serving people is contagious. It feels great knowing I'm serving my neighbors and providing for families,\" Johnson Jr. said. Sims , a nine-year NFL veteran who also played with the Lions, shared a similar sentiment. \"We're big on finding solutions that benefit other people. It fills us with excitement to empower those without similar opportunities, enabling them to secure their family's financial future and enhance the community.\" To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8798/191320_bd8138025409e9b3_001full.jpg Freeman, a mission-driven executive known for his broad business acumen and servant leadership style, is equally excited about the program and its impact on the community. \"A quarter of the population doesn't have any type of insurance,\" Freeman observed. \"We want to be able to help. Rob and Calvin have a lot of people they love to help in various ways, but they can't take all of them to the NFL. They might also not be able to help them with other capital-intensive ventures. With insurance, they'll help many agents change their lives and their families' futures through a low barrier entrance, low capital insurance model.\" To get an in-person look at how they operate, apply for an opportunity to attend the Locker Room Insurance launch party in the Detroit area later this year, where they will hosting a NFL Playoff watch party as well as providing a business overview for prospective agents.

    "title": "Dont Fall For This Darknet Marketplace Scam",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn today’s digital age, a vast portion of commercial transactions has moved online. While the legitimate e-commerce industry flourishes, an underbelly of illicit trade has emerged on the “darknet.” Darknet markets, also known as cryptomarkets or underground marketplaces, operate in hidden corners of the internet, accessible only via specialized software such as Tor. These platforms have gained popularity among users for their perceived anonymity and ability to transact in illegal goods and services. This article aims to explore the darknet markets – their workings, challenges, and implications.\nBehind the Veil of the darknet market\nDarknet markets typically follow a similar model to mainstream online marketplaces, complete with listings, user ratings, and escrow services. However, these platforms predominantly facilitate the buying and selling of illicit substances, counterfeit goods, stolen personal information, weapons, hacking tools, and even hitman services. The anonymous nature of cryptocurrency payments and dark web market list the use of encryption methods contribute to the popularity of darknet markets.\nStructure and Operation\nDarknet markets employ an array of techniques to maintain anonymity, employing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to facilitate transactions. Pseudonyms or aliases are common, and vendors often establish reputations through buyer feedback systems. Escrow services, trusted moderators, and multi-signature wallets are used to mitigate scams and disputes.\nChallenges and Dangers\nWhile the darknet markets present a haven for illegal activities, they are far from the utopia of anonymity that users may perceive. Law enforcement agencies actively monitor these platforms, meticulously infiltrating them to apprehend both buyers and dark web sites sellers engaging in criminal activities. The closure of notorious marketplaces such as Silk Road, darknet market markets url AlphaBay, and Hansa serves as reminders that these platforms are not immune to intervention.\nThe darknet marketplace environment is rife with scams, fake products, and unreliable vendors. Users may face risks such as financial loss, identity theft, or even law enforcement entrapment. The unregulated nature of these markets also means that consumers are exposed to hazardous substances or untested narcotics, posing significant health risks.\nSocietal Implications\nThe existence of darknet markets raises significant concerns regarding public safety and the erosion of trust in online platforms. Governments worldwide are grappling with the challenges of tackling these illicit digital marketplaces, often through collaborative efforts between law enforcement agencies on an international scale. Striking the balance between preventing illegal transactions and protecting online privacy remains an ongoing challenge.\nConclusion\ndarknet market markets have become the haven for illegal trade and a platform for those seeking anonymity online. Operating in the shadows, these hidden cryptomarkets have facilitated the growth of illicit transactions, posing significant challenges to law enforcement agencies. With the use of sophisticated technologies and strategies, it is crucial to continue developing effective measures to combat this rise in illegal online activity. Balancing privacy and security is paramount to curbing the negative implications of these darknet marketplaces and maintaining trust in the online landscape.",

Al menos cuatro municipios han registrado cortes de energía eléctrica los cuales incluso afectaron la residencia de César Garza Villarreal, alcalde de Apodaca. “Aquí en Rinconada Colonial estamos sufriendo los cortes de energía eléctrica; se va y viene. El calor de la @ &$@ y apenas se puede dormir. Justo cuando comienza la crisis de calor, la CFE está rebasada. México necesita urgentemente una reforma eléctrica que mejore la distribución y promueve energías limpias”, escribió el munícipe. Pero no solamente la zona en la que vive Garza sufrió por la falta de luz, los reportes en redes sociales indican que Los Nogales y Privadas Borneo también se vieron afectadas. En Guadalupe la colonia Unión Modelo estuvo a oscuras durante unas siete horas. “Precisamente uno de los días más calientes del año y se va la luz. Adentro de la casa está más caliente que afuera. Sin poder dormir”, publicó el usuario de Facebook identificado como Rex. Los residentes de la colonia Mitras denunciaron que aproximadamente desde las 06:00 horas dejaron de tener el suministro eléctrico y todavía hasta la tarde del jueves seguían sin él. Otros ciudadanos recurrieron a X (antes Twitter) para señalar que tampoco tenían luz. “En la colonia Francisco Villa de Juárez la luz está intermitente. No es posible domir porque no se pueden encender los climas por miedo a que se descompongan”, compartió Celeste Díaz en Instagram. Agua lodosa Claudia Caballero, candidata a una diputación por el Distrito 18, exigió a Agua y Drenaje se aclare la situación por la que el agua sale lodosa en el municipio de San Pedro. Denunció que ya van dos semanas que el agua de la llave tiene una apariencia turbia con colores que van del naranja al café. Las colonias afectadas son San Pedro 400, Palo Blanco, El Rosario, Real San Agustín, San Ángely Bosques de la Montaña, entre otras. Hace dos semanas vecinos de la colonia Arcadia en Juárez denunciaron que el agua salía turbia y maloliente.",
