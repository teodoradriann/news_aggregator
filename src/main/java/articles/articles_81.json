    "text": "Buenos Aires, 13 sep (.).- Trabajadores de la aerolínea pública argentina secundan este viernes un paro por 24 horas, en medio de protestas para reclamar mejoras salariales, que afecta a unos 37.000 pasajeros y tendrá un impacto económico de 2,5 millones de dólares, según informaron fuentes oficiales.\nEl paro encabezado por la Asociación de Pilotos de Líneas Aéreas y la Asociación Argentina de Aeronavegantes afecta a decenas de miles de pasajeros tanto de Aerolíneas Argentinas como de otras compañías aéreas, pues también se resienten los servicios de rampa por las asambleas de trabajadores, informó la compañía de bandera.\nEn este marco, el Gobierno confirmó que habrá \"multas y sanciones\" y habló de \"profunda inmoralidad\" en el comportamiento de los pilotos de la línea de bandera, según dijo el portavoz presidencial, Manuel Adorni, en su habitual comparecencia en la Casa Rosada (sede del Ejecutivo).\n\"Los que paran hoy (...) van a ser, como corresponde, multados y sancionados. Además, tres pilotos de Aerolíneas Argentinas fueron despedidos por negarse a operar un avión\", afirmó.\nEl presidente argentino, Javier Milei, va a firmar hoy la reglamentación del artículo 182 del mega decreto de necesidad y urgencia (DNU), emitido en diciembre pasado, que \"establece los lineamientos para declarar la aeronáutico civil y comercial como servicio esencial\", adelantó el portavoz\nDías atrás, el Ministerio de Capital Humano explicó en un comunicado que \"se ha definido reglamentar la esencialidad de la actividad aeronáutico civil, aerocomercial pública y privada en todo el territorio nacional\" para garantizar \"servicios mínimos a la población\".\nEl sector aeronáutico está envuelto en protestas por la reclamación por mejoras salariales; entre ellas, el paro del 6 de agosto, que afectó a unos 15.000 pasajeros y 185 vuelos.\n\"Quienes no quieren resignar sus privilegios van a terminar fundiendo la empresa que tanto dicen querer defender\", concluyó Adorni, quien enumeró los \"privilegios\" corporativos de los pilotos.\nUn sindicalista que impulsa la protesta está de vacaciones en España junto a su familia \"haciendo uso de los beneficios corporativos que pagamos todos los argentinos\", denunció el portavoz, en alusión a Edgardo Llano, secretario general de la Asociación del Personal Aeronáutico (APA), quienes, según medios locales, se encuentra en ese país europeo.\nPor contra, añadió Adorni, \"hay gente que perdió por la medida (de fuerza) seguramente ahorros, tiempo, días de trabajo\".\nPor su parte, el secretario general de la Asociación Argentina de Aeronavegantes, Juan Pablo Brey, explicó a la radio Urbana Play que desde que asumió el Gobierno de Milei Aerolíneas Argentinas se encamina \"a la privatización\" y señaló que hay una estrategia del Ejecutivo \"de asfixiar\" a la compañía y a sus trabajadores.\nPese a que la privatización de Aerolíneas Argentinas era una aspiración del mandatario, la compañía quedó fuera del listado de empresas públicas susceptibles de ello que el Ejecutivo incluyó en su Ley de Bases y Puntos de Partida para la Libertad de los Argentinos -más conocida como 'ley bases'-.\nNo obstante, el partido Propuesta Republicana (PRO, centroderecha), fundado por el expresidente Mauricio Macri (2015-2019), presentó recientemente un proyecto de ley para su privatización.\n(foto) (video)\nUnos 37.000 afectados por paro 24 horas en Aerolíneas Argentinas por demandas salariales",

    "text": "White House walks back Biden's comments on new elections in Venezuela Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) President Joe Biden caused a stir on Thursday when he appeared to say he supports holding new presidential elections in Venezuela, following similar comments by his Brazilian counterpart earlier in the day. The South American nation is consumed by a political crisis after the Venezuelan National Electoral Council declared the country’s strongman, Nicolas Maduro, as the winner of the July 28 election, with numbers widely believed to be fraudulent and contested by the opposition. On Thursday, a Voice of America reporter asked Biden, “Do you support new elections in Venezuela?” to which he replied, “I do,” during brief comments to reporters in the afternoon at the White House. Earlier on Thursday, Brazil’s president, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, proposed that Maduro form a coalition government with the opposition or call for new presidential elections as possible solutions to the political crisis — ideas that the Venezuelan opposition has forcefully rejected. However, a National Security Council spokesperson said Biden was not calling for a new election but “speaking to the absurdity of Maduro and his representatives not coming clean about the July 28 elections” when he answered the question. “It is abundantly clear to the majority of the Venezuelan people, the United States, and a growing number of countries that Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia (the opposition candidate) won the most votes on July 28,” the spokesperson said. “The United States again calls for the will of the Venezuelan people to be respected and for discussions to begin on a transition back to democratic norms.” Several countries, including the United States and Brazil, have not recognized Maduro’s victory and have urged the Venezuelan National Electoral Council to release a detailed vote tabulation. The Biden administration has said it supports efforts by Brazil, Colombia and Mexico to facilitate talks between Maduro and the opposition. However, the White House has not called Gonzalez “president-elect” and avoids explicitly calling him the “winner” of the election, despite acknowledging that he won most of the votes. But Lula’s call for new elections, echoed by Colombian President Gustavo Petro in a publication on X, adds to the doubts about their that mediation efforts because Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has reiterated that the opposition will not negotiate the electoral results nor share power with Maduro. “So we are going to a second election. If they don´t like the results, are we going to a third, fourth or fifth election until Maduro likes the result? Will you accept that in your countries?” she told reporters after Lula’s comments to Brazilian Radio T were published Thursday morning. Speaking of Brazil and Colombia’s efforts to find a solution to the crisis, Lula suggested Maduro “can form a coalition government with the opposition” or call for new elections. “Maduro still has six months left in his term,” Lula said. “He is the president regardless of the election. If he has good sense, he could call upon the people of Venezuela, perhaps even call for new elections, create an electoral committee and allow observers from around the world to monitor.” He said he “still did not” recognize Maduro’s electoral victory but also did not acknowledge the evidence of the vote presented by the opposition and validated by the Carter Center and other independent entities, showing that opposition candidate Gonzalez won in a landslide with 67% of the vote. “Those who want the opposition to win, I can’t say the opposition won because I don’t have the data. And I can’t say Maduro won because I don’t have the data,” Lula said. He urged the Venezuelan National Electoral Council, which has not presented the tabulation of the vote despite calls by the international community, to say “who won.” Maduro “knows he owes an explanation to his people and the world,” he said",

    "title": "B.C. odour incidents spark questions around corporate ethics and communication",
    "text": "Vancouver resident Robert Ford was heading to a yoga class Sunday morning when he smelled an odour he likened to \"semi-burnt fuel.\" As a member of council at his Kitsilano apartment building, he said he decided to check the boiler room, but it smelled fine. \"I was expecting something in there, so that was strange. I scratched my head and I went to the front door, which is right across from the beach, and it was 10 times more powerful outside,\" he said. He immediately began searching online for an explanation but didn't find any answers until almost four hours later. \"I'm just kind of perplexed at how we can have such a nasty event with no public information hardly,\" he said. It was one of two acrid odours that spread over parts of Metro Vancouver in less than a week, raising questions about corporate responsibility to inform the public when such events cause widespread concern and confusion but fall short of health and safety breaches. The smell Ford referred to was revealed to be \"an unplanned issue\" with a Parkland fuel refinery processing unit in neighbouring Burnaby. The heavy stench, which Ford compared to jet fuel, blanketed parts of Metro Vancouver and caused more than 100 complaints from local residents. It came just days after a \"controlled release of gas\" from a FortisBC interconnect station in nearby Delta, B.C., prompted criticisms from Mayor George Harvie and numerous residents that the utility didn't notify the public for more than four hours. Harvie said the heavy odour caused stress and panic in the community, and a flood of calls to local police and fire departments hampered Delta's emergency response services. A statement from Fortis said it was investigating after an elevated level of the odorant added to natural gas was unknowingly sent out in a controlled release of gas. Carol Liao, a University of B.C. Sauder fellow at the Dhillon centre for business ethics, said these incidents are not necessarily matters for legislation, but rather about accountability and ethics. \"Businesses obviously need to obey bylaws, but they also need to understand that beyond that, there is a need to act responsibly to maintain public trust,\" she said. \"If a business is the cause of a terrible odour that's impacting the surrounding community and beyond, it should act as a good corporate citizen and own up to the problem right away, alert public officials, alert those possibly impacted and in harm's way, mitigate the damage and be accountable.\" Harvie said he was involved in both incidents as Delta's mayor and as chair of Metro Vancouver's regional district. \"The difference between the two was (in) Metro Vancouver, air quality inspectors were on scene at the refinery, so we had more accurate information being fed back to us,\" he said. Metro Vancouver monitors emissions of particulates, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide from the Parkland refinery, and the district has said air quality objectives for the contaminants weren't exceeded Sunday. But, Harvie said the Fortis incident was different. \"The one from Fortis was very disturbing to me and it does speak a lot about corporate values (and) corporate responsibilities. They kept the information away from us,\" he said. \"This was just unacceptable.\" Harvie took to the social media site X after the smell covered an area stretching from the Tsawwassen ferry terminal to more than 30 kilometres away in Vancouver. The mayor said he had contacted FortisBC requesting an urgent followup meeting. The Fortis statement released on Wednesday said work was being performed on new equipment, which was not connected to the gas system, and while a controlled release of gas was planned, the release of odour was not. \"Further review is underway to determine why there was an elevated level of odorant in the equipment,\" it said. \"Although the controlled release of gas at the interconnect station on Jan. 16 contained an elevated level of this odorant, it is not harmful and there are no immediate or long-term health effects.\" Fortis said it had been in contact with local First Nations, municipal and emergency officials, including Harvie, as well as government regulators, to provide information on its response. \"We have also started a review of the incident and are working with relevant stakeholders during this process.\" Kevin Farrow, technical director of Parkland, said in an interview that the refinery had paused processing operations earlier this month due to extreme cold weather. \"It was during that restart of the refinery, that one of the processing units had a plugged line, which ultimately led to the plume and odour that many experienced on Sunday,\" he said. \"We've launched a review to better understand the root cause of what happened and how we got into this situation.\" Parkland had issued an advisory on its website two days before the plume, alerting people who live nearby that they may notice noise and \"higher than usual flare\" from the facility. In a timeline created by the refinery and sent to The Canadian Press, the company said the incident happened around 7:30 a.m. Sunday. It said Metro Vancouver had been notified by 8:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m., the Burnaby Fire Department and the RCMP had created a perimeter around the facility as a safety precaution. The RCMP was called off at 11:26 a.m., while the fire department remained in place until 3:15 p.m., the timeline said. The refinery's first public statement Sunday was issued at 11 a.m., notifying the public of an incident that cause elevated smoke, odours and particulate matter. That was followed up at 12:30 p.m. with a media advisory, announcing the shut down of operations. While some, including Ford in Kitsilano, believe communication needs to come sooner to alleviate panic, Farrow said the \"priority\" of the refinery is to \"communicate accurate and confirmed information to the public.\" \"We have that information now,\" he said. \"We understand more, and we've begun to reach out to our community partners and to our neighbours, (and) you can expect a lot more information from the refinery in the coming days and weeks.\" Farrow noted the refinery remains shut down but the company announced it would be conducting a \"controlled and necessary operational procedure\" on Thursday. \"We do not expect any impacts of the community. We're just making them aware, just in case anything were to occur,\" Farrow said. Metro Vancouver also issued an updated air quality bulletin Wednesday night, saying it \"will be closely monitoring\" as the refinery conducts the operation \"that may result in odour, smoke and flaring.\" While some residents expressed concern about the announcement online, Liao applauded the move, saying an advanced public statement can be \"immensely helpful in ensuring transparency and accountability to the surrounding communities.\" \"It helps avoid any public confusion and the tying up of resources such as 911 calls, while also mitigating risk,\" she said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024. Brieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said there was a gas leak at a FortisBC plant.",

These crystals are believed to have unique frequencies that interact with human energy fields, potentially promoting clearer thinking, better focus, and an overall sense of mental balance.\nThe idea is that when the mind is cluttered or out of balance, it can lead to poor decision-making, lack of focus, and even emotional turmoil. By incorporating specific crystals into daily routines, individuals claim to experience enhanced mental clarity, reduced stress, and greater cognitive function. This exploration looks at how certain crystals can help in clearing mental fog and supporting individuals in staying centered, calm, and sharp.\nThe Science Behind Crystals and Mental Clarity The belief in the healing powers of crystals lies in their vibrational energy. According to proponents, each crystal emits a specific frequency that resonates with different parts of the body’s energy system. This resonance is thought to clear blockages and restore balance, leading to improved physical, mental, and emotional health.\nFor mental clarity, certain crystals are chosen for their ability to interact with the mind and stimulate cognitive function. Clear quartz, for example, is often referred to as the “master healer” because it amplifies energy and thought, clearing mental fog and boosting mental clarity. It is believed to help people think more clearly and focus better by amplifying positive energy while dispelling negative thought patterns. Similarly, amethyst is used for enhancing concentration and clarity, while fluorite is known for its ability to clear confusion and focus the mind on what’s most important. By using Pyramid Spiritual Devices & Healing Crystals, people often report more focused, clearer thinking, which may help them in both daily tasks and higher cognitive functions.\nCrystals for Stress Reduction and Focus Stress is one of the biggest mental barriers to clarity. When the mind is overwhelmed with worry or tension, it becomes difficult to focus and make decisions. Certain healing crystals are believed to have calming properties that can reduce stress and improve overall mental health. By calming the mind, these crystals help bring clarity to thoughts and decisions.\nAmethyst, for example, is often used to reduce stress and promote mental calm. This crystal has been linked with reducing anxiety and promoting inner peace, which helps individuals focus on their tasks more efficiently. Lapis lazuli, a crystal known for its calming effects, can help release stress and encourage a peaceful mind. By using Pyramid Spiritual Devices & Healing Crystals, which work synergistically to amplify the effects of these individual stones, users can experience enhanced relaxation and clarity. The combined energy of these devices and crystals can help reduce mental strain, making it easier for the mind to function clearly.\nThe Role of Crystals in Clearing Mental Blockages Mental clarity is often hindered by mental blockages—negative thought patterns, unresolved emotional issues, or even external influences that drain energy. Crystals are believed to clear these blockages, allowing for smoother mental processes and better cognitive performance.\nCitrine is a crystal known for its ability to clear negative energy and stimulate the mind. By working on the solar plexus chakra, citrine is said to clear mental blockages that prevent individuals from achieving a clear and focused mind. Similarly, smoky quartz helps ground and clear emotional baggage, which can often cloud mental clarity. Both citrine and smoky quartz work together to remove negative influences and restore mental flow, allowing for clearer thinking. Pyramid Spiritual Devices & Healing Crystals further enhance the cleansing and balancing process by helping to focus and amplify the energy of these stones, creating a more powerful environment for mental clarity and mental freedom.\nIncorporating Healing Crystals into Your Daily Routine To experience the benefits of healing crystals for mental clarity, many people incorporate them into their daily lives through simple practices. Crystals can be carried throughout the day as pocket stones, placed on a desk or workspace, or even used in meditation. Meditation with healing crystals is a popular method, as it helps to still the mind, reduce distractions, and focus on present thoughts and emotions. By setting clear intentions for the use of specific crystals, individuals can focus on enhancing their mental clarity and well-being.\nFor example, holding a piece of clear quartz or fluorite during meditation can help clear the mind and promote focused thinking. Additionally, keeping stones like citrine or amethyst close during periods of work or study is believed to support concentration and reduce mental fatigue. Many people also use Pyramid Spiritual Devices & Healing Crystals to amplify the energy of their crystals, enhancing their ability to create an environment conducive to mental clarity. This practice not only improves focus but also encourages a more peaceful and organized mindset throughout the day.\nHow Long Does It Take to Experience Results? While some individuals report immediate results after using healing crystals, the effects can vary based on the individual and the level of commitment to using them. Crystals are most effective when used consistently and with intention. Over time, as the mind becomes accustomed to the calming and clarifying energies of these stones, it is believed that mental clarity will improve gradually.\nResults may also depend on the type of crystal being used and the severity of mental fog or stress the individual is experiencing. Some people may notice an immediate boost in focus and concentration, while others may need to incorporate crystals into their daily routine for several weeks before experiencing noticeable changes. Patience is key in the process of using healing crystals for mental clarity, and with consistent practice, many people report significant improvements in their mental state, including increased focus, sharper thinking, and reduced stress.\nConclusion: Healing crystals are increasingly recognized for their potential to promote mental clarity by calming the mind, reducing stress, and clearing blockages. Pyramid Spiritual Devices & Healing Crystals can amplify the energy of these stones, enhancing their ability to help individuals achieve clearer thinking and focused decision-making. Whether through stress reduction, emotional healing, or the clearing of mental blockages, crystals provide a natural and holistic method for improving cognitive function and mental clarity.\nAs individuals continue to explore the benefits of crystals, many find that they play a crucial role in enhancing their mental well-being. By incorporating these tools into daily routines, individuals can support their efforts to stay clear-headed, calm, and focused. For those seeking mental clarity and inner peace, healing crystals provide a valuable resource for achieving a more balanced and focused mind.",
