    "text": "Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar said Hindu girls were being force to offer ‘Namaaz’ in the Kota school. (Photo: X)\nRajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar has suspended two Kota-based government school teachers and initiated an inquiry against a third for their alleged involvement in religious conversion, love jihad, and ties to banned jihadi outfits.\nThe suspension orders of the teachers, posted at a school in Kota’s Sangod block, were issued on Thursday night by the Kota education officer (secondary).\nMinister Madan Dilawar released a video statement on the matter and said, “In the Khajoori village of Sangod panchayat samiti in Kota district, the religion of a girl in senior secondary school was mentioned as ‘Islam’ in the transfer certificate of a girl despite her being a Hindu. A conspiracy of religious conversion and ‘love jihad’ is happening there. Hindu girls are being forced to offer namaz. This has come to our notice.”\nExplaining the reason behind his move, he said, “As soon as this was brought to my notice, I decided to take strict action against three teachers. In this context, I suspended two teachers – Firoz Khan and Mirza Mujahideen. Further action is being taken against one Shabana. All three of them have been sent to Bikaner. I will take strict action against them after a detailed investigation. If needed, I will expel them.”\nThe minister ordered action against the teachers after a local group, Sarv Hindu Samaj, Sangod gave him a memorandum on the matter.\nAccording to a report in The Indian Express, the memorandum also alleged that three teachers have connections with banned outfits and that they had links to Pakistani groups. The memorandum also stated that an FIR had previously been registered in this regard at Sangod police station, but no action was taken.\nThe suspended teachers were identified as Mirza Mujahid and Firoz Khan, the report mentioned.\nLove jihad’ is a term often used by right-wing activists to allege a ploy by Muslim men to lure Hindu women into religious conversion through marriage. All three teachers have been ordered to report to the directorate of education, Bikaner during this period, as per the order.",

    "title": "Therapist warns about 'red flags' that may indicate your partner only proposed to get you to 'shut up'",
    "text": "A therapist has shared the &#039;red flags&#039; that may indicate your partner only proposed to you to get you to &#039;shut up.&#039; Back in July, an Australian influencer named Monica Millington went viral after she recounted how her first marriage ended in divorce. The social media star, 33, explained that she tied the knot with a &#039;decent man&#039; when she was 23, despite knowing deep down that they &#039;were just not a good match.&#039; They ultimately divorced after three years of marriage, and looking back, she now believes that her ex-husband only asked her to marry him because she continuously pressured him to walk down the aisle. Monica said she was convinced that becoming husband and wife would solve their problems, and that her reluctant boyfriend ended up giving her a &#039;shut up ring&#039; after she &#039;literally begged&#039; him to marry her. Wedding therapist Landis Bejar has shared the &#039;red flags&#039; that may indicate your partner only proposed to you to get you to &#039;shut up&#039; Now, wedding therapist Landis Bejar, from Atlanta, Georgia, has spoken to Business Insider about the topic, and she admitted that rushing to the altar to please a partner even if you don&#039;t want to was more common than some may think. &#039;[A shut-up ring is] used to pacify or relieve some pressure that&#039;s going on in a relationship,&#039; Landis dished of the phenomenon. She explained that many woman tend to want to marry their partner despite there being &#039;red flags&#039; in the relationship, because they believe putting a ring on it will prove the man is &#039;committed to them&#039; and &#039;prioritizing them.&#039; But in reality, she said that marriage won&#039;t fix your problems, but would only make them worse in the end. &#039;It&#039;s an early indicator that the couple can&#039;t talk about hard things and can&#039;t work through hard things,&#039; she explained. &#039;Instead, one person decides to appease the other person instead of voicing how they really feel about it.&#039; Landis, who specializes in &#039;helping brides and grooms navigate the stresses of wedding planning through therapy,&#039; said the key to preventing this from happening was communication. &#039;You gotta have conversations where you allow the other person to be honest about how they feel,&#039; she continued. Back in July, an Australian influencer named Monica Millington went viral after she revealed that she was given a &#039;shut up ring&#039; during her first marriage She said many woman tended to want to marry their partner despite there being &#039;red flags&#039; in the relationship (stock image) @monicamillington Replying to @ahhwell i havent had my morning coffee yet if you cant tell 😅 #shutupring #marriagetok #extok #divorcetok #lifeafterdivorce ♬ original sound - Monica | Big sis advice - Monica | Big sis advice &#039;This doesn&#039;t have to be an aggressive conversation. It can be warm and loving and filled with hope. But you gotta talk about it.&#039; As for &#039;red flags&#039; to look for, she said partners who weren&#039;t really ready to get married would often make promises but failed to follow through with them. In addition, if you&#039;re &#039;constantly giving the same feedback and asking for the same thing in different presentations&#039; from your partner, it&#039;s not a good sign. While sometimes it was hard, she stressed the importance of accepting when someone just wasn&#039;t right for you and let them go. &#039;[People] are not prepared to say, &quot;I&#039;m not going to try to change you anymore,&quot;&#039; she added. &#039;Without that, then you&#039;ll tolerate whatever, or you&#039;ll keep complaining, and either you&#039;ll be upset all the time, or you might get something like a shut-up ring that just alleviates the complaining in the short term but doesn&#039;t lead to what you actually want, which is [a happy] marriage.&#039;",

    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 28 T he Big Five tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta collectively added a whopping $3.9 trillion to their stock value in 2023, the highest figure in the market's history, a new report revealed on Thursday. he Big Five tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta collectively added a whopping $3.9 trillion to their stock value in 2023, the highest figure in the market's history, a new report revealed on Thursday. Tech stocks have dominated the 2023 stock market performance. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), combined with the improving economy and slowing inflation, has helped the sector come into the spotlight, with many investors jumping back on the tech train, according to Stocklytics.com. The Nasdaq experienced a significant increase of 32 per cent in the first half of the year, which can be attributed to Apple's rapid growth and Nvidia's success. This marks the best first half performance in the last four decades. Additionally, the upward trend in the stock prices of tech companies has continued, leading to the largest players in the market adding trillions of dollars to their stock values. According to YCharts data, the combined stock value of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta amounted to $6.17 trillion in December last year. Since then, this figure has surged by 62 per cent or $3.9 trillion and hit more than $10 trillion, representing the biggest annual increase so far. In 2019, their combined stock value grew by $1.73 trillion. In 2020 and 2021, when the tech market boomed due to Covid-19, the market's largest players increased their stock value by $2.6 trillion. Moreover, the report showed Meta was the best performer in the Big Tech group this year. After losing two-thirds of its stock value in 2022, Meta's market cap has surged by an impressive 188 per cent (year-over-year), the biggest increase among the Big Five tech giants. In December 2022, Meta's stock value was $315.5 billion, and now it’s over $908 billion. Amazon has witnessed the second-largest increase of 84 per cent, driving its market cap to over $1.5 trillion, the figure last seen in mid-2022, the report mentioned. Microsoft and Alphabet's market caps jumped by 55 per cent (year-over-year), helping the two companies add more than $1.6 trillion in value. Apple stocks have jumped 45 per cent since last December, crossing $3 trillion in market cap.

    "title": "A new uranium mine has opened near the Grand Canyon. What this means for tribal lands | Fronteras",
    "text": "A new uranium mine has opened near the Grand Canyon. What this means for tribal lands A federal ban has prohibited uranium mining around the Grand Canyon for years. But now, a new mine has begun operations just seven miles south of Grand Canyon National Park. The Pinyon Plain mine comes in response to demand. The U.S. is trying to boost domestic production of uranium, which is needed for nuclear energy, and to lead us away from dependence on fossil fuels. But, the Havasupai Tribe has long opposed the mine. They say it could contaminate their only source of water and damage cultural sites. It also lies within a new national monument designated in the area by President Joe Biden last year. The Show spoke with Maanvi Singh, west coast reporter for the Guardian, about what this all means. LAUREN GILGER: Good morning, Maanvi. MAANVI SINGH: Good morning. Thanks so much for having me. GILGER: Thanks for coming on. So, OK, we've got uranium mining in the area that hasn't been allowed for years and that it's the fact that this is within the boundaries of this new national monument the president designated just last year. How did this mine come to be? How is it going? SINGH: Yeah, so this is this mine has had a lot of opposition. And when Joe Biden designated the area around the Grand Canyon last year, it did you know, stop new mines from coming up. But because of this Gold Rush-era mining law that still governs the way we do mining today, the Monument Declaration did not negate this company's claim to the mine because mines that were under development prior to the declaration were exempted from the ban. GILGER: OK. So tell us more about the concerns from the Havasupai tribe in particular. What have they been saying? How, why have they been fighting this for decades? SINGH: So these are their ancestral lands that were taken from them and the mine is right up against two of their most sacred sites. And on top of that, they and environmentalists in the region are really concerned that if anything goes wrong at the mine, it's gonna contaminate their aquifer, which is their sole source of water in a very arid region where water is scarce. And then separately, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe is concerned about air pollution from a nearby mill facility where this uranium is going to be taken and processed? GILGER: OK. Are those claims verified? Like what does the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality say? SINGH: Yeah, so there's some disagreement here. Energy Fuels Inc the company that's, you know, doing this mine. They say that there is no scientific evidence that the aquifer is at risk. And the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality says that they have reviewed years of data including from the geological survey and they have determined that the layers of rock between the mine and the aquifer are impermeable. So they're saying there's no risk of contamination. GILGER: You quoted one tribal member in your story though about this, who said that they all kind of knew this might eventually happen. Why did she say that? SINGH: You know, she Carletta Tilousi, who I interviewed, she was a formal former council member and she's been fighting against this mine for years. She said, you know, they've been fighting for generations. So the generation before her was also fighting uranium in the region, and they kind of just saw this as an inevitability. They fought really hard against it but they're up against, you know, this 1872 mining law and just really the way the structure around this is set up is really, it makes it really difficult for tribes to, to fight, you know, these mine constructions or even have really input on how it's done. GILGER: And there are sort of, there's a lot of this around that area, right? Like there are abandoned mines, tainted aquifers all over that region. SINGH: Yeah. So that's where it really, you know, that's where the Havasupai are really sort of skeptical. So they're like, OK, you're saying this is safe, you're saying that the science backs you up here, but we've been burned before and really like uranium mining in the 20th century has this really dark shameful legacy of destroying indigenous communities in the Southwest. You know, uranium mining littered the Navajo Nation with just abandoned mines, and it really exploited and then abandoned this generation of Dine workers and their families who now are still dealing with like this legacy of lung cancer and other illness. So there's like a lot of, there's a lack of trust there. GILGER: Tell us about the the global demands here, like the broader picture in terms of uranium. Uranium prices were down for years, there was not a lot of demand. Now there is, this has to do with Cop28. SINGH: Yeah, so, I mean, in general, it has to do with this you know, desire to transition away from fossil fuels and to address the climate crisis. At Cop28 there was an agreement, the U.S. was a part of to triple nuclear energy production as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. So that's boosted demand. And there's this other factor which is you know, since Russia invaded Ukraine, there's this desire to kind of move away from Russia as a source of uranium and that's really a country that's dominated the industry. And so now the U.S. is really wanting to make more of it. GILGER: Are we expecting you think to see more of this on the horizon? More battles like this over these kinds of minds because you know, this desire for a clean energy future isn't going away. SINGH: Yeah, that's, that's kind of a big one. It's not just uranium, but also cobalt, copper. You know, we're really going to need these minerals in order to make that green energy transition. And really what I heard from the Havasupai and just environmentalists in the region is like, yes, we do want to address the climate crisis. We agree that there needs to be a transition. But in making that transition, we really don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past. We don't want to repeat the mistakes of the fossil fuel industry or, you know, we want to be consulted. We want to be part of the decision making process and maybe reform this really outdated law. GILGER: Yeah. All right, we'll leave it there. Maanvi Singh, West Coast reporter for the Guardian, joining us to talk more about this uranium mine near the Grand Canyon. Maanvi, thank you for coming on. I appreciate it. SINGH: Thank you.",
