    "text": "Lawmakers are condemning a recent defacement of a Hindu temple in Newark, Calif., that local authorities are looking into as a possible hate crime. Authorities are investigating the vandalizing of the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple with graffiti as a possible hate crime, according to a report from The Mercury News. The defacing of the temple was found Friday morning. “I unequivocally condemn this attack on Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple in California. Hatred in all forms cannot be tolerated,” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday. “Those responsible must be held accountable.” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) joined Lee in condemning the defacing in a post as well. “The defacing of the Swaminarayan temple in Newark, CA is despicable, and I strongly condemn it,” Krishnamoorthi said in his X post. “I’m glad the community is rallying to the support of the mandir. We must stand united against bigotry in all its ugly forms. Those who did this vandalism must be held accountable.” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) also said he condemned the defacing of the temple, which he said is in his district. “Freedom to worship is at the heart of American democracy,” Khanna said in a post on X. “Those who committed this act of vandalism must be held accountable.” “As the founder of the Congressional Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Jain Caucus, I express my profound condemnation of the disgraceful act of vandalism committed against the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Newark, California,” Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) said in a statement posted to X. “This desecration, marked by anti-India graffiti, strikes at the very essence of our diverse and inclusive society.” The Newark Police Department said that the temple’s defacement seems to be targeted, according to The Mercury News. “Any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority,” the Newark Police Department said in a news release, according to The Mercury News. “Officers are investigating, collecting evidence, and reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses in order to establish the chain of events and bring those responsible to justice.” The Hill has reached out to the Newark Police Department.

    "text": "More details are emerging about the changes made to the controversial Mulé amendment, which could be enough to prevent FIFA and UEFA excluding Serie A and Italy over Government interference.\nThere are very strict rules in European and World football to ensure the sporting federations have total independence from politics.\nA letter from FIFA and UEFA to Minister for Sport Andrea Abodi had warned that the so-called Mulé amendment would breach those rules and “if the text remains the same, we would have to exclude Italian teams from European cup competition.”\nIt could also see Italy stripped of the hosting rights for the EURO 2032 tournament, which they currently hold in conjunction with Turkey.\nThe Mulé amendment was passed this evening , but although the politician behind it – Giorgio Mulé – declares it a huge victory, the wording appears to have changed significantly from the original.\nMany of the points that caused problems have been removed, including the ability for clubs to bypass the sporting justice system and appeal directly to the TAR tribunal – a civil court.\nThe clause allowing the Lega Serie A to forge independence from the Federation, an attempt to copy the way the Premier League broke away from the English Football Association, has also seemingly been cut, along with the Serie A power of veto over reforms.\nControversial amendment stripped down for Serie A The only remaining element of interest is the ruling that the Lega Serie A must have ‘adequate representation’ within the FIGC board.\n“Now it will be easier for the Federation, if they want also with our contribution, to find a balanced and common sense solution to the issue treated by the amendment, and even bigger questions that have not found answers over the years in the football system,” said Minister for Sport Abodi.\nLega Serie A President Lorenzo Casini still considered the watered-down version a victory for his position.\n“This will give more representation to the Lega Serie A in the federal system. It represents, after years, a first important achievement. This is the first, indispensable, step in the journey of reforms that Serie A has been requesting for a long time.”\nCasini even said that this is the Italian football equivalent of the Boston Tea Party, quoting the phase “no taxation without representation.”",

    "title": "Bladder cancer treatment can be better targeted and more effective, trials show",
    "text": "Testing for tumor DNA in the blood can successfully identify advanced bladder cancer patients who will not relapse following surgery, new research shows. This could allow doctors to target treatments more effectively to those who need it, and spare those patients for whom further treatment is unnecessary, researchers say. The findings from the screening phase of the IMvigor011 Phase III trial are presented 5 April at the European Association of Urology Congress in Paris .). They show that just over 90% of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients with a negative circulating DNA (ctDNA) test following surgery, which remained negative on follow up, did not relapse. The findings mean that use of a ctDNA test could allow some patients to be spared further treatment with minimal risk. MIBC is an advanced form of bladder cancer, where the tumor has spread into the bladder wall. The disease is usually treated by surgery to remove the bladder. Around half of patients see cancer return, often in the lungs and usually within two-to-three years. All patients are currently offered follow-up treatment such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy to prevent recurrence, for which the side effects can be serious and lifechanging. Other Phase III trial results, also presented at the EAU Congress today, show that patients given immunotherapy, nivolumab, as a follow up to surgery have an average survival of nearly six years, compared to four for patients on placebo. The CheckMate 274 trial has already shown that nivolumab can reduce recurrence of disease, but these interim results are the first to show the potential benefit in overall survival for MIBC patients. Joost Boormans, Professor of Urology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, and member of the EAU Scientific Congress Office, is chairing the session where both trials will present their findings. He said, \"Although we already knew that nivolumab improved disease-free survival in MIUC patients who received radical surgery, overall survival is what really matters following local treatment, such as radical surgery. These interim findings, which show that overall survival also improves, are very encouraging, particularly as this hasn't been the case in other recent immunotherapy trials. \"The question for regulators and health care authorities is whether the improvement in overall survival is enough to justify licensing or prescribing the drug for all patients, in the knowledge that some of these patients would have been cured of their cancer by surgery alone. \"This is where the findings from the IMvigor011 trial could really make a difference, by allowing us to select patients at highest risk who will benefit the most from treatment while sparing others for whom it isn't needed. \"At a time when health care resources are under pressure, this kind of innovation is really needed.\" IMvigor011 IMvigor011 is a global, double-blind, randomized Phase III trial looking at the efficacy of the immunotherapy atezolizumab vs. placebo in patients with high-risk MIBC. The trial is recruiting MIBC patients post-surgery and testing their blood for circulating tumor DNA. Those with a positive ctDNA result are randomized to receive either atezolizumab or placebo. Those with a negative result are given no further treatment, but were followed up with scans and further ctDNA tests for up to two years. For the analysis presented at the EAU Congress today, 171 patients with a negative ctDNA test were included, with follow up continuing on a further 115. Just 17 patients of the 171 patients (9.9%) saw their cancer return within two years. These outcomes were irrespective of the stage their tumor was at or whether it showed elevated levels of PD-L1, a protein biomarker that plays a role in cancer. Professor Thomas Powles of Barts Cancer Institute leads the IMvigor011 trial. He said, \"These results are even better than we were hoping. The risk of relapse in this ctDNA group of patients is just 1 in 10. It appears this test can effectively filter patients into two groups: those who are likely to relapse and those at much lower risk. \"Focusing treatment on those at risk and sparing the very low risk group potentially life-altering treatment-related side effects is attractive. Hopefully these data will allow patients to remain treatment free with the reassurance they need, that they're unlikely to see their cancer return.\" CheckMate 274 CheckMate 274 is a global, Phase III, randomized, double-blind trial of nivolumab vs. placebo in high-risk MIBC after surgery. The trial recruited just over 700 patients, with half given nivolumab and the other half given a placebo every two weeks for 12 months following an operation to remove the bladder. Patients were also tested to see if their cancer had elevated levels of the biomarker PD-L1, which nivolumab specifically targets. The trial has already reported positive results in preventing recurrence, particularly for PD-L1 patients. Across all patients, those on nivolumab had an average of 22 months before recurrence, compared to 10 months for those on placebo. However, of the PD-L1 group, those on nivolumab had an average of over four years without recurrence, compared to just over eight months for those on placebo. The latest results, although still early stage, show a similar benefit in overall survival. For all patients, those on nivolumab survive on average for nearly six years (69.5 months) compared to just over four years (50.1 months) for those on placebo. The researchers do not yet have enough follow-up data to separate out the PD-L1 patients, but the analysis so far shows that overall survival is likely to also be even better for this group when treated with nivolumab versus placebo. Professor Matthew Galsky from the Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, leads the CheckMate 274 trial. He said, \"We know that patients with high-risk urothelial cancer are at highest risk for recurrence within the first three years after surgery. We've now followed a substantial subset of patients for longer than that on this study without recurrence. \"It looks as if the improvement in disease free survival is ultimately going to translate into improvement in overall survival. And that's for all patients, but particularly patients with the PD-L1 biomarker. Our hope is that this improvement will then translate into an increased likelihood of curing cancer in these patients.\" More information: Clinical outcomes in patients (pts) with high-risk, post-cystectomy muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with persistent circulating tumour DNA-negative (ctDNA-) status on serial testing: surveillance analysis from the IMvigor011 study by Thomas Powles et al is presented by Professor Thomas Powles at EAU24 on Friday 5 April, 2024 Extended follow-up from CheckMate 274 including the first report of overall survival outcomes by Matthew Galsky et al is presented by Professor Matthew Galsky at EAU24 on Friday 5 April, 2024.
