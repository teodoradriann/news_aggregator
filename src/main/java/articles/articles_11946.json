    "text": "“Ley Uber”: Ministerio de Transportes retira polémico reglamento de Contraloría Este jueves, el Ministerio de Transportes y Telecomunicaciones retiró de Contraloría el polémico reglamento de la llamada “Ley Uber”, que ha sido criticado por las aplicaciones de transportes debido a las exigencias que establecerá a los conductores. Por su parte, los diputados de la bancada UDI, Cristóbal Martínez, Natalia Romero y Flor Weisse, valoraron la decisión del Gobierno de retirar el reglamento. El cual, estaba generando una enorme inquietud en las distintas aplicaciones como Uber, Didi y Cabify. De todas maneras, Martínez, Romero y Weisse reiteraron la necesidad de flexibilizar las exigencias que propuso el Ministerio de Transportes, asegurando que el objetivo de la ley es regularizar un servicio que se estaba masificando en nuestro país, pero no restringirlo al mínimo. Desde el Ministerio de Transporte indicaron que el retiro del reglamento se trata de una acción regular para realizar un proceso de observaciones y comentarios a los documentos, los cuales luego son retirados para responder los requerimientos del organismo y así volver a ser ingresados. Críticas a la “Ley Uber” Cabe destacar que una de las normas polémicas de la normativa es que exigirá que los vehículos tengan una cilindrada mínima de 1.400 centímetros cúbicos. Es decir, que los modelos como el Suzuki Baleno, el Toyota Raize y el Kia Morning, no podrán ser utilizados para trabajar en las aplicaciones. Además, tampoco se permitiría utilizar automóviles de más de diez años de antigüedad y se exigiría licencia de conducir profesional. Situación que causaría que miles de conductores queden inhabilitados.",

    "title": "Man Nearly Dies from Vitamin D Overdose Caused by Misinformation",
    "text": "A 48-year-old middle-aged man surnamed Zhang has an alcoholic habit. Not only does he suffer from alcoholic cirrhosis, he even had to have bilateral artificial hip joints replaced due to osteoporosis and femoral head necrosis. However, he mistakenly heard a friend tell him, “Supplementing more vitamin D can help.” “To preserve bones”, I actually swallowed 2-3 pills a day. As a result, I developed symptoms of “hypercalcemia” and my kidney function was only 30 points. After emergency medical treatment, I quickly stopped taking the medicine and drank a lot of fluids, and finally returned to normal values.\nChen Zhengguo, an attending physician at the Department of Hepatobiliary and Gastroenterology at Ajou University Hospital, said that because the patient was engaged in a heavy job, he would invite his friends to have two drinks after work. Over time, this accumulated and developed symptoms of alcoholic cirrhosis, which also caused osteoporosis and femoral head ischemia. Due to sexual necrosis, not only was he unable to stand for long periods of time, but it was even very painful to walk. His condition improved slightly after the replacement of an artificial hip joint, so he kept asking how to “preserve his bones.”\nUnexpectedly, a friend told the patient: “Supplementing more vitamin D can preserve bones and even prevent osteoporosis.” After hearing this, he was greatly moved, so he went to the pharmacy to buy vitamin\nhealth food. The original recommended dosage was 1 tablet per day. , but he took 2-3 tablets a day. After more than 2 months, he began to experience symptoms such as constipation, drowsiness, frequent urination, and thirst. Recently, he was found unconscious lying in the living room by his family, and he suddenly realized that something was wrong. Send him to a doctor immediately for examination.\nChen Zhengguo pointed out that after a blood test, it was found that calcium ions in the blood were as high as 14.5 mg/dl, parathyroid hormone was 3.3 pg/ml, and the renal function score directly deteriorated from more than 80 points to more than 20 points. After questioning, it was discovered that it was due to active I overdosed on vitamin D3, so I stopped taking it urgently and replenished a lot of fluids before I finally regained consciousness. I went back to the doctor a week later and the values returned to normal smoothly.\nLin Xuanren, attending physician at the Department of Nephrology and Director of the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit of Asia University Hospital, pointed out that vitamin D3 is divided into “active” and “inactive”. If we use the metaphor of a factory, inactive vitamin D3 (or nutritional vitamin D3) is like a raw material. After being processed in the factory (i.e. metabolized by the liver and kidneys), it becomes active vitamin D3, which can act on bones, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys to help bone osteogenesis and increase blood calcium concentration.\nTherefore, Lin Xuanren suggested that people should supplement with “inactive” vitamin D3. This concept is like the purchase of raw materials in large quantities. The factory will automatically adjust the product quantity so that the active vitamin D3 will not increase endlessly and will not cause calcium and phosphorus damage. If it is unbalanced, it is relatively harmless to the human body when taken too much. However, if “active” vitamin D3 is taken directly, the body will not be able to adjust. Especially when the dosage of active vitamin D3 exceeds the standard, it will often directly cause fatal hypercalcemia. Therefore, Vitamin D3 will only be used for medical purposes, such as in patients with acute hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism.\nChen Zhengguo and Lin Xuanren reminded that although vitamin D3 can help with osteoporosis, long-term excessive intake can also cause harm. People may wish to consume an appropriate amount of inactive vitamin D3 through sun exposure, diet, etc., in case of high blood pressure. If you have symptoms of calcium, you must seek medical advice as soon as possible to find out the underlying cause, so that you can completely cure and prevent hypercalcemia.\nReal estate related\nnews\n2023-12-28 22:01:28\n#greedy #man #swallowed #\nhealth #food #poisoned #vitamin #Doctor #Beware #kidney #damage #Good # news #Taiwan #TaiwanHot",

    "title": "Why Did Pentagon Allow Turkish Muslim Citizen Access to Highly Classified Docs?",
    "text": "“More than 150 pages of documents from a highly classified network.”\n90% of classified document cases now involve easily and entirely preventable situations where people who should not have had access to them, got access to them because it was easier for contractors or government agencies to employ them.\nPeople ask how does the Iranian Pentagon Chief of Staff who worked with an enemy government get security clearance?\nBut the NSC, the DOD and various agencies are full of people that would not have been allowed within a hundred miles of a government facility twenty years ago.\nDual citizens used to be barred from accessing classified documents. These days, Chinese citizens get access to whatever they want and you can be a dual citizen of an Islamic terror state and everyone will be shocked when you act like a citizen of an enemy state .\nGokhan Gun, a 50-year-old Falls Church, Virginia, resident who holds a dual citizenship with Turkey, was arrested August 9 by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nGun is an electrical engineer who works in the Department of Defense Joint Warfare Analysis Center.\nEarlier in the week, they claim, Gun printed off 82 pages marked as top secret. FBI agents found a backpack “prepared for his foreign trip” in the DOD engineer’s dining room.\nThe backpack was allegedly found to contain even more classified materials.\nOfficials say that Gun printed off and took more than 150 pages of documents from a highly classified network.\nIn the past, he has taken over a dozen trips to international destinations in Europe and the Middle East.\nThere’s plenty to delve into here, but let’s start with why a dual citizen was employed in the DOD Joint Warfare Analysis Center, and why he was able to access “150 pages of documents from a highly classified network” after taking multiple trips to the Middle East.\nGokhan Gun, 50, of Falls Church, Virginia, was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and is a dual citizen of Turkey and the United States. Through his employment, Gun possesses a Top Secret security clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and has received training on the proper handling and storage of classified information.\nOf course it’s Falls Church. Having a giant Islamist community near the hub of our security and government operation is always a great idea.\nI remember when American Jews who visited Israel or even had relatives there were barred from Federal employment.\nHere, an actual foreign citizen, born in Turkey, who retained citizenship there, was given access to highly classified documents.\nPacked for travel in a small personal belt bag, Gun allegedly had his U.S. passport and an expired passport from Turkey.\nHe was traveling with a Turkish passport.\nI don’t even blame Gun here. He was being a Muslim patriot. Only an insane country whose leadership has lost its mind would have given him the kind of access that it did.",
