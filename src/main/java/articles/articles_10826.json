    "title": "States expand health insurance coverage for immigrants",
    "text": "A growing number of states are opening taxpayer-funded health insurance programs to immigrants, including those living in the U.S. without authorization, even as Republicans assail President Joe Biden over a dramatic increase in illegal crossings of the southern border. Eleven states and Washington, D.C., together provide full health insurance coverage to more than 1 million low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status, according to state data compiled by KFF Health News. Most aren’t authorized to live in the U.S., state officials say. Enrollment in these programs could nearly double by 2025 as at least seven states initiate or expand coverage. Starting this month, Republican-controlled Utah is covering children regardless of immigration status, while New York and California will widen eligibility to cover more adults. “These are kids, and we have a heart,” said Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who initially opposed his state’s plan to cover children lacking legal status but relented after compromises including a cap on enrollment. People are also reading… There are more than 10 million people living in the U.S. without authorization, according to estimates by the Pew Research Center. Immigrant advocates and academic experts point to two factors behind state leaders’ rising interest in providing health care to this population: The pandemic highlighted the importance of insurance coverage to control the spread of infectious diseases; and some states are focusing on people without legal status to further drive down the country’s record-low uninsured rate. States have also expanded coverage in response to pleas from hospitals, lawmakers say, to reduce the financial burden of treating uninsured patients. All states pay hospitals to provide emergency services to some unauthorized residents in emergency rooms, a program known as Emergency Medicaid. About a dozen states have extended coverage for only prenatal care for such people. Full state-provided health insurance coverage is much less common, but increasing. An estimated half of the people living in the U.S. without authorization are uninsured, according to a KFF-Los Angeles Times survey. That’s more than five times the uninsured rate for U.S. citizens. Immigrants lacking authorization are ineligible for federal health programs. But states can use their own money to provide coverage through Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for low-income people. California was the first state to begin covering immigrants regardless of their legal status, starting with children in 2016. “This is a real reflection of the conflict we have in the country and how states are realizing we cannot ignore immigrant communities simply because of their immigration status,” said Adriana Cadena, director of the advocacy group Protecting Immigrant Families. Many of the millions of people without permanent legal residency have been in the United States for decades and have no path to citizenship, she said. These state extensions of health coverage come against a backdrop of rising hostility toward migrants among Republicans. The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 1.5 million people in fiscal year 2023 after they crossed the southern border, a record. GOP presidential candidates have portrayed the border as in crisis under Biden, and dangers of illegal immigration, like increasing crime, as the nation’s top domestic concern. Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow specializing in immigration issues with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said states would regret expanding coverage to immigrants lacking permanent legal residency because of the cost. Illinois, he noted, recently paused enrollment in its program over financial concerns. “We need to share resources with people who contribute to society and not have people take benefits for those who have not contributed, as I don’t see how the math would work in the long run,” Hankinson said. “Otherwise, you create an incentive for people to come and get free stuff.” Most adults lacking authorization work, accounting for about 5% of the U.S. labor force, according to the Pew Research Center. The state with the most unauthorized residents with state-provided health insurance is California, which currently covers about 655,000 immigrants without regard for their legal status. This month, it is expanding coverage to people ages 26-49 regardless of their immigration status, benefiting an estimated 700,000 additional Californians. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, D.C., and Washington state also provide full coverage to some people living in the U.S. without authorization. New York and Washington state are expanding eligibility. Oregon, Colorado, and New Jersey in recent years began covering more than 100,000 people in total regardless of legal status. Minnesota will follow in 2025, covering an estimated 40,000 people. “The pandemic highlighted the need to have coverage for everybody,” said Ciriac Alvarez Valle, senior policy analyst for Voices for Utah Children, an advocacy group. “It will make a huge impact on the lives of these kids.”",

    "title": "Reynolds rejects Summer EBT for Iowa kids again, proposes new food aid program",
    "text": "By Katarina Sostaric ,\n19 days ago\nThe Food Bank of Iowa says it's serving about 150,000 individuals each month (Marco Verch / Flickr) Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is once again rejecting a federal summer food assistance program for kids that would provide $120 per child for groceries to food-insecure families next summer.\nShe announced Thursday that she is instead seeking funding from the federal government to provide three monthly boxes of food during the summer to families making up to 200% of the federal poverty level. The boxes would be picked up at distribution sites or delivered to families lacking transportation.\nReynolds said her proposal would feed more kids at a lower cost than the Summer EBT/SUN Bucks program, while promoting healthier foods.\n\"Last year, I invested $900,000 to expand two other USDA summer feeding programs operated by the Iowa Department of Education that provide healthy, balanced meals and snacks for school-age children statewide,” she said in a statement. \"Our plan for 2025 builds upon that concept to promote food security and better health for more Iowa children.”\nState officials estimate the program would reach about 300,000 children. Reynolds’ office did not immediately respond to questions Thursday about how much it would cost.\nSummer EBT, which most states chose to participate in this year, provides money for groceries to families with an income up to 185% of the federal poverty level. This summer, it would have sent an estimated $29 million in federal funding to more than 240,000 kids in Iowa for food assistance. The state of Iowa would have paid about $2.2 million to administer the program.\nLast year, when Reynolds decided to reject the program for this summer, she said COVID-era cash benefit programs are not sustainable and don’t promote nutrition \"when childhood obesity has become an epidemic.”\nThe state’s news release Thursday noted Iowa is ranked 18 th highest in the nation for childhood obesity.\n\"The complex issues of food insecurity and obesity cannot be solved with cash benefits that don’t actively promote health, nutrition-dense food or reach all Iowa children in need,” said Kelly Garcia, director of the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. \"In Iowa, our focus is on the comprehensive well-being of this generation of young Iowans. Our solutions to promote healthy behaviors and well-balanced, nutritious diets for children must be comprehensive and holistic.”\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Summer EBT is an evidence-based program that is helping 21 million children in dozens of states, territories and tribes.\n\"It is backed by a decade of demonstration projects and rigorous evaluation showing that it works to reduce child hunger and support healthier diets,\" the USDA spokesperson said in an email. \"It also provides families with the freedom to make their own decisions on what food is best for their unique needs. Through this waiver request, the governor is asserting that the state knows better than its own families do about what their needs are.\"\nThe spokesperson said the USDA stands ready to offer Summer EBT in more states, including Iowa.\nIowa Hunger Coalition Chair Luke Elzinga said while Reynolds' decision is not exactly what he hoped for, he is grateful state leaders are recognizing the high level of food insecurity.\n\"We appreciate the state’s willingness to explore alternative options, but we also remain steadfast in our belief that using Summer EBT to provide grocery benefits directly to families is the best decision for Iowa,” Elzinga said. \"The research is clear that when parents have more money available to purchase groceries, it allows them to make more nutritious choices for their children.”\nHe said grocery money also allows parents to make food choices that best fit their family’s dietary needs.\nElzinga said everyone who contacted state officials directly or signed a petition urging Reynolds to join Summer EBT should take pride in this decision.\nBut he said it has been a hard summer with food pantries facing a very high level of need.\n\"We’ve had food banks, food pantries and other emergency feeding organizations across the state facing record-breaking levels of need and just huge amounts of people turning to them for assistance,” Elzinga said.\nHe said those records will likely keep being broken into the fall and winter, with the holiday season typically being the busiest time for food pantries.\nWhen Reynolds rejected the $29 million in federal food aid for this summer, she put $900,000 into expanding summer meal sites that provide free meals to children. That funding led to the creation of 61 new meal sites across the state. Some existing sites closed, so there was a net increase of 21 meal sites this summer, from a total of 512 to 533.\nReynolds’ announcement indicated those sites would be involved in her new plan for monthly food boxes.\nElzinga also said it’s not clear if the USDA has the authority to grant the waiver because Reynolds’ proposal is not just a small change to the Summer EBT program, it’s something completely different.\nRep. Sami Scheetz, D-Cedar Rapids, said it’s \"tragic” that thousands of Iowa kids went without food assistance this summer because of Reynolds’ decision.\n\"While we strongly disagree with the governor’s decision to yet again reject federal funding to feed 245,000 Iowa kids next summer, we will try to work with the governor to make sure no kid goes hungry,” Scheetz said. \"It’s not complicated: drop the politics and feed hungry kids.”\nThis story was updated to include comment from the USDA.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "2023-12-28 23:20:00 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discusses “peace formula” with Pope Francis Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently took to his former Twitter account to announce that he had a conversation with Pope Francis about Ukraine’s “peace formula.” During their discussion, Zelensky mentioned that representatives of over 80 countries are already involved in the process and more will be joining soon. In addition to discussing the peace formula, Zelensky expressed his gratitude to the Pope for his Christmas greetings to Ukraine and its citizens. Zelensky also thanked the Pope for his “blessings and wishes for peace for all of us,” and expressed his appreciation for the Vatican’s support of Ukraine’s efforts. The conversation between Zelensky and Pope Francis comes at a crucial time for Ukraine as the country continues to navigate its relationship with neighboring Russia and strives for peace within its borders. The involvement of over 80 countries in Ukraine’s peace formula process signals international support for the country’s efforts, and the additional support from the Vatican further strengthens Ukraine’s position on the global stage. As the situation in Ukraine continues to develop, Zelensky’s discussion with Pope Francis highlights the importance of diplomatic relations and international cooperation in achieving peace and stability in the region. #Zelensky #discussed #Pope #peace #formula #Ukraine",

Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n\"The task here is to dismantle Hamas - so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,\" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. \"We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.\"\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n\"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel's latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nStory continues Reuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1% of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip's dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT'S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt \"to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,\" Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "La Selección Peruana ultima detalles para su enfrentamiento contra Bolivia por la fecha 13 de las Eliminatorias Sudamericanas.\nA un día del partido ante Bolivia por las Eliminatorias Sudamericanas, los jugadores de la Selección Peruana recibieron el cariño de decenas de trabajadores de la nueva Casa de la Bicolor, quienes cumplieron el sueño de estar cerca de sus ídolos.\n\"Cada día te quiero más\" y \"Perú, Perú\", fueron algunos de los cánticos de los hinchas en las instalaciones de la Videna, que contará con un nuevo y moderno espacio de trabajo.\nGianluca Lapadula, Pedro Gallese, André Carrillo y especialmente Paolo Guerrero fueron los más aclamados. E incluso el atacante de Alianza Lima se tomó una foto con una de las aficionadas.\nHay que indicar, que el entrenador Óscar Ibáñez repitió el sistema 1-4-3-3 como su once titular, pero utilizó a Miguel Trauco en el puesto de lateral izquierdo por Marcos López. En el ataque, volvió a alternar a Paolo Guerrero, que fue inicialista, y que posteriormente cedió su lugar a Gianluca Lapadula.\nÓscar Ibáñez sobre la cancha del Estadio Nacional\n“Pensábamos que el campo de juego estaba en mejores condiciones. Ayer nos movimos un poco y no está en su mejor forma, por decir lo menos”, manifestó el entrenador Óscar Ibáñez respecto al estado del gramado del Estadio Nacional, donde se jugará el enfrentamiento ante Bolivia.\nIbáñez aclaró que ambas selecciones tendrán que adaptarse a dichas condiciones. “Pero bueno, es una situación que se presenta para ambos equipos, hubiéramos querido tener otro campo, lamentablemente ya está, ya no llega. Evitaremos hoy ir a pisarlo nuevamente para que pueda estar en mejores condiciones el día del partido”.\n¿Cuándo y dónde juegan Perú vs Bolivia en vivo por las Eliminatorias 2026?\nEl partido Perú vs Bolivia por la fecha 13 de las Eliminatorias Sudamericanas se disputará el jueves 20 de marzo en el Estadio Nacional de Lima.
