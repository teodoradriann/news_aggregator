    "text": "Event Highlights Joint Venture’s Role in Global Adoption of HPDI™ Fuel System,\nAdvancing Commercial Transportation to Smarter, Cleaner Power with IC Engines\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Volvo Group (“Volvo”) and Westport Fuel Systems Inc. (\"Westport\" or the “Company”) (TSX: WPRT / Nasdaq: WPRT ) today marked a defining moment in the journey of the newly formed joint venture (JV) as the two companies celebrated the official launch of their partnership with an exclusive event at the University of British Columbia, the birthplace of Westport's HPDI™ fuel system technology.\nNurtured for nearly 30 years within Westport, the two partners are coming together to jointly promote, develop and further accelerate the commercialization of the HPDI technology. In doing so, the JV will resolutely focus on moving forward affordable, sustainable transportation solutions using the internal combustion engine operating on renewable fuels now and hydrogen in the future.\n“This joint venture is poised to make a significant impact on global long-haul and off-road heavy-duty applications,” said Dan Sceli, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Westport Fuel Systems, and interim President of the Volvo/Westport JV. “By combining Volvo’s extensive expertise in commercial vehicle and power system manufacturing with Westport’s innovative fuel system technology, we are creating a powerful force for change that can make a meaningful contribution to reduce carbon emissions immediately and affordably. Together we are committed to delivering sustainable, efficient, and economically viable solutions for long-haul transportation.”\nPartnership is the New Leadership\nLeaders from both companies joined-in on the celebration of this milestone, emphasizing the significance of the partnership in driving forward HPDI’s breakthrough technology in tackling the urgent challenges of climate change.\n“Today is a day of celebration as we join together to collectively advance this critically important clean transportation initiative,” said Lars Stenqvist, Chief Technology Officer of Volvo Group. “We believe HPDI-powered internal combustion engines, running on hydrogen and renewable fuels, play a crucial role in global decarbonization efforts in commercial transportation. The joint venture enables us to combine this innovative fuel system with our strategic expertise to guide OEMs and fleets as they navigate the energy transition.”\n“This is a momentous occasion for Westport and the HPDI technology. The alliance between our two companies affirms our steadfast commitment to drive decarbonization in the heavy-duty sector utilizing alternative fuels while still providing the efficiency, power and durability that comes with diesel cycle engines,” said Scott Baker, Vice President, Product Development and Technology Officer of the Volvo/Westport JV.\nBaker continued, “Together, we will provide unparalleled expertise and counsel to customers around the globe on optimizing their existing CO 2 reduction strategies, ultimately paving the way for a more sustainable future in heavy-duty transportation.”\nCollaboration with transportation partners and end-users has led to the deployment of the HPDI system in thousands of Volvo trucks across Europe, underscoring its effectiveness in achieving carbon neutrality. Since the commercial release of HPDI in 2018, fleets have collectively avoided hundreds of thousands of tons of CO 2 emissions annually. This success demonstrates the immediate impact of integrating hydrogen and biogas technologies into existing infrastructure.\nAt the heart of the HPDI ™ Fuel System is a revolutionary patented injector with a dual concentric needle design that delivers small quantities of diesel fuel and large quantities of natural gas, at high pressure, to the combustion chamber. The natural gas is injected at the end of the compression stroke. Launched in 2024, the Volvo FH Aero gas-powered is a long-haul truck shaped for aerodynamic efficiency.\nIMAGE: VOLVO TRUCKS\nAbout Westport Fuel Systems\nAt Westport, we are driving innovation to power a cleaner tomorrow.

Cofrades de las hermandades de la ciudad y asociaciones religiosas también han estado presentes la misa.\nSonaban las campanas de la Catedral y minutos más tarde de la hora prevista comenzaba el Solemne Pontifical con la entrada al templo desde la sacristía del obispo, Rafael Zornoza, y los demás sacerdotes que le han acompañado en la celebración.\nLa espléndida Custodia gaditana lucía en la Catedral exornada con rosas rojas. Allí también se encontraba la Virgen del Rosario, Patrona de Cádiz con distintas flores en tonos rosas y blanco. Además estaban sobre sus andas preparados para la procesión las imágenes del beato Diego José de Cádiz, el Niño Jesús de Santo Domingo y los santos patronos San Servando y San Germán.\nEn su homilía Rafael Zornoza incidía en la importancia de esta festividad. «Estamos aquí para celebrar esta fiesta con gozo. Es una fiesta que nos obliga a saborear mejor las verdades de la fe y la redencion del Señor Jesús. Repetiremos esas palabras de cuando el Señor instituyó la Eucaristía, estas palabras que escuchamos con atención tienen mucha mas importancia de lo que pensamos se podría decir que es el epicentro de este terremoto en el que Dios entra en el mundo porque ahí se culmina ese plan que está en el corazón del Señor que ha hecho todo por venir a nosotros».\nDestacaba el prelado gaditano en el sentido de la Eucaristía con palabras de Santo Tomas de Aquino. «Decía que en el misterio de la Eucaristía se contienen todas las riquezas que Dios ha querido dar al mundo. El pan que nos une es signo de nuestra comunidad. El Señor llama a la unidad en la fe, esperanza, caridad y amor». También ha querido Zornoza agradecer la labor de todos los que hacen posible esta procesión en esta jornada. «Os agradezco el esfuerzo, los preparativos, a los sacerdotes, a las parroquias... Muchas gracias por estar aquí porque vuestra presencia será un signo de ese deseo de caminar juntos que Dios tiene para nosotros para buscar el bien de todos. La procesión es una costumbre Cristiana. Nos permite aceptar la presencia de Dios en el mundo, en un mundo que se seculariza, que quiere vivir como si Dios no existiera. Se hace presente entre nosotros en nuestro mundo, nuestras calles... queriendo visitar a todos y socorrer sobre todo a los desvalidos, a los que están solos o los sin techo».\nTras la comunión se formaba el amplio cortejo de la procesión que empezaba a salir por la puerta principal de la Catedral. Abría camino la banda Ecce Mater de Cádiz y detrás, la cruz de guía cedida por la hermandad de Afligidos y los niños de Primera Comunión, los fieles, asociaciones de colegios católicos y las hermandades. Tras las imágenes del Niño Jesús, el beato Diego y los patronos iba la Alcaldesa Perpetua de Cádiz. La cuadrilla de cargadores de la archicofradía del Rosario elevaba el paso de la Patrona dentro de Catedral y caminaba hacia la salida. Mientras, dentro, bajo el palio de respeto llegaba el Santísimo Sacramento a la Custodia y era canónigo Guillermo Domínguez Leonsegui quien lo entronizaba en esa custodia del Cogollo que va dentro de la de plata.\nBajaba por la rampa dispuesta para este Corpus en Catedral el paso de la Patrona y sonaba la marcha Pasan los Campanilleros de López Farfán interpretada por la banda Maestro Dueñas de El Puerto. Unos minutos despúes con el persistente viento de levante sonaban de nuevo las campanas del primer templo de la diócesis y salía la Custodia con Jesús Sacramentado para llegar a todos los gaditanos. Se escuchaba entonces la marcha Corpus Christi que tocaba la banda de Música Cruz Roja ACM Maestro Agripino Lozano. José Julio Reyeros dirigía una vez más el carro de la Custodia flanqueado por sacerdotes. Detrás del Santísimo Sacramento, además de la curia, iba la corporación municipal con el alcalde, Bruno García, como máximo representante, y autoridades militares y civiles.\nLa procesión seguía el recorrido previsto, más arropada de público conforme avanzaba la mañana y se encaraban calles algo más protegidas del viento. Tras superar la Plaza de san Agustín llegaba hasta San Juan de Dios engalanada con mimo y donde se encontraba la alfombra de arena tintada que resistía a pesar del levante. Allí también se encontraba el altar que por primera vez había montado la hermandad del Rocío de Cádiz y que, junto a los demás altares preparados este año ensalzaban la fiesta.\nPasada la una de la tarde ya llegaba de nuevo el Santísimo Sacramento a la Catedral y repicaban las campanas. Allí el obispo procedía a la bendición final. Tras ello regresaban a su templo las imágenes para terminar esta jornada de un Corpus en Cádiz que ha ganado en solemnidad.",

    "text": "Pistorius: Ukraine is just the beginning for Putin, Russia is arming for more than \"just a war with Ukraine\" German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warned today that Russia is rapidly arming itself for more than the war in Ukraine, writes DPA. \"We see that Russia is rapidly increasing its weapons production and dramatically strengthening its armed forces. All this removes the doubt: for Russia, for Vladimir Putin's Russia, Ukraine is just the beginning,\" Pistorius said in Vilnius. He emphasized that the German Bundeswehr is ready \"to become the central pillar of conventional deterrence and defense in Europe.\" In this context, he emphasized the role of Germany as a center for the rapid transfer of NATO forces from the Atlantic to the eastern flank. Under the agreement with Lithuania, the German government permanently stationed a combat and autonomous brigade of the Bundeswehr in that country. That unit should be operational by 2027. The formation of the brigade is a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and reflects the changed picture of security in Europe. The German brigade will have up to 5.000 soldiers. Initially, they will be temporarily located at the Lithuanian barracks near Vilnius, and then at their own bases in Rudnikaya and Rukla, about thirty kilometers south and eighty kilometers northwest of Vilnius.",
