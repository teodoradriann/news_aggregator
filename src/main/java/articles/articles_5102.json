    "text": "At the School of Public Policy, students can step directly into the world of defense strategy. Through a collaboration with the Department of Defense (DoD), they are tackling critical issues and gaining hands-on experience in policy analysis on issues related to national security.\nLast spring, eight students in the PLCY690/790 project course—including five from the section taught by Research Professor and CISSM Research Director David Backer—developed research projects through a partnership with the DoD. These opportunities highlight the role that emerging policy professionals play in advancing national defense objectives. This emphasizes the School’s role in bridging academia and government to address pressing global challenges.\nStudents undertook these projects on topics ranging from European deterrence to supply chain security, working closely with DoD subject matter experts to refine project scopes, gather feedback and present findings at the Pentagon. This experience, designed to enhance the practical application of policy education, prepared SPP graduates to step into impactful national defense roles. One student is now working within the DoD, while another has joined the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. A third graduate has taken on a position with the Department of the Navy after an independent DoD project.\nBeyond the DoD Initiative, Backer has also served as faculty mentor for three projects in the Research for Intelligence and Security Challenges (RISC) program operated by UMD's Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security. The RISC program pairs teams of student interns with DoD clients to solve complex defense issues. Recent collaborations that Backer has mentored have included projects for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology Program Protection.\nAs the DoD Initiative continues this academic year, SPP students are once again gaining valuable insights into national defense and security. Seven students have already been matched with DoD clients, including five of Backer’s current students.",

    "text": "Vail Mountain and Beaver Creek Resort will re-announce their $450,000 EpicPromise grant to the Vail Valley Foundation during Friday’s Birds of Prey World Cup downhill. The check presentation will take place following the national anthem at 10:30 a.m. at the Red Tail Stadium in Beaver Creek.\nOriginally presented last year, the funding is designated to help address the critical child care shortage in the Eagle River Valley as the Vail Valley Foundation works to expand early childhood education opportunities. The foundation recently signed a pre-construction agreement with RA Nelson, a respected local construction company, to build a new child care facility in Avon , and is currently reviewing proposals for a facility operator.\nOnce completed, the 13,450-square-foot early childhood education and development center will provide approximately 165 spots for children ages 0-5 . The project is expected to break ground by May 2025, with the facility becoming operational by fall 2026. Some of the $450,000 grant also supports afterschool and summer programs for Eagle County youth through YouthPower365, another Vail Valley Foundation program.\nLearn more about EpicPromise at EpicPromise.com , learn more about the Vail Valley Foundation at VVF.org and learn more about YouthPower365 at YouthPower365.org .",
