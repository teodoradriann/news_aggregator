    "text": "Opinion SUBSCRIBER ONLY Opinion | Your View: Trump’s behavior doesn’t align with Ten Commandments Town Square Cartoons By Ann Lowy | alowy@mcall.com | The Morning Call December 24, 2023 at 10:30 a.m. Trump’s behavior doesn’t align with Ten Commandments To all those Christians who think Donald Trump is their savior, please note the Ten Commandments. Number one: Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor, thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s wife, or his goods. These are a few issues with Donald Trump as leader. He has said he alone can save us and get retribution; God said vengeance is mine, I will repay. Can he shoot someone in Times Square and not lose a vote, can he commit adultery as often as he wants, even when his wife is home with a baby? Has he not lied when he called Mike Pence a traitor? Please, people, wake up and see the evil and deception in this man. Don’t vote for him because he is against abortion. He is against all that most people with a conscience believe. Let’s keep religion and politics separate. Think and vote for the best person to help this country to be whole again. Don’t vote for someone who betrays his friends for his own benefit and profit.\nPalma Moyer\nRichland Township\nHeritage Foundation provides propaganda, not facts I have a simple, but lengthy question: Why does The Morning Call continue to print right-wing propaganda generated by the Heritage Foundation, a known Republican think tank that, among other things, helped write the Project 2025 document? That’s the “presidential transition project” that provides a clear and detailed outline of how to create a Republican administration in the United States that will subjugate democratic thought and pave the way for a long-term authoritarian government under Donald Trump and his successors. I grow tired of these attempts to be duped into believing what the Heritage Foundation claims are facts, when in reality are nothing but prejudicial claims aimed at toppling the Biden administration.\nDennis Scholl\nHellertown\nFellow diner’s kindness left lasting impression On entering the Hanover Eatery alone, I encountered a stranger, Mary, with whom I shared a unique story. Mary invited me to join her and her friend for breakfast. I was very grateful for her kind invitation and explained that I was expecting my friend Anne at any time.\nToward the end of our meal, Mary came by to wish us a Merry Christmas, which was so thoughtful and, of course, was reciprocated, and then she left.\nWhen waiting for our bill, our waitress came over to tell us it had been paid by Mary. We were so absolutely and pleasantly surprised, to say the least, by such a kindly, gratuitous act. Perhaps we may not meet Mary ever again, but will remember being overwhelmed by her spirit of kindness and generosity. Thank you and God bless, Mary.\nKathy Rich\nBethlehem\nGOP wrong on impeachment, funding for Ukraine The Day One Dictator has issued his orders and as a result the obsequious Republicans in the House of Representatives have voted unanimously to launch an investigation into whether there is any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of President Biden that would rise to the level of warranting impeachment. Undoubtedly tens and tens of millions of taxpayers’ dollars will be spent on this fishing expedition, while in the meantime no additional funding will be forthcoming to prevent Putin from defeating and then annexing Ukraine. My heart goes out to the Ukrainians who are about to experience the full impact of a seasoned dictator’s plan of expansion at the expense of the fledgling democracy that is Ukraine.\nJames McMahan\nLower Macungie Township\nHoliday Pops show featured impressive performances On Dec. 16, my family and I enjoyed two hours of outstanding holiday entertainment. We were in attendance for the annual Holiday Pops presented by Miller Symphony Hall. The Allentown Symphony Orchestra was amazing as always. Additional performances were equally impressive. Dancers from Accent School of Dance and the O’Grady Quinlan Academy of Irish Dance performed flawlessly. An additional highlight was the inspiring voices of the Emmaus High School Chorale; what a talented group of young people! Thank you to all the participants and all those connected to this wonderful holiday event; a perfect way to enjoy the holiday season. Merry Christmas!\nPatricia Smull\nEaston\nPennDOT signs don’t help drivers protect road workers Will someone at PennDot please explain why: (1) There are so many “work zones” where nobody is working or likely to be working for weeks; (2) why the flashing signal telling drivers if the work zone is active and requires slowing down is placed toward the middle or the end, not the beginning, of the work zone; and (3) why work zone signs remain in place seemingly forever, well after the work is done. Drivers want to protect workers, but when the signage bears no relationship to the actual work situation, they get frustrated — and ignore the 55 mph limits.\nJack Johannes\nAllentown\nPeace Pilgrimage made more difficult by current events For me, the Peace Pilgrimage of 2023 was more challenging than ever, and not just because of my age. It was harder to balance and stay focused on the path ahead, especially with two wars raging, and weapons needed for both.\nShould we step forward with aid for Ukraine, arm Israel to fight with Hamas or stand aside? How can we ignore the suffering of the innocent people whose lives are in ruins? How can we stop the killing and find our way out of the labyrinth of endless wars?\nIt is not easy to continue walking from Nazareth to Bethlehem when real people in another Bethlehem and Nazareth face fear and hatred every day. It is hard, knowing how long the people of Ukraine have been suffering. It is not easy to walk knowing even the children have no safe places. Should we keep walking? Should we keep arming? Can we find a way to force the raging wars to stop without using force?\nThis December we joined many first-time pilgrims, stubbornly walking, hoping for the impossible, hoping to find the road to peace. Maybe, what we really need is for everyone, everywhere to join us.\nDebra Orben\nSpringfield Township\nThe Morning Call encourages community dialogue on important issues.

Muhammad Srour foi morto em Beirute , capital do Líbano , nesta quinta-feira (26).\n✅ Clique aqui para seguir o canal de notícias internacionais do g1 no WhatsApp\nA informação da morte de Srour foi confirmada pelo Hezbollah e pelas Forças de Defesa de Israel (FDI).\nSegundo os israelenses, Srour planejou e comandou diversos ataques terroristas aéreos, incluindo ataques com drones, mísseis de cruzeiro e veículos aéreos não tripulados (VANTs) direcionados contra a população de Israel.\nNos últimos anos, o membro do Hezbollah teria liderado o projeto da fabricação de VANTs no sul do Líbano, estabelecendo locais de fabricação próximos a infraestruturas civis em Beirute e em áreas do sul do Líbano.\nSegundo a FDI, Srour integrou o Hezbollah na década de 1980 e ocupou diversos cargos dentro do grupo extremista, incluindo comandante da unidade de mísseis, comandante da Unidade \"Aziz\" da Força Radwan, bem como emissário do Hezbollah no Iêmen e no Comando Aéreo do regime terrorista Houthi.\nA morte de Muhammad Srour é mais um dos comandantes do Hezbollah mortos por Israel nos últimos dias. Ainda nesta semana, os israelenses mataram o comandante da divisão de mísseis e foguetes.\nA Força Aérea de Israel tem realizado \"extensos ataques\" contra alvos do grupo extremista no sul do Líbano, em uma escalada no conflito entre israelenses e o Hezbollah nos últimos dias. (Leia mais abaixo)\nLEIA TAMBÉM:\nIsrael 'não deseja' invadir o território do Líbano, diz embaixador israelense na ONU Rússia prepara ataque contra instalações nucleares e deve ser 'forçada' a fazer paz, diz Zelensky\nIsrael x Hezbollah\nIsrael afirmou que está conduzindo uma operação militar na fronteira com o Líbano para que moradores da região possam voltar para casa. Esses israelenses deixaram a área por causa de ataques do grupo extremista Hezbollah, que atua no Líbano.\nHezbollah e Israel possuem um histórico de desavenças, que já resultou em uma guerra em 2006. O conflito na região voltou a se intensificar em outubro de 2023. À época, o grupo terrorista Hamas invadiu Israel, o que resultou na morte e sequestro de civis.\nEm resposta, Israel declarou guerra contra o Hamas e bombardeou a Faixa de Gaza. Desde então, o Hezbollah vem lançando foguetes contra Israel para demonstrar apoio ao grupo terrorista e aos moradores de Gaza.\nNa semana passada, pagers e walkie-talkies usados por membros do Hezbollah explodiram em uma ação coordenada. Em seguida, Israel anunciou que estava movendo tropas para a região de fronteira com o Líbano.\nIsrael também lançou uma série de bombardeios contra o Líbano, justificando que estava atacando estruturas do Hezbollah.\nDiante disso, a ONU levantou preocupações sobre uma guerra total no Oriente Médio.\n\"O Líbano está à beira do precipício. O povo do Líbano, o povo de Israel e o povo do mundo não podem permitir que o Líbano se torne outra Gaza\", disse o Secretário-Geral da ONU, António Guterres.\nVÍDEOS: mais assistidos do g1\n50 vídeos",

    "text": "A friend of mine, who wishes to remain anonymous, (so I will call him George), phoned me this evening to tell me what happened to him with Facebook. He is a Christian, and years ago, he moved from an Arab country to the United States to have a life of greater freedom. He speaks and reads both English and Arabic fluently. He has a “friend” on Facebook who is a Physician in Saudi Arabia, Mahmoud Al Araby.\nMahmoud would post on Facebook daily with posts in Arabic that were inciting violence against Israel and the IDF, such as:\n“Here is the news today! Your heroes (Hamas terrorists) killed 10 IDF soldiers today!” and\n“The media is lying. We are making headway in Gaza! We are winning the war against the IDF!”\n“Today 20 IDF soldiers were trapped in one of the Gaza tunnels. Our heroes came out of nowhere and shot and killed them! Allah Akbar!”\nSo, my friend, George, who reads Arabic, reported this abusive content to Facebook, complaining to them that this person is\npromoting violence and incitement on the Facebook platform. This is a clear violation of their Community Standards. Certainly, we can all agree that Hamas is a dangerous terrorist organization, right? You would think that this is a clear violation of Community Standards on Facebook, right?\nNot so! After doing a review of George’s complaint, Facebook came back to him and told him that Mahmoud Al Araby’s posts were within Facebook Community standards.\nGeorge continued to see the hateful posts against Israel, the Jews, and the IDF in the Gaza war and so he resent his complaint and asked for a second review of Mahmoud’s posts.\nThree days later, Facebook came back and DISABLED George’s account! Permanently!\nGeorge had been on Facebook for over 20 years and had always been in good standing with them. He was in the middle of a travel trip when his account was disabled and he was cut off from his FB messenger travel group. They had been sending him maps and info for his trip.\nHe cannot sign on. There is absolutely NO RECOURSE. There is no appeal process. There is NO phone number to call. He tried reaching out to and there has been no reply.\nHe tried reaching out to a specialty help desk outside of Facebook, and the technician told him that this happens to LOTS of people, and when your account is disabled, you have NO RECOURSE.\nIsaiah 5:20 talks about a day when good is called evil and evil is called good. Truly, we are living in those days now!\nSo, the pro-Hamas terrorist doctor in Saudi Arabia still has an active Facebook account, and my friend, George, a Christian, who, in good faith, was trying to report Mahmoud for inciting violence and terrorism is now KICKED OFF Facebook!\nFolks, it’s time to BOYCOTT Facebook! PERMANENTLY!\nLife is BETTER without Facebook!\nPreviously published by\nBridge Connector Ministries",

Voters have soundly rejected its conservative views on [abortion](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/#:~:text=While%20public%20support%20for%20legal,in%20all%20or%20most%20cases.) and [marriage equality](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx#:~:text=The%20data%20are%20presented%20in,and%205%25%20throughout%20the%20years.). Beholden to lobbyists from the gun industry, Republican politicians have [rejected common-sense gun control proposals](https://medium.com/discourse/guns-dont-kill-people-bullets-do-b86a1528e432?sk=c24c688c8f3600ba1e7fb5cecdd09348) that enjoy [widespread, bipartisan support](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/07/25/poll-majority--support-universal-background-checks-gun-licensing-assault-weapons-ban). While Republican politicians continue to deny that man-made climate change is an issue, \" [two-thirds of Americans prioritize developing alternative energy sources, like wind and solar.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/)\" The party advocates repealing Obamacare even though [62% of Americans view the Affordable Care Act favorably](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/poll-finding/5-charts-about-public-opinion-on-the-affordable-care-act/). Instead of using these losses as an opportunity to course correct, the Republican party has doubled down on its unpopular platform resulting in its slow and painful death. The Republican candidate has lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections. In the years since Bill Clinton defeated the older Bush to deny him a second term, only the younger Bush has been able to win more votes than the Democrat. While securing the majority in his reelection attempt, The Shrub only secured his first term when the Supreme Court handed him the Presidency with a ruling so partisan that the justices declared it could not be used as precedent by future courts. Trump had fewer votes than Hilary Clinton but won in the antiquated Electoral College, a feat that he was unable to repeat in 2020. Frustrated by this string of losses the party has increasingly turned towards violence. The last election cycle concluded with an attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021, which resulted in [$2.7 million of damage to the Capitol Building](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/24-months-january-6-attack-capitol), 174 injured police officers, and the [deaths of four of their fellow protestors](https://medium.com/discourse/justice-for-ashli-babbitt-8fc6636e10da?sk=53b36b4d9b106c25ddfe7cd118c66f3b). Instead of condemning this assault on democracy, Trump has referred to its participants as patriots. The defeated former President calls those convicted for their roles in the violent attempt to overturn an election \"hostages\" and promises to use his pardon power to free them if he is returned to the White House. In his third attempt to secure the presidency, Trump has continued to engage in rhetoric that threatens to inject violence into the democratic process. Not only has he continued to spread false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, but he regularly tells his followers that the only legitimate outcome for this year's election is one in which he is the victor.

    "text": "La Feria de Cali es uno de los eventos más esperados a final de año por el nivel de programas que se desarrollan durante la última semana de diciembre y a la que llegan miles de turistas nacionales y extranjeros, pero la inseguridad unida a la presencia de ladrones también son factores que se presentan en ella.En esta ocasión, la Policía Metropolitana de Cali capturó a cuatro personas que, al aparecer, estarían robando celulares de quienes llegan a la feria para disfrutar de la temporada. “Cuatro hombres, quienes al parecer estarían hurtando celulares en los eventos de la Feria de Cali, fueron capturados por unidades del Modelo Nacional de Vigilancia Comunitaria por Cuadrantes en el barrio el Lido, sur de la capital vallecaucana”, señaló la Policía. Según la información recolectada por las autoridades estos sujetos llegaron desde la costa Caribe para hacer de las suyas en Cali durante la temporada de feria y decembrina. La captura se dio por la llamada de una ciudadana y la Policía pudo dar con los delincuentes que se movilizaban en un vehículo. “Ante el reporte de un posible hurto, la Policía activó los protocolos de búsqueda contando con las características de los presuntos delincuentes y del vehículo en el que se movilizaban”, indicó la Policía. En el momento de la requisa les hallaron 35 celulares que habrían sido hurtados a las personas bajo la modalidad de cosquilleo. Los implicados cuentan con antecedentes por los delitos de hurto , por lo que fueron dejados a disposición de la Fiscalía General de la Nación y un Juez de Control de Garantías. Capturan en Cali a hombre que causó terror en centro comercial; esto fue lo que hizo La Policía Metropolitana de Santiago de Cali logró este jueves, 28 de diciembre, la captura de un hombre que causó verdadero terror en un centro comercial, ya que, intentó atacar a varios empleados con una arma blanca.Por la alteración al orden público, la Policía se acercó de forma rápida al centro comercial para tratar de solucionar la situación. Después de varios minutos, el hombre pudo ser reducido por las autoridades. La ciudadanía intentó lincharlo, pero fracasó en el intento.“La oportuna intervención de las unidades adscritas a la Estación de Policía La Flora permitió salvaguardar la vida e integridad de las mujeres. El implicado fue capturado y trasladado a un centro hospitalario donde permanece bajo custodia ”, agregó.De acuerdo con las personas afectadas en el centro comercial, en información recogida por El País de Cali , el hecho se presentó a las 10:00 a. m., hora colombiana. Muchas personas grabaron los momentos de terror que se vivieron en el centro comercial.“En un reconocido centro comercial ubicado en el norte de Cali, unidades del Modelo Nacional de Vigilancia Comunitaria por Cuadrantes capturaron en flagrancia a un hombre cuando intimidaba con un arma cortopunzante a tres trabajadoras de este establecimiento de comercio ”, señaló la Policía.“Lo que hace el tipo es que intenta esconderse en el Centro Comercial para evitar la turba que venía detrás persiguiéndolo y en el local hay un cerco de matas y se tira por encima del cerco e ingresa al negocio y arrincona a las empleadas; las tomó como rehenes durante aproximadamente cinco minutos”, dijo Carlos Gil, propietario de un restaurante al que el delincuente ingresó de forma violenta, en palabras recogidas por El País de Cali .",

    "text": "Yes, ‘Christ is King’ — that is bad news for antisemites We live in interesting times. Seems like no truth statement can stand on its own without being twisted into something nefarious. A recent trend on X (formerly known as Twitter) has been a useful case-in-point. The phrase “Christ is King” has been making waves over the last week. This statement has apparently become a dog whistle and a rallying cry for antisemites. For some bizarre reason, even self-professing Muslims like [Andrew Tate](https://twitter.com/Cobratate/status/1772221317019799930) and [SNEAKO](https://twitter.com/sneako/status/1772048489372880911), as well as notorious anti-Jewish activists like [Nick Fuentes](https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/articles/when-christ-and-trump-are-kings), have adopted this basic Christian truth not to really praise Jesus, but to spite Jewish people. On the face of it, proclaiming Jesus as Lord is one of the oldest confessions of faith of historic Christianity. Why wouldn’t we want Christ’s name proclaimed and exalted? Why shouldn’t this be a cause for rejoicing? Well, because it’s 2024, and anything and everything nowadays is used as pretense for stirring hatred and division — even the Lordship of Christ. And no amount of feigned sincerity on the part of these individuals can hide their true motivations. This is not an act of worship; it is bigotry masquerading as religious devotion. They can pretend all they want, “but the Lord looks on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7, ESV). This is ultimately bad news for anyone who knowingly harbors gratuitous hatred for Jewish people. Why? Because if Christ is an enemy of the Jews, He’s their enemy as well. 'To the Jew first…' The Apostle Paul writes: “For I am not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith” (Romans 1:16-17). Why isn’t Paul ashamed of this Gospel? Because there’s no greater promise than the one revealed in it. Through it, we are counted righteous and forgiven in the sight of the Almighty. Through it, we gain access to God’s presence. Through it, Paradise’s gates are flung open. This isn’t just “good news;” it’s the best news. And yet, Paul says that God’s plan of salvation starts with the Jewish people. In His sovereign decree, God chose to reveal His Word and Gospel through them. This fact can’t be overlooked. Even though God describes the Jews as “stiff-necked people” (Exodus 32:9; 33:3), He chooses them as His instrument and unworthy recipients of His grace. The Hebrew Bible records how time after time, despite Israel’s disobedience and sin, God continues to keep His promises to them. In Jeremiah we read, “Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings … and you shall be my people, and I will be your God” (Jeremiah 30:18; 22). God’s law is repeatedly broken, and God keeps blessing the lawbreakers. They deserve wrath, but they receive mercy. Why? Because of their outstanding moral uprightness? No. Because of His faithfulness and lovingkindness (Romans 3:34, Ezekiel 36:22). Now, this should give pause to people like Andrew Tate and Nick Fuentes. Anyone who truly understands grace should be humbled by all of this. It should cause self-reflection. These blessings were extended to the Jews by God’s divine mercy. And it is His mercy alone that keeps all of us from falling under God’s wrath. If anything, confessing Christ's Lordship should humble us; not drive us towards malice. At the end of the day, if Christ has cause to hate the Jews, He has equal cause to hate you too. It’s only His mercy that keeps you from falling. And by indulging in ethnic hatred, you’re merely storing up wrath for yourself. You can fool others, but you can't fool the omniscient Creator. Here is the good news God’s grace is extended to all nations; not just the Jews: “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples” (Isaiah 56:6-7). That’s the New Covenant promise, and God never breaks His promises. Through Christ, the “wall of hostility” between Jews and gentiles has been brought down (Ephesians 2:14). No one is excluded; everyone is invited — including repentant antisemites. Christ IS King! And one day everyone will bow and make that confession. Let’s pray that people like Nick Fuentes do so sincerely. There’s still time. Daniel Vaida is Assistant Opinion Editor at The Christian Post in Washington, D.C.",
