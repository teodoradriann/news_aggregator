    "title": "NFL Hall of Fame game between Texans, Bears cut short by extreme weather",
    "text": "By Tim Weaver ,\n1 hour ago\nHow do you make the longest preseason game of the year even longer? You call an extended delay due to extreme weather conditions with NFL officials seemingly unable to make a decision about whether or not to continue the game.\nIf that was on your bingo card you're in luck, because the Hall of Fame game between the Houston Texans and the Chicago Bears got stuck on pause with about three minutes left to go in the third quarter, which was about half an hour ago now.\nThe reason was severe thunderstorms in the area, including heavy rain and lightning. Here's a look from inside the press box.\nAfter waiting a long time, the league has finally made a decision and called the rest of the game off, per Jonathan Alexander at the Houston Chronicle.\nAnd so the Texans lose to the Bears by a score of 21-17. Chicago receiver Collin Johnson scored the winning touchdown early in the third quarter. Houston got strong performances from a few postiions, though - especially Davis Mills and Case Keenum at quarterback.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Fighting Marine: Jack Shipley recounts two combat tours in Vietnam\nThere’s a friendly rivalry between the military branches and it’s obvious to anyone that Marines harbor a deep pride. Now 82, Jack Shipley still proudly maintains his Marine background.\nAfter 2 Vietnam combat tours, the Purple Heart recipient liked the Marines well enough to build a career and retire as a Master Sergeant. A Marine Master Sergeant carries a lot of knowledge and experience which allows them a high level of authority. Troy Branch is a Sea Bee Vietnam vet with a spacious garage just right for his vet buddies to sit around and pass stories, and was where I met Jack Shipley.\nBorn in Jefferson City in 1941, Jack was the only child of Jack and June Brooks Shipley. Father Jack had served in the Navy during World War 2 and had returned home to support his family as a core driller. Jack recalled his boyhood Jefferson City days:\n“My dad had worked at Cherokee Dam and was a cook downtown before he went into the Navy. In the Navy he was a cook on an LST that did island hopping with the Sea Bees during the war,” he told. “I remember VE (Victory in Europe) Day. I spent my early days running the streets of Jefferson City. My great- grandfather was born in 1875 and remembered seeing Buffalo Bill. Me and Mama would go to the Jefferson City train depot and go to Knoxville where we’d often go to the WNOX radio studio to hear such stars as Roy Acuff and Archie Campbell before taking the train back home. I started school at the old Jefferson Elementary School at Sawmill Hollow, then went to the old junior high where the swimming pool is today.\n“When I was 13 we moved to Cedar City, Utah, where Dad had a job at exploratory drilling. Utah is a good place to raise a child. About a year and a half later we moved to Nogales, Arizona. It was in the ‘50s and there were a lot of old ranches around and I met a character who had fought the Apaches and who still wore 2 Colt pistols. He was bad news! They used to make Hollywood movies there and I got to watch them shoot scenes. A lot of my friends were extras in those movies and I saw Jean Simmons one time.\n“We stayed in Nogales about a year, then moved to Clifton, Arizona, where they were mining copper. I started high school in Clifton and as a freshman joined the Explorer Scouts. At my initiation, they threw me into a river. Rivers there were only about 8 inches deep and I fractured my ankle and broke the tibia and fibia in my leg. During the summer I got to work on a 3,000 acre cattle ranch for $1.00 a day and later got a job as a dishwasher in a Mexican restaurant that paid 75 cents an hour, which was much better.\n“We then moved to Bourbon, Missouri, where I spent my junior and senior years in high school and graduated in 1959. I had gone to the post office to join the Navy but no one was there. A Marine had come to our high school and I liked the uniform, so I joined the Marines. My basic training was at San Diego. It was serious but there was also some humor. You have to learn not to sweat the small stuff.”\nSixteen weeks of basic training was followed by an additional 4 weeks in Infantry training, where Jack was promoted to Private First Class. At the time, the basic Marine Infantry weapons were the heavy M-1s and BAR’s with the M-1s shifted to M-14s in 1961. Following his training, Jack was awarded an MOS as an engineer and was assigned to an amphibious assault fuel company, where some of their equipment included fuel buoys, Erie bulldozers and cranes. In 1960 he would be sent to Okinawa, Japan.\nAfter reenlisting, he came home before being sent to Long Beach, California, where his assignment was working in the post brig. He told of the philosophy in handling the prisoners. “We gave them little responsibilities and tried to send them back better than when they came in.” Now a sergeant, Jack was sent to Vietnam in 1966. Arriving at Chu Lai, he would find that they were top heavy with sergeants, and was asked where in Vietnam he wanted to go.\nHaving a buddy already in Vietnam, Jack asked to be stationed near his friend and was sent to the First Battalion of the 7th Marines. There a Sergeant Major sent him to Charlie Company where the company First Sergeant sent him to lead a squad on PF Hill with the mission of backing up the unit. One of Jack’s duties was to lead his squad on patrols. On one mission he was hit by 3 bullets at one time, with one bullet hitting his rifle handguard,another on his helmet, and the third on his pack, which spun him around.\nOn one occasion, he would be 1 kilometer from Cambodia and would endure a month of rain in 1966. He would describe another mission: “Another time my squad was to be used as a blocking force where we had to take along a 400 pound recoilless rifle on a 3 day mission. The weapon was heavy and our small squad also had to carry 20 rounds of ammunition for that gun. On the third night, we were ambushed and had 4 men wounded. We shot the ammo into a hill to keep from having to carry it back. In April ’67 we turned our sector over to the Army it was where Lieutenant Calley got into that scrap. ”\nLeaving Vietnam, Jack returned to Camp Pendleton where the Marines were putting together a replacement battalion which was in training until March 1968. Afterwards, he would be assigned to sea duty as the First Sergeant over 35 Marines on the USS Topeka with the duty of providing security over nuclear warheads. Sailing on to Florida, they had refresher training at Guantanamo Bay before heading to the Mediterranean for 7 months. After being based in Trieste, Italy, they would return across the North Atlantic to Boston, where their ship would be assigned to the scrap yard.\nReturning to the Jacksonville Air Station, he would serve as a troop handler for 6 months before getting orders back to Vietnam. In July 1969 he would serve in L Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines with Captain Krulak as his company commander. Krulak who would later become the Marine Commandant. During his tour he would meet the then Lieutenant Oliver North, which he considered a “nice, calm officer”, and would later see Colonel North at reunions. .\n“I was a Platoon Sergeant and we seen considerable combat and lost a lot of people”, he recounted. “We were set up in a finger area and stumbled upon the North Vietnamese. We lost half our patrol before a Staff Sergeant stopped their machine gun. We called in helicopters and aircraft and they retreated at midnight. A couple of months later they came back in and nearly wiped out a platoon. We lost 6 lieutenants, 4 of them in 3 months and I picked up a Bronze Star. One night 2 rounds came in on me, but they were both duds.\n“After the 3rd Division pulled out I went to the First Division south of Danang in November. In March, we walked into an ambush and I was hit 24 times by a mine with 12 pieces below my belt and the other 12 above. They sent me to Japan and on to Bremerrton, Washington for 4 months in the Bremerton Naval Hospital. Afterwards, I was sent back to Camp Pendleton with my arm still in a cast to serve as an instructor in 1970 and 1971. In 1972 I was picked out for an education program and went to a junior college for 2 years where I picked up an associate degree in political science and was promoted to Gunnery Sergeant.\nThen assigned back to Camp Pendleton Jack served as an advisor to Sea Bees Unit MCB3. “It was great duty”, he said. “We were the best in the fleet for 3 years and I made Master Sergeant. By that time I was wanting out and got out in December ’79 and bought a truck in 1980 that I drove until 1983”.\nHaving known Pat Newman “all my life and held her as a baby” the two have now been married for 40 years and live in Dandridge on Pat’s old homeplace. Using the GI Bill to go to vocational school, Jack built a 15 year career with TVA. Pat and Jack were avid elk hunters who made annual trips to New Mexico until 2018. He and Pat have daughters Debbie and Denise and 6 grandchilderen. Retiring in 2008, he tells that Pat is a quilter and that he is a qualified “quilter helper”\n“Wars are planned,” he ended. “Just watch the uniforms and they’ll tell where the next war will be”.",

    "title": "Farrier hails ‘incredible’ 2023 after horseshoes captivate millions on TikTok | Norwich Evening News",
    "text": "A farrier whose horseshoe videos have attracted celebrity endorsement and made him one of the UK’s most viewed TikTokers for a third year running has hailed 2023 as “incredible”. Sam Dracott, who smiths shoes for horses and treats infected hooves, appeared in the top 10 most-viewed TikTok videos in 2021 then was the UK’s number one most-viewed account of 2022 – and has now followed up the feat as the UK’s second-most viewed TikToker in 2023. The 34-year-old, from Weybridge, Surrey, boasts more than four million followers and more than 59.5 million likes – second only to Tool Tips which went viral for its staple creation – and said his success provides “huge recognition” for his often misunderstood job. “To be in the top 10 TikTok list once was incredible, twice was unbelievable and this third win three years in a row is just absolutely unreal,” the farrier told the PA news agency. “I can’t get over how the content continues to fascinate and inspire others. “It shows me huge recognition for everything we do and, that finally, it is becoming understood! “So many people have told me they are now considering a career becoming a farrier and that is something really special.” Mr Dracott’s videos, which have become a source of satisfaction for TikTok users, show how he changes horseshoes, removes debris, shaves down hooves and treats infections. His content even caught the attention of celebrities this year – including American singer Jason Derulo. “It’s been an incredible year… I got a message (from Jason Derulo) saying ‘I love your content, am I able to post it on my channel because I can’t stop watching it?’,” the TikToker said. “To have an international star tagging and seeing your videos, it’s a great feeling. It’s unbelievable.” Mr Dracott called his time working alongside broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh a career highlight and “a great experience” after he appeared on the gardener’s Love Your Weekend programme on ITV to showcase farriery. Mr Dracott posted his first video in April 2021 on the short-form app, which he said “exploded” after it was viewed by millions within four hours and earned him one million followers in one month. He was inspired to post footage of his day-to-day work after constantly being quizzed about his job but said it is rewarding to educate people about his profession. “It’s very rewarding,” he said. “When you’re in the equestrian world, you see it day in and day out so you don’t really think about it. “As soon as I posted the first video, it actually just blew up.” He added his job “sounds simple” but takes “years of practice” to master. “It’s an art that most people think has been lost, but it’s still there, still strong and there’s a lot more educational side to it – more than people think,” he said. “It’s a great feeling to educate people on that.” Mr Dracott’s main challenge as a content creator is debunking myths about the horses’ welfare as users often question if farriery hurts the animals. “A lot of people think horses don’t like having this or it hurts, but as farriers as our jobs, we’re increasing the horse’s working life and welfare, so we’re only there to help the animals,” he explained. He aims to use his platform to raise the profile of farriers in the UK to an international audience. “I’m trying to get people to realise that in the UK, farriers are training to such a high level compared to the rest of the world,” he said. “I’m trying to expose how highly qualified we are so it will be nice to do some international stuff.” The viral farrier described TikTok as a platform to help people “relieve a bit of stress” and urged creators to use the app for “good reasons”. He explained: “I think TikTok, used in the right way, is a fantastic way of educating and escaping reality. “Life’s quite stressful and it’s a nice way to escape and learn about how other people live and what they do. It’s exposing different angles and certain styles of living in, hopefully, a good way. “Keep trying to use the platform for good reasons rather than trying to expose it.”",

Avanzaron a las semifinales de la División II de la NCAA antes de perder contra Delaware.\nLos miembros de ese equipo, que usaban cascos rojos lisos, serán reconocidos en el medio tiempo del partido del sábado. El equipo fue incluido en el Salón de la Fama de Atletismo de UNLV en 1988.\nEl partido contra el oponente de FCS, Utah Tech, comenzará a las 12 del mediodía.\nEste es el tercer casco inspirado en el pasado que los Rebels usan bajo el mando del entrenador Barry Odom en su segundo año. La temporada pasada, los cascos de UNLV para su partido inaugural presentaron la fuente de “Rebels” de mediados de los años 80, cuando Randall Cunningham fue la estrella como mariscal de campo.\nCuando se enfrentaron a UTEP, los Rebels también usaron uniformes completamente blancos, con una calcomanía en el casco inspirada en el diseño usado de 1987 a 1989.",

    "text": "Descubre el polvo activo de Bosque Verde que revoluciona la limpieza del baño con su eficacia efervescente\nExcelente opción para quienes buscan un limpiador eficaz y fácil de usar sus inodoros.\n[Características](#span-style-font-size-20px-strongcaracteristicasnbsp-strong-span)[Fácil de usar](#span-style-font-size-20px-strongfacil-de-usar-strong-span)[Beneficios para el usuario](#span-style-font-size-20px-strongbeneficios-para-el-usuario-strong-span)[Sostenibilidad](#span-style-font-size-20px-strongnbsp-sostenibilidad-strong-span)[Disponibilidad y precio](#span-style-font-size-20px-strongdisponibilidad-y-precio-strong-span)[Opiniones de los usuarios](#span-style-font-size-20px-strongopiniones-de-los-usuarios-strong-span)\nCaracterísticas\nUna de las principales características del polvo activo es que es un polvo espumoso. Al entrar en contacto con el agua, el polvo se activa y produce espuma, que ayuda a descomponer la suciedad y la acumulación de cal en el inodoro. Esta acción espumante no sólo facilita la limpieza, sino que también tiene un efecto bactericida, eliminando los gérmenes y bacterias que puedan estar presentes en las superficies mojadas.\nFácil de usar\nBasta con verter el contenido de la bolsita en el inodoro y dejar actuar unos minutos. Durante este tiempo, la espuma penetra en la suciedad y los depósitos, facilitando la limpieza con un cepillo. Después de dejarlo reposar, basta con cepillar y aclarar con agua para mantener el inodoro limpio y fresco.\nBeneficios para el usuario\nUna de las mejores ventajas es que elimina las manchas difíciles y los depósitos calcáreos sin necesidad de frotar intensamente. Esto lo hace ideal para quienes buscan una solución eficaz y sencilla para mantener limpios los inodoros. Su uso regular también puede prevenir la acumulación de cal, ahorrando tiempo y esfuerzo de limpieza a largo plazo.\nEl aroma del producto es otro aspecto positivo. Muchos usuarios aprecian que, además de limpiar, este producto deja un aroma fresco y ayuda a eliminar los malos olores del inodoro. Esto hace que el ambiente del inodoro sea más agradable.\nSostenibilidad\nBosque Verde también es respetuoso con el medio ambiente, y aunque no todos los productos son completamente ecológicos, muchos contienen ingredientes que minimizan el impacto medioambiental. Además, son de un solo uso, por lo que sólo se utiliza la cantidad necesaria para cada limpieza, reduciendo así los residuos.\nDisponibilidad y precio\nEl polvo activo Bosque Verde está disponible principalmente en supermercados como Mercadona. Su precio suele rondar los 1,90 euros por envase, lo que lo convierte en una opción asequible para muchos hogares. Su disponibilidad y asequibilidad lo han convertido en una opción popular entre los consumidores.\nOpiniones de los usuarios\nLa mayoría de los usuarios han dejado comentarios positivos . Muchos de ellos destacan su eficacia para eliminar la suciedad y su agradable fragancia. Algunos usuarios también prefieren este producto a otros líquidos y geles por su facilidad de uso y eficacia.\nSin embargo, como ocurre con cualquier producto de limpieza, también hay opiniones encontradas. Algunos usuarios señalan que, aunque el producto es eficaz para la limpieza habitual, puede no ser suficiente para las manchas muy resistentes o las manchas calcáreas extremas que se han acumulado con el tiempo. En estos casos, puede ser necesario un tratamiento más intensivo o varios usos repetidos.",

Durante uma conversa com sua irmã mais nova, Giovanna Jacobina, nessa quinta-feira (23) ela admitiu que ganhou uma grande quantidade de ovos de outros participantes na Xepa, mas esses estão sobrando pois ela não comeu todos até o momento.\nOvos de sobra\nGracyanne Barbosa, de 41 anos de idade, já mantém há bastante tempo uma dieta muito específica, onde ela come, diariamente, uma grande quantidade de ovos. No início do reality, alguns telespectadores chegaram a se perguntar se ela conseguiria manter essa rotina durante o programa e como reagiria em certas situações. Nessa quinta-feira, durante uma conversa com sua irmã, Giovanna, a modelo e fisiculturista admitiu que ganhou diversos ovos de outros participantes.\n\"Eu ganhei tantos e não comi. Realmente as pessoas não comeram. O Edi, vários dias, não comeu. Devia ter comido as coisas\" contou ela durante a conversa com sua irmã.\nFoi criado até mesmo um ''ovometro'' no programa para acompanhar o consumo de ovos diário da participante.\nGracyanne Barbosa (Vídeo: reprodução/Instagram/@graoficial)\nDieta de Gracyanne Barbosa\nJá há bastante tempo, Gracyanne Barbosa conta que, para manter a forma, sua dieta consiste em comer diariamente uma quantidade de 40 ovos, sendo 30 claras e 10 ovos inteiros.\nSeguindo essa dieta, ela mantém as proteínas e a massa corporal.\nNo entanto, meses antes de o programa ir ao ar, ela já estava passando por um acompanhamento com nutricionistas para traçar um plano para não prejudicar sua dieta durante o BBB25 e conseguir manter a alimentação, estando na Xepa ou não.\nFoto destaque: Gracyanne Barbosa no BBB25 (Reprodução/@graoficial/X)",

Donc les amateurs de ski, qui n'ont pas complètement fini la saison, vont pouvoir en profiter, mais c'est peut-être la dernière fois qu'on aura ça.» On aborde aussi les quantités de neige importantes - jusqu'à 40 centimètres par endroit - qui sont tombées sur les régions de la Gaspésie, du Bas-Saint-Laurent et de Chaudière-Appalaches.",
