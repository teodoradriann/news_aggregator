    "text": "[Media](/media/)\nJerry Calà: \"Ho avuto l'onore di girare un film a Napoli ed è stata una cosa meravigliosa\"\nIl noto attore e regista parla del film girato nella città partenopea e dell'infarto avuto proprio durante gli ultimi giorni di lavorazione della pellicola\n\"Ho avuto l'onore di girare un film a Napoli, lì dove non avevo mai girato un film ed è stato una cosa meravigliosa. Ho passato un mese e mezzo bellissimo. Ho avuto a disposizione attori fantastici come Sergio Assisi, Nando Paone, Maurizio Casagrande, Barbara Foria. Poi Clementino ha scritto una canzone per i film\". Così Jerry Calà, ospite del programma di Caterina Balivo \"La volta buona\" in onda su Rai 1, ha parlato del suo nuovo film \"\nChi ha rapito Jerry Calà?\" e del periodo passato nella città partenopea.\n\"Il film è molto divertente, l’idea è molto originale, anche un po’ folle. Ho cercato di fare una commedia molto realistica e chi ha amato il cinema degli anni ’80, secondo me, amerà anche questo mio film. Ho cercato di riportare la leggerezza di quegli anni anche in questa commedia\", ha proseguito il noto attore e regista.\nCalà ha parlato anche\ndell'infarto avuto proprio a Napoli negli ultimi giorni di lavorazione del film: \"Proprio un paio di giorni prima della fine della lavorazione, tornando a Napoli dal Molise dove ho preso un freddo pazzesco, non so quale sia stato il motivo, forse era una cosa latente, stavo mangiando in camera in albergo e ho sentito una fitta fortissima. Speravo fosse un’indigestione e invece era un infartino. Adesso ho tre stent. Non perdo occasione per ringraziare la clinica Mediterranea di Napoli e la buona sanità che mi ha salvato la vita\".",

    "text": "Premier League leaders Liverpool ruthlessly exploited another slip by their title rivals to move seven points clear with a match in hand after a 3-1 win over Leicester.\nChelsea’s surprise defeat at home to Fulham earlier in the day had been an unexpected gift for Arne Slot’s side and they drove home their advantage by outclassing the struggling Foxes.\nHaving overcome the early setback of conceding to Jordan Ayew, with even the travelling fans expressing their surprise they were winning away after taking just five points on the road this season, the home team had too much quality.\nMohamed Salah, second left, celebrates after scoring Liverpool’s third goal against Leicester (Peter Byrne/PA) That was personified by the excellent Cody Gakpo, whose eighth goal in his last 14 appearances produced the equaliser in first-half added time with the Netherlands international unlucky to have a second ruled out for offside by VAR.\nFurther goals from Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah, with his 19th of the season, stretched Liverpool’s unbeaten run to 22 matches.\nFor Leicester, who had slipped into the bottom three after Wolves’ win over Manchester United, it is now one win from the last 10 in the league and Ruud van Nistelrooy has plenty of work to do, although he was not helped here by the absence of leading scorer Jamie Vardy through injury.\nIt looked liked Liverpool meant business from the off with Salah’s volley from Gakpo’s far-post cross just being kept out by Jakub Stolarczyk, making his league debut after former Liverpool goalkeeper Danny Ward was omitted from the squad having struggled in the defeat to Wolves.\nBut if the hosts thought that had set the tone they were badly mistaken after being opened up with such simplicity in only the sixth minute.\nJordan Ayew celebrates after putting Leicester in front (Peter Byrne/PA) Stephy Mavididi broke down the left and his low cross picked out Ayew, who turned Andy Robertson far too easily, with his shot deflecting off Virgil van Dijk to take it just out of Alisson Becker’s reach.\nWith a surprise lead to cling to Leicester knew they had to quell the storm heading their way and they began by trying to take as much time out of the game as they could, much to Anfield’s frustration.\nIt took a further 18 minutes for Liverpool to threaten with Gakpo cutting in from the left to fire over, a precursor for what was to follow just before half-time.\nThat was the prompt for the attacks to rain down on the Foxes goal, with Salah’s shot looping up off Victor Kristiansen and landing on the roof of the net and Robertson heading against a post.\nGakpo’s inclination to come in off the left was proving a problem for the visitors, doing their utmost to resist the pressure, but when Salah curled a shot onto the crossbar on the stroke of half-time it appeared they had survived.\nCody Gakpo curls in Liverpool’s first goal (Peter Byrne/PA) However, Gakpo once again drifted in off the flank to collect an Alexis Mac Allister pass before curling what is fast becoming his trademark effort over Stolarczyk and inside the far post.\nEarly the second half Darwin Nunez fired over Ryan Gravenberch’s cross before Jones side-footed home Mac Allister’s cross after an intricate passing move inside the penalty area involving Nunez, Salah and the Argentina international.\nLeicester’s ambition remained limited but Patson Daka should have done better from a two-on-one counter attack with Mavididi but completely missed his kick with the goal looming.\n🎯 pic.twitter.com/IqmAsKylLR\n— Liverpool FC (@LFC) December 26, 2024\nNunez forced a save out of the goalkeeper before Gakpo blasted home what he thought was his second only for VAR to rule Nunez was offside in the build-up.\nBut Liverpool’s third was eventually delivered by the left foot of Salah, who curled the ball outside Kristiansen, inside Jannick Vestergaard and past Stolarczyk inside the far post.\nSport",

    "text": "News\nFarmers glad to see dicamba back in toolbox for 2024\nA director with the American Soybean Association says he’s pleased the Environmental Protection Agency is allowing farmers to use existing stocks of dicamba for the upcoming growing season.\nThis week, EPA issued an existing stocks order for dicamba, allowing for its limited use in 2024. The order applies to dicamba that was “packaged, labeled, and released for shipment” prior to a February 6 ruling that vacated dicamba registration.\nAlan Meadows, a western Tennessee farmer, tells Brownfield he uses the herbicide to control weeds in his soybeans and there was uncertainty about the product following a recent court ruling.\n“It left a lot of questions here on our farm about exactly how we’d move forward, what the next steps would be.”\nMeadows says there’s more clarity now and he’s not concerned about getting the dicamba supplies he needs.\n“There should be plenty of existing stocks as of today, based on how I understand it. That’s always subject to change, but right now, that’s how I understand it.”\nMeadows says he’s looking for more certainty on the future of dicamba use beyond the upcoming growing season so he can make the best product decisions for 2025.\nMeadows is an at-large member of the 2024 ASA Executive Committee.",

El régimen ha respondido con extrema brutalidad”, recordó Giménez, nacido en Cuba.\nA su turno, en un comunicado, el Partido Demócrata de Florida rememoró que hace tres años el pueblo cubano tomó las calles en “la manifestación más grande en décadas” para demandar la libertad.\n“Desde el 11 de julio de 2021, el régimen cubano ha mantenido en prisión a cientos de manifestantes pacíficos y ha continuado sus esfuerzos por silenciar a los cubanos, intimidar a los manifestantes y detener a presos políticos”, dijo la presidenta de los demócratas de Florida, Nikki Fried .\nFried pidió la liberación de líderes destacados de la oposición cubana, como José Daniel Ferrer, Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara, Félix Navarro Rodríguez, Pedro Luis Boitel, y su hija Saylí Navarro, además de Maikel ‘El Osorbo’, uno de los compositores e intérpretes de la canción ‘Patria y Vida’, convertida en himno de las históricas marchas.\nEl 11 de julio de 2021 se registró una jornada de protestas histórica en Cuba que dio pie a los continuos reclamos en contra del régimen que se presentan aún en la isla (EFE/ARCHIVO) El senador por Florida Marco Rubio lamentó que desde las protestas de hace tres años las cosas “se han puesto peor” en Cuba, no solo por el número de presos y las largas condenas, sino por la situación “desbaratada” de la economía nacional que ha llevado a que un 5 % de su población haya abandonado la isla.\n“El marxismo no funciona, la dictadura no funciona, y están destruyendo un bello país que merece la libertad ”, agregó el senador, de origen cubano.\nEl grupo del exilio M.A.R. por Cuba hizo un llamado a los gobiernos democráticos y a la comunidad internacional para que se coloquen del “lado de los cubanos que luchan por la patria, la vida y la libertad”.\nPor su parte, la Asamblea de la Resistencia Cubana hizo eco hoy de la carta “Nosotros Somos Plantados”, que tres presos políticos cubanos firmaron y sacaron de la prisión de forma clandestina, y en la que piden al pueblo “continuar oponiéndose a la dictadura dentro y fuera de prisión”.\nLos firmantes de la misiva, Arianna López Roque , y el matrimonio compuesto por Donaida Pérez Paseiro y Loreto Hernández García , informaron que se reafirmaron en su condición de “plantados” tras negarse a participar “en el programa de ‘reducación’ y ‘adoctrinamiento’ impuesto en las cárceles castristas a los que se oponen a la dictadura”.\nEste mismo jueves, la organización Prisoners Defenders (PD) informó que al cierre de junio llevan contabilizados un total de 1.117 personas encarceladas en Cuba por razones políticas, cuatro más que los incluidos en su reporte mensual anterior.\nLa organización, con sede en Madrid, detalló que en mayo añadió a su listado cinco personas consideradas presas políticas y que una salió del registro tras el cumplimiento íntegro de la pena impuesta.\n(Con información de EFE)",

    "text": "Minas Gerais é o primeiro no ranking nacional de florestas plantadas\nSão cerca de 1,3 milhões de hectares no Estado e 803 municípios mineiros têm plantio florestal\n16 de fevereiro de 2024 às 5h12\nMinas Gerais ocupa a primeira posição no ranking de florestas plantadas do Brasil com 2.3 milhões de hectares. A liderança dos plantios mineiros representa 24% de toda a base florestal do Brasil. Isso representa quase o dobro da área plantada no estado de São Paulo, o segundo colocado no ranking com 1.2 milhão de hectares. Os dados fazem parte de um levantamento inédito realizado pela Associação Mineira da Indústria Florestal (Amif) em parceria com a Indústria Brasileira de Árvores (Ibá) e outras associações estaduais representativas do setor.\nCom relação a árvores conservadas, são cerca de 1,3 milhões de hectares no Estado e 803 municípios mineiros têm plantio florestal, o que representa 94% das cidades de Minas Gerais. Com relação ao plantio de árvores em\nterritório mineiro, 96,8% são de eucaliptos.\nO eucalipto dá origem a produtos essenciais para a sociedade desde o carvão vegetal amplamente utilizado para a produção de aço, ferro-gusa e ferroligas na indústria siderúrgica – sendo uma matéria-prima que também solidifica a posição do Estado como\nlíder mundial em produção e consumo – até papel e celulose, painéis, chapas, pisos laminados, madeira natural, madeira tratada, dentre outros.
