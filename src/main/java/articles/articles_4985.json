    "text": "Thousands of gray whales are migrating north from Mexico's Baja lagoons in visibly emaciated condition , with some so thin their ribs are protruding. Researchers report record-low calf numbers and fear another mass die-off is underway, per a report published in The Oregonian . Scientists point to the warming Arctic as the root cause of the potential crisis. Melting sea ice disrupts the growth of algae that feeds the seafloor ecosystem, which in turn supports the shrimp-like amphipods gray whales depend on. With less food available, whales are arriving at breeding grounds malnourished and leaving with even less energy to complete their 12,000-mile migration north. \"All the signs are indicating there has been a pretty intensive change in the Arctic,\" said Josh Stewart, an ecologist in Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. This isn't the gray whale's first crisis. Between 2018 and 2023, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an \" unusual mortality event \" after nearly 700 gray whales stranded along the West Coast. Though the declaration was lifted in late 2023, spring's alarming reports suggest the threat is far from over. What's more, gray whale calves are nearly nowhere to be found. During the whales' fall southbound journey, not a single calf was spotted — a first in over 40 years of tracking. Now, on their northbound return, only three calves have been observed, compared to 21 just last year. \"The numbers so far are the lowest ever and the whales we are seeing are extremely emaciated,\" said Alisa Schulman-Janiger, a leading whale census worker. \"They have bulging ribs with shoulder blades and vertebrae visible even from shore. It's really just horrific.\" Gray whales are resilient — they've survived commercial whaling and past climate shifts. But their challenges are piling up: warming oceans, shrinking food supplies, and microplastics. A recent study found that nearly 70% of marine mammals sampled had microplastics embedded in their lungs and fat. When whales struggle, it's a warning sign for the rest of the world. These animals help regulate the ocean's carbon cycle and support the food chains that coastal communities rely on for everything from fishing to tourism. A collapse in whale populations signals deeper instability in marine ecosystems, which can threaten livelihoods, local economies, and even our access to affordable, sustainable seafood. The ocean is absorbing 90% of the planet's excess heat, and marine heat waves are now reaching the seafloor, lasting longer and hitting harder than surface events.

    "title": "AI inspires innovation in journalism education",
    "text": "Ten years ago, I submitted my first Nieman Lab prediction, in which I made the provocation that product management would be the new model for journalism . I am encouraged by the thriving news product community that has emerged over the past decade. However, journalism education, with few exceptions, has not comprehensively responded to support this digital product shift. But I predict that journalism education will experience a new era of innovation due to the continued adoption of and experimentation with artificial intelligence applications. While many lament the possibilities for AI to replace both journalists and educators, I feel that there are approaches to AI that can achieve improved outcomes for both teachers and learners.\nCurriculum modifications Adding the newest technology into curriculum takes motivation, commitment, and time. Many recognize the deficiencies in traditional journalism curriculum but feel overwhelmed by or not empowered to embark on innovation. AI can reduce the effort it takes to assess, learn, and apply new technologies and emerging concepts, from adding modules to an existing course, to developing new courses based on current programming languages or applications, to undertaking full-scale curriculum redesign. Not only can it provide customized code samples for programming exercises or step-by-step descriptions of new software features, it can assist with syllabi and course development, contextualize explanations of difficult concepts and organize them into course modules and presentations. And it can suggest recommendations for degree plans and curriculum modifications that could result in more adaptable programs that are more responsive to student career outcomes (you are on your own with getting changes approved by your curriculum committees, though).\nHelping students through their own learning process, particularly for technology training, takes more time and heavy doses of patience. AI can provide support for students in their own learning process. For example, in my Mobile App Development course, I used ChatGPT to learn and update examples using the newest version of the Swift programming language. Then I added lessons encouraging students to use AI in developing their own projects. The quality of the code created, as well as the explanations provided by the AI platform, greatly reduced students’ apprehension and stress. Students were better able to achieve their project visions, and I enjoyed the support of an AI teaching assistant that could help students with troubleshooting and coding errors. Students also exercised judgment with the post-exercise reflections discussing their approaches to prompting and the quality of the work they created with the assistance of AI.\nInspiring confidence In addition to learning new technologies, AI can increase students’ confidence in traditional skills. In my graduate Digital Issues course, students are assigned readings and weekly posts on digital media theory, cyberculture research, data journalism, social media, immersive media, and law and policy issues. Toward the end of the semester, I became aware of the Google product NotebookLM , uploaded my last nine years of Nieman Lab predictions and had it generate a podcast with two realistically human sounding “hosts” talking about my articles. I was blown away by what it produced and more than a bit impressed by how it engaged with my work. I couldn’t wait to give students a chance to try it. I had them upload links to each of their posts and generate their own AI podcasts. Student reflections indicated that hearing the “hosts” engage with their writing and ideas gave them more confidence in what they had created. They were also able to critique what did and did not work well in the AI-generated conversations.\nAugmenting creativity One of the exercises in my undergraduate Digital Media Innovation Capstone course involved guiding students through a lean canvas exercise. The lean canvas is a tool that explores an innovative concept or idea, providing a format for identifying the problem statement, customer segments, value proposition, distribution channels, and financial considerations. After we completed the exercise, I introduced them to ZigZag , a web-based, AI tool that creates a lean canvas based on a single prompt. I asked students to compare the AI-created canvas to what they had created. Their comments included that the AI version was more comprehensive and gave them more creative ways to consider the problem they were addressing. They also indicated limitations, including the often non-specific nature and impersonal tone of AI-generated output. In addition to the canvas, ZigZag also provided sample questions for empathy interviews, elevator pitch suggestions, potential startup names, and even sample code for a simple landing page (which happens to be our final project). When used effectively, students found that this tool could help validate a concept and recommend new directions and ideas, all part of the innovation process.\nSome may wonder if we’ll actually need teachers in the future, with AI providing such high-quality instruction, constant availability, and seemingly limitless patience. But with the fast pace of change and the volume of potential topics and concepts to be learned, the role of educator will shift to become more that of curator and coach, guiding students toward the topics and approaches that will be most useful to them in the future and inspiring confidence in their ability to learn and apply them to the problems they wish to solve. The educator will also model and encourage the critical thinking and ethical considerations necessary to judge the quality of AI output and how to best integrate it with the human element.\nIn these examples, which are but a few of the ways in which AI can be integrated into journalism curricula, the AI tools pushed students outside their comfort zones to achieve project goals, gain confidence in their work, validate ideas, and critique their output. And it provided an agency for them to do so on their own, a self-sufficiency that should serve them well as they navigate careers in which lifelong learning will be required. It will be the educators’ job to direct students in the most effective ways to use AI to extend their capabilities, not replace them. We are just at the beginning of understanding the application of AI in educational environments. The tools will get better, the outputs will become more realistic and the shifting nature of the human emphasis will need to be continuously reevaluated and appreciated. But I, for one, welcome our AI overlords in inspiring a new era of innovation in journalism education.\nCindy Royal is a professor at the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Texas State University.",

El ataque ha tenido lugar alrededor de las 21.05 horas (hora local), cuando el atacante ha detenido su vehículo cerca del puesto de control y ha apuñalado a dos miembros del personal de seguridad, que han sido trasladados al hospital para recibir tratamiento. \"Neutralizaron al terrorista disparando y, posteriormente, incautaron el cuchillo, que se sospecha que fue utilizado para llevar a cabo el ataque\", reza un comunicado de la Policía publicado en su perfil de la red social X, antes conocida como Twitter. El servicio de ambulancias de la Magen David Adom (Estrella de David Roja), que se ha trasladado hasta el lugar del incidente, ha detallado que ha tratado y evacuado a dos heridos, que son una mujer de 20 años y un hombre de 25 años. Por su parte, la agencia de noticias palestina WAFA ha informado de que el Ejército israelí ha registrado la vivienda del sospechoso, identificado como Ahmed Alyan, y ha detenido a sus padres y su hermana. El suceso tienen lugar en medio del aumento de las tensiones en la región a raíz de los ataques ejecutados el 7 de octubre por el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás) contra Israel, que dejaron cerca de 1.200 muertos y cerca de 240 secuestrados. Las autoridades de Gaza, controladas por la milicia palestina, han denunciado casi 21.000 muertos a causa de la ofensiva israelí contra la Franja, a los que se suman más de 300 palestinos muertos en Cisjordania y Jerusalén Este.\nDos heridos leves en un ataque con arma blanca en un puesto de control cerca de Jerusalén\nDEPORTES\nEl eufórico festejo de Alejo Véliz tras convertir su primer gol en el Tottenham: “Los tiempos de Dios son perfectos”\nLa llamativa respuesta de Novak Djokovic cuando le preguntaron si es el mejor deportista de todos los tiempos\n¿Nació el amor en el crucero?

    "title": "El piragüismo asturiano llora la muerte de Juan Carlos López Villalobos, ganador del Sella en 1994 - La Nueva España",
    "text": "El veterano piragüista palentino Juan Carlos López Villalobos, de 65 años, con un gran palmarés que incluye el triunfo en el Descenso del Sella de 1994 y que llegó a ser campeón del mundo en su categoría, fue hallado muerto el miércoles por la tarde por la Guardia Civil en el interior de una furgoneta cámper estacionada en las inmediaciones del Club de Remo de Tui (Pontevedra). Según fuentes oficiales de la Comandancia de la Guardia Civil de Pontevedra, fue un testigo el que el miércoles a primera hora de la tarde alertó de la presencia de una cámper en las inmediaciones de las instalaciones del club de remo y de la que salía un fuerte olor. Inmediatamente, los agentes se desplazaron a la zona y, tras cotejar la matrícula del vehículo y los datos del propietario, vieron que ese mismo día se había interpuesto en Palencia una denuncia por su desaparición. Al abrir la puerta trasera del vehículo se toparon con el cuerpo sin vida y en un avanzado estado de descomposición. El instituto armado señala que el cuerpo no tenía signos de violencia, por lo que todo apunta a una muerte natural. Las mismas fuentes señalan que la víctima mortal, presidente del Club Tritones de Alar, había viajado a Tui para participar el pasado día 24 de agosto en el Descenso Internacional del Miño. Con todo, dado el estado del cuerpo, el médico de guardia evitó declarar la muerte como natural y los restos han sido trasladados para ser sometidos a una autopsia. Juan Carlos López Villalobos fue campeón del Sella en 1994 y tercero en 1998, en ambas oportunidades haciendo barco de equipo con Luis Medrano Miguel. El año que ganó, el K-2 del cangués Ton Soto Zaragoza y del luanquín Juan Ramón González, \\\"Monotos, fue tercero. El fallecimiento del palista palentino causó profunda consternación en la ribera del Sella y, por ende, en toda la comarca del Oriente de Asturias. \\\"Una gran pérdida. Un deportista con el que me tocó competir cara a cara algunos años en mi juventud y solo tengo buenas palabras. Un señor dentro y fuera del agua\\\", dijo sobre el finado Walter Bouzán (Club Piragüismo El Sella), once veces vencedor de la carismática prueba sellera, la Fiesta de las Piraguas de Asturias. Para el máximo responsable del Comité Organizador del Descenso Internacional del Sella (CODIS), Juan Manuel Feliz Granda, la figura de Juan Carlos López Villalobos era, sin lugar a dudas, \\\"una referencia en el mundo del piragüismo por sus triunfos en la especialidad de maratón y descenso de ríos. En la comarca del Sella siempre se le recordará por su victoria en la 58ª edición del Descenso Internacional, en el año 1994, con su compañero Medrano. Falleció haciendo lo que le apasionaba. Desde el CODIS enviamos nuestras condolencias a su familia y amigos\\\". El parragués Maxi Llamedo Blanco, actual miembro del CODIS, paleó el pasado fin de semana, 23 y 24 de agosto, el Campeonato de España máster de ríos, simultáneamente Descenso Internacional del río Miño, en Tui, donde coincidió con Juan Carlos López Villalobos en la categoría máster K-1, grupo de edad de 65 a 69 años. Maxi, que defendió en esa ocasión los colores de La Cultural de Ribadesella, quedó segundo clasificado, siendo el título de campeón de España precisamente para López Villalobos (Tritones Pisuerga); en tanto, el metal de bronce se lo anotó Jose Antonio Lucas Albadalejo (Piraguismo Mar Menor). \\\"Estuvimos charlando el viernes y el sabado. Vaya faena\\\", comentó apenado Llamedo, otro vencedor del mítico Descenso Internacional del Sella, hace justo cuatro décadas, en 1984, en K-2, junto con su hermano Milio.",

(Ed Morlock/MediaNews Group) By Ed Morlock | emorlock@timesherald.com | The Times Herald PUBLISHED: April 11, 2024 at 8:34 p.m. | UPDATED: April 11, 2024 at 8:58 p.m. TOWAMENCIN >> North Penn’s Gabby Battavio led off the bottom of the first inning against Pennsbury with a single. She advanced to second on an error, scored on a single and the Knights led the rest of the way.\nNorth Penn scored in five different innings to support a strong outing from pitcher Bella Nunn in a 9-2 Suburban One League crossover win over Pennsbury Thursday afternoon at North Penn High School.\n“We got a run in almost every inning,” North Penn coach Rick Torresani said. “That’s what we try to do. If you score seven runs, you usually win the game. The kids are playing, they’re starting to hit the ball.”\nCasey Sokol and Nunn had RBI singles in the bottom of the first inning to build a 2-0 lead. The Knights (7-1, 4-1 SOL Colonial) added two more in the second when Izzy Tubertini tripled and scored on an error and Gianna Cimino singled home Battavio to make it a 4-0 game.\nNorth Penn’s Izzy Tubertini stands on third base after hitting a triple against Pennsbury Thursday, April 11, 2024. (Ed Morlock/MediaNews Group) Tallie Smink had an RBI single off the left-center fence in the third inning and Cimino added another RBI single in the fourth to extend the lead to 6-0.\n“Everyone was just seeing the ball really well today,” Nunn said. “We’ve been hitting well in practice, too. Once someone started hitting, everyone else got on the train and the energy just kept going and everyone contributed.”\nAfter the Falcons (3-2, 2-1 SOL Patriot) got a run back in the top of the sixth inning on a Jaylynn Rodweller RBI single, North Penn responded with a three-run bottom of the sixth. Nunn hit a two-run home run, her second of the season, over the right field fence and another run scored on an error, making it 9-1.\nPennsbury, which scored its second run on an Anna Evanchik RBI single in the top of the seventh, was able to get runners on base in the early innings, but couldn’t bring them home. The Falcons left runners on base in every inning, including runners in scoring position in the first, second, third, sixth and seventh innings.\n“We didn’t get the hit when we needed to and they did,” Pennsbury coach Frank McSherry said. “It seemed like every opportunity they had to score runs they did. That’s a credit to them. They weren’t hitting pop-ups. They were hitting shots through holes and hitting hard ground balls. They scored a ton of two-out runs and that was part of the difference.”\nNorth Penn’s Bella Nunn throws a pitch against Pennsbury Thursday, April 11, 2024. (Ed Morlock/MediaNews Group) Nunn was a big reason why the Falcons couldn’t get those key hits. She scattered eight hits – five of which came in the sixth and seventh innings – while striking out eight batters to one walk.\n“I’m just focused on one pitch at a time,” Nunn, who was having success with all her pitches, said, “just block the runner out on the bases and focus on the batter there because it’s already in the past. You just have to get the next out.”\n“It’s being tough and knowing that, ‘I’m not going to let a run score, they’re out there but I’m going to bare down and they’re going to have to hit a good pitch,'” Torresani said of Nunn with runners on base. “That’s what she’s done all season. She had a little hiccup against CB West, but other than that she’s been doing really well.\n“She’s doing really well and has a great attitude.”\nKylie Dressel took the loss for Pennsbury. In six innings she allowed nine runs on 12 hits with four strikeouts to two walks. The Falcons committed five errors that helped extend innings for North Penn.\nPennsbury’s Kylie Dressel threw a complete game against North Penn Thursday, April 11, 2024.

Am 29. Juli 2025 konnte die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) in der 4. Verhandlungsrunde einen Tarifabschluss erzielen.\n“Die Kolleginnen und Kollegen haben sich dieses Ergebnis hart erkämpft – das ist ihr Erfolg!”, so NGG-Verhandlungsführer Alexander Münchow. Trotz schwieriger Gespräche und der unverhältnismäßigen Aussperrung beim Lieken-Werk in Crailsheim bleibt am Ende ein starker Abschluss:\n- Löhne und Gehälter steigen rückwirkend zum 1. April 2025 um 3 Prozent, zum 1. Juni 2026 um 2,4 Prozent und zum 1. Januar 2027 nochmals um 0,9 Prozent – insgesamt also 6,42 Prozent.\n- Ausbildungsvergütungen steigen in beiden Bundesländern in 3 Stufen deutlich an.\n- Die Tarifliche Übernahmegarantie für Azubis bleibt bestehen.\n- Die Laufzeit des Tarifvertrags beträgt 24 Monate, kündbar frühestens zum 28. Februar 2027.\nBetroffen vom Tarifabschluss sind u. a. die Lieken-Werke in Bietigheim-Bissingen und Crailsheim, die Glockenbrot-Bäckerei Frankfurt sowie Erlenbacher Backwaren Groß-Gerau.\nMit dem Abschluss konnten weitere Streiks abgewendet werden – dank des starken Zusammenhalts und der Entschlossenheit der Beschäftigten.",

    "text": "Sightseeing visits have been barred at Germany’s landmark cathedral in Cologne and Christmas Eve worshippers face security checks to get into midnight Mass as police responded to indications of a potential attack. However, a top security official urged people not to shy away from holiday celebrations out of fear. Churchgoers attended multiple services at the cathedral despite the ban on visits purely for sightseeing, a day after police descended on the cathedral and searched it with sniffer dogs. With several dozen officers on duty outside, Auxiliary Bishop Rolf Steinhaeuser greeted those attending what he said was “probably the most secure church service in all of Germany”. In Austria, police said they also were stepping up security around Vienna’s churches and Christmas markets, apparently responding to the same intelligence about a potential threat. They did not give further information, but the dpa news agency reported without citing a source that the threat came from an Islamic extremist group. Police in Cologne said they were taking precautions over Christmas even though the information they had was for an attack on New Year’s Eve. “Even if the reference was to New Year’s Eve, there are a lot of people in the area around the cathedral, today is Christmas Eve midnight Mass, it is one of the most visited cathedrals, the main train station is nearby,” police spokesman Wolfgang Baldes said while standing in front of the cathedral. “There are a lot of people, and that’s why we said that if there was an indication, we would do everything necessary to protect people,” Mr Baldes added. Cathedral Provost Guido Assmann said in an interview on the Cologne Archdiocese website domradio.de that halting sightseeing visits did not represent a big change since such visits are normally not allowed during services anyway, and services were scheduled throughout the day on Sunday. Cologne’s towering cathedral, whose twin spires rise 515ft high, is a major tourist destination visited by some six million people a year. It is home to the Shrine of the Three Kings, a gold- and silver-decorated casket said to contain the relics of the three wise men described in the New Testament as paying homage to the newborn Jesus. Police and cathedral officials urged churchgoers planning to attend Mass on Sunday night to arrive early and not bring bags or purses. At the same time, Herbert Reul, interior minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, appealed to the public not to stay away. “Caution is advised,” he said, but “we are not defenceless. Our agencies are using all available information to protect us as well as possible”. Mr Reul added: “My appeal is, go to church, celebrate Christmas. Fear is the currency of terrorists. We should not make it more valuable.” The European Union’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, warned on December 5 that Europe faces a “huge risk of terrorist attacks” over the Christmas holidays due to fallout from the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.",
