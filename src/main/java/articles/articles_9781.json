    "title": "Canny Srihari Shocks Russian Gm Savchenko | - Times of India",
    "text": "Bengaluru: Young Srihari L of Puducherry began the New Year with the biggest win of his career as he shocked 14th seed Grandmaster Boris Savchenko of Russia in the second round of the 1st Bangalore International Grandmasters Open Chess tournament here on Friday.Top seed Abhijeet Gupta was held to a draw by Karnataka’s GM MS Thejkumar in the third round. Gupta, who beat IM Avinash Ramesh in the second round, has a tally of 2.5 points. Legendary English GM Nigel Short faced a stiff challenge from young Goutham Krishna H before winning in the second round and then added the scalp of Amit Doshi Moksh in the third to be in joint lead. A total of seven players, including Karnataka's young GM Pranav Anand and IM Antonio Dcunha Viani, share the lead. The 17-year-old, who won the World U-16 title in 2022, got the better of Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury in the second round before beating Vietnam GM Duc Hoa Nguyen in the third round.It was Srihari’s first victory against Savchenko, who had defeated the Indian during their previous two matches. Playing black, Srihari, who has a rating of 2288 points, opted for the Classical Sicilian variation and worked his way past the Russian's defence to score his second straight win at the Sree Kanteerava indoor stadium. The Russian had the option to force a draw but went down to the youngster as he pressed hard for the victory.Srihari, who had downed Rishi Vijayakumar in the first round, failed to continue his fine show as he crashed to a defeat in the third round against Sammed Jaykumar Shete of Maharashtra, who jumped into joint lead.In Category B, Karnataka's Bhuvan Krishna Prasanth scored his fourth consecutive victory to share the lead with 20 others. Select results: Category A: Round 3: Abhijeet Gupta (Ind, 2.5) drew with Thejkumar MS (Ind, 2.5); Nigel Short (Eng, 3) bt Amit Doshi Moksh (Ind, 2); Aronyak Ghosh (Ind, 2.5) drew with RR Laxman (Ind, 2.5); Pranav Anand (Ind, 3) bt Duc Hoa Nguyen (Vie, 2); Aswath S (Ind, 2.5) drew with Mitrabha Guha (Ind, 2.5) Round 2: Avinash Ramesh (Ind, 1) lost to Abhijeet (2); Goutham Krishna H (Ind, 1) lost to N Short (2); Suyog Wagh (Ind, 1) lost to Aronyak (Ind, 2); Saurabh Anand (Ind, 1.5) drew with Iniyan (Ind, 1.5); Saptarshi RC (Ind, 1) lost to Pranav Anand (Ind, 2).",

Na sexta-feira, 3, os termômetros marcam cerca de 20°C na madrugada e chegam a 30°C no período da tarde, com umidade mínima do ar em torno dos 50%. Pancadas de chuva são esperadas à tarde, com intensidade moderada a forte.\nJá o sábado, 4, amanhece com maior quantidade de nuvens, apesar do sol. Os termômetros deverão registrar 20°C em média, com índices de umidade elevados, acima dos 60%. A aproximação de uma frente fria deve estimular a formação de nuvens carregadas à tarde e à noite, elevando o potencial para a elevação dos níveis de rios e córregos, alagamentos e quedas de árvores.\nTranstornos em Campinas e no Paraná\nEm Campinas, no interior paulista, a Defesa Civil registrou 16 ocorrências relacionadas à forte chuva desta quinta. Foram 11 quedas de árvores e cinco de galhos. Não há registro de feridos.\nParte dos galhos caiu no Bosque dos Jequitibás e o local de lazer será aberto ao público mais tarde nesta sexta, a partir das 12h, para o trabalho de limpeza e liberação da pista de caminhada.\nSegundo a prefeitura, houve dois pontos de alagamento e o Centro de Saúde Anchieta precisou suspender temporariamente o serviço de vacinação por problemas em uma geladeira devido à oscilação de energia.\nA chuva também causou transtornos em cidades do Paraná. De acordo com a Defesa Civil de Morretes, mais de 20 famílias tiveram suas casas atingidas e ocorreram diversas quedas de árvore em vias públicas. Algumas regiões do município estão sem fornecimento de energia.",

    "text": "Ricochet is the best place on the internet to discuss the issues of the day, either through commenting on posts or writing your own for our active and dynamic community in a fully moderated environment. In addition, the Ricochet Audio Network offers over 50 original podcasts with new episodes released every day.\n<a href=\"https://ricochet.com/member-feed/recommended/\">\n</a>\nWHO Ya Gonna Hold Acountable?\nThe Biden Administration with its characteristic short-sightedness and perverse inclinations both to surrender American sovereignty and to betray the well-being of the people now wants to let the\nWorld Health Organization dictate American health policy during the next pandemic. (See this by John Tierney The WHO’s Power Grab)\nWHO got it very wrong on COVID, and never budged even as the evidence mounted. In addition to incompetence (and corruption?), the deference to China and a love of centralizing power disqualifies that outfit from ever receiving unquestioning US support.\nRather than yield any authority to WHO, we should instead demand either full accountability or else we start cutting funding, except for expressly solid programs from a very focused menu (e.g., clean water projects, snakebite treatment, direct medical aid to poor regions etc).\nTime to push back. Here is a recommendation to the Senate, now pondering a bill to reject deference to WHO:\n- The United States will not sign any agreement that constrains the policymaking powers of the federal, state, or local health officials, or otherwise stipulates mandatory deference or conformity to any international organization.\n- As a condition for not reducing the funding contribution of the United States to WHO by whatever amounts it is determined would otherwise go to pandemic preparedness or related activities, we demand the immediate dismissal of any or all employees and the perpetual termination of consultancies or funded NGOs who at any time after May 1, 2020:\n- Recommended or claimed scientific justification for extended closures as a suppression strategy (existing science and the lack of absence of any benefit in the first months of the pandemic made this approach unjustifiable);\n- Publicly endorsed the ungrounded falsehood that the virus could not have originated in the laboratory setting in which it was actually created (competent virologists – not funded by Fauci’s agency – had argued at the outset for the near-impossibility of a spontaneous natural origin);\n- Endorsed and/or claimed the effectiveness of the draconian policies China executed in response to the pandemic, or claimed their efficacy;\n- Claimed that mask mandates had a significant effect in any jurisdiction (existing RTCs involving previous respiratory viral pandemics unanimously found little to no reduction from such policies–there was no reason to expect it to work this time);\n- Claimed that any of the available vaccines would prevent the spread, and should therefore be made mandatory;\n- Claimed that children were at greater risk than from other recently common flu viruses and that schools should be closed (The American Academy of Pediatrics found no such risk and expressly recommended against such closures in May 2020–the data regarding kids and COVID-19 was already sufficient by then);\n- Expressly rejected or criticized the policy option of shifting focus to protect the expressly vulnerable rather than continue failed general suppression strategies (The Great Barrington Declaration group was right. Fauci and WHO were wrong. There must be acknowledgment and accountability.);\n- At any time attributed a drop in the infection rate to policy actions when that same decline was occurring simultaneously in other jurisdictions, in the same seasonality region, that did not follow those policies (America’s health “leaders” Birx, Fauci, Redfield appeared to be oblivious to the overwhelmingly uniform seasonality patterns of the pandemic);\n…unless, prior to March 2021, the offending persons or organizations revised, retracted, and corrected their offending statements as identified above and committed no subsequent offense.\nWe want names and documents. Those people don’t get to go near policymaking ever again. And we should simultaneously clean house here in the USA as an example to the world.\nThe growing worldwide problem of dysfunctional governance is caused by the growth of national and international administrative states for which there is no accountability for failure or outright abuse. Elected leaders can be voted out as a consequence of bad choices, but how do we punish bad behavior by EPA, WHO, IRS, DOJ, FBI, or the vast bureaucratic rat’s nest in Brussels for their spectacularly bad judgment which resulted in harmful consequences?\nIf we can’t make even the perpetrators of the COVID fiasco walk the plank, what hope is there for reining in any abuse at any governmental level in the future? Rewarding malfeasance with an expanded grant of authority is suicidally stupid.Published in\nGeneral",

Denuncian presencia de talamontes y ganaderos Indicaron que las tierras donde las magueyeras prentenden instalarse le pertenecen a los Bienes Comunales de los zoques de San Miguel Chimalapa, por lo que continuarán defendiendo esta zona, tal y como lo hicieron contras las empresas mineras. Además de esta incursión en la zona límitrofe, los comuneros zoques adelantaron que también iniciarán acciones concretas, para la recuperación de los 13 mil 500 hetáras de tierra de colindancia con la comunidad de Santiago Niltepec, Oaxaca. Denunciaron que en ambas franjas de tierras, existen ganaderos y talamontes que se encuentran explotando los recursos naturales de este territorio perteneciente a Los Chimalapas. ¿Qué han dicho las autoridades sobre la problemática? Luego de llevar a cabo una asamblea en el lugar donde habitan unas 40 familias zoques, los comuneros regresaron a la cabecera municipal, para reorganizar las acciones para hacer la brecha en el mes de mazo próximo. En el 2021, la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN), resolvió a favor de Oaxaca más de 84 mil hectáreas de selva, que se disputaba con el vecino estado de Chiapas, donde actualmente se encuentran asentadas comunidades de indígenas chiapanecos. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha no se ha iniciado el brecheo, para la delimitación de esas tierras a pesar del fallo a favor de los indígenas de Oaxaca.",

    "title": "NUEVE AÑOS FUGADO | El fugitivo que fue descubierto por el Predictor",
    "text": "Llevaban años buscando a Antonio. Desde 2015, cuando dejó sangrando y medio muerto a un hombre en una calle de Madrid. Ambos habían tenido una discusión de tráfico y Antonio le apuñaló varias veces con una daga antes de huir. Tenía 18 años y los policías ya le buscaban también por tráfico de drogas y conducción temeraria. Incluso por un delito de maltrato animal. Pasaron los meses, los años, y no había rastro de él. Había dejado a su novia y no estaba dentro del sistema oficial: no trabajaba, no cobraba ningún tipo de subsidio, no renovó el DNI, no iba al médico, no tenía nada a su nombre, sus familiares no le enviaban dinero a ningún lado. Se había esfumado. En 2021 llegó la primera pista fiable sobre su paradero. Los investigadores del Grupo de Localización de Fugitivos de la Policía Nacional vieron a un familiar del fugitivo con un carrito de bebé dentro del coche. Siguieron el hilo y supieron también que el fugitivo podía tener una nueva novia, y que esa chica, madrileña, su supuesta nueva pareja, había sido madre. Los investigadores creen que el fugitivo está oculto en algún lugar de la Comunidad de Madrid, cerca de su pareja y de su hijo recién nacido, pero no logran dar con él. Siguieron buscándole. Uno de los policías lo resumía así: \\\"Nadie se queda embarazada por el Espíritu Santo\\\". Investigan entonces si la abuela ayudaba de alguna manera a su hijo y a su nieto. La mujer, en su día, había convencido a la jueza para que dejara unos días en libertad a su Antonio. Le prometió que se presentaría luego para cumplir con la justicia. Nunca lo hizo. A finales de 2023, una nueva pista vincula a la madre con el pueblo de Miajadas, al sur de la provincia de Cáceres, a casi 300 kilómetros de Madrid. Los policías acuden sobre el terreno. Es un pueblo pequeño, no llega a diez mil habitantes. Ven allí a la pareja del fugado y, de nuevo, la ven con otro carrito de bebé. La siguen por el pueblo y también por las redes sociales. Han visto cómo ha colgado una fotografía de un Predictor, un test de embarazo, con dos rayitas de color rosa. La joven está embarazada de nuevo y lo anuncia a sus seres queridos. Esta vez tampoco puede haber sido el Espíritu Santo, pero los investigadores creen que es el momento. La mujer, embarazada de nuevo, puede llevarles hasta su pareja, el fugitivo. La joven acude al juzgado en Madrid, también a varias citas médicas para controlar su embarazo y ver que todo va bien. En ocasiones lo hace acompañada, pero nunca por el padre de las criaturas. Ni en la ecografía, ni durante el parto. Pero después de ser madre por segunda vez, la mujer vuelve de nuevo a Miajadas. Allí, en una casa baja de la calle Maura, hay un inquilino misterioso, un hombre que apenas se asoma a la calle. Los investigadores llevan meses vigilando. Cuando el hombre sale, deja la puerta entreabierta, para volver rápido. Siempre lleva gorra, gafas y barba. Es Antonio, el fugitivo desde 2015. Cuando huyó de la justicia tenía 18 años; ahora tiene 27 y es padre de dos hijos. Hacia las siete de la mañana del 20 de junio, alguien irrumpe en la casa de la calle Maura, en Miajadas. No es el Espíritu Santo. Son policías del Grupo de Fugitivos, de Cáceres y de la Unidad de Intervención (UIP). Ponen con rapidez los grilletes a Antonio y se lo llevan para tratar de evitar que su mujer y sus hijos sean testigos de ese momento tan violento.",
