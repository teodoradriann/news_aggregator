    "text": "The\nCape Cod National Seashore, like many national parks all across the country, is facing staff cuts as the Trump administration fires thousands of federal workers.\nThree full-time workers at the national seashore — the park archeologist, ecologist and the ranger in charge of park outreach — have been fired ahead of the Cape’s busy season as millions of visitors descend upon the region.\nThese three probationary employees are among the 1,000 National Park Service workers who were let go by the Trump administration.\nMeanwhile, there are 10 other vacant positions at the national seashore that likely won’t get filled, and advocates say they’re worried about the ability to hire seasonal staff members.\n“The Friends are deeply concerned about the impact the firings as well as vacant fulltime positions will have on the park, the towns that are part of the park, and the Cape Cod community from the bridges to Provincetown,” the board of\nThe Friends of the Cape Cod National Seashore said in a statement.\n“The unprecedented terminations of staff working for the National Park Service threatens the health and safety of our own beloved National Seashore,” the board added. “The cuts may do great harm to this remarkable natural and cultural resource in the coming months and years, affecting not only the park but also our region.”\nThe National Parks Conservation Association is calling for the 1,000 probationary workers to get their jobs back.\n“This is their dream job,” said Kristen Sykes, the Northeast regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association, noting that many of the employees worked for years as seasonal staff at parks all over the country before getting a full-time position.\n“They’re experts in their field, and make sure the parks are protected in perpetuity,” she told the Herald.\nThe advocacy group is also concerned about the parks’ ability to hire seasonal staff, particularly at the Cape.\n“Seasonal workers do so many different jobs, whether it’s cleaning the bathrooms, whether it’s making sure people are safe as lifeguards ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of parkgoers,” Sykes said.\n“We’re really concerned about the lack of staffing, and really for people to be able to have a good experience when they visit our National Parks,” she added.\nA National Park Service spokesperson didn’t comment on the Cape Cod layoffs.\nThe spokesperson in a statement said NPS is hiring seasonal workers to “continue enhancing the visitor experience as we embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation in workforce management.”\n“We are focused on ensuring that every visitor has the chance to explore and connect with the incredible, iconic spaces of our national parks,” the spokesperson added.\nThe Trump administration has been terminating thousands of federal workers.\nThe plan is led by billionaire Elon Musk and the new Department of Government Efficiency, a Trump administration effort to slash federal spending.\nHerald wire services were used in this report.",

    "text": "UA Board of Trustees approves design for new Alabama basketball practice facility\nThe UA System Board of Trustees voted to approve Stage III and Stage IV of the creation of Alabama basketball’s new practice facility on Thursday afternoon.\nThe vote approved the reallocation of the project budget and the proposed architectural design, as well as authorized the execution of a construction contract for the project. Below are some renderings revealed at the meeting of the proposed outside design of the facility, which will be both an expansion onto Coleman Coliseum as well as a renovation of existing space inside the facility.\nThe project has a total price tag of $58,674,625, unchanged from when the project was first announced and approved in June. The funding will come from future general revenue bonds ($36,949,625), crimson standard cash ($20,000,000) and university central reserves ($1,725,000), per the reallocated budget. Civilcon, LLC was announced as the company with the winning bid to take on the project, which will have a construction cost of $724 per square foot.\nThe 48,000 square foot expansion to the southeast corner of Coleman Coliseum and renovation of 19,000 square feet of existing space will add a new practice facility and weight room for the men’s basketball team, while renovating the existing practice facility to be taken over by the women’s team. The project will also include new sports medicine spaces, film and team meeting rooms, locker rooms, lounges, and coaching staff areas.\n“Coach [Nate] Oats and Coach [Kristy] Curry are extremely supportive of this plan as a positive and valuable next step for their respective teams, and they’ve both expressed this is the highest priority at this time and the facility will meet an immediate need as we continue to work towards long-term priorities for our basketball programs,” Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne said when the project was initially approved in June.",

    "title": "Kitchener man sent to prison for failed ‘suicide by cop’",
    "text": "A young Kitchener man who attempted “suicide by cop” while armed with a butcher knife has been sent to prison for 30 months. “The situation created not only a terrifying and life-changing experience for (the officer), it significantly endangered the community given the presence of others in the area where this took place,” Justice Melanie Sopinka said Thursday. The Waterloo Regional Police officer fired nine shots, striking the 19-year-old once in the left arm and once in both legs. “Shoot me, kill me,” the man repeatedly told the officer while holding a knife with a 30-centimetre (12-inch) blade. The man walked quickly toward the officer, who drew his firearm and told him to drop the knife. He refused. “Don’t do this,” the officer told him. “I have three kids. Don’t make me do this, please.” The man continued to advance, even after he had been shot. It happened on the night of Aug. 18, 2021, in the parking lot of a Zehrs supermarket in the Laurentian Power Centre on Ottawa Street South in Kitchener. “The events present a chilling landscape of (the officer) making impossible choices to protect his own life and the safety of members of the public who were actively observing the situation unfold,” the judge said. In a victim impact statement, the officer wrote that the night “changed his life forever,” Sopinka said. “He found himself crying for no reason, unable to stay in a store due to the noise and number of people, unable to rest, being constantly fearful for the safety of his family and experiencing constant sadness and diminished self-worth,” she said. A video of the shooting appeared on social media. Some called the officer a racist. He is white; the man he shot is Black. The officer “indicated that the existence of the video online exacerbated his vulnerability and that the worst day of his life would live forever,” the judge said. The man with the knife apologized in the hospital. “I want to tell him I’m sorry,” he told an officer. “I didn’t want to hurt him. I just wanted him to shoot me.” The man, who has no prior record, pleaded guilty to assault with a weapon. Crown prosecutor Brendan Thomas sought three years in prison. Defence lawyer Nick Gehl asked for a conditional discharge or house arrest. The Special Investigations Unit concluded the officer used reasonable force. The man gave “every indication that he was intent on attacking the officer,” the SIU said. “Though faced with an individual brandishing a knife in his direction, the officer had initially attempted to de-escalate the situation.” The man “ignored the officer’s entreaties and walked quickly and deliberately at the officer, holding the knife in his right hand,” the SIU said. The officer fired the first shot when the man was “clearly within striking distance … in a position to inflict grievous bodily harm or death,” it said. “The officer next fired — another single round — as the (man) rose to his feet and ran in his direction, again nearing to within striking distance. The final seven shots all occurred as the (man), again on his feet with the knife still in his right hand, charged at (him) as the officer retreated.” After the final shot, the officer lost his footing, fell and dropped the firearm. The man “retrieved the firearm momentarily before it fell free from his hold as he was physically engaged from behind” by the officer, the SIU said. “The two struggled for a period of time as other officers arrived at the scene and intervened to take the (man) into custody.” After the shooting, the man, now 21, was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. “It is clear that mental health issues dictated (his) actions as he was plagued by daily thoughts of suicide culminating in his decision on Aug. 18, 2021, to end his own life at the hands of the police,” Sopinka said. Before the “suicide by cop” attempt, he was told how to access supports in the community but did not take advantage of them, the judge said. After he was shot, he took 14 counselling sessions and decided he did not need medication or ongoing psychiatric care, despite professional advice to the contrary.
