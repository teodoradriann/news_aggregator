    "title": "Arsenal denied return to Premier League summit after West Ham defeat",
    "text": "ARSENAL MISSED THE chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.\nThe Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.\nHis West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\nA second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.\nMoyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.\nArsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.\nInstead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.\nArsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.\nBut at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.\nJarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback.\nArsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.\nPaqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.\nThe hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.\nFormer West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.\nMavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.\nJesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.\nAreola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.\nRice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",

Kurz vor dem Start brennt es plötzlich auf dem Festivalgelände.\nZwei Tage vor Beginn des Elektrofestivals Tomorrowland im belgischen Boom ist auf der Hauptbühne ein Feuer ausgebrochen. Bisher gebe es keine Verletzten, sagte eine Sprecherin der Feuerwehr. Wie die belgische Nachrichtenagentur Belga berichtete, sind Rettungsdienste vor Ort. Der Schwerpunkt liege derzeit auf der Sicherheit der anwesenden Mitarbeiter.\nTomorrowland-Festival soll dennoch stattfinden\nDie Veranstalter bestätigten in einer Mitteilung, dass die Hauptbühne schwer beschädigt sei. Das Festival soll einer Sprecherin zufolge dennoch stattfinden, allerdings ohne die Hauptbühne. Nähere Details nannte sie bei der Pressekonferenz zunächst nicht.\nExterner Inhalt\nBilder zeigen eine dichte Rauchwolke und Feuer. Auf einigen Clips in sozialen Netzwerken sind Feuerwerkskörper zu hören, die scheinbar unkontrolliert explodierten. Von der einst kunstvoll mit Bergwelt und Steinskulpturen gestalteten Hauptbühne ist nicht mehr viel übrig.\nDas Tomorrowland ist mit mehreren hunderttausend Besuchern eines der größten Elektrofestivals weltweit. Die diesjährige Ausgabe steht unter dem Motto \"Orbyz\" und soll nach früheren Angaben an zwei Wochenenden (18. bis 20. und 25.–27. Juli) stattfinden.\nGeplant sind über 600 Auftritte auf 16 Bühnen, unter anderem von Martin Garrix, David Guetta, Armin van Buuren, Charlotte de Witte und Swedish House Mafia. Die Stadt Boom liegt zwischen Brüssel und Antwerpen.",

    "title": "Second Iowa football OL confirms return to Hawkeyes in 2025",
    "text": "Redshirt junior Gennings Dunker is returning to the Iowa Hawkeyes for the 2025 season.\nIowa’s mainstay at right tackle over the past two seasons, Dunker confirmed that he would be back in the black and gold for the 2025 campaign after one of the Hawkeyes’ final practices before the Music City Bowl against Missouri on Monday.\nDunker said he never truly considered entering his name into the 2025 NFL draft.\n“I was just going to come back and plug into coach Ferentz and coach Barnett,” Dunker said on Thursday.\nThe 6-foot-5, 316 pound offensive lineman started 10 games for Iowa at right tackle this season before missing the final two regular season games due to injury. Dunker started all 13 games of the 2023 season at right tackle as well.\nDunker said his trust in Iowa head football coach Kirk Ferentz and in Iowa offensive line coach George Barnett were key factors in his decision to return to the Hawkeyes and ignore any possibilities elsewhere that the transfer portal might have presented.\n“Yeah, I’ve been trusting him for how long, four years. Even if I had heard certain things about different money options or whatever, I would’ve stuck with him because I’ve trusted him for this long, so why not keep trusting him.\n“It’s kind of an honor that I get to play for him, especially playing for coach Ferentz. So, that’s definitely kind of what means the most to me playing next year and even this game,” Dunker said.\nA native of Lena, Ill., Dunker was a big part of helping the Hawkeyes to the Joe Moore Award midseason honor roll and in paving the way for junior running back Kaleb Johnson’s breakout season.\nAsked where he has improved the most in 2024, Dunker pointed to the fluidity with and trust in his fundamentals.\n“The biggest thing I probably learned was just smoothness within blocking, whether it be run or pass blocking. Just being kind of calm with all the fundamentals and smooth through your blocking, if that makes sense. I don’t know if I’m explaining that very well. That’s kind of how I see it, smoothness in your play,” Dunker said.\nDunker knows there’s still plenty of room for growth, though.\n“There’s definitely a lot of areas for improvement for me personally. When I’m watching film, I see a lot of things I should have done better and things I want to improve on. That gives me a lot of things to work on for Monday and even next season and spring ball,” Dunker said.\nWhile there is an opportunity to shift over to the left side with longtime starting left tackle Mason Richman moving on after the Music City Bowl, Dunker is planning on staying put on the right side in 2025.\n“I’ll probably stay at right tackle just because I don’t know if I can get in a left-handed stance. I don’t know if I’m athletically gifted enough to do that, so I’ll probably just stay on the right side. I don’t want to mess with that,” Dunker said.\nDunker and Iowa (8-4, 6-3 Big Ten) close their 2024 season against Missouri (9-3, 5-3 SEC) on Monday at 1:30 p.m. CT from Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn. The Hawkeyes’ bowl contest will be televised on ESPN.\nContact/Follow us @HawkeyesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Iowa news, notes and opinions.\nFollow Josh on X: @JoshOnREF",

El frío ya es una constante desde hace días y se mantendrá durante este fin de semana, reforzado por la estabilidad del anticiclón. La previsión de MeteoGalicia para este viernes apunta a una jornada con cierta inestabilidad por la presencia de aire frío en capas altas de la atmósfera . Así, se espera una jornada que intercalará nubes y claros, pero no lloverá. El mercurio se moverá entre los siete grados de mínima y los 13 de máxima.\nEl sábado , la comarca irá caminando hacia la estabilidad del anticiclón, lo que dejará una jornada con cielos más despejados y un descenso de las temperaturas, que se situarán en los cuatro grados de mínima y los 14 de máxima.\nLa influencia de las altas presiones será máxima durante el domingo. Será un día de intenso sol y cielo azul. Las temperaturas, por su parte, se mantendrán similares a las del sábado. Esa situación se repetirá el lunes, pero con ascenso de las nieblas durante la tarde.",

    "title": "'Take humans out of dangerous equations': CU Boulder showcases its progress in robots",
    "text": "Spot is a a four-legged, dog-like robot at the University of Colorado Boulder originally designed for subterranean search and rescue. Meanwhile, another robotics team is developing a tiny insect-inspired robot that could someday serve the same search and rescue purpose.\nThese robots are two examples of projects on display during a robotics showcase at CU Boulder on Thursday.\n“The point of robotics is to try and take humans out of dangerous equations,” Robotics Lab Manager Destin Woods said. “For instance, in the (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) subterranean exploration, we have tried to get it to where Spot could go into dangerous situations that you don’t want a human going into. If a mine collapses or something, it collapses on a robot, not a human. Removing the human element of it is really the importance of this kind of work.”\nSpot the robot crashes the robotics showcase at the Sixth Annual Research and Innovation Week at the University of Colorado Boulder on Thursday. (Cliff Grassmick/Staff Photographer) Spot stands a few feet tall on four legs with a backpack containing cameras and other computer equipment. While Spot was originally designed for subterranean exploration, navigation and rescue attempts, Woods said, it now serves a broader purpose.\n“Basically, we query ChatGPT and ChatGPT can take the images that we’re getting from the robot,” Woods said.\nThis allows the robot to sense the environment it is in, like an office or lobby. It can be instructed to find an apple, for example, and it evaluates the environment it is in and knows how to look for a kitchen or café that might have an apple.\nWoods said creating robots like Spot can help solve more real-world problems. It could help obtain objects for people with mobility issues, and some versions can detect well-being in humans and could help respond in a medical emergency.\nNoah Liska, a CU Boulder senior, helped develop the code that runs a robot called the Franka Emika. It’s a robot with a long arm that can pick up objects and place them or push them in different spots.\nThe robot was created to automate certain processes of chemistry so chemists don’t have to return to their lab every few hours to perform simple tasks.\nLiska is excited by the potential for future uses. Similar robots are already being implemented in factories, and he hopes it could someday help retirement communities with assisted feeding, automated dressing or other tasks.\n“I think if we can prove that we can automate general chemistry tasks then we can automate a lot of menial tasks that do not need to be done (by a human),” Liska said.\nThe small-scale insect robot, mCLARI, can walk in different directions and change shape. Heiko Kabutz, a robotics doctoral student, helped design and build it.\n“It’s been really beautiful seeing the connection between biology and robotics and having that connection between seeing how excellent animals get through gaps and spaces and trying to implement some of those concepts in our robots to also squeeze through tighter spaces,” Kabutz said.\nBy using mCLARI, an engine in a plane could be inspected much more regularly, leading to safer air travel. The robot can explore underground tubes and tunnels and help with search and rescue in small spaces.\n“It allows the robots to squeeze through gaps where it previously couldn’t,” Kabutz said, adding, “Pretty much any application where you could send an insect in, now we have a controlled version of it.”\nThe next step in advancing the robot is to establish a more advanced body and leg control and bring the whole system closer to real-world application.",

    "text": "Android-Smartphones: Samsung enttäuscht im Ranking\nSamsung fällt im Leistungsvergleich der Smartphones im Juli zurück: Die Analysen einer Plattform offenbaren deutlich leistungsfähigere Konkurrenten.\nFrankfurt/Peking – Im aktuellsten Leistungsvergleich der schnellsten Android-Smartphones schneidet Samsung nicht gut ab. Ein Gaming-Handy führt die Rangliste der Plattform AnTuTu hingegen an. Das geht aus Juli-Daten des Anbieters, der den chinesischen Markt monatlich analysiert, hervor. Dabei fokussiert dieser sich auf Smartphones mit dem Betriebssystem Android.\nWie eingangs erwähnt sicherte sich das Red Magic 10S Pro+, ein Smartphone, das laut chip.de in Gamingkreisen beliebt ist, den ersten Platz im AnTuTu-Ranking in China. Den zweiten Platz erhielt das Vivo X200 Ulta. Das erste Samsung-Smartphone rangiert hingegen erst auf Platz 10 der aktuellsten Version des Rankings.\nIm Vergleich: Das sind die schnellsten Android-Smartphones\nDas gesamte Ranking im kompakten Überblick:\nPlatzierung | Gerät |\n---|---|\n1 | Red Magic 10 Pro |\n2 | iQOO 13 |\n3 | vivo X200 Ultra |\n4 | OnePlus 13 |\n5 | Poco F7 Ultra |\n6 | Mi 15 Ultra |\n7 | vivo X200 Pro |\n8 | Mi 15 |\n9 | vivo X200 Pro mini |\n10 | Galaxy S25 Ultra |\nQuelle: antutu.com |\nBeim angesprochenen Samsung-Gerät handelt es sich um das Galaxy S25 Ultra. Laut Angaben von Jörn Schmidt, der regelmäßig auf seinem Blog schmidtisblog.de über die Thematik berichtet, brachte die Juli-Bewertung des Anbieters allerdings kaum Veränderungen auf den Spitzenplätzen – bereits zum dritten Mal in Folge. Demnach könnte jedoch im Herbst 2025 Bewegung in den Markt kommen, da neue Prozessoren der Anbieter MediaTek und Qualcomm erwartet werden. Diese könnten maßgebliche Auswirkungen beim Thema Schnelligkeit der Geräte haben.\nÜber die Plattform\nAnTuTu (chinesisch: 安兔兔) ist laut eigenen Angaben eine weit verbreitete Benchmark-Software zur Leistungsmessung von Smartphones und anderen Geräten. Die Plattform wurde im Januar 2011 als Android-Benchmark-Anwendung gestartet.\nDie Rangliste des Anbieters basiert auf Durchschnittswerten von Benchmarks, die wiederum nützliche Nutzerstatistiken mit mindestens 1000 gültigen Ergebnissen im jeweiligen Monaten abbilden – im aktuellen Fall aus dem Juli 2025.\nInwiefern die Ergebnisse des Rankings zum chinesischen Markt auf den deutschen Markt übertragbar sind, muss allerdings kritisch hinterfragt werden.\nTipps und Tricks: Wird Ihr Android-Smartphone langsamer?\nMit der Nutzungszeit nimmt die Geschwindigkeit vieler Smartphones, die Android als Betriebssystem nutzen, ab – völlig unabhängig vom Gerät. Vielfach kann dieser Entwicklung jedoch entgegengewirkt werden. Folgende Tipps können laut dem Portal giga.de offenbar helfen:\n- Deaktivieren Sie Animationen: Unter dem Puntk „Eingabehilfen“ können im Menü Animationen ausgeschaltet werden. Auf diese Weise wird Rechenleistung gespart, vor allem beim Wechseln und Öffnen von Fenstern.\n- Leeren Sie Ihren Cache: Der Cache von Apps kann demnach problemlos geleert werden, um Speicherplatz freizugeben – ganz im Gegenteil zum Cache von Browsern, die wichtige Daten für Websites, die alltäglich angesteuert werden, liefern.\n- Schränken Sie Hintergrundprozesse ein: Apps, die dauerhaft im Hintergrund laufen, können problemlos entfernt werden.\n- Entfernen Sie Bloatware: Sogenannte Bloatware ist meist vorinstalliert und belegt Speicherplatz. Vielfach ist sie aber nicht notwendig und kann deinstalliert werden.\n(tu) Verwendete Quellen: antutu.com, chip.de, schmidtisblog.de, giga.de",

    "title": "CFTC seeks Coinbase user data in Polymarket probe",
    "text": "Coinbase has reportedly received a subpoena from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as part of its investigation into the crypto prediction market platform Polymarket.\nThe subpoena was disclosed in a customer notice dated January 8 and shared on X by EthHub co-founder Eric Conner. It seeks general customer information, including details related to specific user accounts.\nThe notice informed customers that Coinbase “may be required” to provide user account data to the CFTC unless legally prevented by a motion to quash or another filing submitted by January 15, 2025. Coinbase clarified that no immediate action was required from users.\nThis development follows heightened scrutiny of Polymarket, which operates a decentralized prediction market platform. In November 2024, the FBI raided the home of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan amid concerns around the platform’s compliance with regulatory standards.\nThe raid came shortly after Republican Donald Trump’s November 5 presidential election victory, which reportedly resulted in millions of dollars in winnings for cryptocurrency investors betting on his success through Polymarket. At the time, a Polymarket spokesperson labeled it as “political retribution” by the Biden administration for hosting a platform that allegedly “correctly called” the recent U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.\nInternational regulators have also taken an interest in Polymarket’s operations. France’s gaming authority launched an investigation in November 2024 to assess the platform’s compliance with gambling laws.\nPolymarket processed $3.7 billion in bets on its “Presidential Election Winner 2024” market, drawing criticism over its influence on the election narrative. Although U.S. residents are officially prohibited from placing bets on the platform, some have reportedly used VPNs to bypass restrictions. Ahead of the election, Polymarket was verifying that major bettors were overseas-based, as U.S. law restricts such activities.\nIn early 2022, Polymarket settled a $1.4 million fine with the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for offering unregistered event-based binary options. The FBI has yet to make any formal arrests or charges, while Coplan and Polymarket await further developments.\nPolymarket’s election odds, which have increasingly favored former President Donald Trump since early October, are consistent with those on other platforms, the company said. The sharp rise in Trump’s odds followed months of close competition with Vice President Kamala Harris , who maintained a lead earlier in the year.",
