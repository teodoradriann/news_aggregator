    "text": "Joseph Parker celebrates his unanimous points win over Deontay Wilder in Riyadh\nJoseph Parker has ‘earned’ a rematch with Anthony Joshua, but the British star may avoid this ‘high risk’ fight, says the New Zealander’s promoter David Higgins.\nParker wrecked plans for a long-awaited showdown between Joshua and Deontay Wilder in 2024 as he sealed a unanimous decision win over the American in Saudi Arabia last weekend.\nJoshua defeated Parker on points to unify the WBO, WBA and IBF belts in Cardiff in 2018, but Higgins hopes to see a second fight in the near future.\nAnthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder in talks for two-fight dealDeontay Wilder: Anthony Joshua fight is the closest it’s ever beenNOW Sports Month Membership: £21 a month for 6 months\n“Joseph has earned that fight in my opinion and the Saudis would see merit in Parker against Anthony Joshua,” Parker’s promoter David Higgins told Sky Sports.\n“It might not be next, there might be a bit more work to do but I think that’s the fight fans want to see. It’s a merit-based fight.\n“In terms of opponents, Joseph will fight anyone and if you look at all the names on his resume from Derek Chisora twice, Joe Joyce, Joshua, Wilder, Dillian Whyte, the list goes on and he’s still only 31-years-old.\n“We’ll fight Anthony Joshua in a heartbeat. Everyone knows Joseph will fight him next but I am not sure that’s an option. We’ll obviously look at any option and see what comes forward.\n“I can’t speak for their [Anthony Joshua] team, but they are probably trying to rebuild to a point and have a big fight against the likes of Tyson Fury or Oleksandr Usyk.”\nHiggins added: “Maybe Joseph, especially after the way he handled his business with Wilder, is probably seen as high risk.”\nFollowing his victory, Parker extended his thanks to Fury, who had shared the ring on three occasions with Wilder, and assisted with preparations.\n“I think Tyson was very influential in creating the opportunity and helping Joseph by letting him use the gym, and I know they have done some sparring together as well,” Higgins said.\n“You can’t get better sparring than Fury, the lineal heavyweight champion, it was very helpful.”\nHiggins believes Parker produced a career-best win over Wilder and also praised trainer Andy Lee for devising the winning gameplan.\n“For me, it was the best performance of Joseph’s career,” Higgins said.\n“The reason I say that is because those massive, global, pay-per-view fights have a special pressure about them, the eyes of the world are upon you and against his opponent, a murderous puncher, one of the most feared in history, you can’t really describe what that pressure is like until you’ve been in that situation.\n“A couple of times he came up short [in his career], but this time he maintained a cool head, was patient, showed intent, stuck to the fight plan, withstood the pressure. He didn’t just win but dominated Wilder.”\nParker has fought four times in this calendar year and his consistency has allowed him to gather momentum with Higgins hoping he can fight again in March.\n“I think we’ll look at every option and Joseph wants to be busy and he’s looked at his best fighting regularly,” Higgins said.\n“He’s got some momentum going so the intent is to continue. We don’t want to step backward to weaker opponents. We want to keep the level up and keep busy.\n“If he can fight again in March, he’ll be grateful to everyone who has helped facilitate that.”\nParker would also welcome a future fight with unified champion Oleksandr Usyk, who defends his WBO, IBF and WBA belts against WBC champion Fury in an undisputed title fight in Saudi Arabia on February 17.\n“If the fight came up, I’m sure Joseph would jump at the opportunity, it would be a great fight and yes I think he could win the fight.” Higgins said.\n“He [Parker] is feeling satisfied with it all coming together, a complete performance under the highest pressure, he deserves to be proud.\n“His doubters and the people writing him off, he’s certainly shut that crowd up. In New Zealand, the leading newspapers said he is back and he’s got another run at a world title.”\nParker troubled Wilder with a fierce attack as he pulled ahead on the scorecards\nThe 31-year-old stuck to the gameplan which had been devised by trainer Andy Lee\nParker sealed a unanimous decision win over Deontay Wilder\nParker is working towards a rematch with Anthony Joshua",

    "title": "OpenAI worries people may become emotionally reliant on its new ChatGPT voice mode | Technology | koamnewsnow.com",
    "text": "New York (CNN) — OpenAI is worried that people might start to rely on ChatGPT too much for companionship, potentially leading to “dependence,” because of its new human-sounding voice mode . That revelation came in a report Thursday from OpenAI on the safety review it conducted of the tool — which began rolling out to paid users last week — and the large language AI model it runs on. ChatGPT’s advanced voice mode sounds remarkably lifelike. It responds in real time, can adjust to being interrupted, makes the kinds of noises that humans make during conversations like laughing or “hmms.” It can also judge a speaker’s emotional state based on their tone of voice. Within minutes of OpenAI announcing the feature at an event earlier this year, it was being compared to the AI digital assistant in the 2013 film “Her,” with whom the protagonist falls in love, only to be left heartbroken when the AI admits “she” also has relationships with hundreds of other users. Now, OpenAI is apparently concerned that fictional story is a little too close to becoming reality, after it says it observed users talking to ChatGPT’s voice mode in language “expressing shared bonds” with the tool. Eventually, “users might form social relationships with the AI, reducing their need for human interaction — potentially benefiting lonely individuals but possibly affecting healthy relationships,” the report states. It adds that hearing information from a bot that sounds like a human could lead users to trust the tool more than they should, given AI’s propensity to get things wrong . The report underscores a big-picture risk surrounding artificial intelligence: tech companies are racing to quickly roll out to the public AI tools that they say could upend the way we live, work, socialize and find information. But they’re doing so before anyone really understands what those implications are. As with many tech advancements, companies often have one idea of how their tools can and should be used, but users come up with a whole host of other potential applications, often with unintended consequences. Some people are already forming what they describe as romantic relationships with AI chatbots, prompting concern from relationship experts. “It’s a lot of responsibility on companies to really navigate this in an ethical and responsible way, and it’s all in an experimentation phase right now,” Liesel Sharabi, an Arizona State University Professor who studies technology and human communication, told CNN in an interview in June. “I do worry about people who are forming really deep connections with a technology that might not exist in the long-run and that is constantly evolving.” OpenAI said that human users’ interactions with ChatGPT’s voice mode could also, over time, influence what’s considered normal in social interactions. “Our models are deferential, allowing users to interrupt and ‘take the mic’ at any time, which, while expected for an AI, would be anti-normative in human interactions,” the company said in the report. For now, OpenAI says it’s committed to building AI “safely,” and plans to continue studying the potential for “emotional reliance” by users on its tools.

    "text": "MADRID, 13 (EUROPA PRESS)\nEl frío, las olas y el viento pondrán este sábado en aviso a seis provincias en un día en el que la peor parte se la llevará El Hierro (Canarias), con aviso naranja por viento, según la predicción de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET).\nLa mitad de las provincias afectadas lo estarán por avisos por bajas temperaturas: Huesca (Aragón), León (Castilla y León) y Lleida (Cataluña), todas con -6º C. Por lo demás, habrá avisos por oleaje en Girona (Cataluña); y por rachas de viento ambién en La Palma, La Gomera y Tenerife (Canarias).\nEn líneas generales, AEMET prevé un día marcado por el anticiclón en la Península y Baleares, con predominio de cielos poco nubosos o con intervalos de nubes altas. La excepción estará en áreas del extremo norte peninsular, donde se prevé un ambiente más nuboso, con precipitaciones que afectarán al Cantábrico oriental y Pirineos.\nEl organismo estatal no descarta que caigan precipitaciones en otros puntos del Cantábrico, oeste de Galicia, nordeste de Cataluña o norte de Baleares. Asimismo, señala que podría caer algún chubasco a primeras horas en Huelva. A partir de los 1.000/1.200 metros se esperan en forma de nieve.\nPor otro lado, la predicción recoge que habrá nubosidad baja matinal, con probables nieblas, que afectarán a zonas de ambas mesetas y depresiones del nordeste. Mientras, en Canarias, se pronostica abundante nubosidad de tipo medio y alto que tenderá a más a lo largo del día y dejará probables chubascos en las islas de mayor relieve al final, cuando también se prevé la entrada de calima ligera.\nEn lo que respecta a las temperaturas, las máximas estarán en aumento, con ligeras subidas en la Península y Baleares y moderados incrementos en Canarias. Por otra parte, bajarán en el nordeste peninsular. A su vez, las mínimas estarán en aumento en los archipiélagos y en descenso en el resto.\nDurante el sábado, se registrarán heladas débiles en la mayor parte de zonas de interior de la mitad norte peninsular, este de la meseta sur y sierras del sureste, y llegarán a fuertes en montañas del extremo norte. Las capitales de provincia que registrarán valores más bajos serán León con -4ºC; Ávila, Palencia y Soria con -3ºC; y Burgos, Cuenca, Lugo, Segovia, Valladolid y Zamora con -2ºC.\nAEMET avanza que este sábado soplarán vientos del este y sureste en Canarias con intervalos fuerte y rachas muy fuertes en las islas occidentales. A su vez, también predominarán los vientos de componente este, pero en general flojos, en el sur peninsular; mientras que lo harán los de componentes oeste y norte, flojos, en el resto. Se prevén más intensos en el Estrecho, Cantábrico, Ebro, Baleares y Ampurdán, donde podrían darse intervalos de tramontana fuerte al final.",
