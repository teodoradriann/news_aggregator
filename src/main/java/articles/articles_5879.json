    "text": "Deployed U.S. Army soldiers will no longer be able to store their belongings free of charge while they are away from home, the Army Sustainment Command announced Wednesday.\nA spokesman for the command, which is the primary provider of logistics support to Army units, told Military.com that it was discontinuing the use of funds to store soldiers’ vehicles and other goods while they are away for prolonged periods of time.\nThe storage policy ended in October, but the order was not “widely distributed” to soldiers or the press, the outlet reported.\n“We understand the burden this could potentially place on soldiers, and HQDA G-1 [The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Department of the Army] is drafting policy that would enable such storage,” service spokesman Sgt. Pablo Saez said.\nIt is unclear when or in what manner that future policy will take form.\nAn internal memo from Col. Heather Carlisle, director for support operations at the Army Sustainment Command, said that the Army is not required to provide storage for its soldiers:\nHQDA G1, the proponent for [storage] entitlements, recently determined that the Army would no longer support [storage] entitlements because there is no Army policy explicitly authorizing storage in support of soldiers deployed for contingency operations.\nFollowing the discontinuation of the storage program, members of the Army have been authorized to store their vehicles in motor pools, which are typically used to house tactical vehicles and “frequently are uncovered or not climate controlled,” according to the outlet.\nThe post U.S. Army Ends Free Storage of Vehicles, Belongings for Deployed Soldiers appeared first on Breitbart .",

    "title": "Queensland among several states offering rebates of up to $6000 on purchases of electric vehicles | 7NEWS",
    "text": "Despite Electric Vehicles (EVs) becoming more prevalent on our roads, for many Australians the price tag still remains much too high, particularly given the current cost-of-living climate. But in a bid to persuade more motorists to purchase the EVs, which offer a host of financial and environmental benefits, some states are offering big rebates to make the vehicles more financially attractive. Below is a list of the current EV rebates being offered in each state: Know the news with the 7NEWS app: [Download today ](https://7news.com.au/app?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link-app&utm_campaign=7news-app) Queensland Queensland’s Zero Emission Vehicle Rebate Scheme offers up to $6000 for residents who purchase a new EV. To be eligible, the EV cannot be worth more than $68,000, and it had to have been purchased on or after April 21, 2023. The person purchasing the car must also have an annual total household taxable income equal to or less than $180,000. The rebate also applies to cars worth up to $58,000 purchased between March 16, 2022 and April 20, 2023, with a total household taxable income equal to or less than $180,000 a year. A $3000 rebate is available for EVs worth up to $68,000 bought on or after April 21, 2023 or EVs valued up to $58,000 bought between March 16, 2022 and April 20, 2023. Queensland businesses are ineligible to receive the $6000 rebate but may still be eligible for the $3000 rebate. More information can be found on the Queensland Government’s [website](https://www.qrida.qld.gov.au/program/queensland-zero-emission-vehicle-rebate-scheme). Victoria In Victoria, vehicles classified as ZLEVs — low-emissions cars that require electrical plug-in to recharge — receive $100 off their [annual registration](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/registration/registration-fees/concessions-and-discounts/hybrid-vehicle-registration-discount). The state government did offer a $3000 rebate on eligible EVs with a retail price up to $68,740 however it was scrapped in June 2023 as part of cost-cutting measures. New South Wales New South Wales also once offered a $3000 rebate on eligible EVs less than $68,750 however the incentive ended in December 2023. Instead, the state government promised to invest an additional $260 million into EV charging infrastructure. South Australia The South Australian Government axed its $3000 EV rebate at the start of 2024 however a three-year registration exemption for electric vehicles still remains. New battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles registered worth up to $68,750 and registered from October 28, 2021 to June 30, 2025 are eligible. The exemption applies for three years from the date the vehicle is first registered. For more information, visit the state’s Department of Treasury and Finance [website](https://www.treasury.sa.gov.au/Growing-South-Australia/incentives-for-electric-vehicles). Western Australia Residents in WA can receive a $3500 rebate under the [Government’s Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Rebate Scheme](https://www.transport.wa.gov.au/projects/zero-emission-vehicle-zev-rebate.asp). Zero emission vehicles that are fully powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells and are worth $70,000 or less are eligible. Hybrid vehicles are not entitled to the rebate. Since the introduction of the scheme in May 2022, almost 7000 rebates have been paid totalling $24,000,000 (as of May 31, 2024). Northern Territory Free registration and stamp duty concessions for eligible plug-in electric vehicles are [available for NT residents](https://nt.gov.au/driving/rego/getting-an-nt-registration/get-electric-vehicle-registration-and-stamp-duty-concessions). For electric vehicles valued up to $50,000, a stamp duty concession of up to $1500 is on offer. Battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are eligible. Australian Capital Territory Lower registration fees are available for some low-emissions vehicles in the ACT. Certain electric vehicles also receive a stamp duty exemption. Zero emissions vehicles were eligible for two years of free registration, however the incentive finished in June 2024. There are interest-free loans of up to $15,000 available for homeowners to purchase sustainable products for their home, including new and used zero emissions vehicles vehicle charging equipment. More details can be found on the [government’s website](https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/driving-transport-and-parking/registration/incentives-for-low-and-zero-emissions-vehicles). Tasmania Tasmania has an [Electric Vehicle Rebate program](https://www.recfit.tas.gov.au/what_is_recfit/climate_change/electric_vehicles/support?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3ODeJC3qj-0tAAfMFKQ_p2gCrZiLetcbP7QEtB9yJ2qkATWNLMSfub69g_aem_Bp97bTYoN6mAo_l-3pfA1w) which offers a limited number of rebates of $2000 for new battery electric vehicles and second-hand electric vehicles. The majority of the rebates have been reserved, however some funding is still available where applicants have taken too long to buy their cars (more than six months). The state government will allocate these rebates to another applicant. As of July 1, 2024 there are 28 rebates available. The rebates will be re-released at 11am every Tuesday until funding has been exhausted. Rebates are not guaranteed to everyone who applies. Stream free on",

    "text": "Sept. 13 (UPI) -- More than 30,000 Boeing workers will go on strike starting Friday after turning down a tentative contract proposal hammered out by the company and union negotiators.\nMembers of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted 94.6% to reject the agreement, while 96% voted in favor of a strike. Advertisement\n\"We strike at midnight,\" IAM District 751 President Jon Holden said at a press conference on Thursday.\nThe strike will shut down aircraft assembly at Boeing plants in Seattle, with stoppages also expected in Portland, Ore., and California. Related Thousands of hotel workers strike for better wages, fairer workloads Potential Canadian rail disruption might affect supply chains, prices British union ASLEF announces 22-day weekend strike for LNER rail line workers\nThe agreement put before workers would have increased wages by 25%, slashed employee contribution to health care costs and ensured that Boeing's next plane would be constructed at its union plants and not its non-union sites in South Carolina\nBut contract foes said raises of about 40% were needed along with updates to its pension plan. Boeing executives, though, claimed it was the best contract the company has ever offered a union.\nHolden called the stoppage an \"unfair labor practice strike,\" saying workers at the factories faced \"discriminatory conduct, coercive questioning, unlawful surveillance,\" adding that the union had received an \"unlawful promise of benefits.\" Advertisement\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who has been leading the company for less than two months, said a strike could hobble its recovery and called for the union to accept the deal.\n\"We have achieved everything we could in bargaining, short of a strike,\" Holden told members in a message before the voting. \"We recommended acceptance because we can't guarantee we can achieve more in a strike.\n\"But that is your decision to make and is a decision that we will protect and support, no matter what.\"",

    "title": "Kita-Kürzung: Stadt Groß-Gerau stoppt umstrittenes Projekt",
    "text": "Groß-Gerau hatte die Kita-Öffnungszeiten ab 1. August auf 7 bis 14.30 Uhr kürzen wollen. Nach einer denkwürdigen Sozialausschusssitzung ist nun klar: So schnell wird das nichts.\nGroß-Gerau. Die Stadt\nGroß-Gerau wird die Öffnungszeiten ihrer Kitas nun doch nicht ab 1. August 2025 auf den Zeitraum von 7 bis 14.30 Uhr verkürzen: In einer denkwürdigen Sitzung des Sozialausschusses am Dienstagabend in der Dornheimer Riedhalle samt massiven Problemen mit der Tontechnik zog Bürgermeister Jörg Rüddenklau (SPD) die Entwürfe für die neuen Kita-Satzungen zurück. Damit wird es zu Beginn des neuen Kita-Jahrs nicht zum Wegfall des Nachmittagsmoduls bis 16.30 Uhr kommen.\nÖffentlichkeit wird ausgeschlossen\nDiesem Schritt vorausgegangen war eine nicht-öffentliche Beratung, für die sich der Ausschuss mehrheitlich entschieden hatte. Gegen 19.40 Uhr mussten die rund 30 Zuschauer – darunter viele Eltern und Erzieherinnen –, Verwaltungsmitarbeiter und Presse den Saal verlassen. Aus der angedachten kurzen Beratung unter Ausschluss der Öffentlichkeit wurde eine gute halbe Stunde, an deren Ende die überraschende Wendung stand.\nJede Menge Änderungsanträge\nBereits zu Beginn der Sitzung war klar, dass es kompliziert würde. Daraus machte Ausschuss-Vorsitzender Bernd Wiederhold (Grüne) keinen Hehl. Nachdem es schon bei der\nVorstellung der neuen Satzungen – neben der Kita-Satzung ging es auch um Gebühren- und Elternbeiratssatzung – am 10. Juni jede Menge Nachfragen und Kritik gegeben hatte, lagen nun eine ganze Reihe an Änderungsanträgen vor, auch an den Satzungen selbst waren noch Anpassungen vorgenommen worden. Eine weitere Stellungnahme des Hessischen Städte- und Gemeindebunds (HSGB) war erst am Tag vor der Sitzung bei der Stadt eingegangen. Zudem gab es noch Fragen der Freien Wähler, der Stadtelternbeirat hatte schriftlich umfangreiche Anmerkungen vorgelegt.\nDie SPD wollte Abstand von einer einheitlichen zweiwöchigen Schließzeit für alle Kitas während der Sommerferien nehmen und eine Notbetreuung erhalten wissen, die CDU zielte auf Änderungen bei der Elternbeiratssatzung ab. Die Freien Wähler schließlich forderten gleich 15 Änderungen.\nFast 600 Kinder auf der Warteliste\nHintergrund der Satzungsanpassungen sind die geplanten Kürzungen der Kita-Zeiten im Zuge des Pilotprojekts Versorgungslage. In Groß-Gerau stehen fast 600 Kinder auf der Warteliste für einen Kitaplatz. Da nachmittags deutlich weniger Kinder betreut werden als am Vormittag, im Verhältnis dafür aber mehr Personal benötigt wird, geht die Verwaltung davon aus, durch kompaktere Öffnungszeiten und einen effizienteren Personaleinsatz mehr Kindern einen Platz anbieten zu können. Die Rede ist von rund 200 zusätzlichen Kindern, die mit dem vorhandenen Personal betreut werden könnten und schrittweise aufgenommen werden sollen.\nBei Vollauslastung böten die Groß-Gerauer Kitas 1.278 Plätze. Tatsächlich betreut wurden (Stand Anfang März) aber nur 784 Kinder. Dass so viele Plätze unbesetzt sind, obwohl der Bedarf besteht, liegt an fehlendem Personal. Im städtischen Haushalt sind zwar knapp 148 Erzieherstellen der Entgeltgruppe S8b verankert, doch waren davon zuletzt etwa 40 unbesetzt. Würde es gelingen, diese Mitarbeiter zu gewinnen, könnten nach Einschätzung der Verwaltung weitere 278 Kinder einen Platz erhalten.\nMit der Kita-Thematik haben sich Ausschüsse und Parlament in den vergangenen Wochen ausgiebig beschäftigt, auch über Anfangs- und Endzeiten für Kitas wurde diskutiert. Schließlich votierte die\nStadtverordnetenversammlung am 27. Mai mit den Stimmen von CDU, SPD und Grünen dafür, die Zeiten auf 7 bis 14.30 Uhr festzulegen. Die Rede war von einer Notsituation; man wisse, was dies für Eltern bedeute, die einen Nachmittagsplatz benötigten. Sobald sich die Lage bessere, wolle man zu längeren Öffnungszeiten zurückkehren.\nWeiter offene Fragen\nDie Frage der Freien Wähler, wie viele Kinder das Spätmodul in Anspruch nehmen, wurde von Kita-Amtsleiterin Isabel Lopez-Ruiz mit Verweis auf das individuelle Buchungsverhalten nicht eindeutig beantwortet. In einer früheren Sitzung hatte sie davon gesprochen, dass es in der Spitze bis zu 180 Kinder seien. Monika Freitagsmüller (Freie Wähler) wunderte sich, weshalb Groß-Gerau bei Kitakindern (drei bis sechs Jahre) mit einer Gruppengröße von 20 Kindern arbeite, während andere Kommunen im Kreis 25 ansetzten.\nFragen und Diskussionen wogten eine Zeit lang hin und her, teils wurden Formulierungen der Verwaltung als „unklar“ eingestuft. CDU-Fraktionschef Thomas Hlubek forderte, die Abstimmung zum SPD-Antrag zu Sommerschließzeiten ins Stadtparlament zu vertagen, weil die Fraktion dazu noch nicht habe beraten können. Dies wurde bei einer Enthaltung aus Reihen der SPD befürwortet. Peter Lohmar (Grüne) wies zudem darauf hin, dass Änderungen in der Präambel nicht weiterhelfen, weil die Satzung entscheidend sei.\nFreie Wähler: Sommerpause für Arbeit an Satzungen nutzen\nMonika Freitagsmüller ergriff dann das Wort und plädierte dafür, sich für die Satzungsänderungen über die Sommerpause Zeit zu nehmen. Bei einem Pilotprojekt sollten Rahmen, Bedingungen und Ziele klar definiert und erläutert werden, wie und durch wen die Evaluierung erfolge. Veränderungen der Öffnungszeiten könnten dann zum 1. Januar 2026 erfolgen. Unter Eltern herrsche derzeit große Verunsicherung vor, sie bräuchten Zeit, um veränderte Arbeitszeiten mit Arbeitgebern abstimmen zu können.\nZiel sei es, innerhalb von neun Monaten nach Projektstart eine Zahl von 998 betreuten Kindern zu erreichen. Klar definiert werden müsse, wann das Projekt als gescheitert und wann als gelungen gelte, führte Freitagsmüller aus.\nNeue Zeiten sollen später kommen\nAn ihren Beitrag schlossen sich die nicht-öffentliche Beratung und die Rücknahme der Satzungen durch Bürgermeister Rüddenklau an. Die Satzungen würden neu eingebracht, man wolle beim Pilotprojekt Versorgungslage schnell voranschreiten. „Gehen Sie davon aus, dass neue Öffnungszeiten kommen werden“, sagte er.",
