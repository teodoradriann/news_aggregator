Sobre os principais parceiros da UE, diz que relação com os Estados Unidos vai depender de quem ganhar eleições e que a China é “um parceiro incontornável”.

    "text": "[Política](/actualidad/politica/) El PSOE de Barbastro se opone al presupuesto del ayuntamiento El pleno municipal para aprobar los presupuestos de 2024 se celebra mañana viernes 29 de diciembre Barbastro Hoy el PSOE de Barbastro adelantaba en una rueda de Prensa que va a votar en contra de estos presupuestos. Ya que, como ha explicado el portavoz del grupo socialista, Daniel Gracia, no hay ningún proyecto de ciudad para Barbastro contemplado en ellos y además, achacaba al ayuntamiento de Barbastro la falta de control sobre los gastos corrientes, ya que en 2023 han estado sin presupuesto municipal. La evolución de los gastos corrientes, se ha disparado debido a la falta de gestión de los contratos de servicios caducados, al aumento de los costes de suministros por no llevar a cabo ninguna acción para reducirlos y al derroche e improvisación en el gasto. El aumento de los gastos, tiene como consecuencia que la diferencia entre ingresos y gastos a quedado reducida a la mínima expresión, con lo que las inversiones en presupuesto son prácticamente inexistentes. El portavoz del Grupo Municipal Socialista en el ayuntamiento de Barbastro, Daniel Gracia, mostraba su preocupación. “Los gastos han aumentado sin control, si seguimos así, el equipo de gobierno de PP y VOX, será recordado por la deriva a la que está llevando la ciudad”.",

    "title": "Government urged to implement Zero Emission Van Plan",
    "text": "The new transport secretary, Louise Haigh, is being encouraged to take action to boost electric van uptake by implementing measures outlined in the\nZero Emission Van Plan.\nIn a letter to Haigh, the coalition behind the plan is calling for improved charging infrastructure with van needs in mind, removal of regulatory barriers that are preventing operators from making the switch and increased fiscal support to make new and used e-vans affordable.\nSignatories to the letter include Stellantis and the\nFleet News Fleet200 Strategy Network, which represents some of the largest fleet operators in the UK.\nHaving\n launched in the Houses of Parliament in February earlier this year, the Zero Emission Van Plan is the output of widespread collaboration between the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), Logistics UK, Recharge UK, the Association of Fleet Professionals (AFP), and The EV Café.\nA spokesperson for the Zero Emission Van Plan, said: “Registrations for electric vans have stalled, from an already low starting point.\n“The ZEV mandate has been introduced to stimulate supply, but demand is lagging.\n“Van operators are struggling to make the transition work, facing barrier after barrier across vehicle quality, performance, cost, and charging infrastructure.\n“The Zero Emission Van Plan is clear. For the transition to work, we need increased fiscal support, improved charging and the removal of regulatory barriers.\n“We are calling on the new Government to take decisive action to make electric vans a realistic option for millions of drivers.”\nThe Zero Emission Van Plan coalition has also invited Haigh to visit a depot of an operator that has embraced electric vans, to enable the transport secretary to see the vehicles first hand and hear about the scale of the challenge to achieving widespread adoption.\nOne in ten workers - 3.4 million people - rely on a van for their jobs across a wide range of industries, from engineering and construction to emergency and rescue services.\nCommercial vehicles are the fastest-growing part of the vehicle parc. However, electric van registrations are faltering, with deliveries falling for a third month this year, down 16.8% on June last year,\naccording to the most recent figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\nSome 1,476 fully electric vans were registered in the month, meaning battery electric vans accounted for just 4.7% of all new light van registrations compared with 5.2% for the same period last year.\nWith manufacturers mandated to ensure zero emission vehicles comprise a minimum of 10% of their new van registrations this year, market share heading in the opposite direction is a cause for concern.",

    "text": "The Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia reopened Friday, two weeks after remnants of Hurricane Helene caused disastrous flooding in the Appalachian region. The parkway is now open from milepost 0 to milepost 198 in Virginia, which includes scenic views of Shenandoah National Park. “We are extremely thankful that much of the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia has reopened to the public following Hurricane Helene,” said Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia’s Blue Ridge. Howard noted that Roanoke, Salem and other nearby localities saw minimal storm damage. Fall foliage is anticipated to peak at the end of October, and Roanoke is an ideal place for those looking to explore the area, according to a release from Virginia’s Blue Ridge. The North Carolina stretch of the Blue Ridge Parkway remains closed. Crews continue emergency work to stabilize the road as they assess the damage. Hurricane Helene’s death toll has surpassed 200, making it the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Communities in western North Carolina are still reeling from damaged homes, washed-out river banks, knocked-out power and impassable roads.

    "text": "Among the star performers in Vietnam's agricultural export basket, durian has emerged as the \"king of fruits\". Preliminary estimates from the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetables Association (VINAFRUIT) indicate that durian exports reached US$2.5 billion in the first nine months of the year, surpassing the previous annual record of $2.24 billion set in 2023. General Secretary Dang Phuc Nguyen of the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetables Association forecasts that Vietnam's durian exports will exceed $3 billion this year. As the main harvest season commences in the Central Highlands in October, coupled with the off-season harvests in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam's durian supply will peak. Moreover, with competing producers like Thailand and Malaysia concluding their harvest seasons, Vietnamese durian is expected to command premium prices. Current farm-gate prices range from VND42,000 to VND 95,000 per kilogram, ensuring substantial profits for farmers. Although durian prices this year are slightly lower than the previous year, they have been more stable. This has facilitated smoother procurement and ensured the fulfillment of export orders. The superior quality and competitive pricing of Vietnamese durian compared to Thai products have boosted export volumes, particularly to the Chinese market. Another agricultural product experiencing significant growth is coffee. In the first nine months of the year, Vietnam exported over 1.1 million tonnes of this produce, generating over $4 billion in revenue. Despite a decline in volume, the value of coffee exports increased by 30 percent. Similarly, rice exports reached nearly $4 billion, while fruit and vegetable exports surpassed $4.8 billion. Both are forecast to have significant breakthrough in export turnovers. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the export market has shown signs of robust growth, with inventory turnover times decreasing from 1-2 months in the first and second quarters to just 1-3 weeks in the fourth quarter. This indicates a strong demand for Vietnamese agricultural products, especially as the year-end holiday season approaches. Proactive measures such as securing raw materials, enhancing deep processing, and diversifying export markets will further bolster Vietnam's agricultural exports. Moreover, global challenges have presented opportunities for Vietnamese agricultural products to penetrate new markets like Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Europe. As of September 2024, Vietnam's total agricultural, forestry, and fishery exports reached nearly $50 billion, marking a 20-percent increase year-on-year. Despite these positive developments, the agricultural export sector still faces various challenges, including natural disasters, rising freight costs, and a shortage of products meeting international standards. To address these issues, the government is emphasizing the importance of improving product quality, diversifying export markets, and leveraging trade agreements. Beneath the positives of Vietnam's agricultural export growth, a myriad of challenges persists. Natural disasters have caused significant damage, leading to supply chain disruptions and increased transportation costs. Furthermore, the inadequate supply of export-quality produce, traceable to specific growing regions, has become a pressing issue. The lack of comprehensive production planning and market forecasting also remains a significant concern. The rapid growth of certain agricultural products has outpaced regulatory frameworks, leading to potential risks associated with overreliance on specific markets. General Director Nguyen Dinh Tung of Vina T&T Co. emphasized the need for Vietnam's agricultural products to meet stringent food safety and technical standards to remain competitive in the global market. He stressed the importance of diversifying export markets and enhancing the technical barriers to trade for Vietnamese fruits to ensure sustained growth. Deputy Minister Phung Duc Tien of Agriculture and Rural Development expressed confidence in achieving the target of $55 billion in agricultural exports for 2024. To realize this goal, the ministry will focus on deepening processing capabilities, building strong brand identities for Vietnamese agricultural products, and promoting trade facilitation. By leveraging international trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Vietnam-EU Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), Vietnam aims to expand its market reach and support enterprises in securing new export orders. While traditional markets like China, the US, Japan, and Europe remain priorities, the ministry is also actively exploring opportunities in emerging markets such as the Middle East and Africa. These strategic initiatives are designed to foster long-term growth and sustainability in Vietnam's agricultural sector.",
