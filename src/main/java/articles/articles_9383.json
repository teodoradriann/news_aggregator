    "text": "By Jeff Bobo Editor ,\n2 hours ago\nProject Serve Our Soldiers recently honored a volunteer who is passionate about serving active duty service men and women from Hawkins County.\nPSOS founder Corki Weart honored Hayden Fugate on Dec. 10 as the 2024 Volunteer of the Year during a celebration at the Hale Springs Inn to thank donors and volunteers.\nProject Serve Our Soldiers raises money and supplies to make sure local soldiers have snacks and basic supplies like socks and toiletries while they are on deployment.\nTo meet the demand requires a lot of effort, whether it be organizing and staffing fundraisers, or preparing care packages to be sent overseas. This past year PSOS kicked its program into overdrive in anticipation of major deployments from Tennessee National Guard Armories in Rogersville and Mount Carmel.\nWeart said Hayden made personal sacrifices to ensure that he was available to lend a hand at all PSOS events.\n“Hayden has been our most faithful volunteer we’ve ever had,” Weart said. “He’s young, and we need more young people like him to support what we do. He loves Project Serve Our Soldiers, and it’s one of his passions. I don’t know who’s more passionate about our soldiers, whether it’s me or him. We kind of battle for that honor sometimes.”\nFugate was presented with a plaque that reads, “2024 PSOS Volunteer of the Year. Project Serve Our Soldiers presents to Hayden James Fugate, awarded in appreciation of your invaluable volunteer services, contributions, and urgent deployment response to Project Serve Our Soldiers and all those we serve and Support.”\nAnyone interested in making a financial contribution can mail it to: Project Serve Our Soldiers, 183 Manis Road, Rogersville, TN 37857.\nFor more information about volunteering or making a donation call Corki Weart at (407) 883-2036, or email: projectserveoursoldiers@gmail.com",

Foi avistada uma aurora boreal, um fenómeno extremamente raro de ser visto a partir do território nacional. Uma severa tempestade solar atingiu a Terra às 18:00 horas, indicou à SIC Notícias José Afonso, presidente da Sociedade Portuguesa de Astronomia.\nSIC Notícias\nPartilhar\nKátia Dias/Facebook Facebook Whatsapp Twitter Linkedin Mail Uma aurora boreal está a pintar o céu de Portugal esta quinta-feira. Este fenómeno é recorrente nos círculos polares ártico e antártico mas, desta vez, é visível em várias cidades, nomeadamente, em território nacional, em terras altas.\nVários utilizadores das redes sociais não perderam a oportunidade de captar uma imagem deste momento raro. Há relatos de ser visível em terras altas, nas regiões Norte e Centro do país.\nA origem do fenómeno é uma tempestade eletromagnética de grande intensidade, que pode atingir níveis \"extremos\", o que explica o aparecimento destas auroras boreais no Reino Unido, em Espanha e em Portugal.\nA tempestade solar vai prolongar-se até esta sexta-feira. Mesmo assim, e de acordo com José Afonso, investigador e Presidente da Sociedade Portuguesa de Astronomia , é melhor olhar para o céu hoje devido às previsões de chuva para amanhã.\nApesar de extremamente raro, a intensa atividade solar tem tornado o aparecimento de auroras boreais em Portugal mais frequente. A última foi visível no dia 11 de maio deste ano. No início de novembro do ano passado, também tinha sido possível avistar auroras boreais em Portugal. Antes disso, só tinha acontecido a em Portugal na década de 30.\nO que explica? A origem do fenómeno é uma tempestade eletromagnética de grande intensidade.\nO sol tem um pico de atividade de 11 anos, que vai crescendo e decrescendo ao longo do ciclo. Neste momento, está apresentar um pico de atividade, atingido este ano, que faz com que aconteçam várias explosões na sua superfície que, por sua vez, lançam grandes quantidades de matéria para longe. No caminho, podem encontrar a Terra.\nAs diferentes cores estão relacionadas com os diferentes gases existentes na atmosfera: verde para oxigénio, roxo, azul ou rosa para nitrogénio.\nFacebook Whatsapp Twitter Linkedin Mail Tópicos País Veja também Playlist Dinâmica Loading...",

    "title": "New Pa. school funding deal will help underfunded districts, but less than Democrats wanted",
    "text": "A budget deal reached by lawmakers Thursday would inject more than $1 billion of new money into Pennsylvania’s public schools next year — but scale back plans to address inequities between rich and poor school districts that were ruled unconstitutional last year.\nUnder the agreement, more than $500 million would be distributed through a new formula favored by Democrats to bring K-12 schools closer to “adequate” spending levels and reimburse high-taxing school districts . Much of that money would be steered toward lower-wealth districts, which can’t raise as much money through property taxes to fund their schools as more affluent communities.\nAdvertisement But Democrats had proposed sending more than $850 million through that formula, in the first step of a seven-year plan to raise school funding levels by more than $5 billion. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the agreement included any multiyear commitment — a plan Republicans had objected to .\nThe push to overhaul Pennsylvania’s school funding follows a landmark Commonwealth Court ruling last year that found the state had failed to provide a constitutionally guaranteed “thorough and efficient” system of education, depriving students in poorer districts of needed resources.\nFollowing the trial, an expert for the school districts who won the funding lawsuit told lawmakers that Pennsylvania schools needed to spend an extra $6 billion to provide students with an adequate education — based on what districts that meet state standards are spending.\nBut Republicans pushed back on that number, along with a subsequent proposal by Gov. Josh Shapiro and Democrats to increase state aid to schools by $5.1 billion over the next seven years — a 65% increase over the $7.9 billion Pennsylvania currently spends on basic education funding.\nThe deal appears to have shifted those “adequate” spending targets downward by incorporating a different method of calculating a school district’s poverty than what Democrats had proposed. Rather than using data reported by school districts on how many low-income students they enroll, Republicans pushed to use census estimates of each district’s level of poverty. Advocates said earlier this week that the GOP data projected fewer students living in poverty statewide than what districts have reported — and would reduce the calculation of how much money districts need by $700 million.\nRather than put more money toward the adequate spending targets, the deal includes new pots of spending — including $60 million for districts that lose out because of the state’s “hold harmless” policy . That policy has shielded districts with shrinking enrollment from funding cuts, while growing districts — many in Southeastern Pennsylvania — haven’t seen a corresponding increase in state aid.\nThe agreement also makes some changes related to funding for cyber charter schools — but less than what Democrats had proposed. The deal includes $100 million to reimburse school districts for payments to cyber charters, which are funded by districts at the same rate as brick-and-mortar charters.\nBecause school district spending varies widely between communities, those per-pupil rates range from $8,600 to more than $26,000. Democrats proposed a flat rate of $8,000 per cyber-charter pupil — part of a proposal they said would save districts more than $500 million. Cyber charter advocates said the proposal would mean massive cuts for their schools.\nThe deal reached Thursday would save districts $69 million, by reducing what districts pay cyber charters for special education students.\nAlso under the agreement, lawmakers will increase funding for programs that give tax credits to businesses that fund private school scholarships by $75 million. Pennsylvania currently spends more than $470 million on those programs, which supporters have touted as an essential form of school choice, but public education advocates have criticized as lacking transparency, and routing money to private schools instead of bolstering the public system.\nThe main spending bill and its accompanying code bills that define how the state can spend its money still needed to pass the chambers Thursday evening but were being fast-tracked through the legislature. It was then expected to head to Shapiro for his signature.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement",

The delay was significant enough for the CEO of the company, Greg George, to take to social media and apologize.\nFind every episode of Florida Foodie on YouTube:\n“Today I come to the residents of Winter Garden and Orlando to personally apologize for the long wait on us getting our new dessert shop open in Winter Garden,” the post on Oct. 10 read. “The burden falls on me personally as things have not happened as fast as any of us had wanted. I wanted to apologize to everyone for the long wait and let you know.”\nThis is the second location of the chain in Central Florida. There is another location in Ormond Beach, according to the company’s website , with more locations planned in Winter Park, The Villages, New Smyrna Beach, Lake Buena Vista, Daytona Beach, Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral.\nThe chain is currently headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, but, according to the Courier Journal , it started as a food truck in Nashville in 2013.\nCheck out the Florida Foodie podcast.

    "text": "Decenas de personas se lanzaron a las aguas heladas del puerto de Boston como parte de una tradición de 120 años en la ciudad y que celebra con una inmersión polar el día de Año Nuevo. Desafiando temperaturas del agua de unos seis grados Celsius y del aire apenas por encima del congelamiento, los nadadores se sumergieron al sonido de gaitas. Afuera, los asistentes sostenían fotografías de seres queridos que perdieron el año pasado y que habían participado en el gélido festival en años anteriores. Algunos de los participantes de la ciudad, fanática de los deportes, vistieron máscaras de hockey o camisetas de sus equipos favoritos, mientras que otros lucieron atuendos festivos como el traje rojo de Santa. Incluso una familia se vistió de abeja para honrar a su padre fallecido. \"Al empezar el Año Nuevo de esta forma, siento que al salir del agua renazco. De verdad. Quiero decir, me estoy congelando pero me siento realmente bien\", dijo a la AFP Ruth Tannert, de 65 años, proveniente de Roslindale, Massachusetts. \"Tener esto como una forma de darle arranque al nuevo año. No se me ocurre ninguna otra manera\", agregó. En Estados Unidos hay varios de estos clubes de natación en aguas heladas, pero el denominado L Street Brownies de Boston afirma ser uno de los más antiguos, con una tradición que se remonta a 1904.
