    "text": "NFL player props: 5 best bets for Wild Card Weekend After fighting all season to get to the playoffs, weather could be the most dominant factor in 2 of the games and will have an impact on a couple of this week's Wild Card Weekend.

Lines last updated Friday at 8:22 p.m. ET. All games ET unless noted. Texans RB Devin Singletary UNDER 66.5 rushing yards (-110) - Host Browns, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. (NBC) After a strong beginning when he became a starter, Singletary's numbers have dropped off primarily due to a lack a opportunities. He has topped this number just twice in his last 7 games. The reason for his lack of elite rushing days is that he has had 13 carries or fewer in 5 of the last 7 games, including just 9 carries against the Browns in Week 16. In order to top this number, he may need more than 15 carries and that may not be possible against a tough Browns defense that will make Houston earn everything it gets. Bills QB Josh Allen SCORES A TOUCHDOWN (-105) - Host Steelers, Sunday, 1 p.m. (CBS) Allen has scored 15 rushing TDs in his last 15 games, including 8 in his last 6 games. With a considerable amount of snow expected, when the Bills get near the goal line, Allen will likely call his own number to close out drives. He does when the weather is fine. He's likely to do it more often when the footing is bad and he knows where he's going while defenders try to react. Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco OVER 66.5 rushing yards (-115) - Host Dolphins, Saturday, 8:10 p.m. (Peacock) One thing that is true about cold weather games is that the passing game is impacted much more negatively than the run game. No matter how sideline personnel try to keep the balls warm, when it's near zero degrees with 25 mph winds, the balls become like bricks in less than a minute. Pacheco has been the most consistent part of the Chiefs offense in their playoff run and has rushed 15 or more times in 5 of his 6 six games. In his last home game, he has rushed 18 times for 130 yards. With his speed and strength, if Pacheco gets 15 carries, which is very likely, it will be extremely difficult for the depleted Dolphins defense to keep him below this number. Lions RB Jahmyr Gibbs UNDER 52.5 rushing yards (-120) - Host Rams, Sunday, 8:15 p.m. (NBC) This one is a tough number not to surpass given the Lions elite offensive line, but there are a couple of factors that are going to make this number a little too high to pass barring a 20-yard carry along the way. The first is that veteran RB David Montgomery is the conventional runner coach Dan Campbell counts on to close out games and set the tone offensively. With the Lions making a rare playoff appearance, it is much more likely that Campbell will lean on Montgomery as the primary back and Gibbs as a change-of-pace/receiving back. The other issue is that the Rams are likely to come out throwing and try to turn the game into a shootout. If that happens, Gibbs may get his share of yardage as a receiver, but he likely won't get the carries he will need to top a number he hasn't beat in his last 2 games. Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb OVER 98.5 receiving yards (-115) - Host Packers, Sunday, 4:30 p.m. (FOX) If the Cowboys are ever going to excise their playoff demons, it is going to require QB Dak Prescott to play some of the best ball of his career. To do that, it will require a heavy dose of Lamb. The Cowboys were chasing down the Eagles all season and have been playing playoff-style football for the last month and they have counted on Lamb to be the centerpiece of the offense. In his last 3 games, Lamb has caught 32 passes and posted yardage days of 118, 227 and 98. He has made his case of being the most dominant receiver in the league and will be targeted early often against a young Packers defense that will likely be unable to hold him down.
