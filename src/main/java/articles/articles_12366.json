    "text": "Met Office issues amber weather warning as snow expected to cause power cuts and travel chaos\nAn icy weekend could result in power cuts and travel disruption.\nThe Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for snow and freezing rain, covering the entirety of Cheshire East.\nMotorists are being advised to stay off the roads, with delays likely and road closures possible as well.\n\"It is safer not to drive in these conditions, but if you need to make an essential journey, consider alternative forms of transport, to keep you and others safe,\" reads the Met Office website.\n\"If you must drive, do this more safely by: using dipped headlights; accelerating gently, using low revs and changing to higher gears as quickly as possible; starting in second gear to help with wheel slip; maintaining a safe and steady speed, keeping distance from other vehicles; using a low gear to go downhill, avoiding braking unless necessary; steering into skids, not taking your hands of the wheel, and avoiding slamming on brakes.\"\nThere is also a 'good chance' of power cuts, according to the Met Office.\nThe website adds: \"People cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. It's easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.\n\"If isolated due to snow or ice, follow these simple steps to keep safe and well: keep the thermostat set to the same temperature both during the day and at night; turn off electrical heaters and put out your fire before going to bed; ensure pets are safe by keeping them warm and comfortable; prevent frozen pipes by opening kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing; stay indoors, wrap up warm and close internal doors to keep the heat in; and, if you need support call the British Red Cross Support Line on 0808 196 3651.\n\"Help to protect vulnerable people that you know including older people, those with underlying conditions and those who live alone; they may need support with food and medical supplies. If you are worried about your health or that of somebody you know, ring NHS 111.\"\nThe amber weather warning comes into effect at 6pm on Saturday, December 4, and lasts until midday on Sunday, December 5.\nThere is expected to be 'persistent and heavy' snow along with a period of freezing rain.\nNew macclesfield [Jobs](https://macclesfield.nub.news/jobs) Section Launched!!\nVacancies updated hourly!!\nClick here: [macclesfield jobs](https://macclesfield.nub.news/jobs)\nShare:",

Les supporters portant des [maillot Arsenal](https://cadeaumaillots.fr/Club-297/Arsenal-304)pendant la saison pensent qu'Arsenal, jouant à domicile, peut gagner ce match.

    "title": "July starts on a good note, Pune district has received twice the normal rainfall till date",
    "text": "Click hereto join\nExpress Pune WhatsApp channeland get a curated list of our stories\nPune district has recorded more than twice its normal rainfall since the start of the monsoon, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) noting 449 mm of rain so far against a normal of 275.1 mm. July too has begun on a good note, with 117.6 mm of rain reported so far, as compared to the normal of 83 mm for the month.\nA key feature of this month’s showers is the near-continuous rainfall, with relatively few instances of intense, heavy, or very heavy spells. As per IMD parameters, heavy rainfall is defined as 64.5–115.5 mm in 24 hours, while very heavy rainfall ranges from 115.6–204.4 mm. An intense spell is one where 90 per cent of the day’s rain falls within an hour.\nThe consistent rains have helped improve water storage in dams across the district. Pavana dam, which supplies water to Pimpri-Chinchwad, is now at 67.67 per cent of its capacity, up sharply from 20.30 per cent this time last year. Khadakwasla is at 56.82 per cent (53.15 per cent last year), Panshet at 68.63 per cent (31.31), Warasgaon at 73.52 per cent (19.14), and Temghar at 61.96 per cent (18.56).\nOverall, the 22 dams in Pune district are now at 87.38 per cent of their collective capacity, compared to 76.83 per cent last year.\nWith rising storage, controlled discharge has begun into several rivers, including the Pavana, Mutha, and Indrayani, contributing to higher water levels downstream at Ujjani dam.",
