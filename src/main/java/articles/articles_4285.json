    "title": "Pro-Kremlin X accounts push fake Fox News articles ahead of debate",
    "text": "A network of pro-Kremlin accounts on X pushed fake Fox News articles in the hours ahead of Thursday’s presidential debate, attempting to spread false narratives including one about former President Donald Trump’s support in the business community.\nThe fake articles, first reported on X by the account @antibot4navalny , an anonymous group of analysts tracking Russia-related influence operations, directed people to a fake version of Fox News’ website. That website appears to be part of a known Russian disinformation campaign that has mimicked legitimate news websites from Le Monde in France to The Washington Post. E.U. researchers dubbed it the doppelgänger network in 2022.\nIn March, Alethea , a company that researches online risks including disinformation, identified 81 websites and more than 5,000 X accounts as part of the campaign.\nThe messages posted Thursday on X from some of those accounts, many of which rarely post, were unique but carried similar messaging and had been reposted thousands of times by early afternoon. “Biden’s presidency could be our downfall. Trump seems to be our only hope of recovery,” one read . Many pointed to a fake article with the headline “Businesses Chooses Trump and a Great America” that claimed businesspeople from Silicon Valley and beyond were lining up to support Trump.\nLaundering propaganda through Kremlin-created or approved news outlets is a tried and true tactic, but this campaign has taken on a modern twist. It uses a fake website that credibly imitates a legitimate news outlet, sharing links through a network of seemingly automated accounts in a way that is not easily detected by platforms and researchers.\n4 hours ago Live updates: Biden, Trump debate hours away in first face-to-face since 2020 Decision 2024 2 hours ago Here's a look at the false claims you might hear during tonight's presidential debate Decision 2024 3 hours ago Biden and Trump are set to debate. Here's what their past performances looked like Another article shared by accounts in the network with the headline “Mission: Almost Impossible” included an argument that President Joe Biden would need only to remain on his feet to win the debate and that Democrats were plotting to steal the election. It also included dehumanizing language about immigrants, in furtherance of the conspiracy theory of widespread illegal voting by immigrants.\nEfforts to manipulate social media discussion around the debate — arguably the first major event of the campaign season — underscore the warnings that many researchers, technologists and political scientists have issued regarding the threat that disinformation continues to pose, particularly as technology platforms have pulled back on moderation efforts .\nThe fake version of the Fox News website along with the accounts on X also highlight how foreign manipulation efforts have evolved in recent years. The fake website looks almost identical to Fox News’ real website, and the fake article uses the name of a real Fox News reporter.\n“The story is fake,” a Fox News spokesperson confirmed in an email.\nThe X accounts are also more convincing than previous manipulation efforts that often posted in broken English and used similar or identical phrases across dozens of accounts.\nThe aims, however, appear to be similar to those from previous election cycles . The doppelgänger network uses X accounts that mostly pose as conservative voters to spread the manufactured articles and ultimately attempt to stoke division in the U.S. Subjects of previous articles have included Taylor Swift, military aid funding to Ukraine and the border crisis.\nThe doppelgänger operation, while prolific in content creation, often fails to reach and engage Americans, C. Shawn Eib, head of investigations at Alethea, said in an email to NBC News.\nIts latest efforts, “while widespread, do not appear to be gaining substantial engagement from authentic U.S. audiences.”\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com .

    "text": "New Delhi: Away from the ongoing political row over invitations for the Pran Pratishtha event of Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22, thousands of Lord Ram devotees from all over the country are likely to throng Ayodhya for the mega-event. Among these Ram Bhakts, one is Shabnam Shaikh of Mumbai, who embarked on her journey to the UP town on foot from the country’s financial capital. Accompanied by her two friends Raman Raj Sharma and Vineet Pandey, Shaikh has set out to cover a distance of 1,425 km on foot before reaching Ayodhya to get a glimpse of Ram Lalla. Shaikh, who claims to be an ardent devotee of Lord Ram, said, “One does not need to be a Hindu to worship Lord Ram…he belongs to all.” View this post on Instagram On her way to Ayodhya from Mumbai, Shaikh often shares her videos and photos on social media platforms about the love and affection she has been getting from people. In a video, Shaikh is seen being welcomed by locals at Pimpalgaon near Nashik. In another video shared on Friday, Shaikh is heard urging people to gift her a vehicle so that she can carry other gifts which she has received from people on her way to Ayodhya. View this post on Instagram She said that she walks about 25-30km daily so that she could reach Ayodhya on or before January 22. Shaikh, whose videos are being widely shared on social, said with this journey, she also aims to change misconception that only men or boys can undertake such journeys. With the consecration ceremony scheduled to be held on January 22, construction work for the grand Ram Temple is currently under way in Ayodhya. A massive crowd is expected to congregate on Ayodhya close to the consecration ceremony and the city is getting decked up for the big day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Shri Ram International Airport and the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station on December 30. While the core of the newly built airport, located about 15 km from the main Ayodhya city, uses modern construction material, the facade of the terminal has been lent a traditional look as done in the new building of the Ayodhya station.

    "title": "Study: Popular Weight-Loss Drug Ozempic Shrinks Heart Muscles in Recipients",
    "text": "Popular weight-loss drug Ozempic is shrinking the human heart and other muscles, according to a disturbing new University of Alberta study .\nAccording to researchers, people should be cautious about taking trendy new weight-loss drugs due to the potentially deadly side effects.\nUalberta.ca reports: “If people have been prescribed these drugs, then the benefits should likely far exceed the risks,” says Jason Dyck, lead author on the study, pediatrics professor in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry and a member of the Women and Children’s Health Research Institute.\n“However, the growing number of people who may be taking these drugs who do not meet the eligibility criteria and who are not at risk have a different risk-reward calculation that they should be made aware of.”\nDyck and his team set out to study why a reported side-effect of the leading weight-loss drug Ozempic is the loss of skeletal muscle.\nOzempic, known medically as semaglutide, was originally designed to help adult patients with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar. However, this drug — and a host of others in this class of medication — are also being touted for their effectiveness as an anti-obesity medication.\nUsing mice for the study, the researchers found that heart muscle also decreased in both obese and lean mice. The systemic effect observed in mice was then confirmed in cultured human heart cells.\nDyck, who is the Canada Research Chair in Molecular Medicine and heads up the Cardiovascular Research Centre , says his team did not observe any detrimental functional effects in hearts of mice with smaller hearts and thus would not expect any overt health effects in humans. But he adds that there may be more impact over the long term, or some forms of cardiac stress may have a detrimental effect that wasn’t observed at rest.\n“Given the growing number of people taking this drug who have no cardiovascular disease or who are not classified as obese, we suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies.”\nDyck’s study comes on the heels of a commentary published in the November issue of The Lancet by an international team of researchers from the U of A, McMaster and Louisiana State University who examined emerging research showing that up to 40 per cent of the weight lost by people using weight-loss drugs is actually muscle.\nCarla Prado, a nutrition researcher in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences and lead author on the commentary, explains this rate of muscle decline is significantly higher than what is typically observed with calorie-reduced diets or normal aging and could lead to a host of long-term health issues — including decreased immunity, increased risk of infections and poor wound healing.\n“Muscle does much more than just help us move or lift things. It is a powerful organ that keeps us healthy in a number of ways,” she says.\nFor example, muscle stores important building blocks — amino acids — that the body uses when we’re sick, stressed or injured to repair itself and stay strong. It also plays a huge role in managing blood sugar, which helps prevent diabetes.\nAs well, Prado notes muscle releases special molecules called myokines that signal other parts of the body to help fight infections and support our immune system.\n“That’s why preserving muscle is so important, especially during weight-loss treatments — it’s not just about staying strong, but about keeping our whole body resilient and healthy.”\nIn the commentary, the authors suggest that muscle loss due to weight reduction may also exacerbate conditions like sarcopenic obesity — characterized by a combination of high body fat and low skeletal muscle mass — which contributes to poorer health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rates.\nThough the short-term effects of muscle loss on physical strength and function remain unclear, the commentary calls for future research to explore how reductions in muscle mass might improve muscle mass and composition.\nTo keep muscle strong while losing weight, Prado says it is essential to focus on two main things: nutrition and exercise. Proper nutrition means getting enough high-quality protein, essential vitamins and minerals, and other “muscle-building” nutrients. Sometimes, this can include protein supplements to make sure the body has what it needs.\n“Exercise is just as important — specifically resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands,” said Prado, who was recently named Canada Research Chair in Integrative Nutrition, Body Composition and Energy Metabolism.\n“This type of exercise helps keep muscle from breaking down during weight loss and maintains strength.”\nShe adds that for anyone using weight loss medications, it’s best to follow a balanced program that includes both enough protein and resistance training.\n“This can help people lose fat while minimizing muscle loss, which helps them get the full health benefits of treatment and stay strong.”\nPrado, who is a member of the Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta , the Women and Children’s Health Research Institute , the Alberta Diabetes Institute , the Alberta Transplant Institute and the Institute of Sensory Motor Rehabilitative Technology , is collaborating with Dyck to explore the mechanisms and impact of various forms of muscle wasting in relation to this class of medication.",

    "title": "Hero saved woman's family from the Nazis: Story is 'chillingly relevant' today | Fox News",
    "text": "Linda Margolin Royal, a former advertising copywriter from Australia, was apprehensive about the January 2024 release of her debut novel, \\\"The Star on the Grave,\\\" given the rampant antisemitism worldwide today in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks against Israel. Her book, \\\"The Star on the Grave,\\\" is a fictional historical account of how her family was saved from the Holocaust by Chiune Sugihara, a heroic Japanese diplomat known as \\\"the Japanese Schindler.\\\" While Royal was elated to learn from her publisher, Affirm Press, that her book was the No. 1 Australian fiction debut in the month after its release, she told Fox News Digital that to this day, she can’t shake the eerie feeling she's reliving her own family’s history as she tells their story. ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS She was struck, she said, by her own words: \\\"Jews run because we learn anyone can become a Jew-hater … Do you know what a betrayal that is?\\\" Royal finished writing her book in Sept. 2023. When she reviewed it as it was going to print about a month later, she said she told her publisher, \\\"People are going to think I wrote this [book] post-Oct. 7 because of how chillingly relevant the sentiments are.\\\" Saved the lives of many Jews Sugihara’s only surviving son, Nobuki Sugihara, 75, shared with Fox News Digital the background of how his father saved many Jewish people, including Royal's own family, from death. In 1940, when his father was serving as vice-consul for Japan in Lithuania and in Prague, European Jews came to him, fearing for their lives after the Nazis invaded, said Nobuki Sugihara. Defying governmental orders, the elder Sugihara surreptitiously issued 2,139 transit visas, according to multiple sources, so the Jews could escape from Poland and Germany to the United States, Canada and Australia through Japan and Siberia in the Soviet Union. Sugihara and another diplomat from the Netherlands, Jan Zwartendijk, risked their lives and their professions to rescue Jewish refugees, according to multiple sources. Zwartendijk did so despite being under Nazi rule by issuing destination visas to Curaçao, according to The Times of Israel. Both men suffered negative consequences in their jobs for going against their superiors. SURVIVOR OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECOUNTS PAIN, GRIEF OF LOSING ‘ANGEL’ BOYFRIEND ON OCT. 7 In 1985 and 1997, respectively, Sugihara and Zwartendijk were honored by Yad Vashem, The World Holocaust Remembrance Center, as The Righteous Among the Nations. The Righteous Among the Nations is a title awarded to non-Jews who risked their lives to rescue Jews during the Holocaust. \\\"He was a man who did the right thing. He was very humble.\\\" They are honored with The Medal of the Righteous, which is inscribed with the Jewish saying: \\\"Whosoever saves a single life, saves an entire universe\\\" (Mishnah, Sanhedrin 4:5), according to Yad Vashem. Royal, the novelist, said that Nobuki Sugihara described his father as \\\"very caring and loving, and he was a man who did the right thing. He was very humble.\\\" Nobuki Sugihara himself told Fox News Digital that he did not know about all the people his father saved until he read about it in a newspaper article when he was 19 years old. Royal’s own father, Michael, and his parents came from Poland to Lithuania, where they discovered they could obtain transit visas before traveling through Japan to Australia. They ultimately chose to reside in Australia. Royal remembered her father telling her that he met Sugihara at the consulate when he was 11 years old — and that he had \\\"kind eyes.\\\" Multiple sources have said Sugihara rescued as many as 6,000 Jewish people, but Nobuki Sugihara said it’s impossible to know the exact figure, since one passport was for an entire family. Including descendants of the survivors, his father could have saved as many as 500,000 Jewish people. He said that in 2016, The Mirrer Yeshiva Central Institute estimated that, including descendants of the survivors, his father could have saved as many as 500,000 Jewish people. Emotional meeting Overwhelmed with gratitude for Sugihara’s selfless heroism, Royal told Fox News Digital how emotional it was for her to meet the son of the hero at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City five years ago, when he was a guest speaker. Sensing the man's reserve as they stood together, she said, \\\"I asked him if I could hug him, and he sort of smiled … I could see that his wife was smiling, and that it was OK to do that.\\\" MOTHER OF AMERICAN-ISRAELI HOSTAGE TAKEN ON OCT. 7 SAYS HER FAITH HELPS HER THROUGH HER DARKEST DEPTHS OF PAIN She added, \\\"I just said to him, ‘It's the closest thing to hugging your dad.'\\\" She went on to Fox News Digital, \\\"I'm alive because of his dad, and my kids are alive because of his dad.\\\" Royal never got the chance to meet Sugihara himself before he passed away at age 86 in 1986. But she imagined what it could have been like through Rachel Margol, the 20-year-old headstrong protagonist of her book, \\\"The Star on the Grave.\\\" When Rachel Margol meets Sugihara at the Minsk Hotel in Moscow to thank him for giving her family and other families lifesaving transit visas from Lithuania to Japan, he replied, \\\"I only did what was right … That is all. It’s what anyone would have done.\\\" Rachel then points out that others did not do what he did. She hands him a letter from her grandmother, Felka, who is named after Royal’s own grandmother, and is depicted to be just like her in the story. Rachel shares a close, loving bond with Felka — just as Royal had with her in real life. FAR-LEFT HATRED OF JEWS TODAY ECHOES THE SOCIALISM AND ANTISEMITISM OF HITLER IN THE 1930S Felka is bold, like her signature color red, and she had an exuberant, magnetic presence that drew in everyone. When Felka and Rachel celebrated their 60th and 21st birthdays together in Japan, \\\"The waiters clear the table, and Felka steps up onto the table … They dance joyfully among the rice grains, squashing them into the soles of their high-heeled shoes. Their feet thump the red tablecloth, and they link arms and sing.\\\" \\\"That was my grandmother,\\\" Royal told Fox News Digital. \\\"She did dance on tables and drink vodka … She came to life on the page because that's how my grandmother was. She was hilarious!\\\" However, beneath a flair for life were tragic memories that she buried deep within herself so that the world would never know her pain, said Royal. There is a scene in \\\"The Star on the Grave\\\" in which Felka, the grandmother, is suddenly gripped by grief and anxiety while helping her granddaughter plan her wedding to a Greek Orthodox doctor. \\\"I noticed there was so much trauma with children of Holocaust survivors.\\\" Rachel's lack of knowledge about her true identity hits Felka — and the secrets of her past begin to unravel. Felka tells her granddaughter what it was like to be married and have a baby at age 18 in Warsaw, Poland in 1926. She described Warsaw as \\\"a city of intellectuals, of culture, music and theater\\\" — until suddenly it wasn’t. Felka's parents as well as her husband's parents were likely murdered in the Warsaw Ghetto or the Treblinka extermination camp in Warsaw, according to historical accounts. WOMAN VANDALIZES ISRAELI HOSTAGE POSTERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF CAPTIVES' FAMILY MEMBERS IN NEW YORK CITY She could no longer continue to pursue a degree in law because Jews were not allowed to attend certain schools. She tells her granddaughter, \\\"Hating us is a European tradition.\\\" Felka also reveals that her father didn’t want her to know she was Jewish. \\\"Michael forced us. To hide it. He was so worried you would get hurt.\\\" One night, while she was on a swing, Rachel tried to bring up the subject of her mother, whom she lost when she was just nine years old. Her father shut down the conversation, leading Rachel to say to herself, \\\"Being Michael’s daughter is a winter like no other, with no spring in sight.\\\" ‘Disorder on the inside' Royal told Fox News Digital that she \\\"took her characters to therapy.\\\" She wanted to understand the effects of generational trauma. \\\"I noticed there was so much trauma with children of Holocaust survivors,\\\" she said. Royal discussed the intricacies of her characters' lives with a therapist, she said, such as how Michael’s unresolved childhood trauma affected his parenting skills. She said she wanted to make sure she was accurately portraying the characters and their interactions with each other. While writing a scene involving Felka, she realized the grandmother was very obsessive-compulsive; for example, all the tassels on her Persian rug had to be facing in the same direction. She said she asked a therapist, \\\"Does that mean if her outside world was ordered, that she could cope with the disorder on the inside?\\\" \\\"All this trauma from the Holocaust is resurfacing in their dreams.\\\" The therapist replied, \\\"Yes, you’ve nailed it. That’s exactly what happens.\\\" Royal noticed the anguished look in Felka’s eyes in a photo she took with her on her wedding day. She told Fox News Digital, \\\"At the time of my wedding, I just thought these were lovely photos of me with my grandmother, but when I started researching trauma and looking back at the photos — suddenly I just got this electric shock when I looked in her eyes. You can just see the trauma. She's just completely overwhelmed.\\\" Royal’s grandmother passed away in 2002, when she was 93 years old.

I think all this trauma would just surface … In old age, all the bad memories come back.\\\" She added, \\\"All my friends who have Holocaust-surviving parents — they’re now having nightmares. All this trauma from the Holocaust is resurfacing in their dreams.\\\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Inspired by Chiune Sugihara's bravery, Royal said she wants to speak at schools about implementing a \\\"Power of One\\\" educational program or campaign — to show that one person can have a powerful ripple effect, such as when it comes to stopping antisemitism. \\\"It takes one person to go against the crowd and think for themselves — like Sugihara. He had such a strong moral compass, his whole life was affected by it.\\\" She added, \\\"The power of one can have significant, far-reaching consequences.\\\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.",

    "title": "'They didn't accept their fate': Maple Leafs push Bruins to another Game 7",
    "text": "TORONTO — Sheldon Keefe's team had a decision to make. The Maple Leafs head coach watched his players put in a terrible Game 4 performance on home ice against the Boston Bruins — one that left them sitting in a 3-1 series hole against an opponent seemingly on cruise control to the second round of the Stanley Cup tournament. The disastrous showing last Saturday also included star Toronto forwards Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and William Nylander bickering on the bench, and brought ugly narratives from past playoff failures bubbling back to the surface. No heart. Not tough enough. Poorly constructed roster. Overpaid. The Leafs could have packed it in. They decided instead to fight on. \"I challenged the group,\" Keefe said Thursday after Toronto once again stayed alive to even its best-of-seven matchup with Boston 3-3. \"When your back's against the wall and you're facing elimination, you're going to be remembered one way or the other. \"How do you want that to be and to look?\" Following consecutive 2-1 victories — one in overtime in Boston and Thursday's hard-fought decision on the same ice the team was lustily booed off of last weekend — Toronto likes how things look heading into Saturday's winner-take-all Game 7 at TD Garden. \"They didn't lay down,\" added Keefe, whose team blocked 27 shots in Game 6 compared to Boston's 14. \"They didn't accept their fate. They changed it.\" Minus the ailing Matthews, who's clearly far from 100-per-cent healthy and sat out the last two do-or-die tilts after scoring 69 times in the regular season, Toronto has forced just its fourth Game 7 in franchise history after trailing a series 3-1 thanks in large part to its commitment to defence and the performance of rookie goaltender Joseph Woll. The 25-year-old replaced Ilya Samsonov — not terrible in the series, but outplayed by Jeremy Swayman at the other end of the rink — late in Game 4. Woll's run with his opportunity by allowing a paltry two goals against in just over seven periods. Nylander, who missed the first three games with an undisclosed illness, was also key after providing all the offence Thursday. \"We came in with a mentality that we have nothing to lose,\" said rookie forward Matthew Knies, who has taken his game to another level. \"We're just excited to go back (to Boston) and finish the deal.\" One team will buck a trend Saturday. The other will have to answer more tough questions. Toronto has lost five straight Game 7s, including three to the Bruins (2013, 2018 and 2019). The Original Six franchise's only series win when needing three straight victories to avoid elimination — the Leafs fell short in 2013 and 2018 — came in 1942 when the club actually bagged four in a row after falling behind the Detroit Red Wings 3-0 in the Cup final. \"Great opportunity,\" said captain John Tavares. \"The group's stayed together, continued to work.\" Boston, meanwhile, is now desperately hoping to avoid becoming the first team in NHL history to blow 3-1 leads in consecutive seasons. The Florida Panthers, who await Saturday's winner, roared back to beat the Bruins some 12 months ago. \"We're not living in the past and we're not living in the future,\" Boston head coach Jim Montgomery said. \"We're living in the present.\" Toronto winger Tyler Bertuzzi has a pretty good idea of what the feeling is like in Boston's locker room at the moment. He experienced last season's collapse first-hand in black and gold before signing with the Leafs in free agency. \"I think everyone's frustrated over there,\" he said. The Bruins, who have lost six straight games with a chance to eliminate a team as they limp back to TD Garden, are in search of answers. \"There's always optimism,\" Montgomery added. \"There's the opportunity to play in a Game 7. You grew up all your life wanting to (be) a part of it. We have a chance to be a part of it. \"We've got to go in there and we've got to dig in.\" Left for dead less than a week ago, the Leafs have already done that. \"In my mind, we've already played two Game 7s,\" Keefe said. \"(But) all we've earned is another game on the schedule. As good as this feels and as proud of the group as you are for the effort they put forth and the results they've gotten … all we've done is earn that.\" The first franchise in NHL history to force Game 7 after facing a 3-1 series deficit three times against the same opponent, the Leafs now have a chance to write a much different story than the one that looked likely less than a week ago. Nylander was asked what it's like to play in a winner-take-all finale. The winger knows Toronto's painful recent history in these moments. \"Special,\" he said with a smile. \"I don't know if we've won one yet, but we're up to the test.\" The Leafs have cleared a couple of big hurdles — with one more to come.
