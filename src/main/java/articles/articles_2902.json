    "title": "A new primary school in the heart of Lévis by 2027",
    "text": "By the start of the 2027 school year, a brand new primary school will take root in the heart of Lévis, a stone’s throw from the Cité de la Coopération and the UMANO district, thanks to the purchase by the City of Lévis of land at a cost of $5.6 million belonging to Desjardins Group.\nThis project received the green light from Quebec in June 2023, but we had to wait a year before finding land on which to build it, which represented quite a challenge in this sector, indicated the general director of the Center de services scolaire des Navigators, Suzie Lucas, at a press briefing Thursday afternoon.\nThe impasse was finally resolved thanks to collaboration with Mouvement Desjardins, which agreed to sell part of its land to the City of Lévis, subsequently transferred to the school service center as provided for by current legislation.\nThe two partners ensure that the sum paid for this “exceptional purchase” corresponds to the “fair market value” of the land.\nThis lot, which was not for sale initially, could have brought in much more for Mouvement Desjardins if it had been put up for auction, said its president, Guy Cormier.\n300 students\nThe new school, which will accommodate 300 students, will bear the name of Dorimène Desjardins, the co-founder of the Desjardins Movement, to highlight this collaboration.\nThe establishment will be located at the corner of Saint-Omer and des Commandeurs streets, near the Pointe-Lévy secondary school and the campus of the University of Quebec in Rimouski, a geographical proximity which will make it possible to accommodate interns in teaching and research projects, said Mme Lucas.\nThis construction of a “new generation” primary school will make it possible to “decongest” the three other establishments in the sector, which are full to bursting.\nOverflowing schools\nThe need for space in the schools of the Navigators Service Center will nevertheless remain acute in the coming years, since Lévis is one of the Quebec municipalities with the highest growth.\nThe service center had submitted 20 projects to add space last fall, but only five projects to purchase modular classrooms received the green light from Quebec recently.\nPresent during the press briefing, the Minister of Education, Bernard Drainville, recognized that the sums allocated for new school construction and expansion projects are far from sufficient to meet needs.\n“Is this enough? No,” he said, while asserting that the pace of investments in recent years was “not sustainable” in the long term.\nThis explains why the school network must increasingly turn to temporary premises, which represent a real lifeline in the circumstances, indicated Mr.me Lucas.\n“We are saved by the modular ones, we must say it,” she said, while specifying that these temporary classes will be there for several more years. We will have to learn to live with it to be able to meet our needs.”\nDo you have any information to share with us about this story?\nWrite to us at or call us directly at 1 800-63SCOOP.",

    "title": "La escalofriante historia real detrás de 'Bebé Reno', la nueva serie entre lo más visto de Netflix",
    "text": "'Bebé Reno', conocida como 'Baby reindeer' en su título original en inglés, narra la compleja relación entre 'Donny Dunn', un comediante sin éxito interpretado por Richard Gadd, y su acosadora 'Martha', interpretada por Jessica Gunning. A través de esta trama, la serie aborda el acoso como una enfermedad mental, así como temas de soledad y dependencia emocional.A diferencia de otras producciones que romantizan el acoso, como la popular serie 'You', 'Bebé Reno' ofrece una perspectiva más profunda sobre la salud mental tanto del acosador como de la víctima, fomentando la empatía y explorando los demonios internos que todos enfrentamos. Lo que sorprende aún más es que esta escalofriante historia tiene sus raíces en la vida real. El propio escritor y protagonista de la serie, Richard Gadd, se inspiró en su propia experiencia de ser acosado para crear esta impactante narrativa.Según revela el primer episodio de la serie, todo comenzó con un simple gesto de bondad por parte de Gadd, al ofrecer una taza de té gratis a una mujer desconocida en el bar donde trabajaba. Sin embargo, este acto generoso desencadenó una invasión sin precedentes a su privacidad.(Seguir leyendo: Netflix anuncia 34 nuevas producciones de Corea del Sur en su parrilla). Durante cinco angustiosos años, Gadd recibió más de 41,071 correos electrónicos, 744 tuits, 350 horas de mensajes de voz, 106 cartas y 46 mensajes de Facebook por parte de su acosadora. Estos mismos mensajes, con sus errores gramaticales, insinuaciones y a veces tono sexual, son retratados fielmente en la serie, sirviendo como recordatorios inquietantes de la obsesión de Martha.La genialidad de 'Bebé Reno' radica en su capacidad para mostrar las dos caras de la moneda: la vecina risueña que parece inofensiva al principio, y la acosadora obsesiva que se esconde detrás de una pantalla.(Le puede interesar: ‘El caballero negro’: alta tecnología en la serie que estrena Netflix ). Además, la serie explora cómo el trauma puede generar una dependencia enfermiza en la víctima, quien busca desesperadamente llenar los vacíos emocionales causados por el acoso.En palabras del propio Gadd durante el evento anual de Netflix, Tudum: \"Creo que la vida es una comedia dramática. En algunos de los lugares más oscuros en los que he estado, de alguna manera he encontrado risas. Y algunos de los lugares más divertidos en los que he estado, incluidos los 'backstage' de clubes de comedia con otros comediantes, también pueden ser los lugares más deprimentes. Siempre pienso que la vida es una mezcla de luces y sombras. Así que quería que ‘Bebé Reno’ fuera una mezcla de ambos\". *Este contenido fue reescrito con la asistencia de una inteligencia artificial, basado en información de El País (GDA), y contó con la revisión de la periodista y un editor.",

    "text": "Locals try to cool off in outback town Boulia, as the mercury heads towards 45C. (Supplied: Zacahary Hart)\nScorching temperatures are hitting communities across the east coast of Australia with even hotter conditions and severe storms expected later on Friday and over the weekend.\nMuch of northern Australia is sweltering through heatwave conditions set to peak in some areas on Saturday and endure into the new year.\nOn Queensland’s coast, many residents will ring in 2024 displaced from ruined homes amid a colossal clean-up in the aftermath of this week’s severe storms in the south-east and ex-tropical cyclone Jasper.\nBureau of Meteorology data showed many towns across Queensland sweltering through near-40-degree Celsius heat at 10am on Friday, with hotter temperatures expected over the weekend for some communities.\nOn the coast, Brisbane had reached 37.5C at 1:00pm on Friday while the Gold Coast was expecting to hit 33C, but a seabreeze kept temperatures closer to 30C.\nFurther inland, the mercury rose, with Emerald reaching 36.9C at 1.54pm and Roma topping out at 39.2C at 1.38pm..\nIn the outback, temperatures were tipped to skyrocket to 47C in Birdsville.\nLongreach will be in record-breaking territory if it reaches more than 47C as expected over the weekend —beating the previous maximum temperature of 47.3 from January, 1990.\n“This weekend, a number of locations will reach above 40C, and into the mid-to-high 40s,” said the BOM’s Claire Yeo.\nWest and central Queensland as well as the Top End were set to suffer some of the most extreme heat with Marble Bar in Western Australia expecting the hottest temperature in the country — 48C on Saturday, the Bureau said.\nHealth warnings for the vulnerable Queensland Ambulance Service officer Brad Hardy said hospitals around the state were bracing for an uptick in heat-related illnesses.\nHe urged those susceptible to the heat — the elderly, children and pregnant women — to be aware of signs of heat stress.\n“As soon as you start sweating you’re losing fluids and can rapidly become dehydrated if you’re in these really hot temperatures,” Superintendent Hardy said.\n“You can become restless, flushed in the skin to the point where you stop sweating.\n“That’s extremely dangerous and can be fatal … your organs can start to shut down to keep your brain working and that damage can be immense and irreversible.”\nFor more tips on how to stay safe in a heatwave visit the ABC Emergency website here.\nResidents get creative to keep cool Tried and tested methods like keeping ice blocks handy, hauling out the paddle pool, buckets of water and cool drinks were the go-to for residents trying to stay cool.\nTradesmen in the outback town of Cloncurry used their water trucks to spray neighbours cooling off in backyards and the Gold Coast council offered free entry to the local pools.\nFire stations at Mount Tamborine opened their doors to people who needed an air-conditioned place to cool down.\nIn Birdsville, ranger Don Rowlands said locals had a few tricks for dealing with the hottest time of the year.\n“You start your day early and by 10am, everyone retires to the lounge room and puts on a good movie in the air-conditioning,” he said.\n“The kids run down to the river early in the morning and come home late at night … they’re just swimming all day.”\nNicole Liu, in the outback town of Mount Isa, where temperatures were set to reach 45C over the weekend, said she had to bring her kids to the pool early to beat the stifling heat.\n“You have to come early otherwise you just can’t enjoy it. We’re here at 9.30am and it already feels like you’re standing in an oven,” she said.\nAs an outback local, Ms Liu said residents expected temperatures to be high this time of year, but that the heat “still hits you pretty hard”.\n“We hang around the pool and keep ice blocks handy, crank the aircon…I’m not looking forward to my electricity bill,” she said.\nIced coffees were in hot demand at Nambour cafe Small Change Espresso this morning, with the town expected to reach 37C.\nWorker Alex Atkins said he had noticed fewer customers opting to dine in.\n“A lot more iced coffees than usual,” he said.\n“Because of the heat people are getting takeaways because it’s too hot to sit in here.”\nHe said the store had several large fans running but they were doing little to bring the temperature down.\n“We’ve stocked our fridges with cold water, people are asking for water as soon as they walk in,” he said.\n“It was already hot as soon as we got here and we’ve got fans to work with.”\nHelping animals beat the heat Grazier Josie Angus from the central Queensland community of Clermont was helping her cattle get through 39C temperatures.\nShe said her stock was northern bred and used to high temperatures, but it was still difficult to keep them cool.\n“It’s always an extra challenge,” Ms Angus said.\n“All of our cattle are on heat-load rations and we cool down their ration a bit just to make sure that they’re going to cope with it.”\nThe RSPCA recommends multiple sources of water in shady spots for pets.\nCooling matts, paddle pools and frozen treats are another way to help your furry friend beat the heat.\n“Never leave your dog tied up in the yard or in a hot car during a heatwave,” the RSPCA website warns.\nRain on the way but heat to endure While the hottest day for the northern half of Australia will be Saturday, temperatures will not drop by much over the coming week, the BOM says.\nStorms and rain were predicted for parts of the central west and east coast over the weekend while a chance of rain was forecast for western and north-west Queensland mid-to-late next week.\nWhile the rain would bring some reprieve, it would not do much to ease the heat, Ms Yeo said.\n“Central and western Queensland maximum temperatures unfortunately do not fall below 40 degrees for the remainder of the week.”\nSuperintendent Hardy urged all those in heat-affected areas to take it easy.\n“Temperatures are not just a few degrees above average, they’re up to many degrees above average,” he said.\n“Stay cool and take the risk of heat stress very seriously.”",

National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano emphasized the importance of dialogue and diplomacy while upholding the 2016 Hague ruling invalidating Beijing's claims. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 12-07-2024 10:27 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 10:27 IST The Philippines has firmly opposed the use of force to undermine its interests in the contested South China Sea, emphasizing a non-confrontational approach even as tensions mount. National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano confirmed that both nations have agreed to de-escalate tensions around Second Thomas Shoal, a contentious area. Efforts to reduce friction come after recent confrontations, including allegations that the China Coast Guard intentionally rammed a Philippine navy vessel, injuring a sailor. Despite China's extensive claims over the sea, the Philippines remains committed to upholding the 2016 Hague ruling, which dismissed Beijing's territorial assertions. Ano stressed the importance of maintaining peace and resolving issues through diplomatic means. The European Union and the United States have also called for China to honor the Hague ruling, urging Beijing to cease its destabilizing actions in the disputed waters.

    "text": "市民在新化快速路北段高架桥下的运动场打球。\n近年来，广州深入践行人民城市为人民的理念，将目标瞄准存量大、开发利用有限的桥下空间，通过完善功能、改善交通、提升环境、增加设施，促进桥下空间从单一功能向多元活力空间转变，同时积极探索桥下空间“自我造血”的运营路径，为城市高质量发展打开新空间。\n近日，记者对全市多个桥下空间改造的优秀案例进行了走访，曾经的卫生死角、管理盲点，城市的消极“灰空间”；如今已悄然变身，成为市民健身、遛娃、停车的幸福“新空间”。\n增设体育设施满足健身娱乐\n广州城区公共空间不足、缺乏健身运动场所。桥下空间改造过程建立多方协同机制，政府统筹组织企业、设计师及市民共同参与，通过高效利用桥下空间，弥补了体育设施的不足，为市民提供了充满活力的健身空间。\n在海珠区新化快速路北段高架桥下的一个运动场内，尽管不是休息日，但羽毛球场、网球场上都有“发烧友”在切磋技艺。\n广州市规划和自然资源局表示，新化快速北段体育公园，占地面积约9000平方米，场馆由室内体育场、室外体育场及配套停车区三大区域组成，室内场由15个羽毛球场和乒乓球区组成，室外场则由3个篮球场和2个网球场组成。\n广州交投集团有关负责人表示：“在高架桥下建设工程，首当其冲需要解决的就是防水问题。高架桥之间会有缝隙，我们在路面和桥梁下面都增加了排水槽，相当于进行了双层防护，通过排水槽收集排水统一从排水管中排出。”\n“我们希望通过不断完善设施，为市民提供更多样化的健身选择，满足大家日益增长的运动需求。”广州交投集团有关负责人说。\n2024年11月14日，广州市规划和自然资源局为新化快速桥下空间升级改造示范项目授予广州市桥下空间综合利用示范点牌匾，持续为试点项目提供全流程规划实施的跟踪指导服务。\n配套停车空间满足交通出行\n广州城区同时也存在停车难、公共交通出行配套不足的问题。桥下空间具有良好的区位交通条件，采用低成本微改造方式，利用桥下空间设置停车场、公交场站等交通设施，满足周边地区停车配套和公共交通服务的需要。\n针对奥体中心及周边小区停车配套不足的问题，环城高速奥体段利用有限的桥下空间建设了广州首个AGV立体停车库，有效解决了周边停车难问题，提升了空间利用效率，并为城市交通管理提供了创新方案。“旁边小区有1.8万户居民，整个小区车位配比不足，我们引入AGV智能停车场，将127个传统（路面）车位改造成304个车位的双层停车库，实现了车位139%的增加。”停车场负责人表示。\n记者在现场看到，停车系统共配置10个标准化停车交接单元，系统可根据高峰时段车流特征动态调整入口/出口单元配置比例，车主只需要将车开到停车区，系统就能自动将车送往车库，实现车辆存取效能最优化，整体车辆存取效率可达每分钟3台。\n变身桥下公园满足生活品质\n南岗河悦动公园位于广州市黄埔区北师大二纵路桥下，此前杂草丛生的桥下空间经过改造后，变成了周边居民的遛娃、休闲胜地，以及游客的打卡地。\n几百米的桥下空间，铺设了蓝橙相间的地面，设置了别有趣味的儿童攀爬区、沙池、滑梯、摇椅、有氧健身设施等，与桥下流水潺潺的南岗河，以及对面悠然而过的有轨电车，构成了一幅人与自然和谐共生的优美画卷。\n“我们是坐有轨电车过来的，小红书上专门有这里的打卡攻略。”前来游玩的王女士说，“没想到桥下公园也这么美，空间开阔、空气又好。”悦动公园里除了众多免费设施外，也有收费的儿童乐园、大型蹦床和碧道骑行租车点，“项目目前处于孵化期，我们希望通过5年或者10年的长期运营进行打造。随着人气的增加，消费水平也随之上涨。”悦动公园营运单位负责人朱经理表示。\n提升景观品质满足环境提升\n桥下空间闲置或利用不当，往往对城市形象和地区景观环境产生负面影响，降低居民的生活舒适度。通过采取绿化美化、艺术小品、文化墙绘等景观提升措施，将桥下空间“变废为宝”，为城市增添色彩和生机。\n东濠涌高架桥下空间通过桥身涂装翻新、驳岸砌块改造、灯光照明提升、公共艺术装置等品质提升工程，营造出自然、生态、开阔、富有人文气息的景观效果，成为广州老城里一道亮丽的风景线。\n黄埔区香雪大道桥下空间以梅花为主题，在桥梁涂装、地面铺装、围蔽装饰等改造中融入传统文化香韵元素，展示地区文化特色，提升周边景观环境品质。\n（广州日报全媒体记者杜娟 通讯员穗规资宣摄影报道）",

    "text": "The Africa Policy Research Institute, in collaboration with the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Foundation, HOMEF, Centre for Social Studies and Development Agenda, and supported by the Ford Foundation, held a high-level dialogue on Nigeria’s energy transition.\nExperts highlighted Nigeria’s energy landscape, marred by environmental degradation and socio-economic disparities, particularly in the Niger Delta.\nDecades of oil exploration have destroyed farmlands, polluted water bodies, and degraded air quality, severely impacting local communities.\nMr. Nnimmo Bassey, Executive Director of HOMEF, stressed the need for transparency and accountability in the energy sector.\n“Federal, state, and community engagement with companies is essential to hold them accountable for their activities,” he said.\n“It’s imperative we address the root causes of the oil and gas sector crisis. Energy companies and governments must take responsibility for their actions and fully engage with community members,” Mr Bassey added.\nHe emphasised clear conversations between the government, energy companies, and communities to outline stakeholder roles and accountability.\nIn a panel discussion moderated by Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, panelists agreed on broadening Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP).\nMs. Tengi George-Ikoli, Comrade Ndieze Ikechukwu Agunwa, and Lanre Sasore called for a more people-centred approach to sourcing energy resources. They believe this would prevent Nigeria from suffering high levels of energy poverty and climate change impacts.\nDarren Walker, President of the Ford Foundation, urged communities to hold elites accountable. “There can be no justice without community input,” he said.\n“It’s time to challenge elites globally and ask for their accountability in creating and contributing to Nigeria’s extractive community challenges.”\nJoseph Onoja, Director General of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, emphasized the need for government action.\n“We must address the injustice and non-inclusion of locals in the renewable energy era. Energy mineral sourcing often destroys biodiversity-rich areas, impacting locals. We must approach the new energy transition process holistically to avoid further injustice,” he stated.",

    "text": "Tories tout education pledges while attacking Labour’s private school tax plan Rishi Sunak said Labour’s policy would ‘see class sizes soar’, a claim disputed by Sir Keir Starmer’s party. The Tories have repeated a raft of education pledges, including the expansion of free childcare and a school mobile phones ban, while attacking Labour’s plan to impose VAT on private schools. Rishi Sunak claimed Labour’s policy would “see class sizes soar” as he touted the Conservatives’ plans to “give our children the skills they need to succeed in the future”. His party is pointing to its education offer as polls continue to show it trailing far behind Labour with less than a week to go until the General Election. The Tories highlighted their plans to: – Roll out an expansion of funded childcare, giving parents of children older than nine months 30 hours a week from next year – Ban mobile phones during the school day – Improve school attendance including by legislating to create a register of children not in class – Hire more teachers by expanding the recruitment and retention premium – Deliver the Advanced British Standard – Create 100,000 more apprenticeships a year by shutting down “rip-off” university courses – Deliver the lifelong learning entitlement The party claimed that Labour’s plan to remove the VAT exemption for private schools to pay for more state teachers would push an estimated 40,000 private school pupils into state schools. Sir Keir Starmer has denied the assertion, pointing to research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggesting it is unlikely that state school class sizes will swell as a result of the policy. The Prime Minister said: “Education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet to improve our children’s life chances. That’s why since 2010 we have focused relentlessly on driving up school standards – with English children now the best readers in the western world thanks to the reforms we Conservatives have put in place. “We have a clear plan to go further by creating 100,000 new apprenticeships and introducing the new Advanced British Standard to give our children the skills they need to succeed in the future. “That’s the choice at this election between the Conservatives with a strong track record and a plan to go further, and Labour who have let children down in Labour-run Wales and whose schools tax would see class sizes soar.” Education Secretary Gillian Keegan added: “Our relentless drive to improve school standards has been one of our best achievements of the last 14 years. Millions of children now have a better start in life because of our education reforms.” Mr Sunak is expected to promote the proposals on campaign visits in the North East on Friday. Labour’s shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said: “This is desperate nonsense from the Conservative Party. “On their watch childcare costs are soaring, school standards falling as teachers leave our schools in their droves, and apprenticeships for young people have halved. “Labour will drive high and rising standards for every child, with thousands of new teachers, mental health support in every school, careers advice and work experience for every young person. “We will back business with the flexibility they need to deliver high-quality apprenticeships and short, modular training that will deliver the skills our economy needs to grow. “On July 4, it’s time to turn the page, end the chaos and deliver the change that Britain needs.”",
