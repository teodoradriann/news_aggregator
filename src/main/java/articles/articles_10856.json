    "title": "The Shocking Truth About Cereal and Orange Juice (Your Arteries Are in Danger)",
    "text": "Many of us start our day with what we believe is a wholesome breakfast, but research reveals a startling truth about one of America’s most popular morning meal combinations. An astonishing 84% of Americans regularly consume a breakfast duo that may be significantly increasing their risk of cardiovascular problems.\nThe Culprits on Your Breakfast Table The seemingly innocent combination of cereal and orange juice has emerged as a potential threat to cardiovascular health. While these breakfast staples might appear nutritious on the surface, their combined impact on our bodies tells a different story.\nThe Cereal Conundrum\nYour morning bowl of cereal harbors a concerning secret. With up to 29 grams of carbohydrates per serving, most cereals pack a significant carbohydrate punch. What’s more concerning is that many people pour well beyond the recommended serving size, multiplying their carbohydrate intake. Even varieties marketed as “heart-healthy” can cause dangerous blood sugar spikes.\nThe Orange Juice Dilemma\nThat glass of orange juice alongside your cereal isn’t doing your health any favors. A single 8-ounce serving contains 26 grams of carbohydrates. Unlike whole oranges, juice lacks essential fiber, leading to rapid sugar absorption. This combination can elevate blood sugar levels above 140 mg/dL, entering a danger zone for arterial damage.\nUnderstanding the Impact The science behind this harmful combination is clear. When consumed together, these foods trigger a cascade of effects in your body: dramatic blood sugar spikes, followed by insulin surges, leading to increased arterial inflammation. Over time, this pattern contributes to plaque accumulation and arterial hardening.\nRelated Video : 7 Nutrients to Remove Calcium Plaque from Your Arteries\nMaking Better Choices Fortunately, there are numerous delicious alternatives that can start your day on a healthier note. Consider switching to:\nEggs paired with fresh avocado Greek yogurt topped with fresh berries Steel-cut oats garnished with nuts Time-restricted eating patterns Your breakfast choices set the foundation for your entire day’s health. By making informed decisions about your morning meal, you can actively protect your cardiovascular health rather than compromise it.\nRemember, small changes in your breakfast routine can lead to significant improvements in your long-term health outcomes. The power to protect your heart health lies in the choices you make each morning.\ncitations [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRwVxuPCzsc\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRwVxuPCzsc\n[3] https://fairviewadc.com/adult-day-care/list-of-the-worst-foods-that-clog-arteries/\n[4] https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-foods-cleanse-the-arteries\n[5] https://theconversation.com/worried-about-the-health-effects-of-the-sugar-in-your-breakfast-cereal-little-has-changed-since-the-days-of-unfrosted-the-pop-tarts-movie-233633\n[6] https://www.usavascularcenters.com/blog/avoid-foods-lower-risk-pad/\n[7] https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/study-explains-why-food-high-in-saturated-fat-may-lead-to-plaque-build-up-in-arteries/2021/08\n[8] https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/breakfast-foods-to-avoid\n[9] https://www.livestrong.com/article/76792-list-foods-clog-arteries/",

    "title": "I’m buying FTSE 100 star BAE Systems as it pulls off deals worth billions",
    "text": "Investor looking at stock graph on a tablet with their finger hovering over the Buy button\nThe FTSE 100’s biggest defence firm, BAE Systems (LSE:BA), keeps pulling in massive multi-billion pound sales. Demand for its military tech has reached record highs.\nSo it has leapfrogged my other immediate buys for my Stocks and Shares ISA.\nJust weeks before the end of 2023, it won a contract worth $8.8bn (£6.94bn) over 10 years. This is to maintain and operate a US Army ammunition plant in the eastern US state of Tennessee.\nA $92m, five-year deal followed to produce air traffic control systems for the US Navy.\nThen a $35m award, again from the US, to allow engineers to build semiconductor chips for fighter planes at its base in Hampshire.\nRicher sounds The Wall Street Journal reported in early January 2024 that BAE Systems had inked a deal to refurbish gun emplacement parts for Ukraine.\nThese M777 howitzers are used by ground forces across the globe, including Australia, Canada, and the US.\nThe size of the BAE deal is not known. But public sources suggest each artillery piece is delivered for between $2m and $4m.\nI could go on.\nMore Qinetiq? Last year I wrote how I picked up shares in the £1.6bn UK defence firm Qinetiq, instead of BAE Systems. I stand by that decision, since I am up around 30% on that purchase to date.\nBut it is becoming harder and harder to ignore BAE Systems.\nEspecially since it is one of only a handful of UK companies to increase its dividend payouts for 24 years in a row.\nWarring parties It has not always been plain sailing. Older readers may recall the crisis of 1991 when the BAE share price plunged from 600p to 100p. The previous chairman, Professor Sir Roland Smith, tired to sell off swathes of BAE property to drum up the cash to buy UK weapons manufacturer Royal Ordnance.\nBut when recession hit and property prices plummeted, the chairman found himself out on his ear. It took years for the BAE share price to recover.\nCost overruns on contracts to build Astute submarines and Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft in the early 2000s also saw shares drop dramatically.\nThe Ministry of Defence initially refused to step in to modify the fixed-price, £5.3bn contracts. But negotiations continued, and BAE avoided writing down the value of the contracts with an additional £700m cash injection from the UK government.\nSo headline numbers for contracts do not always work out to be the cash cow they may seem.\nFuture perfection However, I see more growth for BAE Systems in future: in space, no less.\nIn 2023, the company snapped up Ball Corporation’s aerospace arm for $5.6bn, beating out other defence rivals. This will add military satellite, spacecraft, and extraterrestrial sensor technology to its stable. This move is likely to boost US earnings still further. America’s military forces already provide the company the majority of its revenue.\nBAE upgraded its earnings outlook by double-digits for 2023, quite the move for a company that has grown to be worth £32bn.\nThose full-year earnings are due out on 21 February. So while my wife’s Valentine’s present may be somewhat underwhelming (from her perspective?), buying her BAE Systems shares could be the best choice I ever make.\nShould you invest £1,000 in BAE Systems right now? When investing expert Mark Rogers has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the flagship Motley Fool Share Advisor newsletter he has run for nearly a decade has provided thousands of paying members with top stock recommendations from the UK and US markets.\nAnd right now, Mark thinks there are 6 standout stocks that investors should consider buying. Want to see if BAE Systems made the list?\nSee the 6 stocks\nMore reading\nTom Rodgers has positions in QinetiQ Group Plc. The Motley Fool UK has recommended BAE Systems and QinetiQ Group Plc.

    "text": "DU Syllabus Change: दिल्ली यूनिवर्सिटी के पॉलिटिकल साइंस के सिलेबस से पाकिस्तान और चीन से जुड़े विषय हटाए जाने पर विवाद बढ़ रहा है। शिक्षकों में इस फैसले को लेकर अलग-अलग मत है, कुछ इसे 'शैक्षणिक सेंसरशिप' तो कुछ 'राष्ट्रहित' बता रहे हैं। जानिए\nDU Syllabus Controversy: दिल्ली यूनिवर्सिटी (DU) में पोस्टग्रेजुएट पॉलिटिकल साइंस के कुछ इंपोर्टेंट ऑप्शनल सब्जेक्ट्स को हटाने के फैसले ने एक नई बहस को जन्म दे दिया है। यूनिवर्सिटी की स्टैंडिंग कमेटी फॉर एकेडमिक मैटर्स की बैठक में ‘इस्लाम एंड इंटरनेशनल रिलेशंस’, ‘पाकिस्तान एंड द वर्ल्ड’, ‘चाइना इन द कंटेम्पररी वर्ल्ड’ और ‘स्टेट एंड सोसाइटी इन पाकिस्तान’ जैसे चार महत्वपूर्ण विषयों को हटाने का प्रस्ताव पास कर दिया गया है। वहीं, एक और पेपर ‘रिलिजियस नेशनलिज्म एंड पॉलिटिकल वायलेंस’ पर अगली बैठक 1 जुलाई को होगी, जिसमें फैसला होगा। इस बदलाव पर शिक्षकों के बीच तीखी प्रतिक्रिया देखने को मिल रही है। कुछ लोग इसे \"शैक्षणिक सेंसरशिप\" बता रहे हैं, जबकि कुछ इसे \"राष्ट्रहित में जरूरी बदलाव\" मान रहे हैं।\nपाकिस्तान-चीन को हटाना अकादमिक दृष्टि से गलत: प्रोफेसर मोनामी सिन्हा\nकमेटी की सदस्य और प्रोफेसर मोनामी सिन्हा ने इस फैसले पर खुलकर नाराजगी जताई। उन्होंने कहा कि पाकिस्तान और चीन जैसे देशों का अध्ययन आज की भू-राजनीतिक स्थिति को समझने के लिए बेहद जरूरी है। अगर हम अपने पड़ोसी देशों को पढ़ाना ही बंद कर देंगे, तो छात्रों की सोच संकीर्ण हो जाएगी। इस तरह के बदलाव आलोचनात्मक सोच को खत्म कर सकते हैं। सिन्हा ने यह भी कहा कि सोशलॉजी और जियोग्राफी के सिलेबस में भी जाति, सांप्रदायिक हिंसा और समलैंगिक संबंधों जैसे मुद्दों को हटा दिया गया है, जो बेहद चिंता का विषय है।\nभारत-केंद्रित सिलेबस होना चाहिए: प्रोफेसर हरेंद्र तिवारी का पक्ष\nवहीं, कमेटी के ही एक अन्य सदस्य प्रोफेसर हरेंद्र तिवारी ने इस फैसले का बचाव करते हुए कहा कि सिलेबस को अब भारत-प्रथम दृष्टिकोण से तैयार किया जा रहा है। उन्होंने कहा कि सिर्फ इस्लाम और इंटरनेशनल रिलेशंस पर पेपर क्यों? हिंदू धर्म या सिख धर्म पर क्यों नहीं? हम ऐसा कोर्स चाहते हैं जो छात्रों के साथ-साथ देश के हित में भी हो। उन्होंने यह भी स्पष्ट किया कि जब तक हटाए गए पेपर्स में संतुलित और राष्ट्रहित से जुड़ा कंटेंट नहीं जोड़ा जाता, तब तक उन्हें वापस नहीं लाया जाएगा।\n1 जुलाई को अगली बैठक, शिक्षा की दिशा पर फिर होगा मंथन\nअगली बैठक 1 जुलाई को होनी है, जिसमें ‘धार्मिक राष्ट्रवाद और राजनीतिक हिंसा’ विषय को लेकर चर्चा की जाएगी। यह देखना दिलचस्प होगा कि शिक्षा नीति में बदलाव का यह दौर छात्रों के ज्ञान को और समृद्ध करता है या महत्वपूर्ण मुद्दों से उनकी दूरी बढ़ाता है।",

    "text": "Diablo 4 Season 7 change drastically buffs fan-favorite Necromancer build Cande Maldonado ❘ Published: 2025-01-16T21:27:36 Dexerto Diablo 4’s Season 7 patch aims to fix long-standing frustrations for players with summoning features, which means excellent news for a specific Necromancer build.\nFor months, summoner players endured the pain of broken mechanics. Minion AI, especially skeletons, often failed to engage enemies effectively, standing idle during crucial moments.\nSurvivability was a joke – summons dropped like flies, forcing constant resummoning. Damage output lagged far behind other builds, leaving players scrambling for corpses just to stay in the fight. It’s a shame considering that summons are an iconic part of the Necromancer class.\nArticle continues after ad During the Diablo 4 Season 7 Campfire Chat , devs showcased the sweeping summons update, which finally addresses these issues.\nMinion Necro is set to dominate Season 7 Blizzard made a massive change by attributing all summon damage directly to the player.\nTimestamp: 52:55 According to the patch notes , this update “standardizes interactions across classes, ensuring damage from summons can trigger all Lucky Hit effects, damage modifiers, and multipliers.” In short, summoners can now scale damage more reliably and consistently.\nArticle continues after ad The Necromancer class benefits most from this overhaul. Every skeleton, golem, and ultimate skill now fully integrates with player damage bonuses, making minion builds far deadlier.\nArticle continues after ad Class Game Designer Charles Dunn confirmed, “Summoner Necromancers are at their peak this season.” Systems Designer Aislyn Hall even joked, “Minion stonks are absolutely going up.” Finally, Necros can dominate with their undead army, unleashing hordes of high-damage summons that synergize with gear and skills.\nBut it’s not just Necromancers getting a boost. Summons for Druids , Sorcerers , Rogues , and Barbarians also received updates.\nDruid Companions, Sorcerer Conjurations, Rogue Shadow Clones, and Barbarian Ancients now fall under the same “summons” umbrella, ensuring consistency across all classes. Lucky Hit procs and other effects that previously ignored summons now work seamlessly, making every summoner build more effective.\nRelated: Diablo 4 Season 7 needs to offer something fresh after Vessel of Hatred Article continues after ad While Spiritborn still holds the title of the strongest class, these changes bring summoners back into the spotlight. Diablo 4 Season 7 also introduces Witch Powers and a flying pet, adding convenience to the Tree of Whispers grind.\nArticle continues after ad keep reading Related Topics Diablo 4 About The Author Cande Maldonado is a Games Writer on Dexerto's US team.
