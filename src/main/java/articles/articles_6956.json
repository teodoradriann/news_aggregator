The Boeing 777 made the bumpy landing at London’s Heathrow airport on Wednesday, as Storm Gerrit caused heavy winds to batter parts of the UK. According to Big Jet TV there were “strong, gusting crosswind elements catching out even the most seasoned pilots!” Travel was disrupted, and houses and vehicles were damaged in some places, with emergency services working to clear the affected areas.

Well, now you do! Airlineratings.com was developed to provide everyone in the world with a one-stop shop for everything related to airlines, formed by a team of aviation editors, who have forensically researched nearly every airline in the world. Our rating system is rated from one to seven stars on safety – with seven being the highest ranking. Within each airline, you will find the country of origin, airline code, booking URL and seat map information. The rating system takes into account a number of different factors related to audits from aviation’s governing bodies, lead associations as well as the airline’s own safety data. Every airline has a safety rating breakdown so you can see exactly how they rate. Over 230 of the airlines on the site that carry 99 per cent of the world’s passengers have a product rating. Given that low-cost, regional and full-service carriers are so different we have constructed a different rating system for each which can be found within each airline.",

    "title": "Abb, niente accordo. Salta l’intesa azienda-sindacati su cassa e uscite",
    "text": "San Giovanni (Arezzo), 29 novembre 2024 – Fumata nera per Abb . Sarà necessario un nuovo incontro tra parti sociali e azienda per gestire la trattativa sugli ammortizzatori sociali in luogo della procedura di licenziamento collettivo per 33 dipendenti a tempo indeterminato prospettata dalla proprietà lo scorso 14 novembre. Le Rsu di Abb E-Mobility , insieme a Fiom Cgil, Fim Cisl e Uilm Uil, dopo il vertice di ieri mattina con l’azienda, hanno fatto sapere che “sono stati affrontati aspetti tecnici che hanno evidenziato alcune distanze tra le parti. Il confronto entrerà più nel dettaglio nel prossimo incontro previsto nella mattina del giorno 5.12.2024 al quale seguirà un ulteriore comunicato per eventuali aggiornamenti”.\nSiamo ancora in una fase interlocutoria, oltre che delicata, in cui sul tavolo si ragiona soprattutto di aspetti tecnici. Ma per il momento la quadratura del cerchio non è stata trovata e si scenderà nel dettaglio la prossima settimana. Nel frattempo si è tenuto a San Giovanni l’atteso Consiglio comunale con all’ordine del giorno le comunicazioni del sindaco alla cittadinanza sullo stato della vertenza. Valentina Vadi ha sottolineato come l’azienda ad inizio mese abbia comunicato ai lavoratori che la multinazionale nel suo complesso ha investito molto e si è specializzata nella vendita di nuovi prodotti, ma al contempo questa crescita si è inserita in un contesto internazionale di difficoltà per il settore dell’elettrico.\nApprofondisci: Vertenza Abb E-Mobility. Le istituzioni sangiovannesi incontrano i sindacati\nPer questo motivo il Ceo di Abb ha prospettato una manovra fatta di tagli ai costi vivi del gruppo, rappresentati dal personale dipendente. Per lo stabilimento di San Giovanni questo si sarebbe tradotto nel licenziamento di 33 lavoratori della cosiddetta “operation”, ossia personale impiegatizio di varia natura, senza intaccare il settore della ricerca e sviluppo e la produzione.\nDopo lo sciopero del 18 novembre, il colosso della green economy ha manifestato un’apertura al dialogo. “In questa fase - ha sottolineato Vadi - dobbiamo supportare i sindacati rimanendo cauti e prudenti e allo stesso tempo chiedere che l’azienda faccia chiarezza sulle strategie da attuare sul sito di San Giovanni, se necessario chiedendo l’intervento della Regione”. L’opposizione si è dimostrata invece insoddisfatta, soprattutto dopo la bocciatura delle due mozioni presentate da San Giovanni Civica che chiedevano di istituire un tavolo istituzionale sulla crisi dello stabilimento e di convocare una seduta aperta del parlamentino di fronte ai cancelli della fabbrica. “La scelta della maggioranza è purtroppo gravissima - ha tuonato il gruppo guidato da Lisa Vannelli - inspiegabile e lesiva per i lavoratori che rischiano di essere licenziati e per avere chiarezza sul futuro dell’azienda. Siamo sincerante molto preoccupati e faremo tutto ciò che la legge ed i regolamenti comunali ci permettono per far sì che tutti in questa crisi si assumano le loro responsabilità”.",

    "title": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals - OPB",
    "text": "Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Illinois, and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they’re too high. And for name-brand drugs, that’s often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [ generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss “for some time” and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn’s CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at the University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances of medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn’s ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for Ashe, Watauga, Avery, Caldwell, Burke, and Alexander counties until 1 p.m. Saturday. This advisory brings the threat of freezing rain, sleet and snow into the mountains, foothills and northern piedmont.\nWCNC Charlotte Chief Meteorologist Brad Panovich says there won't be much winter weather at all with this system. For the Charlotte area, we're only expected a very cold, miserable rain on Saturday.\nPanovich says the biggest risks with this system will be along Interstate 40 and northwest, with the potential for freezing rain, sleet and ice accumulations up to 0.1-0.15\". Totals up to a quarter inch are not likely do to the temperatures being close to freezing.\nThe ice accumulation totals for the Foothills and Mountains could range from a trace to 0.2\" of freezing rain. Here are the problems ice can cause. Sleet mixing in could likely bring these totals way down. @wcnc pic.twitter.com/AWieEyQ4Qx\n— Chris Mulcahy (@YOURWEATHERMAN) January 5, 2024 Those areas include Asheville, Lake Lure, Morganton, McDowell County, Ashe County, Watauga County, Burke County, Caldwell County, Alexander County and Wilkes County. Charlotte could see a brief mixing or change over to sleet before sunrise. By mid to late morning there is even a chance for thunderstorms.\n\"There could be minor adjustments, but I will say overall, I expect this to be a minor event,\" Panovich said. \"It's an inconvenient Saturday morning for travel in these areas for about a six- or seven-hour window. Other than that, we're not expecting any power outages, we're not expecting trees to come down and we're not expecting a huge, significant ice storm, snowstorm or anything like that.\"\nRELATED: Brad Panovich's winter snow outlook\nFor the winter lovers out there, we get your frustration. Charlotte just recorded its first calendar year without even a trace of snow . That record dates back all the way to 1878. So if you love snow and wintry weather, you're probably getting antsy. So let's get to it.\nClick here to sign up for the daily WCNC Charlotte newsletter\nMore Videos Next up in 5\nExample video title will go here for this video\nNext up in 5\nExample video title will go here for this video\nIce, ice baby Panovich said the primary reason this won't be a big snow maker or winter storm is the lack of cold air. Panovich said that air is expected to move out quickly. Some of it will be trapped against the mountains, which is why the biggest ice risk is in the foothills, because the Charlotte area won't have enough cold air for anything besides rain.\n\"Early on Saturday we could see a quick glazing of ice but because the high pressure is gone, and now the winds are switching around to the southeast, we're going to see things warm up,\" Panovich said.\nYou also have to take into consideration that freezing rain warms the atmosphere. When you cool rain enough to make ice, that energy goes into the atmosphere, raising the temperature, Panovich explained. As a result, there's less cold air and the freezing rain transitions to regular rain.\n\"Right now the Boone area, I think it starts to snow, changes to ice, and yes, even rain,\" Panovich said. \"Hickory, this is the area where we see ice the longest. So think Morganton, Lenoir, Taylorsville and into the Statesville area. It changes to rain for Gastonia and Charlotte and the surrounding areas. Around the Mecklenburg metro area, that's where we'll see a brief mix of ice in the morning and by 8 or 9 o'clock it changes to rain. For Monroe and Rock Hill, I think it's just solid rain.\"\n.",
