    "text": "DALLAS, N.C. — Parents in Gaston County are dealing with [problems getting their kids to and from school](/article/news/education/charlotte-mecklenburg-schools-bus-lateness-8-14-2024/275-b2e2be88-f6f3-4ce4-a88c-8d8691fbf1d6). Many are frustrated with the transportation issues from the school district that have caused students to arrive at school hours late. Kevin Arevalo-Daszkiewicz has a daughter who attends middle school in Gaston County. But the first few days have been an issue. “She's waited over four hours in the last two days for the bus to come pick her up,\" Arevalo-Daszkiewicz said. His seventh-grade daughter has missed the first bell for consecutive days to start the school year. “Every email we've gotten leading up to this saying that education promptly starts at 8:30 and they make it seem like a really big deal,\" he said. \"And here we are, at 10 o'clock, waiting on a school bus.\" Arevalo-Daszkiewicz reached out to the school several times, and they finally shared some details with him. “They're supposed to pick up my son, first take him down the road, drop him off at school,\" Arevalo-Daszkiewicz said. \"Then she comes back and starts picking up the middle school kids.\" A spokesperson from the school district told [WCNC Charlotte](/): \"The school has experienced some bus-related issues and is working to ensure there are enough bus drivers; there is accuracy in scheduling students to buses; and there is better communication between parents and the school about which students are relying on bus transportation. Also, there is traffic congestion in the area (due in part to some construction at the school entrance) that is causing delays. This is a good opportunity to remind parents about being patient and understanding during the first week of school as the school works on having drivers for all the routes, adjusting routes as needed, and making any necessary changes based on ridership.\" Arevalo-Daszkiewicz hopes the issue can be resolved to prevent his daughter from missing any more classes.

    "title": "BRICS denounces ‘illegal’ Western sanctions, calls for global cooperation and justice",
    "text": "The BRICS nations-Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa-have collectively denounced Western-imposed sanctions, characterizing them as unlawful, disruptive, and harmful to global economic stability. In a joint statement adopted at the 16th BRICS Summit, held in Kazan, Russia, the group of emerging economies reiterated their opposition to sanctions that they described as politically motivated and counterproductive to international development. The BRICS bloc condemned unilateral sanctions, arguing that such measures violate international law, the United Nations (UN) Charter, and the principles of free and fair global trade.\nThe joint declaration, titled “Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security,” emphasized that sanctions imposed outside of the UN framework jeopardize not only the targeted nations but the broader global economic system. This position reflects growing discontent among BRICS nations regarding what they view as the misuse of sanctions by Western countries, especially against Russia in the wake of its military actions in Ukraine.\nThe BRICS leaders expressed “deep concern” over the far-reaching impacts of what they termed “unilateral coercive measures,” pointing to their adverse effects on global economic growth, international trade, and the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The declaration identified sanctions as a major threat to key sectors such as energy, health, food security, and environmental sustainability.\nThe Kazan Declaration elaborated on the wide-ranging consequences of these sanctions, explaining how they exacerbate poverty and hinder progress toward eradicating hunger and achieving environmental targets. With the global economy already reeling from multiple crises-including the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and climate change-sanctions have only amplified these challenges. In particular, the BRICS nations argued that the poorest and most vulnerable populations bear the brunt of the economic fallout from sanctions, further exacerbating inequality and developmental imbalances across the world.\nThe BRICS bloc has consistently advocated for multilateralism and global cooperation, values that are at the heart of their criticism of Western-imposed sanctions. The Kazan Declaration emphasized that these punitive measures violate the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and undermine the principles upon which the international economic order is built. According to the declaration, sanctions not only harm individual nations but also threaten the integrity of the multilateral trading system, creating instability in global markets and impeding the flow of goods, services, and capital.\nBy flouting international law and the principles of the UN Charter, unilateral sanctions have fostered an environment of distrust and fragmentation in international relations, the BRICS leaders claimed. This sentiment echoes broader criticisms that have emerged from the Global South, where many nations argue that sanctions often serve the geopolitical interests of powerful Western countries at the expense of global stability and fairness.\nA key concern highlighted by the BRICS leaders is the humanitarian impact of sanctions. The Kazan Declaration stressed that the imposition of unilateral coercive measures disproportionately affects the general population of targeted nations, particularly those living in poverty and vulnerable situations. Sanctions restrict access to essential goods, services, and financial resources, curbing the ability of governments to provide for their citizens.\nThe document also drew attention to the human rights implications of sanctions, noting that they undermine the right to development and contribute to long-term socio-economic degradation. For the BRICS nations, the humanitarian toll of sanctions cannot be justified by their political motives. Instead, they call for the removal of such measures in favor of dialogue and diplomacy.\nThe context of the BRICS summit in Kazan is significant, as the issue of sanctions has taken on heightened urgency since Russia became the target of unprecedented Western punitive measures following its invasion of Ukraine. The United States, the European Union, and their allies have imposed a record number of sanctions on Russia, freezing an estimated $300 billion in state assets and targeting key sectors such as energy, mining, and finance. These measures, according to Moscow, are illegal and violate international law.\nThe Kazan Declaration underscored BRICS’ support for Russia in its opposition to these sanctions, with member nations continuing to strengthen their economic cooperation with Moscow despite the risk of secondary sanctions. For instance, BRICS countries have expanded trade and investment with Russia in areas such as energy, agriculture, and defense, circumventing Western restrictions.\nAlthough Western nations have attempted to isolate Russia economically, there is growing recognition that the sanctions have not achieved their intended outcomes. Some high-ranking Western officials have acknowledged that the sanctions are not as effective as initially hoped. Russian resilience, coupled with its deepening ties with BRICS nations and other non-Western countries, has allowed Moscow to withstand the economic pressure. This has led some policymakers to question the utility of imposing further sanctions, as the scope for additional restrictions narrows.\nAt the same time, Russia has responded to Western sanctions with countermeasures, including travel bans on Western officials and other retaliatory actions. This tit-for-tat approach has contributed to a broader geopolitical standoff, with little indication that sanctions are pushing Russia toward compliance with Western demands.\nThe Kazan Declaration is a clear indication of BRICS’ intention to present a united front against what they see as the overreach of Western sanctions. The group has deepened its economic ties and bolstered intra-BRICS cooperation, demonstrating its ability to navigate the complexities of the global economic order while resisting Western pressure. By fostering alternative trade routes, financial mechanisms, and political alliances, BRICS has shown that it is capable of maintaining resilience in the face of Western economic and political dominance.\nAs the world continues to grapple with the effects of geopolitical tensions and economic fragmentation, the BRICS bloc’s stance on sanctions will likely shape future global debates on the use of economic measures as a tool of political coercion. The Kazan Declaration’s call for the elimination of unilateral sanctions underscores a growing demand for a fairer, more just international order-one that respects the sovereignty and development rights of all nations.\nThe BRICS nations’ rejection of unilateral Western sanctions reflects a deep-seated concern over the negative consequences of such measures on global development, trade, and human rights. The Kazan Declaration is a powerful statement against the misuse of sanctions as a political tool and highlights the need for a more equitable and multilateral approach to addressing global challenges. As BRICS continues to assert its role in shaping the international economic and political landscape, the world may see an intensification of efforts to curb the use of sanctions and promote cooperation over confrontation.\nPlease follow Blitz on Google News Channel",
