    "title": "Wrong, Kansas City Star, Climate Change Isn’t Worsening Weather in Kansas or Missouri",
    "text": "The Kansas City Star ran an opinion piece claiming climate change is already making weather more extreme in Kansas and Missouri. This is false. There is no data supporting the claim that either flooding or drought, two specific extreme weather events cited in the story, are worse now than they have been historically. Almost all the records for such events in both states were set nearly a century or more ago, when global average temperatures were cooler. Joel Mathis, the writer of the Kansas City Star story, “ [We’re watching the climate change in Kansas and Missouri. Why don’t more of us care?](https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article283527298.html),” opines: Climate change is already taking a toll on Kansas and Missouri, and not just in the form of wintertime vegetation. Both states are enduring long-running droughts that have challenged the region’s farmers and forced some communities to start hoarding their drinking water. That’s probably just the beginning. … Climate change is going to make the extremes more extreme — more intense rain and snowstorms, but also more extended periods of drought. Our big swings will get bigger and more destructive. But Mathis’ sees an even worse problem, in particular, that the majority of people aren’t that concerned about climate change. “Last week, Heatmap News reported its new poll found that Midwesterners are ‘consistently blasé about climate change,’” writes Mathis. “Fifty-two percent of folks in our region — a slim majority, but a majority nonetheless — say warming ‘poses little or no risk to their region.’” The residents of those two states are right to be unconcerned about climate change making their states’ respective weather worse, since historical evidence and data show that neither drought nor flooding amid recent decades of modest warming are worse than they have been historically. Indeed, as Mathis himself notes, Kansas and Missouri are not strangers to droughts, floods, and rapidly changing weather extremes. “The Midwest is already a ‘high variability’ weather region,” writes Mathis, who discussed this fact with Chuck Rice, a professor of soil microbiology at Kansas State University who served on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. “Think about all the times you’ve heard the joke that if you don’t like the weather around here ‘just wait five minutes.’” Although it is true that parts of [Kansas](https://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/PIC/PIC35.pdf) and [Missouri](https://www.drought.gov/dews/missouri-river-basin#:~:text=In%20the%20Missouri%20River%20Basin,wreaked%20havoc%20on%20the%20MRB.) are currently suffering from various degrees of drought, it is not a long-term drought, nor is it historically severe. A short-term drought is no evidence of climate change. Droughts in the early and mid-twentieth century, 70 and 90 years of global warming ago, were more prolonged and severe than the droughts experienced in either state since the beginning of the 21st century. Since official record keeping began, Kansas and Missouri both experienced their most sustained droughts in the 1930s, only to both also experience a sustained drought again in the 1950s. Longer term records developed from proxy data show even more severe and sustained droughts, multiple decades long, have not been uncommon throughout the region’s history. What’s true of drought across Kansas and Missouri is also true of excessive rainfall and flooding. [Kansas](https://climate.k-state.edu/news/stories/2016/06/climate_basics_5/image1.gif) experienced its worst flood in 1844; Missouri’s largest recorded flood was 1785, with the flood year of 1844 being its second greatest flood. More [costly damage](https://www.weather.gov/mbrfc/flood#:~:text=The%20flood%20of%20June%201844,to%2027%20inches%20at%20Ft.) has been done by floods in both Missouri and Kansas since then, in 1903, 1951, 1993, 1998, and 2007. But the reason that more people and property were harmed by the more recent floods is not higher rainfall totals or deeper flood waters, but rather purely demographics. More people and development had taken place in the areas flooded than existed in the 19th and early 20th centuries when heavier flooding occurred. Neither recent rainfall totals nor floodwater depth have been greater in the 21st century than in the past. Neither a single flood event, no matter how severe, nor single instances of drought, no matter how widely covered in the media, are evidence climate change is making weather in Kansas or Missouri worse or less predictable. Only a long-term sustained trend of either or both types of weather events might implicate climate change in weather changes, but there are no such worsening trends for either state. In short, data provide no evidence that climate change is making weather worse in Kansas or Missouri, so residents there are displaying common sense when they downplay the threat of climate change in their lives. The media should follow the public’s lead on this point. Follow the science, Mathis and the Kansas City Star, rather than hyping a false climate alarm narrative. H.

    "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo chega a 900 gols, e Portugal vence Croácia Aos 39 anos, astro português alcança marca história na carreira na partida de estreia das equipes na Liga das Nações 2024/25 Em um dia histórico para Cristiano Ronaldo, que chegou à marca de 900 gols na carreira, aos 39 anos, Portugal venceu a Croácia por 2 a 1, nesta quinta-feira (5), em partida válida pela primeira rodada da Liga das Nações 2024/25. Diogo Dalot abriu o placar e CR7 completou o triunfo no Estádio da Luz, em Lisboa. Além disso, o lateral português fez um gol contra e diminuiu para os croatas. Todos os gols foram marcados no primeiro tempo. Dessa maneira, Portugal começa a Liga das Nações com o pé direito e segue firme em busca do bicampeonato, nesta que é apenas a quarta edição do torneio. Assim, os portugueses chegaram aos primeiros três pontos no Grupo 1 da competição, que ainda conta com Escócia e Polônia. Por outro lado, a Croácia segue com zero. Na Liga das Nações, os dois primeiros colocados se classificam para as quartas de final da competição, e o último colocado cai para a Liga B. Cristiano Ronaldo conseguiu chegar à marca dos 900 gols em jogos oficiais na carreira. O astro, que aproveitou cruzamento de Nuno Mendes para balançar a rede na reta final da primeira etapa, se emocionou com o gol em Lisboa. CR7 chegou a cogitar recentemente que tentará chegar aos mil. Além disso, Pepe, que se aposentou ao fim da Euro 2024, recebeu uma homenagem no Estádio da Luz. O zagueiro brasileiro, naturalizado português, recebeu uma camisa comemorativa e viu surgir um belo mosaico nas arquibancadas. O jogo Em um primeiro tempo animado no Estádio da Luz, os donos da casa levaram a vantagem de 2 a 1 para o intervalo. Dalot abriu o placar, e Cristiano Ronaldo ampliou ao marcar o 900º da carreira. No entanto, o lateral português também marcou contra e diminuiu para os croatas na reta final da primeira etapa. Na volta do intervalo, os croatas subiram a linha de marcação e incomodaram mais a defesa de Portugal. Contudo, os portugueses conseguiram se postar bem defensivamente e sofreram com as investidas da Croácia. Assim, o ritmo de jogo caiu na segunda etapa e o placar de 2 a 1 prevaleceu até o apito final.

    "text": "Are you on the lookout for some new sick burns to unleash on your friends and enemies? Believe it or not, the Bible is actually a great source of insults. If you're looking to slam someone with something that hasn't been heard in thousands of years, God's Word is the place to turn.\nThe Babylon Bee did the hard work for you and put together the following list of crushing insults drawn straight from the Bible that you should start using today:\n- \"Go on up, you bald head!\": Perfect for the next time you see a follically challenged prophet walking nearby. You might want to bring your bear spray, just in case.\n- \"My little finger is thicker than my father's loins!\": Maybe more of an insult aimed at your dad, but a wicked insult nonetheless. Plus, it makes you sound pretty impressive.\n- \"You brood of vipers!\": Used by Jesus Himself, this one can be used for just about anyone — especially legalistic religious leaders.\n- \"You son of a perverted and rebellious woman!\": This one serves as a double-barreled insult to not only inflict sick burns on your target but his mom as well.\n- \"Circumcize yoself!\": Even if it isn't taken literally (ouch), This is the perfect response to anyone criticizing the legitimacy of your faith.\n- \"Cashmeouside howbowdat?\": This can only be found in The Message version.\n- \"You who are doomed to eat your own dung and drink your own urine!\": Gross.\n- \"You blind fools! You can't even see, AND you're a fool!\": Another good one from Jesus, this one lets someone know they are a total idiot who has no eyesight.\n- \"Perhaps your god is droppin' a deuce?\": Haha! Get REKT, false prophets!\nDon't wait too long, go and start tossing ruthless burns on everyone around — while quoting scripture at the same time!\nNOT SATIRE:\nWatch The Ark and the Darkness\nWitness the evidence for the global flood in the riveting documentary The Ark and the Darkness: Unearthing the Mysteries of Noah's Flood. The 4,000-year-old story of a universal flood is shared across cultures, but many people today take it to be a mere myth.

    "text": "Акио Тойода: электромобили не так экологичны, как кажется\nЭлектромобили могут доминировать в заголовках и политических программах, но дорога к более чистому будущему — это не улица с односторонним движением, говорит глава самого продаваемого в мире бренда и давнего эксперта гибридных технологий Акио Тойода.\nИ пока некоторые автопроизводители стремятся к полной электрификации, Toyota продолжает удерживать свои позиции, удваивая ставку на гибриды, осторожно расширяя при этом свою линейку электромобилей.\nВ адрес Toyota летит много критики за довольно медленное распространение электрокаров. Известный своей твёрдой позицией в отношении многоэнергетической стратегии, Тойода в очередной раз объяснил, почему Toyota не идёт абсолютно электрическим путём.\n«Мы продали около 27 миллионов гибридов, которые оказали такое же влияние, как 9 миллионов электромобилей на дороге. Но если бы мы произвели 9 миллионов электрокаров в Японии, это фактически увеличило бы выбросы углерода, а не сократило бы их», — заявил он.\nГибриды делают Hyundai рекордсменом продаж\nАкио Тойода: настоящая спортивная машина пахнет бензином\nГлава Toyota буквально объяснил, что электромобили не являются панацеей. Очевидно, что машины на аккумуляторах обеспечивают нулевые выбросы выхлопных газов, но это не всё. Воздействие на окружающую среду производства электрокаров и выработки электроэнергии для их зарядки гораздо сложнее, чем кажется. Именно поэтому гибриды ещё многие годы будут очень актуальны, и Тойода это понял в момент создания первого такого автомобиля марки.\nКорни Toyota в разработке гибридов уходят к модели Prius, появившейся в 1997 году. С тех пор гибриды стали основной частью глобальных продаж компании. Сегодня гибридные варианты предлагаются практически в каждой модельной линейке Toyota. Спрос этих машин особенно высок в Европе и Северной Америке, где самозаряжающиеся гибриды часто рассматриваются как практичный, менее затратный шаг к электрификации.\nРаботать на грузовиках в США смогут только англоговорящие водители\nБлэкаут в Европе показал реальную пользу электромобилей\nИ хотя электромобили продолжают захватывать долю рынка, есть значительный сегмент покупателей, которые всё ещё сомневаются в них. По мнению многих экспертов, именно на эту категорию и работает Toyota.\nПодход Тойоды включает в себя не только гибриды, но и подключаемые гибриды, автомобили на водородных топливных элементах, электромобили на аккумуляторах и даже двигатели внутреннего сгорания, работающие на синтетическом топливе. Для Toyota важно сохранить многообразие выбора для покупателя, что все годы и отстаивает глава концерна.\nИ это не новость. В прошлом году Тойода заявил, что даже в долгосрочной перспективе полностью электрические автомобили составят только 30% глобальных продаж, а резкий переход к исключительно электрическому автобудущему ставит под угрозу 5,5 миллиона японских рабочих мест.",
