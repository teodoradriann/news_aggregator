    "title": "Antiviral Reduced Transmission of Influenza to Close Contacts | MedPage Today",
    "text": "Key Takeaways The antiviral baloxavir significantly reduced household transmission of influenza compared with placebo. The drug showed consistent effects across age groups, virus types, and countries, with no new safety concerns. Experts caution that baloxavir resistance and limited data on novel flu strains remain key challenges. A single dose of the antiviral baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) led to a lower incidence of influenza virus transmission to household contacts compared with placebo, a phase IIIb randomized trial showed.\nFive days after receiving the intervention, the adjusted incidence of transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza was 9.5% with baloxavir compared with 13.4% with placebo (adjusted OR 0.68, 95.38% CI 0.50-0.93, P =0.01), resulting in an adjusted relative risk reduction of 29%, reported Arnold Monto, MD, of the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor, and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine .\nThe adjusted incidence of transmission of influenza virus by day 5 that resulted in symptoms was 5.8% with baloxavir and 7.6% with placebo, but this difference was not significant (adjusted OR 0.75, 95.38% CI 0.50-1.12, P =0.16). However, the authors noted that the incidence in the placebo group was lower than their a priori assumptions from sample-size calculations, \"possibly because of COVID-19 pandemic-related behavioral changes leading to fewer cases for evaluation.\"\n\"Most members of the households in this trial were mainly unvaccinated, and how previous vaccination may affect the incidence of transmission after baloxavir treatment remains unclear,\" Monto and team wrote. \"In a pandemic, development of a vaccine would take time, and the availability of an antiviral drug that reduces disease severity and person-to-person transmission could serve as a new element to combat such a pandemic.\"\n\"Although vaccines will remain the primary control measure for influenza epidemics and pandemics, antiviral drugs play a complementary role, particularly in a pandemic scenario, as well as in persons who are not vaccinated seasonally,\" they added.\nMonto and colleagues reported that the difference in transmission incidence favoring baloxavir occurred \"across age groups, seasons, influenza types (A[H1N1pdm09], A[H3N2], and B), times from symptom onset to receipt of baloxavir or placebo, and geographic regions. The matching of influenza subtype and the timing of the trial assessments mitigate the low likelihood of transmission from a nonhousehold source of infection during the follow-up period, which would dilute the treatment effect.\"\nIn an accompanying editorial , Timothy M. Uyeki, MD, MPH, of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and co-authors suggested that it's unclear how baloxavir might perform with novel influenza A viruses.\n\"Data are lacking on the efficacy, effectiveness, appropriate dose administration, or duration of baloxavir use for the treatment or post-exposure prophylaxis of novel influenza A viruses of pandemic potential, including highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, which limits the use of baloxavir in real-world public health strategies,\" they wrote.\n\"During the early phase of an influenza pandemic, when pandemic influenza vaccines are not yet available, early treatment with baloxavir, with its ability to decrease viral shedding, might have greater benefit in reducing transmission than when it is used for seasonal influenza, because most exposed persons will lack specific immunity to the pandemic influenza virus and household transmission is expected to be high,\" they noted.\nThough 7.2% of index patients showed emergence of drug-resistant viruses during follow-up, none of these viruses were detected in household contacts. \"All influenza antiviral drugs exert a selective pressure on viruses, which can result in the emergence of drug-resistant variants,\" Monto and team explained.\nStill, the potential for baloxavir resistance is a concern, the editorialists noted.\n\"Transmission of influenza viruses with reduced baloxavir susceptibility has been uncommon, but transmission of drug-resistant viruses remains a public health concern for all antiviral medications,\" they wrote. \"Thus, ongoing global surveillance for drug-resistant influenza virus is essential to inform antiviral use.\"\nThis study, conducted during the 2019-2024 flu seasons across multiple countries, involved 1,457 index patients ages 5-64 who were randomly assigned to receive baloxavir or placebo in the first 48 hours after symptom onset, as well as 2,681 household contacts.\nBaloxavir was given to 726 index patients, while 731 received placebo. The primary analysis population of index patients included 548 in the baloxavir group (mean age 30.8, 54.7% female) and 544 in the placebo group (mean age 31.8, 51.1% female).\nNo new safety concerns were reported in treated index patients.",

    "text": "Snowstorm expected to start in Hagerstown region late Sunday: What we know\nThe Monday morning and afternoon commutes could get messy as the National Weather Service is forecasting a few inches of snow late Sunday through Monday afternoon in the Hagerstown region, including southern Franklin County, Pa.\nMeteorologists in the Baltimore/Washington and State College, Pa., forecast offices said Thursday morning it was too soon to put a number on how many inches of snow the area could get. However meteorologist Cody Ledbetter with the Baltimore/Washington office said it's likely the Hagerstown area will get at least a few inches of snow.\nLedbetter said the snow is expected to start late Sunday afternoon or evening and could linger into late Monday afternoon or evening.\nStorm tracks can change that far out, but as of Thursday morning the Washington County area was expected to get all snow, with more of a wintry mix farther south.\nHagerstown Public Works Director Eric Deike said Thursday morning he was seeing reports of 1 to 3 inches of snow expected locally.\nAs the storm starts, crews will disperse salt on bridges and roads, Deike said. If the city gets 3 inches of snow, crews will plow the snow and distribute salt on driving surfaces, he said.\nLedbetter and meteorologist Joe Bauco with the State College forecast office said temperatures are expected to remain below freezing during the snowstorm. Ledbetter said it's expected to be \"very cold\" the next two weeks.\nThe snow is expected to stick and there's potential for black ice, Bauco said.\nDeike said even with temperatures below freezing, if the sun comes out Tuesday that should help melt snow off the asphalt.\nEditor's Note: Please send notices about weather-related cancellations and postponements to webupdate@herald-mail.com.",

    "text": "Quiénes son los dos barras de \"La 12\" con los que habló Riquelme para evitar el desastre ante Gimnasia El presidente de Boca fue uno de los grandes protagonistas de la noche y vivió en primera persona las complicaciones en Rosario. Juan Román Riquelme, el presidente de Boca que fue uno de los grandes protagonistas de los incidentes que se vivieron en el duelo ante Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata en los cuartos de final de la Copa Argentina, [contó algunos detalles sobre lo sucedido en Rosario](https://www.minutouno.com/deportes/riquelme-los-incidentes-boca-y-gimnasia-los-barras-me-ayudaron-calmar-la-gente-n6074176) pero también se [llevó todas las miradas de los medios internacionales](https://www.minutouno.com/deportes/riquelme-los-medios-internacionales-asi-reflejaron-su-intervencion-evitar-incidentes-n6074276) por su postura dentro de las tribunas para evitar un fuerte desastre entre los hinchas y la Policía del lugar. Entre gases lacrimógenos y balas de goma, Román se hizo presente en el lugar e intentó, en primera persona, hacer entrar en razón a los hinchas que buscaban la confrontación con sus pares del Lobo. Al alertar la presencia del ídolo Xeneize, muchos cambiaron su postura y comenzaron a darle una mano para intentar calmar la tensa situación y permitir que el encuentro, que estaba por comenzar el segundo tiempo, se reanudara con \"normalidad\". Los dos barras con los que habló Riquelme en \"La 12\" para evitar el desastre ante Gimnasia Según contó el periodista Gustavo Grabia de TyC Sports, las dos personas con quienes se ve dialogando a Riquelme para que entren en razón son las manos derecha de Rafael Di Zeo y Marcelo Aravena, dos de las tres patas de poder donde se asienta la barra. El primero se llama Fabián Kruger, le dicen Topadora, y estuvo preso junto a Di Zeo por acciones de la barra 15 años atrás. El otro que quedó patente en las imágenes es Fernando Gatica, alias Lana, histórico de la facción Lomas de Zamora también con prontuario importante y nombre fuerte en el mundo de los violentos. Además, Grabia reveló que, salvo que desde el Xeneize sean incluidos en el derecho de admisión, estarán sin problemas en La Bombonera en el duelo en el que Boca se deberá enfrentar a Deportivo Riestra en lo que será el primer partido de Fernando Gago cómo local y antes una multitud de hinchas.
