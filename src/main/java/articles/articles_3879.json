    "text": "Photo: GMVozd/E+/Getty Images\nChain restaurants and popular eateries are great, but there's something about sitting down at a locally famous hole-in-the-wall or a longtime favorite mom and pop shop that has been serving up tried and true delicious meals for years that just hits home.\nUsing reviews, awards and accolades as well as first-hand experience, LoveFood compiled a list of the \"best mom and pop restaurant\" in every state, eateries that have been a mainstay of the community for decades or establishments that serve up family recipes that have been perfected over several generations.\nAccording to the site, the best mom and pop restaurant in all of South Carolina is Sweatman's Bar-B-Que, an eatery in Holly Hill that serves some of the best BBQ around. Sweatman's , located at 1427 Eutaw Road, has a 4.5 star rating on Google and nearly 1,000 reviews.\nHere's what the site had to say about this restaurant offering \"incredible comfort food\":\n\"Barbecue is a way of life in South Carolina, but there's something really special about this sweet spot in Holly Hill, which has been serving hungry diners since 1959.

    "text": "A Rocherlea man grabbed two firearms from his car as he tried to run from police after an evade police incident, the Launceston Magistrates Court heard.\nDamien Michael Milburn, 34, pleaded guilty to a raft of driving, firearms and family violence charges committed early this year.\nPolice prosecutor Dee Wadley said that on March 30, 2025, Milburn was driving a black Holden Commodore on Lilydale Rd.\nThe vehicle's number plate did not match that of a black car, but a Ford Territory, so they attempted to intercept it.\n\"The defendant refused to pull over and increased his speed,\" she said.\nHe stopped at an address in King Billy Crescent and jumped a fence. She said he had two firearms.\n\"As he was running away, he dropped a firearm, and he threw one into 7 King Billy Crescent,\" she said.\nPolice caught him, but he resisted arrest, later telling police he did not want to be arrested.\nA search located 38 grams of methamphetamine, two snaplock bags of methylamphetamine powder and crystal (ice), a snaplock bag of suboxone and a Gerber knife.\n\"The firearms thrown into 7 King Billy Crescent had a round in the chamber,\" she said.\nMilburn told police he had painted the car black.\nThe court heard that a ballistics report would show whether the firearms were in working order.\nMilburn was a disqualified driver and the subject of a firearms prohibition order at the time.\nOn January 31, police intercepted him when he had 27 grams of cannabis bud in his possession.\nMs Wadley told magistrate Sharon Cure that Milburn had breached a five month suspended jail term with the offences.\nThe court heard that Milburn had been given the benefit of drug treatment orders in 2013 and 2017, which allowed him to avoid jail.\nDefence lawyer Mark Doyle said Milburn had previously had a defeatist attitude to the orders and believed he could not extract himself from the drug lifestyle because everyone knew he was involved in drugs.\nHe said there were signs Milburn was ready to change.\nMs Cure said he had spent an awful lot of time in custody.\n\"It's just a sad waste of a life, at 34 years of age, he has just been in and out of jail,\" she said.\nMs Cure said that Milburn would probably have to serve the five-month suspended sentence and ordered that he be assessed for a drug treatment order.\nHe was remanded in custody to reappear for sentence on May 1, at 2.15 pm.\nMs Cure said he was a \"walk-up start\" to be declared a serial family violence offender.",

    "text": "A minimum of 31 employees have been rescued safely after a tunnel collapse in Wilmington, a Los Angeles suburb, on Wednesday night. The accident reportedly took place at approximately 8 p.m. when work was underway on the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel project, NBC Los Angeles has reported.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) has indicated that the laborers were retrieved from the underground in batches of eight through the use of a crane based at the site of construction. To date, there have been no reported injuries.\nThe City of Los Angeles has mobilized resources to the tunnel collapse in Wilmington,” Mayor Karen Bass posted on X. “Over 100 LAFD responders have been dispatched, including Urban Search and Rescue teams. Thank you to all of those who are taking action immediately to respond to this emergency.”\nLAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for.\nI just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.’s true heroes.\n[pic.twitter.com/6hdAwbH1MI]— Mayor Karen Bass (@MayorOfLA)\n[July 10, 2025]\nMassive Emergency Response Underway After Tunnel Collapse\nThe tunnel collapse occurred at the $630.5 million Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel project. The project is a wastewater management undertaking commissioned by the Los Angeles County Sanitation District. Flatiron Dragados, the project’s prime contractor, says the tunnel is roughly seven miles long and 18 feet in diameter. It is situated approximately 450 feet below ground level.\n31 construction workers rescued about an hour after a tunnel collapse caused by structural failure in Los Angeles\n[pic.twitter.com/PnsVOBfnju]— TRT World Now (@TRTWorldNow)\n[July 10, 2025]\nEarly reports suggested that 15 workers were trapped after the collapse. LAFD officials later confirmed 31 workers had been rescued with no injuries reported. Meanwhile, footage from the scene revealed a full-scale emergency response operation, with cranes and confined space rescue units actively working on site.\n“Up to 15 tunnel workers have been reported originally isolated by a ‘collapse’ in an (undetermined depth or diameter) industrial tunnel as many as six miles south of the response address, the only tunnel access,” LAFD stated in a formal release. “No injuries have been confirmed.”\nThe building collapsed at the corner of W. Lomita Boulevard and S. Figueroa Street in Wilmington. In response, LAFD dispatched over 100 personnel to the incident site. The team included Urban Search and Rescue units with specialized training for confined space tunnel rescues.\nProject Timeline and Investigation\nAccording to reports by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Department in July 2024, tunneling was initially expected to be completed this year. Nevertheless, the entire project is set to complete in 2027. The reason behind the collapse is still under investigation and has not yet been determined. Details about the tunnel’s condition have not been reported.",

    "title": "Mozambique's Gas Revolution: Emeritus International Leads the Charge in Cabo Delgado",
    "text": "In the heart of Southern Africa, a transformative energy movement is underway, with Mozambique's burgeoning gas projects at its core. Emeritus International, a key player in this energy revolution, is setting its sights on the gas-rich Cabo Delgado province, aiming to secure a foothold in what is considered the continent's most significant gas ventures this decade. As the world's eyes turn to Mozambique, the nation's gas fields, notably the Pande-Temane Complex and the Mozambique Secunda Pipeline operated by Rompco, become crucial arteries pumping vitality into the region's economy and beyond.\nThe Pulse of Economic Growth: Mozambique's Gas Projects\nMozambique, with its vast reserves of natural gas, is on a fast track to becoming a global energy giant. The country's Pande-Temane Complex and the pivotal Mozambique Secunda Pipeline, which boasts a capacity of about 212 petajoules a year, are not just infrastructural feats but lifelines to economic resurgence and social development across Southern Africa. Operated by Rompco, the pipeline is a testament to regional collaboration, efficiently connecting gas fields to hungry markets in South Africa, and facilitating a crucial transition from coal to cleaner energy sources.\nEmeritus International: A Conduit for Stability and Growth\nAmid this backdrop of potential and ambition, Emeritus International emerges as a strategic investor, keen on leveraging the explosive growth of Mozambique's gas sector. By zeroing in on the Cabo Delgado province, the company is not merely investing in gas; it is betting on Africa's future. Emeritus's approach is multifaceted, combining the provision of security for these national assets with a savvy investment strategy that harnesses competitive capital. This not only bolsters its financial stability and credit rating but also aligns with stringent regulatory frameworks. The outcome? A ripple effect of benefits including increased business retention, a stimulated local economy, and a fortified market position.\nChallenges and Opportunities Ahead\nHowever, the road to energy dominance is fraught with challenges. Industry officials and companies, including those involved in the awarding of a long-term concession for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique, have voiced concerns over timelines and potential gas shortages. With plans for new gas-to-power projects on the horizon and the necessity to secure gas supply by 2026, the stakes couldn't be higher. Emeritus International, recognizing these hurdles, is not deterred. Instead, it sees an unparalleled opportunity to diversify income sources across African markets, creating a stable financial bedrock upon which the future of Southern Africa's energy landscape can be built.\nIn conclusion, as Mozambique continues to solidify its status as a powerhouse in the global gas sector, the role of companies like Emeritus International cannot be overstated. Through strategic investment, a commitment to regional development, and an eye on long-term sustainability, Emeritus is not just participating in Mozambique's energy narrative—it's helping to write it. With the Pande-Temane Complex and the Mozambique Secunda Pipeline as vital components of this story, the promise of economic renewal and energy security for Southern Africa shines brightly on the horizon, heralding a new era of prosperity.",

    "title": "Brighton golea y acaba con la racha positiva del Tottenham en la Premier League – Periódico Zócalo | Noticias de Saltillo, Torreón, Piedras Negras, Monclova, Acuña",
    "text": "Londres.- Cuando parecía recompuesto, con tres victorias consecutivas, el Tottenham se tambaleó, completó un primer tiempo decepcionante y recayó con una derrota concluyente frente al Brighton ; un batacazo con un 2-0 en 22 minutos y un golazo posterior del ecuatoriano Pervís Estupiñán que limitó su posterior reacción (4-2).\nEl Tottenham no está preparado para competir por la Premier. Habrá que ver si por la clasificación para la Champions. Su irregularidad es una rémora, como visibilizó de nuevo en el estadio Amex.\nNo hay matices. Su puesta en escena fue un desastre . Dos goles a toda velocidad no admiten ninguna disculpa en un equipo que pretende ser una alternativa a lo máximo en la nueva era iniciada sin Harry Kane. El inicio lo apuntó a las cotas más ambiciosas. El presente lo ha rebajado. Está a seis puntos del liderato . Fue mucho peor la sensación en el terreno.\nEl 1-0 fue de Hinshelwood . Minuto 12. El lateral de 18 años del Brighton, internacional inglés en las categorías inferiores, apenas doce encuentros en el conjunto profesional de su actual club, sumó su segundo tanto de la campaña con un control y un derechazo dentro del área que sobrepasó a Vicario , salvador formidable un rato antes ante Danny Welbeck.\nEl 2-0 fue de Joao Pedro . De penalti. Minuto 22. Lo cometió Kulusevksi cuando el propio Welbeck se disponía a cazar un balón en el área tras un barullo. Es una pena máxima inadmisible en tiempos de VAR. Su agarrón, el nítido y excesivo tirón de la camiseta sobre el atacante rival, fue tan evidente que la mera revisión del video no admitía ninguna duda.\nY gracias para el Tottenham , que respiró cuando el poste repelió el lanzamiento de James Milner desde el borde del área, en el minuto 31, o cuando el árbitro decretó inválido el 3-0 por la posición en fuera de juego de Buonanotte. Era tan solo el minuto 37.\nUna señal de supervivencia del Tottenham. La mejor noticia era una desventaja aún solo de dos goles, por más que fuera ya amplia. Y un segundo tiempo para resarcirse.\nYa en la segunda mitad era otro Tottenham , más cerca de su versión, más próximo a su nivel, más competitivo , más ofensivo, más desbordante… Superior entonces al Brighton. Cuando ya celebraba Richarlison el 2-1, la bandera arriba del asistente lo desconsoló. Otra vez estaba en fuera de juego, como en dos de sus cuatro oportunidades anteriores, del que se fue reemplazado tras el 3-0, que llegó de forma inesperada instantes después.\nDe pronto, Pervis Estupiñán soltó un trallazo . Un zurdazo maravilloso con el que se inventó el 3-0, pero también sofocó ya definitivamente cualquier reacción del Tottenham, aún a media hora del final. Vicario voló a por el balón. No le alcanzó. El lateral ecuatoriano, de vuelta un mes después, alojó la pelota en la escuadra. La confirmación del Brighton. Mucho Día de los Inocentes, pero este golazo no es de broma. 😱👀\nEstupiñán le clava el tercero al Tottenham con esta obra de arte. 🥵 #LaPremierEnParamount 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘪𝘥𝘰 𝘦𝘹𝘤𝘭𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘷𝘰 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘢 🇲🇽, 🇬🇹, 🇵🇦, 🇭🇳, 🇨🇷, 🇳🇮 y 🇸🇻 pic.twitter.com/P8ZOxMNPme\n— Paramount+ México (@ParamountPlusMX) December 28, 2023\nEl penalti cometido por Lo Celso, en el campo desde el 3-0, en sustitución de Richarlison, fue el enésimo despropósito del Tottenham, que recibió el 4-0 de Joao Pedro . Un batacazo, aligerado por el 4-1 de Alejo Véliz en el 81, el 4-2 de Ben Davies en el 85 y una ofensiva final, con un tiro al poste de Hojbjerg, que puso aún más en evidencia su primer tiempo . Aún se sostiene en plazas europeas el club londinense .",

    "title": "Beware! OKX Exchange Issues Warning Over Harmful Firefox Extension",
    "text": "Seychelles-based OKX has issued a warning about the proliferation of unauthorized OKX wallet add-ons, which are currently available in the Firefox plug-in store. According to user reports, the fake browser extension adds a third-party functionality within the site’s browser interface.\nAlthough Firefox’s plug-in store has recorded less than 100 downloads as of this writing, the crypto exchange immediately issued a statement warning users that it had not released any Firefox browser extensions.\nOKX management immediately responded to the reports of fake extensions and used its official Twitter/X page to warn and advise its users. In a post shared on January 8th, OKX stated that the company has not formally released an official browser extension for its wallet and asked those who mistakenly downloaded the extension to secure and move their digital assets immediately.\n【重要公告】我们注意到近期 Firefox 浏览器插件商城中出现了假冒的 OKX Wallet 插件，请注意：OKX 官方目前尚未发布任何 Firefox 插件\n如果您已经使用该恶意插件请立即转移相关钱包资产，我们已经就此向 Firefox 官方投诉。… pic.twitter.com/GjImvSA35l\n— OKX中文 (@okxchinese) January 8, 2025\nOKX added that that they have already submitted a complaint to Firefox. The team further suggested that users download any plug-ins on its official website and asked its followers to report any suspected fake products or tools.\nFake browser extensions are a growing problem online and have a huge impact on the financial community. Malicious browser extensions, like the fake OKX wallet add-ons, may allow unauthorized access to financial information, account credentials, and other data.\nReports have shown that bad actors also use these fake browser extensions for phishing activities that aim to trick users into sharing their login information.\nOver $1 Billion Lost To Phishing Scams In 2024According to Certik, hackers used phishing to steal cryptocurrencies from unsuspecting victims in 2024. In its Hack3d: The Web3 Security Report 2024, the security firm shared a list of costly and notorious crypto scams and threats. According to the firm, the industry lost over $1 billion, representing 296 phishing scams, an increase of 21% from 2023’s data.\nMcAfee, another security firm, discovered malware in September 2024 that affected Android mobile phones. The malware called SpyAgent appears to be a legitimate Android app, but it was a scam that affected nearly 300 fake apps. This malware uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scan images and steal personal information, including crypto passcodes.\nLast September 19th, 2024, Decentraland lost access to its social media page. After controlling Decentraland’s Twitter/X account, hackers used it to promote phishing activities, luring unsuspecting users to click on fake links. Users who click on these fake links have lost some or most of their digital assets due to malware.\nFor OKX, there have been no reports on how many users were affected or if these fake browser extensions have compromised their digital assets.\nFeatured image from SCMP, chart from TradingView",
