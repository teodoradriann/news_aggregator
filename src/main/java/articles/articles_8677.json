    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues.\nAccording to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.”\n“Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.”\nThe 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman.\nPeople are also reading…\nGregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He\ndied in 2017 at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications.\nThe petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.”\n“Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states.\n“I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,”\nCher told People magazine in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse.\n“I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.”\nCher is also the mother of Chaz Bono.\nA hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation.\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

    "text": "[vc_row gap=”20″][vc_column width=”3/4″][vc_column_text](KNSI) – A community activist and head of a nonprofit in St. Cloud has been charged with helping an accused drug dealer sell a gun.\nLenora Hunt, the head of Too Much Talent, is accused of helping Devounteno Lavance Tyson sell a handgun to a confidential informant working with the Central Minnesota Violent Offender Task Force.\nAccording to the criminal complaint, on July 30th, the informant contacted Tyson, who agreed to sell a gun. The task force had been investigating Tyson for nearly a year related to fentanyl sales in the St. Cloud area. Investigators were monitoring his phone number to identify co-conspirators and collect evidence related to his alleged drug dealing.\nThe VOTF says they covertly recorded Tyson before a meeting with Hunt. The criminal complaint alleges Tyson discussed Hunt running for mayor and being able to help him and several co-defendants with criminal cases once she wins. They also talked about a gun in her possession, the amount of money she wants for it, the large amounts of grant funding she is getting, and other details regarding Hunt’s daily life. Tyson also vaguely discussed bonding out of jail and Hunt having a lawyer ready to go. Police say at no time did she make any attempt to comply with Minnesota statutes regulating firearm sales.\nAccording to investigators, Tyson went to Too Much Talent, located at 1415 5th Street North in St. Cloud, which they knew was operated by Hunt. After Tyson went inside for a short period and returned with a .9mm handgun.\nHunt is charged with one gross misdemeanor count of transferring a pistol/assault weapon illegally.\nAfter learning of the allegations on Wednesday, Mayor Dave Kleis told KNSI News he asked Hunt to resign from the St. Cloud Planning Commission pending all legal matters. Her resignation was effective immediately.\nTyson’s case is still making its way through the courts.\nRecords show that during the fentanyl investigation, numerous co-conspirators frequented Too Much Talent, and several of those people have been charged with selling fentanyl.\n___\nCopyright 2024 Leighton Media.

    "text": "How I Automated My Entire Morning Routine with Julia Programming\nImagine waking up to a fully automated morning. Your coffee is brewing, your favorite news articles are ready for reading, and your to-do list is neatly organized before you’ve even brushed your teeth. Sounds like magic, right? Well, I made this happen using Julia, a powerful programming language that excels at fast data manipulation and automating tedious tasks. Let me share with you how I automated my entire morning routine — and show you some Julia code along the way!\nStep 1: Scheduling the Coffee Machine\nThe first step was to automate my coffee. I bought a smart coffee maker that has WiFi capabilities and could be integrated with a custom script via API. To make it work, I used Julia’s\nHTTP.jl\nto send commands to the coffee machine.Here’s how I did it:\nusing HTTP\nfunction start_coffee()\n# Replace with the correct URL of your coffee maker's API\ncoffee_machine_url = \"http://192.168.1.100/start\"\nresponse = HTTP.post(coffee_machine_url, [])\nif response.status == 200\nprintln(\"Coffee is brewing!\")\nelse\nprintln(\"Failed to start the coffee maker.\")\nend\nend\n# Start brewing coffee at 7 AM every day\n@async sleep(60*60*7 - time()) start_coffee()\nThis script sends a POST request to my coffee machine at exactly 7 AM every morning to start brewing. The\n@async\nmacro ensures that the script doesn’t block other tasks while it waits.Step 2: Setting Up My Morning Playlist\nI like to start my morning with some upbeat music. I used Spotify’s API along with Julia’s\nSpotify.jl\nwrapper to automatically start my \"Morning Routine\" playlist.Here’s the code snippet that made it possible:\nusing Spotify\nfunction play_morning_playlist()\n# Authentication tokens for Spotify\naccess_token = \"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\nplaylist_id = \"37i9dQZF1DX4fpCWaHOned\" # Replace with your playlist\ndevice_id = \"YOUR_DEVICE_ID\"\n# Set the playlist to play\nSpotify.play(access_token, device_id, playlist_id)\nprintln(\"Your morning playlist is now playing!\")\nend\n# Play the playlist at 7:15 AM\n@async sleep(60*60*7 + 15*60 - time()) play_morning_playlist()\nThis code interacts with Spotify’s API to start my favorite morning playlist on a connected device (like my smart speaker). I use\n@async\nagain to manage timing without blocking other tasks.Step 3: Reading the News\nAfter coffee and music, I like to read the news. I automated fetching the top headlines using\nHTTP.jl\nand JSON.jl\nto get data from an open news API and then print it out in a concise way.Here’s how I did it:\nusing HTTP, JSON\nfunction fetch_top_news()\nnews_url = \"https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY\"\nresponse = HTTP.get(news_url)\ndata = JSON.parse(String(response.body))\nfor article in data[\"articles\"][1:5]\nprintln(article[\"title\"])\nend\nend\n# Fetch and print news headlines at 7:30 AM\n@async sleep(60*60*7 + 30*60 - time()) fetch_top_news()\nThis script fetches the top five news headlines and prints them to my terminal at 7:30 AM. With the power of Julia, this task takes less than a few seconds, providing me with a quick glance at the world before I start my day.\nStep 4: Generating My To-Do List\nLast but not least, I automated my to-do list. Every morning at 7:45 AM, Julia scripts gather tasks from Trello and emails them to me using SMTP.\nusing SMTPClient, JSON, HTTP\nfunction send_daily_todo()\n# Fetch tasks from Trello API\ntrello_url = \"https://api.trello.com/1/boards/YOUR_BOARD_ID/cards?key=YOUR_API_KEY&token=YOUR_TOKEN\"\nresponse = HTTP.get(trello_url)\ndata = JSON.parse(String(response.body))\ntasks = [card[\"name\"] for card in data]\n# Generate to-do list content\nemail_content = join(tasks, \"\\n\")\n# Send the email with to-do list\nclient = SMTPClient(\"smtp.gmail.com\"; port=587, username=\"your_email@gmail.com\", password=\"your_password\")\nSMTPClient.send(client, \"your_email@gmail.com\", \"my_email@gmail.com\", \"Today's To-Do List\", email_content)\nprintln(\"Your to-do list has been emailed to you!\")\nend\n# Send the daily to-do list email at 7:45 AM\n@async sleep(60*60*7 + 45*60 - time()) send_daily_todo()\nUsing\nSMTPClient.jl\n, I sent my daily tasks directly to my inbox—no need to go to Trello. I simply see what needs to be done while sipping my coffee.Wrapping It All Up\nJulia made it possible for me to automate my morning routine with just a few scripts. Now, every day I wake up to freshly brewed coffee, uplifting music, curated news, and a pre-organized to-do list, all without lifting a finger.\nThe beauty of using Julia for this was not just the efficiency of its performance, but also how fun and approachable it was to write these simple yet powerful automation scripts. If you’re looking for a lightweight yet powerful solution to make your life easier, Julia is worth considering.\nWhat’s Next?\nNow that my mornings are running on autopilot, I’m looking to expand automation to other parts of my day — perhaps monitoring my health metrics or planning dinner based on what’s in the fridge. With Julia, the possibilities are endless.\nIf you’ve got any ideas or want to share how you’re automating parts of your life, feel free to leave a comment below! Let’s make mornings enjoyable again — one line of code at a time.",

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nEdición\nÁngel Mendoza\nDomingo, 10 de marzo 2024, 13:26\nNecesitas ser suscriptor para acceder a esta funcionalidad.\nCompartir\nRodri seguirá siendo azulillo hasta junio de 2025, pase lo que pase cuando acabe la temporada. El mediocentro iliturgitano ha disputado un total de 307 partidos defendiendo el escudo y ha visto la portería hasta en siete ocasiones. Jugó dos fases de ascenso a Segunda División y 13 partidos de Copa del Rey, estando presente como capitán en momentos históricos de la entidad.\nEl presidente, Luis Vera, manifestó en el acto oficial que «Rodri tiene los valores que debe tener un capitán, los transmite a sus compañeros con serenidad, saber estar en el campo y liderazgo, transmitiendo las directrices del míster. Ha demostrado mucho y creo que nos quedan muchos domingos de gloria con este equipo».\nPara Miguel de Hita, esta noticia es un aviso a navegantes porque «sienta las bases del futuro más inmediato en un momento delicado, cuando no sabemos en qué categoría vamos a estar el año que viene. Su renovación es un paso que dice mucho de cara a los demás, le agradezco que quiera continuar, esta es su casa».\nRodri comentó que es un día especial, que tiene la misma ilusión que el primer día que pisó Linarejos y que «estemos donde estemos el año que viene, yo voy a estar aquí dándolo todo. Estoy comprometido, me encuentro muy bien, yo eso lo veo y el día que me fallen las piernas no estaré por estar. Tengo confianza en sacar la temporada y estar en Primera Federación el año que viene».\nDe esta forma, Rodri cumplirá una décima temporada vistiendo la camiseta azulilla y puede que no sea la última. Ya es una leyenda viva y estaría a una temporada más de igualar las 11 campañas de Chico, el gran capitán, en el Linares.\n«Linares te da algo especial. No es solo Chico o los que llevamos muchos años, hay gente que pasa aquí uno o dos años y siempre tienen Linares presentes. Me han escrito muchos compañeros que se acuerdan de mí, de club, este club y su afición es fuerte. No sé explicarlo con palabras», dijo el centrocampista.\nAunque varios clubes llevan varias temporadas llamando a su puerta, «desde hace muchos años, en mi cabeza siempre está Linares. Estoy cómodo en mi casa, aquí me sentí siempre querido y crecí en todos los aspectos. Me siento muy orgulloso de representar este escudo como capitán. Este club tiene mucho en común conmigo, vengo de una familia humilde y me llena mucho saber que estoy en un club humilde que lucha contra los grandes».\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\n<a href=\"https://www.elnortedecastilla.es/avila/madre-mujer-fugada-psiquiatrico-avila-dejan-traerla-20240307183932-nt.html#vca=voc-recirc&vso=ideal\">\nLa madre de la mujer fugada de un psiquiátrico en Ávila: «No me dejan traerla»\n</a>\nEl Norte de Castilla\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\n<a href=\"https://www.ideal.es/culturas/gastronomia/listado-restaurantes-estrella-michelin-provincias-20231128222445-ntrc.html\">\nEl mapa de los restaurantes con estrella Michelin por provincias\n</a>\nSara I.

    "text": "By Lootpress Staff ,\n4 hours ago PRINCETON, WV (LOOTPRESS) – A man faces charges after stealing hundreds of dollars in merchandise from the Ace Hardware in Mercer County.\nAccording to documents from the Magistrate Court of Mercer County , on Monday, February 19, 2024, at approximately 9:04am, the 1055 Stafford Drive Ace Hardware location in Princeton, WV experienced a loss of merchandise totaling at $1,492.62.\nThe merchandise taken included a bundle of copper wire valued at $718, a power stack 20-volt battery valued at $178.99, a LI ion 20-volt battery valued at $129, an additional bundle of copper wire valued at $169 and an XR-LI 20-volt battery valued at $198.99.\nJeffrey Dean Bailey could be seen on camera, with the items having reportedly been concealed by Dean stuffing them into his overalls.\nBailey was seen leaving the scene in a silver 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander with Virginia registration. He then reportedly conspired with others, taking 25 pounds of stolen copper to Brushfork Recycle the day after the incident and selling it for market value through an individual at the business.\nVideo from Brushfork Recycle surveillance depicts Bailey at the location still wearing the overalls and hat worn during the theft incident.\nAuthorities were unsuccessful in locating Bailey until March 18, 2024, at which point he was arrested on charges of Grand Larceny and Conspiracy to Commit a Felony based on the incident during which the merchandise was stolen.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "The Bible Is Yet Again on Trial in Finland",
    "text": "E very American should know about the “Bible trial,” the perilous case of Päivi Räsänen in Finland, which is shaping up to be one of the most important tests of religious liberty and freedom of speech in the history of the West.\nRäsänen, a long-serving member of the Finnish parliament who is also a medical doctor, pastor’s wife, and grandmother, is preparing to head to Finland’s Supreme Court in what is truly a modern-day witch trial.\nIn 2019, Räsänen’s church decided to sponsor a “pride” parade. She responded by posting some Bible verses on Twitter and asking how that decision aligned with Scripture. You might expect that to have led to some debate or perhaps even tension, possibly a meeting with church leaders. Instead, she faced criminal prosecution eerily reminiscent of the Soviet Union.\nGovernment officials ransacked Räsänen’s private life, rummaged through 20 years of public statements, and interrogated her on her personal theology. In the process, they dug up a 2004 church pamphlet she had authored on marriage and sexuality, as well as comments she made on a 2019 radio show. Government prosecutors charged Räsänen with three counts of “agitation against a minority group” under the war-crimes statute of Finnish law. A Lutheran bishop, Juhana Pohjola, was charged alongside her for publishing the pamphlet.\nIn early 2022, Räsänen and Pohjola were put on trial. If convicted, they faced potential fines and even years in prison. Finnish state prosecutors proceeded to put the Bible on trial, attacking verses they disagreed with and grilling the defendants about their theological beliefs.\nRäsänen and the bishop were unanimously acquitted on all counts, with the court declaring the seemingly obvious: “It is not for the district court to interpret Biblical concepts.” The prosecution appealed the not-guilty verdict, as is permitted under Finnish law, but lost again at the Court of Appeal.\nYet the prosecution would not accept defeat and filed another appeal with Finland’s Supreme Court, the country’s highest court. Last month, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the prosecution’s appeal, teeing up a decisive ruling that will determine whether the freedoms of speech and religion are protected in Finland today.\nRäsänen’s case is not just about one Finnish politician. It is about the right of all citizens to speak their convictions, to debate freely, and to seek the truth. As history demonstrates, tyrants harness the state to crush dissenting viewpoints.\nThe Finnish case is far from an isolated incident. In England, peaceful citizens have been arrested for silently praying outside abortion facilities. Scotland has just adopted a new “hate speech” law that chills expression, and Ireland is debating its own that would allow the state to criminally charge people for simply possessing material it deems “hateful.”\nIn Mexico, congressman Gabriel Quadri was found guilty of “gender-based political violence” following several posts on Twitter/X. He had expressed concern that seats reserved for women in Mexico’s congress were taken by men identifying as women, in addition to statements on biological reality and fairness in women’s sports.\nAnd just weeks ago, in Belgium, the mayor of Brussels sent police to shut down a conservative conference explicitly because of the views of those speaking and attending. It was reinstated with an emergency court order following the work of ADF International.\nAmerica, with its revolutionary commitment to unalienable rights and fundamental freedoms, has a sacred duty to lead the world in preserving them. Yet even here, we see increasing attempts to censor Americans and erode their freedom of association.\nIn European and other democracies, we have seen examples of the policing of speech gone awry. Sloppy censorship can have disastrous consequences for free societies. As the United States grapples with a range of volatile problems, governments at every level must be mindful of the Constitution and its foundational principles of free expression and freedom of association.\nThe outcome of Finland’s Bible trial will set a key precedent for those who wish to speak and live out their beliefs, with ramifications beyond Christians trying to live out their faith. This is why Alliance Defending Freedom International is coordinating Räsänen’s ongoing legal defense against state prosecution for “hate speech” and Advancing American Freedom is partnering with the organization to ensure that everyone knows her story.\nEven those who disagree with Räsänen’s views have every reason to stand with her. Their freedom is bound up with hers.\nAs Räsänen herself said , “If free speech is not for everybody, then it’s for nobody.”\nSean Nelson is an international-human-rights lawyer serving as legal counsel for global religious freedom at ADF International. Paul Teller is the executive director of Advancing American Freedom.",

    "text": "La selección femenina, ganadora de la Liga de Naciones seis meses después de conseguir vencer en la Copa del Mundo, se dio un baño de masas al ser recibida por miles de aficionados a grito de 'campeonas', este jueves en el Palacio de Vistalegre en Madrid con la mirada puesta en los Juegos Olímpicos de París, siguiente objetivo del combinado español. \"Es un placer estar aquí con todos vosotros con este título que han conseguido estas grandísimas jugadoras. Hoy es un día para sentirnos felices y agradecidas. Ahora a disfrutarlo y vamos a por los Juegos Olímpicos\", declaró la seleccionadora Montse Tomé que quiso agradecer el gran papel que desempeña su cuerpo técnico y el 'staff', y sobre todo, a las jugadoras. \"Agradecer personalmente a mi cuerpo técnico porque estoy rodada de ocho personas que sin ellos no sería posible todo el trabajo para conseguir que las futbolistas saquen su máximo rendimiento. También, a todo el staff que trabajan con cariño, profesionalidad y detalle para que todo tenga el orden ideal y a todas estas futbolistas porque ellas son las verdaderas protagonistas de este juego\", afirmó Tomé ante una grada entregada con banderas y camisetas de la selección, que escuchó como Irene Paredes les animaba a seguir apoyando al equipo. \"Es importante sentir vuestro apoyo y por nuestra parte decir que vamos a por más a si que os necesitamos para eso también\", comentó la jugadora del Barcelona . La selección se proclamó campeona de la primera edición de la Liga de las Naciones tras vencer por 2-0 a Francia, en la Cartuja ante 32.6576 espectadores, gracias a los goles de Aitana Bonmatí en la primera parte y de Mariona Caldentey en el minuto 53 que permitió al combinado nacional alzarse con el trofeo. Previamente, tras ganar en semifinales a Países Bajos por 3-0, ya habían logrado certificar el objetivo de la clasificación a los Juegos Olímpicos. Como homenaje a las madres, cada jugadora fue nombrada por su nombre y sus dos apellidos mientras la afición vitoreaba a cada una de ellas llegando al punto álgido cuando Jennifer Hermoso, con el trofeo en mano, entro al escenario con los aplausos y ánimos de la grada que se cayó a bajo a grito de 'Jenni, Jenni'. Otra de las más aclamadas fue Aitana Bonmatí, MVP de la Final a Cuatro. La fiesta, que comenzó a las 17.00 horas con entrada libre hasta que se completó el aforo y contó con música en directo de grandes artistas invitados como Marlena, en dos ocasiones, Michenlo, Delaporte y Elena Farga, tuvo su punto álgido cuando entraron las jugadoras y el cuerpo técnico alrededor de las 19.00 horas y se cerró con el 'We are the Champions' como es habitual en este tipo de acontecimientos. En la mañana de este jueves, la selección fue recibida por la presidenta del Congreso, junto a los portavoces de los grupos, en el Salón de los Pasos Perdidos, desde el que se trasladaron al hemiciclo, donde ocuparon los escaños y se fotografiaron con los diputados presentes. Posteriormente, el combinado nacional tuvo el reconocimiento en el Palacio de la Moncloa del presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, que recibió una camiseta con los nombres de todas las protagonistas del duelo contra Francia y las ánimo a conseguir una medalla en los Juegos Olímpicos de París que se celebran en los meses de julio y agosto y serán los primeros juegos de su historia.
