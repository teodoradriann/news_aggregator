    "title": "iPhone 17 Pro tipped for a major RAM upgrade - here's what it means",
    "text": "Summary\n- Apple may upgrade the iPhone 17 Pro to 12GB of RAM to enhance its AI capabilities.\n- There is a concern that future Apple Intelligence features could become device exclusive if they require more RAM.\n- Boosting the RAM in the iPhone 17 Pro would not only enhance its AI capabilities but also improve its gaming performance and multitasking abilities.\nThanks to the efficiencies of iOS and its hardware, Apple has never placed much emphasis on the amount of RAM in its devices, unlike Android manufacturers. However, thanks to Apple Intelligence, that is changing.\nA report by 9to5Mac indicates that Apple plans to boost the iPhone 17 Pro's RAM to 12GB to improve its AI capabilities. This speculation began last August when analyst Ming-Chio Ku first suggested it was happening, and recently, analyst Jeff Pu of GFHK Tech Research has corroborated this claim.\nFor reference, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have 8GB of RAM, while the recently launched Galaxy S25 series and OnePlus 13 have 12GB of RAM.\nRelated\n Apple's iPhone 17 is taking shape, and it looks a lot like a Google Pixel\nWe're still a few months away from the formal unveiling of Apple's iPhone 17 series, but the rumor mill is already churning - here's what we know.\nWhat does this mean for the future?\nMore RAM-hungry Apple Intelligence features could become device exclusive\nApple Intelligence requires a minimum of 8GB of RAM to run on an iPhone, a necessity reflected in Apple's recent hardware releases. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max both come with 8GB of RAM and support Apple Intelligence, whereas the standard iPhone 15 models feature 6GB and do not support it. The entire iPhone 16 lineup includes 8GB of RAM, and the new iPhone 16e, now the most affordable iPhone, also supports Apple Intelligence and includes 8GB of RAM.\nIf the iPhone 17 Pro gets 12GB of RAM, it will undoubtedly be more future-proof. However, this raises the question: if future Apple Intelligence features demand more RAM, will they become device-exclusive? Hopefully, this won't become the case, as Apple will certainly face backlash from people who've bought the iPhone 16. In the Mac world, Apple has started updating all its base models to include 16GB of RAM, a trend expected to continue with the M4 MacBook Air soon.\nIncreasing the RAM in the iPhone 17 Pro would enhance Apple's AI features and boost its multitasking capabilities and gaming performance, especially as more AAA games become available on iOS. Another notable leak about the iPhone 17 Pro suggests that the phone will feature a new rectangular camera bar design reminiscent of the Pixel 9 Pro. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 series, including the new iPhone 17 Air, this September.\nRelated\n Unlock your Apple TV with a VPN and thank me later\nYou can unlock more content on your Apple TV and stream shows and movies from just about anywhere by doing this one thing.",

    "text": "Skip to main content\nDodgers' Muncy leaves game with apparent knee injury\nLos Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy left Wednesday's game in the top of the sixth inning after sustaining what appeared to be a knee injury in a collision with Chicago White Sox baserunner Michael A. Taylor.\nTaylor was attempting to steal third and collided with Muncy while sliding into the base, upending the Dodgers fielder who immediately grabbed his knee after hitting the ground. He was eventually helped to the clubhouse with a heavy limp.\nThe 34-year-old entered Wednesday's contest hitting .252 with 13 home runs, 55 RBI and an .838 OPS.\nMuncy is a three-time All-Star who has won two World Series championships with the Dodgers in 2020 and 2024.\nLong-time Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw recorded his 3,000th career strikeout later in the same at-bat, catching Vinny Capra looking to end the inning. Kershaw, 37, becomes the 20th pitcher in major league history to reach the mark and is the third among active players, joining Justin Verlander of the San Francisco Giants and the Toronto Blue Jays’ Max Scherzer.",

    "text": "C’est sa sœur Sonia qui en a fait l’annonce sur les réseaux sociaux, jeudi soir. «Reggie était un habitué de l’adversité, mais malheureusement, cette fois-ci la partie n’était pas loyale, a-t-elle écrit sur Facebook. Sa fin de vie aura été à l’image de son parcours sur terre, il se sera battu jusqu’à la fin…» Lors de son stage junior dans les Bois-Francs, le produit des Riverains du Richelieu s’est illustré sur la patinoire tout en étant victime de plusieurs humiliations en raison de la couleur de sa peau. L’un des événements les plus marquants de ces trois années est survenu au domicile des Saguenéens, le Centre Georges-Vézina de Chicoutimi. «Ce soir-là, pour une raison que je ne connais pas, des partisans m’ont lancé des bananes sur mon chandail. J’avais autour de 18 ans, j’étais pratiquement un adolescent», s’était-il remémoré lors d’un entretien avec le RDS.ca en 2015. Un gars «chanceux» Le numéro 77 porté par Savage à Victoriaville a été retiré par l’équipe junior de l’endroit en 2011. Ce dernier s’est toujours montré reconnaissant envers son ancienne formation junior, s’estimant «chanceux» d’avoir pu revêtir l’uniforme jaune et noir des Tigres. «J’ai pu évoluer avec de très bons joueurs comme Stéphane Fiset, Yves Racine, Daniel Gauthier, Guy Darveau, Patrick Lebeau, François Leroux et plusieurs autres, avait-il dit dans la même entrevue. Mais j’ai aussi été dirigé par Guy Chouinard et Gilbert Perreault. J’ai profité de très bons exemples avec ces entraîneurs et ils m’ont aidé à me former comme jeune homme.» Encore un pas à franchir Dans toutes les entrevues qu’il a accordées au fil des ans, il saluait les avancées faites contre le racisme, mais soulignait encore les progrès à faire avant de crier victoire. «Il y aura un très grand pas de franchi quand on nommera des entraîneurs ou des directeurs généraux noirs», affirmait-il dans une entrevue accordée au site de la LHJMQ. Choix de premier tour (15e au total par les Capitals de Washington), Savage a joué 34 parties dans la LNH, dont la moitié avec les Nordiques de Québec, en plus de connaître une carrière dans la Ligue américaine et en Europe. Son fils Félix-Antoine a lui aussi évolué dans la LHJMQ entre 2012 et 2014 avec Victoriaville et Rimouski.",

    "text": "Cuando hablamos de productos comestibles que solían fabricarse y venderse en el país, es imposible que no nos generen fuertes sentimientos de nostalgia y cariño. A continuación te contamos cuáles son los chocolates, snacks y golosinas populares de los años 90 y 2000 que marcaron la infancia de muchos argentinos consumidores.\nMirá También: Una golosina argentina fue elegida como la mejor del mundo, según un ranking gastronómico\nQué productos fueron los más exitosos de la época\nSupieron ganarse nuestro afecto y lograr que los recordáramos por sus increíbles sabores. Tristemente, el paso del tiempo generó que la gente dejara de consumirlos y es por eso que ya no están hoy en las góndolas del supermercado, al alcance de nuestra mano. Estos son los productos más extrañados por los consumidores del país:\nSaladix Cross de Pollo: Su combinación entre snack crocante y sabor a pollo enamoró a muchos, pero la empresa habría discontinuado esa variedad por baja demanda, sin anunciarlo oficialmente.\nChocolate Tortuguita: Uno de los chocolates más sabrosos y crocantes, fabricado por Arcor, fue durante años uno de los favoritos del público infantil por su forma divertida y su relleno cremoso. A pesar de su fama, ya no aparece en kioscos ni supermercados.\nPapas Lays al Plato estilo papas fritas: Aclamadas por su sabor más casero y su textura distinta a las Lays tradicionales. Dejaron de producirse hace tiempo, aunque muchos recién ahora notan su ausencia.\nGomitas Mogul Duo: Famosas por su textura suave y su doble sabor, eran una de las golosinas preferidas por adolescentes. Lo cierto es que, ya no se producen en la planta local desde hace varios meses.\nMirá También: Quiso sorprender a su papá con su golosina favorita y la reacción se hizo viral: “Sale un alquiler”\n¿Por qué desaparecieron del mercado?\nTodas estas decisiones comerciales, se deben a los costos de producción y los cambios en la regularidad de compra del target al cuál apunta el producto. En algunos casos, las empresas priorizan sus líneas más rentables o ajustan su oferta a las nuevas tendencias saludables.\nSin mencionar que la inflación y las restricciones para importar ciertos insumos también influyen en la disponibilidad de productos en góndolas. Estos productos retirados suelen ser relanzados como ediciones limitadas o especiales, la mayoría de estas marcas no tiene previsto relanzarlos en el corto plazo.",
