    "text": "News ‘They’re basically saving our wonderful community’: Sylvan Lake dam modification finally underway Posted June 22, 2024 4:00 pm Mick Zawislak Follow @dhMickZawislak Alicia Dodd, Fremont Township highway commissioner, stands atop the Sylvan Lake dam in 2022. The spillway will be replaced, sanitary sewer relocated and steep slope softened as part of a $3.4 million dam modification project. Mick Zawislak/mzawislak@dailyherald.com, 2022 Initials and a date are well worn but still visible atop a concrete side of a century-old spillway. The letters recall the man who built the dam, while the date signals when one of the more distinctive communities in Lake County began to take shape.\nThe earthen dam built by August Schwerman to create the 32-acre Sylvan Lake — the main attraction for a private subdivision in Fremont Township’s wooded, rolling countryside — has held since. But as it was done without modern standards or oversight, experts say its useful life is over. And due to potential dangers downstream should it breach, it’s overdue for an upgrade, they say.\nConstruction equipment is being mobilized and Highland Drive, built atop the dam as the main entry to the community, closed as the $3.43 million Sylvan Lake dam modification project begins.\nIn coming weeks, a water main will be rerouted, the lake drained about 5 to 6 feet or roughly half its depth and sheet piling driven into the lake bottom to allow the old dam to be compacted, rebuilt and strengthened.\nThe goal is to protect the community and environment, officials say.\nAbout 50 residents, local officials and others gathered on the lakefront this past Tuesday for the ceremonial groundbreaking of a project envisioned and pursued through layers of government for about 17 years.\n“I have to be honest with you. Owning, maintaining and rebuilding a dam were not on my bucket list,” said Alicia Dodd, who as Fremont Township highway commissioner has jurisdiction.\nSince being appointed in 2019 and elected in 2021, Dodd has spent countless hours pursuing a resolution to a situation that began long before her tenure.\nCounty officials and others long have sought to address issues to protect against potential flooding downstream or the rupture of a sanitary sewer line over the spillway that would release raw sewage, potentially cutting service to 289 homes and requiring a massive clean up and repair.\nA sudden release of water also could wash away a portion of North Midlothian Road and Cripple Creek Drive, which is the entry to 137 homes in Long Grove, officials say.\nHowever, without modification and upgrades and a deadline to spend federal funds approaching, residents fear even a small failure would require the lake be drained.\n“They’re basically saving our wonderful community,” said Dave Benedeck, of the dam modification project. He grew up and has lived in the tight-knit enclave of about 190 homes since the 1970s.\nMany original residents are returning to what was created as a summer resort area but transitioned to a year-round location known for dedicated and active residents involved in community projects, festivals, events and general camaraderie.\nSylvan Lake volunteers in 2007 began seeking funding to improve the degraded spillway, Dodd said. Bleck Engineering Company Inc., spent 13 years of give and take with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources on the permitting process and a design, she added.\nIn early 2022, sponsored by the Lake County Stormwater Management Commission, U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, who represented the area at the time, secured a $1.3 million federal “pre-disaster mitigation” grant to proceed. Local sources would contribute the remainder of what was then a $1.7 million project.\nBut costs doubled. And with no additional federal funding available, the difference fell to local entities including homeowners, who voted to contribute $500,000.\n$1.34 million in federal funding will allow long-sought Sylvan Lake dam upgrade to proceed\n“The timing of this was important,” said Dan Trahan, president of the Sylvan Lake Improvement Association, a nonprofit established in 1940 to maintain the lake and common properties.\n“We’re talking about the existence of our community so it became a no-brainer,” he added. “It was overwhelming support to get this project off the ground.”\nWhen complete in October, gas, sanitary sewer and water lines that run through or near the dam will have been relocated, Schwerman’s culvert removed and replaced with a new lake intake system, and the steep slope to the creek below softened considerably.\nThe work will improve the dam’s design, increase public safety, reduce flood risk and protect critical infrastructure, explained Sharon Osterby, water resource professional with the stormwater management commission.\nA sidewalk with guardrails on the lake side and new pavement on Highland Drive are included.\nThe original culvert will be removed but the section with Schwerman’s inscription will be saved and displayed, Trahan said.\nLake lowering is scheduled to begin July 8. Many residents are curious what will be revealed and a “What Lies Beneath?” bingo event is said to be in the works.\n Construction equipment is being staged for a $3.4 million modification of the 100-year-old earthen Sylvan Dam in Fremont Township. A sidewalk with guardrails will be installed on the lake side.

However, we’re here to save you the hassle and assist you in any way possible! So, before purchasing a unit, make sure to take the following into consideration!\n- Thermostat\nA thermostat is a component which senses the temperature of a physical system and performs actions. As a result, the system is able to maintain the temperature at the ideal setpoint.\nThe thermostat on an air conditioner allows you to control the cooling output. In fact, middle to higher-end models will feature a digital thermostat. The thermostat shows both the selected temperature as well as the actual temperature.\n- Adjustable fan speed\nAdjusting the fan speed affects the rate at which you can cool down your space. Usually, you can select from two or three fan speeds. Note that the speed level also affects the level of noise the unit makes.\nIf you’re using air conditioner in a bedroom, then this feature is nice as you can select a lower, quieter, fan speed at night.\n- Remote control\nA remote control lets you operate the AC without having to use the controls mounted to the front. Standard remotes let you control and adjust the temperature and fan speed. Meanwhile, some have a temperature display on the remote control. It also comes in handy and proves convenient at the worst of times.\n- Type of filter\nStandard filters are the most common filter type. It is a basic filter and you will have to place it periodically to ensure proper air flow and filtration.\nMeanwhile, you can just clean washable filters in a sink to avoid having to buy a replacement. They are also commendably durable and can withstand several washes.\n- Energy Star Rating\nUnits with an Energy Star rating can operate up to 15% more efficiently than units that are not certified. Depending on how often you plan to utilize your window unit, energy efficiency may be something you want to consider.\n- BTUs\nBTUs are the traditional measurement unit of heat. In the air conditioning world, BTU is a measurement of the cooling capacity of your window air conditioner. The bigger the number of BTUs, the more powerful and higher cooling capacity will be of your A/C unit.\nAs a standard measurement, an air conditioner needs around thirty BTU for each square foot of living space that you wish to cool.\nConclusion\nAir conditioners have become a mandatory purchase for us, and it comes as no surprise that the market for this product is on fire, especially in the summers we’re facing right now.\nThey serve a great purpose in making life a little bit easy and help to breathe better. It makes the entire difference between a welcoming and scorchingly hot home.\nAll in all, air conditioners are a necessity that one cannot resist. Our favorite of the lot is the Pioneer Air Conditioner Ductless Wall Mount Mini Split since it is highly efficient. Moreover, its remote control and other convenient features add to the ease of use. Overall, it is absolutely worth the money!",

    "title": "Oh, fantastic. The world is such a better place now: UK successfully fires high-powered laser weapon that’s as fast as the speed of light and so accurate it can hit a £1 coin from half a mile away. Wow, amazing. So impressed. – David Icke",
    "text": "The UK has successfully fired a high-powered laser weapon as fast as the speed of light at an aerial target for the first time. In secret trials the DragonFire laser-directed energy weapon (LDEW) system proved so accurate it could hit a £1 coin half a mile away. The high-power laser was fired from a Ministry of Defence station in the Hebrides. Its range, like much of the technology behind it, remains classified. But its intense beam can cut through targets, such as drones, in its line of sight. It is also inexpensive. Each ‘shot’ costs around £10, according to defence sources. The Army and the Royal Navy are considering using the weaponry as part of future Air Defence missions. The weapon system is a £100million collaboration between the Government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and industry partners such as Leonardo and Qinetiq. It is not known when DragonFire could enter service. Grant Shapp, Defence Secretary, said: ‘This type of cutting-edge weaponry has the potential to revolutionise the battlespace by reducing the reliance on expensive ammunition, while also lowering the risk of collateral damage. ‘Investments with industry partners in advanced technologies like DragonFire are crucial in a highly contested world, helping us maintain the battle-winning edge and keep the nation safe.’ Dr Paul Hollinshead, Dstl’s chief executive, said: ‘These trials have seen us take a huge step forward in realising the potential opportunities and understanding the threats posed by directed energy weapons.’ UK defence is continuing to invest in these game-changing technologies and is advancing the plans which will ultimately bring them into service. Shimon Fhima, Director Strategic Programmes for the MOD, said: ‘The DragonFire trials at the Hebrides demonstrated that our world-leading technology can track and engage high-end effects at range. ‘In a world of evolving threats we know that our focus must be on getting capability to the warfighter and we will look to accelerate this next phase of activity.’ [Read More: UK successfully fires high-powered laser weapon](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12985591/UK-successfully-fires-high-powered-laser-weapon-thats-fast-speed-light-accurate-hit-1-coin-half-mile-away.html) [](https://shop.davidicke.com)",

    "title": "El Tribunal Electoral de México concluye que López Obrador cometió violencia de género contra Gálvez",
    "text": "Ciudad de México (EFE).- La Sala Especializada del Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación (TEPJF) mexicana concluyó este jueves que el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador cometió violencia política de género contra la excandidata presidencial opositora Xóchitl Gálvez.\nEl órgano, según un comunicado, determinó esta posición a raíz de “expresiones vertidas” por el mandatario en varias de sus conferencias diarias de junio y julio de 2023.\nFotografía de archivo de Xóchitl Gálvez en la ciudad de Monterrey (México). EFE/ Miguel Sierra Concretamente, el tribunal señaló que esta violencia se ejerció en las llamadas ‘mañaneras’ del 3, 5, 10, 11 y 14 de julio, y 3, 7 y 18 de agosto del año pasado.\n“El Pleno consideró que aquellas expresiones en las que el titular del Ejecutivo Federal afirma que la denunciante obtuvo una candidatura por decisión de un grupo de personas con poder político sí actualizan los parámetros de la infracción”, argumentó.\nY añadió que se produjo una “violencia simbólica” a partir del “carácter de mujer e indígena” de Gálvez porque se “reforzó” el estereotipo de “inferioridad o dependencia para acceder a cargos públicos”.\nSeñalamientos de Gálvez La entonces aspirante de la coalición opositora Fuerza y Corazón por México presentó desde mediados de julio de 2023 denuncias ante la autoridad electoral contra el mandatario y funcionarios de su Gobierno por el uso indebido de recursos públicos y violencia política de género.\nCitó como ejemplo mensajes publicados en X, difundidos en la cuenta oficial del Gobierno mexicano y sostuvo que, durante una semana, en las conferencias diarias se le exhibió como la “candidata de la oligarquía”.\nEl presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, participa durante su conferencia de prensa matutina en la Ciudad de México (México). EFE/Isaac Esquivel En su segundo señalamiento, Gálvez precisó que los mensajes de López Obrador cuestionaron “su capacidad por su calidad de mujer” y la redujeron al resultado de un consenso entre hombres.\nComo respuesta, el mandatario insinuó un mes después que él sufría violencia política de género ante los ataques de la oposición y del Tribunal Electoral, que ya sugirió sancionarlo.\n“Y también una pregunta, todo lo que me dicen a mí ¿No es violación de género o el género es nada más femenino?”, cuestionó durante su rueda de prensa matutina del 9 de agosto de 2023.\n¿Habrá consecuencias? Pese al fallo, el presidente no puede recibir sanciones por infracciones electorales, según el TEPJF, por lo que “únicamente se le responsabiliza” de los hechos.\nTampoco pueden dictarse “medidas de reparación integral”, como la inscripción del presidente en el Registro Nacional de Personas Sancionadas en Materia de Violencia Política en Razón de Género del Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE).\nPor otra parte, la Sala Especializada del TEPJF señaló a varios cargos cercanos a López Obrador, como el coordinador de Comunicación Social y vocero de la Presidencia, Jesús Ramírez, o la directora general de Comunicación Digital, Jessica Ramírez.\nPara estos casos y tres más que señala el comunicado, el TEPJF sí los inscribió durante un año y medio en el mencionado registro del INE y comunicó al Órgano Interno de Control de la Presidencia de la República su responsabilidad de “determinar lo que en derecho corresponda”.",
