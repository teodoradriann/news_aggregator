INQUIRER FILE PHOTO\nMANILA, Philippines — The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) condemned the bombing of a church in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).\nThe rights body stressed it denounces all acts of violence, especially those targeted against groups of certain religious beliefs, as these oppose the progress that has already been made in promoting religious freedom in the Philippines.\nADVERTISEMENT “It must be noted that last year, 05 December 2023, the CHR also issued a statement on the bombing of a Catholic Mass in Marawi City. This is the second time in a span of a few months that these bombings have occurred in places of worship in the BARMM,” it pointed out.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Chief Justice orders probe into P6-million bribery case vs a Pasay judge NEWSINFO There’s a ‘footnote’ to Zubiri ouster NEWSINFO Rep.

    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK. The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents. Systems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. Some forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate. Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74 Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34 The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion. – Gwent Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries. – Hampshire & Isle of Wight Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4 – Hertfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record. – Humberside Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2 – Kent Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6 The force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached. Markers are optional and added at the discretion of the inputting officer. – Lancashire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures had been compiled by searching for hate crimes marked as religious, followed by a manual review of each recorded crime to extract only those that were antisemitic and Islamophobic. – Leicestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 17, 2023 – 6 – Merseyside Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 20 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 10 The force said 18 of the 20 antisemitic offences in 2023 are conflict related and one of the 10 Islamophobic offences in 2023 is conflict related. – Norfolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 0 – North Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 – North Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 2 The force said the numbers are for offences “reported” to the police. – Northamptonshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures show crimes with a racial or religious flag against them, where the search was for the words “Jewish” “Hebrew” “Judaistic”, “Hasidic”, “Islam” and “Muslim”. The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures. – Northumbria Antisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim. – Nottinghamshire Antisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19 The force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker. – South Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8 Islamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9 The force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”. – Suffolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0 – Surrey Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10 The force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member. – Thames Valley Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21 Islamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20 – Warwickshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: No information held The force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods. – West Mercia Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4 – West Midlands Antisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22 Islamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25 The force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”. – West Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53 Islamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49 The force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted. The force added: “We continue to work to better improve the investigation of hate crime and the outcomes for victims. The force has specialist hate crime co-ordinators who assist investigating officers in identifying perpetrators, providing after-care support for victims and working with communities to increase awareness of hate crime and reporting mechanisms. They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.” – Wiltshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 Some 15 forces are not included in this list.

    "text": "Toronto, Dec 29 (IANS) A 41-year-old Indian-origin man has been arrested in connection with multiple robberies at Hindu temples in the Canadian province of Ontario in recent months, police said.\nJagdish Pandher from Brampton is facing charges for numerous offences and is currently being held for a bail hearing, the Durham Regional Police said on Thursday.\nInvestigators have linked Pandher to numerous break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year, most of which occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area.\nIn a media release, police said that on October 8 at approximately 12:45 am its officers responded to reports of a break-and-enter in progress at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering.\nA male was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes, the release said, adding that he fled the area prior to police arrival.\nHe was seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax.\n\"Although these offences occurred at places of worship, they do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate,\" Durham Regional Police said.\nAt least six Hindu temples were reportedly robbed in the month of September and October alone, mostly in the Greater Toronto Area, which included the Chintpurni Temple in Brampton, Rameshwar Mandir in Caledon and the Hindu Heritage Centre in Mississauga.\nAccording to local media reports, last year, close to half-a-dozen Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area were reportedly robbed in a span of ten days.\nThe Peel police in Toronto arrested three Canada-based Punjabi men in 2022 responsible for vandalism and theft in Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area from November 2021 until March 2022.\nPandher was one of the three accused, which also included Gursharnjeet Dhindsa and Parminder Gill from Brampton.\nThey were slapped with as many as 78 charges including Disguise with intent (13 counts each) and Break, enter and commit an indictable offence (13 counts each), according to media reports.\n--IANS\nmi/dan\nAdd Chart to Comment",

    "text": "Polémica por los aviones que “cortan” el granizo\nCientíficos advierten la falta de evidencia respecto a la efectividad y el impacto ambiental que puede ocasionar el uso sostenido de aviones y cañones “antigranizo”, una técnica para mitigar este fenómeno climático que sólo en Mendoza funciona bajo legislación. Comunidades rurales denuncian su uso también en San Juan, San Luis, La Rioja y Córdoba y aseguran que “disipan la lluvia” y profundizan el contexto de sequía en estos territorios.\nLa práctica es conocida como “siembra de nubes” y supone inyectar yoduro de plata en las nubes de tormenta con el objetivo de reducir el tamaño del granizo, hasta el punto incluso de que se derrita antes de caer al suelo, y evitar así los daños que puede provocar, especialmente en zonas productivas.\nLas inyecciones de este químico se realizan a través de cañones y bengalas que operan desde tierra o por vía aérea mediante aviones.\nEn las últimas semanas, productores ganaderos y pobladores rurales de distintas provincias del centro y oeste del país reavivaron con fuerza un reclamo que lleva más de 20 años contra la utilización de estas técnicas, al asegurar que “terminan dispersando las nubes” e impiden que llueva en un contexto de sequía y crisis hídrica, según declararon a medios provinciales.\nConsultado por Télam, Eldo Ávila, experto en Física de la Atmósfera de la Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC), sostuvo que “no se encuentran casos en que oficialmente se utilice esta técnica para inhibir tormentas pero bien puede ser que, al tratar de mitigar el granizo, se afecte a la lluvia secundariamente si se usa este producto en exceso y sin control”.\n“La modificación artificial de eventos meteorológicos es posible y se hace desde hace décadas para frenar el granizo, producir lluvia en lugares donde no llueve o nieve en mayor cantidad, como hacen en Chile”, sostuvo el también investigador del Conicet. Sin embargo, alertó que “introducir modificaciones artificiales siempre trae consecuencias y el problema es que nadie sabe cabalmente cuál es el efecto a largo plazo de esto”.\nEn Argentina, el gobierno provincial de Mendoza, una de las zonas del mundo más propensas al granizoo, comenzó ya en 1959 a experimentar distintos métodos para mitigar este fenómeno climático, que supone uno de los peligros más dañinos para los oasis agrícolas de ese territorio.\nEl Sistema Integral de Lucha Antigranizo, implementado por la Dirección de Contingencias Climáticas mendocina, destinó este año una inversión de siete mil millones de pesos en aviones y bengalas, según fuentes oficiales.\nRespecto a las dudas planteadas en torno a este sistema, el ministro de Producción mendocino, Rodolfo Vargas Arizu, expresó que se trata de “una creencia popular” y argumentó que “es una siembra de yoduro de plata para achicar granizo y de última hacer llover en un lugar en el que no iba a llover, pero no podés desplazar tormentas”.\nNegar la eficacia de estas técnicas, aseguró en diálogo con MDZ Radio, “es como decir que la tierra es plana y no es redonda”.\n“Sin embargo, la Organización Meteorológica Mundial resalta la falta de evidencia científica que posee la siembra de nubes para la reducción del granizo, cuyos resultados no han podido demostrar un efecto estadísticamente significativo”, sostuvo en diálogo con Télam Juan Rivera, doctor en Ciencias de la Atmósfera y de los Océanos del Programa Regional de Meteorología del Conicet.\nEn el marco de la Ley provincial 7334, el gobierno mendocino debe evaluar cada 30 días la efectividad y los impactos del sistema antigranizo.\n“No se sabe si esos informes se hacen, con qué datos o qué herramientas estadísticas utilizan, pero el sistema continúa funcionando a pesar de los constantes daños generados por el granizo que supuestamente se está mitigando”, apuntó el científico, quien instó a apostar por “la colocación de malla antigranizo para proteger los cultivos” y la adquisición de nuevas tecnologías que “permitirán conocer mejor desde el aspecto científico el desarrollo del granizo destructivo”.\nEn el resto del mundo, a partir de “la imposibilidad de demostrar estadísticamente su efectividad”, el sistema antigranizo es cada vez menos utilizado y atrás quedaron sus años de auge ligados a grandes experimentos en las décadas de 1970 y 1980.\nEn tanto, el rechazo a su uso moviliza también a comunidades de San Juan, San Luis, La Rioja y Córdoba donde, pese a no estar legislado, aseguran ver los aviones que se sumergen en las tormentas y oír los estruendos de los cañones “rompetormentas”.\nEl reclamo fue elevado a la justicia a través de denuncias elaboradas por productores ganaderos del departamento sanjuanino de Sarmiento –donde se solicitó un informe de impacto ambiental a especialistas que aún no se dio a conocer– y del municipio cordobés de Cruz del Eje.\nEn San Luis se elevó un pedido de “acción urgente frente a la modificación intencional del clima y las tormentas”, según indicaron medios locales. Asimismo, ambos investigadores cuestionaron “la falta de conocimiento” respecto al impacto ambiental del uso sostenido del yoduro de plata.\n“A estas escalas, sería importante que se estudie cuáles son los efectos positivos y negativos y se avance en su regulación, porque hacerlo sin control y después ver qué pasa puede resultar catastrófico. Si se inyecta en demasía se pueden contaminar las aguas y cuencas que bebemos”, advirtió Ávila.\nEntre otras investigaciones, un estudio de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid titulado “Riesgo potencial de toxicidad aguda inducida por la siembra de nubes de AgI (yoduro de plata) en el suelo y la biota de agua dulce” advierte sobre el impacto de las altas concentraciones de químicos utilizados en el sistema antigranizo, que consideran tóxico para los ecosistemas terrestres y acuáticos “si se acumulan grandes cantidades de materiales en el medio ambiente”.\n“Desconozco si el gobierno (mendocino) realiza mediciones de las concentraciones de químicos en agua y suelo”, acotó Rivera. “Todavía existe la creencia de que podemos controlar el clima a través de la geoingeniería. Lamentablemente lo hacemos pero para mal”, cerró el científico.\nConsultados por esta agencia sobre el tema, hasta el momento no se recibió respuesta del Ministerio de Producción mendocino.\n“Todavía existe la creencia de que podemos controlar el clima a través de la geoingeniería. Lamentablemente lo hacemos pero para mal”, cerró el científico.",

    "text": "Фотожурнал\nТоп новости разделов\nЛичное мнение\nНовости политики\n12 июня, 08:46\nЕвросоюз дал трещину. Отколоться рискуют два ключевых игрока\nЕдинство ЕС под угрозой. Франция и Бельгия, на словах горячо поддерживающие отказ от российских энергоносителей, выступили против полного запрета поставок СПГ и требуют от Еврокомиссии невозможного. Об их позиции - в материале Ласт Ньюс .\nПариж и Брюссель Не спешат выразить поддержку инициативу Еврокомиссии и хотят получить гарантии энергетической и юридической безопасности, пишет Политико.\nвспомним, в начале мая ЕК представила План, который предусматривакет полный отказ от импорта российских энергоносителей к 2027-му. В июне она хочет официально предложить Ввести запрет на все поставки как по новым договорам с российскими компаниями, так и по действующим спотовым контрактам. Ввести меру обязаны до окончания года.\n\" Два крупнейших покупателя российского сжиженного природного газа в Евросоюзе отказываются одобрить План Брюсселя по запрету поставок газа из России, утверждая, что им нужны дополнительные заверения в отношении экономических и правовых последствий этого шага, прежде чем принимать решение \", - сообщается в публикации Политико.\nТакая нерешительность противоречит позиции иных крупных импортеров в ЕС. Испания и Нидерланды готовы выразить поддержку проект закона, позволяющий защититься контрактов, которые вынуждали бы их годами закупать российский СПГ, пишет журнал.\nглава министерства энергетики Франции Марк Ферраччи опасается, что частные фирмы столкнутся с судебными исками из-за расторжения контрактов с Россией. Он сказал, что существующим договорам необходима юридическая защита. Но При этом обратил внимание: власти республики защищают \" европейскую стратегию диверсификации \". Например, Париж трудится над поиском альтернативных источников энергии и планирует перейти на продукцию из Катара.\nБельгия также выступает за поэтапный отказ от импорта российского СПГ и Не считает возможным восстановление энергетических связей с Москвой, сказал глава министерства энергетики Матье Биэ.\" Не стоит ждать, что со дня на день мы вернемся к обычному ведению бизнеса с РФ и будем действовать так, будто ничего Не было.<... > Это иллюзорные обсуждения \", - сказал Он в беседе Политико.\nПри этом от полного запрета Бельгия тоже отказывается - сперва желает получить отчет об экономических последствиях, А покуда хочет продолжать приобретать газ из России.\nСтрана уже потеряла деньги из-за европейских наказаний, подчеркивает ведущий специалист Фонда национальной энергетической безопасности и Финансового университета При правительстве России Игорь Юшков. Ранее Бельгия выступала перевалочным хабом - у \" Новатэка \" был договор на долгосрочную аренду мощностей по хранению и перевалке СПГ в порту Зебрюгге. Теперь порт его лишился.\" Кроме этого, государство является воротами в Cеверо-Западную Европу, то есть, зарабатывает на регазификации и транзите вглубь континента, к примеру в Германию \", - добавляет Юшков.\nБеспокойство Парижа объясняется наличием экономических связей с русским энергетическим сектором: часть акций российской газодобывающей организации \" Новатэк \" до нынешнего момента принадлежит французской TotalEnergies.\nКонтракты на закупку топлива с проекта \" Ямал СПГ \" и определенные Контракты на трубопроводный газ все еще действуют, напоминает заместитель руководителя Фонда национальной энергетической безопасности Алексей Гривач.\nза последний месяц СПГ из этого места как раз направлялся Большей частью в эти две страны, подчеркивает гендиректор Независимого аналитического агентства нефтегазового сектора ( \" НААНС-Медиа \" ) Тамара Сафонова. По ее оценке, среднемесячные объемы поставок СПГ с проекта \" Новатэк \" в европейский союз держатся на уровне 1, 8 миллиона тонн.\nсвежие наказания Не только положат им конец, Но также сделают проблемы для зарубежных акционеров проектов, включая китайские организации, которые перепродают газ в ЕС.\nПомимо этого, французы имеют возможность сильно пострадать на корпоративном уровне: TotalEnergies принадлежит доля в проектах \" Ямал СПГ \" и \" Арктик СПГ 2 \".\" Даже При том, что в настоящее время французы Не имеют возможность вывести деньги из России, они переживают, что потеряют их вовсе, по этой причине намеренно тормозят принятие решения. На мой взгляд, как раз в этом и заключается их стратегия: бесконечно обсуждать Детали этих наказаний, дожидаясь конца конфликта \", - подчеркивает Юшков.\nПлан вполне может сработать, считает Гривач - Франция имеет существенный вес в принятии решений на уровне ЕС и способна сделать коалицию против невыгодных для себя постановлений, Но многое зависит от геополитической обстановки.\nЕсли же запрет введут, все будет в зависимости от формулировки - коснутся ли лимиты только поставок российского СПГ на площадку ЕС или в общем приобретения топлива.\" Если речь пойдет о поставках, у французской стороны останется пространство для маневра - поскольку TotalEnergies выступает в виде трейдера, то может поставлять газ куда угодно, Не только в ЕС \", - комментирует Юшков.\nА вот о трубопроводном газе точно надо будет забыть, так как в контрактах зафиксированы точки отгрузки и получения. Однако, штрафов европейцам можно Не бояться, заявляет Юшков, - суды будут вставать на сторону европейских организаций, настаивая на том, что невыполнение обязательств вызвано форс-мажором и никакие взыскания Не применимы. Но Даже без юридических вопросов радикальный запрет несет массу экономических рисков, А так же среди них - новый виток энергетического падения.\nИсточник:\nРИА Новости\nКомментарии к новости\n[Добавить комментарий]\nКомментариев к этой новости пока нет.\nДобавьте\nпервым свой комментарий!\n[Добавить комментарий]\nХроника новостей\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n>>\n3304",
