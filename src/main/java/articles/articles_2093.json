    "title": "Malaysia's Okapi secures up to $2M in debt financing from Aquila to drive solar energy adoption in Southeast Asia",
    "text": "Okapi Technologies , a Malaysia-based climate fintech startup in the solar financing space, has announced the successful closing of an up to $2 million debt facility arranged by Aquila.\nOkapi said in a statement on Wednesday that this funding will accelerate the firm’s mission to expand solar energy adoption for homeowners and small businesses in Malaysia and Southeast Asia through innovative financial solutions.\nWith electricity tariffs in the firm’s home market of Malaysia set to rise in the second half of the year, which together with the National Policy on Climate Change 2.0 highlights the government’s efforts to shift towards a more sustainable low-carbon economy.\nWith this financing round behind them, Okapi plans to double down on its growth initiatives in Malaysia to capture these tailwinds while establishing beachheads in new markets in the region.\n“Despite significant cost reductions in small-scale solar installations over the past decade, high upfront investment requirements and supply chain inefficiencies still hinder\nwidespread adoption in Southeast Asia,\n“Aquila’s strong collaboration and alignment with our vision will be invaluable as we continue to bridge the financing gap and accelerate the green transition in the region,” said Lai Zhern Yung, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Okapi.\nAccording to the statement, Aquila’s partnership with Okapi reflects a shared commitment to revolutionizing sustainable finance in emerging markets through data-driven, technology-\nenabled financial solutions.\nThis investment highlights Aquila’s confidence in Okapi Solar’s ability to address financing challenges for homeowners and small businesses across the region.\n“Okapi’s business model—enabling engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors to offer a leasing model for solar installations—is fueling rapid growth,” said Stefano Pellegrino, Chief Executive Officer of Aquila.\n“Since their expansion depends on their ability to finance EPCs, this partnership aligns perfectly with our financing strategy,\n“Their focused approach to climate technology also enhances credit assessment efficiency, while API integration with solar installation data provides us with confidence in the value of deployed assets,” he added.\nOkapi is a residential solar financing platform in Southeast Asia.\nThe firm has more than 200 solar power systems financed, 50 installer-partners in its network across Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia.\nIts flagship residential solar leasing product, Okapi Solar, is transforming the solar market with its unique underwriting model and seamless point-of-sale mobile application.\nBy empowering solar installer-partners with the ability to offer zero upfront financing plans of up to ten years, the firm enables homeowners to access solar energy instantly with minimal financial barriers.\nAdditionally, Okapi recently introduced Okapi Flow, a supply chain financing solution that leverages proprietary data to provide procurement, logistics, and inventory financing for solar installer-partners.\nThis ensures that small businesses in the solar sector can grow faster and access financial products with greater ease and efficiency.\nAquila is an enabler of internet of things (IoT)-powered sustainable finance with operations across Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\nThe firm’s technology connects verifiers, borrowers, and banks to enable sustainable finance.\nIt reduces costs and risk of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) key performance indicators (KPIs) verification and monitoring by using real-time internet of things (IOT) data infrastructure.\nMalaysian climate fintech startup Okapi Technologies raises funding from The Radical Fund",

    "title": "Swan Valley Stampeders hockey team saved after quick community response - Winnipeg | Globalnews.ca",
    "text": "For 25 years, the Swan Valley Stampeders have been a junior hockey staple in Western Manitoba. But for a few hours this week, the team seemed as though it might come to an end. The team entered the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) in 1999, and hundreds of young men have rolled through that town, some from afar, others from right at home. Josh Tripp is one of the latter. A native of Swan River, he grew up looking up to Stampeders players — then becoming one. As of this year, he is coaching them. “If you have a kid in school, the Stamps are going there once, twice a week. I remember being a kid and it was awesome when the Stamps came to the school. They’re just a huge part of the community.” The community expressed that earlier this week, when the team put out a concerning statement , saying they were at risk of folding. Finances weren’t the issue. Instead, it was human resources — an understaffed and overworked volunteer board that needed more members. Team officials declined an interview with Global News the day after the release, but now say the response was quick, large, and positive. The Stampeders will play on for years to come. Tripp wasn’t surprised to hear people stepped up. He knows the team affects the community, just as much as the community affects the team. “Guys are kind of unsure about coming here – just with it being in the middle of nowhere in this small town,” he said. “Once they’re here for a while, they love it. And so many guys come back regularly just to visit.” [sent to your email, as it happens.](javascript:void(0)) That involvement is something the league’s brass has been focusing on in recent years. MJHL commissioner Kevin Saurette says there’s always work to do, but he’s proud of how far they’ve come. “These are young men, a lot of them living away from home, outside of where they grew up, and they embrace the role of ambassadors for their communities. To take all that on, along with playing elite junior hockey and going to school… I really commend the kids in our league.” While the league’s 13 teams are in a healthy position heading into the 2024-25 season, Saurette says the news this week shows how quickly that can change. “If that team leaves, what does that mean for youth hockey, for the community involvement, being a social gathering place… that sense of pride?” The struggle to find volunteers isn’t just an issue at hockey rinks. Volunteer Canada says 67 per cent of organizations are in a similar position to the Stampeders. Those in the know say COVID-19 changed everything. “During the pandemic, people got to experience slowing down,” explains Kamillah El-Giadaa, the Training and Development Manager for Volunteer Manitoba. “They didn’t have to run around to five different places any more, and people enjoyed that.” April 19 marks the end of National Volunteer Week, but the need remains. El-Giadaa hopes this year’s theme, “every moment matters”, rings far into the future. “Volunteering isn’t a 10-year commitment. It can be something you do once a month – once a year – based on your schedule and the skillset you want to offer. We’re trying to encourage folks that volunteering isn’t the massive commitment you think it is.” He says the organization’s website provides a plethora of resources , including a match-making system for people looking to experience what it’s like to sit on a board, and groups who need those board members. As for the MJHL, the league is recording playoff attendance numbers not seen since the days of NHLers Jordin Tootoo and Steve Lajoie in the early 2000s. “It’s very competitive, very strong communities. Year after year, our (player) advancement numbers are growing, to NCAA, major junior, U-Sports, even NHL prospects,” Saurette says. Hockey fans don’t have to look far back into history to find the most recent example of a MJHL alumnus achieving the highest goal. Sioux Valley, Man.’s Zach Whitecloud, who played parts of three seasons with the Virden Oil Capitals from 2013-16, won the Stanley Cup with the Vegas Golden Knights last year. Both Whitecloud and former Steinbach Piston Cole Smith are among the former MJHLers competing in this year’s Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Turnbull Cup Final, the league’s championship series, kicks off Friday in Niverville between the Pistons and Winkler Flyers.",

    "title": "The indisputable importance of Black fathers - Afro American Newspaper",
    "text": "By Walter Fields\nBeginning in 1954, America’s conception of a “good father” was through the lens of White patriarchy. Actor Robert Young’s portrayal of the fictional Jim Anderson in “Father Knows Best” established the defining qualities of an American father – White, middle class, white collar and hardworking, dominant and all-knowing. This typology was reinforced by subsequent television series, such as “Make Room for Daddy,” “My Three Sons,” “The Andy Griffith Show,” “Bachelor Father,” “The Courtship of Eddie’s Father” and “The Brady Bunch.” It was not until actor John Amos’ role as James Evans in television’s “Good Times” in 1974 that popular culture acknowledged the presence of Black men as the head of the household, while also being a caring and loving spouse. For much of the 20th century Black men were depicted in the media as estranged from their children, uncaring and irresponsible in their role as fathers.\nCritics of Black family life have cited Black male incarceration and unemployment rates, high school dropout data for young Black men, and Black teenage parental birth rates as evidence of the irresponsibility of Black fathers, placing the onus on individual behavior, while ignoring the systemic factors driving these conditions.\nThis narrative was driven by historical bias and contemporary public policy that undermined the desire of Black men to fulfill their fatherly duties. A 2013 National Center for Health Statistics report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) effectively upended the mythology around Black fathers. Most notably, the report indicated that compared to their White and Hispanic fathers, Black men are more involved fathers– participating in activities like sharing meals with their children, bathing, diapering, dressing and reading to their children. The study showed that Black men actively play several nurturing roles.\nThe report indicated that 2.5 million Black fathers live in a household with their children compared with 1.7 million who do not – contradicting the imagery of most Black children living in fatherless homes. Even in instances when Black men are not in the home, they make an effort– sometimes extraordinary effort– to be involved in the lives of their children. So, why has America believed the worst about Black fathers?\nThe CDC report confirmed what many Black Americans knew, despite how media and public officials portray Black men in society. Many Black people have experienced and witnessed the Black father the research identifies. I am one of those people. My father, now deceased, was committed to the care and upbringing of his children. Possessing no more than an eighth-grade education, my dad was a blue-collar worker who cooked meals for his children, danced with his daughters, sewed school dresses for his daughters and always had time for his boys. He did this against the backdrop of being a southerner, driven north by Jim Crow. He was also a World War II veteran denied the benefits of the GI Bill because he was Black.\nThe negative perception of Black fathers is rooted in racism. Americans have been socialized to believe Black men are irresponsible, violence prone, dangerous, lazy and hyper-sexual. Ironically, it has been the historical treatment of Black men that have put them at a relative disadvantage to White men in their role as fathers. From the separation of Black families during the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the emasculation of Black men during enslavement, to lynchings and subjugation under Jim Crow, and present-day public policy, the agency of Black men has been an act of resistance.\nBlack fatherhood has been a social movement; a conscious repudiation and rejection of deliberate efforts to excise Black men from their families. It has not been enough for Black men to become a father by biology, we have had to navigate the waters of structural racism to overcome barriers to our engagement with our children.\nIf America is serious about “family values,” public policy needs to address areas of civic life that disproportionately penalize Black men. This includes reforming a criminal justice system that dehumanizes the convicted. We need to embrace policies that facilitate successful reentry into society, ending the criminalization of Black men, adopting sensible and reasonable child-support mandates, and liberalizing custodial rights. We need to support Black men as they enter college and workforce training, and support mental wellness and the treatment of chronic illnesses that have a disparate impact upon them.\nAs U.S. Census projections predict further changes in the racial composition of the nation’s population, Black men can no longer be an afterthought. It was not until 1984 and the premier of “The Cosby Show” that popular culture provided an image of Black fatherhood that approximated the White standard of “Father Knows Best.” Data shows that Black fathers know best– but it was not until the character Dr. Heathcliffe Huxtable appeared on “The Cosby Show” that the nation seemingly admitted the positive influence of Black fathers. The Cosby Show led to Robert Townsend’s character Robert Peterson in “The Parent ‘Hood,” and Anthony Anderson’s role as Andre Johnson in “Black-ish,” to name a few, that began to reflect what the CDC captured in its research.\nNow, public policy must play catch up. Black fatherhood must evolve from acting out of survival –in James Evans mode– to a respected, supported and celebrated member of American culture and life.",

    "text": "It might have initially felt good knowing Bill Belichick wouldn’t be joining the Atlanta Falcons, but reality is soon about to set in for New England Patriots fans. The Falcons reportedly plan to hire Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris as their next head coach, skipping over Belichick in the process. That decision could have a ripple effect on the Patriots, negatively impacting their search for an offensive coordinator. It’s a move that might have actually torpedoed their chances at some top candidates. More Patriots Rams pass game coordinator/quarterbacks coach Zac Robinson reportedly is a “strong candidate” to be the offensive coordinator in Atlanta, according to Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports. Robinson is one of two coaches remaining on the open market that interviewed with the Patriots . Story continues below advertisement The other? Rams tight ends coach Nick Caley. If Robinson and/or Caley decide to join their colleague in Atlanta, that could leave Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo back to square one in trying to find his new OC. Josh McDaniels has always felt like an option, but outside of another reunion with him, the options are limited. That might leave New England looking to use a two-person approach to the job, without giving anyone free reign over the unit. [Leave a comment.](javascript:void(0)) If you want to make matters worse, it’s been reported that the Patriots job isn’t “highly coveted” among the candidates. Yikes.

    "text": "Pope Francis could consider resigning if his health deteriorates, Italian Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi said in a radio interview on Thursday. \"If he found himself in a situation where he was compromised in his ability to have direct contact with people, then I believe he might consider resigning,\" Ravasi said. He described the pope's condition as \"complex, but not critical.\" French Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline also did not rule out resignation. Regarding speculation that Francis could follow the example of his predecessor, Benedict XVI, Aveline said: \"Everything is possible.\" Benedict XVI resigned in 2013 and lived a secluded life in the Vatican until his death at the end of 2022. Pope Francis has repeatedly rejected rumours of his possible resignation. However, some time ago he announced that he had deposited a signed letter of resignation at the Vatican Secretariat of State at the beginning of his term of office - but only to take effect if he were incapacitated and too severely affected by a serious illness to carry out his duties.",
