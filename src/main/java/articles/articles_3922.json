    "text": "Videos by OutKick\nIs that an Olympic luge performance I see? Nope. It’s just a Buffalo Bills fan sliding shirtless down a snow-filled tube.\nA stampede of Buffalo faithful showed up to Highmark Stadium to help get the arena ready for tomorrow’s\nAFC Wild Card matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The game got postponed because of a severe winter storm that slammed the city, and left the stadium looking like the Antarctic on Saturday.\nThe franchise also offered quite the list of benefits for anyone who showed up.\n“Shovelers can shovel snow throughout the night on Saturday into Sunday morning if needed. The rate of pay is $20 per hour. Complimentary food and breaks will be provided throughout the shifts in a comfortable warm area. Those interested in shoveling must have proper photo identification (driver’s license, state ID) to work,” the team said in a\nstatement.\nLike OutKick’s Mike Gunzlemann\nsaid, I’d easily sign up to help if I were in Buffalo. I’m a New England Patriots fan so naturally, I should hate the Bills. But if I could be a part of this unique experience – and get some pretty good cash along the way – I’d grab my shovel faster than Mac Jones could throw an interception!\nOne Bills Fan Turned The Shoveling Experience Into A Sledding Excursion\nThe only problem was actually getting there. All of the surrounding roads offered no reasonable visibility just hours ago, during what would have been the midway point if the game started today.\nDespite the crazy weather conditions, the Bills Mafia found ways to arrive for work.\nThe task for the fans involved taking shovelfuls of snow and placing it in a plastic chute. That same shut would channel the snow onto the field, and other workers would place it in trucks to haul it away.\nLike I said, these chutes were designed to carry snow. But if you put a makeshift slide in front of people who are crazy enough to jump on tables, you know something wild is bound to happen.\nOne fan saw an opportunity for some good-natured fun. He got himself into the chute and slid toward the bottom – with no shirt on. While it was snowing.\nMy chest got cold just watching that. But did I also laugh? You bet I did.\nBills fans truly are a national treasure and need to be preserved at all costs. You can always count on members of Bills Mafia to turn anything into a memorable experience.",

    "title": "100 days without load-shedding‚ and less spent on gas turbines: Eskom",
    "text": "100 days without load-shedding‚ and less spent on gas turbines: Eskom The last time the country enjoyed a prolonged period without load-shedding was from September 8 to December 11 2020. This comes alongside a decrease in the use of open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs) to supplement generation capacity. OCGTs are used to help meet high electricity demand during peak times. “The 100 days milestone includes around a R6.2bn reduction in OCGT diesel expenditure from April 1 to June 30 2024‚ compared to the same period last year. If we maintain our trajectory on reduced diesel spend‚ it will be a strong driver in a possible return to profit in FY25‚” said Eskom CEO Dan Marokane. “Considering the intensity and levels of load-shedding in 2023‚ the ability to get to 100 days without load-shedding is significant‚ while acknowledging the risk of load-shedding continues to exist.” Bheki Nxumalo‚ group executive for generation‚ said: “The achievement of 100 continuous days without load-shedding is the outcome of diligent execution of recovery plans and the tireless efforts of our 40‚000 dedicated and skilled Eskom employees. “If we maintain a 70% energy availability factor (EAF) and add significant capacity within the country‚ we can ensure adequate available capacity to meet demand without a significant risk of load-shedding.” The EAF has increased from 54.56% at the end of FY23/24 to a year-to-date achievement of 61.50%‚ an increase of 6.94% over the past three months. Eskom said the reprieve was due to its generation operational recovery plan‚ initiated in March 2023‚ and aggressive planned maintenance‚ both made possible by financial support from the National Treasury debt relief scheme for the utility. “Our immediate focus remains on implementing the generation operational recovery plan‚ aiming to recover about 1‚600MW from the generation coal fleet after the successful commercial operation of Kusile unit 5 and 930MW from Koeberg unit 2 before the end of the calendar year. This will significantly improve the EAF by the end of March 2025.” TimesLIVE Would you like to comment on this article? Register (it's quick and free) or sign in now.

    "title": "Aucune limite pour Grok? Le générateur d’images par intelligence artificielle d’Elon Musk crée de fausses photos réalistes qui envahissent X | TVA Nouvelles",
    "text": "De nombreux utilisateurs de la plateforme X s’amusent, depuis mercredi, à tester les limites du nouveau générateur d’images par Grok, l’intelligence artificielle (IA) d’Elon Musk. • À lire aussi: Désinformation et élections: Meta tempère la menace de l’IA générative • À lire aussi: Intelligence artificielle: les cégeps toujours «dans le brouillard» Les fausses images, tantôt d’un réalisme effrayant, tantôt bizarres, déplacées et dérangeantes, envahissent le réseau social. La fonction, offerte uniquement aux utilisateurs payants de X, permet d’écrire une description de l’image souhaitée dans l’outil Grok, qui génère ensuite l’image pour qu’elle puisse être publiée sur l’ancien Twitter. Le hic, c’est que Grok ne semble pas avoir de limites sur le type de contenu généré, une situation qui peut s’avérer dangereuse pour la désinformation et les abus. Par exemple, certains utilisateurs ont généré des images montrant notamment Elon Musk ou Donald Trump, une arme d’assaut en main, devant une marre de sang. Le New York Magazine s’est d’ailleurs amusé à tester Grok en générant des photos plus politiques. L’une d’entre elles montre Donald Trump, arme d’assaut en main, suivi par des militants de l’État islamique (EI) devant la Maison-Blanche. Photo tirée du New York Magazine Le média CNN s’est aussi prêté au jeu en demandant à Grok de créer une image avec la demande suivante : «Génère une image d’Elon Musk qui mange un steak dans un parc et qui passe un merveilleux moment». Photo tirée de CNN Plusieurs inquiétudes soulevées Si la plupart des générateurs d’images par IA ont des limites claires pour éviter que des photos générées n’aient pas de contenu violent, sexuel ou qui alimente la désinformation, celle de Grok, elles, sont plutôt floues. Le média britannique The Guardian rapporte avoir vu des images générées par Grok dans lesquelles on pouvait voir «Donald Trump pilotant un avion dans les tours du World Trade Center ou encore une représentation de Taylor Swift, Kamala Harris et Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez portant de la lingerie». Grok ne bloque pas, non plus, les demandes impliquant des personnages protégés par le droit d’auteur. Plusieurs utilisateurs X ont d’ailleurs partagé de fausses images mettant en vedette le célèbre personnage de Disney Mickey Mouse. The Guardian compare Grok à ChatGPT, une IA qui génère aussi des images d’après des demandes écrites, au sujet des règles d’utilisation. «Chat GPT, en revanche, rejette des demandes d’images [comme celles mentionnées précédemment] en citant des termes d’utilisation qui empêchent les représentations de violences du monde réel, le manque de respect envers des personnalités religieuses et les contenus explicites.» Il faudra donc redoubler de prudence avec les images qui circuleront prochainement sur le réseau social X, en particulier pendant la campagne électorale américaine pour l’élection présidentielle du 5 novembre qui fait déjà l’objet de nombreuses campagnes de désinformation.",

    "title": "Xagħra Basilica's 1913 Crucifix Restored: Century-old Devotion Renewed in Malta",
    "text": "The recent restoration of the Xagħra basilica's crucifix, integral to the eight Passion statues and created by Luigi Guacci's firm in Lecce, Italy, has reinvigorated a century-old devotion. Since its arrival in 1913, the crucifix has been a central figure of worship, and this year highlights the 100th anniversary of the Mary Magdalene statue, further enriching the Good Friday procession traditions in Malta.\nAdvertisment Historical Significance and Restoration Efforts The crucifix and the Passion statues have held a special place in the hearts of the Xagħra parish community for over a century. Crafted by Luigi Guacci's firm, these artworks represent a significant cultural and religious heritage. The Atelier del Restauro of Naxxar undertook the delicate task of restoring the crucifix, ensuring that the original craftsmanship and aesthetic are preserved for future generations. This restoration comes at a poignant time, marking the centennial celebration of the arrival of the statue of Mary Magdalene, enhancing the historical narrative of the Passion statues at Xagħra basilica.\nUnique Artistic and Cultural Heritage Advertisment The Xagħra Passion statues are renowned for being the largest set created by Guacci for a single parish church, highlighting their unique status within the Maltese islands. The statues' intricate detail and artistic excellence not only contribute to their religious significance but also underscore their value as cultural artifacts. The restoration project has brought renewed attention to the craftsmanship and artistry of the early 20th century, showcasing the enduring legacy of Guacci's work in Malta.\nGood Friday Procession and Community Devotion The Good Friday procession at Xagħra basilica, featuring the newly restored crucifix and the Passion statues, is a deeply rooted tradition that brings the community together in reflection and devotion. Scheduled to commence at 6pm, this event is part of a wider celebration of Good Friday across Malta, with other processions taking place in San Lawrenz, San Ġorġ, Victoria, Nadur, and Żebbuġ. The procession is not only a display of religious fervor but also a testament to the community's commitment to preserving its heritage and fostering a sense of unity.\nAs the Xagħra basilica's crucifix resumes its place among the Passion statues, its restoration symbolizes more than the preservation of art; it represents the continuity of a century-old tradition of faith and devotion. The efforts to maintain and celebrate this significant part of Malta's cultural and religious landscape underscore the deep connections between art, history, and community identity. As the Good Friday procession unfolds, it invites reflection on the enduring impact of these traditions on the collective memory and spiritual life of the community.",

    "text": "By Annette Cary ,\n2 hours ago\nA closed Sunnyside company that sold juice for school lunch programs and its owner have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from inspections that found filthy, putrid and decomposing juice products, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Eastern Washington.\nFood and Drug Administration inspections of facilities owned by Valley Processing in 2018 found visible mold, animal urine and feces, and decomposing corpses of birds, rodents and insects in juice products, according to court documents.\nOne inspector reported seeing and photographed a concrete tank of juice concentrate with a layer of mold and crust so thick and hard that a rat was walking on top of it, according to court documents.\nMary Ann Bliesner, the primary owner and president of the company, pleaded guilty this week to misdemeanor charges of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce and failure to register a food facility.\nFood and Drug Administration inspectors took this photo of a rat on a layer of crust and mold in a tank of grape juice concentrate atValley Processing in Sunnyside, according to a court document. Eastern District of Washington U.S. Attorney's Office Valley Processing also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to introduce adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce.\nIt acknowledged that between October 2012 and June 2019 it had conspired to distribute tainted and potentially unsafe apple and grape juice to customers in the United States, which included school lunch programs, and to customers abroad.\n“In this case, the company’s actions put at risk the health of consumers, including schoolchildren, who consumed the fruit juice,” said Special Agent in Charge Robert Iwanicki of the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office.\nValley Processing sentencing The Eastern Washington District U.S. Attorney’s Office and defense attorneys have agreed to recommend that U.S. Judge Stanley Bastian sentence Bliesner, 83, to three years probation and require her and her company to forfeit about $742,000 to the federal government, the estimated proceeds from selling potentially tainted juice and juice concentrate.\nSentencing is set for March 26.\nThe company admitted in a plea agreement this week that it blended grape juice concentrate, which had been stored outside for years and exposed to the elements, with newer grape juice concentrate and sold the resulting blended grape juice to unsuspecting customers as new grape juice with a new lot number and production date.\nValley Processing in Sunnyside was accused of blending grape juice concentrate, which had been stored outside for years and exposed to the elements, with newer grape juice concentrate to sell. Eastern District of Washington U.S. Attorney's Office In November 2020, the United States filed a civil complaint in federal court to end the production and sale of Valley Processing products.\nTwo months later Valley Processing and Bliesner agreed to stop all operations and sales without FDA approval and the company then shut down.\nThe criminal case was filed in 2022.\nFDA tipped to unregistered facilities Problems came to light with Valley Processing after the FDA was tipped off in 2018 that the plant had storage facilities that it had not registered with the FDA to prevent the FDA from inspecting them, according to court documents.\nIn 2016, Bliesner told inspectors that the plant consisted of three main processing plants at 108 Blaine Ave. and nearby frozen storage facilities.\nShe concealed from inspectors that two buildings elsewhere were used to store food product, including a facility on Grape Road with hundreds of thousands of gallons of grape juice concentrate, according to a court document.\nA photo filed in federal court shows apparent mold growing inside plastic bags holding grape product to be made into juice concentrate Valley Processing in Sunnyside. Eastern District of Washington U.S. Attorney's Office In 2018, she told inspectors who had been alerted to additional food storage sites that the Grape Road facility was “off-limits” and that it had been unsafe to enter for three years, according to court documents.\nShe told staff to place caution tape at the entrance and stairs leading to tanks holding grape concentrate, according to the indictment in the case.\nTests of samples of the concentrate stored at the facility found it was contaminated with bird and rodent feces, fur, insects, decaying remains of animals, mold, yeast and other contaminants, according to a court document.\nThe facility was used to store product from past grape harvests, some years ago, according to court documents.\nIt had some grape juice stored in a cold room and in refrigerated storage tanks, but also had three 26,000-gallon capacity tanks that were open to the elements were insufficiently cooled by an air condenser that blew cool air across their tops, according to a court document.\nThe former Valley Processing Inc. plant in Sunnyside is shown. It is accused of selling rotten and contaminated fruit juice, including for school lunch programs. Amanda Ray/Yakima Herald-Republic file At times they were partially covered by a plastic liner.\nJust two months before inspectors saw the live rat in one tank, the plant had transferred 105,000 gallons of grape juice concentrate into 55 gallon drums to prepare grape juice concentrate for shipment and sale, according to a court document.\nHowever, because the juice did not meet customer specifications, this grape juice concentrate was never sold nor shipped, according to the plea agreement.\nMoldy, rotten grape product Inspectors also learned of and inspected the plant’s Blaine Avenue facility, finding drums in May 2018 that had juice concentrate and juice stored outside at ambient temperature. Some had been rotting and fermenting for years, according to the indictment.\nSome of it was produced as early as 2011, but was still being used to fill customer orders, some as-is and some blended with newer product, but not necessarily repasteurized, according to a court document.\nInspectors also found solid sediments that had settled to the bottom of drums of grace juice concentrate, filling a quarter of the drums with what were called “bottoms.”\nA photo filed in federal court shows apparent mold growing inside plastic bags holding grape product to be made into juice concentrate Valley Processing in Sunnyside. Eastern District of Washington U.S. Attorney's Office During seasonally slow times at Valley Processing, water would be added to the bottoms and the mixture would be reprocessed, according to a court document.\nThe intent was to conceal the old, rotten and moldy grape bottoms and sell the resulting juice concentrate as recently produced product, according to a court document.\n“Bliesner and her company, Valley Processing, produced juice in filthy and unsafe conditions, mis-labeled that product, and then sold it to the National School Lunch Program that serves low-income school children,” said U.S. Attorney Vanessa Waldref for the Eastern District of Washington.\n“School children deserve safe and nutritious food. Nothing is more important that the health and safety of our children,” she said.\nCompany allegedly skipped testing Bliesner and Valley Processing also were accused of falsifying information about tests for dangerous contaminants or not doing tests.\nFrom summer 2017 to summer 2018 the plant shipped 19 lots of apple juice concentrate that had been blended or reworked from 2016 product.\nThe concentrate was not checked for arsenic, a potential problem for apple juice products, until late summer 2018, according to the indictment.\nValley Processing of Sunnyside admitted blending potentially tainted grape juice concentrate with newer grape juice concentrate and selling it.

    "text": "Il maltempo sta continuando a infierire sulla già martoriata Spagna. L’Agenzia meteorologica spagnola ha attivato l’allerta arancione in alcune zone delle province di Valencia , Castellón e Tarragona . L’allerta rossa questa mattina è stata attivata in alcune zone della costa di Huelva , in Andalusia . Situazione critica nella notte nella provincia di Huelva, dove un violento nubifragio ha provocato allagamenti sia nella città omonima sia in altre località limitrofe. “ Per favore, non uscite di casa a meno che non sia imprescindibile, ” ha chiesto il governatore dell’Andalusia, Juanma Moreno .\nSituazione drammatica anche in una zona rurale nei presi di Jerez de la Frontera, in provincia di Cadice : la piena del fiume Guadalete ha portato all’evacuazione preventiva di circa 200 persone.\nL’Agenzia meteorologica spagnola AEMET ha decretato un’allerta arancione per forti piogge e temporali a Maiorca e Minorca , dove potrebbero accumularsi precipitazioni di 120 litri per metro quadro in poche ore. A Maiorca sospese le attività all’aperto, chiusi i parchi e i cimiteri.\nA Valencia, oltre 360mila ancora senz’acqua. Cresce l’emergenza A 3 giorni dalla catastrofe provocata dalla DANA (“Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos” e comunemente chiamata “goccia fredda”) nella regione di Valencia, che ha provocato finora 158 morti , continuano senza sosta le ricerche dei dispersi, il cui numero resta ancora imprecisato. L’emergenza resta alta dopo che circa 366mila abitanti di una ventina di municipi sono ancora senza acqua potabile mentre 50mila sono al buio. Per la mancanza di acqua a causa delle condotte scoppiate per l’inondazione, in alcuni comuni non è possibile procedere con la pulizia del fango che nel frattempo si è seccato. Altri 500 soldati si uniranno oggi agli oltre 1.200 impegnati nell’emergenza nella regione dove è previsto anche l’arrivo del ministro dell’Interno, Fernando Grande-Marlaska. La priorità è garantire beni di prima necessità, come acqua, cibo e medicine, alle popolazioni colpite.\nLa Comunità Valenciana resterà isolata dai collegamenti ferroviari con Madrid e in parte dalla Catalogna per almeno 2 settimane dopo i danni notevoli alla ferrovia: inoltre, 150 arterie della rete stradale sono devastate, mentre restano interrotti vari tratti dell’autostrada A7 di collegamento con Madrid, con colonne di decine di campion e auto fermi ai margini dell’autostrada.",

    "title": "La elección más increíble en la historia de Francia | La Nación",
    "text": "Con el llamado a elección parlamentaria anticipada, tras la derrota de su partido en la de junio al Parlamento Europeo, el presidente francés, Emmanuel Macron , esperaba “ aclarar ” la situación política, en beneficio propio. Es evidente que fracasó. La elección no produjo ninguna mayoría parlamentaria , solo confundió más las cosas. Con muchos perdedores y muy pocos ganadores, es la elección más sorprendente de la historia moderna del país. Uno de los numerosos perdedores es Agrupación Nacional (RN por la sigla en francés), el partido de ultraderecha que hace unas semanas se aseguró una victoria decisiva y sorprendente en la elección europea. Pese a haber aumentado su cantidad de escaños y convertirse en el partido más numeroso en la Asamblea Nacional, RN estuvo muy lejos de sus expectativas. La segunda vuelta de la elección mostró una fuerte movilización contra RN , en la que los votantes hicieron un desplazamiento táctico del centro a la izquierda y de la derecha al centro. Al parecer, muchos franceses concluyeron durante la campaña que los candidatos de RN no tenían aptitudes para gobernar. Ultraderecha obligada a negociar La mayoría de los analistas se había convencido de que la inmunidad natural del sistema electoral francés contra la ultraderecha había dejado de funcionar. Pero esta elección demostró lo contrario. Aunque la ultraderecha es hoy la principal fuerza política del país, no puede hacer nada sin aliados, y no tiene ninguno. El segundo perdedor es Macron, cuyo partido perdió unos 100 escaños. Antes de la elección, su agrupamiento Ensemble podía ser base de una mayoría relativa. Pero ahora lo superó el izquierdista Nuevo Frente Popular (NFP), principal vencedor en el reparto de escaños. Sin embargo, aunque es probable que Macron tenga que designar un nuevo primer ministro de izquierda, al NFP todavía le faltan unos cien escaños para la mayoría absoluta. Además, es una coalición laxa cuyos miembros tienen muchas diferencias y cuyo líder, Jean‑Luc Mélenchon (de Francia Insumisa) tiene un único objetivo: radicalizar el debate público y crear condiciones para que la elección presidencial del 2027 se convierta en un duelo entre él y Marine Le Pen, candidata de RN. De modo que un gobierno de izquierda exitoso (con otra primera figura) no le sería necesariamente útil. Para que Mélenchon obtenga un beneficio personal, sería necesario que el NFP pueda poner en práctica todo su programa electoral; pero eso no sucederá jamás sin la mayoría absoluta. Además, el próximo gobierno (cualquiera que sea su forma definitiva) pronto tendrá que responder ante la Comisión Europea, que hace poco inició un “procedimiento de déficit excesivo” contra Francia. Sin embargo, todavía está muy lejos el día en que el NFP se rompa. Más allá de las muchas críticas que recibieron los socialistas y los verdes por aliarse con Mélenchon a pesar de las diferencias fundamentales que los separan, el esquema redituó en las urnas. Los 40 escaños adicionales que ganó la izquierda fueron todos para socialistas y verdes, mientras que Francia Insumisa no hizo nuevos avances. Es imposible no recordar la coalición de izquierda liderada por el presidente francés François Mitterrand tras la elección de 1981: aliándose con los comunistas quedó en mejor posición para debilitarlos más tarde. Profunda incertidumbre política En el futuro, el escenario más probable es la formación de un gabinete de minoría moderado que actúe como gobierno en funciones hasta el año entrante (el presidente no puede volver a disolver la Asamblea Nacional hasta junio del 2025 ). Pero con Macron a la defensiva y sin mayoría parlamentaria, Francia estará en territorio inexplorado. Las personalidades políticas concretas pesarán mucho más que los rótulos de “izquierda”, “derecha” o “centro”. Como en cualquier sistema político, algunos políticos franceses buscan la estabilidad y el acuerdo, y otros están obsesionados con aplastar a sus presuntos enemigos. De modo que el año entrante se caracterizará por una profunda incertidumbre política, que no contribuirá a mejorar el panorama económico de Francia. No obstante, pase lo que pase, el próximo gobierno tendrá que acordar el presupuesto para el 2025 en los próximos meses. Tal vez la nueva Asamblea Nacional logre hallar cierto acuerdo para una reforma electoral. El procedimiento actual con dos vueltas se adapta mejor a un sistema político bipolar, pero esta elección volvió a confirmar que ahora la política francesa es tripolar. En vista del surgimiento de tres bloques bien definidos (de izquierda, derecha y centro), la única solución es introducir la representación proporcional, donde cada partido establezca su nivel de apoyo y se formen coaliciones voluntarias una vez contados los votos. En la izquierda, por ejemplo, los socialistas no tendrían que atarse a Francia Insumisa para resultar elegidos, y podrían formar alianzas con otras fuerzas (por ejemplo, el partido de Macron) una vez llegados al Parlamento. La fragmentada política francesa no es tan diferente de las de otros países europeos. Pero Francia tiene una cultura política y unas instituciones únicas en el grado en que alientan la confrontación antes que la creación de coaliciones. ¿Llevará el resultado de esta elección a que los políticos franceses cambien la manera de pensar o todos seguirán actuando como siempre lo han hecho? Si sucede lo segundo, Agrupación Nacional solo tendrá que esperar el momento adecuado y capitalizar la ineficacia del gobierno, y tarde o temprano se alzará con el triunfo.

Y esa misma estrategia es la que Israel utiliza contra Gaza, en este caso dice atacando objetivos de Hamás, que coinciden con casas donde mueren bebés, con calles donde mueren niñas y niños que intentan sobrevivir y jugar entre el miedo y la metralla, con hospitales que buscan desesperadamente salvar vidas que se escapan, con parejas que eligen amarse a pesar del horror y con el corazón del que ya solo es hijo del polvo que mastica y le ahoga. Y a pesar de esas terribles coincidencias, Israel sigue machacando a una población indefensa, diciendo que contra lo que dispara son objetivos terroristas. De locos. Y el mundo lo observa y lo censura con palabras finas y escenifica una ayuda humanitaria que llega despacio y tarde y luego se olvida de todo porque el dinero manda donde la vida apenas vale unos cuantos dólares.\nDías atrás, en un informativo, decían cómo los colonos israelíes, organizados en cruceros , recorren la costa para ver cuál es la situación de la franja de Gaza a la que consideran tierra de Israel y que pronto podrán pisar y en la que podrán vivir. Y mientras el sueño se cumple desde el barco, graban los bombardeos que una noche más hostigan a la población palestina y rezan para que el alma olvide y la razón sea una tarde sin recuerdos. Solo así podrán perdonarse.\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo\nTEMAS",

    "text": "Meta Faces Backlash over Alleged Use of Pirated Books to Train AI tech Giant Accused of Ignoring Copyright Concerns in Pursuit of AI Advancement\nSan Francisco, CA – Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is embroiled in controversy after allegations surfaced that it used a massive library of pirated books to train its groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) models.A new court filing, part of an ongoing copyright infringement lawsuit, paints a troubling picture of Meta knowingly utilizing a trove of copyrighted material, known as LibGen, to fuel the development of its Llama AI.\nThe filing reveals internal concerns raised by Meta employees about the legality of using LibGen. Documents show that some within the company referred to LibGen as a “data set we know to be pirated” and warned that its use could jeopardize Meta’s standing with regulators.\nDespite these warnings, the filing alleges that Meta CEO mark Zuckerberg personally approved the use of LibGen for at least one Llama model. This decision, according to the lawsuit, was made despite the availability of alternative methods, such as hiring contractors to summarize books or acquiring rights from a major publisher.Adding to the controversy,the filing claims that Meta may have attempted to conceal its use of LibGen by stripping the data of attribution,further obscuring the source of the copyrighted material.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Meta used torrenting, a peer-to-peer file-sharing method, to download LibGen. This practice raised concerns among some Meta engineers, who questioned the legality of such an approach.However, the head of Meta’s generative AI division reportedly dismissed these concerns, paving the way for the company to proceed with torrenting LibGen.\nWhile the case is still ongoing and Meta maintains its right to fair use, the allegations have already drawn scrutiny. Judge Vince Chhabria, presiding over the case, rejected Meta’s request to redact portions of the filing, stating that the company’s primary motivation was to avoid negative publicity rather than protect sensitive business data.\nThis latest development casts a shadow over Meta’s AI ambitions, raising critical questions about the ethical boundaries of data acquisition in the race to develop cutting-edge technology.\nThe Ethical Dilemma of AI development The case against Meta highlights a growing debate surrounding the ethical implications of AI development. As companies race to create increasingly complex AI models,questions arise about the sources of training data and the potential for copyright infringement.\nThe use of pirated material, as alleged in this case, raises concerns about the exploitation of creative works and the potential harm to authors and publishers. It also raises questions about the transparency and accountability of AI development processes.\nThis controversy underscores the need for clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of copyrighted material in AI training. As AI technology continues to advance, it is indeed crucial to ensure that its development is conducted responsibly and ethically.\nMeta’s AI Controversy: Did They Use Pirated Books? Serena: Hey Alex,did you see that article about Meta using pirated books to train their AI?\nAlex: No way,seriously? What’s going on?\nSerena: Apparently,there’s a lawsuit against Meta. They’re accused of using a massive library of pirated books from a site called LibGen to train their AI, Llama.\nAlex: Using pirated books? That’s not cool. Isn’t that illegal?\nSerena: Absolutely. The lawsuit claims Meta knew thes books were pirated because their own employees flagged it. Some even called LibGen a “data set we know to be pirated.” It’s crazy that they would risk this.\nAlex: So, Mark Zuckerberg just signed off on using stolen books?\nSerena: Yep, that’s what the lawsuit alleges.It says Zuck himself approved the use of LibGen, even though there were other options, like hiring contractors to summarize books or getting rights from publishers.\nAlex: That sounds pretty shady. What’s Meta saying about all this?\nSerena: They’re claiming fair use, but it doesn’t look good. The judge even rejected their attempt to hide parts of the lawsuit,saying they were trying to avoid bad press.\nAlex: Wow,this is a huge deal. It raises some serious questions about ethics in AI advancement. Where do you think they draw the line?\nSerena: Exactly! If they can justify using stolen books, what else will they do in pursuit of better AI? It’s a slippery slope, and we need to make sure these powerful companies are held accountable.",

Las lluvias recientes también favorecieron el incremento en los niveles de 210 presas de México, que en conjunto son capaces de almacenar el 92 por ciento del agua de los embalses del país, se incrementó del 38 por ciento al 42 por ciento, de acuerdo al nivel observado el 15 de julio, con un volumen total de 52 mil 623 millones de metros cúbicos. Pese a las precipitaciones en plena temporada de huracanes, las temperaturas extremas no han cedido, pues del 8 al 14 de julio se registraron más de 47 grados Celsius en Baja California y Sonora, destacó la Conagua e hizo hincapié, el 8 de julio, cuando se superó el récord histórico, en Mexicali, al alcanzar los 52.4 grados, superando los 52 grados registrados el 28 de julio de 1995. En contraste, las temperaturas mínimas, menores a 5 grados se observaron en zonas puntuales de Durango, Estado de México y Puebla.
