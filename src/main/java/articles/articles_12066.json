    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nCher has filed for a conservatorship over her son Elijah Blue Allman . On Thursday, December 28th, People reported that the singer/actress filed to be the sole conservator of her son's estate due to alleged substance abuse issues. She claims that he is \"substantially unable to manage his financial resources.\"\nDocuments obtained by People revealed that while \"Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust,\" Cher \"is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.\" The filing added that a conservator is \"urgently needed ... to protect Elijah’s property from loss or injury\" as he is \"currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.\"\nElijah's estranged wife, Marieangela King was also mentioned in the filing to state that she is not fit to be his conservator as \"their tumultuous relationship has been marked by a cycle of drug addiction and mental health crises.\"\nAccording to People , a hearing for a temporary order is set for January 5th, 2024 and a hearing for a permanent order will take place on March 6th.\nEarlier this year, Cher addressed a report that she hired four men to forcibly remove Elijah from a New York City hotel room in November 2022, which resurfaced from King's divorce documents she filed last December. Cher later addressed the allegations telling People , \"that rumor is not true.\"",

    "title": "Donald Trump, for all his flaws, made Israel’s triumph over Hamas much more likely",
    "text": "President Donald Trump with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Bahrain Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani and UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan for the signing of the Abraham Accords at the White House on Sept. 15, 2020. Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images\nIsrael’s army chief and prime minister made clear this week that Israel has only one New Year’s Resolution on the table: destroying Hamas.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that the ongoing operation in Gaza was “not close” to over.\nTragic as this just war is, it’s a bit of a miracle that Israel can wage it for so long. And that traces back to Donald Trump.\nGiven his utter lack of diplomatic finesse, ex-President Trump never had the look of an international peacemaker, let alone one who’d do wonders for Jews.\nThose of us observing from Canada or across other allied nations could never have predicted it, but it turns out the Abraham Accords negotiated under Trump have made Israel’s continued existence and gradual triumph in this new war dramatically more likely.\nRecall that in 2016 the new Republican administration inherited a stagnant Middle East peace scenario.\nSince Israel’s founding, the conflict has essentially been the story of a democratic Israel ring-fenced by antagonistic Arab states who feigned empathy for Palestinians while using them as a tool to undermine Israel’s legitimacy.\nThese states even refused to recognize Israel’s right to exist.\nWith the leadership of senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Trump White House tried a new “outside-in” approach to Mideast peace.\nThe Abraham Accords are proving to be a singular diplomatic triumph for the United States, and a godsend for Israel.\nIn August 2020, they provided for a gradual normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.\nThey also ignited rapid improvements in strategically significant relationships between Israel and Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia — all at one time adversaries of the Jewish state.\nAs a result, they did more than any other presidential initiative to ensure that 2023 is not a replica of the 1967 war, when Israel was attacked on multiple fronts not merely by proxy terror groups like modern day Hamas or Hezbollah, but by a coalition of recognized Arab states.\nToday, with the Accords in place, there’s simply too much for all sides to lose in an expansive conflict — like the 4 million new jobs and $1 trillion in new investment on the table if the accords are fully leveraged through 2030, per the Hoover Institute.\nMilitarily, the Accords and ensuing normalization of relations have given Israel the geopolitical space it needs to prosecute a large-scale operation to crush Hamas without a greater risk of inter-state conflict.\nA long campaign and rising civilian death toll in Gaza may test the strength of the pacts, given strong sympathies with Palestinians in the Arab street, but, according to sources in the region, most actors seem open to continued normalization after Israel’s major campaign ends.\nIn fact, in a sad twist of irony, it looks like the Biden administration — not the Arab states living cheek-by-jowl next to Israel — is the biggest risk to Jerusalem’s ability to prosecute its just war for as long as it takes.\nBiden’s secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, told Bibi on Nov. 30 that Israel doesn’t “have the credit” for a months-long war that reaches into southern Gaza.\nIt’s unclear whether Blinken was referring to global goodwill or the willingness of the United States to support such operations, but it ultimately doesn’t matter.\nBlinken’s comments are a clear signal that, under President Biden, the United States will help Israel kill some terrorists, but maybe not all of them, lest it get awkward for onlookers.\nThis is a ridiculous proposition when it’s so evident Hamas must be crushed for both Israelis and innocent Palestinians to have a shot at peace.\nThe gradual withdrawal of US support for Israel’s just war against Hamas, sadly echoed in Canada, stands in stark contrast with the relative silence on the part of the Arab states.\nBefore the Abraham Accords, there would’ve been antisemitic rhetoric and potentially lethal interference from these states.\nTheir relative restraint — rhetorically, diplomatically and militarily — in the current conflict is breathtaking and novel in modern Mideast history.\nCanada’s foreign minister, Melanie Joly, recently articulated a vision anchored in “pragmatic diplomacy,” which boils down to engaging with enemies as well as allies, with the great risk of confusing them for one another.\nIn contrast, by focusing on making good business deals between states, Team Trump showed what real pragmatic diplomacy means — and the massive strategic benefit it can yield for the West’s democratic friends and allies.\nMatthew Bondy is a senior fellow with the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.",

    "text": "La Gendarmería Nacional allanó este jueves diferentes domicilios en la ciudad de Villa María en el marco de una investigación por presunta evasión tributaria que tiene en la mira al Grupo Fonte, según indicaron fuentes judiciales. El caso se inició meses atrás, cuando la fiscal federal María Schianni detectó supuestas maniobras fiscales que habrían dado lugar a una evasión tributaria. Si bien a la causa judicial la lleva Schianni, también participa la Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (Afip) de Río Cuarto. Los allanamientos contaron con la participación de veedores del Colegio de Escribanos y del Colegio de Contadores, además de personal de Afip y de integrantes de la fiscalía. Schianni confirmó a La Voz que la causa se desarrolla “sobre delitos tributarios que se investigan en relación al Grupo Fonte” y que los procedimientos respondieron al objeto de “recabar información y prueba que documente las maniobras”. “Son en torno a la actividad en general del grupo empresario”, agregó la fiscal. Del estudio de las pruebas y el avance de la investigación se desprenderá sobre qué inmuebles se habrían llevado a cabo las supuestas acciones de evasión. Los allanamientos De manera simultánea se realizaron allanamientos en oficinas de la conocida firma constructora e inmobiliaria y en domicilios de los investigados. También se ejecutaron en un estudio contable, en uno de arquitectura y en una escribanía en la que se realizaban los registros de las unidades habitacionales que Grupo Fonte comercializaba. No hubo detenidos, según se indicó, ya que los procedimientos eran a fines de recopilar información pertinente a la investigación. Entre otras acciones, se procedió al secuestro de algunos vehículos que eran utilizados por los investigados. Además, se realizaron allanamientos en oficinas comerciales que la firma tiene en Villa Carlos Paz.",

    "text": "Thursday, March 14th 2024, 4:32 pm 75 Tulsans can now call themselves American citizens after the naturalization ceremony on Thursday morning. Since 2019, these ceremonies have been hosted in City Hall and even the Admiral Twin during the pandemic, but Thursday’s was held here at the Cox Business Center and welcomed oath-takers from all over the world. It was a day of celebration for Tulsans from 42 countries, all here for the moment many have been waiting for years to experience. \"After 7 years I finally have my citizenship,\" says Diego Wasdin. Wasdin came to Tulsa from Mexico to follow his dream of getting a college degree and becoming an American, celebrating as he walked across the stage with his certificate in hand. \"Oh it's a great great feeling,\" says Wasdin. This year Tulsa welcomed people from 7 countries never represented before at this ceremony, like Belarus and Chile. \"We call these the happiest places in Tulsa,\" says Krystal Reyes with the city of Tulsa. She says this event allows freshly minted Americans to fully embrace their city. \"We've been doing these for several years and it's just part of our efforts to make sure we're being an inclusive and welcoming city for our immigrant and refugee communities,\" says Reyes. For Diego, the long journey to citizenship was tough but made easier by a strong support group. \"I have this family here and it's great they've always been there for me and they've been a huge help and thanks to them I’m here,\" says Wasdin. He says while much of his family is still in Mexico, these friends helped him reach his goal. \"I wanted to be a citizen that's one of my dreams ... and I never gave up working towards that citizenship,\" says Wasdin. As soon as they left the ceremony citizens were able to exercise one of their new rights by registering to vote.

(WNDU) - The bird flu has been spreading across the country, and now it’s made it way to Michiana.\nAccording to Purdue Extension, a case was confirmed at a commercial breeder duck facility in Elkhart County earlier this week.\nKathryn Jennings, a Purdue livestock educator, joined us on WNDU 16 News Now at 4 to give us more perspective on how big of a deal this is and tell us what farmers can do to protect themselves. You can learn more by watching the video above.\nBiosecurity Measures for Farms\n- Ensure proper disinfection of equipment on dairy farms.\n- Milk sick or quarantined cows last and isolate them from the rest of the herd.\n- Prevent cross-contamination by cleaning equipment and boots between uses and managing farm equipment movement.\n- Quarantine new cattle for at least 30 days before introducing them to the herd.\n- Keep different species separate when possible, as HPAI can affect both poultry and cattle.\n- Limit access of wild birds to livestock buildings.\n- Monitor animals for symptoms such as reduced milk production, fever, lethargy, and discolored milk.\n- Farm workers handling animals suspected of or confirmed to have HPAI should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), which includes disposable boots and gloves, safety goggles or face shields, NIOSH-approved respirators, disposable coveralls and head covers\n- Be sure to wash hands before and after using PPE.\nCopyright 2025 WNDU.

Nueva York se viste de blanco con la primera nevada en casi dos años Habían transcurrido 701 días desde que la nieve no llegaba a cuajar en Nueva York, y eran muchos los que hoy admiraban los paisajes blancos de la Gran Manzana Grandes partes de Nueva York, con su famoso Central Park a la cabeza, se vistieron de blanco con la primera nevada en cerca de dos años, que no fue muy copiosa pero aportó algunas estampas que los neoyorquinos y visitantes no veían desde 2022, tras un invierno pasado inusualmente suave. Habían transcurrido 701 días desde que la nieve no llegaba a cuajar en Nueva York, y eran muchos los que hoy admiraban los paisajes blancos de la Gran Manzana. El Central Park Central amaneció este martes con 3,55 centímetros de nieve, que visitantes y residentes aprovecharon para dar un paseo, tomar fotos y hacer videos. No faltaron los muñecos de nieve ni los valientes que ni siquiera hoy renunciaron a su 'footing' (trote) entre los senderos nevados del parque. Se espera que al final del día la zona haya acumulada otra pulgada y hasta tres en otras áreas de la ciudad El 13 de febrero de 2022 fue la última vez en que se acumuló la nieve, alcanzando 4,06 centímetros. El récord anterior de falta de nieve significativa en la ciudad fue de 400 días y terminó el 21 de marzo de 1998, por lo que los 700 días transcurridos en esta ocasión son ya historia de la ciudad. Otras zonas de Nueva York, en Long Island, al oeste de Manhattan, llegaron a acumular entre 5,08 y 6,35 centímetros, mientras está vigente una advertencia de tormenta invernal hasta esta noche. El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional estadounidense (NWS, en inglés) había advertido que las intensas nevadas y lluvias que desde la semana pasada afectan al Medio Oeste y a la región de los Grandes Lagos se extenderían al sur de Estados Unidos y a la costa este del país, impactando en ciudades como Nueva York, Washington y Filadelfia. Las temperaturas gélidas y peligrosas continúan para gran parte del país.",

    "text": "Argus Website\nWelcome, Guest\n| Log In\nWashington, 28 December (Argus) — The US, France, Germany and UK are urging Iran to immediately \"de-escalate\" its nuclear program in response to a UN report that alleges Tehran increased its production of near-weapons grade uranium.\nIran has recently tripled production of uranium enriched up to 60pc at its Natanz and Fordow enrichment plants, compared to production levels in the first half of 2023, the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report to its members on 26 December. IAEA inspectors measured production at the plants earlier this month.\nThe US, UK, France and Germany said they condemned Tehran for the increased production of highly enriched uranium, which they said had no credible civilian use and carries \"significant\" nuclear proliferation risks. The four countries were among the initial signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, although the US withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018.\n\"These decisions demonstrate Iran's lack of good will towards de-escalation and represent reckless behavior in a tense regional context,\" the US, France, Germany and UK said in a joint statement today. \"We remain committed to a diplomatic solution and reaffirm our determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon.\"\nIranian officials have denied the reports of increased production of highly enriched uranium. Atomic Energy Organization of Iran head Mohammad Eslami dismissed the claims as \"media hype\" meant to distract from Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to Iranian media.\nRegional tensions have increased since Gaza-based group Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. Earlier today, the US imposed sanctions on exchange houses in Yemen and Turkey it said were facilitating the transfer of \"millions of dollars\" in Iranian funds to Houthi militants in Yemen that have claimed responsibility for attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps separately said on Wednesday it would seek \"revenge\" against Israel for an air strike that killed one of its senior officers in Syria.\nBy Chris Knight\nSend comments and request more information at\nCopyright © 2023.

    "title": "Медицинская тема стала одной из главных на сессии ЗС - МК Иркутск",
    "text": "Один из принятых законопроектов внес губернатор Иркутской области Игорь Кобзев. Это проект закона о снижении квалификационных требований для участников СВО при поступлении на муниципальную службу. Эти кандидаты могут претендовать на замещение вакантных должностей на муниципальной службе с опытом работы по специальности от года (для других – от двух лет). Также законопроект предполагает снижение требований к образованию для этой категории соискателей. Депутаты приняли закон сразу в двух чтениях.\n«В настоящее время стоят задачи не только по социализации, адаптации, переквалификации участников СВО, но и по привлечению, как говорит наш президент, этих проверенных, настоящих парней на муниципальную службу. Сейчас они могут на новых условиях участвовать в конкурсах на замещение вакантных должностей в муниципальных образованиях. Безусловно депутаты поддерживают инициативы губернатора, направленные на поддержку семей участников СВО и самих ребят, возвращающихся к гражданской жизни», – подчеркнул Александр Ведерников.\nЕще один важный законопроект, внесенный депутатам на рассмотрение, – это изменения в закон о единовременной денежной выплате для медицинских работников, которые переезжают на работу в города с населением до 50 тысяч человек или от 50 до 100 тысяч в районы, приравненные к Крайнему Северу. Ранее единовременную выплату могли получить только те, кто переезжает в другой город и не имеет там прописки. Теперь выплату распространят также на тех, кто родился в таких городах и поехал учиться на врача или медсестру. Такие молодые специалисты при возвращении в родной город или поселок смогут рассчитывать на те же выплаты, что и участники программ «Земский доктор» и «Земский фельдшер». Второе изменение в закон о выплатах медикам заключается в том, что теперь выплата сохраняется за теми медработниками, которые перешли на другую должность в том же медучреждении или в другое медучреждение в том же населенном пункте.\nБыл принят закон об увеличении числа граждан, которым присваивается звание «Заслуженный донор». После введения в действие закона ежегодно это звание будут получать 10 человек (до принятия закона – пять).\nТакже депутаты приняли закон об административной ответственности за содержание домашних и безнадзорных животных. Наказания за его нарушения – от предупреждения до штрафа в 15 тысяч рублей.\nНа правительственном часе в рамках сессии народные избранники рассмотрели вопрос помощи онкологическим больным. К сожалению, Иркутская область относится к неблагоприятным по онкологии регионам. Резко-континентальный климат снижает иммунитет, радиационный фон увеличивает риски, а малоподвижный образ жизни и вредные привычки усиливают негативные факторы. Ранее все больные, у которых подозревали онкологию, должны были ехать на обследование в Иркутск, Ангарск или Братск, ожидая своей очереди месяцами. Для того чтобы изменить ситуацию, увеличить число случаев выявления онкозаболеваний на самых ранних стадиях, в Приангарье создали сеть центров амбулаторной онкологической помощи. Всего их 17.\nПо задумке в ЦАОП пациенты могут получить консультацию, им поставят диагноз, проведут обследование, назначат и проведут лечение, откорректируют терапию, назначат и проведут реабилитацию. ЦАОП работают уже четыре года, и министр здравоохранения Приангарья Андрей Модестов в своем докладе показал на выявленные за это время недостатки. Первый – это недостаточность медицинских кадров. Для ЦАОП важны медицинские работники, специализирующиеся на диагностировании и лечении онкологии. Таких медиков мало, особенно в отдаленных территориях. Второй недостаток – это оборудование, точнее, его недостаточность. В 2018 году на оснащение этих центров было направлено 300 миллионов рублей из федерального бюджета. Однако ЦАОП еще не были созданы, и деньги пошли на закупку диагностического оборудования для областного онкоцентра. Сейчас ЦАОП на местах пользуются оборудованием, которые есть в больницах, но оно уже устарело, часто ломается или изношено на 100 %. И третий – также недостаточное финансирование лекарственного обеспечения.\nПо итогам правительственного часа депутаты постановили изучить опыт работы ЦАОП в соседних регионах, после чего собраться и решить, как увеличить финансирование этих центров и улучшить обеспеченность их медицинскими кадрами, в том числе привлекать людей на работу в ЦАОП, предоставляя им жилье, отправлять учиться по целевому набору или создавать вакансии, подходящие под программы «Земский доктор» или «Земский фельдшер».",
