    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "'Slowdown Fears & AI Shift Hit Hiring, But...': IIM Sambalpur Director On Drop In Placements\nIIM Sambalpur has recently integrated AI into classroom learning.\nWith management education evolving rapidly, IIM Sambalpur is at the forefront of innovation—bringing AI into classrooms, reshaping student engagement, and preparing future leaders for a tech-driven world. But how does this transformation impact learning outcomes? In an exclusive conversation with News18.com, IIM Sambalpur Director Prof. Mahadeo Jaiswal shares insights on the institute’s AI-powered classrooms. He also shared the institute’s placement roadmap amid a shifting job market and the steps being taken to position IIM Sambalpur among the country’s top business schools.\nQ. IIM Sambalpur has recently integrated AI into classroom learning. How has this transformation impacted student engagement and discussions, and what measurable improvements have you observed in learning outcomes?\nrelated stories\nMahadeo Jaiswal: The incorporation of AI in classroom learning at IIM Sambalpur has majorly transformed student engagement and participation in the academics. The AI-driven learning model allows students to come prepared for discussions and strengthens both individual and group interactions, this also ensures that students are prepared in advance for deeper discussions in the classroom by providing pre-class material such as case studies, articles, and videos. The conduct of real-time quizzes and evaluations by AI ensures that every student remains engaged and accountable in the class discussions. It is making the learning process more interactive and dynamic for every individual.\nThis shift from traditional classes to AI-driven classes has led to higher-quality participation and a more structured learning environment for the students. Also, instant feedback shows a noticeable improvement in student’s preparation, with more precise and objective assessment of their contribution during class discussions. This has led to more accurate and meaningful outcomes, mainly in terms of analysis and application. It is shift from traditional teacher centric teaching to student centric learning.\nQ. While student feedback on AI-based learning has been largely positive, the institute report highlights some challenges, such as technical difficulties. What measures are being taken to enhance the AI-driven learning experience and ensure its seamless adoption across courses?\nMahadeo Jaiswal: Though the feedback from the students regarding the AI-driven learning model has been enthusiastically positive, we also acknowledge that there have been initial technical challenges, mainly in terms of system integration and content structuring. To ensure a smooth adoption of AI across all courses, we are investing in strong technical infrastructure and continuous training sessions for both faculty members and students.\nOur faculty members have been trained to adapt the new AI system to suit specific course needs. We are also gradually incorporating AI into the curriculum, starting with a few sessions in each course. Also, our dedicated technical support team is keenly monitoring the system promptly to resolve any glitches. Because of the economics of scale, we anticipate that the cost per session will decrease as the system develops, which will help a seamless learning experience for the students.\nQ. IIM Sambalpur was ranked 50th among management institutions in India by the NIRF 2024. What strategic initiatives are you implementing to enhance the institute’s ranking and position it among the top IIMs?\nMahadeo Jaiswal: We at IIM Sambalpur believe in strengthening our national and international stature through a multi-dimensional, strategic approach. While NIRF rankings place more importance on publication in research, overall our interest is to secure elite global accreditations like AACSB, as in line with our vision of providing world-class education.\nOne of the foundations of our strategy is how we incorporated Artificial Intelligence (AI) into teaching methodologies. Not only does this technology equip our students with relevant skills for the future, making them more employable and placement-ready, but it also gives our teachers more time to carry out high-impact research. By promoting a culture of scholarship, we also aspire to greatly improve our research productivity and international academic collaborations.\nWe are also placing high emphasis on faculty development, infrastructure upgradation, and innovative programs such as AI-based learning models to make us stand apart from other IIMs. Moreover, our focus on quality placements ensures a robust industry connection, which is as valuable for recruiters as for students. In the long run, we aim to not only enhance rankings but also position IIM Sambalpur as a world-class institution of excellence in learning, research, and innovation.\nQ. Could you highlight some of the flagship courses offered by IIM Sambalpur and the admission process for these programs?\nMahadeo Jaiswal: At IIM Sambalpur, we offer a diverse range of flagship courses, which include the “MBA\" with specialized electives in fields such as Marketing, Finance, Operations and Strategy. Also, we have recently launched a new flagship programme, that is “MBA in Business Analytics\". These courses are designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of management concepts and parallelly practical skills to excel in today’s dynamic business environment.\nOur admission process follows a rigorous multi-stage selection procedure, including CAT (Common Admission Test) scores, GD (Group Discussion), PI (Personal Interview Rounds). Candidates with appropriate job experience, high academic credentials, and proven leadership potential are given preference. Also, we strongly value diversity and encourage applications from students with excellent professional and academic backgrounds.\nQ. In 2023, IIM Sambalpur’s highest package was Rs 64.61 LPA at Microsoft, whereas in 2024, it dropped to Rs 23.50 LPA. What factors contributed to this decline, and what steps are being taken to enhance placement opportunities in the coming years?\nMahadeo Jaiswal: The decline in the highest placement package in 2024 shows the wider global economic SLOWDOWN, not just in IIMs or IITs but the whole world, with various reasons including the recessions in major economies and the development of AI technologies affecting the recruiting environment in the job market. Although this is a temporary setback, we are committed to expanding our placement opportunities across different industries, including technology, finance, consulting, and entrepreneurship.\nQ. What makes an MBA application successful? please share some tips for aspirants.\nMahadeo Jaiswal: A successful MBA application includes academic performance, professional experiences, and personal qualities. It is important for candidates to show that they have a clear and precise understanding of their career goals and how an MBA degree will help them achieve those professional objectives. Additionally, strong leadership quality is highly valued, whether by showcasing in extracurricular activities or in professional accomplishments. Also, candidates should be able to effectively convey their ideas and should also have a strong understanding of the current industry trends.\nThey should also have a good command over their communication skills. We advise candidates to concentrate on creating a versatile profile that showcases their goals and strong points, in addition to being genuine in their personal statements and interviews. With that, preparing thoroughly for CAT and demonstrating consistent academic performance will create a competitive application.\n- Location :\n- First Published:\nNews\neducation-career'Slowdown Fears & AI Shift Hit Hiring, But...': IIM Sambalpur Director On Drop In Placements",

    "text": "Athletes such as Muhammad Ali, Tommy Smith and Colin Kaepernick have used their platform to advance political causes. As we talk about self-determination and closing the racial wealth gap, what would it mean for today’s millionaires and billionaires such as Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Magic Johnson, Tyler Perry, Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z, Robert Smith, David Steward, Rihanna, among others to use their money, power and influence to create modern Black Wall Streets across America?\nJaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics is one of the first to have brought up the idea of creating a modern-day Black Wall Street. What would that look like? The Black Wall Street in Tulsa Oklahoma’s Greenwood District was one of the most prosperous African American communities in the United States. America had over 100 such communities and many more Freedom Colonies. There are enough resources in the Black community for the manifestation of a Black Wall Street. A modern day Black Wall Street would probably be a hybrid of a physical site and a virtual one.\nNow is the ideal time to brainstorm and envision what physical and virtual Black Wall Streets would look like. We have more resources and are in a much better position than our ancestors who built the prior wall streets. With a vision, we can do it and although not necessary, our allies will join us.\nAccording to a presentation by Katz Multicultural, Black American buying power has increased 48% from 2010 to 2019, with an estimated growth to $1.8 trillion by 2024. According to Nicole Kenney, an NAACP economic program specialist, only 2 cents of every dollar an African American spends in this country goes to Black-owned businesses. Jeffrey L. Boney wrote an article in 2014 titled, “From Black Wall Street to the Black Dollar Project.” He reports that the Black dollar stays in the Black community for less than six hours. Maggie Anderson’s book, “Our Black Year: One Family’s Quest to Buy Black in America’s Racially Divided Economy” explains how difficult it is to buy Black.\nSome believe the creation of a Black Wall Street or streets is the solution. Every community over a certain size should commit to having its own Black Wall Street. In the local communities, there would be hair care, bars, restaurants, and other types of goods and services that cater to Black audiences. These might be business districts that consisted of business condos or co-ops where the business would not have to fear being displaced because of rising rents and gentrification. Business directories and the local Black business scene would be for people to spend as much of their dollars with Black-owned businesses\nIn a tech world, a Black Wall Street might look like buildings of incubators, accelerators and shared workspaces creating the STEM-based business of the future in tech, life sciences, clean tech and built by knowledge workers in advanced manufacturing plants earning six figure salaries – typical for chip manufacturers.\nA Black Wall Street would provide education, mentorship, and the pathway to turn an idea, invention, hobby, side hustle or gig work into a business or franchise. Many people have gone from a hobby to flea market to kiosk(s) to storefront(s) or online business to scale.\nSince health is wealth, a Black Wall Street would offer fresh produce, healthy eating options, opportunities for exercise and relaxation such as prayer, meditation, and yoga, and access to primary care.\nBlack wealth would need to include Black experiences in all aspects of the arts, from our children learning everything from the viola to common African instruments to professional ballet dancers. Black public art would thrive, as well as galleries exhibiting emerging and established talents.\nThere would be the ability to learn about Black history and not have to be apologetic about it.\nA Black Wall Street(s) would have to address the barrier of access to capital which has plagued Black businesses since slavery. Black asset management firms manage only 1.1% of the total $71.4 trillion in assets. Less than 1% of all venture dollars go to startups founded by Black entrepreneurs. As long as there is discrimination in the credit process, there will be the need for a banks. However, a modern Black Wall Street would have to go beyond Black banks and insurance companies, and include opportunities in every asset class from crowdsourcing, private equity, and venture capital to REITS. There are already well-known examples such as Jay-Z and Serena Williams who have venture funds with missions to help Blacks.\nIn the history of Black thought from Marcus Garvey to Booker T. Washington to Malcolm X, to President Barack Obama, there are consistent themes of Black empowerment and self-efficacy, Black excellence, and Black pride. A Black Wall Street would be a manifestation of those themes and the principles of Kwanzaa brought to life. Black Jews, Christians, Muslims, and others have their faith traditions from which to draw principles and values for a successful, joyous life and not just a wealthy one.\nA virtual “Black Wall Street” could encompass several key elements:\nEconomic Empowerment Platforms: Online platforms designed to support Black-owned businesses by providing resources such as funding opportunities, mentorship programs, and access to markets.\nDigital Marketplace: A centralized digital marketplace specifically for Black entrepreneurs to showcase and sell their products and services. This platform could facilitate direct consumer engagement and foster a supportive community, crowd-sourcing opportunities, and would be a marketplace where those who had money to invest could meet those who had investment opportunities.\nEducational Resources: Virtual workshops, webinars, and courses tailored to the needs of Black entrepreneurs, covering topics from business planning and marketing to financial literacy and digital skills.\nNetworking and Collaboration: Virtual networking events and forums where Black business owners can connect, collaborate on projects, share experiences, and support each other’s growth.\nCultural Celebration and Awareness: Incorporating elements of Black culture, history, and identity into the platform to celebrate achievements, promote awareness, and foster a sense of community pride.\nPolicy and Advocacy: Virtual advocacy initiatives aimed at addressing systemic barriers and advocating for policies that support Black entrepreneurship and economic empowerment.\nInvestment and Funding: Virtual pitch events, crowdfunding platforms, and investment networks focused on supporting Black businesses, helping them access capital to scale their ventures.\nEd Gaskin is Executive Director of Greater Grove Hall Main Streets and founder of Sunday Celebrations.",
