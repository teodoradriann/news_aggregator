    "title": "В Бурятии полыхает более 10 тысяч гектаров леса - МК Улан-Удэ",
    "text": "За последние сутки в лесах Бурятии зафиксировано 12 новых очагов возгорания. Пожары вспыхнули сразу в восьми районах республики – Баргузинском, Баунтовском, Бичурском, Джидинском, Еравнинском, Заиграевском, Кабанском и Кяхтинском. По предварительным данным, причиной всех инцидентов стало банальное несоблюдение правил пожарной безопасности, сообщили в Республиканском агентстве лесного хозяйства (РАЛХ).\nМасштабы огненной стихии с начала пожароопасного сезона скрываются.\nНа утро 8 мая ситуация остаётся напряжённой: несмотря на ликвидацию восьми очагов, в четырёх районах продолжают бушевать 21 активный пожар. Огнём уже охвачено более 10,5 тысяч гектаров лесного фонда. К счастью, угрозы населённым пунктам нет – все возгорания характеризуются как низкоинтенсивные.\nНа передовой огненного фронта сейчас работают 388 человек – сотрудники лесной охраны, авиалесоохраны, МЧС и волонтёры. В операции задействовано 92 единицы спецтехники. Особую тревогу вызывает Баунтовский район, где из-за масштабов бедствия введён режим ЧС.\nВласти напоминают: на всей территории республики действует особый противопожарный режим. Посещение лесов временно ограничено, а любые работы с открытым огнём строго запрещены. При обнаружении возгораний следует немедленно звонить на горячую линию лесной охраны по номеру 20-44-44.\nСпециалисты призывают жителей и гостей Бурятии проявлять максимальную ответственность – человеческая беспечность остаётся главной причиной природных катастроф. В условиях аномально жаркой весенней погоды даже непотушенная сигарета может привести к необратимым последствиям.",

    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Louisville's transitional outdoor space helping connect the city's homeless population with resources is now planning to start charging the people who live there. The Hope Village opened in 2022 off East College Street, a community helping connect people with outreach resources and housing. [The Hope Buss](https://www.thehopebuss.org/) operates Hope Village, providing access to food, personal items and other resources. Last summer, the village replaced the blue tents with small pods. About 50 kiosks, donated by CVS, now provide a more stable shelter for residents. Each pod has a cot, air conditioning, heating, electricity and other features. \"These are not homeless, helpless people,\" said Stachelle Bussey, executive director of the Hope Buss. \"They have an address. They have a residence.\" In the latest change, those living at Hope Village will now be paying to do so. Bussey said the cost is $75 per week, adding up to about $300 per month. \"One of the things that is obvious around the facts is that as city things change, as funding has been allocated different places, that things change around here,\" Bussey said. Greg Donley, a Hope Village resident, said he doesn't mind the new cost. Donley said hard times and medical bills left him homeless. Before he arrived at the Hope Village, he was sleeping on a ledge over Breckinridge Street. \"I've lived here a year, and my rent has been zero,\" he said Thursday. \"So if I have to start paying rent after a year, I appreciate the year of not paying rent.\" Bussey is not calling the fee \"rent\" but rather a \"service occupancy fee.\" Donley has been part of the workforce program through various partnerships helping connect people with work. According to Bussey, 60% of the current residents at Hope Village are working. \"One partner we have, it pays $15 an hour,\" Bussey said. Donley said having to start paying some for everything he's gotten at Hope Village is just part of the progression to his next step. \"When I go get my own apartment, I've got to pay my own bills,\" he said. \"And if I don't get use to doing it, I'm gonna walk out that door and it's gonna hit me like a wall. And then I might be back sleeping on a wall.\" He said his goal is to get back the life he once had. \"I'm trying to transition to the life I had before, which was paying rent, paying bills, paying water,\" Donley said. \"You don't realize that until you become homeless. And then you miss it. And you miss the responsibility.\" Bussey said the conversations surrounding the fee have included Hope Village staff and residents. \"We talk about 'Do we believe in the work? Do we believe in the program? Or do we just need to kind of close it?'\" she said. \"And it was a consensus of we all wanted to keep it open because we all believe in the work, and Hope Village is needed.\" Donley said if he needs a shirt for an interview, it's provided. So are rides, hygiene items and more. And he hopes to move on soon. \"I wanna leave this pod better than I found it for the next person who needs it,\" he said.

    "text": "Stephen Curry recently signed a one-year extension with the Golden State Warriors worth $62.6 million, which will keep him in the Bay Area through the 2026-27 season. That extension had NBA fans bringing up the most loyal players in NBA history. And any time loyalty is discussed, Dirk Nowitzki must be mentioned. Towards the end of the German's career, The Business Insider published an article showcasing how much money Dirk Nowitzki sacrificed by taking less money and not signing the max extension on every contract, something he very easily could've asked for and likely been given for his impact on the franchise. According to a table in that article, which has resurfaced from the Curry extension, Nowitzki left more than $194 million on the table in order for the Mavs to try and lure in better talent around him. READ MORE: Kings Starter Calls Mavs' Kyrie Irving 'Toughest to Guard' While Nowitzki left money on the table, the Dallas Mavericks swung and missed on a lot of their top targets. From Dwight Howard , LeBron James , Deron Williams, DeAndre Jordan (the first time), Carmelo Anthony, and more, it often left Dallas with players such as Monta Ellis, Chandler Parsons, Samuel Dalembert, etc. Some of their \"Plan Bs\" ended up working out but they weren't the stars Nowitzki could've won another championship with. Nowitzki spent all 21 years with the Mavericks, the most any player has ever played with one franchise. Kobe Bryant and Udonis Haslem spent 20 years with their respective franchises followed by John Stockton's and Tim Duncan's 19 years with theirs. Dirk Nowitzki means as much to the Mavericks as any player ever has for a team. He brought the team their first MVP and championship, becoming the NBA's 6th all-time scorer. His identity with the Mavericks is as synonymous as Larry Bird is with the Boston Celtics or as Bryant with the Lakers, but both of those organizations have had dozens of other superstars wear their jerseys and win championships.

    "text": "Get Ready to Rally for a Cause: The ‘Dakar for Life’ Project! Ah, Tenerife! The postcard-perfect paradise where the sun shines brighter than your cousin at a family BBQ who just discovered Instagram filters. Now, hold on to your sun hats because there’s something far more serious on your horizon: the ‘Dakar for Life’ initiative! While everyone’s out trying to get the best tan on the beach, one brave truck is out there mixing sport and social responsibility like a blender gone rogue. Let’s dive in!\nPainting the Town Pink (and Actually Doing Something About It) So here’s the scoop: the Cabildo of Tenerife, through their public company Ideco, is leaping into action with a project that’s more vibrant than a flamingo at a paintball contest! The ‘Dakar for Life’ is all about raising awareness about breast cancer—yes, the kind that doesn’t just touch women; it sometimes has a cheeky little run-in with men too. And no, we’re not talking about those awkward moments at family gatherings; we’re talking about a serious health issue that often gets overshadowed.\nThe pink-painted truck, auspiciously dubbed the ‘Pink Elephant’, is revving up to head to the Dakar 2025, but not before it makes a stop in the Plaza del Cabildo to show off its army-issue pink. Rafael Lesmes, the Canarian athlete at the wheel, said the entire team is honored—I mean, who wouldn’t be honored to drive the world’s most conspicuous truck?\nThe Big Names Bringing Pink Power This event featured a roster of players that might make a reality TV show star blush! You had Vice President Lope Afonso, who was practically bouncing off the walls with excitement about the Cabildo’s commitment. Let’s be honest, it’s a tough job being a vice president when your main task is to convince people that turning everything pink is a legitimate cause.\nThen there was Sports Minister Yolanda Moliné, who pointed out that sport isn’t just about sweating it out and chasing medals but also about being a social champion. Thank you, Yolanda! We were beginning to think that athletes were only born with two legs and a competitive streak.\nMeanwhile, Águeda Fumero was busy praising the collaboration with the ‘Carrera por la Vida’ Foundation, sounding like she’d just found out there was more than one flavor of ice cream. I mean, who doesn’t love a good community effort? It’s like a neighborhood potluck, except the only thing anyone’s bringing is awareness and support, because, let’s face it, Aunt Mabel’s mystery casserole is a threat to health in its own right!\nAll About Awareness—With a Dash of Humor! Rafael Lesmes made it clear he’s buzzed to be carrying this serious message to new heights. “It’s all for the patients and the volunteers!” he was quoted, likely adjusting his pink shades while strutting through the Plaza. Because nothing says “let’s combat cancer” like a well-decorated truck and a sprinkling of grit. But let’s not forget: raising awareness about breast cancer is paramount. 2% of men get it—yeah, that’s a thing that most folks disregard like an old menu in a fast-food joint. Remember, men, it’s not just a woman’s fight!\nThe Numbers Don’t Lie! Here’s where it gets really impressive: The ‘Dakar for Life’ message has crossed borders like a soccer ball at the World Cup—27 countries and an audience that’s impacted over 751,714 times! This thing is spreading awareness faster than a rumor in a small town. It’s no wonder that we’re seeing a 72% increase in outreach compared to their first shindig. And if that doesn’t sound like a success, folks, I don’t know what does!\nClosing Remarks: Be Like Pink Elephant So as we rally behind this spirited project, let’s remember: awareness isn’t about wearing pink for a day, it’s about showing up for the long haul! The ‘Dakar for Life’ is encouraging us to tackle the realities of breast cancer for everyone involved. And hey, even if you’re not a fan of motorsport (or pink), you can sit back, support the cause, and enjoy the spectacle of a giant pink truck blazing across the desert—because nothing screams social justice like a herd of elephants charging down a path of advocacy!\nGet ready, world, because that ‘Pink Elephant’ is coming to a racetrack near you—or at the very least, a social media feed. Keep your eyes peeled and your hearts open!\nNote : This reworked article mixes humor, observations, and a cheeky touch, emphasizing the importance of awareness while engaging readers in a lively manner. The HTML structure and internal headings help create a clear, engaging experience for the reader.\nSANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE 7 Nov. (EUROPA PRESS) –\nThe Cabildo of Tenerife, through its public enterprise Ideco, is taking a proactive stance in the social responsibility initiative known as ‘Dakar for Life’. This impactful project seeks to utilize the universal language of sport to raise awareness about breast cancer, focusing not only on women but also illuminating the lesser-known reality of the disease as it affects men.\nA distinctive pink-painted truck, driven by Canarian athlete Rafael Lesmes, was unveiled this Thursday at the Plaza del Cabildo. Lesmes is set to participate in the Dakar 2025 rally, which will take place from January 3 to 17. The event drew notable figures including the vice president and Minister of Tourism of the Cabildo, Lope Afonso; the Sports Minister, Yolanda Moliné; the Minister of Social Action, Águeda Fumero; the president of the Canarian Carrera por la Vida Foundation, Brigitte Gypen; and the CEO of Ideco, Manuel Gómez.\nFollowing its successful participation in the ‘Dakar Classic 2024’, the Plaza del Cabildo de Tenerife served as the inaugural official stop for the ‘Pink Elephant’, symbolizing the project’s commitment to awareness-raising through sport.\nLope Afonso emphasized the significance of this initiative, asserting that “with this project, the Cabildo of Tenerife demonstrates its commitment to being active participants in the defense of these critical values and the fight against breast cancer as it affects both women and men.” He also underscored the power of sport to promote these values on a global stage, facilitating impactful outreach that will spotlight Tenerife during this prestigious event.\nFurthermore, Yolanda Moliné expressed her commitment to this initiative, stating, “We could not miss this opportunity to raise awareness through sport, giving visibility to breast cancer both in women and also in men. Tenerife will proudly represent with the ‘Pink Elephant’.”\nÁgueda Fumero highlighted that this campaign allows the Social Action area of the Cabildo to “make visible” its collaborative efforts alongside third-sector entities like the ‘Fundación Canaria Carrera por la Vida’. She anticipates that these partnerships will further enhance the Insular Ring of Social Policies next year.\nRafael Lemes conveyed his pride in representing Tenerife, affirming, “The entire team feels very honored and grateful to wear the colors of our beautiful island. This initiative’s ability to engage various audiences, especially in countries that send tourists to Tenerife, is pivotal in advocating for both patients and volunteers striving to raise awareness about breast cancer.”\nBrigitte Gypen elaborated that the foundation strives year-round to enhance the quality of life for breast cancer patients and their families, stressing the crucial nature of raising awareness about this disease.\nThe Spanish team, comprising Rafa Lesmes, Tabatha Romón, and Albert Casabona, aims to replicate their impressive performance from the previous year in the upcoming Dakar edition, where their truck, affectionately called the ‘Elefante desert rose’, achieved a historic milestone by reaching the top of the podium in the ‘Classic Trucks’ category as well as securing ninth position overall.\nBreast cancer predominantly affects women, leaving profound impacts on both the individuals diagnosed and their families. However, an alarming statistic reveals that approximately 2% of men also face this disease, a fact that remains largely unrecognized.\nThe diagnosis of breast cancer in men often occurs at more advanced stages due to its lack of visibility. Sport has emerged as an effective tool for promoting early detection, thus enhancing awareness.\n‘DAKAR FOR LIFE’, in its most international iteration, has experienced remarkable growth, exceeding all prior expectations. The message emblazoned on this truck has resonated across more than 27 countries, garnering over 300,000 mailing subscribers and achieving a total of 751,714 impacts—an impressive 72% increase compared to its inaugural edition.\n**Interview with ‌Rafael​ Lesmes, Driver of the ‘Pink Elephant’‌ for the Dakar for Life Project**\n**Interviewer**: Rafael,⁤ thank you for joining us!​ The ‘Dakar for Life’ ⁤initiative is such an ​innovative way to raise awareness about breast cancer. Can you ‍tell us what inspired this project?\n**Rafael Lesmes**: Thank you for having me! The inspiration⁤ for ‘Dakar⁣ for ⁣Life’⁤ comes from‍ a desire to utilize‌ the ⁢powerful platform of sport ​to spread‍ a serious message. Breast cancer doesn’t just affect women; it also impacts men, although it’s less talked about. Our goal is to bring this issue​ to⁣ light and encourage open⁢ conversations about it.\n**Interviewer**: Absolutely, ​it’s crucial to keep that conversation going. The pink-painted truck looks fantastic! How does it feel to ⁣be at the ⁢helm of⁤ such‌ a vibrant symbol ‍for this ⁢cause?\n**Rafael Lesmes**: It’s an honor, really!⁢ The ​’Pink Elephant’ is not just a truck; it represents hope and awareness. Every time I drive it, I feel like I’m carrying the ⁣message of‍ thousands—patients, survivors , and supporters. ​It’s ⁣a visual⁤ cue ​that stops people in their tracks, and ⁢that’s what we want!\n**Interviewer**: Speaking of visual cues, how has the public responded to⁢ the truck ​and the initiative so far?\n**Rafael Lesmes**: The response has been overwhelmingly positive!​ We’ve had so many people stop ​and ask ⁢about the ‌project. Just in the first few days, we’ve reached over 750,000 people across 27 countries! It shows ‍that there’s a strong desire for awareness and advocacy in‍ this area.\n**Interviewer**:⁢ That’s impressive! With the ‍Dakar ​rally approaching in 2025, what’s next in the plan for the⁢ ‘Pink ​Elephant’?\n**Rafael Lesmes**: We’re going⁣ to ⁣continue our outreach efforts, visiting schools,​ hospitals, ⁣and events⁢ to spread our message even further before the rally. Once we’re at Dakar, we’ll ⁢carry the awareness campaign on a global scale, showing the world ‌that Tenerife is not just about stunning landscapes but also ‍about social responsibility.\n**Interviewer**: It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. What advice do‍ you have for individuals looking to support breast cancer awareness in their communities?\n**Rafael Lesmes**:⁤ I would say the most important thing is to talk about it! Share ⁤information, participate in local initiatives, and don’t shy‌ away from ‌conversations about health—especially concerning men’s health regarding⁤ breast cancer. Every bit ‌of awareness makes a difference, and ​small ⁢actions can accumulate into significant⁣ change.\n**Interviewer**: Great advice!⁤ Before we ⁤wrap⁣ up, is there anything else you’d like the readers to know about ‘Dakar ⁢for Life’?\n**Rafael Lesmes**: Just ⁤that ⁢we​ are all in this together, and every voice matters! The ‘Pink Elephant’⁢ is symbolic of our collective fight against breast cancer. So, whether you’re a participant, ⁤a supporter, or just someone⁢ who’s curious, I encourage everyone to get involved in any way they can!\n**Interviewer**: Rafael, thank you ⁤for sharing⁣ your insights and passion with ⁢us. We look forward to following ⁢your ⁣journey with the ‘Pink Elephant’!\n**Rafael Lesmes**: Thank you! It’s been a‌ pleasure, and‌ remember to keep your eyes on the desert tracks ‍for‍ our pink ⁢powerhouse!",

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on?\nThat question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.\nThe results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized.\nThose who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered.\n“I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study.\nPeople are also reading…\n“It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.”\nAbout 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said.\nThe participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly.\nA follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change.\nThe study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls.\nThat evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars.\n“You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him.\nAdler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him.\nAfter a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy.\nRather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list.\nAfter six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%.\nThe cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75.\nAmong those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said.\n“It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.”\nIn other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered.\n“I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.”\n“It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.”\n20 facts about homelessness in the US\n20 facts about homelessness in the US\nAccording to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022\nThe U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020\nConversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010\nExperts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness\nThe end of the federal eviction moratorium in August 2021 made millions of Americans' housing situations more precarious during the long tail of the COVID-19 pandemic\nAs of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month\nThe marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness\nHUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022\nA greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020\n40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered\nChronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020\nVeteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010\nFamily and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020\n50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022\nSince 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12%\n6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020\nIn 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8%\nThe number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "text": "By Ismael Lopez\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) - Nicaraguan police detained on Thursday two senior Catholic priests who are close to the country's top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising to at least six the number of clergymen detained this week.\nThe source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio, and noted that their arrest brings to at least six the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released.\nThe government's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOver the past few years, Ortega's government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes.\nAviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer.\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticized the government's deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018, and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year.\nLast week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez's detention in 2022.\nMany of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests' alleged crimes.\nNicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released.\n\"I ask God to protect them and that they be freed immediately!\" wrote in a post on X on Thursday.\nAccording to exiled Nicaraguan researcher Martha Patricia Molina, who publishes records of what she describes as the persecution of the Catholic Church under Ortega, the number of bishops, priests and seminarians behind bars in the country currently stands at nine.\n(Reporting by Ismael Lopez; Writing by David Alire Garcia and Miral Fahmy)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Nicaragua , crime , Costa Rica\nRead More",
