    "title": "UK-based voice AI startup Neuphonic secures €3.5M to build world’s fastest text-to-speech tech",
    "text": "London-based Neuphonic , a startup focused on redefining human-AI communication with fast text-to-speech technology, has raised £3M (approximately €3.58M) in its pre-seed round of funding.\nThe investment was led by Moonfire VC , with participation from Tiny VC , Salica Oryx Fund , and Cur8 Capital .\nAkshat Goenka, Partner at Moonfire, says, “Voice AI has been a sleeping giant, held back by technical limitations that Neuphonic is now solving. Their technology has the potential to unlock significant value across multiple industries.”\n“In customer service, it could enable more natural, efficient interactions. For content creators, it opens up new possibilities in localisation and accessibility. In emerging fields like digital avatars and AI gaming, it could be the key to creating truly immersive experiences.”\n“We see Neuphonic’s solution as a catalyst for innovation in these sectors and beyond, potentially unlocking billions in economic value. They could ultimately enable entirely new business models and user experiences that weren’t possible before.”\nEnabling real-time conversational AI with TTS latency under 25ms Neuphonic is addressing the limitations of traditional Conversational AI by offering a text-to-speech algorithm (patent-pending) that enables real-time speech generation with ultra-low latency of 25 milliseconds, making it the fastest in the world.\nThe technology allows for more natural, human-like communication and is compatible with any Large Language Model, regardless of language. Neuphonic’s API is currently available through an exclusive closed beta programme for businesses looking to integrate human-like speech into their products.\nSohaib Ahmad, co-founder and CEO of Neuphonic, says, “High latency in Voice AI prevents natural interaction and slows growth in key fields like gaming, conversational AI, digital avatars, and real-time translation. People are struggling to really interact with Voice AI as a result.”\n“We want to reach a point where AI feels like a natural extension of ourselves – intuitive and effortless. Ideally, people then spend less time staring at screens and more time actually communicating.”\nFounded by Jiameng Gao and Sohaib Ahmad, Neuphonic emerged from the duo’s shared experience studying machine learning at Cambridge University.\nWith multilingual backgrounds and roots in China, Ireland, and Pakistan, Gao and Ahmad were inspired by their insights into language barriers and cultural nuances to develop Neuphonic.\nThey aim to tackle the limitations of current text-to-speech solutions, driven by a passion for voice technology.\nCo-founder and CTO Gao, says, “By generating speech word-by-word as text arrives, we unlock a wide range of use cases for Text-To-Speech that wasn’t possible before – we’re in talks with businesses in customer service, digital reception, humanoid robotics, ed-tech, storytelling, and content creation.”\n“This goes beyond speed improvements and allows us to create AI interactions that feel as natural and responsive as human conversation. Just as how people speak immediately, our models bypass the need for full sentences and in doing so significantly cut down latency.”\nCapital utilisation Neuphonic plans to use the funds to expand its language capabilities and voice offerings, improve model performance through research, and develop on-device solutions.\nProfessor Steve Young CBE, Emeritus Professor of Information Engineering and former Senior Pro-Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University, says, “Neuphonic’s breakthrough in real-time speech synthesis will create a paradigm shift in human-machine interaction.”\n“By reducing latency to near-human levels, they are paving the way for seamless voice interaction that could replace screens in many aspects of our daily lives.”\nWith a growing team and a waiting list of hundreds of potential users and businesses, Neuphonic aims for rapid growth in the voice AI market, which is projected to reach $41.39B by 2030 .",

    "text": "Wendy Guevara habla de Salud Mental y amistad con Nicola Porcella: “Lo defendería con garras y dientes” La influencer habló sobre su enfoque hacia la terapia, la amistad y su lealtad inquebrantable hacia aquellos que ama CIUDAD DE MÉXICO.- En un encuentro con los medios, Wendy Guevara compartió detalles sobre su enfoque hacia la salud mental y su inquebrantable apoyo a sus seres queridos. “Soy consciente de que no soy perfecta, pero intento ser amorosa y brindar apoyo a quienes me rodean,” afirmó la influencer. También enfatizó la importancia de recibir terapia regularmente, ya sea a través de Zoom o en persona cuando tiene la oportunidad de visitar León. A veces voy a terapia por Zoom y cuando puedo ir a León, tengo terapia presencial”, reveló Guevara, subrayando la importancia de la autoayuda en su rutina. La actriz abordó el tema de la amistad, manifestando su incomodidad con las preguntas sobre cómo es como amiga, sugiriendo que tales cuestiones deberían ser dirigidas a su círculo social cercano. “Yo creo que eso se lo tiene que preguntar a las personas de mi círculo social de amistades, porque cualquiera puede echarse flores solo o sola, pero no está bien”, afirmó. A pesar de ello, enfatizó su compromiso inquebrantable de brindar apoyo, incluso si no siempre es correspondido. Lo que siempre he tenido muy presente es que sé dar apoyo y me encanta hacerlo. Aunque a veces otras personas no lo devuelvan, no pasa nada.” Cuando se le preguntó si ella defendería a Nicola en caso de que él fuera atacado de la misma manera en que Gala Montes fue agredida en la Casa de los Famosos México por parte del influencer Adrián Marcelo, Guevara afirmó que sí lo haría. Cabe señalar que tanto Nicola Porcella como Gala Montes son actores que han hablado abiertamente sobre sus problemas mentales y la manera en la que se atienden respecto a ellos. El hecho de que Marcelo atacara a la actriz por su condición mental ha sido ampliamente criticado en redes sociales. “La depresión es un tema que se toca con pincita siempre lo he dicho es bien difícil de de tocar este tema es un debate que se hace puedes durar días debatiéndose”, aclaró Wendy. “Como amigo, yo creo que tienes que dar apoyo y abrazar cuando se necesita un abrazo, enojarte y atacar cuando se necesita atacar. Y yo a él lo hubiera defendido con garras y dientes porque lo amo”, finalizó la influencer.
