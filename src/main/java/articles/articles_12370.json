    "text": "The Lancaster Public Library has a thriving story hour program. From infant story time, toddler story time, pajama story time to mindfulness, song and read and even, sign and read story time, the library draws scores of children every week to its diverse story hour program. Never has it had the groundswell of interest from the public to a program like the one scheduled for March 23: More than 300 families have signed up to attend a Drag Queen Story Hour at the library. The schedule event is fueling opposition from conservative lawmakers but the head librarian said she is happy to host the event and welcome community members to participate in it. “It is very important that we provide information as a library to everyone that we serve in the community,” said Lissa Holland, executive director of the Lancaster Public Library. “This obviously is not just for families who may have a gay child in the family. It’s to show diversity and acceptance. That it’s ok to be who you are. You should love yourself and other people.” Some county and state lawmakers have opposed the event, including members of the Lancaster County House delegation, who on Wednesday called the program a misuse of taxpayer dollars intended to” sexualize” children. “This is a totally political and immoral use of our money,” read the statement jointly issued by state Republican Representatives David Zimmerman, Keith Greiner and Tom Jones. “We need to protect our children!” Holland said the program has nothing to do with the sexual objectification of children. “It is to read some fun books that are very age appropriate. And sing songs, the Hokey Pokey, the Rainbow Connection song from The Muppet Movie, and Teach the World to Sing,” Holland said. “It is very geared to young children to teach kindness and love. That’s all it is. It is not any kind of statement about homesexuality.” Holland rebuff some of the charges being leveled that such programs are intended to groom and indoctrinate children. “I don’t even know what that means,” she said. “This is a program where paretns are with their children. It’s one hour out of many programs that we hold. It’s nothing about being gay. It’s about being who you are.” Both Holland and Lancaster Pride, the organizer, said there are no plans to cancel or postpone the event. “If anything this is pushing us more to doing this,” said Tiffany Shirley, president of Lancaster Pride. “We are not backing down to people who want this shut down. We are showing them we are here and we want to have this event safely and we want to have a great time.” Holland said no one is being forced to attend the event. “If you are not comfortable with that, the bottom line is don’t come,” she said. Holland said the library has received a significant amount of feedback from the community — from both sides, in support of and against it. “We have had some beautiful notes and we’ve had some really hateful emails,” she said. “We have heard both slides loud an clear.” Drag Queen Story Hour at the Lancaster Public Library is free and will take place from 1 to 2 p.m. on March 23.

    "title": "Community Suppers Continue to Fill a Growing Need",
    "text": "As the Island’s cost of living continues to rise, local community supper programs are seeing an increase in residents looking for relief, with demand for food at an all-time high this year. Run by volunteers at many of the Vineyard’s churches, community suppers began years ago as free sit-down dinners open to all in the winter months. The churches worked together to create an alternating schedule so that seven days a week someone could find a free meal during the off-season, along with a respite from the isolation of a Vineyard winter. In recent years, a portion of the meals prepared have supplemented the Harbor Homes overnight winter shelter. During the Covid-19 pandemic, however, many of those programs paused or switched to a pick-up or delivery model out of safety concerns. After considering a return to in-person meals after the pandemic hiatus, many churches are opting to continue their pick-up and drop-off schedules, which can service more Island residents. The First Congregational Church in West Tisbury has seen an increase of 20 more regular patrons this year for its Wednesday dinner. Volunteer organizer Marjorie Peirce said the church is averaging about 140 meals a week. Many of those patrons have never participated in the program before, she added. “Their situations have changed,” Ms. Peirce said. “Food costs a lot, housing still costs a lot.” St. Andrew’s Church in Edgartown has seen a similar increase, reporting new people each week at their Monday night in-person dinners. At the same time, the parish is in dire need of drivers to deliver meals to the winter shelter. “I think they just feel like their dollar isn’t stretching as far as it once did,” volunteer Lisa Lucier said. “Even when we go shopping [for the program], I notice our money is going quickly.” The Good Shepherd Parish food pantry, which supplies many of the ingredients for these dinners, has also seen unprecedented demand. Sarah Stiegelman, who has run the pantry for the past year, said the pantry’s weekly visitors have jumped from 70 last winter to 175 each week this year. “I don’t have enough food,” she said. “On Monday I bought 140 pounds of groceries and [two days later] my shelves are bare.” Ms. Stiegelman stocks the pantry through an account with the Greater Boston Food Bank, but she said high grocery costs have created a “trickle down effect” across eastern Massachusetts. The Food Bank itself is short on options because of increased demand, she said. “There are close to 50,000 accounts and we’re all battling over four cases of lettuce,” she said. Programs are also starting earlier in the season than usual, largely to support the overnight shelter’s influx of new guests. The winter shelter has seen double the number of regular visitors this season, nearing its 28-person capacity almost every night since opening in November. The shelter depends on food donations from the community suppers and local restaurants to feed its guests each night. Joyful Eatings, a program run through the Federated Church in Edgartown, donates all of its prepared food to the winter shelter in lieu of a community dinner. This winter the program started a month earlier to help meet the demand. It also began meeting once a week instead of once a month. “The church has really stepped up to fill that void,” said Gretchen Regan, an Island chef and Joyful Eatings coordinator. “In the past, we were cooking for eight or ten people, but now we’re preparing dinner for 20-plus people . . . It’s a lot.” Good Shepherd Parish and the Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center run a joint community supper program, serving about 80 takeout meals each Thursday, hosted at St. Augustine’s Church in Vineyard Haven. Having only just started up this month, the program has yet to see an increase over last year, volunteer Mary Ellen Larsen said. The United Methodist Church in Oak Bluffs is the only other church hosting in-person dinners. The Saturday meals began earlier this month, Rev. Joanne Hus said. Volunteers stressed that the suppers continue to provide much-needed human connection, whether hosting dine-in meals or takout. “Some people don’t see anyone else that day,” Ms. Peirce said of the dinner deliveries. Many patrons are older, live by themselves or have medical conditions that limit their mobility, she said. In one case, Ms. Peirce said her volunteers deliver to a camp in the middle of the forest, where four men have continued to live outside through the winter. Ms. Peirce emphasized that more volunteers are always needed. “Our program is really focused on keeping it sustainable,” she said. “We want to keep doing this as long as we can.”",

    "title": "Tool found in A380 engine after nearly 300 flight hours • The Register",
    "text": "An Airbus A380 operated by Australian airline Qantas clocked over 290 hours of flight time despite a tool having been left inside one of its engines, according to a report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.\nThe 1.25 metre nylon rod, a \"turning tool\", was used during an inspection of the left outer engine's intermediate-pressure compressor on December 6 of last year, during a three-day routine maintenance check at Los Angeles Airport (LAX).\nIt was left in the engine by a maintenance worker who departed his shift early for medical reasons. The worker was told to leave it in place, as it was still in use, and assumed a colleague would ensure the tool was removed.\nOver the course of the three-day inspection period, multiple engineers rotated shifts. It was noted that the tool had not been returned after being checked out. Maintenance crews did search for the tool, but it wasn’t found during two inspections – first because it was dark and an engineer didn't use a flashlight, and the second time because the inlet cowl where it sat was not examined.\nAccording to the Safety Bureau report , at least some of the engineers didn't even realize what part they were looking for and thought the missing tool was a larger gearbox turning tool. If it had been the gearbox tool, it would have been reasonable to assume it would be more visible inside the engine.\nA missing tool report was lodged in software used to manage maintenance – but the required follow-up never happened. Despite the fact the tool was known to be missing, the giant jet was signed out of maintenance and allowed to fly. Qantas personnel in Sydney even requested removal of the report as it was causing problems – in response, the tool's status was downgraded.\nThirty-four flight cycles and 293.74 flight hours later, the tool was found during another routine scheduled maintenance session – nearly a month after it had been lost. It was found lodged behind the low-pressure compressor (LPC) blades.\nJustice Dept reportedly starts criminal probe into Boeing door bolt incident Toyota and Joby complete Japan's first air taxi flight test Fraud guilty plea flies from Boeing to swerve courtroom over 737 Max crashes Boom Supersonic takes baby steps toward breaking the sound barrier The Safety Bureau noted that there was no observable damage to any engine components. However, the incident did cause damage to the tool, as it was deformed by airflow.\nAs you’d expect after nearly 300 hours in the challenging environment of a jet engine.\nThe board noted that had the tool been left in a different position – for example in front of the low-pressure compressor – it may have been more visible to the engineers. It also would have caused more damage in that position, as it would pass through the rotating LPC blades during flight.\nThe turning tool spotted – Click to enlarge\nThe mishap has been chalked up to having a rotating crew of maintenance workers, and bad advice to leave the tool in place – which diminished any sense of ownership and accountability for its whereabouts.\nQantas has taken action. It filed an internal incident report when the tool was found, and briefed staff on the importance of using tracking software – and presumably not leaving them in the engines of an A380. In March it completed an internal investigation and issued engineers a safety directive on tools.\nThe affected aircraft continues to operate in Qantas's fleet – which is quite a lucky outcome.\nThe Register spoke to two aircraft engineers about the incident – both of whom requested anonymity.\n\"Any Foreign Object Debris (FOD) can lead to catastrophic engine failure,\" summarized one of the aviation professionals. \"Standard practice is to check tools in and out to prevent this.\"\n\"There would be negligible impact to performance, though the safety risk would be quite large. The odds of a tool such as this causing a catastrophic engine failure would be quite high,\" explained the other. \"While the engine failure wouldn't necessarily lead to loss of the aircraft, the debris could.\"\n\"The fact the tool was left on the aircraft is a severe breach of flight line safeguards, where all tools should be accounted for before the aircraft is returned to service,\" he added.\nThe crashes of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 in 2018 and that of United 232 in 1989 were both attributed to uncontained engine failures caused by loose debris, though neither was a result of an errant tool. In both cases, engine components broke apart and debris escaped the engine casing.\nThe Southwest Airlines incident resulted in one fatality and many injuries, while the United Airlines crash led to 111 fatalities.\nThe aviation industry has faced much scrutiny lately over safety. Notably, the US Department of Justice lodged a criminal investigation this year against Boeing when an aircraft door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 flight in January.\nIt's also recently experienced labor strikes from well-known airplane makers – including Textron and Boeing – as unionized workers seek better pay and working conditions. ®\nGet our Tech Resources",

    "text": "Mexico City, Dec 29 (IANS): Mexico and the United States agreed to strengthen their collaboration to address \"the root causes\" of irregular migration and to halt human trafficking, Mexico's Foreign Ministry (SRE) has announced.\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador received a delegation of high-level U.S. officials in its capital Mexico City on Wednesday, following the agreement made last week with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, to address new measures to reduce irregular migratory flows, the SRE said in a statement, Xinhua news agency reported.\nThe SRE detailed that the two countries at the meeting reaffirmed their commitment to promoting orderly, humane and regular migration.\n\"This includes strengthening our cooperation to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, inequality and violence,\" the ministry said.\n\"Ongoing cooperation also includes enhanced efforts to disrupt human smuggling, trafficking, and criminal networks, and continuing the work to promote legal instead of irregular migration pathways,\" it added.\nThe two countries' delegations agreed to meet again in the U.S. capital in January 2024 to continue advancing their joint management of migration in the context of the regional migration crisis.\nIn November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded 242,418 migrant detentions along the border with Mexico, mostly Central Americans and South Americans.\nIn recent days, the flow of migrants on the border with the United States rose to unprecedented levels to between 10,000 and 12,000 per day, which led to the partial closure of some crossings.\nDisclaimer:\nPlease write your correct name and email address.
