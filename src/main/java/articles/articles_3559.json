( [KKTV](https://www.kktv.com/2024/04/03/retired-marine-cancer-survivor-colorado-springs-completes-10-hour-swim-celebrate-remission/)/Gray News) - A retired Marine and cancer survivor in Colorado celebrates the anniversary of his remission with a feat he picked up during his service. Michael LaBarge said he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV brain cancer, 21 years ago on April 2. LaBarge said he has been in remission for a while and that he swims for 10 hours on the anniversary to celebrate it. “The prognosis was two weeks to 10 months … 21 years ago,” he told [KKTV](https://www.kktv.com/2024/04/03/retired-marine-cancer-survivor-colorado-springs-completes-10-hour-swim-celebrate-remission/). “I did this a lot in the Marines. [Today,] I started at 6 a.m., stopping at 4 p.m.” He completed his swim this year at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s Community Pool in Colorado Springs. Chris Gesterling, the USAFA Pool Aquatics Manager, said he often sees LaBarge at the pool, and his story of surviving cancer is inspiring. “Former Marine ... you know, he beat brain cancer so everything is possible for him,” Gesterling said. As LaBarge swam, he also shared his message for those fighting similar battles to the one he faced. “Hopefully, this will inspire people with cancer to get out, stay active and, you know, don’t get too down on themselves,” he said.

    "title": "Roche sticks with Parkinson’s drug despite second study failure | BioPharma Dive",
    "text": "An experimental drug for Parkinson’s disease that Roche has been developing for more than a decade just flunked another key clinical trial.\nBut in spite of those failures, the drug’s future isn’t clear. Roche’s Chief Medical Officer, Levi Garraway, said in a statement Thursday there were enough positive signs in the latest results to “merit further exploration.” The Swiss pharmaceutical giant plans to present those results at an upcoming medical meeting, and in the meantime will further evaluate the data and work with health authorities to determine next steps for the program.\nRoche gained access to the drug, now called prasinezumab, more than a decade ago, through a collaboration agreement with its original developer, Prothena. Roche offered $45 million on the front end and up to $600 million overall, and agreed to shoulder the majority of the costs associated with research and commercialization. In exchange, it would get 70% of any resulting profits.\nSo far, prasinezumab has yet to notch a clear victory in clinical testing. A trial titled “PASADENA” enrolled a little over 300 participants with early Parkinson’s and compared two different doses of the drug against a placebo. Results from the study, which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2022, found the drug was not significantly better at slowing the progression of the disease.\nA second, larger Phase 2 experiment has now found the same. The “PADOVA” trial enrolled 586 participants, who were evaluated for a minimum of 18 months while on “stable” treatment for their Parkinson’s symptoms. According to Roche, prasinezumab had a positive effect — a roughly 16% numerical benefit on the study’s main goal of slowing the decline in patients’ motor functions — but it did not significantly outperform the placebo group.\nHowever, Roche said the drug’s effect was more pronounced among the 75% of participants who were also taking levodopa, the most common medicine used to treat Parkinson’s motor symptoms. And there were “consistent positive trends” across “multiple” other study objectives.\nWhile Roche parses through this data, it plans to continue two follow-on studies from PASADENA and PADOVA, in which all participants receive prasinezumab.\nThis stance from Roche may explain why, despite the trial’s outcome, shares of Prothena were up 34% Thursday afternoon, to trade at just over $16 apiece.\nAnalysts viewed Roche’s study, like many neuroscience experiments, as high-risk, high-reward, and therefore say they weren’t surprised by the failure. Still, the “signals of activity clearly keeping some hope alive for the program likely exceeded [Wall Street’s] expectations and justify some stock rebound on this news,” wrote Brian Abrahams, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who covers Prothena, in a note to clients.\nAbrahams argues that Roche’s results suggest a separate study, with a “patient population enriched for levodopa use” could set prasinezumab up for success. Yet, going down that path might limit the drug’s total addressable population and peak sales opportunity, which “may already be capped” by its “somewhat modest efficacy” and it being given as an intravenous infusion.\nPrasinezumab is an antibody drug designed to latch onto aggregates of a protein that, according to research, can cause Parkinson’s if it folds improperly. Many big swings at Parkinson’s, from powerful companies ranging from AstraZeneca to Sanofi to AbbVie , have revolved around this “alpha synuclein” protein. Success remains elusive, though. Just this week, Belgian drugmaker UCB announced that a Parkinson’s medicine it’s been developing with Novartis failed in “proof-of-concept” testing .",

Esjay Sports recently partnered with a school in KZN for learners with severe disabilities. Those children painted wonderful abstract art using their feet or mouths. Their works are now printed on one of Esjay’s clothing lines.\nOur Grade Threes were challenged to tuck their arms inside their shirts and paint a picture using their foot or mouth. The children found it a huge challenge, but they loved it.\n“Pushing boundaries, creating, and developing empathy for the disabled in our country were such valuable lessons learnt today. Well done to Esjay Sports for what they do in South Africa,” Calmeyer said.\nAs the school supports kids living with disabilities, she called on their parents to send them to school. “This would unleash their potential and teach others not to discriminate against them. They must be given equal opportunities,” Calmeyer concluded.",

    "title": "School board votes to repair, reopen Mount Charleston school",
    "text": "The Clark County School District will repair the storm-damaged school on Mount Charleston, possibly reopening it in time for the next school year. The school board agreed Wednesday to fast-track fixes to the tiny Lundy Elementary School, which has been closed since a tropical storm battered the mountain in August 2023. The exact cost and timeline have not been settled, but Brandon McLaughlin, an assistant superintendent for CCSD’s construction and development division, said the district would aim to have work complete by August 2025. Wednesday's decision was the third time the school board had addressed Lundy since June. It initially deadlocked on an attempt to either reopen or permanently close the school, which last enrolled about a dozen students. Then it decided, on a slim majority, to pursue a partnership with the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District to build a classroom annex and playground on the grounds of the nearby Mt. Charleston Library. If CCSD had built onto the library it wouldn’t have repaired the 58-year-old Lundy, which saw its parking lot destroyed , foundation threatened and septic system washed away as the storm’s flow bypassed historic runoff channels and created a new drainage path through campus. The district has said the building is unsafe. But the library option was not popular with the library board and mountain residents alike. And the school board composition has changed since their votes taken over the summer, with two recent resignations. Former school board members Katie Williams and Lola Brooks were on the side that disagreed with repairing and preferred to explore joining forces with the library. Nakia Jackson-Hale, Williams’ appointed replacement, broached the topic of reconsidering Lundy's future. “When I was sworn in on Oct. 30 , I said that I would hit the ground running,” Jackson-Hale said. She has visited Lundy twice, met with constituents and reviewed available documents. She said she saw issues, like the repair estimate noting flaws not related to the flood and that there was no written documentation from the county affirming that the building is unsafe. She said parents told her they still haven’t heard from CCSD about how to retrieve their children’s belongings that remain in classrooms when the school closed suddenly. Displaced students were reassigned to Indian Springs Elementary, which is about a 40-mile bus ride each way, unless they choose another option like homeschooling or transferring to another school in Las Vegas, which is at least half an hour down the mountain. “I just feel like there is a lack of empathy, compassion, communication,” Jackson-Hale said. “There's too many issues with the way that this was all handled.” Lundy advocates had similar criticisms . Katie Corr, a mountain resident and mother, said she knows the school is the heart of the tight-knit community, having attended Lundy in the 1990s. “The elementary school years are the most formative for students, laying the foundation for learning, growth and a love of education,” she said. “Yet currently in our community, productivity and engagement are hindered when our students must wake up at 5:30 in the morning to catch a bus or drive down the mountain to Las Vegas and they often don't return until the sun is going down after 3 o’clock.” Mountain resident Michael Thompson appealed to board members to consider their legacy. “You can be a hero and provide an opportunity,” he said. If nurtured, the school could grow while remaining small. Lydia Dominguez, who will become the school board member representing Lundy in January and is a former member of the district attendance and zoning advisory committee, said CCSD didn't follow the process for rezoning and assigning students, “I don’t know what is with Lundy, if somebody has something against Lundy, but it really is obvious to the public that things are being hidden,” she said. “There is loss of trust in the public with this situation.” Although the bidding process for the repairs has not begun – CCSD staff had been working with previous school board direction to build the annex at the library instead – district officials have previously estimated that repairs would cost close to $6.8 million. By agreeing to repair the existing school, the library partnership is now off the table. Board President Evelyn Garcia Morales had previously supported a closure and building classrooms at the library. She said the cost to repair is significant, and that money could impact schools in her area of the district, which includes North Las Vegas and the Historic Westside. But people have made it clear they didn't want the library “The community has already come to us on multiple occasions at multiple meetings (asking) when are we going to listen to them. Despite our best interests in providing an in between, it hasn't worked. We have a choice,” she said. “I'm activating my ability to choose in support of something that could bring a lot of value to our entire community.”",

    "text": "Tres personas sospechosas de preparar atentados contra iglesias y sinagogas en Turquía han sido detenidas dentro de una operación donde han sido arrestadas también otras 29 que se cree tienen contactos con círculos yihadistas y estaban implicados en esos planes. Una operación simultánea en nueve provincias turcas, coordinada por la policía junto a los servicios secretos (MIT), permitió detener a esas tres personas, supuestamente dirigentes de las redes del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico, o Daesh, en Turquía, informa este viernes la agencia oficialista Anadolu. La emisora pública turca TRT los identifica como Miybel el Shuweihi y Mohamed Hilaf Ibrahim, conocido como Abu Leis, sospechosos de preparar atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en Turquía. El tercero sería Iheb Alani, que se cree estaba coordinando un ataque contra la embajada iraquí en Turquía, agrega la citada emisora. Además, las fuerzas de seguridad han detenido a otras 29 personas sospechosas de estar vinculadas a las redes yihadistas en Turquía. Hace una semana, la Policía detuvo a 304 personas bajo sospecha de mantener lazos con las células del Estado Islámico. Desde el atentado contra la discoteca Reina en Estambul en la Nochevieja de 2016, en la que un yihadista mató con un arma automática a 39 personas, las autoridades turca extreman la vigilancia en estas fechas. Aunque la Nochevieja se celebra popularmente en Turquía y no falta decoración navideña, algunos predicadores radicales se han pronunciado contra estas festividades por \"cristianas\" o \"paganas\". Desde el atentado contra el Reina, Turquía, que en 2016-2017 llevó a cabo una operación militar contra el Estado Islámico en el norte de Siria, no ha vuelto a sufrir atentados atribuidos al yihadismo.

    "text": "(Minghui.org) Falun Dafa practitioners held an information day in Antwerpen’s city center on March 23, 2024 to introduce the traditional mind-body practice of Falun Dafa. After learning how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) persecutes the spiritual discipline, many people signed petitions calling to end the brutality, and two Chinese students quit the CCP organizations they previously joined. Located in northwestern Belgium, Antwerpen is the country’s third largest city. Known as the hub of the world’s diamond trade, it also has the second largest port in Europe after Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It’s an important city for the region, historically, economically and culturally.

After she and a friend stopped by the Falun Dafa booth and read the materials, she thanked practitioners for holding the event. She said that she did not know about Falun Dafa or the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. “More people need to know what is going on in China so that they will have a chance to sign the petitions and stop the tragedies in China,” Tianka explained. “What is happening in China is wrong. We must end the suppression because it is so vicious.” Upon leaving, she thanked practitioners again and said, “The principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance are very good. I like them very much.” [Veronica signed a petition to support practitioners. ](/u/article_images/2024-3-27-belgium-antwerpen-07.jpg) Veronica was on her way to a train station when she stopped at the table to sign a petition. She said that she first heard about Falun Dafa during an event in Stuttgart, but she did not have time to sign a petition at the time. A practitioner thanked Veronica for signing and suggested she check online for more information about Falun Dafa. “I definitely will,” Veronica said as she hurried to the train station. Falun Dafa Brings Peace Two engineers, Antonio and Seda, stopped to watch as practitioners demonstrated the Falun Dafa exercises. In a conversation with a practitioner, Antonio said this was the first time he’d heard about Falun Dafa. He explained that he was interested in meditation, and found it amazing that practitioners were able to peacefully mediate in the noisy, crowded city center. He and Seda agreed that the principles of Falun Dafa were important for everyone. [Engineers Antonio and Seda agree with Falun Dafa’s principles. ](/u/article_images/2024-3-27-belgium-antwerpen-08.jpg) They were sorry to hear about the persecution in China and wished practitioners well. “Falun Dafa brings us peace, and improves people’s minds and bodies,” Seda affirmed. Flory, a teacher, talked with practitioners for a long time. “The principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance are the best for everyone and they can make our lives more meaningful,” Flory said. As a teacher, he understands the importance of explaining these values to students. He believed doing so could improve children’s growth of mind and body, and he thanked practitioners for their efforts. Chinese Students Renounce CCP Organizations Two Chinese students also joined the crowd reading materials at the table. They did not know much about Falun Dafa, but knew the practice was not allowed in China. Seeing so many Westerners practicing Falun Dafa, they were curious and wanted to find out why. A practitioner explained what Falun Dafa is, and said that practitioners align their words and behavior according to the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. He went on to say that the five sets exercises are greatly beneficial both physically and spiritually, and this is why Falun Dafa is now practiced in over 100 countries. The students said they agreed with the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. The practitioner told them the CCP could not tolerate traditional values so it began targeting practitioners in 1999, just like it suppressed other groups in numerous political campaigns in the past. To achieve this, the regime made up defamatory hate propaganda to deceive people, such as the [staged Tiananmen Square Self-Immolation Incident](https://en.minghui.org/cc/88/). The practitioner also told the students that the CCP detains and tortures practitioners for their belief, and even kills them for their organs. The students said they’d joined the CCP’s Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers when they were children. They were happy to renounce their memberships in these organizations, for a better future.

    "text": "IUML: BJP using Ram Temple consecration event for political purposes Malappuram (Kerala), Dec 29 (PTI) The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a key ally of the Congress-led UDF in Kerala, accused the BJP on Friday of exploiting the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya for political purposes. The IUML expressed hope that secular forces would recognise this political manoeuvre of the BJP. Amid increasing uncertainty in the Congress's Kerala state unit on the political stance the party should take regarding the invitation to its national leadership for the Ram Temple consecration ceremony on January 22, the IUML urged the Congress to take an independent decision. \"The BJP is treating it as a political inauguration for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The prime minister and others have launched a political propaganda aimed at the next parliamentary election,\" IUML National General Secretary P K Kunhalikutty told reporters after the party's political affairs committee meeting. Alleging that the saffron party is politicising the event by differentiating between those who participate in it and those who don't, Kunhalikutty said, \"The BJP government's target is the next parliamentary elections. The League highly respects the faith and freedom of worship of the Hindu community. No comment on that. But the opening of the Ram temple is being used politically.\" He said the issue is political, not religious, and called on every political party, especially those with secular views, to realise this and take independent decisions. On the Congress's stand, Kunhalikutty said, \"Congress has its own set up, leadership. They are facing a lot of problems. Let them take an independent decision.\" IUML supremo Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal added that the IUML supports the faithful on the issue but cannot accept the attempt to turn it into a political agenda for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The IUML's statement is seen as an attempt to exert pressure on the Congress's state unit, which is in a difficult position regarding the invitation extended to its national leaders for the consecration ceremony next month. The ruling CPI(M) in the state has already declared that its representatives will not attend the ceremony, considering it a political move by the BJP ahead of the general elections that are to be held in a few months.
