    "title": "Biden Signs Executive Order Sanctioning Four Israeli “Settlers” Involved In Attacks Against Palestinians",
    "text": "President Joe Biden has signed an executive order to sanction four Israelis who his administration claims have been involved in attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The four individuals were named as: - David Chai Chasdai, identified by the US as the leader of an attack on the northern West Bank village of Huwara last year, which resulted in the death of a Palestinian. - Eitan Tanjil, accused by the State Department of participating in violent attacks on Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists using stones and clubs, causing injuries that necessitated medical attention. - Shalom Zicherman, alleged by the US to have attacked Israeli activists and their vehicles in the West Bank, including blocking their path on the road and trying to smash the windows of vehicles with activists inside. - Yinon Levi, whom Washington claims routinely directed groups of settlers from the Meitarim Farm outpost in aggressive acts against Palestinian and Bedouin civilians. This included threats of further violence to force them from their homes, burning their fields, and damaging their property. In a statement announcing the sanctions, the White House said that President Biden “has been clear that the United States strongly supports Israel’s right to defend itself following the horrific terrorist attacks that occurred on October 7 and in its effort to defeat Hamas to make sure that such an attack never happens again.” However, it adds that the president has “concern about the rise in violence that we have seen in the West Bank from extremist actors—in particular the rise in extremist settler violence, which reached record levels in 2023. This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.” Despite these new sanctions, the US State Department acknowledged that violence against Palestinians has gone down since an initial round of sanctions in which dozens of Israelis were hit with visa bans and other punitive measures. “We have seen the level of extremist settler violence come down somewhat, not come down enough, we want to see more, but the interventions we have made have made a difference,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. Prime Minister Netanyahu issued the following Statement following US President Biden’s Executive Order: “The overwhelming majority of residents in Judea and Samaria are law-abiding citizens, many of whom are currently fighting – as conscripts and reservists – to defend Israel. Israel acts against all Israelis who break the law, everywhere; therefore, exceptional measures are unnecessary.” (YWN World Headquarters – NYC)",

    "text": "Ronaldo em Garota do Momento. (Foto: reprodução/Globo) Em Garota do Momento , Bia (Maisa) tenta mais uma vez prejudicar Beatriz (Duda Santos) em uma nova tentativa de desestabilizar a protagonista. Dessa vez, a vilã se junta a Juliano (Fábio Assunção) e recebe orientações de Maristela (Lília Cabral) para sabotar a apresentação de Beatriz em um concurso importante. O objetivo de Bia é impedir que Beatriz conquiste o posto de garota-propaganda de uma marca de cerveja, o que ameaça o futuro da mocinha.\nSabendo da grande chance de Beatriz de ganhar, Bia decide agir de forma traiçoeira. Aproveitando seu cargo de estagiária na agência de publicidade, ela coloca um chá de jambu na bebida de Beatriz. A planta, que tem a capacidade de adormecer a boca, pode prejudicar a fala e até fazer a pessoa babar, criando uma situação constrangedora para a concorrente.\nNo entanto, o plano de Bia não sai como o esperado. Ronaldo (João Vitor Silva), atento ao que acontece, desconfia das intenções da vilã e consegue intervir antes que Beatriz beba a bebida adulterada, derrubando a xícara. Porém, na tentativa de evitar o mal, Ronaldo acaba bebendo o chá por acidente e sofre os efeitos do jambu, ficando com a boca adormecida.\nO ocorrido gera uma grande confusão, mas Ronaldo deixa claro seu desagrado pela atitude de Bia, o que a deixa ainda mais irritada e frustrada com o fracasso de seu plano. Bia volta para casa emburrada, enquanto Beatriz, determinada como nunca, segue firme na competição, pronta para alcançar seu objetivo.\n➡️ Veja também: resumo dos próximos capítulos de Garota do Momento\nCriada e escrita por Alessandra Poggi e com direção artística de Natália Grimberg, Garota do Momento tem no elenco principal nomes como os de Duda Santos, Pedro Novaes, Maisa, Carol Castro, Fábio Assunção, Lília Cabral, Letícia Colin Paloma Duarte, Danton Mello, Eduardo Sterblitch, Maria Flor, Ícaro Silva, Cauê Campos, Klara Castanho e Silvero Pereira.",

    "text": "Innovative Miniature Bipedal Robot Paves Way for Compact Mechanized Assistance\nIn an impressive technological advancement, engineers have recently developed a bipedal robot known as ‘Mugatu’ which stands out due to its small stature and efficient design. Unlike typical bipedal robots that often require complex and bulky systems for movement, Mugatu operates using a single motor that coordinates both legs. Powering this miniature marvel is a single lithium-polymer battery, and control is achieved through an embedded Arduino microcomputer.\nDespite measuring just 18.5 cm in height, Mugatu’s design allows for potential adaptations into even smaller robotics. It achieves a stable walking motion by shifting its center of gravity towards the moving leg, providing space for the subsequent leg to step forward. This results in a compact and reliable robot that has significant implications for the future of automated tasks.\nThis development signifies a leap forward in robotics, as it showcases how the benefits of bipedal locomotion can be harnessed in tiny, efficient packages. The Mugatu’s design opens the door for its use in confined spaces, such as in conducting industrial inspections or assisting in disaster relief efforts where larger robots would be impractical.\nThe creation of Mugatu demonstrates that the future might hold a myriad of applications for small-scale robots, shaking up the standard approach to robotic assistance and proving that great things indeed come in small packages. The Carnegie Mellon University’s innovation heralds a new era in robotics, with the potential for miniaturized robots to operate alongside humans in various challenging environments.\nFAQ Section:\nWhat is the Mugatu robot?\nMugatu is a small-sized bipedal robot recently developed by engineers, notable for its efficient design and the ability to walk with only a single motor coordinating both legs.\nHow does Mugatu move differently from other bipedal robots?\nUnlike typical bipedal robots that require complex and bulky systems for movement, Mugatu achieves stable walking by using a single motor and shifts its center of gravity towards the moving leg. This allows the other leg to step forward, resulting in a more compact and reliable motion.\nWhat powers the Mugatu robot?\nMugatu is powered by a single lithium-polymer battery and controlled by an embedded Arduino microcomputer.\nHow tall is Mugatu and can it be adapted into smaller forms?\nMugatu stands at 18.5 cm in height, and its design allows for potential adaptations into even smaller robotics.\nWhat are the potential applications for the Mugatu robot?\nDue to its small size and efficient design, the Mugatu robot can be used in confined spaces for tasks such as industrial inspections or assisting with disaster relief efforts where larger robots would be impractical.\nWhat does the development of Mugatu signify for the future of robotics?\nThe creation of Mugatu represents a significant technological advancement in robotics, showing that the benefits of bipedal locomotion can be used in tiny, efficient robots.
