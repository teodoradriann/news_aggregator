    "text": "Alabama Task Force 1 deploys from Mobile to Texas to aid in flood recovery\nALTF1 headed to Texas Thursday afternoon.\nMOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - The AL-TF1 team has been activated and deployed around 4 p.m. from the Western Administrative Complex this afternoon.\nGovernor Kay Ivey announced Alabama is assisting Texas in their search and rescue mission following the devastating flooding. The 40-person team being deployed includes Alabama Task Force 1 out of Mobile, Tuscaloosa Fire and Saraland Fire.\n“Search and rescue remains the goal, and Alabama is going to do all we can to lend a helping hand to Texas,” said Governor Ivey in a press release. “We are heartbroken in Alabama to have lost two of our own. I pray for Sarah Marsh’s family as they navigate the unimaginable loss of their precious daughter. My prayers are also with the Santanas as they grieve the loss of Camille and are still searching for three members of their family. Truly, we are all grieving alongside these Alabamians, as well as those in Texas and across our country.”\nImmediately following the tragedy, Governor Ivey aligned state resources so that the state could quickly act, upon Texas’ call.\nThe team is capable of conducting search and rescue response efforts for all hazards, including locating, accessing, medically stabilizing and extricating survivors from impacted structures and areas. Specialized operational personnel include rescue, canine search, medical, hazmat, technical search and communications.\n“This means a lot to us. We’re here to serve whether it’s our local community or areas like this to respond to those who have been affected,” said Andrew Edwards, Search Team Manager for ALTF1.\nCopyright 2025 WALA.

Stava spingendo la propria mountain bike in discesa sul sentiero numero 156, sul Monte Grappa, quando ha perso l'equilibrio ed è caduto in una trincea della Grande Guerra profonda tre metri.\nL'incidente si è verificato attorno a mezzogiorno: l'uomo, un 65enne di Piazzola sul Brenta, ha sbattuto violentemente contro il terreno all'interno della trincea, riportando un trauma alla colonna. Fortunatamente con lui c'era un amico, che ha immediatamente allertato i soccorsi: sul posto è volato l'elicottero Falco 2, che ha provveduto a sbarcare, in \"hovering\", l'equipe medica e il tecnico di elisoccorso.\nIl 65enne è stato stabilizzato sul posto e poi i soccorritori lo hanno imbarellato: è stato recuperato a bordo dell'elicottero con un verricello di 15 metri e poi trasportato all'ospedale di Belluno per gli accertamenti e le cure del caso.\nSuccessivamente l'elicottero ha dovuto volare in direzione del Monte Talvena per prestare i soccorsi ad una donna di 64 anni di Paese. Mentre stava scendendo assieme al compagno dalla via normale, la 64enne è inciampata, infortunandosi ad una caviglia. Il tecnico di elisoccorso è stato calato con un verricello di trenta metri e ha prestato le prime cure alla donna.\nEntrambi poi sono stati recuperati a bordo e l'escursionista è stata condotta all'ospedale San Martino.",

    "text": "(WASHINGTON) – The Teamsters are joining Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and a bipartisan coalition of over 30 Senators in demanding that Amazon cooperate with a congressional inquiry requesting information on its exploitative Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program.\nThe lawmakers made the demand in a recent letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, after the company sent a dishonest response to an earlier Senate oversight letter calling on Amazon to divulge whether its mistreatment and micromanagement of DSPs is compliant with federal labor law.\n“Andy Jassy and Jeff Bezos think they can lie to the American people and break the law without consequences,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien. “This company is making billions off the backs of the hardworking men and women that drive Amazon vans, wear Amazon vests, and deliver Amazon packages, yet Amazon executives still have the audacity to turn around and deny that they’re Amazon employees. No company should be above the law, period. The Teamsters continue to support Senate efforts that hold this corporate bully accountable for its dishonesty and mistreatment of its workers.”\nSen. Murphy noted that Amazon’s response to the earlier Senate oversight letter “included multiple self-contradictory statements, general assertions without factual support instead of the information requested and claims at odds with publicly available data and highly credible investigative journalism.”\n“Amazon’s letter to the U.S. Senate is full of lies,” said DSP Driver Jessie Moreno, who joined his co-workers in organizing with Teamsters Local 396. “Amazon is claiming that it doesn’t control its drivers, but we all know that’s not true. Amazon needs to take responsibility for our safety and well-being while we are delivering their packages. Amazon drivers and warehouse workers are standing together to demand the good jobs we deserve.”\nLast month, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy broke federal labor laws by making anti-union threats.\nThe Senators gave Jassy until July 5 to respond to their latest letter.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

    "text": "PORTLAND, OR - In the last 20 years, Lindsey Anderson, leading online business consultant, has become one of the most influential voices in the digital marketing space. To date, her work has been showcased in several major media publications such as Fox, NBC, CBS, Huffington Post, ABC, and others. A business scaling expert, Lindsey offers multiple programs—including the Content That Converts 90-Day Transformation Program and the 1:1 Mastery Program—that help coaches, consultants and experts generate more high-quality leads and convert them into paying clients.

Author of the best-selling book, The Click Technique, and host of The Millionaire Maker Show podcast, Lindsey has developed several online marketing strategies that have been instrumental in helping entrepreneurs scale their online businesses. Now, she will be putting her business acumen to the test when she appears on Netflix’s highly anticipated reality TV series, The Trust: A Game of Greed. The upcoming show’s premise revolves around a group of 11 strangers who are competing to win the grand prize—a quarter of a million dollars. The catch? The contestants are awardedthe prize money at the beginning of the show in the form of a trust. The money belongs to them, and if they survive the entire season, each contestant will be able to claim an even share. Unlike the average game show, the contestants’ fates are entirely dependent on each other, facing the dilemma of sharing the prize equally or strategically voting each other out. With the power to eliminate a contestant with just one vote, Lindsey and her peers grapple with the decision between relationships and money. The Trust is a riveting social experiment filled with drama, featuring betrayal, deception, paranoia, and greed as contestants fight to keep the big prize. The show challenges the conventional timeline of trust development, exploring whether trust can emerge among strangers when money is on the line.

    "title": "What are the best restaurant patios on the North Shore - North Shore News",
    "text": "Nothing says summer like a cool, refreshing drink as you enjoy the summer warmth in a comfortable, shaded patio.\nThis time of the year is peak patio season, and it’s the perfect opportunity to take advantage of the beautiful skies and lively scenes before rain and clouds settle back in. Order a filling, delicious meal coupled with a colorful beverage, and enjoy the good vibes. And, you know what’s even better? Patio season is a perfect fit for all, whether you want to go alone and peacefully soak in your surroundings while you enjoy your food, or whether you want to bring your loved ones for a bustling conversation and grab a spoonful out of each other’s dishes.\nThough there’s plenty of great options around town, the North Shore News has tried our best to compile a list of some of the best patio spots around the North Shore for you to check out this summer. If we missed your favourite, let us know! No matter what vibe you’re looking for, we’re certain that you’ll find the perfect fit for you somewhere on the North Shore. Here’s our list below:\nTHE BEACH HOUSE RESTAURANT\nThis West Vancouver spot really has lived many lives. In it’s current configuration, the Beach House offers refreshing seafood with a stunning view of the ocean. In a heritage-designated building that was first built in 1912, this space has been a core aspect to the Dundarave community for decades. In 2010, Beach House moved in to take care of the space and contribute to its already-rich history and legacy.\nThe food and drink menu offers a unique West Coast dining experience, with a rotating seafood-centric menu and a grand selection of martinis and wine. Beach House continues to fulfill this heritage space’s legacy of being a welcoming space where guests are taken care of, and we’re certain you’ll agree once you’re out on the patio, looking out over the water and enjoying their Spicy Japanese Gyoza and Aburi Salmon Oshi Press during happy hour. You could also have a unique brunch here, if you choose to order the Crab Cake Benedict or the Coconut Berry French Toast.\nIf you’re looking for a fruity drink on the side, opt for the Cherry Espresso Martini, or maybe even the Raspberry Cosmopolitan. Maybe you can even go relax at Dundarave Beach, just a few steps away, after your meal.\n150 25th St., West Vancouver\nthebeachhouserestaurant.ca\nTAP & BARREL SHIPYARDS\nA classic and beloved destination for many, Tap & Barrel Shipyards is just steps away from the Lonsdade Quay Market, making it the perfect place to enjoy scenic views off the pier then go shopping on a satisfied, full stomach right after. Better yet, if you decide to visit on a Monday, you’ll enjoy happy hour no matter what time you decide to show.\nThis patio offers unobstructed views of downtown Vancouver, and the perfect spot for those who want a bustling scene with activity all around you. The only catch is you may have a difficult time deciding on a drink, because there’s a fine, quality selection of 36 B.C. craft beers on tap and 16 B.C. wines.\nTap & Barrel also has a well-rounded menu, which includes dishes from countless cuisines. You could go for a flavorful Caper Dill Salmon and grab some cumin-dusted nachos while you enjoy the hustle and bustle. If you’re a brunch fan, you can also enjoy patio season while getting a $4 discount on brunch items on weekends and holidays, as long as you make it before noon. You won’t regret ordering that mimosa in this relaxed environment.\n8 Lonsdale Ave., North Vancouver\ntapandbarrel.com/locations#shipyards\nRAGLAN’S BISTRO\nThis might just be one of the coolest patio spots in the North Shore. The Shipyard’s District has been home to Raglan’s since 1999, and the one promise this restaurant makes is that everyone will have a good time. If you’re looking for a vibrant setting with a beachy atmosphere and fun music, Raglan’s Bistro is a must-visit for you.\nFrom burgers to sauces, everything here is made in house, and the portions are generous. Raglan’s is good for anyone who may want fresh, casual, food in a friendly atmosphere while they can admire the bustling Lower Lonsdale view from a large patio.\nRaglan’s brunch menu has reopened specifically for patio season, and the list is extensive. You could grab a Ragtown Special, a Mexican Brunch Burrito, or even a Caramel Churros Waffle. At Raglan’s you can also opt for a brunch burger, homemade hot dog, or even a taco platter. While you’re out on the vibrant patio, enjoying your sizeable portions, you should also look into ordering one of Raglan Bistro’s beachy, colorful drinks. A special option would be to try one of Raglan’s Electric Teas. Either way, there’s a drink for everyone. After all, what could be better than a classic Pina Colada in your favorite beach-atmosphere patio?\n15 Lonsdale Ave., North Vancouver\nraglans.ca\nBURGOO BISTRO LONSDALE\nAt Burgoo Bistro, comfort is the top priority. At this bistro, you’ll feel right at home, and even more so if you’re out on the patio, sitting out by the sidewalk yet still close enough to the water to have great views of harbour life. This balanced setting is perfect for those who like to engage in people-watching every now-and-then.\nBurgoo Bistro offers a homey, countryside ambiance, and immerses you into a completely old-world vibe as you enjoy your favorite comfort meal. The earthy tones, stone walls, and vibrant greenery around you are bound to help you settle into the space almost immediately, feeling as though you’ve finally come back home after a timeless voyage.\nWhile you enjoy views of both the water and the streets and people around you, make yourself at home with some French Onion Soup and a delicious Lobster Mac & Cheese. For dessert, grab some classic comfort food by ordering warm mini doughnuts, with salted caramel sauce. You’ll be glad to hear that there’s also a great selection of both cocktails and mocktails. There’s the classic Margarita, the Boozy Blueberry Lemonade, and the Italian Boba Soda. Of course, it would be wrong not to mention Burgoo Bistro’s trademark Strawberry Lemonade as well. No matter what you order, you’ll be planning your next visit to Burgoo Bistro Lonsdale before you’ve even left.\n3 Lonsdale Ave., North Vancouver\nburgoo.ca\nKING TAPS AT LONSDALE QUAY\nThe brand new King Taps location in the North Shore just opened this May, and offers an incredible patio which overlooks the waterfront. While you’re there, you can enjoy the lively, friendly vibes and admire the local art and modern designs around you. The ambience will surely keep you energetic and excited to face the rest of your day, even after you’ve left.\nEat some of your favorite North American cuisine, while enjoying some regional wine on the side. For starters, grab some Bang Bang Shrimp and then immerse yourself in their delicious Italian-style cooking by ordering one of their delicious pizzas. Some of the most popular drinks include the Moonwalker and the Pink Flamingo. If you choose to visit King Taps during happy hour, which is two to five p.m. and nine to close daily, you can order a wine for half its price, or one of their many refreshing cocktails for $10. You could even get that Bang Bang Shrimp for $5 off its original price. All of this could be yours while you’re enjoying breezy views of the ocean, which we think is definitely a bonus.\nUnit 141 - 123 Carrie Cates Court, North Vancouver\nkingtaps.com\nARMS REACH BISTRO\nLocated in Deep Cove, this bistro started out as a small, family-run restaurant. Over time, Arms Reach Bistro has become an integral part of the North Vancouver community, and offers tasty meals with a lovely scenic view of the water.\nGoing on a Tuesday evening? You’re just in time for Burger & Beer Tuesday, where you can grab a feature burger of the day with a local craft beer for $22. Couldn’t make it for Tuesday, but are planning on Wednesday? You’re in luck, it’s Pasta and Pint Wednesday, and for $20, you can grab another local craft beer, this time with the feature pasta of the day. If you choose to visit on a Sunday for a nice weekend meal out on the water, Arms Reach Bistro will be having Cellar Sunday, where there’ll be 30 per cent off all bottles of wine from their reserve list.\nEven if you couldn’t make it for any of those special daily features, you’re guaranteed to leave Arms Reach Bistro satisfied any day of the week. Definitely go for their Chosty Caesar Salad, and follow that up with a delicious Spicy Spaghetti, or if you’re feeling handhelds, a B.C. Organic Beef Burger. Don’t forget about dessert; you can’t go wrong with a rich Espresso Chocolate Cheesecake.\n107c-4390 Gallant Ave., North Vancouver.\narmsreachbistro.com\nJOEY SHIPYARDS\nVery worthy of a mention, Joey at the Shipyards has plenty of patio space with a lovely view of the ocean and downtown Vancouver. There’s something for everyone here, and you’ll be immersed into a comfortable, yet elevated dining experience while you’re over at Joey.\nEvery Tuesday, you can grab up to 50 per cent off bottles of wine, and during happy hour, or if you’re looking for a late-night meal, you can opt for the Adult Happy Meal, which offers you three options: Truffle Fries and a Mini Martini, Roasted Corn Guacamole and a Margarita, or a Joey Cheeserburger and your choice of wine or beer.\nThere are tons of solid choices if you choose to dine at Joey Shipyards, whether you order the Spicy Crab Dip, the Truffle Udon Carbonara, or even a delicious Katsu Chicken Salad. If you’re looking for sushi, they’ve also got it: try the delicious Seared Salmon Sushi, and if you’re feeling fancy, order the Steak & Sushi meal. Dessert is a must here, as Joey serves both a salted caramel-chocolatey S’mores Ice Cream Pie and the Crème Brûlée Cheesecake, with passionfruit mango sauce, coconut crumble, and a delicious coconut whipped cream.\nYou can’t go wrong with Joey, and your meal will definitely taste better while you’re also enjoying some views of the ocean.\n125 Victoria Ship Way, North Vancouver\njoeyrestaurants.com\nFISHWORKS\nLooking for some sustainably sourced seafood with fresh ingredients? Look no further, we have the place for you. Fishworks offers a global culinary experience, providing you with both classic and contemporary cuisine, and you can experience this while in a stylish, comfortable patio located in a heritage building.\nTry out this site’s fine wine collection, or even grab a refreshing Lemon Drop or Jamaican Mule during Fishwork’s happy hour. Make sure you don’t miss out on the fresh shellfish offered here, whether it be the Baked Oysters or the Local Manila Clams. If you’re looking for seafood soup, you need to try Fishwork’s Clam Chowder, or surprise yourself with their soup of the day.\nFishworks offers a fresh take on seafood cuisine along with its sustainable, fresh ingredients. The Grilled Marinated Octopus makes for a great appetizer, and there’s a myriad of fish dishes to choose from. The B.C.
