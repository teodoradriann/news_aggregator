    "text": "ESTROPICIO descomunal el que la Copa Africana de Naciones, que es así como fue bautizada, el que le hace a los equipos europeos que cuentan con futbolistas de ese continente en sus planteles. Estropicio general de enormes dimensiones y estropicio en particular según miramos al fútbol según Sevilla, que va a verse capitidisminuido durante toda la cuesta de enero y parte de la de febrero, que también se presenta empinada.\nSenegal duda si convocar a Sabaly, un futbolista que casi ha jugado más con Senegal que con el Betis en todo el tiempo que estuvo en la plantilla verdiblanca. O sea que en este caso, el perjuicio sería menor, pero también perjuicio para la causa. Pero es la convocatoria marroquí la que más percute en los intereses de los nuestros, pues nada menos que tres futbolistas de calado se van de Sevilla a competir con su país a partir del día 17, fecha fijada para su debut con Tanzania.\nAnda el Sevilla luchando por lograr que su primer goleador, ese En-Nesyri tan importante en muchas de las conquistas sevillistas, pues jugar el día 4 ante un visitante tan fuerte como Athletic Club es vital, como ven vital los vascos el concurso del mayor de los Williams, también convocado por Ghana para este evento. Y si nos fijamos en el Betis, el daño es aún mayor, pues Marruecos se lleva a dos de una sola tacada y uno de los casos se antoja tremendamente perjudicial.\nSe lleva Marruecos a Chadi Riad y a Ez Abde, dos futbolistas importantes y que en el caso del central es perjuicio máximo. Los pocos efectivos que Pellegrini tiene para el vitalísimo puesto de defensa central se debilitan con la llamada a Chadi. No es de recibo este descalzaperros generalizado y que puede hacer recapacitar al fútbol para pensarse si fichar a futbolistas que cada dos años son utilizados durante un mes no por sus clubes, sino por sus países. ¿FIFA no tiene nada que decir?",

    "text": "FactFinder 12: Tips for a fraud-free New Year WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - All year long, FactFinder 12 has warned you about dozens -- and maybe even hundreds -- of same. As it turns out, online-purchase scams are putting you most at risk. The Better Business Bureau broke down what you can do to add to your New Year’s resolutions and have a fraud-free 2024. When shopping online, you always want to make sure you research the retailer before entering payment information. Do they have a working customer service number? Where is the company located? Will you make payments through a secure server? If all of these questions check out, you should also see if there have been any complaints of fraud from other people who have shopped on the website. Aside from online shopping sites, Facebook Marketplace is becoming a scammer favorite. That’s because they can get people to send them money on payment apps with little traceability, like Zelle or Cash App. Luckily, this scam is easy to avoid. If you haven’t met a seller or buyer face to face, don’t send them the money, no matter what they say is its purpose. Additionally, you should be wary of unsolicited emails from a person or company. Remember, scammers can make emails look like they’re from a legitimate business, government agency or reputable organization. Never click on links or open attachments in unsolicited emails.

    "text": "Study says 4,000 steps a day could help maintain brain health BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - Your watch might tell you you need to hit 10,000 steps a day, but researchers from the Pacific Neuroscience Institute Brain Health Center say getting even 4,000 steps can have benefits for brain health. They say this is especially true for those at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. They say exercising regularly – even if it’s just a small amount – can help people maintain their brain health. Rebecca Woolsey, a psychiatric nurse practitioner at CHI’s Archway Mental Health Services, said while exercise won’t cure Alzheimer’s, it’s likely one of the best preventative measures you can take. “When we’re treating dementia, there really aren’t good meds. So I think it becomes a little more important when we say, ‘Hey, look, this is our best shot,’ because it’s something that, really, we don’t have good treatments for,” Woolsey said. Woolsey said if walking doesn’t appeal to you, gardening, dancing and other forms of activity are beneficial as well. Copyright 2024 KFYR. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Doctor Hattori Tadashi examines a patient in Huế Eye Hospital in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province. VNA/VNS Photo\n Giving up a stable life in Japan and attractive offers from major hospitals, Prof. Dr. Hattori Tadashi, 60, decided to pursue the journey of bringing light to tens of thousands of poor people in Việt Nam.\nProf. Dr. Hattori Tadashi, CEO at Asia - Pacific Prevention of Blindness Association (APBA), is one of the leading experts in Japan in the field of treating eye fundus and lens diseases and also the world's leading surgeons with vitrectomy and Phaco (Phacoemulsification) surgery, which is the procedure to fragmentise the cloudy lens, remove it and then replace it with a proper artificial lens in order to restore your vision.\nIn 2022, doctor Tadashi was honoured to win the Ramon Magaysay Award, considered the \"Nobel Prize of Asia\". With these remarkable experiences and achievements, Tadashi could easily return to a stable life with high income in the \"land of cherry blossoms\".\nHowever, he decided to choose a difficult but meaningful path - the journey to bring light to the poor people of Việt Nam.\nHis life officially turned a new page after he decided to participate in a volunteer trip first planned to last three months in Việt Nam in April 2002. But what he witnessed in the country has kept him in this place until today.\nHe told baotintuc.vn that he was truly heartbroken by the fact that many people lost one eye a long time ago, and only when the other eye had a detached retina or could not see did they go to the hospital.\nThere were cases where surgeries were required but they insisted on refusing them because they could not afford the fees, Tadashi said.\nBecause of the lack of surgical supplies and equipment, many people had to live in darkness forever, which made him endlessly sad.\nFrom then on, he decided to spend all the money he had saved to buy an apartment to start carrying out his mission in Việt Nam.\nThe ophthalmologist always believes that no matter if there is only one blind patient, he will still be there to cure that patient. It is not necessary to have a very big house, the money to buy a house would be more meaningful if it could help many people see the light and have a normal life.\nFor that reason, over the years, he and his wife have continued to move to many places and live in rented houses to fulfil the mission of a physician, hoping to light up the beautiful lives of tens of thousands of Vietnamese patients.\nThe number of patients being helped gradually increased as the accumulated funds of Dr. Tadashi and his wife gradually dried up. To continue to fulfil his desire, over the years, he began to shuttle between Việt Nam and Japan. After days and hours of hard work in his country, he returned to Việt Nam with equipment and lenses to help poor people.\nOn weekends, the Japanese doctor and his Vietnamese colleagues come to mountainous and remote areas to perform surgery and treat people with cataracts and at risk of blindness.\nOver time, more and more ophthalmologists accompanied him on this volunteer journey, while many sponsors and organisations in Việt Nam and abroad began supporting his trips.\n“Poor people often easily accept living with illness without going to the hospital for treatment to save money. But doctor Tadashi was not afraid to go to far and difficult places to help patients get free surgery,” said Nguyễn Dũng, vice chairman of the Thừa Thiên-Huế People’s Committee.\n“That is very appreciable. If it weren't for doctor Tadashi, many poor people in Huế City would be committed to living the rest of their lives in darkness forever,\" he said.\nBuilding foundation for Huế Eye Hospital\nComing to Huế City more than 20 years ago, Tadashi learned a lot about the ophthalmology sector here and identified many urgent problems.\nAt that time, Huế Eye Centre (predecessor of Huế Eye Hospital) was only a small-scale medical facility with incomplete facilities and lacking equipment. The doctors had difficulty learning and receiving advanced techniques.\nSince then, every year, the Japanese doctor comes to Thừa Thiên-Huế Province 2 or 3 times, bringing hospital equipment, machinery and supplies that are donated from the Japanese Government.\nMany pieces of modern ophthalmic equipment are now used at Huế Eye Hospital such as phaco machine, ultrasound machine, surgical microscope and OCT retinal tomography machine.\nOn each trip, he not only directly participates in surgery on patients but also instructs and transfers techniques for doctors at the hospital.\nIn the early years, the professor transferred to ophthalmologists in the hospital the technique of phaco surgery for patients with cataracts.\nTo date, four doctors have mastered this surgical technique, bringing light to about 6,000 patients.\nGradually, Tadashi has updated the local doctors' examination, treatment and surgery methods for eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.\n“Professor Tadashi is one of the top 10 ophthalmologists performing vitreous retinal detachment surgery in the world today. He has made great contributions, laying a solid foundation to help Huế Eye Hospital become one of the four leading eye hospitals in the country,” said Phạm Minh Trường, the hospital’s director.\n“People in Huế City now do not need to go to Hà Nội or HCM City for treatment like before, but can have surgery with specialised and modern techniques at the hospital,” Trường said.\nRecently, Prof. Dr. Tadashi was honoured and awarded the title \"Honorary Citizen of Thừa - Huế Province” for his contributions to people's health and the development of ophthalmology in the locality.\nFor his great contributions in restoring the visual abilities of tens of thousands of Vietnamese people, he was also awarded the Friendship Medal by the President and an insignia \"For the People's Health” by the Ministry of Health.\nBehind the success and humanitarian journey of doctor Tadashi, it is impossible not to mention his wife Hoàng Thị Thanh Hoài who has accompanied him throughout his long journey over the past 20 years.\nHoài said: \"If he wants to do such precious things, I will always support and do my best.\"\nThe planned 3-month trip to Việt Nam in 2002 of doctor Tadashi has been extended for more than 20 years and will continue to be extended.\nHis non-stop trip has brought light to more than 60,000 Vietnamese people and remarkable advances in ophthalmic medicine for the country.

    "text": "By Noah Watson ,\n6 hours ago 12 years ago, Brian Klementowich was brought to his knees by drug addiction, sitting in a jail cell, arrested for illegally possessing a bottle of prescription medication.\nNow, he lives seven years clean of addiction and assumes the Production Supervisor / Plant Manager role at the Bainbridge A-1 Industries plant.\n“People talk about, ‘How do you measure success? Is it the man that has everything,’” Klementowich said. “Well, if it’s measured in distance, I got quite a lot of people beat.”\nKlementowich’s addiction started 19 years ago in the Marine Corps when he was 17. Klementowich did well early and was Meritoriously promoted after Boot Camp and Combat Training, reaching a Lance Corporal distinction. But he got involved with drugs soon after Combat Training and was eventually separated from the Military.\nHe moved back home with his family in Jacksonville, North Carolina, and spent a handful of years trying to “find his way,” bouncing from job to job until he was arrested in 2012.\n“I got caught with a bottle of pills that I wasn’t supposed to have,” Klementowich said. “I wound up in prison for two and a half years.”\nHe was forced to stay clean in prison, and said he learned a lot about respect and patience there. But prison didn’t cure his addiction, and Klementowich’s situation plummeted when he got out in 2014.\n“I did go back to drugs, and I actually went to harder drugs,” Klementowich said. “It got really bad… homelessness, heroin addiction, all of that, and I just got to the point where I couldn’t live that way no more. They call that rock bottom.”\nThat’s when a family friend recommended Plant A Seed Ministries, A faith-based rehabilitation center in Fort Pierce, FL. Klamentowich’s family drove him to the Florida institution, and he started a new chapter in his journey to sobriety.\n“My parents dragged me down there and dropped me off on the side of the road at this church,” Klementowich said. “There, I met the guy that I attribute my entire life to today. He saved my life. Without a doubt, I would not be here today without Albert Pigozzi.”\nPastor Albert Pigozzi is a Certified Recovery Peer Specialist and leads Plant A Seed Ministries. Klementowich said Plant A Seed was the most influential piece of getting clean. It was at Plant A Seed that Klementowich got involved with A-1 Industries.\nA-1 has a plant in Fort Pierce, and Klelmentowich and three others went to interview for jobs there. That’s when Klementowich met Bob Lamb, another person he said was instrumental in getting him to where he is now.\n“We went and interviewed, and [Lamb] was the guy that interviewed me,” Klementowich said. “I was the first one through, and I told him, ‘Look, I’m not going to lie. I have a terrible past, I’m just looking for a job. I promise you, if you give me a chance, I’ll come in here, and I’ll work my ass off, and I won’t make you regret it.”\nLamb gave him a chance.\n“I had a lot of mentors along the way in my recovery and in my life,” Klementowich said. “He was absolutely the biggest contributing factor to my career as far as mentors go.”\nKlementowich took the job but fell on hard times and found himself homeless soon after. He told Lamb his situation at work the next day, and Lamb put him up for three weeks in a hotel out of his own pocket.\nKlementowich was unable to find a place to live by the end of the three weeks and was forced to move back to North Carolina for a second time. He was there for six months before getting “homesick” for Florida and the community he had built in Fort Pierce. So, he hopped on a bus and made the trek back to the Sunshine State.\nHe went back to A-1, and Lamb rehired Klementowich on the spot. He then spent six years working and growing at A-1 before being considered for a move to the Bainbridge plant that was being built at the time.\n“Even knowing the dirty details of my past,” Klementowich said. “[A-1] never prevented me from progressing and climbing the ladder in this company.”\nFrom March to June of 2022, Klementowich traveled between Florida and Bainbridge to test the waters at the new plant. In July, they offered him a position.\n“I was questioning it,” Klementowich said. “Down south, I had my sober community and the people and the life that I had built that had helped me get and maintain my sobriety… I knew that I was going to have to commit fully or not at all.”\nKlementowich eventually decided to come to Bainbridge and made the move the very next day.\n“If it didn’t fit in the car, I sold it,” Klementowich said. “I sold the king-size bed, the TV… I packed up the car and got on the road and drove up here and was at work the next day.”\nKlementowich has been in Bainbridge ever since and has been able to maintain his sobriety. He said his mother is one of the most significant factors in that.\n“The thing that always comes to my mind is my mother’s peace,” Klementowich said. “I traumatized her, and I destroyed her for years. So many days, she didn’t know if the phone call she got was going to be, ‘Hey, your son’s dead,’ a knock on the door was going to be the cops… that was one of the biggest things that kept me going was knowing that she could sleep at night.”\nHe said another major factor is his relationship with Jesus Christ. He gave his life to Christ at Plant A Seed Ministries and said it has made a night and day difference in his life.\n“That brings me joy in places where I never knew I could have it before,” Klementowich said. “I just found peace.”\nThe post Brian Klementowich: working past his past to make a brighter future appeared first on The Post-Searchlight .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "“How We Killed 715 Terrorists”: DHQ Shares Details - The Nigerian military opened up on its operations in April as it vowed to end banditry and terrorism in the country - The Nigerian Defence Headquarters disclosed that 715 terrorists were killed and 465 hostages were rescued last month - The director of Defence Media Operation, Maj-Gen. Edward Buba, disclosed this at his biweekly media briefing on troops operational activities in the six geopolitical zones in the country Legit.ng journalist Esther Odili has over two years of experience covering [political parties](https://www.legit.ng/1197958-full-list-political-parties-nigeria-leaders.html) and movements. FCT, [Abuja](https://www.legit.ng/tags/abuja-city-news-today/) - The Nigerian Defence Headquarters (DHQ) said troops killed over 715 terrorists in April, while 465 kidnapped hostages were freed in the same period. As reported by The Punch, the feat, according to the military, was achieved through coordinated ground and air operations. The director of Defence Media Operation, Maj-Gen Edward Buba, made this known during a bi-weekly media briefing in Abuja on Thursday, May 2. According to him, operations in April included ambushes, raids, and fighting patrols, with aerial assets identifying and targeting terrorist leaders and their bases. Buba stressed the non-negotiable defeat of terrorist groups to prevent further harm to citizens. The military in [a post](https://twitter.com/DefenceInfoNG/status/1786054123437068391) sighted by Legit.ng on its website on Friday, May 3, disclosed further that the operation led to the arrest of 146 persons and the rescue of 465 kidnapped hostages. DHQ stressed that the [Nigerian troops](https://www.legit.ng/tags/nigeria-army/) recovered 32,971 assorted weapons and ammunitions and 16,121 barrels of oil during the period. “Tactically, whenever there is a clash between troops and terrorist on the ground, troops clearly win in the fire fight, though sadly in certain operations, casualties are sustained. “However, each and every engagement ends with troops victory, with several dead or surrendered terrorist in every location,” Buba said. Why DHQ released 313 terrorism suspects Meanwhile, Legit.ng earlier reported that the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) had said that the release of [the 313 terrorism suspects](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1585734-released-313-terrorism-suspects-nigerian-military-1-major-reason/) to the Borno state government was on the orders of the Federal High Court, Maiduguri division. The Director, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. Edward Buba, who made the clarification on Thursday, March 28, in Abuja, said the suspects were detained on suspicion, but no evidence was found against them at the conclusion of an investigation, [Daily Trust](https://www.legit.ng/tags/kebbi-state-news-today/) reported. According to him, the Federal Ministry of Justice prosecuted the cases, leading to the court’s decision to release them and their subsequent handover to the [Borno state](https://www.legit.ng/tags/borno-state-news-today/) government for further action.
