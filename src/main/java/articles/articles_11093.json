Este tiene un horario registrado que debe cumplir y es el encargado de valorar a los pacientes, determinar el estado en el que llegan y definir el tratamiento [de desintoxicación ](https://www.elimparcial.com/mxl/mexicali/2024/05/30/tiene-mexicali-54-centros-de-rehabilitacion-registrados-en-el-ipebc/)que llevarán”, señaló.\nIndicó que en el año se han realizado aproximadamente 140 visitas a centros de rehabilitación, de las cuales 30 derivaron en suspensiones, de un total de 288 centros registrados ante el IPEBC, de los cuales 191 ya cuentan con acreditación.\nUna de las principales problemáticas dentro de los centros de rehabilitación es la falta de constancia en los servicios médicos en aquellos que reciben pacientes en estado de intoxicación, además de la saturación de estos.\nEl tiempo de suspensión dependerá de la causa: si es por una falta administrativa, será temporal; si implica un riesgo al paciente, se aplicará una multa.\nSuspenden centro de rehabilitación Nueva Vida\nEl centro de rehabilitación Nueva Vida es uno de los que recientemente fue suspendido en Mexicali por la COEPRIS, así lo confirmó el titular. Esto ocurrió luego de que se presentara una denuncia por la muerte de un hombre.\nDenisse, pareja sentimental del hoy occiso, relató a La Crónica que acusó al centro de tener fallas en su operación, lo que ocasionó una omisión que costó la vida a su exesposo, padre de su hijo.\nSigue nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nRecibe las noticias más importantes del día.

    "title": "Bolzanini away from Valencia: «The city is in chaos» – News",
    "text": "BOLZANO. The strong wind, the incessant rain and the message from⁣ the ⁣Spanish ​government on ⁢all cell phones in ⁢the​ region: “Don’t leave your house.” ⁢For i Bolzanians on holiday‌ in Valencia for the Sharm​ week it ⁣was a shock. Locked⁤ in a hotel, they experienced the ⁣most dramatic days for ​Spain in recent decades.\n«The weather forecast was‌ rain, but we certainly never expected a storm of this type – he​ says Diana B ., returned on Wednesday ⁣- Fortunately our area, between the city of⁢ science and the sea,⁤ was less affected ​than the others”. She and her group were among the‍ few ⁤who managed to catch the​ flight home on Wednesday. Dozens were ⁣cancelled, ⁤plus, due to the flooded streets ⁣and the ⁣closed subway, it‍ was almost impossible to reach the⁢ airport.\nAnother Bolzano girl, Raffaella Less who returned yesterday from holidays⁣ in Valencia, took off ‍on⁣ the return plane and ⁣witnessed ⁤an ⁤apocalyptic​ scenario. «We saw all the ​flooded areas. In the city we didn’t realize the extent of the‌ disaster, ​also ⁣because the area around​ the port, where we were staying, was not particularly affected. We‌ felt the strong⁢ wind, yes. And in the night a terrible rain, never felt before. I ‌thought of Emilia Romagna.”\nOn Tuesday evening the group of holidaymakers from Bolzano were sitting at the restaurant table when, suddenly, all the phones in the room started⁢ ringing. ⁢It was the civil protection alert, activated at around 7.30pm, hours after the⁣ start of the disaster. «We⁣ all rushed out. – ‍says Raffaella Less – An absurd wind was blowing⁤ outside. We ‌heard ‌from citizens that ‍the⁤ largest floods occurred between ‌4 and 5 in the afternoon. ⁣The‌ alarm came much later… There must have been a flaw​ in ‌the system.”\nOn ‌the road, he explains, there were fallen trees, but nothing​ to suggest what was happening a ⁣few kilometers‌ further ​north. Public transport in⁢ the‌ city‌ immediately went haywire.‌ “We started ‌desperately ‍looking for a ‍taxi: ​we⁤ were all on the street trying to hail one,” says ⁣Less.\nMoving was ⁤also dramatic for Diana and her group. «We were ⁤supposed to⁤ catch the return flight at ⁢6pm on Wednesday. – he says – Finding a taxi was a challenge. The city was in complete chaos. Getting‌ to the airport was impossible, the drivers lied ⁣to the police at⁤ the checkpoint about ⁢where they were going,‌ because otherwise they would have sent them back. We were afraid of finding ourselves stuck along ⁢a ⁢flooded road.”\nChristian Alderucci a ⁢former hockey player⁢ from Bolzano, never ⁤made it to ⁣Valencia: he left yesterday on a ​flight from Italy and⁢ was landed as an emergency‌ in Malaga. A few hours later ​he decided to go back, like him many⁤ other Italians. “There were​ no means of transport to‍ reach Valencia – he said when reached by phone⁣ – I had to stay in Spain ⁤until Saturday, but it makes no sense to visit the city in those conditions”.⁤ Like everyone, he is shocked ⁤by the images broadcast by the international‍ media.\nInterview between‍ Time.news Editor ⁤and Weather Expert: Dr. Elena Torrens\nTime.news Editor: ⁣Good afternoon, Dr. Torrens. Thank you for joining⁢ us today. We’re here to discuss the recent ⁣severe weather event that struck Valencia, ⁣affecting many holidaymakers, including several from Bolzano. Can you first give us a brief⁤ overview of what caused‍ this unexpected storm?\nDr. Elena Torrens: ⁤ Good ‌afternoon! Absolutely, it’s great to be ‌here. The storms ⁢in Valencia were primarily ⁢caused by a combination ⁤of unusually warm sea temperatures and a​ low-pressure system that​ moved into‍ the area. This​ created a perfect storm scenario, leading to intense rainfall, strong winds, and ultimately⁤ flash flooding. While we can typically predict rain, storms of​ this​ magnitude⁢ are more challenging.\nTime.news Editor: It sounds⁤ incredibly alarming. We heard from travelers like Diana⁤ B. and Raffaella Less who experienced sudden alerts from the government to stay indoors. What typically triggers such alerts, ‌and was this response ‌timely enough?\nDr. Elena Torrens: ​ Civil protection alerts are usually triggered when the situation poses a significant threat to life and property. In this case, the alert came late relative to when the worst conditions began, as Raffaella mentioned. The response systems depend on real-time data and forecasts that unfortunately may not always align perfectly with the fast-changing conditions in⁢ severe weather events. In‍ this instance, the delayed warning ‍may have reflected a flaw‌ in the communication system between meteorological forecasts and civil authorities.\nTime.news Editor: That’s quite concerning. Raffaella shared that she thought of Emilia Romagna, likely referencing⁣ the ⁢devastating floods that impacted that region earlier. How do you assess the climate patterns in Spain, especially considering ⁢the potential for more intense weather ⁢events due to climate change?\nDr. Elena Torrens: You’re right to draw ⁤that connection. ⁣Spain, like many parts of the world, is​ experiencing changes ​in climate patterns, which contribute to more extreme weather events. Increased temperatures can lead to more moisture in​ the⁤ atmosphere, resulting⁢ in heavier ‍rainfall during storms. This is not just a localized issue; ⁢it’s a symptom of a global trend, and regions that traditionally weren’t prone to such severe weather are now vulnerable.\nTime.news Editor: That’s⁣ a sobering thought. What advice can you‍ give to travelers about staying safe during​ such unpredictable weather, especially when they are far from home?\nDr. Elena Torrens: My primary advice is to stay informed. Travelers should monitor reliable weather channels and local ⁤news for real-time updates. Additionally, having a plan in place, knowing the nearest evacuation routes,‌ and understanding local ‌emergency protocols can be vital. It’s also wise⁢ to⁢ have a few basic supplies on hand,‍ such ⁤as water and non-perishable food, just in case.\nTime.news‍ Editor: Excellent advice, Dr. Torrens. As we wrap ​up, how‍ can communities better prepare for and respond to these increasingly severe weather events in the future?\nDr. Elena Torrens: Communities⁣ need to invest‍ in robust infrastructure that can handle extreme weather, improve early warning systems, and enhance public‌ awareness campaigns concerning emergency preparedness. Collaboration with experts in meteorology and civil defense is crucial. Ultimately, fostering community resilience can greatly mitigate the impacts of such disasters.\nTime.news Editor: Thank you for your insights, Dr. Torrens. It’s crucial information for both travelers and communities. ​We ​appreciate your time and expertise today.\nDr.⁣ Elena Torrens: Thank you for having me. Stay safe, everyone!",

    "text": "A 300kg powerlifting goal that proved fatal for 17-year-old prodigy in Bikaner\nJaipur: Powerlifting champion Yashtika Acharya who died in a freak gym accident this week had one goal — to lift 300kg. The 17-year-old from Bikaner aimed for this milestone to help her bag another gold at the upcoming national championship in Jammu and Kashmir. Her drive to achieve the target was so intense it kept her in the gym for hours, pushing her to the limits at an age when most of her peers were still mulling over career choices.\nHer promising sporting career ended too soon, however, when the 270kg barbell slipped and crushed her neck during training Tuesday night.\nGanesh Acharya, owner of the Bikaner gym where the incident occurred, said Yashtika had unwavering focus. \"She wanted to reach the 300kg mark. In Oct 2024, she won gold at the National Equipped Bench Press Championship in Goa, lifting 250kg. The second runner-up in the junior category lifted about 200kg. This time, she was determined to break her own record in the tournament she planned to participate in next month,\" Acharya told TOI Thursday.\nYashtika's dedication and determination often meant sacrificing things most teenagers like her would cherish.

    "title": "Gov. Kathy Hochul Assures New Yorkers She's 'Stockpiling Abortion Medication'",
    "text": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is a true believer, even more liberal than her predecessor Andrew Cuomo. Earlier this year, when she heard about Florida's \"disgraceful and dangerous\" six-week abortion ban, she assured Floridians that New York would be their \"safe harbor\" where they could get an abortion at any time for any reason. News flash: People are fleeing New York and moving to Florida because they can't take it anymore. Hochul put out a graphic of the actions the governor's office was taking to protect the fundamental freedoms of New Yorkers, such as the right to bear arms. OK, we're just kidding about this one; instead, she brags about New York's gun control laws. And as far as protecting abortion access, the state is \"stockpiling abortion medication\" so they'll have plenty of \"medication\" on hand when Donald Trump bans the abortion pill in his nationwide abortion ban. New York is the birthplace of the women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental justice, and American labor movement.

    "title": "SpaceX has a plan for Starlink to reach Gigabit speeds",
    "text": "SpaceX is seeking approval for changes to Starlink that the company says will enable gigabits-per-second broadband service. in a application submitted to the US Federal Communications Commission on October 11, SpaceX claims The “requested modification and accompanying amendment will enable the Gen2 system to deliver gigabit-speed broadband, truly low-latency broadband, and ubiquitous mobile connectivity to all Americans and the billions of people around the world who still lack access to adequate broadband.\nSpaceX said it is pursuing “several small but significant updates to the orbital configuration and operating parameters for the authorization of its Gen2 space station to improve space sustainability, better respond to changing demand, and share spectrum more efficiently with other space users.” spectrum”.\nSpaceX wants to reduce the altitude of the satellites “from 525 km, 530 km and 535 km to 480 km, 485 km and 475 km altitude, respectively.” The reconfiguration will increase the “potential maximum number of orbital aircraft and satellites per aircraft” and keep the total planned number of second-generation satellites at 29,988 or less. The FCC so far approved 7,500 Gen2 satellites.\nElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX wrote On Monday, “next-generation Starlink satellites, which are so large that only Starship can launch them, will enable a 10-fold increase in bandwidth and, with reduced altitude, faster latency.”\nSpaceX promised gigabit speeds in 2016, when the satellite system was just in the planning stages and didn’t even have a name yet. “Once fully optimized through final deployment, the system will be able to provide high bandwidth (up to 1 Gbps per user) and low-latency broadband services to consumers and businesses in the US and around the world.” SpaceX told the FCC in November 2016.\nAs for actual speeds in 2024, Starlink website says that “users typically experience download speeds between 25 and 220 Mbps, with most users experiencing speeds greater than 100 Mbps. Upload speeds are typically between 5 and 20 Mbps. Latency ranges from 25 to 60 ms on land, and more than 100 ms in certain remote locations.”\nChange satellite elevation angles Another request would change satellite elevation angles to improve network performance, SpaceX said. “SpaceX is seeking to reduce its minimum elevation angle from 25 degrees to 20 degrees for satellites operating between 400 and 500 kilometers altitude,” SpaceX told the FCC. “Reducing the minimum elevation angle in this way will improve customer connectivity by allowing satellites to connect directly to more ground stations and maintain connections with ground stations for a longer period of time while flying overhead.”\nMeanwhile, upgrades to Starlink’s Gen2 satellites “will feature improved hardware that can utilize higher gain and more advanced beamforming and digital processing technologies and provide more targeted and robust coverage for U.S. consumers,” SpaceX said. .\nSpaceX is also seeking more flexible use of spectrum licenses to support its planned mobile service and current home Internet service. The company requested permission “to use Ka, V and E band frequencies for fixed or mobile satellite use cases where the US or International Frequency Allocation Table allows such dual use and where the antenna parameters would be indistinguishable.” “.",

    "title": "Pioneer Press Player of the Year: Tartan's CJ Banks",
    "text": "Ask C.J. Banks what drew him to basketball, and he won’t hesitate to answer.\n“The competitiveness,” he said. “That’s why I love it.”With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that the 5-foot-11 guard was such a big-game hunter for Tartan throughout his high school career.The game that will always stick in Titans coach Mark Klingsporn’s mind is the team’s section semifinal upset of East Ridge last year, when Banks was a junior. The guard dropped 24 points to snap the Raptors’ 16-game winning streak.“He was utterly fantastic,” Klingsporn said. “And he really needed to be for us to pull that off. … We wouldn’t have been even close without how great he played in that game.”The coach noted that game revealed to many just how special Banks was, and could be. The guard provided further additional evidence in his senior season.Banks — the Pioneer Press East Metro Boys Basketball Player of the Year — averaged 18.7 points and 5.5 assists while leading Tartan to a 27-1 season.The latter number is the one that matters to Banks.“I love winning,” he said.He was the primary reason Tartan did so much of it this season. Banks is a crafty guard who can shoot the lights out and score from three levels while changing speeds and direction to generate advantages.That combination allowed Banks to put up big numbers effectively on demand. Yet Klingsporn noted there were also games when the guard would score only 10 points, because that’s all that was required to win.The guard’s biggest development this season was as a leader. Tartan heavily featured a pair of freshmen this season. Banks took the younger players under his wing and made a point to emphasize communication.But he also led with his approach.“Team is the most important thing for him,” Klingsporn said. “And it was, quite frankly, for a lot of our kids, and that’s why we were really good together. We had a bunch of selfless kids.”Banks noted this year’s team “loved to play together.”“Everybody liked each other,” he said. “We were all unselfish. And it just helped us.”But Banks was the head of the snake.Throughout high school, he gained more and more understanding of how to play with proper tempo and controlled games on a nightly basis. That allowed Tartan to win its first 27 games of the season and become a top-five team in Class 4A. The Titans’ lone loss was a five-point loss in the Class 4A, Section 4 final to Cretin-Derham Hall, the top team in the state.The Titans put a thorough scare into the Raiders, leading by 13 at the break. Banks finished with 26 points.“He was really good. He gave us a fighting chance in that game to beat that team,” Klingsporn said. “We fought them tooth and nail.”What else would you expect from a guy who always seemed to deliver his best in the biggest moments? Banks’ incremental progression was a product, Klingsporn noted, of who the guard is as a person.“He’s a high-character kid. He allows himself to be coached. He’s a selfless kid. If you allow yourself to be coached, you’re a selfless kid and you’re a good teammate, those are three things that really stick out to me,” Klingsporn said. “You’re going to allow yourself to progress as a basketball player, because there’s nothing blocking you from not progressing, as long as you’re putting the time in.”The guard is highly appreciative of the support and teaching he has received from Klingsporn. Banks remains uncommitted to a college program, but Klingsporn noted he is garnering interest.Banks knows what he wants from his next program.“Just a coach who’s straight up with me, who has a plan for me,” he said.Because he knows how helpful that was for his development at the high school level.“Quite frankly, I think people have made a mistake in not recruiting him higher,” said Klingsporn, who has developed a number of Division-I players during his hall of fame, 700-plus win coaching career. “He’s the type of kid that every coach really wants to have on their team.”Tommy Ahneman, senior center, Cretin-Derham Hall: Notre Dame commit averaged 18 points, 11 rebounds and 3.5 blocks for the top team in Class 4A.Jojo Mitchell, junior guard, Cretin-Derham Hall: Playmaker averaged 17 points and six assists while guiding the Raiders to state.Ty Schlagel, sophomore wing, Cretin-Derham Hall: The state’s top recruit in the Class of 2027, he averaged 19 points and seven rebounds as a sophomore this season.Cedric Tomes, junior guard, East Ridge: All-around player averaged 27 points a game for the Raptors.Camare Young, junior guard, Apple Valley: Lengthy wing averaged north of 18 points and nine rebounds while leading the Eagles back to state.",

    "text": "WOODSTOCK, CT ( WFSB /Gray News) - Fourteen puppies were rescued from a rollover crash that closed a road in Woodstock, Connecticut Thursday morning. Several fire agencies responded to Senexet Road between Laurel and Bull Hill roads for a single-vehicle rollover accident involving wires down. Firefighters found a pole that had snapped, with wires down, and called Eversource CT to disable the power. Power was out in the area while the electricians worked. Officials say minor injuries were originally reported, but no one ended up being hurt. First responders also rescued and provided care for 14 puppies at the scene. the Muddy Brook Fire Department shared photos on Facebook of firefighters interacting with the puppies. The Necogg Humane Society and a doctor from Peake Brook Veterinary Center responded to the scene to provide veterinary care and shelter to the animals, firefighters said. Some puppies will be taken to a veterinary office for further care. Drivers were warned to expect a “long duration road closure.” Copyright 2024 WFSB via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
