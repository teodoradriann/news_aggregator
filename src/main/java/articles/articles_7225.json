    "title": "Suns Get a 7-Foot Center in Trade With Hornets",
    "text": "The Phoenix Suns added height to the lineup on Jan. 15 with the addition of center Nick Richards as part of a two-player\ntradewith the Charlotte Hornets that also involved draft picks.Richards gives the Suns (19–20) a fourth 7-footer, which will bolster the team around the basket, especially in the rebound department for a team that’s 25th in the league in rebounds per game. The Suns, who also received a future second-round pick, sent guard Josh Okogie and three future second-round picks to the Hornets (9–28).\nRichards, 7-foot-0, has averaged a double double this season for the Hornets with 11.3 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. He’s also a solid shot blocker with 1.7 blocks per contest.\nSuns center Jusuf Nurkic, 7-foot-0, had been the main big man this season with 8.6 points and 9.2 rebounds in 23 starts before head coach Mike Budenholzer benched him last week. In addition, Nurkic hasn’t played a full season his entire 12-year career, and already had an ankle injury in November.\n“He’s a pro, so he’s gotta be ready,” Budenholzer\ntoldthe media on Jan. 11. “Everybody’s earning their minutes.”Phoenix also has two backup 7-foot centers in rookie Oso Ighodaro, 7-foot-0, and Bol Bol, 7-foot-3, but neither play major minutes. Richards averaged 21 minutes per game with the Hornets.\nIghodaro plays 16.8 minutes per game, which includes just two starts in 32 games played. He averages 4.2 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.\nBol has played 6.1 minutes per game thus far in eight game appearances with 3.5 points and 1.5 rebounds per contest. The sixth-year veteran from Oregon has played in 43 or fewer games every season except 2022-2023, when he played 70 games with the Orlando Magic.\nPhoenix also has a 6-foot-10 center in Mason Plumlee, who took minutes over Nurkic last week. Plumlee averages four points and 6.4 rebounds in 17.9 minutes per game.\nBesides Nurkic and Plumlee, only forwards Kevin Durant and Royce O’Neale average more than five rebounds per game. After that, no one averages more than 3.8 boards per game other than guard Devin Booker.\nPhoenix came into the season with big expectations because of recent success and stars such as Booker and Durant. The Suns have won 45 or more games in each of the past four seasons, but this year’s squad is already hovering around the loss total for two of those seasons.\nCharlotte can build for the future with Okogie and the three second-round picks. Okogie averaged six points and 2.9 rebounds per game in 25 games and one start with the Suns.\nWhile Okogie played 14 minutes per game, the Suns have the backcourt depth to fill the void. Besides Booker, guards Bradley Beal and Tyus Jones both log more than 30 minutes per game. Grayson Allen plays 23.9 minutes per game, and he’s provided a spark off the bench with 10.9 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game.\nBefore the trade, Phoenix got a couple of looks at Richards earlier this season in two games against the Hornets. The first time on Jan. 7, Richards put up 15 points, 12 rebounds, and three blocked shots in a 115–104 win over the Suns. He had a quieter game on Sunday with four points and five rebounds in 18 minutes during a 120–113 win by the Suns.\nRichards had a three-year, $15 million deal with the Hornets, and the Suns will take a salary cap hit of $5 million this season and next with the trade. Okogie had a two-year, $16 million contract with the Suns, and the Hornets will take an $8.25 million cap hit this season and a $7.75 million cap hit the following season.",

    "text": "Germania, allarme terrorismo per Natale e Capodanno. Controlli nella Cattedrale di Colonia\nMondo\nSecondo quanto appreso dai media tedeschi, i bersagli potrebbero includere anche le funzioni religiose di Vienna e Madrid. La cellula sotto osservazione sarebbe legata allo Stato islamico della provincia di Khorasan\nLe forze di sicurezza della Germania (ma anche di Austria e Spagna) hanno ricevuto indicazioni secondo cui una cellula terroristica islamista \"potrebbe pianificare diversi attacchi in Europa\" a Natale o la notte di Capodanno. Come appreso dall'agenzia tedesca Dpa, il gruppo sotto osservazione potrebbe essere legato all'Isis-K, ossia lo Stato islamico della provincia di Khorasan. I bersagli, stando a quanto emerge, potrebbero includere le funzioni religiose di Natale a Colonia, Vienna e Madrid. Già in corso controlli nella Cattedrale della città tedesca. E stando a quanto riporta la Bild, sono stati effettuati alcuni arresti da parte di unità speciali in Germania e a Vienna.\nControlli nella Cattedrale di Colonia\nNella serata di sabato 23 dicembre è partita un'operazione su larga scala presso la Cattedrale di Colonia. La polizia è intervenuta con cani anti-esplosivo per assicurarsi che nella chiesa non siano già stati collocati oggetti pericolosi. A confermare l'attività di controllo è stato il capo della polizia di Colonia, Michael Esser: \"Anche se la soffiata si riferisce alla notte di Capodanno, stasera faremo tutto il possibile per garantire la sicurezza dei visitatori della cattedrale durante la vigilia di Natale\". Dopo l'intervento dei cani in seguito alla messa serale, la Cattedrale è stata \"chiusa a chiave. Domani, 24 dicembre, tutti i visitatori saranno controllati prima di entrare in chiesa\".\n<a href=\"https://tg24.sky.it/cronaca/2023/12/22/capodanno-2024-allerta-terrorismo-viminale\">\n</a>",

    "title": "Donald Trump Makes Absolutely Wild Claim About Joe Biden And Catholics",
    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\nDonald Trump accused President Joe Biden of overseeing a Soviet-style persecution of Catholics and claimed FBI undercover spies are about to infiltrate the churches. (Watch the video below.)\nBiden has described himself as a “ practicing Catholic ,” and is just the second Catholic president after JFK. But that didn’t stop the GOP front-runner from launching dubious allegations at his probable adversary in the 2024 election.\nAdvertisement “Under Crooked Joe Biden, Christians and Americans of faith are being persecuted like nothing this nation has ever seen before,” Trump said in the video posted to Truth Social on Thursday.\n“Catholics in particular are being targeted and evangelicals are surely on the watch list as well. Over the past three years, the Biden administration has sent SWAT teams to arrest pro-life activists. The FBI has been caught profiling devout Catholics as possible domestic terrorists and planning to send undercover spies into Catholic churches, just like in the old days of the Soviet Union.”\nA leaked FBI memo titled “Interest of Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists in Radical-Traditionalist Catholic Ideology Almost Certainly Presents New Mitigation Opportunities” was interpreted by some conservatives to mean that the Justice Department was generally targeting Catholics as domestic terrorists. Attorney General Merrick Garland called the accusation “outrageous ” and said he was appalled by the memo. “Any characterization that the FBI is targeting Catholics is false,” the bureau said to Newsweek on Friday.\nAs for arrests of pro-life activists that Trump referred to, he may have been referring to action against alleged extremists that conservatives seemed to spin into a false narrative about a war against the religious right, as HuffPost reported in 2022.\nAdvertisement One of the suspects, Mark Houck, was acquitted of federal charges in January 2023.\nIn his new video plea, Trump also urged Catholics not to vote for Biden or any other Democrat and promised to form a task force against “anti-Christian bias.” The task force would also “look at government agencies, universities, and major corporations that have adopted anti-Christian diversity, equity and inclusion programs.”\nIn comments made in 2021 nearly a year after his 2020 defeat to Biden, Trump complained about losing ungrateful Catholic supporters for that election. “I did a lot for the Catholics. I’m a little bit surprised that we didn’t do better with the Catholic vote,” Trump said . He added at one point he was “very optimistic that we’re going to be back.”\nDonald Trump, deep in the throes of mental decline, claims that devoutly Catholic President Biden wants to send \"undercover spies\" into Catholic churches.\nWhen people accuse President Biden of being too old, show them this. pic.twitter.com/dPpHDBSysl\n— Really American 🇺🇸 (@ReallyAmerican1) December 22, 2023 Related Donald Trump Joe Biden Catholicism Related Donald Trump Joe Biden Catholicism Before You Go\nRon Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?

    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — One of the most iconic figures in the history of women’s soccer is getting the honor she rightfully deserves.\nPortland Thorns FC announced that legendary forward Christine Sinclair will be the first-ever inductee into the Thorns Hall of Fame. The club will honor Sinclair’s incredible legacy during a special pre-match ceremony on Saturday, October 4, at Providence Park, ahead of the Thorns' match against Bay FC.\nSinclair's name is synonymous with Portland soccer. From captaining the Thorns since their inaugural season in 2013 to leading the team to an unmatched list of accomplishments, her impact on and off the field is immeasurable. Under her leadership, the Thorns won three NWSL Championships (2013, 2017, 2022), two NWSL Shields (2016, 2021), the 2021 NWSL Challenge Cup, the Women’s International Champions Cup, and the 2020 Fall Series.\nAcross 12 seasons in Portland, Sinclair cemented herself as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 79 goals in all NWSL competitions—second-most in league history. She also holds franchise records in appearances (237), starts (215), minutes played (18,579), and penalty kick goals (10), along with 19 assists, ranking third in Thorns history.\nSinclair’s achievements stretch far beyond Portland. Representing Canada, she appeared in six FIFA Women’s World Cups, four Olympic Games—including a historic gold medal run in Tokyo 2021—and captured continental titles in the Concacaf Women’s Championship and the Pan American Games. With 190 international goals, Sinclair holds the world record for most goals scored by any player, male or female.\nHer accolades include 14 Canada Soccer Player of the Year awards, eight FIFA World Player of the Year nominations, and upcoming inductions into both the Canada Soccer Hall of Fame and Canada Sports Hall of Fame in 2025.\nSinclair’s connection to Portland dates back to her college days, when she starred at the University of Portland. There, she won two national championships (2002, 2005), scored a school-record 110 goals, and took home the MAC Hermann Trophy twice as the top collegiate player in the nation.\nBefore her time in the NWSL, Sinclair built a decorated pro career that included WPS championships with FC Gold Pride and the Western New York Flash, and club stints in Vancouver that laid the foundation for her remarkable rise.\nNow, with her playing career complete, Sinclair becomes a permanent part of Thorns history—forever a legend, forever a Thorn.",

    "text": "An amber weather warning for snow and ice for most of Wales has been issued for this weekend by the Met Office.\nIt is the second highest level of warning and is in effect from 18:00 GMT on Saturday until midday on Sunday, with warnings of travel disruption.\nThe counties affected are Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea, Torfaen, Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham.\nThere is also a yellow snow and ice warning for the whole of Wales from midday on Saturday until the end of Sunday.\nThe Met Office warns that:\nPower cuts may occur, which could affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage Travel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers Some road closures and longer journey times possible Some delays and cancellations to bus, rail and air travel are likely Rural communities could become cut off Untreated pavements and cycle paths likely to be impassable Northern Lights dazzle in first display of 2025 Cardiff council urged drivers to be careful because of the \"big freeze\" and said it would be using up to 60 tonnes of grit each night to keep the city moving.\nThe roads that are being prioritised are all A roads and priority bus routes, the majority of B roads, some C roads and other non-classified roads\nIt said there were also 400 salt bins across the city for residents to use.\nWhat might happen after snow in Wales? Met Office The Met Office said 3-7 cm of snow was likely for much of the warning area, with 15-30 cm on higher ground Welsh Water said it was distributing free winter lagging kits - insulation and a tap jacket - to prevent pipes freezing and bursting.\nThe company also suggested residents find their stop tap in case pipes burst so the water can be turned off to minimise damage.\nIt also said clearing gutters can prevent excess water entering homes, and fixing dripping taps can decrease the risk of frozen pipes.\nEmpty buildings are at particular risk, it said, and suggested stopping the tap and draining the system so there is no water to freeze.\nPublic Health Wales has issued cold weather advice and guidance ahead of the weekend weather warnings on its social media channels.\nGritting lorries will be out across Wales making the roads safe",

    "text": "A pesar de que esta misma semana el gobierno municipal anunció que no está en el panorama recortes importantes para el sistema de educación pública , un grupo de padres y representantes de la ciudad de Nueva York rechazados del 3-K, dicen lo contrario . Este jueves entregaron 6,000 peticiones al alcalde Eric Adams , exigiendo los puestos que les prometieron.\nA través del programa 3-K for All del Departamento de Educación de la Ciudad de Nueva York (DOE), las familias pueden enviar una solicitud en el año calendario, en que su hijo cumpla tres años, pero como se advierte claramente en las aplicaciones, “ en algunos distritos escolares, los puestos son limitados”\nMás de 2,500 familias se quejaron que no recibieron un puesto en un centro de cuidado 3-K , a pesar de las repetidas promesas de que serían beneficiarias de uno.\nEn este sentido, un grupo de padres también realizó una manifestación este jueves frente a la Alcaldía, para pedir la restauración de los recortes en Pre-K y 3-K, el restablecimiento de equipos de extensión y la expansión de asientos gratuitos, para incluir el día y el año completo, a todos los niños menores de 5 años.\n“La Ciudad recortó los fondos de 3-K y Pre-K, desmanteló los equipos de extensión de 3-K, no pagó a los operadores y se negó a pagar la expansión de 3-K” , denunció la organización New Yorkers United for Child Care (NYUC) .\nDe acuerdo con un reporte compartido por NYUC, uno de los motivos por los cuales la clase trabajadora de color, está dejando la ciudad, son por los altos costos del cuidado infantil. (Foto: Gerardo Romo) A los padres y miembros de NYCU se unieron la Federación Unida de Maestros, funcionarios electos locales, United Neighborhood Houses, All Our Kin, Chinese American Planning Council y Grand Street Settlement.\n“Miles de familias de clase trabajadora están abandonando los cinco condados y el poco acceso a estos servicios esenciales, tienen que ver con esta tendencia. Necesitamos estas restauraciones, para garantizar que las familias desatendidas sepan cómo y dónde acudir para estos programas, y una verdadera garantía de cuidado infantil para todos los niños menores de 5 años, incluida programación de día completo y durante todo el año”, reclamó la concejal de Brooklyn, Alexa Avilés.\nUn segundo alquiler Entre las manifestantes, se encontraba Meagan Dobrijevic, madre de un niño de 3 años de Astoria, quien detalló que el 16 de mayo, descubrió que su hija no obtuvo su añorado puesto en 3K.\n“Cuando me enteré, estaba en el trabajo y mi corazón se hundió porque no tenía un plan de respaldo porque no creía que lo necesitara. Gastamos $20,000 al año en cuidado infantil y por eso hemos estado contando con 3K y PreK para liberar nuestras finanzas familiares y poder tomar la decisión de tener otro hijo. Ahora parece, que han tomado la decisión por nosotros”, compartió.\nLa concejal de Queens, Tiffany Cabán, recordó que miles de familias de color de clase trabajadora se están viendo obligadas a abandonar la ciudad de Nueva York, porque el cuidado infantil, puede ser tan caro como un segundo alquiler.\n“El alcalde Adams puede y debe ofrecer los programas universales de 3-K y Pre-K que se prometieron a los neoyorquinos. Es absolutamente inaceptable hacer retroceder estos programas” , remató.",
