    "text": "The federal government is planning to sharply cut the low-wage stream of the temporary foreign worker program back to prepandemic levels, government sources say, amid criticism of its growing use by Canadian employers. Reliance on the low-wage stream has shot up since 2022, when Ottawa agreed to ease access to the program in response to calls from restaurant owners and other employers who said they were struggling to find staff after months of pandemic restrictions. The 2022 changes included increasing the cap on the proportion of low-wage temporary foreign workers that an employer can hire to 20 per cent, or even 30 per cent in some sectors such as accommodation and food services, up from 10 per cent. It also shelved a rule that barred employers in retail and hospitality from hiring certain low-wage workers when the local unemployment rate was 6 per cent or higher. Federal Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault announced several measures and proposals last week that he said were aimed at reducing the use of temporary foreign workers in Canada, including higher fees and stronger enforcement of caps. Government records show Ottawa approved 83,643 temporary foreign worker positions in the low-wage stream in 2023, up from 28,121 in 2019 prior to the pandemic. Two senior government officials told The Globe and Mail Wednesday that the announcement should be viewed as the initial steps, with more moves to come. The Globe is not identifying the two officials as they were not authorized to comment publicly on the plans. The timing of when further restrictions will be announced has not been decided, they said. The temporary foreign worker program was singled out for criticism in a recent [United Nations report](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-temporary-foreign-workers-slavery-un-report/), which described it as a “breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery.” Business groups are pushing back this week on that criticism, rejecting the UN report as an over-the-top analysis that plays down the fact that the vast majority of placements are successful. Immigration has emerged as a top political issue, with [ Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/pierre-poilievre/) regularly accusing the Liberal government of mismanaging the file, leading to countrywide housing pressures. He has vowed to link annual immigration targets to the number of homes being built. Mr. Poilievre has also criticized the government’s handling of the temporary foreign worker program, saying it should not be used to suppress Canadian wages. During the first quarter of 2024, employers [ received government approval](https://theglobeandmail.com/business/article-temporary-foreign-workers-employment/?_gl=1*az57pu*_gcl_au*MTM3NjY1NjczLjE3MTYzMDc3ODEuMzM4OTk4OTIzLjE3MTYzMDc3ODYuMTcxNjMwNzgyMQ..*_ga*MTY5MTkxNDMyLjE3MTYzMDc3ODA.*_ga_DH5MGZVVNS*MTcyMzQ4NDg4Ny4xODkuMS4xNzIzNDg2MzI1LjYwLjAuMA..*_fplc*ZDFwMkxEZUJvSiUyRjVvaCUyQkp1JTJGcCUyRkpqNkdNbSUyQk4lMkZvZEFTUlljRW5OOCUyRmFZY2pQbHhQTUw2MXVUS3o4S3ppdENUZGRsN21HbnU2eFlqOFNCZGhwRXhabCUyRk9wMVhjTk9KNzRQdzVobFpBVE9QejdsdHQwUmNwSHB6WjR2dWhnUSUzRCUzRA..) to hire 28,730 people through the low-wage stream of the temporary foreign worker program, an increase of 25 per cent from a year earlier, according to figures from Employment and Social Development Canada. Statistics Canada reported last month that the job vacancy rate declined to 3.1 per cent in May, 2024, in line with prepandemic levels, after reaching a peak of 5.7 per cent in early 2022. Business leaders acknowledge that labour shortages are not as dire as they were two years ago, but insist that the low-wage stream should continue in some form. “The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is very supportive of addressing the misuse of the program,” said Diana Palmerin-Velasco, the chamber’s senior director for the future of work. “But that doesn’t mean that the existence of the program – that is vital for so many sectors of the economy – is a problem.” Ms. Palmerin-Velasco said critics fail to appreciate the fact that the program is often used to fill job vacancies in regions of the country that do not have a large pool of available labour. She also takes issue with the assumption that employers are hiring foreign workers to save money, noting that employers are on the hook for travel and other expenses. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said temporary foreign worker programs have been around for decades and have frequently been tightened or loosened over the years based on evolving labour-market needs. He said the government’s moves to ease access to the program in 2022 were entirely justified at the time. “There’s absolutely no question that coming out of the pandemic, the labour market was broken. There were hundreds of thousands of vacant positions, particularly in lower-skilled occupational categories, that desperately needed filling,” he said. Mr. Kelly said he understands that Ottawa is now under pressure to cap access to the low-wage stream, but also urged the government to find the right balance. “The challenge for government is I think most of them know that the politically popular solution is at odds with the economically viable solution,” he said. “Yes, the labour market has cooled a bit in Canada, but if we take out the temporary foreign worker program, then you better not complain about the line at the local restaurant or the increase in menu prices.” Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor of business, economics and public policy at Western University who has previously advised the Liberal cabinet, said the 2022 changes went too far. He said reducing the use of the temporary foreign worker program would be good for wages in Canada, would help students find work and would encourage businesses to innovate. He said he questions why fast-food restaurants in college towns such as London, Ont., are using the program. “We’ve got thousands of students, thousands of international students, and we can’t find somebody to work at a Dairy Queen next to a college? It just doesn’t seem reasonable to me,” he said. “I think we have lost the plot here.” With reports from Matt Lundy in Toronto",

    "text": "[Monde](//www.rts.ch/info/monde/) En deuil et désertée par les pèlerins, la ville de Bethléem ne fêtera pas Noël comme d'habitude L'église de la Nativité, inscrite au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco, attire d'ordinaire des centaines de milliers de touristes. Mais cette année, pas de hordes de pèlerins ni de faux pères Noël. Pas de selfies la tête coiffée de bonnets rouges et blancs, pas de sapins ni d'illuminations. Les hôtels sont vides quand ils ne sont pas fermés et les autorités religieuses ont renoncé à toute célébration \"inutilement festive\", en solidarité avec les Palestiniens qui souffrent à Gaza. Une décision aussi prise en raison de la situation en Cisjordanie, qui a également connu une flambée de violences. Depuis le 7 octobre, plus de 290 Palestiniens y ont été tués par les forces israéliennes ou des colons, selon des chiffres émis par des responsables palestiniens. La municipalité de Bethléem limitera donc Noël \"aux stricts rituels chrétiens\", comme la messe de minuit. Des conséquences économiques Cette situation a déjà d'importantes conséquences économiques. Pour les commerçants, la période de Noël représente souvent les trois quarts du chiffre d'affaires annuel. Dans l'atelier d'une boutique de souvenirs spécialisés dans les articles religieux en bois, des mages et des bergers à moitié terminés veillent sur des postes de travail désespérément vides. A quoi bon embaucher: de toute façon, \"Bethléem est bouclée de toute part\", lance Jack Giacaman, responsable de la production. Mur de séparation entre Israël et la Cisjordanie occupée, points de passage vers Jérusalem et l'aéroport difficiles à franchir... gagner la ville de Bethléem où vivent ensemble chrétiens et musulmans est devenu très compliqué. >> Réécouter à ce sujet le reportage de La Matinale: Le narratif israélien pointé du doigt La désertion des pèlerins serait aussi due à la rhétorique effrayante des dirigeants israéliens, estime Fadi Kattan. Ce chef cuisinier franco-palestinien s'indigne du cliché des \"Palestiniens tous dangereux\". \"C'est comme s'il y avait une ligne invisible qui empêchait les pèlerins de s'aventurer hors des sentiers balisés\", à cause de ce que leur disent les tours opérateurs israéliens, déplore-t-il sur la terrasse d'une maison qui appartenait déjà à son arrière-grand-père. Plus que jamais pourtant, selon le prêtre grec orthodoxe Issa Thaljieh, il serait nécessaire de confronter les visiteurs à la réalité quotidienne des Palestiniens. Visiter les lieux saints, c'est bien, \"mais le plus important\" dit-il, c'est \"de découvrir comment on survit comme dans une prison\" sur un territoire occupé par Israël depuis la guerre israélo-arabe de 1967. \"Parfois on vient me voir à la boutique en me disant: je suis heureux d'être à Bethléem, en Israël\", rappelle Jack Giacaman en évoquant des touristes peu au fait de la situation locale. \"J'attendrais pour voir comment ça va tourner\" Sensibiliser les visiteurs à la cause palestinienne? Même quand les armes sont baissées, Fadi Kattan, qui possède deux adresses à Bethléem et dans le quartier londonien de Notting Hill, demeure sceptique. \"C'est triste à dire et c'est un désastre pour Bethléem, mais si j'étais un pèlerin américain entendant tout ça, j'attendrais quelques mois pour voir comment ça va tourner\", conclut-il. afp/ther",

    "text": "La sanità fanese al centro del Consiglio regionale: merito di due atti, uno a firma di Renato Claudio Minardi (Pd)...\nLa sanità fanese al centro del Consiglio regionale: merito di due atti, uno a firma di Renato Claudio Minardi (Pd) sulla sospensione del day hospital oncologico nella giornata di sabato, e l’altro da Marta Ruggeri (5 Stelle) sulla mancata previsione di posti letto per la creazione di un centro residenziale per malati di Alzheimer . \"Il servizio di day hospital oncologico nella giornata di sabato va immediatamente ripristinato – tuona Minardi –. La sua chiusura rappresenta un grave errore e segna l’ennesimo ridimensionamento delle prestazioni del Santa Croce di Fano . Questo taglio di personale ridimensiona l’attività e la capacità assistenziale oncologica del Santa Croce e ciò, purtroppo, si ripercuote non solo su Fano, ma anche sui cittadini delle vallate del Cesano e Metauro\".\nAmareggiata anche Ruggeri, che a proposito della autorizzazione di posti letto residenziali in provincia, osserva: \"Saltamartini penalizza Fano per premiare i fedelissimi, ovvero Pesaro e Senigallia, che hanno assorbito quasi il totale dei nuovi posti letto residenziali autorizzati\". Invece Fano, \"nonostante le continue promesse e un’esigenza evidente e documentata\", non ha avuto nulla. \"Solo a Fano – sottolinea – sono mille le persone che convivono con forme di demenza\". Da anni si discute di un progetto per realizzare una struttura residenziale per malati di Alzheimer a Fano, per il quale la Fondazione ha già un progetto e le risorse necessarie. Ma senza posti letto convenzionati dalla Regione, il progetto non può decollare.\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo\nAlzheimer",
