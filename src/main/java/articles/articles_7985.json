    "title": "Last 2 years crossed 1.5C global warming limit: EU monitor",
    "text": "The last two years exceeded on average a critical warming limit for the first time as global temperatures soar \"beyond what modern humans have ever experienced\", an EU agency said Friday.\nThis does not mean the internationally-agreed 1.5C warming threshold has been permanently breached, but the Copernicus Climate Change Service said it was drawing dangerously near.\nThe EU monitor confirmed that 2024 was the hottest year on record, surpassing 2023 and extending a streak of extraordinary heat that fuelled climate extremes on all continents.\nAnother record-breaking year is not anticipated in 2025, as climate sceptic Donald [Trump](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-news/) takes office, and a deadline looms for nations to commit to deeper cuts to rising levels of greenhouse gases.\nALSO READ: [Trump intel advisor Devin Nunes still dismisses Russian election meddling as a 'hoax'](https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/nunes-trump-intel/)\n[But the ](https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/nunes-trump-intel/)[UK](https://www.rawstory.com/tag/uk) weather service predicts 2025 will still rank among the top three warmest years in the history books.\nThis excess heat supercharges extreme weather, and 2024 saw countries from Spain to Kenya, the United States and Nepal hit by disasters that cost more than $300 billion by some estimates.\nLos Angeles is battling deadly wildfires that have destroyed thousands of buildings and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes. US President [Joe Biden](https://www.rawstory.com/joe-biden/) said the fires were the most \"devastating\" to hit [California](https://www.rawstory.com/tag/california) and were proof that \"climate change is real\".\nCopernicus said sustained, unprecedented warming made average temperatures over 2023 and 2024 more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times.\nNearly 200 nations agreed in Paris in 2015 that meeting 1.5C offered the best chance of preventing the most catastrophic repercussions of climate change.\nBut the world is nowhere on track to meeting that target.\n\"We are now teetering on the edge of passing the 1.5C level,\" said Copernicus climate deputy director Samantha Burgess.\nClimate extremes\nCopernicus records go back to 1940 but other sources of climate data, such as ice cores and tree rings, allow scientists to say the Earth today is likely the warmest its been in tens of thousands of years.\nWorld map showing sea surface temperature anomalies in 2024, according to data from Copernicus\nThe 1.5C threshold is measured in decades, not individual years, but Copernicus said reaching this limit even briefly illustrated the unprecedented changes being brought about by humanity.Scientists say every fraction of a degree above 1.5C is consequential, and that beyond a certain point the climate could shift in ways that are difficult to anticipate.\nAt present levels, human-driven climate change is already making droughts, storms, floods and heatwaves more frequent and intense.\nThe death of 1,300 pilgrims in Saudi Arabia from extreme heat, a barrage of powerful tropical storms in Asia and North America, and historic flooding in Europe and Africa marked grim milestones in 2024.\nThe oceans, a crucial climate regulator which absorb 90 percent of excess heat from greenhouse gases, warmed to record levels in 2024, straining coral reefs and marine life and stirring violent weather.\nWarmer seas mean higher evaporation and greater moisture in the atmosphere, causing heavier rainfall, feeding energy into cyclones and bringing sometimes unbearable humidity.\nWater vapour in the atmosphere hit fresh highs in 2024 and combined with elevated temperatures caused floods, heatwaves and \"misery for millions of people\", Burgess said.\n'Stark warning'\nJohan Rockstrom of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said hitting 1.5C was a \"stark warning sign\".\n\"We have now experienced the first taste of a 1.5C world, which has cost people and the global economy unprecedented suffering and economic costs,\" he told AFP.\nScientists say the onset of a warming El Nino phenomenon in 2023 contributed to the record heat that followed.\nBut El Nino ended in early 2024, and scientists have puzzled over why global temperatures have remained at record or near-record levels ever since.\nIn December, the World Meteorological Organization said if an opposite La Nina event took over in coming months it would be too \"weak and short-lived\" to have much of a cooling effect.\n\"The future is in our hands -- swift and decisive action can still alter the trajectory of our future climate,\" said Copernicus climate director Carlo Buontempo.\nNations agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at a UN summit in 2023 but the latest meeting in November struggled to make any progress around how to make deeper reductions to heat-trapping emissions.",

    "text": "Fanático religioso condenado a cadena perpetua por asesinar a una familia musulmana en Canadá Nathaniel Veltman de 23 años fue declarado culpable de actos terroristas, luego de dar muerte a cuatro personas, incluyendo a una menor de edad, en la localidad de London durante junio de 2021. Toronto de Canadá La justicia de Canadá condenó a un supremacista blanco por actos terroristas ocurridos hace casi tres años. La jueza Renee Pomerance sentenció a cinco cadenas perpetuas a Nathaniel Veltman por el ataque mortal contra una familia musulmana en la ciudad de London en Ontario. El sujeto de 23 años, un ultraderechista conservador y racista, atropelló intencionalmente a un matrimonio, su hija y la abuela. El atacante también dejó herido al hijo menor de la pareja, quien tenía nueve años en ese momento. También puedes leer La magistrada determinó que Veltman ejecutó “una actividad terrorista” al lanzar la camioneta que conducía contra las víctimas. En noviembre de 2023 un tribunal ya lo había encontrado culpable de cuatro asesinatos y un intento de asesinato, pero quedaba pendiente saber si era calificado por terrorismo. Un video mostró que el asesino decidió girar en 180 grados el vehículo en una carretera, para lanzarse contra la familia que iba caminando. El sujeto había escrito un manifiesto antes de cometer los atropellos. Nathaniel Veltman le quitó la vida a Madiha Salman (44 años), Salman Afzaal (46), Yumhan Afzaal (15) y Talat Afzaal (74), además de dejar herido a Fayez Afzaal (9). Antes de asesinar a la familia, el seguidor de ideas de ultraderecha escribió un texto inspirado en el supremacista blanco Brenton Tarrant, quien asesinó a 51 musulmanes en Nueva Zelanda en 2019. Las organizaciones sociales, musulmanas y de defensa de los derechos humanos de Canadá habían exigido que el atacante fuera calificado como un terrorista. En territorio canadiense se han producido una serie de ataques en contra de la comunidad musulmana, pero nunca antes la justicia calificó los hechos de terrorismo. El hecho más grave se vivió en 2017, cuando un seguidor de Trump entró armado a una mezquita de Quebec, asesinando a seis personas y dejando heridas a otras seis. [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/veltman-muslim-family-conviction-killing-1.7121217) da cuenta que los familiares de las víctimas emitieron un comunicado en el que reconocen que “la sentencia de hoy ha traído alivio a personas cercanas y lejanas”.

    "title": "CUNY cops fear schools unprepared for looming onslaught of anti-Israel protests: ‘It’s going to be bad’",
    "text": "Big Apple college campuses are woefully unprepared to respond to the fresh wave of “potentially dangerous” anti-Israel protests expected when students return to the classroom this fall, CUNY cops warned. The CUNY officers, who blame a systematic dismantling of the public university system’s police forces for the lack of preparation, sounded the alarm after violent demonstrations erupted at campuses across the city in response to the Israel-Hamas war. “The university is going into this under fire – they have no idea what’s going to happen. There’s no preparation,” a CUNY officer speaking on condition of anonymity told The Post. 3 City College of New York was the site of violent anti-Israel demonstrations last spring, and CUNY police officers fear campuses city-wide are ill-prepared to deal with the next wave. Getty Images CUNY schools were the scene of some of the ugliest campus violence in the five boroughs last spring — from the occupation of CUNY Graduate Center’s library to a series of violent riots at City College of New York (CCNY)’s Upper Manhattan campus that caused more than $3 million in damage. Even with upcoming events like the anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre and the presidential elections promising “turmoil,” CUNY officers said school safety officials have done no preparation whatsoever. “There have been no meetings about any of this. Ever since the encampment ended, everyone went on vacation. There’s no ‘Let’s prepare for September,&#039;” he said, noting the schools will likely have a cursory meeting to “check the box” but won’t form any actual battle plan. “It’s going to be bad. Our numbers just aren’t there. If there’s a spontaneous protest that we don’t have any knowledge of, we’re going to be outnumbered – just by the sheer number of students enrolled, we’re outnumbered,” another officer shared. Students will head back to CUNY classrooms on August 28. Meanwhile, the officers’ fingers point squarely at CUNY Executive Public Safety Director André Brown, who took office in 2020. 3 Officers placed blame on CUNY Executive Public Safety Director André Brown, who they say has depressed department morale and steadily replaced trained university cops with security contractors who lack adequate riot training. Getty Images Brown, they claim, epitomizes the post-George Floyd “hands off” policing approach that’s taken hold at universities and police departments across the country, emphasizing “de-escalation” above all, even while officers were being pelted with rocks at campus protests earlier this year. At the same time, officers said Brown has steadily replaced trained CUNY cops with contracted private security contractors — who lack any formal law enforcement training, including how to handle crowd control, they claim. “They just want them to observe and report. It’s absolutely zero. All it is is a window dressing of convenience. They don’t have any sort of requirements that we require for our civil service positions. They’re replacing the civil servants with contractors,” the officer said. 3 Officers tell The Post a lack of adequate training and equipment has led to officers being assaulted and physically injured, and expressed fears CUNY has done nothing to ready its forces for upcoming protests in the fall. Getty Images Officers say Brown’s approach to campus safety has gutted CUNY’s police force from within, causing attrition rates to skyrocket and department morale to plummet. “There’s no retention anymore with our police. Our academy class used to be 100-to-150. We’ve got five now – five in the academy class. That’s how bad it got,” an officer said, bemoaning the inefficient use of campus safety funds. “They pay is so low for these guys and they’re paying millions for contractors to be here with no training, no background,” he added. “The safety of the campus community is totally not their concern. They’re not concerned about the students and the staff. They’re worried about their image and making sure the students express their freedom of speech.” CUNY’s Public Safety Department did not respond to The Post’s request for comment from Brown. An email sent to Brown’s official CUNY email bounced back as undeliverable.",

    "text": "La temperatura media en China en julio fue la más alta registrada en dicho mes desde 1961, según el Centro Meteorológico Nacional. Durante el séptimo mes del año, la temperatura media en el país asiático alcanzó los 23,2 grados, 1,1 grados más alta que la temperatura en años considerados normales, informó este jueves el subdirector de la institución, Jia Xialong, citado hoy por el diario China Daily. \"En julio, China se enfrentó a una combinación de lluvias extremas y temperaturas extremadamente altas en todo el país\", señaló Jia en un evento en Pekín. El sur de China sufrió una ola de calor generalizada y prolongada, con múltiples regiones experimentando altas temperaturas continuas durante más de 20 días. Un total de 59 estaciones meteorológicas nacionales registraron temperaturas máximas diarias que rompieron o igualaron récords históricos. Los récords de calor se rompieron en todo el mundo el mes pasado, siendo el 22 de julio el día más caluroso registrado en la Tierra, con una temperatura media diaria global de 17,15°C. El aumento repentino de la temperatura media diaria del 21 al 22 de julio se debió principalmente a temperaturas significativamente más altas de lo normal en el hemisferio norte, particularmente en América del Norte y Europa, así como en la mayor parte de la Antártida, explicó el experto. Según las previsiones del Centro, las temperaturas en la mayor parte de China seguirán siendo más altas de lo habitual en agosto: se esperan dos olas de calor significativas en la primera mitad de agosto, y se prevé que las altas temperaturas disminuyan a finales de mes. En julio, fuertes precipitaciones dejaron más de una treintena de fallecidos y cientos de miles de damnificados en el centro de China. En los últimos veranos, los eventos climáticos extremos han causado estragos en el gigante asiático: los meses estivales de 2023 estuvieron marcados por las citadas inundaciones en Pekín, mientras que, en 2022, diversas olas de calor extremo y sequías azotaron el centro y el este del país. En julio de 2021, precipitaciones de una intensidad inédita en décadas dejaron casi 400 muertos en la provincia central de Henan, que el Ejecutivo chino achacó a una \"falta de preparación y de percepción de riesgo\" por parte de las autoridades locales .

    "text": "En la Ciudad de México pasa de todo y no es de sorprender pues alguna vez el gran pintor Salvador Dalí que México era “más surrealista que sus pinturas” Ya que gracias a Tik Tok nos hemos dado cuenta como se ha estado viendo el cielo por las tardes en esta hermosa urbe llamada Ciudad de México, donde se ha podido ver un arcoiris de fuego. ¿Qué son los Arcoíris de Fuego? Realmente se llaman arco circunhorizontal y aunque suena más chévere arcoiris de fuego, estos ocurren cuando el sol se encuentra en su punto más alto, por lo que es común verlos durante la tarde pues los cristales de hielo hexagonales proyectan un espectro de colores al rebotar. La razón por la que son difíciles de ver es que, para que ocurran en el cielo, las partículas con las que choca la luz deben ser de un tamaño particularmente pequeño, de apenas unos micrómetros, pero a la vez se deben encontrar organizadas en capas de partículas de un tamaño similar. Eso sí, si quieres ver un video del fenómeno en vivo, te dejamos el que fue capturado por el usuario @joelee.mx en Tik Tok, ya que se puede apreciar ciertas zonas de la CDMX pintadas con este increíble fenómeno.",
