    "text": "As speakers at the Democratic National Convention call out Donald Trump for his dangerous Project 2025 agenda that threatens our national security, here are the facts:\nTrump’s Project 2025 agenda would put our national security at risk and leave our allies out to dry.\nCenter for American Progress : “Project 2025 Will Undermine America’s National Security”\n“[Project 2025] includes a vision for the ‘common defense’ that will place the United States in direct confrontation with its adversaries and privilege unilateral militarism over a thoughtful, holistic, and adequately resourced national security strategy. In so doing, Project 2025’s proposals would fundamentally undermine America’s national and economic security, and ordinary Americans will pay the price.\n“Project 2025 would politicize the military chain of command and U.S. intelligence agencies.”\nCBS News : “The Department of Homeland Security, established in 2002, should be dismantled and its agencies either combined with others, or moved under the purview of other departments altogether, the policy book states.”\nWired : “Project 2025, a widely circulated playbook from the influential right-leaning Heritage Foundation, takes aim at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on several fronts, especially its efforts to reduce dangerous online misinformation. If former president Donald Trump wins the election and appoints officials who follow the playbook’s recommendations for CISA, the five-year-old agency could face an unprecedented crisis.\n“The document ‘appears blind to the fact that Russia, China, and Iran are weaponizing social media networks to create a false narrative that weakens US national security,’ [Mark Montgomery, senior director of the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies] says.”\nREMINDER: Project 2025 is Trump and Vance’s 900+ page anti-freedom agenda crafted by the Heritage Foundation and Trump’s far-right extremist allies – it’s “undeniably a Trump-driven operation,” and Vance has praised it as containing “good ideas.”\nAxios : “This is undeniably a Trump-driven operation. The biggest tell: Johnny McEntee — one of Trump’s closest White House aides, and his most fervent internal loyalty enforcer — is a senior adviser to Project 2025. One of the most powerful architects is Stephen Miller, a top West Wing adviser for the Trump administration.”\nCNN : “Trump claims not to know who is behind Project 2025. A CNN review found at least 140 people who worked for him are involved”\nPolitico : “Many of the authors of the blueprint are former Trump officials, and the Heritage Foundation has spent the past year-plus recruiting people to implement the plans within the administration , Scott said.”\nThe Week : “Many of Trump’s indicated plans for a second term fall in line with the Project 2025 outline.”\nNew York Times : “[Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts] told me that he views Heritage’s role today as ‘institutionalizing Trumpism.’ … The lesson of Trump’s first year in office, Roberts told me, is that ‘the Trump administration … simply got a slow start. And Heritage and our allies in Project 2025 believe that must never be repeated.’”\nWashington Post : “Trump took a private flight with Project 2025 leader in 2022”\n“‘They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,’ Trump said.”\nVance : “I’ve reviewed a lot of [Project 2025]. There are some good ideas in there.”\nAxios : “J.D. Vance wrote foreword of upcoming book from Project 2025 architect”\nThe New Republic : “Project 2025 Leader Is Overjoyed by Trump’s Vice Presidential Pick”\nNick Corasaniti, New York Times : “[Roberts] reacted to the news [of Vance’s VP selection] ‘with a broad smile on my face’ and said that ‘privately, we were really rooting for him.’”\nVox : “Kevin Roberts, the president of the right-wing Heritage Foundation and the driving force behind Project 2025, told Ward that ‘ [Vance] is absolutely going to be one of the leaders — if not the leader — of our movement.’”\nPolitico : “Vought told POLITICO Magazine that he is in ‘regular contact’ with Vance’s Hill office and that ‘we probably have one of the closest relationships with [Vance’s] office that we do with any Hill office.’”\nAmericans are learning more and more about the Trump-Vance ticket’s extreme and unpopular Project 2025 agenda – and rejecting this dangerous and out-of-touch MAGA blueprint.\nNavigator Research : “Project 2025 Has Become Significantly More Unfavorable Since Trump Attempted to Distance Himself From the Plan”\n“Project 2025 has seen a significant increase in both awareness and unfavorability since our last survey in June. 54 percent of Americans report being familiar with Project 2025 … Among those familiar with the Project 2025, just 11 percent view it favorably, while 43 percent view it unfavorably.\n“When people are asked what negative news they have heard recently concerning Donald Trump, mentions of Project 2025 have dramatically increased. … A plurality of Americans believe Project 2025 accurately represents what Trump stands for.”\nNavigator Research : “Americans oppose all the key elements in Project 2025, with the greatest concerns around health care, worker’s rights, and dismantling federal programs. Over four in five Americans oppose an array of policies proposed in Project 2025 such as ‘allowing employers to stop paying hourly workers overtime’ … Additionally, four in five oppose ‘allowing the government to monitor people’s pregnancies to potentially prosecute them if they miscarry.’\n“Americans’ overall opposition to Project 2025 increases after reading about its specific policy goals.\n“Three in five Americans say Project 2025 would benefit the wealthiest Americans, CEOs, and corporations.”\nMiami Herald : “As Americans learn more about Project 2025, they become more opposed, poll finds”",

Se utilizaron dos frecuencias: 860 MHz con 0,5 W de potencia, correspondiente a celulares 2G, y 2,5 GHz con 0,1 W de potencia, similar a un módem de Wi-Fi. Los resultados revelaron un incremento en el estrés oxidativo, daños testiculares en los machos y efectos neuropsiquiátricos evidentes en estudios como el electroencefalograma.\nAdemás, se observó apoptosis (muerte celular), severos daños al ADN en la sangre de los adultos y dificultades en el desarrollo físico y motor. Roberto Linares, doctor en Ciencias en Ingeniería Eléctrica y líder de la investigación, destacó que el estudio se llevó a cabo durante cinco años (2015-2020) para obtener datos precisos y subrayó que los daños observados son motivo de gran preocupación.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Científicos identifican el volcán que entró en erupción en 1831 y que causó un enfriamiento global: fue descubierto en una zona disputada por Rusia y Japón]\nRespaldo de la OMS sobre los efectos del Wifi\nLa Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) respalda las afirmaciones del estudio a través de su Centro Internacional de Investigaciones sobre el Cáncer. La OMS ha establecido que la exposición a campos electromagnéticos podría ser un factor desencadenante del cáncer en los seres humanos. Aunque aún no existen pruebas concluyentes sobre sus efectos fatales, hay evidencias de que la piel y otros tejidos en contacto directo con estos dispositivos, así como el cerebro y diversos órganos que absorben las ondas, son los más afectados.\nLa creciente preocupación por los efectos de las ondas electromagnéticas en la salud pública ha llevado a un llamado a la acción. Es fundamental que tanto la comunidad científica como la población en general consideren estos hallazgos y evalúen la posibilidad de reducir la exposición a estos campos electromagnéticos en su vida diaria.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "That UTEP game was fun, but we've had this one circled for a while. Old border rivals Nebraska and Colorado under the lights at Memorial Stadium, on an NBC broadcast? We can do that. GAME PICKS Which of the two quarterbacks, Dylan Raiola or Shedeur Sanders, has a better day? Amie Just, columnist: Sanders has more yards, but Raiola has more overall success. Luke Mullin, reporter: To quote linebacker Mikai Gbayor, “you can’t compare Dylan to Shedeur Sanders.” Give me Sanders, though, as the veteran who's been in this moment before. Nate Head, sports editor: Raiola makes a mistake early — either a turnover or a big miss — but then is cool and collected the rest of the way. Sanders puts up big numbers, including sacks taken. People are also reading… Colton Stone, digital sports editor: Raiola will have a cleaner night, even if Sanders racks up the stats. Who leads Nebraska in rushing? Just: Emmett Johnson. Mullin: Dante Dowdell, shaking off last week's fumble, resumes his role as NU's lead back. Head: Rahmir Johnson. Matt Rhule mentioned him by name Thursday. The four-back rotation can't continue forever. Stone: The running back that doesn't fumble. So let's say Emmett Johnson. How many times will Nebraska sack Shedeur Sanders? Just: Five, with a few tackles for loss outside of the pocket. Mullin: Five, with Ty Robinson accounting for two of those sacks. Head: Let's say seven. Nebraska's front is going to be energized by the crowd, and get after the QB early and often. I'd love to see James \"Sack Man\" Williams get in on one. Stone: Returning Huskers accounted for 3½ of last season's eight sacks; I think they manage six this time around. What big play or decision will everyone be talking about on Sunday? Just: A 73-yard Dylan Raiola to Jahmal Banks touchdown. Mullin: Tommi Hill outplaying Travis Hunter at cornerback. Head: I think we'll see Nebraska score a touchdown on defense or special teams. I lean special teams — Jacory Barney looked awfully slippery in Week 1. Stone: NU chooses to go for it on fourth down, late in the second quarter, to punch in a TD instead of settling for a field goal. OVER/UNDERS Dylan Raiola pass yards — 245.5 Just: Over. Mullin: Over. Head: Under. Stone: Over. Travis Hunter receiving yards: 85.5 Just: Over. Mullin: Over. Head: Over. Stone: Under. Isaiah Neyor receiving yards: 58.5 Just: Over. Mullin: Over. Head: Under. Stone: Over. Shedeur Sanders pass yards: 309.5 Just: Under. Mullin: Under. Head: Over. Stone: Over. Rahmir Johnson rushing yards: 36.5 Just: Under. Mullin: Over. Head: Over. Stone: Over.",
