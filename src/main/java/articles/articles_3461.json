Jenkins and four others – La’Niyah Nevaeh McLeod, 19, of North Port; J’Mari Mitchell, 18, of Lake Placid; Yoshabelle “Yoshi” Edouard, 19, of Port Charlotte; and Latarius Lamar Johnson, 26, of Lake Placid entered not guilty pleas in Daley’s murder. Detectives believe the five defendants – whom Daley knew well – set him up to be robbed at gunpoint in the Ramada motel room.",

The trail becomes extremely slippery. We always advise climbers to stop and seek shelter when conditions turn dangerous,” he said.\nHe also reminded climbers to always carry rain gear and basic safety equipment, as well as to never attempt the climb alone or without a guide.\nAs of this afternoon, no untoward incidents have been reported.\nSabah Parks is continuing to monitor weather conditions to ensure the safety of climbers still on the mountain.\nStanding at 4,095 metres, Mount Kinabalu is a popular climbing destination for both domestic and international adventurers.\nHowever, weather conditions remain a critical factor in ensuring the safety and success of any climb.",

    "text": "Uganda Martyrs' Day celebrations must prioritise faith, Archbishop insists What you need to know: While giving an update on the level of preparations, Wokorach, who has been serving as the Bishop of the Nebbi Catholic Diocese, told journalists on Friday, May 31, during a media briefing held at Uganda Catholic Secretariat, in Nsambya, in Kampala, that Namugongo risks becoming anything else apart from a spiritual center The archbishop designate of Gulu Catholic Archdiocese Raphael P’Mony Wokorach has said the Uganda Martyrs' Day celebrations should only be accompanied by faith and spiritual activities and nothing else. While giving an update on the level of preparations, Wokorach, who has been serving as the Bishop of the Nebbi Catholic Diocese, told journalists on Friday, May 31, during a media briefing held at Uganda Catholic Secretariat, in Nsambya, in Kampala, that Namugongo risks becoming anything else apart from a spiritual center. \"We risk Namugongo becoming anything other than a spiritual center. As we prepare, you feel pressure from all sides... The politicians come to help us (but under conditions) and say, \"I must appear there,\" but that's part of the pressure. Each year, the celebration is held in Namugongo, a township in Wakiso district, with prayers at both the Catholic Shrine of Uganda Martyrs and the Anglican Martyrs' Site. “Let us not draw our attention away from what we are meant to be. Pilgrimage is not a journey for fun but rather a spiritual and religious one that one hopes to benefit from. Let the pressure of the world not overwhelm and evade what Namugongo initially was,\" Wokorach elaborated. Overall, Namugongo celebrations should be protected from all invasions of ideas, the archbishop-elect said. “Namugongo celebrations should be protected from all invasions of ideas and how to look at them... We come together as a nation to celebrate the spiritual life of these Uganda Martyrs, and that is what I say we should protect. That should not be lost on our side. If we don’t look at the Uganda Martyrs as holy people who lived because of God, then we have lost it all,” he said. Nebbi Catholic Diocese is animating this year’s Martyrs Day celebrations under the theme, “But as for me and my household, we shall serve the Lord.” The team is working with a budget of Shs 1.8 billion. Head of the Finance Committee for the Nebbi Catholic Diocese Namugongo preparations Mr Maurice Opar Manano revealed during the press briefing that the government of Uganda had been the biggest financial contributor to the event after giving them Shs 1.1 Billion. Other entities including organisations and individuals have additionally made contributions in one way or another. “The collections in total so far are Shs 1.7 billion against Shs1.8 billion, meaning our deficit is Shs 100 million which is negligible,” Mr Manano said. “The ideas of the committee for the event and the proposed budget were all initiated last year in June 2023 but since then, prices for items have increased and everything else has changed. We have struggled to see if everything fits within the budget,” Mr. Manano added. On the challenges, the organising team said the huge numbers of pilgrims sometimes tend to complicate matters. \"We are simply moving from being a national celebration to an international celebration. Each year, more people come from outside the country. With the growth in numbers, preparations also become very complex from the budget and everything else including issues of security, food, and so forth,” Wokorach said. Amidst everything else, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Uganda Tourism Board (UTB) Lilly Ajarova said the Martyrs Day celebrations come with the blessings of positioning Uganda as a faith-based destination, which is a plus for the country in so many dimensions including enhancing the country’s tourism capabilities. Above everything else, the team says they are all set for the coming celebrations.",

Previous research had ruled out a link, but fresh information about the geology of the area has established a probable connection.\nThe earthquakes were all fairly minor, measuring between 1.34 and 3.18 on the Richter scale, and took place near Newdigate in Surrey in 2018 and 2019. Residents reported their houses shaking for several seconds.\nAdvertisement\nThere was speculation at the time that the earthquakes were linked to oil extraction by UK Oil & Gas, although the epicentre of the earthquakes was between 5 kilometres and 10 kilometres from the company's Horse Hill drilling site. But previous research by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and others determined that the earthquakes, while rare and relatively near to the drilling, were natural and coincidental.\nNow, Matthew Fox and Philip Meredith at University College London have taken another look, using the latest understanding of the rock makeup of the area, and suggest that the earthquakes were indeed induced by oil extraction.\nThe pair ran more than a million computer simulations based on the…\nMatthew Sparkes",

    "text": "CITTÀ DEL VATICANO – In giro ci sono «corvi» che speculano sui malanni del Papa , ma Francesco parla, scherza, ha voglia di reagire. «C’è bisogno di lui» e non bisognerà attendere tanto per rivederlo in Vaticano. Ne è convinto monsignor Vincenzo Paglia, presidente della Pontificia accademia per la vita.\n?«Io ho notizie positive. Mi auguro che il Papa possa guarire presto perché c’è bisogno di lui. C’è bisogno che possa riprendere pienamente la sua vita di pastore della Chiesa, che in questo tempo è più che preziosa: vediamo il mondo che forse ha qualche resipiscenza sulla tragedia della guerra, ma può essere aiutato a comprendere la giustizia, la dignità, i diritti e i doveri della famiglia umana. Questo Papa è necessario».\nFrancesco si è esposto a impegni giubilari e bagni di folla.\n«Sì ma questo è papa Francesco. Certo uno dei problemi della sua salute è la non curanza che a volte manifesta verso la stessa. E forse ci dovrebbe essere maggiore solerzia da parte di tutti noi a proteggerlo. Io comunque la prima lezione che traggo da questa sua esagerazione è quella di interrogarci sulle nostre esagerazioni contrarie: troppa cura di se stessi e poca cura delle relazioni con gli altri».\nIl Papa in effetti la sera chiama la parrocchia di Gaza.\n«In un mondo che vive del virtuale questo sta a dire quanto tenga alle relazioni dirette e immediate, fino all’esagerazione».\nGiorgia Meloni ha riferito di averlo trovato vigile e sempre dotato di senso dell’umorismo.\n«Mi fa molto piacere, anche perché non mancano i corvi, e sapere che il Papa continua anche a scherzare mi pare una notizia utile per tutti».\nQuando parla di corvi si riferisce alle fake news che girano sull’aggravarsi del Papa?\n«Sì, e non solo. Guardiamo con maggiore positività a questo momento».\nMa se guarirà ce la farà il Papa con tutti impegni del giubileo a continuare a governare?\n«Quando ha cominciato a stare sulla sedia a rotelle qualcuno ha chiesto al Papa se poteva ancora governare, e Francesco ha ricordato l’episodio del cardinale Marchetti Selvaggiani, al quale un monsignore mandato da Pio XI domandò la stessa cosa, e il cardinale rispose: dica a chi lo ha mandato che Roma si governa con la testa e non con i piedi. La Chiesa non è anzitutto un’organizzazione, la Chiesa si governa facendo risplendere il primato dell’amore per gli altri».\nSecondo lei quando tornerà il Papa in Vaticano?\n«Non sono un medico ma immagino che non bisognerà aspettare molto. E mi auguro che sia molto più attento lui e tutti noi a moderare, diciamo così, i suoi eccessi di impegno. Tutti sappiamo quanto il contatto diretto con la gente sia per lui davvero vita. Del resto era quello che capitava a Gesù, quando scese dal monte tutti volevano toccarlo perché da lui usciva una forza straordinaria che aiutava e guariva».\nMa a 88 anni e con i germi che girano il contatto è pericoloso.\n«Esatto: mi auguro che gli altri lo aiutino… Allo stesso tempo sono sicuro che accadrà quello che avvenne quando gli apostoli cercarono di frenare Gesù con i bambini: lasciate che vengano a me».\nIntanto la Chiesa prega: il cardinale vicario Reina ha invitato i fedeli della diocesi di Roma a pregare per la salute del Papa.\n«Bene ha fatto a esortare la Chiesa di Roma a pregare per il suo pastore. Questo è accaduto fin dall’inizo, come narrano gli Atti degli apostoli quando San Pietro era in carcere. Non che il Gemelli sia un carcere! Però è doveroso che i fedeli preghino per lui. E da malato il Papa invita a riscoprire la forza della preghiera, non solo per sé, anche per tutti coloro che soffrono, pensiamo alle guerre, ai malati, agli anziani soli».\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",
