    "text": "USU Blanding Instructor Using Power of Stories to Connect Students and Course Material By [Marcus Jensen](mailto:marcus.jensen@usu.edu) | BLANDING, Utah — A Utah State University Blanding professor is using the power of stories to help connect her students to the material they are learning. Josi Russell, an associate professor of English in the [College of Humanities and Social Sciences](https://chass.usu.edu/index.php), uses what she calls “story-based course design,” which allows her students the chance to personally engage with course content, rather than just listen to it. “Story-based course design frames course material as a narrative in which the student participates in the course as a character,” Russell said. “In a story-based course, students step inside the material to take charge of the course instead of just taking it. They take on the role of explorers rather than observers.” Throughout her teaching career, which began in 2001, Russell has had to adapt her method of teaching. Many of her courses are taught completely online, which adds to the challenge of engaging students. Russell believes that online education can be just as fulfilling and engaging as face-to-face learning, if it is developed deliberately and infused with creativity. She developed her teaching style to better adapt to online learners. “I learned how quickly a learner can disengage when staring at a monitor. So I began to adapt,” Russell said. “Back in 2013, I began experimenting with ways to expand the borders of my classroom and found the new generation of learners was highly responsive to more engaging courses with more online content.” Russell is a published author, having published more than 20 novels, as well as short stories. With this unique lens, Russell feels strongly that story-based teaching has strong potential for students in leveraging the power of stories to engage learners. By allowing students to immerse themselves in a course and become a part of the content, she has seen strong engagement from her online students. “I felt that students would engage more fully if they could see themselves as part of a story — epic heroes or travelers on a quest — so I redesigned my classes to be immersive experiences that would help students step inside the content,” she said. I didn’t want them to simply take my course, I wanted them to take ownership of it.” In her English 2220 course “Introduction to Fiction”, Russell has designed the class as a “Choose Your Own Adventure Story,” complete with wrong turns, foes to be vanquished and quests to be undertaken. As they navigate the story, students read seven novels and learning about different genres and features of fiction. Students face challenges where they can earn gold coins to be used on hard questions or special objects to help then through their quest. All their assignments are framed as conversations between themselves and various characters in the story. The students are cast as the heroes of the story. “When the student is the hero of the story, the power dynamic of the classroom changes,” Russell said. “The professor becomes a guide and observer as students strike out on their own quest for knowledge, driven not by the threat of failure, but by the magical lure of discovery and adventure.” In her English 1010 course, students engage in a “race around the world” journey, stepping into different cultures and communities. And in English 2010, Russell casts students as designers, architects and problem-solvers who create a library and fill it with resources for a particular community. After redesigning her courses, Russell has seen a spike in positive feedback and student engagement. Russell found that the COVID pandemic further led to students fatiguing with content that was impersonal, flat or unengaging. She believes that her method can help students continue to engage while taking charge of their own learning. She recently shared this teaching method as part of her presentation at the 2023 [Empowering Teaching Excellence Conference.](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/ete_conf/2023/all/32/) In this presentation, Russell shared her own journey of recrafting her courses, then shared a six-step process for other educators to craft story-based courses, regardless of the subject matter they teach. “This is a new way of teaching and a new way of learning,” Russell said. “I find things to improve every semester. My willingness to take risks and try something new seems to also free my students to innovate and experiment. I am proud of the fact that my classes ask students to step boldly into the adventure of their own education.” Word of mouth has been strong for Russell’s courses, as she routinely has a wait-list for students who want to take her courses, with many classes having a waitlist of more than 50 students.

    "title": "British priests riot against Vatican due to gay marriage blessings | MENAFN.COM",
    "text": "( MENAFN ) In response to the recent landmark ruling by Pope Francis allowing priests to issue blessings to same-sex couples under specific conditions, a group of British priests has released an open letter reaffirming the \"unchangeable\" teachings of the Catholic Church. The Vatican's doctrinal office issued a document on Monday, stating that Roman Catholic priests could choose to provide blessings to same-sex couples on a \"case-by-case basis,\" emphasizing that this process does not supersede the sacrament of heterosexual marriage and cannot occur during regular church rituals or liturgy.\nThe letter, signed by around 500 priests from the UK's Confraternity of Catholic Clergy and released on Thursday, seeks to address what it describes as \"widespread confusion\" following the Vatican's decree. The priests express their commitment to upholding the traditional values of the Church, emphasizing that these values remain \"unchanged and unchangeable.\"\nWhile acknowledging the Vatican's perspective that such blessings reflect God's welcoming of all individuals, the British priests argue that providing blessings to same-sex couples would be perceived as a form of approval. The letter contends that there is no situation in which such blessings could be adequately distinguished from some level of approval, deeming them \"pastorally and practically inadmissible.\"\nThe article explores the concerns raised by the British priests, delving into the evolving dynamics within the Catholic Church regarding LGBTQ+ issues. It examines the impact of the Vatican's decision on the global Catholic community and the ongoing dialogue between traditional teachings and the calls for more inclusive practices within the Church.\nMENAFN24122023000045015687ID1107652562\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "In recent weeks, Twitch has been filled with debates about content moderation and advertising policies. And at the center of it all are Asmongold and HasanAbi. Dubbed the “ adpocalypse ,” this wave of demonetization has left many creators and viewers questioning the platform’s future.\nHasan blames Asmon and the people he collaborates with. | Image Credit: @HasanAbi/YouTube Hasan has blamed fellow content creator Asmon for the so-called Twitch adpocalypse, which is now oddly simlar to YouTube’s advertiser fallout in 2016-2017. Known for his outspoken criticism of the platform’s policies, Asmon responded candidly, accepting partial responsibility for the issue. Is this the first step of a domino effect that leads to the platform downfall?\nAsmongold Doesn’t Disagree With Hasan, But It’s Much Deeper Than That Asmon agrees that some of it is on him. | Image Credit: @asmongold/YouTube The drama began with FaZe Kaysan, who revealed that his Twitch channel had been demonetized for using the ‘Iran’ tag in his streams. Other creators, such as BigEx, also faced similar situations for using tags like ‘Venezuela’.\nim about to go live right now, i just found out i was demonetized on twitch for representing my country venezuela, for the past month i didnt make a single penny on ads… i have had venezuela in my tags for the longest… this is absurd im missing thousands of dollars.\n— Ex 🌟 (@ExSZN) November 13, 2024 Hasan linked these incidents to Asmongold, attributing it to his criticisms of the platform’s moderation practices. Hasan says that Asmon threatening to reveal the moderation team’s biases has played a role in alienating advertisers.\n🚨Asmongold responds to Hasanabi Blaming Him For Twitch Adpocalypse also calls out Frogan,Denims, and others for taking No Accountabilty👀\n\"The issue is that people are not taking accountability for the bad things that they're doing, and they're trying to pretend like they're… pic.twitter.com/T4ZWvnQYqw\n— Bestfriend (@BestfriendKick) November 13, 2024 Asmon did not shy away from the accusations. Addressing Hasan’s comments, he noted that he might have contributed to the so-called adpocalypse. “ I don’t think it’s entirely my fault, but some of it definitely is ,” he told his viewers.\nRelated “Throwing people under the bus doesn’t help your situation”: Dr Disrespect Exposing Twitch Streamers, Who Should’ve Been Banned, Leaves a Bitter Taste in Fans’ Mouths Talking about past controversies, including his own suspension for remarks about Palestinian culture, he emphasized the need for accountability.

Kaysan is originally from Iran 👀 pic.twitter.com/rcyB8CrBau\n— FearBuck (@FearedBuck) November 13, 2024 The financial impact of these controversies is already apparent. FaZe Kaysan and others have reported significant losses due to demonetization. Kaysan revealed that his use of the ‘Iran’ tag resulted in his inability to generate ad revenue, despite years of using the tag without issue.\nWill This Be A YouTube 2.0 Situation? Where Does It Go From Here? Image Credit: Twitch The situation has been escalated after Asmon’s reaction to the recent controversy with Central_Committee, a political streamer. When the streamer was only issued a three-day ban, Asmon demanded stricter action, threatening to expose the platform ‘s alleged biases.\nAsmongold plans to do a stream exposing Twitch and its biased moderation team and says that if he gets banned for the expose, he’ll move to Rumble or Kick 👀 pic.twitter.com/glMsSghAzk\n— FearBuck (@FearedBuck) November 13, 2024 The looming threat of an adpocalypse is concerning for the platform’s creators, especially those reliant on ad revenue. If the platform goes through a change like YouTube, creators producing edgy or politically charged material may face stricter restrictions or reduced income.\nRelated Johnny Somali’s Latest Crime Might Land Him in Korean Prison for 7 Years as Ex-Twitch Streamer F*cks Around and Finds Out The higher ups of the platform now stand at a crossroads. With calls for greater accountability and fairer moderation, the platform must balance the demands of its creators, viewers, and advertisers.\nAsmon’s threat to expose further issues and with his willingness to move to rival platforms like Kick or Rumble shows just how bad the situation could become.\nWhile Asmon and Hasan are on opposing ends of the situation, the call for action isn’t for either of them but for the platform itself. Now all we can do is wait for this situation to unfold.",

    "text": "[Conflicts & War](https://www.laprensalatina.com/category/conflicts-war/) Israel continues offensive in Gaza, but medium-term plan unclear Jerusalem, Dec 28 (EFE). – The Israeli army continued its offensive in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, where heavy fighting with Hamas continues, but despite Israel’s declaration that it is committed to the long term, the medium-term scenario of its offensive remains unclear. As Hamas disseminates videos showing its militias ambushing and attacking Israeli troops and tanks, the Israeli army continues to carry out operations in the north, center and south of the Strip. In the southern city of Khan Younis, Israeli forces carried out an “unprecedented mission,” according to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “Our forces reach areas that we have never been before, taking over control rooms and eliminating terrorists,” said Gallant on Thursday. In turn, the troops intensified their military incursion in the southern area of the Strip, an operation they began weeks ago to reach the militia’s command centers and weapons depots. Gallant reiterated Israel’s intention to dismantle Hamas in order to hamper its military and governmental capabilities. At least 167 Israeli soldiers have died since the ground invasion of Gaza began on October 27, bringing the total number of soldiers – active and reserve – killed since the Hamas attack on October 7 to more than 500. Meanwhile, Israeli attacks and bombings have continued to claim Palestinian lives in recent hours. According to the Wafa news agency, dozens of Gazans died Thursday in bombings of homes in southern Gaza, an area where a large portion of the enclave’s 1.9 million internally displaced people are concentrated. In the town of Rafah, the southernmost point of the enclave, “at least 20 citizens were killed and dozens injured as a result of an Israeli bombing that targeted a house,” it reported. Israeli warplanes also “targeted a house in the Shaboura refugee camp” in Rafah, also causing “dozens of deaths and injuries, most of them women and children,” said the news agency On the other hand, more than 25 people died in several attacks on Khan Yunis, reported the same source. Over 21,300 people have died in the two and a half months of the offensive, which has caused an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The Israeli assault on Gaza has caused severe shortages of food, basic supplies, medicine, drinking water, and gasoline for electricity. Among other incidents, attacks were reported in the northern towns of Beit Hanun or Beit Lahia, including dozens of deaths, while Israeli troops continue to attack the Al Maghazi refugee camp in the city of Deir, which has been under almost constant bombardment in recent days. The medical services of the Palestinian Red Crescent reported that its teams transferred three dead and six wounded to the hospital after attacks on a house in the Al Maghazi camp. Their medical teams are also now working with the Egyptian Red Crescent to set up a camp for displaced people in the Khan Younis area, which is expected to reach 1,000 tents. All of this is happening while Israel is planning its medium-term actions in Gaza and a post-war plan that seems to be undecided at the moment, causing concern to its main ally, the United States. On Thursday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Gallant and discussed aspects of the stabilization phase that must follow combat operations, according to the Pentagon. The White House is reportedly pressuring Israel to reduce the intensity of attacks on Gaza, although Gallant recently said they could continue for several months.",

    "text": "La Delegación de Limpieza Viaria y RSU del Ayuntamiento de Barbate muestra su satisfacción por la obtención de la Bandera Verde de Sostenibilidad de Ecovidrio, un reconocimiento que premia el esfuerzo colectivo por el reciclaje de envases de vidrio y el compromiso con el desarrollo sostenible. Barbate ha rivalizado con 46 municipios andaluces, consiguiendo un total de 2.325 puntos que le han colocado en tercer lugar en el ranking de municipios españoles. Junto a Algeciras, que también ha sido premiado con este importante galardón, ha logrado una de las dos banderas que se otorgan en Andalucía, convirtiendo a la provincia de Cádiz en referente en reciclaje de vidrio. Esta puntuación se ha logrado gracias al desarrollo de una campaña de comunicación, difusión y concienciación, que ha incluido diversas acciones encaminadas a informar e implicar a la ciudadanía. Este reconocimiento llega tras meses de intenso trabajo en la campaña estival ‘Banderas Verdes’ de Ecovidrio, en la que la Delegación de Limpieza Viaria y RSU del Ayuntamiento de Barbate, que gestiona el edil Francisco Muñoz Jarillo, ha jugado un papel fundamental. Gracias a su implicación, junto con el compromiso de los hosteleros, Barbate ha logrado superar el reto y alzarse con esta distinción que subraya su compromiso con el reciclaje de envases de vidrio. La campaña ‘Movimiento Banderas Verdes’ de Ecovidrio ha contado este 2024 con la colaboración de 116 bares, restaurantes y chiringuitos del término municipal de Barbate, que han sido pieza clave para alcanzar este reconocimiento. De hecho, se ha logrado el reciclaje de un total de 144.500 kilos de vidrio durante los meses de junio, julio y agosto. “El compromiso de la ciudadanía en general ha sido esencial en la difusión de buenas prácticas y en el impulso del reciclaje en el municipio, lo que ha permitido sumar los puntos necesarios para conseguir este prestigioso galardón”, ha señalado el delegado de Limpieza Viaria y RSU del Ayuntamiento de Barbate, Francisco Muñoz Jarillo, quien ha destacado la gestión realizada para “el refuerzo de la contenerización, la colocación de los puntos de depósito y el trabajo de concienciación y contacto con los hosteleros”. El edil ha expresado su satisfacción por la consecución de este galardón, señalando que “esta Bandera Verde es una apuesta personal y una muestra clara de la implicación de Barbate con el reciclaje”. “Nuestro municipio ha demostrado, una vez más, que está a la altura de los grandes retos medioambientales; este premio nos motiva a seguir trabajando para cuidar nuestro entorno y asegurar un futuro más sostenible para todos”. Finalmente, Francisco Muñoz Jarillo ha felicitado al Ayuntamiento de Algeciras, a su alcalde, José Ignacio Landaluce, y a su concejal Javier Vázquez Hueso, por conseguir también la Bandera Verde de la Sostenibilidad de Ecovidrio. La entrega oficial de la Bandera Verde de Sostenibilidad tendrá lugar el próximo 30 de octubre en Madrid, en un acto organizado por Ecovidrio que reunirá a los municipios ganadores a nivel nacional y que estará presidido por la Directora General de Políticas Turísticas de la Secretaría de Estado de Turismo, Ana Muñoz Llabrés.",
