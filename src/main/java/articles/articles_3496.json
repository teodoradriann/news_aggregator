    "text": "Imagine a world where electricity is available anytime, anywhere, without worrying about power outages or fluctuating energy supply. This is exactly what Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) aim to achieve. With the growing demand for clean and renewable energy, BESS has emerged as a game-changer, allowing us to store excess energy and use it when needed.\nBut how does BESS work? Why is it becoming so important in today’s world? And how can industries, businesses, and even homes benefit from it? Let’s break it all down in simple, non-technical language so you can truly understand why BESS is the future of energy storage.\nWhat is a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)?\nA Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is exactly what it sounds like—a system that stores electricity in batteries so it can be used later. It’s like having a power bank for your home, business, or even an entire city.\nThink about solar panels: they generate electricity during the day, but what happens at night or on cloudy days? Without storage, that energy would go to waste. That’s where BESS comes in—it captures the extra energy when it's available and releases it when needed, ensuring a constant power supply.\nMain Components of a BESS\nA BESS isn’t just a single battery—it’s an entire system made up of several key parts:\nBattery Modules: These are the actual storage units, holding the electrical energy. Battery Management System (BMS): This keeps the batteries safe, ensuring they don’t overcharge or overheat. Inverter/Converter: It changes the stored DC power (Direct Current) into AC power (Alternating Current) so that it can be used in homes and businesses. Energy Management System (EMS): This controls the flow of electricity, deciding when to store and when to release energy. How Does BESS Work?\nThe way a Battery Energy Storage System works is actually pretty simple:\nEnergy Generation: Electricity is generated from sources like solar panels, wind turbines, or the main power grid. Energy Storage: Instead of letting unused electricity go to waste, the extra energy is stored in the battery. Energy Release: When demand for power increases or renewable energy isn't available (like nighttime for solar panels), the stored electricity is released back into the system. This means that even when power from the grid is unstable or expensive, businesses and homeowners can still access reliable and affordable electricity.\nTypes of Batteries Used in BESS\nNot all battery storage systems are the same. The type of battery technology used in a BESS affects its performance, cost, and lifespan. Here are the most common ones:\n1. Lithium-Ion Batteries\nThe most widely used type for modern energy storage. High energy efficiency, longer lifespan, and fast charging. Commonly found in electric vehicles (EVs), home energy storage, and large-scale power grids. 2. Lead-Acid Batteries\nOne of the oldest and cheapest battery types. Often used in backup power systems but has a shorter lifespan compared to lithium-ion. Heavier and requires more maintenance. 3. Flow Batteries\nUses liquid electrolytes to store energy. Great for long-duration energy storage but is more expensive. Best suited for large-scale industrial applications. 4. Sodium-Sulfur (NaS) Batteries\nHigh energy density and long life, but requires high temperatures to operate. Mostly used in grid-scale storage. Each battery type has its strengths and weaknesses, but lithium-ion is currently the most popular due to its high efficiency, lightweight design, and longer lifespan.\nWhy is BESS Important?\nNow that we understand what BESS is and how it works, let’s talk about why it’s so important.\n1. Supports Renewable Energy\nSolar and wind power are great, but they don’t produce energy 24/7. With BESS, excess energy generated during the day can be stored and used when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.\n2. Reduces Electricity Costs\nElectricity prices fluctuate throughout the day. BESS allows users to store energy when it’s cheap and use it when prices are high, reducing electricity bills.\n3. Provides Backup Power\nImagine a hospital, data center, or factory losing power—this could lead to serious consequences. BESS provides instant backup power, ensuring businesses and critical facilities keep running during outages.\n4. Stabilizes the Power Grid\nPower demand isn’t constant—it spikes during peak hours and drops during off-peak times. BESS helps by balancing supply and demand, preventing blackouts and overloads.\n5. Reduces Carbon Footprint\nBy relying more on stored renewable energy and less on fossil fuels, BESS helps cut down greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key solution for fighting climate change.\nFuture of BESS\nThe future of Battery Energy Storage Systems looks incredibly promising. As governments push for clean energy policies, demand for BESS is growing worldwide.\nAdvanced Battery Technologies: Scientists are developing solid-state batteries and other alternatives that are safer, more efficient, and longer-lasting. Smart Energy Management: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated into BESS to predict energy demand and optimize usage automatically. Expansion in Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure: BESS will play a major role in EV charging stations, making electric cars more convenient. In the next decade, we can expect larger, cheaper, and more efficient BESS solutions to power homes, businesses, and entire cities.\nBESS for Homes: Making Energy Storage Residential\nBattery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) aren’t just for large industries or power grids—they’re becoming a game-changer for homeowners too. With rising electricity costs and frequent power outages, many households are now installing home battery systems to store solar energy and reduce reliance on the grid. A residential BESS allows homeowners to power their homes at night, use stored electricity during peak hours to save on bills, and even keep essential appliances running during blackouts. Paired with solar panels, a home battery system can turn a house into a self-sufficient mini power station, reducing carbon footprint and increasing energy independence. As battery costs continue to drop, more homes will adopt BESS, making renewable energy storage a practical and affordable solution for everyday use.\nFinal Thoughts\nBattery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are transforming the way we generate, store, and use electricity. Whether it’s powering homes, businesses, or stabilizing the grid, BESS plays a crucial role in ensuring a cleaner, more reliable, and cost-effective energy future.\nWhile there are still challenges like cost and battery lifespan, continuous technological advancements are making BESS more efficient and accessible than ever before.\nAs the world moves towards sustainable energy solutions, BESS is not just an option—it’s a necessity. If you’re considering investing in energy storage, now is the perfect time to explore the possibilities.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Potise\nContact Person: Mike Hassy\nEmail: Send Email\nCity: New York\nState: NY\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.potise.com\nStock Quote API & Stock News API supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nand .",

    "title": "Get ready for soaring food prices as the ‘war on farming’ gains steam to stop ‘climate change’",
    "text": "[Get ready for soaring food prices as the ‘war on farming’ gains steam]\nIf the World Economic Forum (WEF) and its allies in government, media, and the environmental movement have their way, we will soon face serious food shortages and soaring prices in our grocery stores. The excuse? Their impossible goal is to try to stop the climate from changing.\nIn an effort to reduce nitrous oxide (N20), methane (CH4), and of course, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, all of which the WEF mistakenly blames for dangerous global warming, we are supposed to cut back on our use of nitrogen-based fertilizers, cull millions of burping and farting livestock and switch from fossil fuel-powered tractors and other modern farm equipment to subsistence and organic farming. If this ever comes about, it will be an unmitigated disaster. We built the modern world through the use of these wonderful technologies, so suddenly eliminating them would pull the rug out from under today’s 8 billion people, leading to mass starvation, war, and disease.\nIn this three-part series, I will explain that while plans to dramatically reduce N2O, CH4, and CO2 emissions are hopelessly misguided since none of these gases are causing climate problems, efforts to restrict these emissions will radically degrade our ability to feed the world’s growing population if they are not stopped.\nThis week, let’s examine the drive to reduce nitrous oxide N2O from fertilizers.\nMany people consider aircraft, nuclear energy, space flight, television, and computers the most important inventions of the 20th century. But they would be wrong. The removal of any of these important developments, while inconvenient indeed, would not lead to widespread death across the planet. There is, however, one invention that, if eliminated, would cause the starvation of billions of people. That invention is synthetic fertilizers created by what is known as the Haber-Bosch process, which is the synthesis of ammonia from its elements. Ammonia is a key component in various nitrogen-based fertilizers.\nSo, why is this important?\nAll human beings must eat ten essential amino acids to synthesize the body proteins needed for tissue maintenance and growth. Indeed, amino acids are often called the building blocks of proteins. Almost 90% of the amino acids in our diet come from agricultural crops and animals fed on crops (the rest comes from aquatic species and animals grazing on grassland). Now, the yield of intensive agriculture is practically always limited by the availability of nitrogen.\nNitrogen plays vital roles in plant growth, such as:\n- It is part of the chlorophyll molecule, which gives plants their green color. And, of course, chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, the way in which plants convert sunlight, water, and CO2 into energy (sugars). Vigorous growth is only possible with sufficient nitrogen to allow high photosynthesis rates.\n- Nitrogen stimulates cell division and cell elongation, extending the growth period.\n- Nitrogen is a key component of proteins, which are needed for various plant functions. Without adequate nitrogen, plants cannot form proteins, complete photosynthesis, or use carbohydrates effectively, and so they wither and die.\nWithout nitrogen, there would be no life as we know it on Earth.\nCrops get their nitrogen naturally when bacteria and single-celled organisms in the soil convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into biologically usable forms, such as ammonia (NH₃), which are taken up by plants when they absorb water. Counting plant and animal residues, relatively stable soil organic matter and in living soil organisms, mainly microbes such as bacteria, we find that these sources only add up to about half the global need for nitrogen: the other half must come from inorganic nitrogen fertilizers.\nAnd this is where the discovery of German chemist Fritz Haber became so important. In fact, Haber received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of a method to synthesize ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. Carl Bosch, Haber’s collaborator, scaled up the process for industrial use, and so today, the process is known as the Haber-Bosch process. A third of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber–Bosch process, and this supports almost half the world’s population. The Haber-Bosch process significantly boosted crop yields worldwide, revolutionizing agriculture by enabling large-scale nitrogen “fixation” with inorganic fertilizers.\nBut now the World Economic Forum wants to dramatically reduce the use of inorganic fertilizers because, so they say, the nitrous oxide produced when microbes in the soil break down the nitrogen fertilizers that are not absorbed by the plants (i.e., that which is leached into soils, washed into nearby water or released as vapor into the atmosphere) is a threat to the climate. They are also concerned because producing fertilizers is an energy-intensive process and is responsible for almost 1.5% of total global CO2 emissions.\nThe WEF cites a\n2020 study that found that the global use of nitrogen fertilizers for food production could threaten efforts to keep global warming below the much-feared 2 degrees Celsius rise.\nThe WEF tells us that, at present,\n[one-third of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions come from food production], and so it is “urgent” that we launch a [“radical” and “comprehensive” transformation]of the global food system.\nSo the Biden administration\nannounced on July 23rd that it would seek to curb U.S. emissions of nitrous oxide, kicking off the effort with an event that day amid announcements by industrial companies that are taking voluntary actions to cut emissions of the gas. Canada has gone completely off the deep end, setting a national target to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions associated with fertilizers by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. Specifically addressed are nitrous oxide emissions, especially those linked to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use.\nNow, the WEF apparently thinks this can be done without threatening the food supply. In “\nFertiliser emissions could be cut to ‘one-fifth of current levels’ by 2050,” they assert:\n“Fertiliser emissions could be reduced to approximately one-fifth of current levels by 2050 without the need for developing new technologies, a new study finds.\n“The research, published in\nNature Food, looks at the production, trade and use of nitrogen fertilizers around the world to quantify their total greenhouse gas emissions.\n“The study finds that, on its own, making nitrogen use in crops more efficient could halve the demand for synthetic fertilizers, which would reduce their overall emissions.\n“Some of the other proposed actions include using renewable and nuclear energy to power production of fertilizers.\n“By combining all available interventions, the researchers outline that emissions from nitrogen fertilizers could be cut by up to 84% by 2050, a higher figure than previously estimated.\n“However, a co-author on the research tells Carbon Brief that this figure would be “very challenging” to achieve, “both economically and in terms of practical implementation”.\nNow, that is an understatement. Next week, I will examine what the impact of these actions would be on our food supply and the financial bottom line for those involved in agriculture. It isn’t pretty!",

    "text": "The Most Common Foodborne Illness From Fish: Scombroid Poisoning The most common foodborne illness associated with fish is scombroid poisoning , also known as histamine poisoning . This illness occurs after eating fish that hasn’t been properly stored, leading to high levels of histamine production. While symptoms are typically unpleasant, they are rarely life-threatening, making understanding and preventing this type of poisoning essential for seafood lovers.\nUnderstanding Scombroid Poisoning What Causes Scombroid Poisoning? Scombroid poisoning arises when certain types of fish are not properly refrigerated after being caught. These fish naturally contain high levels of histidine, an amino acid. When the fish is exposed to warmer temperatures (above 40°F or 4.4°C), bacteria multiply rapidly and convert the histidine into histamine and other amines. These substances are heat-stable, meaning they are not destroyed by cooking. Consequently, even well-cooked fish can cause illness if histamine levels are high enough.\nWhich Fish Are Most Commonly Involved? The fish most frequently implicated in scombroid poisoning belong to the Scombridae family, which includes:\nTuna Mackerel Bonito Skipjack Other non-scombroid fish can also cause the illness, including:\nMahi-mahi (Dolphin fish) Amberjack Herring Bluefish Sardines Anchovies These fish species have higher levels of histidine, making them more susceptible to histamine accumulation when mishandled.\nSymptoms of Scombroid Poisoning The symptoms of scombroid poisoning usually appear rapidly, within a few minutes to a few hours after consuming the contaminated fish. Common symptoms include:\nFlushing of the face and upper body Throbbing headache Rapid heartbeat (palpitations) Dizziness Sweating Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal cramps Burning sensation in the mouth Hives (urticaria) or rash Itching Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue The severity of symptoms can vary depending on the amount of histamine ingested. Most people recover within 12-24 hours, but symptoms can sometimes last for several days.\nDiagnosis and Treatment Diagnosis of scombroid poisoning is primarily based on the patient’s symptoms and recent dietary history. If several people who ate the same fish experience similar symptoms, it further supports the diagnosis. While there is no specific test to directly measure histamine levels in the body after the onset of symptoms, testing the implicated fish for histamine can confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment typically involves managing the symptoms. Antihistamines , such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or cimetidine (Tagamet), are often effective in relieving symptoms like flushing, itching, and hives. In severe cases, bronchodilators may be necessary to alleviate breathing difficulties. Oral or intravenous fluids can help prevent dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea. Most importantly, seek medical attention for appropriate diagnosis and symptom management.\nPrevention is Key Preventing scombroid poisoning relies on proper fish handling and storage. This includes:\nImmediate refrigeration: Fish should be refrigerated as soon as possible after being caught or purchased. Maintaining low temperatures: Keep fish at or below 40°F (4.4°C) during storage. Proper handling during processing: Fish processors and handlers must adhere to strict temperature control measures. Avoiding fish with a suspicious odor: Fish with a strong, pungent, or unusual odor should be discarded, even if it appears fresh. Thoroughly cooking fish: Although cooking doesn’t destroy histamine, it’s still crucial for eliminating other potential pathogens. Consumers can play a vital role in prevention by purchasing fish from reputable sources, ensuring that the fish is properly refrigerated at the store, and promptly refrigerating or freezing fish after purchase.\nFAQs About Fish Poisoning 1. How can I tell if fish has gone bad and might cause scombroid poisoning? While some contaminated fish may appear and smell normal, others may have a slightly honeycombed appearance or a pungent, metallic, or peppery odor . If you are unsure, it’s best to err on the side of caution and discard the fish. Relying on visual inspection and smell is not a guarantee however, but it’s the only way the fish will be observed before it is cooked.\n2. Can cooking fish prevent scombroid poisoning? No, cooking does not prevent scombroid poisoning. Histamine is heat-stable and is not destroyed by normal cooking temperatures. Even well-cooked fish can cause illness if histamine levels are high.\n3. How long after eating bad fish do symptoms of scombroid poisoning appear? Symptoms typically appear within a few minutes to a few hours after eating contaminated fish.\n4. What are the long-term effects of scombroid poisoning? Scombroid poisoning is usually a self-limiting illness , with symptoms resolving within 12-24 hours. Long-term effects are rare. However, in rare cases, individuals with underlying health conditions may experience complications.\n5. Is scombroid poisoning an allergic reaction? While the symptoms of scombroid poisoning can resemble those of an allergic reaction , it is not a true allergy. Scombroid poisoning is caused by ingesting high levels of histamine, which directly affects the body’s physiological systems. Fish allergies are a completely different type of condition with an IgE antibody response .\n6. Can frozen fish cause scombroid poisoning? Yes, frozen fish can cause scombroid poisoning if it was improperly handled before freezing. If the fish was allowed to warm up and bacteria produced histamine before it was frozen, the histamine will remain even after the fish is frozen .\n7. Are some people more susceptible to scombroid poisoning than others? People who take certain medications, such as isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis) , or who have conditions that affect histamine metabolism may be more susceptible to the effects of histamine.\n8. How common is scombroid poisoning? Scombroid poisoning is one of the most common types of fish poisoning worldwide. However, the exact incidence is difficult to determine because many cases go unreported.\n9. What is the difference between scombroid poisoning and ciguatera poisoning? Scombroid poisoning is caused by high levels of histamine in fish due to improper storage. Ciguatera poisoning is caused by eating fish that have accumulated toxins produced by marine microalgae. Ciguatera poisoning typically involves neurological symptoms, such as tingling fingers and toes, which are less common in scombroid poisoning.\n10. Is it safe to eat raw fish, like sushi and sashimi? Eating raw fish can pose a risk of various foodborne illnesses, including parasitic infections (like anisakiasis) and bacterial infections (like Salmonella or Listeria). Choose reputable establishments and ensure that the fish is properly handled and stored.\n11. Can you get food poisoning from cooked fish that isn’t scombroid? Yes, cooked fish can cause food poisoning if it is contaminated with bacteria or viruses. Proper cooking can kill many pathogens, but it’s essential to prevent cross-contamination and ensure that fish is stored at safe temperatures.\n12. What other types of food poisoning can you get from fish? Besides scombroid and ciguatera poisoning, fish can also transmit bacterial infections (e.g., Salmonella, Vibrio, Listeria), viral infections (e.g., norovirus), and parasitic infections (e.g., anisakiasis).\n13. What steps can fish processors take to prevent scombroid poisoning? Fish processors should implement strict temperature control measures throughout the handling and processing of fish. This includes immediate refrigeration after catching, maintaining low temperatures during transportation and storage, and regularly monitoring histamine levels.\n14. What should I do if I suspect I have scombroid poisoning? If you suspect you have scombroid poisoning, seek medical attention . Your symptoms should be properly diagnosed, and treatment can be administered.\n15. Where can I find more information about food safety and fish handling? More information about food safety and fish handling can be found on the websites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , and resources like enviroliteracy.org , the website for The Environmental Literacy Council . They offer valuable insights into best practices for safe food handling and consumption.\nBy understanding the causes, symptoms, and prevention methods of scombroid poisoning, you can enjoy seafood safely and minimize the risk of foodborne illness.",
