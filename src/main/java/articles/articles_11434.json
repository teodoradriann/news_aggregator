    "text": "Oprah Winfrey used her influence and popularity for decades to send fans into a frenzy, showering them with surprise gifts and turning them onto favored products and causes. Now Democrats hope she does the same for Kamala Harris. The billionaire media icon will join the Democratic presidential candidate in a live-streamed town hall in Michigan on Thursday, an effort to get out the vote as some states begin distributing absentee and early ballots this month and to potentially sway undecided voters with under 50 days until Election Day. The event teams a trailblazing entrepreneur with a candidate seeking to become the first Black woman US president in what polls show is a tight race against Republican Donald Trump. The event in Michigan, one of three Blue Wall states critical to a Harris victory, will be in the Detroit metro area, where the campaign aims to maximize turnout to drive up statewide totals and counter Trump’s support in rural areas. “It’s not preaching to the choir, it’s getting the choir to sing,” said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, which works to mobilize women of color. “They’re turning up the volume on the urgency of the base to expand and deepen the capacity to win.” - - - Virtual Rally On Thursday, roughly 400 Harris supporters are expected to attend the two-hour event in person with thousands more expected to watch on platforms including YouTube, TikTok and Twitch. The effort is being coordinated by Win With Black Women, which attracted national attention in July for bringing together Harris supporters the night after President Joe Biden exited the race to quickly raise $1.6 million. Jotaka Eaddy, founder of the group, which first worked with Winfrey in 2020, said tens of thousands of people listened to livestreams or calls of that event. Thursday’s “Unite for America” event aims to appeal to a wide variety of voters - more than 140 pro-Harris groups inspired by the success of the virtual gathering for Black women have been working together and are expected to participate, including Win With Black Men, Republicans for Harris and Cat Ladies for Kamala. Winfrey will “convey the importance of this election and how it connects to the day-to-day life of the people who are watching,” Eaddy said. While some members of the participating groups are already highly engaged in the race, others may need “inspiration” from Winfrey, Eaddy said. “It’s about both people who may not have been as motivated to vote and people who are motivated to help mobilize the vote across a wide swath of ethnicities and interests.” - - - Cultural Force Winfrey, worth $5.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, ended her daily talk show in 2011, but remains an influential cultural force. Her early support of Barack Obama is credited with helping him win the 2008 Democratic nomination and she has been more engaged with Harris than any other campaign since. She surprised the Democratic National Convention with a primetime speech endorsing Harris, imploring voters to choose “common sense over nonsense.” “She still has an immense degree of respect and ability to convene people,” said Craig Garthwaite, a professor of strategy at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who co-authored a study about the impact Winfrey’s endorsement had on Obama’s 2008 campaign. Garthwaite found that in addition to her appeal to Black women, Winfrey was “disproportionately” effective in reaching middle-aged White women. Winfrey’s willingness to say she trusted Obama helped move some voters, according to Garthwaite. The study concluded Winfrey helped Obama win one million votes that otherwise would have gone to Clinton in the closely contested primary. “She’s not on TV every day anymore and the media landscape is a lot more fragmented, so she’s probably less influential than she was then but is still powerful,” he said. Winfrey made a surprise appearance on late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s show on Tuesday to promote National Voter Registration Day. While Harris has many prominent surrogates, including Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, Winfrey has the advantage of being seen as less partisan. In her convention speech, Winfrey said she is a registered independent and emphasized Harris’ character more than her policy positions. She ultimately endorsed Clinton in 2016 but did not hold any events for her and never formally backed Biden in 2020. Winfrey did host Biden and Harris for town halls run by her Oprah Winfrey Network – but not Trump. The former president released a book last year that included a private letter Winfrey wrote to him in 2000 in which she says it is “too bad we’re not running for office.” Trump wrote that he still found the former talk show host “amazing” but that “sadly, once I announced for president, she never spoke to me again.” - - - Engaging Voters Winfrey’s involvement will be particularly critical to engaging Black women in their 40s and older, whom Allison called “the glue” of the Harris coalition. Polls show Black women largely back Harris but they can also be influential in encouraging other members of their families and people in their communities to vote, Allison said. Harris led Trump 76% to 12% with Black likely voters in a Suffolk University/USA Today poll conducted in late August. Democrats have expressed worries that more outreach must be done for Black men, a group where Trump has seized on economic anxiety to make inroads. The town hall with Winfrey comes as Harris steps up her media engagements to reach undecided or disengaged voters, an effort where celebrities can help her breakthrough. As part of the new media blitz, Harris taped an interview with Wired on Wednesday. The vice president picked up the support of Taylor Swift after last week’s debate and earlier this week pop star Billie Eilish. The cast of Scandal are reuniting to help launch a bus tour in Michigan focused on protecting abortion rights, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Harris on Wednesday was also joined by actress Chloe Grace Moretz on a call to organize young voters. “There is this belief, historically, that people won’t actually listen to celebrities when it comes to endorsements. I think that’s definitely not true,” Garthwaite said. “They definitely do influence peoples’ voting behavior.”",

Epub 2023 Dec 4. PMID:\n38089182\nLeila Beigom Hejazian\nAluminum (Al) is a popular metal in the industry, and its usage has greatly increased recently. The dose of this metal has been proven to be toxic to rats, but its effects on the offspring of the original receivers and prevention methods to reduce this damage are unknown.is a well-known plant for its high antioxidant capabilities. In this study, the protective effect ofextract (RDA) on aluminum-induced lesions in the brain tissue of a rat offspring was investigated. In this regard, female rats were divided into seven groups, including the control group, the sham group, the aluminum group at the dose of 100 mg/kg, the extract groups at the doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg, and the treatment groups that received the extract and Al at the same doses. After the treatment ended, the offsprings were subjected to exploratory behavioral tests, and finally, the tissues of the brain including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus were pathologically examined. It was observed that RDA at the dose of 1000 mg/kg reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels significantly (<0.0001), while raising the catalase and FRAP indices in Al-treated rats. Moreover, it increased neuronal counts significantly and reduced necrosis and vacuolar degeneration in both the cortex and hippocampus compared to the Al-receiving group. In addition, the administration of RDA 1000 improved the behavioral test scores of the offspring. In conclusion, RDA can effectively reduce Al-induced damage in the brain tissue of the offspring.\n[Rose : CK(476) : AC(262)](/substance/rose) [Aluminum Toxicity : CK(553) : AC(290)](/disease/aluminum-toxicity) [Neuroprotective Agents : CK(10404) : AC(6995)](/pharmacological-action/neuroprotective-agents) [Aluminum Chloride : CK(169) : AC(83)](/toxic-ingredient/aluminum-chloride) [Neurotoxic : CK(2715) : AC(657)](/content/neurotoxic)",

Para ello se realizó una conexión en directo con un reloj programado para el ensayo general proyectado en la espadaña de la parroquia lepera.\nA continuación se proyectó sobre las paredes del mismo templo un espectacular videomapping que hizo bailar, emocionarse y reír a las numerosas personas congregadas para disfrutar del espectáculo, que culminó con una de las intensas y ya tradicionales nevadas que caracterizan la Navidad lepera desde el año 2006 , siendo dicha localidad costera pionera en la provincia de Huelva en la puesta en marcha de esta actividad.",

В компании заявили, что «активно борются с вредоносным контентом, мошенничеством, призывами к диверсиям и насилию» и ежедневно удаляют «миллионы» таких материалов.\nКроме того, сервис впервые ввел «детализированные настройки конфиденциальности для звонков, поэтому каждый пользователь Telegram может определять, от кого принимать звонки, или полностью отключать звонки».\nНакануне Роскомнадзор заявил о «частичном ограничении» звонков в Telegram и WhatsApp*. По словам регулятора, мера нужна для «противодействия преступникам». В Минцифры отметили, что доступ к звонкам восстановят, если сервисы выполнят требования российского законодательства.\n*WhatsApp принадлежит Meta, которая признана в России экстремистской организацией и запрещена.",

    "text": "Owing to our religiosity, sunny disposition and resilient nature, most of us are predisposed to welcome 2024 with much optimism. The poll results from Pulse Asia and Social Weather Stations (SWS) show that a majority does not fear the coming New Year. Never mind that most respondents surveyed by Pulse Asia anticipated a less prosperous Christmas 2023. An earlier SWS survey disclosed that the quality of life worsened for 30 percent of Filipinos in the past 12 months.\nAnother polling firm, Publicus Asia, reported that most people believe that the administration of President Bongbong Marcos Jr. should focus on the economy and the problem of inflation. These are the country’s most pressing macroeconomic issues, according to 15 percent of the respondents. They also want the government to address corruption (12 percent) and poverty (9 percent). On a micro-scale, the public is most anxious about finding employment (14 percent), affordability of basic needs and fear of losing a job (12 percent). In terms of public safety concerns, nine out of 10 Filipinos are worried about the rising criminality and illegal drug use in communities. For the public, economic challenges are interconnected with safety concerns.\nIt seems the Marcos government has their work cut out for them in 2024. Provided that our leaders listen to the sentiments of our kababayans. It is also evident that domestic politics and external security threats, such as the West Philippine Sea (WPS) conflict, rank low on the people’s concerns. Daily survival and improving living conditions are always at the top of their priorities. And regardless if they weigh in on major issues from time to time.\nSumming up Tumultuous. That is the Philippine political scene in 2023. The WPS issue, the widening rift among UniTeam’s pillars, the inflation problem, the assassination of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo and the release of former senator Leila de Lima from detention dominated the national conversation. I will focus on two issues.\nThe year began with the successful state visit of PBBM to China, wherein he discussed the peaceful resolution of the WPS conflict with President Xi Jinping. Days after, the China Coast Guard (CCG) drove away Filipino fishers at the Ayungin Shoal. The CCG continued to attack government and private vessels with water cannons, military-grade lasers and blockades. From then on, the bilateral relations between our nations have gone further south.\nAmerica, the country’s Big Brother, finally broke its non-interference policy on conflicting claims to territories. In May, US President Joe Biden declared his country’s ironclad commitment to defend the Philippines against China. For now, I see this as an empty promise. Where was America when we lost the Panganiban Reef in 1995 and Panatag Shoal in 2012 to the erstwhile Middle Kingdom? Since then, what has the United States done to stop the Asian superpower from bullying us? Threatened by China’s increasing economic and military might, their leaders are suddenly invoking the Mutual Defense Treaty. In my view, the US does not believe the Philippine sovereign claims to the disputed WPS features. America is merely exploiting the sorry state of our military defense relative to the WPS conflict to curtail China’s ascendancy in the Indo-Pacific. Very simply, the US wants to impose its hegemonic influence in the region.\nOur history with China through the centuries and before our colonization is one of peaceful trade and cooperation. Historically, we never had any military conflict with the superpower. During the time of president Rodrigo Duterte, we were able to maintain friendly ties with both China and the US. Why must we change the status quo to accommodate America’s vested interests? Unfortunately, I heard that the President has been receiving advice from a public relations professional with strong links with the US embassy. Thus, the balance has increasingly tilted in Uncle Sam’s favor. For our national economic interest, I urge the government to continue forging closer relations with China so that we can benefit from the country’s prosperity and development.\nAnother major controversy is the internal squabbling within the UniTeam alliance. The rift between Vice President Sara Duterte and House Speaker Martin Romualdez seems irreconcilable at this point. The root cause: the Lower House leadership removed former president and current Pampanga Representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as senior deputy speaker.\nAccording to my sources, Romualdez accused GMA of possessing Articles of Impeachment against PBBM, who was then concurrent head of the Department of Agriculture. It is related to the controversial Sugar Order (SO) No. 6, which became the subject of my Feb. 25 column. I wrote that the government allowed the entry of 450,000 metric tons of imported sugar to our shores sans a sugar order; favored three importers that were pre-selected in January and breached the selection process of allocation to importers. I have copies of the letters submitted by the said companies to the President through the office of Speaker Romualdez. The seasoned politician that she is, GMA would not try to unseat a popular chief executive. Further, PBBM has referred to Arroyo as his “secret weapon” in several official overseas trips. I also believe her assertion that she is not interested in becoming Speaker again. Therefore, GMA was unjustly accused and stripped of her previous post.\nAs a result of the Lower House drama, Inday Sara resigned as Lakas-CMD party chair and member. She also dropped the infamous “tambaloslos” word, which incensed Martin and his followers. As payback, the Lower House disapproved Sara’s confidential fund request for the Office of the Vice President and Department of Education. As early as September, impeachment rumors against the VP became rife in Congress. Later on, two congressmen sponsored resolutions calling on the Executive to cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation of the drug war campaign. The representatives of the alleged victims have accused FPRRD and Inday Sara of complicity with the extralegal killings of individuals linked to illegal drugs.\nPreviously, I disclosed that PBBM is seriously considering cooperating with the ICC Prosecutor. Apparently, he was dismayed by allegations that FPRRD and retired military generals were plotting to remove him from power. In my opinion, the story is pure hogwash. Digong knows that if the military stages a coup d’etat, there will be extraconstitutional changes in the government. Both the President and VP Sara would lose their mandate. Why would a former president willingly destroy a nation he painstakingly brought to greater socio-economic heights? Would a loving father destroy the political career of his favorite daughter?\nThe state of Philippine politics in 2023 is both saddening and maddening. I wish 2024 will be a year of understanding, healing and reconciliation for the nation. A prosperous New Year to us all!",
