    "text": "Washington plans to kill brook trout in Pend Oreille County creek\nWashington fisheries officials want brook trout out of a creek in Pend Oreille County to make more room for native westslope cutthroats.\nThe Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife announced this week plans for poisoning Upper West Branch LeClerc Creek over the next three years to kill non-native eastern brook trout so the stream can be replanted with westslope cutthroats sourced from the same area.\nBrook and cutthroat trout occupy some of the same parts of the stream, but the species don’t mix well. Brook trout outcompete the native fish for food and habitat, and they are known to take over streams entirely.\nKenneth Behen, WDFW’s warmwater fish program manager, said in a statement that the presence of brook trout “has led to westslope cutthroat trout population declines throughout their range due to competition between the two species.”\nA virtual public meeting on the project is planned for Monday evening at 6 p.m. Public comment is open until 5 p.m. on May 20.\nIf approved by the WDFW director, work would begin this summer with crews salvaging cutthroat and bull trout from the stream before using a naturally occurring fish poison to kill the remaining brook trout. Treatments would take place annually through 2027.\nThe project is the latest in a series of efforts between WDFW and the Kalispel Tribe to restore native species and their habitat in tributaries of the Pend Oreille River. Other projects have taken place along the creeks of Washington’s portion of the Selkirk Range, including Cee Cee Ah Creek.\nRestoration work is a requirement of the county Public Utility District’s federal permit for operating Box Canyon Dam. Project documents cite a permit requirement for a Trout Habitat Restoration Program, which calls for restoring 164 miles of stream in the area.\nThe LeClerc Creek watershed was identified as a top priority. The first phase of the work on the Upper West Branch began in 2020, with crews surveying the stream with electrofishing gear and DNA sampling to determine fish distribution in the mainstem and in its tributaries.\nBrook and westslope cutthroat trout were found in the stream, though there were places where brook trout had pushed all the cutthroat out, according to WDFW documents.\nA temporary fish management structure was put in place in 2023 to separate the project area from the rest of the drainage. The treatment will take place on an 8.3-mile stretch upstream from the structure.\nWDFW plans to poison the creek with rotenone, a piscicide derived from the roots of tropical plants that’s commonly used in fish restoration projects. It’s been used on other streams in northeast Washington and was used last fall on West Medical Lake.\nBefore the first treatment, up to 1,500 cutthroats will be salvaged and taken to the Seattle City Light Native Salmonid Conservation Facility near Usk, according to WDFW’s plans.\nThe fish will be held and spawned there over three to five years. Their progeny will be the fish that can be returned to the stream once DNA sampling shows brook trout have been completely removed.",

She's already teased the release of her sustainable fashion tech platform, attended fashion weeks around the globe, and become an outspoken social activist. Oh, and last the world heard, she's dating Paul McCartney's grandson.\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account?

LUDOVIC MARIN/Contributor/AFP via Getty Images Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates, who married in 1994 and divorced in 2021, have three children: Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25, and Phoebe, 22. The children all went to Seattle's Lakeside School , a private high school their father also attended, and are now on different trajectories.\nJennifer is a decorated equestrian who graduated from medical school in May, while Rory is a congressional analyst, according to a 2023 Puck report. While her brother stays out of the spotlight, Phoebe is sharing her life online, and has ambitions in the fashion industry.\nThe three Gates children will inherit at least some of their parents' wealth: Bill Gates has said he plans to leave them \"only\" $10 million each .\n\"I definitely think leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them ,\" Gates said in a 2013 Reddit \"Ask Me Anything.\" \"Warren Buffett was part of an article in Fortune talking about this in 1986 before I met him, and it made me think about it and decide he was right.\"\nToday, nearly five decades after cofounding Microsoft, Bill Gates has an estimated fortune of $139 billion, Forbes reported in September. He left Microsoft's board in 2020 — although is still reportedly \" intimately involved \" at the company — and has remained focused on the Gates Foundation, which he once ran with French Gates . She also became a billionaire following their divorce.\nAdvertisement She shares glimpses of her parents on her social media pages, which have accumulated hundreds of thousands of followers.

Patrick McMullan/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images As of September 2024, Phoebe Gates has 474,000 followers on Instagram and 243,300 followers on TikTok.\nA day after posting a video of her sharing bubble tea with her dad in October 2023, she gained over 59,000 TikTok followers, according to analytics website Social Blade .\n\"Father-daughter bubble tea time,\" read a caption under the TikTok post.\nIn the clip, which has received 16.9 million views on TikTok and uses \"As It Was\" by Harry Styles as a backing track, Phoebe sits opposite her billionaire father as they both poke straws into cups of bubble tea and smile at one another overlooking a Manhattan skyline.\nBill Gates has made appearances on other creators' TikTok accounts in the past, often participating in math or art challenges, although he does not have an account himself.\nPhoebe Gates has also shared moments with her mom, most recently posting a birthday tribute on Instagram in August. Beneath a carousel of recent and childhood photos, she wrote, \"Mom, you taught me first and most about love. You inspire me forever, and always, and now the whole world. Happiest birthday to you.\"\nAdvertisement Gates graduated from Stanford University in June, and she has previously vlogged about her college life. Phoebe Gates at a 2024 New York Fashion Week event. Christian Vierig/Contributor/Getty Images While studying at Stanford, Gates showcased her dorm room and filmed vlog-style updates about her life at college. In one TikTok posted in December 2022, she filmed herself riding a bike to a stats class, and later showed herself making a very student-esque pasta dish for dinner.\nIn June 2024, she graduated after just three years, telling Nylon , \"I knew I had to make it happen if I could, because I wanted to watch my mother deliver this year's commencement speech as a graduate. I can't think of a better ending!\"\nGates blogged her graduation day with the outlet, sharing that she celebrated the milestone with a party attended by her mom, dad, and boyfriend Arthur Donald, the 25-year-old grandson of Paul McCartney.\n\"So grateful to have my parents by my side on this day,\" she wrote.\nAdvertisement She is passionate about sustainable fashion and is pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities in the industry with her own platform, Phia. Sophia Kianni and Phoebe Gates are the founders of the fashion-tech company Phia. John Lamparski/Stringer/Getty Images for Roc Nation On TikTok, Gates has previously posted about attending fashion week in Copenhagen and New York. She has also shared informational clips about sustainable fashion and promoted buying secondhand clothes.\nIn August 2023, Vogue reported that Gates is co-launching her own fashion platform, called Phia, with her fellow Stanford student and roommate Sophia Kianni (pictured above left).\nThat month, the duo landed a partnership with Stella McCartney and her namesake fashion house, designing a capsule collection of handbags in honor of the US Open's 50th anniversary.\nGates told Vogue, \"Stella has been able to build this empire while still holding onto her values. We reached out many times, and eventually, she really took us under her wing and has since been an advisor to us as we build out this platform.\"\nKianni also added, \"We want to identify everyone who is doing incredible things, learn from them, and see how we can accelerate progress together.\"\nAs of September 2024, the company has upward of 43,000 followers on Instagram with the bio, \"The smartest way to shop. Follow to find out.\"\nSo far, Phia has shared moodboards, outfit inspiration carousels, and secondhand fashion finds.\nAdvertisement Following in her parents' footsteps, Gates is an outspoken social activist.

Gotham/WireImage/Getty Images The 22-year-old appears to be taking after her parents, especially her mother, who has advocated for access to birth control around the world for many years. One of the topics Gates has frequently addressed on her TikTok and Instagram pages is reproductive health and advocating for abortion rights.\nShe's posted TikToks of herself speaking about access to contraception at events, including Goalkeepers, hosted by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and shared resources on her Instagram.\nIn January 2023, Phoebe shared a TikTok where she and her mom discussed women's access to contraceptives.\n\"So you're a huge advocate for contraceptives,\" Phoebe said to her mom. \"I mean, you've always hammered this into me since I was a child, about deciding for my body and having body autonomy.\"\nIn December 2023, the mother-daughter pair shared another conversation on TikTok where Phoebe explained why she's an advocate for reproductive health.\n\"I think for me, coming for age in this country, our generation has been put in a spot where a lot of times we feel quite a bit powerless,\" she said. \"You know, not having the freedom to make choices about your own reproductive health, your own ... your very own body.\"\nAdvertisement In September 2024, Phoebe was featured in an episode of her father's Netflix documentary series, \"What's Next? The Future With Bill Gates.\" Phoebe was featured in Netflix's new documentary series, \"What's Next? The Future With Bill Gates.\" Nina Westervelt/Variety/Penske Media via Getty Images Phoebe Gates was featured on the series' second episode, \"Truth or Consequences?\" She spoke with her father about social media and misinformation.\nShe said she sees conspiracy theories about him online \"all the time,\" and shared, \"I've even had friends cut me off because of these vaccine rumors .\"\nThe pair also shared a funny generation-gap moment when the senior Gates asked, \"And how many IDs do you typically have on a system?\" His confused daughter replied, \"How many what?\" which led to Bill offering clarification so she could explain that yes, people often have multiple accounts on the same social media platforms, such as a public one and a \"spam\" for close friends.\nPhoebe Gates went on to describe her social media strategy, saying that she understands people often come to her page because of her last name but likes to add information about reproductive health and justice in her posts.\n\"It's a fine line between being personable but then also weaving in your real agenda. OK, here's the numbers, here's the science, here's the facts,\" she said.\nThe pair finished their conversation with an important reminder for the father of three: \"Text me, don't email me,\" Phoebe Gates said. \"No one uses email for personal communications.\"\nAdvertisement In June, she confirmed she's dating Paul McCartney's grandson, Arthur.

Alongside one of the images, she joked that he \"cleans up nicely,\" while in another, he carried her on his back.\nDonald, 25, is the oldest of Paul McCartney's eight grandchildren, People reported. He is the son of the Beatles' star's daughter, Mary, and her ex-husband, Alistair Donald.\nHe grew up in London and attended Yale University. He is an investor at the Collaborative Fund, a venture capital firm \"for entrepreneurs pushing the world forward,\" according to its website.\nGates and Donald were also pictured together at the premiere of \"Feud: Capote vs. The Swans\" held in New York City in January.\nRead next Bill Gates Billionaires Advertisement Close icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.

    "title": "Mikel Arteta must face harsh truth after Arsenal fail to react to fresh VAR controversy - John Cross",
    "text": "The sense of injustice is killing Arsenal’s challenge. And yet they were the ones shooting themselves in the foot as they failed to reclaim pole position in the title race.\nWe will be talking forever about whether the ball crossed the line in the build-up to Tomas Soucek’s opener as West Ham shocked Arsenal at the Emirates . VAR could not find any conclusive proof to show the ball was out of play so they stuck with referee Michael Oliver’s on-field decision to give the goal.\nYou can find angles and dodgy illustrations on the internet to supposedly prove it was out and it will only add to the conspiracy theories about devious plots to derail Arsenal's title challenge. But the reality is that the goal was scored in the 13th minute and they had plenty of time to come back but could not find a way through and it must go down as Arsenal’s worst performance of the season.\nInstead, West Ham , who defended brilliantly, were the ones who got a second as former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos headed in to compound the agony and wasted opportunity. It could have been worse as Declan Rice - of all people - conceded a penalty for a trip on Emerson deep into injury time but Said Behrahma saw his spot kick saved by Arsenal keeper David Raya.\nMikel Arteta stood on the touchline, soaked by the rain in North London, stewing on Arsenal’s third defeat of the season and will no doubt feel aggrieved that VAR technology could not prove decisively one way or another. But one thing that was clear and obvious was Arsenal’s need for a proper striker, a real No9 to put in the sitters which Gabriel Jesus wasted from point blank range.\nTitle races are decided by small margins and slip-ups are not allowed because Liverpool stay top and Manchester City are certain to click into top gear at some stage. Arsenal looked flat, tired and dejected as they ran out of steam and energy once West Ham went ahead.\nDid Arsenal deserve their defeat? Have your say in the comments section\nThe squad does look thin and in need of fresh legs. It is all very well for Arteta to demand the fans turn up the volume and create a big atmosphere but the players have to deliver as well and the truth is they have not hit top gear this season.\nIt all went wrong from the moment of controversy. West Ham full back Emerson swung over a cross from the left, Arsenal defenders Gabriel and Oleksandr Zinchenko got themselves in a mess and Jarrod Bowen pulled the ball back.\nThere was Soucek to force home. The visitors went wild but celebrations had to be put on hold for what felt like an eternity because of a lengthy VAR check. Bowen’s body was blocking the view and, try as they might, the VAR could not find a definitive angle. Nor could TV to show the viewers. So the goal stood.\nArteta was furious after Arsenal’s defeat at Newcastle when they could not prove the ball went out of play before Anthony Gordon’s winner and it felt like history was repeating itself. But Arsenal could not lift themselves. Bukayo Saka's header forced a terrific save from West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola. Saka also hit the post.\nThen disaster struck as Mavropanos headed in James Ward-Prowse’s 55th minute corner. He did not celebrate out of respect for his old club when, frankly, most fans had forgotten he played for Arsenal.\nTwice, Jesus missed gilt edged headed chances, putting one over the crossbar and the other straight at Areola as it just was not Arsenal’s night.\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

The warning will come into effect from 11am on Saturday, December 30 and end at 3am on Sunday, December 31. The [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-warnings#?date=2023-12-31&id=93aafe71-7b22-4a62-b51b-557ecbe093fb) warning reads: \"A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services. \"Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely. \"It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves. \"Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer. \"Some short term loss of power and other services is possible. \"Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely.\" The Met Office's five tips for staying safe in strong wind. - Check for loose items outside your home and plan how you could secure them in high winds. - Plan your route before driving, and keep essentials such as a blanket and food in your car. - Try to avoid driving where possible. If you must drive, keep to a slow speed and ensure to leave extra space to cyclists, motorcyclists, buses, and lorries. - If you live on the coast, check forecasts and tides in your local area, and beware of large waves. - Stay indoors as much as possible. Avoid walking near buildings and trees if outside due to possible debris.

Na última segunda-feira (17), manteve a rotina de telefonar para a paróquia da Sagrada Família, na Faixa de Gaza, para se atualizar sobre a situação no enclave palestino. (ANSA).",

    "title": "\"Asteroid 2024 CY1 Safely Passes Between Earth and Moon in Close Encounter\" - World Today News",
    "text": "Asteroid 2024 CY1 Safely Passes Between Earth and Moon in Close Encounter In a thrilling celestial event, an asteroid named 2024 CY1 made a close pass between Earth and the Moon on Monday. This small car-sized space rock, measuring only about 4 to 8 meters in diameter, flew by at a distance of approximately 121,000 kilometers, which is nearly a third of the distance between our planet and its natural satellite. The close approach occurred at around 7.24 GMT, as reported by the Virtual Telescope Project. The discovery of this asteroid marks the tenth time this year that astronomers have observed an asteroid passing within 1 lunar distance of Earth. It is also the third such encounter to happen in February alone. Fortunately, experts have assured us that this particular asteroid did not pose any risk to our planet. This recent close encounter comes on the heels of another exciting event last month when astronomers detected an asteroid hurtling towards Earth just hours before it entered our atmosphere. Named 2024 BXI, the space rock disintegrated harmlessly in the skies above Berlin, creating a mesmerizing fireball. This incident marked only the eighth time that an asteroid had been spotted shortly before its impact. Enthusiastic space lovers even managed to recover fragments of the rock around Berlin. Earlier this year, we witnessed an asteroid roughly the size of a skyscraper safely passing by Earth at a distance of about 1.7 million miles. Although classified as “potentially hazardous” due to its size, it posed no immediate danger as it passed by at a distance approximately seven times greater than that between Earth and the Moon. While astronomers have discovered around 25,000 asteroids capable of wiping out entire cities, the European Space Agency (ESA) believes that there could be as many as a million asteroids in the size range of 30 to 100 meters near Earth, with the majority of them still undiscovered. This realization has prompted space agencies and governments worldwide to intensify their efforts in spotting potentially hazardous objects and developing strategies to protect our planet. One such initiative is the ESA’s Neomir, an orbiting observatory currently under development. Expected to launch around 2030, Neomir will be positioned between the Sun and Earth, serving as an early warning system for asteroids. Its primary objective is to detect and track these celestial bodies, providing crucial data for future mitigation efforts. As we continue to explore the vast expanse of space, it is essential to remain vigilant and proactive in identifying potential threats. The close encounter of asteroid 2024 CY1 serves as a reminder of the importance of ongoing research and development in safeguarding our planet from the perils that lurk beyond our atmosphere. With initiatives like Neomir on the horizon, we can look forward to a future where humanity is better equipped to navigate the cosmic dangers that lie in wait.
