    "text": "Il topo che riordina ogni notte il tavolo da lavoro di un pensionato gallese [VIDEO]\nAGI – Ogni mattina, da due mesi, Rodney Holbrook trovava misteriosamente in ordine gli oggetti lasciati sparsi la sera prima sul tavolo del suo garage. Colpito dal bizzarro fenomeno, il settantacinquenne, residente in un paesino del Galles, decise quindi di installare una telecamera per poi scoprire che era un topo a sistemare mollette, viti, bulloni e tappi di sughero in una scatola lasciata sul banco.\n“All’inizio ho notato che del cibo che stavo distribuendo agli uccelli finiva in alcune vecchie scarpe che stavo conservando nel capannone”, ha raccontato Holbrook alla Bbc, “novantanove volte su 100 il topo riordina tutta la notte. È davvero incredibile che rimetta tutto nella scatola, forse si diverte”.\nL’ex postino e fotografo dilettante ritiene che il roditore utilizzi gli oggetti per nascondere le noci e ha provato a fare qualche esperimento, lasciando sul tavolo le cose più disparate per vedere se l’animale riuscisse a sollevarle. E la convivenza va a gonfie vele. “Non mi prendo la briga di mettere in ordine adesso, lascio le cose fuori dalla scatola e lui le rimetterà al loro posto entro la mattina”, ha spiegato.\nNon è la prima volta che Holbrook si imbatte in un topo così organizzato. Quando viveva a Bristol nel 2019,un suo amico gli aveva chiesto aiuto per riparare una telecamera notturna e insieme avevano scoperto e ripreso un altro topo che teneva in ordine una stalla. “Quel video è diventato virale e ha raggiunto persone in tutto il mondo”, ha ricordato, “non posso credere che qui a Builth Wells sia successa la stessa cosa anni dopo.”",

    "title": "Scotland set for 20cm of snow this weekend as second 'ferocious' storm could hit",
    "text": "Scotland could be hit by a deluge of snow this weekend when a second storm could strike just days after Storm Gerrit.\nAfter thousands were left without power this week due to stormy conditions, more unsettled weather could be on the way due to a powerful Atlantic jet stream.\nMet Office forecasters say ‘treacherous conditions’ could hit Scotland on Saturday, bringing gusts of up to 60mph and 20cm of snow on northern hills.\nThis weather front could lead to a further winter storm, set to be named Storm Henk, according to senior meteorologist Jim Dale of the British Weather Services. The weather expert told i that this storm bring “ferocious” winds and “may cause far more chaos” than Storm Gerrit.\nHe told the publication: “I encourage anyone travelling on New Year’s Eve to do so sooner rather than later on Sunday as these winds will be ferocious.”\nMet Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern warned that this ‘powerful system’ could bring similar heavy rainfall to Storm Gerrit and ‘very significant snow’ when it reaches Scotland.\nSpeaking about the 10-day weather forecast, he said: “Storm Gerrit is moving away by this stage, but another lowest forming out of the Atlantic again picked up by a powerful Jetstream and deepening rapidly as it approaches Ireland and the UK during Friday night and into Saturday.”\nHe added: “So the recipe there once again for some substantial snow over northern hills predominantly. But across Scotland certainly over the southern uplands and then into the highlands and Grampians some very significant snow building up through Saturday, 20cm plus over the tops of the mountains. So once again some treacherous conditions with the wind, rain and hills snow to contend with on Saturday. Tricky day for travelling in many places certainly.”\nScotland could be hit by a deluge of snow this weekend\nThe Met Office also warned that New Year’s Eve could be wet and windy, with heavy rain forecast across most of the UK. Milder conditions are expected in southern UK areas, while cold temperatures will remain in Scotland.\nIt comes after a ‘major incident’ was declared in Scotland due to Storm Gerrit, with a string of weather warnings issued on Wednesday.\nThousands of homes remain without power and motorists and rail passengers face continued disruption after Storm Gerrit battered the country.\nEngineers worked to restore power to around 14,000 customers, though Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution warned some could be without supply into Friday.\nHigh winds, heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country while a Met Office yellow weather warning was in force across much of Scotland throughout Wednesday.\nThe weather conditions also disrupted travel, with some drivers trapped for hours on the A9 which was closed at Drumtocher in the Highlands due to snow.\nOn the railways, many routes remain closed and will not reopen until safety checks have been carried out.\nDon’t miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

    "title": "I Tested Ninja's New Glass-Bowl Air Fryer and Now I'm Tossing My Old One",
    "text": "I Tested Ninja's New Glass-Bowl Air Fryer and Now I'm Tossing My Old One\nThe Ninja Crispi's glass cooking chamber doubles as a carrying container, allows you to see food while it's cooking, and comes clean as a whistle. I think I'm in love.\nPros\n- Cook, serve, and storage capabilities\n- Easy to clean: almost everything is dishwasher-safe\n- Intuitive operation\n- No concern about PFAS\n- Ability to see cooking in progress\n- Can buy additional glass vessels for maximum food prep\n- Small storage footprint with nesting capabilities\n- Portable\nCons\n- Price is on the high side for air fryers\n- Some exposed hot elements during operation\nNinja has been making some of our favorite small appliances for over a decade. The brand's latest countertop oven features a glass-bowl bottom, easy controls and a cooking chamber that doubles as food storage and transport. In short: the Ninja Crispi might be the best darn air fryer we've tested.\nNinja's Crispi ($160) with interchangeable 6-cup and 4-quart glass cooking chambers so you can watch your food as it crisps to perfection. The glass bowl doubles as a portable container for transport immediately after cooking and get cleaner than nonstick baskets could ever. The shift away from nonstick also eliminates any worry of the chemical coating seeping into food and causing Teflon Flu.\nSafety and cleanliness are big, but the real star of the Ninja Crispi, however, turned out to be its versatility: cooking, serving and storage all in one vessel. Meal preppers especially take note: here's everything you need to know about the Ninja Crispi and why it just might be the best air fryer we've tested.\nNinja Crispi 4-in-1 Portable Glass Air Fryer at a glance\n- Style: modular air fryer with two different sizes of glass cooking vessels and a separate cooking pod in three different color options\n- Dimensions: 13.5 inches x 12 inches x 13.5 inches\n- Watts: 1,500\n- Weight: 15.74 pounds\n- Price $160\nNinja Crispi setup\nDespite not looking anything like a typical air fryer, the Ninja Crispi was intuitive to set up and use. Each of the glass cooking vessels has a built-in stand with feet that keeps it off the counter surface. Side handles are also fitted on the stands of the bowls, which allow not only for easy transporting between the counter and the table (since the vessels can also be used to serve) but also make it easy to shake the contents as needed during the cooking process. The nonstick crisper plates were packaged separately and simple to place inside the bowls and to remove for cleaning. Lids for both the 6-cup and 4-quart bowls were also included: a snap-on lid for the smaller and a simpler press-on lid for the larger.\nThe cooking pod itself has an ergonomic shape for easy lifting and also has feet for safe placement on the counter when not in use.The cooking pod sits easily on top of the 6-cup bowl, and a big batch adapter frame fits the cooking pod onto the larger bowl. Between unwrapping and rinsing all of the washable parts, I was ready to go in about 2 minutes.\nNinja Crispi operation\nThe cooking pod itself includes crisp, bake, air fry and max crisp functions. Crisp is intended to revive leftovers, while max crisp is the ideal setting for packaged frozen foods. While it is tempting, given its baking dish look, the glass TempWare bowls are not intended to be used as the actual cooking vessels for batters in bake mode, since air still needs to circulate below the cooking vessels in order to be effective. (Will I try anyway? The temptation is real…)\nPressing any button will indicate a digital timer to which you can add or subtract minutes. (The timer defaults to 10.) Below 1 minute, the timer changes into seconds, and the device beeps to alert you when the cycle is done. Overall the sound level of the Ninja Crispi was similar to conventional air fryer models, with just a moderate whir when operating.\nWhat I liked about the Ninja Crispi\nAs expected, the ability to see the cooking in progress was really satisfying, both from a nerdy perspective and also to be able to look for visual cues in terms of when to flip your items or to assess doneness. Both chicken parts and Brussels sprouts were cooked evenly and efficiently with very little risk of over-cooking given the 360-degree window into the proceedings.\nThe versatility, however, makes the Ninja Crispi tremendously interesting, especially for avid meal preppers. Full meals or individual cooked components can go right from cooking into the fridge, with the included lids for easy storage. (Though I am bound by refrigerator logistics to tell you to let it all cool first, so you don't inadvertently raise the temperature inside your fridge.)\nAdditional cooking bowls in a variety of sizes can also be purchased separately, allowing for the possibility of a multitude of individually cooked meals with no cleanup required in between usage: just transfer the cooking pod from one cooking vessel to the next, assembly-line style. Sunday meal prep has never been easier, nor required fewer dishes.\nThe Ninja Crispi is also easy to store, with a footprint and height requirement that is far less than a lot of conventional models. It also makes for easy portability -- ideal for a potluck situation or even just a hot-meal self-care moment -- where you could even justify cooking on site. Either of the cooking bowls and the cooking pod could easily fit in a shoulder bag. If I worked in an office, it would thrill me to bring the whole thing with me to have a hot, healthy lunch without reheating. Though if you're contemplating being the person to cook fish directly at your desk: maybe don't.\nNot only can the larger 4-quart bowl be used directly as a family-style serving vessel -- whose practical feet preclude the need for a trivet or pot holder -- but one could argue that the smaller 4-cup vessel can be used to eat out of directly, significantly reducing the number of dishes to wash. Speaking of washing, everything except the cooking pod itself is dishwasher safe.\nWhat I didn't like about the Ninja Crispi\nAs a modular device with a ton of built-in practicality and versatility, I do think the Ninja Crispi is a game changer in the air fryer space. That being said, at $160 it's on the higher side, price wise, for air fryers.\nThose with little ones in the house may also want to take note, when the cooking pod is being used with the adapter for large batches, the adapter can become hot and is potentially exposed once the heating pod is removed. Never minding little ones, if you're an absent-minded cook yourself, it can be a hazard.\nRead more: 8 Foods That Go From Good to Great in an Air Fryer\nFinal verdict on the Ninja Crispi\nIf you're a disciple of air fryer cooking, and especially if you are someone with a serious commitment to meal prepping, the Ninja Crispi is arguably one of the most versatile models on the market. It is satisfying to use and easy to store and clean. I may look for it on sale during Prime Days or the like, but even without a discount, its utility and the reputation of the Ninja brand merits its price tag.",

    "text": "The captain of an IndiGo flight, en route to Goa from Delhi, made an emergency landing at Mumbai airport on Wednesday evening after issuing a 'PAN PAN' call, according to a report by the Hindustan Times . The phrase 'PAN PAN' refers to a radio message used to signal an urgent situation that needs prompt attention but does not pose an immediate threat to life. The Airbus A320neo aircraft, carrying 191 passengers, departed from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and was bound for Goa Airport when a mid-air engine complication forced it to make an emergency landing. The plane landed without incident at 9:53 pm in Mumbai. Airport authorities in Mumbai reported that the event occurred approximately 100 nautical miles north of Bhubaneswar. One of the officials was quoted as saying that the pilot had declared \"PAN PAN PAN\" due to a malfunction in engine number 1. IndiGo, however, attributed the diversion to a technical fault. A company spokesperson stated, “A technical snag was detected on flight 6E 6271 while flying from Delhi to Manohar International Airport, Goa on 16 July 2025. Following procedures, the aircraft was diverted and landed in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai.” Air India crash renews focus on cockpit video recorders The IndiGo incident occurred just over a month after the Air India crash in Ahmedabad, which resulted in the deaths of all but one of the 242 passengers on board, along with 19 people on the ground. It marked the most severe aviation disaster India has seen in a decade. This tragedy has reignited an ongoing industry debate regarding the implementation of cockpit video recorders to supplement existing cockpit voice and flight data recorders used in crash investigations. Proponents argue that video footage could address gaps left by audio and data logs, while critics express concerns about privacy violations and the potential misuse of such recordings, asserting that the added value to investigations is minimal. Touchdown scare at Patna airport Earlier on July 15, another IndiGo aircraft experienced a moment of tension at Patna’s Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport. Flight 6E 2482, which was arriving from Delhi with 173 passengers, momentarily touched down before taking off again. The pilot assessed that there might not be adequate runway remaining for a secure halt and opted to initiate a go-around. The aircraft circled the vicinity briefly before safely landing. According to airport officials, both flight operations and passenger handling continued without disruption. Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "text": "What Happens If You Use Too Much Fish Fertilizer? Using too much fish fertilizer , while seemingly harmless given its organic nature, can lead to significant problems for your plants and soil. The primary issue is nitrogen burn , where an excess of nitrogen in the soil damages plant roots and foliage. This manifests as scorched leaf tips, yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and in severe cases, plant death. The excess nitrogen disrupts the plant’s ability to absorb water and other essential nutrients, ultimately hindering its health and productivity. Additionally, over-application can lead to a buildup of salts in the soil, creating an inhospitable environment for beneficial microbes and further exacerbating nutrient imbalances. While fish fertilizer is a fantastic tool for enriching your garden, moderation and careful application are key to reaping its benefits without harming your plants.\nUnderstanding Fish Fertilizer and Its Benefits Before diving into the dangers of overuse, let’s quickly recap why fish fertilizer is so popular. This organic fertilizer is derived from fish parts and is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) , along with valuable micronutrients. It’s a gentle and effective way to nourish plants, promote healthy growth, and improve soil structure. Unlike synthetic fertilizers, fish fertilizer releases nutrients slowly, reducing the risk of burning plants when used correctly. The slow release of nutrients, alongside the beneficial microbes it introduces to the soil, makes it a favourite among gardeners looking for a sustainable and natural approach.\nThe Downside of Over-Fertilizing with Fish Emulsion While fish emulsion is generally considered a mild fertilizer , applying too much can have detrimental effects. The most common issue is nitrogen burn , which occurs when the soil becomes overloaded with nitrogen. This excess nitrogen draws water out of the plant, leading to dehydration and damage.\nSigns of Over-Fertilization Recognizing the signs of over-fertilization early can help you mitigate the damage. Keep an eye out for these telltale indicators:\nCrust of fertilizer on soil surface: This is a clear sign of excessive fertilizer application. Yellowing and wilting of lower leaves: This indicates nutrient imbalances and stress. Browning leaf tips and margins: This is a classic symptom of nitrogen burn. Browned or blackened limp roots: Damaged roots are unable to absorb water and nutrients effectively. Defoliation: The plant sheds its leaves in an attempt to conserve energy. Very slow or no growth: The plant’s growth is stunted due to stress. Death of seedlings: Young, vulnerable plants are particularly susceptible to over-fertilization. The Impact on Soil Health Over-fertilizing not only harms plants but also disrupts the delicate balance of the soil ecosystem. Excessive fertilizer can kill beneficial microbes, which play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and making nutrients available to plants. This can lead to soil imbalances and a decline in overall soil health. The Environmental Literacy Council offers valuable resources about soil health and sustainable practices; be sure to check out enviroliteracy.org for more information.\nAttracting Pests and Diseases Over-fertilized plants are often stressed and weakened, making them more vulnerable to pests and diseases. Sap-sucking insects, such as aphids and spider mites, are particularly attracted to plants with high nitrogen levels. These pests can further weaken the plant and spread diseases.\nHow to Fix Over-Fertilization If you suspect that you’ve over-fertilized your plants with fish emulsion, take immediate action to rectify the situation.\nFlush the soil: Thoroughly water the affected plants to leach out excess fertilizer. Repeat this process several times over the next few days. Remove the crust: Carefully remove any visible crust of fertilizer from the soil surface. Improve drainage: Ensure that your pots or garden beds have adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging. Transplant if necessary: If the plant is severely affected, consider transplanting it into fresh, unfertilized soil. Monitor soil pH: Test the soil pH and adjust it if necessary. Fish emulsion can affect soil pH, so it’s important to maintain a balanced environment. Preventing Over-Fertilization Prevention is always better than cure. Follow these tips to avoid over-fertilizing your plants with fish emulsion:\nRead the label carefully: Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding dilution rates and application frequency. Test your soil: Before applying any fertilizer, test your soil to determine its nutrient levels. This will help you avoid over-supplying certain nutrients. Start small: When using fish emulsion for the first time, start with a lower concentration and gradually increase it as needed. Apply infrequently: Fish emulsion is a slow-release fertilizer, so you don’t need to apply it as often as synthetic fertilizers. Typically, every 3 weeks during the growing season is sufficient. Observe your plants: Pay close attention to your plants and adjust your fertilization schedule based on their needs. Consider other soil amendments: Fish emulsion is just one tool in your gardening arsenal. Consider using other soil amendments, such as compost and worm castings, to improve soil health and provide a balanced supply of nutrients. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Fish Fertilizer 1. Can you use too much fish fertilizer? Yes, you absolutely can! While fish fertilizer is a mild, organic option , over-application can lead to nitrogen burn, salt buildup in the soil, and overall plant stress. Always follow the recommended dilution rates and application frequency.\n2. Should I water after applying fish fertilizer? Yes, watering after applying fish fertilizer is generally recommended. It helps to wash the fertilizer into the soil and distribute the nutrients evenly to the roots. It can also help to reduce the pungent smell associated with some fish-based fertilizers.\n3. How often can you fertilize with fish fertilizer? A general guideline is to apply fish fertilizer every 3 weeks during the growing season. However, the frequency may vary depending on the type of plant, soil conditions, and the plant’s needs. Always observe your plants and adjust your fertilization schedule accordingly.\n4. What are the side effects of using too much fertilizer? Using too much fertilizer, including fish emulsion , can lead to a range of negative effects, including leaf burn, yellowing leaves, stunted growth, root damage, and increased susceptibility to pests and diseases. It can also disrupt the soil’s natural ecosystem.\n5. What are signs of over fertilizing? Signs of over-fertilizing include a crust of fertilizer on the soil surface, yellowing and wilting of lower leaves, browning leaf tips and margins, browned or blackened limp roots, defoliation, very slow or no growth, and death of seedlings.\n6. How do I fix my lawn after too much fertilizer? To fix a lawn that has been over-fertilized, start by watering deeply and frequently to leach out the excess fertilizer. If the damage is severe, you may need to overseed the affected areas or even replace the damaged turf.\n7. Is fish fertilizer fast-acting? Yes, fish fertilizer is considered a fast-acting fertilizer because plants can quickly absorb the nutrients. This means you’ll see results faster than with some other organic options, but it also means you may need to reapply it more frequently.\n8. Is fish fertilizer a complete fertilizer? While fish fertilizer contains essential nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium , it is not always considered a complete fertilizer. It may not contain all the micronutrients that plants need, so supplementing with other soil amendments is still crucial.\n9. How long does fish fertilizer last? Liquid fish fertilizers have a very long shelf-life until water is added.\n10. What plants like fish fertilizer? Many plants benefit from fish fertilizer , including tomatoes, vegetables, herbs, flowers, and indoor plants. It’s a versatile fertilizer that can be used in a variety of gardening applications.\n11. Is fish fertilizer good for tomatoes? Yes, fish emulsion can be used on tomato plants and will improve their overall health and fruit output.\n12. Can you use fish fertilizer during flowering? Yes, fish fertilizer is beneficial during the flowering stage, as it promotes bloom production and enhances flowering.\n13. Does fish fertilizer attract animals? The odor of fish fertilizer may attract some animals, particularly if it’s not diluted properly. However, some gardeners believe that the smell can also deter herbivores like deer and rabbits.\n14. Does fish fertilizer change soil pH? Fish emulsion is a natural way to raise soil pH.\n15. Is fish fertilizer high in nitrogen? Fish fertilizer is indeed high in nitrogen (N) , which promotes leafy growth and overall plant health. Most fish emulsion fertilizers have an NPK ratio around 4:1:1.\nBy understanding the potential risks of over-fertilization and following these guidelines, you can safely and effectively use fish fertilizer to promote healthy growth and abundant yields in your garden.

    "text": "VIENNA — After COVID-19 struck in 2020, creating chaos and misery, I hoped that some silver lining would emerge from this global tragedy. For a time, it seemed possible. The pandemic was a powerful reminder of our common vulnerabilities, our shared humanity, and the importance of solidarity that transcends our differences and borders. Now, however, I wonder if I was wrong even to hope. Once the pandemic subsided, we rushed back to the precipice with renewed vigor. None of the lessons of solidarity stuck, as if we were coated in Teflon. Many, if not all, of the pillars of the post-World War II global order seem to be crumbling. Violent conflict has become the default method to settle disagreements between countries (Russia and Ukraine) and within countries (Yemen and Sudan), while the multilateral security system, headed by the United Nations Security Council, is sliding into irrelevance.\nMoreover, the inequality gap between the Global North and the Global South has widened, and more of the latter countries are suffering from debilitating debt burdens. This, in turn, has exacerbated poverty, fuelled migration and sown distrust. With populism and authoritarianism on the rise, attacks on human rights and democratic values have intensified and, in some cases, the veneer of elections has given these attacks spurious legitimacy. And the intensifying rivalry between the United States and China is fast becoming an end in itself.\nBut the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel has dealt a particularly crushing blow to the system. The gross violations of international humanitarian law to protect civilians beggar belief. In fact, the atrocities committed against civilians, first in Israel and now in Gaza, are evil in its purest form. These despicable acts should be at the top of the priority list for the International Criminal Court prosecutor and addressed in International Court of Justice proceedings. We must halt this descent into the abyss.\nThe cavalier disregard for the principles and norms of international law, such as limitations on the right to self-defence, and the willful blocking of the Security Council from fulfilling its “primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security”, have been unconscionable.\nSenior UN humanitarian officials on the ground in Gaza have used phrases like “hell on earth” and “humanity giving up” to express their desperation. Few seem to be listening.\nThere is now a looming rupture between the West and the Arab and Muslim world, even as Western and Arab populations are directing anger toward their leaders. Dehumanising, rage-filled rhetoric emanates from all sides and reverberates on city streets, university campuses and in small towns the world over. All efforts to build bridges of respect and understanding over the last few decades seem to have collapsed.\nMoreover, the Arab and Muslim world has lost faith in perceived Western norms: international law and institutions, human rights and democratic values. In their view, the West itself is showing that brute force trumps all else. Of course, the increasing belief that democracy and human rights, the liberal values that once inspired the Arab Spring, are simply tools for Western domination is music to the ears of autocrats and despots.\nThe war underscores two lessons. First, conflicts do not resolve themselves, and allowing them to fester is shortsighted and dangerous. UN Secretary-General António Guterres was viciously attacked by Israel after saying that Hamas’s October 7 attack “did not happen in a vacuum”. But he was acknowledging a truth, the pent-up humiliation and sense of injustice among the Palestinians, that most people who follow the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have long recognised.\nThe conflict has elicited calls for the revival of the ill-fated “peace process” that has been limping along for decades. But the same leaders now promoting a two-state solution silently looked on as Israel devoured (through annexation and settlement expansion) most of the land that was meant for a Palestinian state. The aftermath of today’s violence may very well offer the last opportunity to reach a just and lasting peace before the entire region goes up in flames.\nThe other important lesson is that building a more robust and equitable global security system and financial architecture requires structural reforms. For starters, the veto power of the UN Security Council’s five permanent members should be drastically curtailed, if not eliminated. The US and Russia must also resume nuclear arms talks and take meaningful steps towards disarmament. It is scandalous that there is no longer a single nuclear-arms-control agreement in operation between the world’s two largest nuclear powers.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, must give the developing world a fair say in global decision-making and equitable access to financial resources for development. Although policymakers have been calling for such an overhaul since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago, no progress has been made.\nWe must not permit an opportunity born of war to slip through our fingers. In the absence of radical reform of the international order, the Gaza war will herald a world spiraling out of control.\nMohamed El Baradei, director general emeritus of the International Atomic Energy Agency, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005, jointly with the IAEA.
