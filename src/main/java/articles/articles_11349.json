    "text": "By Jesse Ferrell ,\n8 days ago On the heels of record rainfall and high winds, lake-effect snow and Arctic air are plunging into the East.\nA powerful storm that met the definition of a bomb cyclone on Thursday morning brought extreme wind and rain to the East Coast Wednesday night. The storm's pressure dipped the required 0.71 of an inch of mercury (24 millibars) in less than 24 hours between Wednesday and Thursday morning, AccuWeather meteorologists say.\nOver 100 wind damage reports and record rain Over a dozen states were hit by the massive storm, with over 100 reports of wind damage from North Carolina to Maine. Eastern Maine had the highest number of wind damage reports, and 90,000 customers were without power on Thursday morning, more than 1 in 10 customers in the state, according to PowerOutage.US . Aroostook County had more than half of its customers in the dark. Trenton and Bar Harbor both clocked wind gusts of 67 mph.\nAccuWeather's Bill Wadell reported live from the Hamptons on Long Island , which was just one of many areas dealing with flooding and high winds along the East coast. Where it didn't cause flooding, Waddell noted that the heavy rain was welcome in the Northeast where a severe drought and wildfires have recently ruled the weather news. In Budd Lake, New Jersey, however, a car hydroplaned, temporarily restricting lanes on Highway 46.\nAn atmospheric river flowing into the bomb cyclone brought heavy rainfall from Louisiana to Maine. Daily rainfall records were set in at least nine locations in the Northeast, including Avoca, Pennsylvania; Burlington, Vermont; Worcester, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; and Boston. The heaviest rain, over 5 inches, fell in Rhode Island. At 4.6 inches, the Providence record nearly doubled the previous record of 2.4 inches set on Dec. 11, 1992.\nBehind the storm: frigid air and feet of snow Behind the storm, heavy lake-effect snow piled up southeast of the favored Great Lakes snow belts, with 30 inches measured at Orchard Park, New York, just south of Buffalo. Other nearby towns reported 25-30 inches at noon Thursday. The snow will continue through Friday .\nFrigid air with the coldest air since last winter is filtering into the eastern U.S. Thursday . International Falls, Minnesota, began the day at 24 degrees below zero, while temperatures near zero approached Chicago and parts of Iowa. Some of that cold air will make it down to Florida with lows Thursday night expected to dip down into the 30s in the southwestern part of the state.\n10",

En effet, Courtrai s'est fait surprendre à Alost (84-83) tandis que Limburg trébuchait à Malines (76-65).\n[Belga](/journaliste/belga-5fd9b0a1d8ad5844d1b9592e/)Agence\n- Publié le 26-12-2024 à 23h34\n- à Bruxelles, Belgique\nDes contre-performances qui n'ont pas profité au Brussels puisque celui-ci a été battu à domicile (59-71) par le Spirou Charleroi. Enfin, Louvain s'est logiquement défait (74-57) de BAL Weert, la lanterne rouge du classement. Aux Pays-Bas, Leiden a battu Den Bosch 69-73 tandis que deux duels 100% néerlandais sont programmés vendredi.\nA Ostende, en dépit de l'absence de Tim Allen, les 2 et 3e quart-temps ont été fatals aux Giants (51-30 en 20 minutes) totalement balayés au rebond (44-17). En poursuite toute la rencontre, Courtrai a manqué de peu le hold-up au Forum alostois (25 points, 6 passes pour Niels Van Den Eynde). Même scénario pour Limburg United qui n'a pas mené une seconde au Winketkaai malinois. Bien que dominé au rebond (28-45), le Brussels a donné le change pendant près de 20 minutes (repos: 31-35) avant que le Spirou ne prenne définitivement l'ascendant. Enfin, Louvain n'a jamais été mis en péril par Weert.\n© 2024 Belga Newsbriefing. Tous droits de reproduction et de représentation réservés.

    "text": "Meteorologist Kristy Steward's First Warning Forecast Happy Friday morning! A coastal low pressure system will impact us Friday into Saturday and leave behind strong winds the rest of the weekend into next week. Clouds increase throughout the day Friday and winds begin to pick up. Easterly winds of 10-20 MPH. High temperatures will be a few degrees warmer in the upper 50s. Friday evening, scattered rain showers begin moving in after 6 PM from the south to the north. Rain showers become more widespread and heavier throughout the night and Saturday morning. Saturday will be a very wet and windy day, but also warmer. Highs in the mid to upper 60s. Southerly winds of 20-30 MPH with gusts up to 40 MPH. It will be a soggy morning with widespread rain and embedded thunderstorms. Late morning, we could catch a quick dry break before a final line of storms early afternoon. We’ll dry out in the evening. Expecting 1.5”-2” rainfall with this system, locally higher amounts around 3”. The Outer Banks/Dare County is under a level 1 of 5 risk for severe storms Saturday. Damaging wind gusts and heavy downpours leading to flooding are the primary concerns. Sunday will be drier with lots of sunshine, but still very windy. Northerly winds of 20-30 MPH gusting to 45 MPH. With these strong northerly winds, expect tidal flooding. Temperatures will be cooler with highs back down to the low to mid 50s. A rough surf and ocean overwash is also possible this weekend 6-8’ waves in the Atlantic Saturday. 8-10’ waves Sunday. The workweek starts off dry with plenty of sunshine. Winds remain gusty. Northeasterly winds of 10-20 MPH gusting to 30 MPH Monday and Tuesday. Highs in the mid to upper 50s. Wednesday warms into the seasonable low 60s, but a cold front on the way brings more clouds and a rain chance later in the day Wednesday lasting into Thursday. Winds pick up around and behind the cold front. Pollen Update: Juniper, Elm, and Poplar are the main allergens. Friday - high Saturday - low Sunday - high Monday - very high The rain gives us a pollen break Saturday, but winds bring it all back Sunday and beyond. Connect with Meteorologist Kristy Steward:",

    "title": "Determined to run in re-election, will defeat Trump: US President Biden",
    "text": "A defiant US President Joe Biden has insisted that he is “determined” and fit to seek re-election and defeat his Republican rival Donald Trump in November, even as two excruciating gaffes marred his efforts to dismiss concerns over his age and fitness. During a high-stakes solo news conference on Thursday at the conclusion of the NATO Summit here, Biden said that no poll or person is telling him that he can't win reelection currently. That is the only way he would consider ending his presidential bid. “I'm determined to run,” 81-year-old Biden, the oldest sitting US President, said. “The fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him (Trump) once, and I will beat him again. Secondly.. The idea that senators and congressmen are running for office worrying about the ticket is not unusual and I might add, there were at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in a campaign,” Biden said. “So there's a long way to go in this campaign, and so I'm just going to keep moving, keep moving,” he said. Toward the beginning of the question-and-answer session, Biden mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as former President Trump amid mounting questions surrounding his mental acuity. He said Harris was qualified to be president as well, although he misnamed her in the endorsement. “I wouldn't have picked vice-president Trump to be vice-president if she's not qualified to be president,” Biden said. He made a similar mistake earlier in the day, accidentally calling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky “President Putin” while introducing him during a NATO event. He continued to defy the pleas from a growing number of Democrats to step down from the Democratic ticket. Asked if he was determined to stay in the race despite the fears of some Democratic lawmakers, Biden said, “I'm determined on running, but I think it's important that I realise allay fears by seeing - let them see me out there. Let them see me out.” He said his campaign was strong and working hard in “toss-up states.” \"..Look, I got more work to do. We've got more work to finish. We made so much progress. Think about where we are economically relative to the rest of the world. Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy. We created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs, …so things are moving. We've got more to go,” the president said. “Working-class people still need help. Corporate greed is still at large. Corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic. They're coming down and so I'm optimistic about where things are going,” he asserted. Biden added that he is seeking his re-election not for his legacy. “I'm in this to complete the job I started. As you recall, understandably, many of you and many economists thought my initial initiatives that I put forward can't do that because it's going to cause inflation. Things are going to skyrocket. The debt's going to go up. What are you hearing now from mainstream economists?” “Sixteen economic Nobel laureates said I've done a hell of a job, that under my plan so far and what's going to happen in the future if I'm reelected, that things are going to get much better. Our economy is growing. I was determined when I got elected to stop the trickle-down economic theory that if the wealthy did very well, everybody else would do well,” the president said. Biden refuted reports that he told his aides that he needed to go to bed earlier and end meetings around eight in the evening. “That's not true… what I said was, instead of my every day starting at seven and going to bed at midnight, it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more. And I said, for example, the 8:00, 7:00, 6:00 stuff, instead of starting the fundraiser at 9:00, start at 8:00. People get to go home by 10:00. That's what I'm talking about,” he said. When asked about what changed his mind when in 2020 he said that he would be the bridge candidacy for a younger, fresher generation of Democratic leaders, Biden said: “What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy and domestic division.” Biden also offered extensive remarks on thorny foreign policy issues, including competition with China and the Israel-Hamas war. He said he had warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from an occupation of the Gaza Strip. He said he was directly in contact with Chinese President Xi Jinping to warn him not to offer further support for Russia's war in Ukraine, but not with Vladimir Putin, whom he said: “I have no reason to speak to him right now.” Biden said he was totally opposed to the occupation and trying to unite Afghanistan. He said that the US should have left the country after killing Osama bin Laden. “There's no need to occupy anywhere. Go after the people who did the job. You may recall I still get criticized for it, but I was totally opposed to the occupation and trying to unite Afghanistan,” he told reporters at a news conference. “Once we got bin Laden, we should have moved on because it was not in our -- and no one's ever going to unite that country,” he said. “I've been over every inch of that -- not every inch, the entirety from the poppy fields all the way to the north. I said don't make the same mistake we made. Don't think that's what you should be doing is doubling down,” he said. Meanwhile, three House Democrats -- Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, Scott Peters of California and Eric Sorensen of Illinois -- on Thursday joined others to call on President Biden to step aside from the 2024 race following the news conference. Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, argued that Biden should make the decision to suspend his campaign to not risk his legacy. Trump, who is seeking his second term, also mocked Biden. “Crooked Joe begins his ‘Big Boy' Press Conference with, ‘I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president, though I think she was not qualified to be president,” Trump, 78, posted on his social media platform Truth Social.",

    "text": "Thanksgiving weekend is upon us and that means turkey dinners and fall yard cleanups. After a few weeks of mostly cool and wet weather, the long weekend forecast for Prince George promises temperatures well above normal for this time of year with only a small chance of rain – at least for Saturday and most of Sunday. But Monday is expected to be rainy, so if you have outdoor activities on your agenda you’d best get to that early in the weekend. We’re heading for a high today of 11 C and an overnight low of -2 C, but Saturday is looking spectacular, with a sunny high of 16 C – six degrees above average. Clouds are expected to move in Saturday night and that will keep the overnight temperatures from dropping below 7 C. Expect cloudy skies on Sunday with a high of 16 C and a low of 6 C, with a 30 per cent chance of showers at night. Clouds will continue to build on Thanksgiving Monday and the chance of rain will increase to 60 per cent with a forecast high of 10 C, dropping to -1 C overnight. The start of the work week on Tuesday will bring a mix of sun and cloud with the high reaching 11 C. More wet weather in store for Wednesday and a predicted high of 8 C.",

    "text": "BY KYLE TROUTMAN ktroutman@cassville-democrat.com Patricia Busch, of Wheaton, always walks with God, but she was happy on July 15 to walk with someone in her life who saved it.\nBusch, 75, utilizes Integrity Home Care and Hospice’s services, welcoming Julie Phillips, APC (advanced personal care), of Monett into her home three times a week. Last Tuesday, Phillips was able to intervene in a situation that could have turned fatal.\n“I was eating a chicken wrap with apple in it,” Busch said. “The apple pieces were not that big, but I didn’t get one chewed up well, and I started choking. Julie came over to my chair, grabbed my arm and lifted me up. I was wheezing and could not breathe, and she did the Heimlich maneuver and a tiny piece of apple came flying out.\n“It was lodged in my windpipe, and if Julie wasn’t here, I don’t know what would have happened.”\nBusch shouldered some of the blame for the incident, saying she should have been sitting up straighter when eating, and Phillips said after the Heimlich maneuver worked, she apologized for not cutting up the apple a bit smaller.\n“I saw Patricia was holding her throat and hitting her chest, and she couldn’t breathe or talk and was leaning back in her chair not able to get up,” Phillips said. “I helped her up and got her some water to try to help it go down, but that did not work, so that’s when I did the Heimlich. Being trained on it, I was just like, ‘I have to do this.’” Phillips said it was the first time she’d used the maneuver on another person while they were actively choking, but the intensity of the situation did not fluster her.\n“It just happened,” she said. “Instincts took over. We tried everything before doing the Heimlich, and the best thing to do in those situations is to try not to panic.”\nPhillips has been an in-home care provider for five years, getting into the industry by chance after completing dental assistant school.\n“I started applying for jobs, and this was the first one that called,” she said. “CPR training is required, as well as other life-saving measures training like the Heimlich maneuver. But, I’ve always had this training anyways.”\nThis was not Busch’s first near-fatal experience, as she said another caregiver saved her life in Idaho many years ago after she had gone into a diabetic coma. Busch said she was grateful to Phillips for taking action, and grateful to God she was there to be able to help.\n“There are no words to describe how much I appreciate Julie,” Busch said. “I’ve been in situations where people just watch or freeze up, even if they are trained. I’m thankful she could do it, and that it was successful.\n“I’m so mighty thankful if I had $1 million, I would give it to her.”\n“And I wouldn’t have taken it,” Phillips said.\nPublisher’s Note: For more on this story, visit: https://www.cassville-democrat.com/2025/07/23/good-news-in-wheaton/",
