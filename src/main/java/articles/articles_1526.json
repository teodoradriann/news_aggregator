    "text": "Another day of temperatures that are a good deal above average, despite some cooling compared to yesterday. Highs in a near-50 to mid-50s zone compare to averages in the mid-40s. If you are a fan of the mild side of seasonable, the weather ahead is for you. The pattern is a bit stagnant through the holiday weekend, though, which means there’s not a whole lot of change in day-to-day weather. Listen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options Through Tonight: Other than a quick sprinkle possible this evening, nothing much to think about out there overnight. Skies trend partly to mainly clear after midnight. Lows are mostly around freezing to the mid-30s. View the current weather at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Saturday): Partly cloudy and pretty decent for late December. Breezy conditions are probably the main negative. Upper 40s to around 50 most spots for afternoon maximums. West winds around 10 mph gust near 20 mph. Sunday: Mostly sunny skies are a good bet much of the day. Like Saturday, mainly upper 40s to near 50 for highs. Temperatures are likely about mid-30s to near 40 for the ball drop at midnight. Monday (New Year’s Day): Partly sunny, which might be mostly sunny in the morning and mostly cloudy later on. Probably a touch cooler, with highs mainly in the mid- and upper 40s. A quick flurry or shower is possible. Winds should blow from the south and southwest.

Among the many warm records in recent days, Washington snagged a new one for the warm low on Thursday. It only got down to 51, which beat the old record of 50 on the date in 2008.

    "title": "Gasoline forecast: Lower overall prices in 2024 | News | oleantimesherald.com",
    "text": "> GasBuddy on Thursday released its annual fuel price outlook with some good news for drivers: expect lower gasoline and diesel prices in 2024.\nThe outlook highlights key trends in gasoline and diesel prices, forecasting that, after two years of above-average gas prices, 2024 will bring relief at the pump for consumers as several factors contribute to less of a pinch at the pump. GasBuddy expects the yearly national average will drop from $3.51 per gallon this year to $3.38 in 2024.\nHighlights from GasBuddy’s 2024 outlook:\n• Gas prices still could fall below a national average of $3 per gallon this winter before starting to rise in late-February, getting close to $4 per gallon as summer approaches, then mildly declining into summer, with hurricane season presenting uncertainty in late summer.\n• Drivers in some California cities could again briefly see prices above $6/gallon if major refinery issues develop during the summer, although most major U.S. cities will see prices peak at or slightly below $4 per gallon in 2024.\n• Americans are expected to spend a combined $446.9 billion on gasoline in 2024. Average yearly spending per household will fall to an estimated $2,407, down 2% from 2023, and over 12% less compared to 2022.\n• Electric vehicles (EVs) and the 2024 presidential election have the potential to impact fuel prices in the year ahead, with a potential slowdown in the EV transition at stake.\n• Memorial Day will be the priciest 2024 holiday at the pump, with the national average price of gasoline expected to be $3.56-$4.04 per gallon on the holiday.\n“As 2023 fades away, I’m hopeful those $5 and $6 prices for gasoline and diesel will also fade into memory,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. “The global refining picture continues to improve, providing more capacity and peace of mind that record-setting prices will stay away from the pump in 2024.”\nDe Haan anticipates there will still be some volatility, unexpected outages and disruptions, and potentially weather-related issues, but he does not expect it to lead to record prices.\n“Offsetting OPEC+’s production cuts is contributing to the rise of U.S. oil production, which now stands at record levels,” he said. “Combined with Canada, North American oil production could further stabilize countries that have decided to curb oil production.”\nMore uncertainty is expected with hurricane season in late summer. Diesel prices are also predicted to fall incrementally from 2023, peaking at $4.13 per gallon in March 2024.\nEarlier this week, GasBuddy reported average gasoline prices in New York fell 5.5 cents per gallon from the previous week, averaging $3.33/g Monday.\nPrices in New York were 19.9 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stood 3.6 cents per gallon lower than a year ago.\nThe national average price of diesel rose 0.6 cents in the last week and stood at $4.00 per gallon.\nIn Olean, the average price for 87 octane dropped from the previous week’s $3.699/g to $3.599/g, which was posted as of Thursday. In Bradford, Pa., the price was the same this week.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, lowest price in the state to begin the week was $2.49/g while the highest was $4.39/g, a difference of $1.90/g.\nThe national average price of gasoline rose 2.9 cents per gallon from last week, averaging $3.07/g to begin the week. The national average was down 13.8 cents per gallon from a month ago and stood at 1.8 cents per gallon higher than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data.\nSome other New York regions and gas prices earlier this week included Buffalo at $3.52/g, down 3 cents; Syracuse at $3.34/g, down 1.8 cents; and Rochester at $3.41/g, down 3.8 cents per gallon from last week’s $3.44/g.\nAAA Western and Central New York reported demand for gasoline has been strong amid the 10-day holiday travel period, when AAA predicted nearly 104 million motorists would drive 50 miles or more from their home.\nIn addition, oil prices are creeping higher back toward the $80 a barrel mark. If these trends continue, motorists could see gas prices rise.",

    "text": "Government officials issued a geomagnetic storm watch for the first time since 2005, as five earth-directed coronal mass ejections were detected on the sun.\nThe first of the solar flares is expected to begin hitting Earth's magnetic field on Friday. Activity could linger into Sunday as subsequent CMEs reach the planet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center said that aurora may be visible overnight Friday into Saturday as far south as Alabama.\nThe Space Weather Prediction Center is forecasting that nearly all of Canada and the U.S.-Canadian border will be able to view an aurora, pending clear skies.\nMany northern U.S. states also will have a chance to see the aurora.\n\"Several strong flares have been observed over the past few days and were associated with a large and magnetically complex sunspot cluster (NOAA region 3664), which is 16 times the diameter of Earth. Additional solar activity is expected from the region,\" the Space Weather Prediction Center said.\nSpace\nAurora Borealis 'Unreal,' NASA Astronaut Says (VIDEO) Scripps News Staff 1:01 PM, Mar 01, 2023 The agency said that a severe geomagnetic storm can cause issues on the ground. Severe geomagnetic storms can cause electric grids to have \"possible widespread voltage control problems, and some protective systems will mistakenly trip out key assets from the grid.\" The agency says spacecraft \"may experience surface charging and tracking problems, corrections may be needed for orientation problems.\"\nThe storm may also cause disruptions to UHF/VHF communication frequencies and may temporarily interfere with GPS and other satellite communication.\nNASA announced Friday the storm posed no threat to astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The orbiting station is still far enough within Earth's magnetic field to receive some protection from high-energy flares, and the space agency said this storm is not intense enough to warrant extra precautions for the crew.\nOn the ground, officials said they have notified the operators of large power systems that are at risk so they can take protective action. Experts at the Space Weather Prediction Center say the storm is not likely to otherwise affect people's day-to-day life.\nThe last time Earth weathered a geomagnetic storm of this intensity was in October of 2003. The storm caused power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformer infrastructure in South Africa.",

    "text": "Electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties in Scotland without power after [Storm Gerrit](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-scots-homes-still-without-31765400) will be reconnected on Friday. Graeme Keddie, the director of corporate affairs at SSEN, said “hard work” by its staff has reconnected more than 45,000 properties who had lost power as a result of the latest storm to hit the UK. High winds, heavy rain and [snow](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scotland-could-see-20cm-snow-31759780?int_source=nba) damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country, but Mr Keddie said that by Friday morning there were 750 homes remaining without electricity, describing that as a “much improved picture”. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, he told how SSEN staff had “made a tremendous effort in restoring power to customers affected by Storm Gerrit, battling some very tough weather conditions”. He said: “We have now restored power to over 45,000 homes and there are now 750 homes still to be connected. “And we’re confident through the resource levels we have we can reconnect these customers throughout today.” He thanked those affected for their “ongoing patience” as the power firm makes its “final push” to restore electricity. Storm Gerrit resulted in a “lot of localised faults” to the power network, Mr Geddie said, adding there were a “lot of points of multiple damage”. This he said was “down to the ferocity of Storm Gerrit”, adding that wind speeds had been up to 10mph higher than had been forecast in some areas. Join the Daily Record WhatsApp community!

    "text": "Dec. 28—Tras declarar la anunciada visita de un buque de guerra británico a Guyana como “una amenaza intolerable”, el gobernante venezolano, Nicolás Maduro, lanzó el jueves un ejercicio militar improvisado en aguas cercanas a su vecino con el objetivo de mostrar el poderío militar de su régimen en medio de la disputa fronteriza entre los dos países.\nLas autoridades del régimen brindaron pocos detalles sobre el alcance y la duración del ejercicio, pero militares venezolanos dijeron que en una fase inicial incluía la participación de alrededor de una docena de naves de guerra y el doble en aeronaves, incluyendo aviones de combate.\nLos ejercicios están siendo realizados en el Golfo de Paria, al oeste de Trinidad y frente al Delta del Orinoco, al oeste de Guyana.\nEl operativo militar, anunciado el jueves a través de la televisión estatal, fue organizado en respuesta a informes publicados días antes por la BBC de que Gran Bretaña enviaría al HMS Trent a Guyana esta semana para que participe en ejercicios conjuntos con naciones del Caribe. El patrullero tiene normalmente su base en Gibraltar y es utilizado principalmente para combatir la piratería y el tráfico de drogas.\nEse anuncio sorprendió al régimen de Caracas, produciéndose a menos de dos semanas que Venezuela y Guyana se comprometieran a enfriar la animosidad entre los dos países, que había resurgido después de que Maduro celebrara un referéndum a principios de este mes pidiendo a los venezolanos poderes especiales para tomar por la fuerza aproximadamente tres cuartas partes del territorio que actualmente ocupa su vecino.\nRodeado por militares, Maduro dijo el jueves en cadena nacional que la visita del buque de guerra británico era intolerable.\n“Venezuela no se puede quedar de brazos cruzados frente a una amenaza, estamos respondiendo en la medida proporcional”, dijo el gobernante al anunciar el operativo.\n“He ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB) sobre el Caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensivo como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país”, agregó.\nUn funcionario del Departamento de Estado le dijo a McClatchy que el gobierno de Estados Unidos estaba al tanto de los anuncios hechos en Caracas sobre los ejercicios militares en Venezuela y dijo que la administración sigue insistiendo en el alcance de una resolución pacífica a la disputa.\n“Damos la bienvenida al acuerdo del 14 de diciembre entre el presidente de Guyana, Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali, y Nicolás Maduro en San Vicente y las Granadinas para no amenazarse ni usar la fuerza entre sí en ninguna circunstancia y abstenerse de escalar cualquier conflicto o desacuerdo”, dijo el funcionario.\n“Seguimos pidiendo una resolución pacífica de la disputa y que se respete el laudo arbitral de 1899 que determinó el límite terrestre entre Venezuela y Guyana hasta que las partes lleguen a un nuevo acuerdo o un órgano legal competente decida lo contrario”, añadió.\nLa embajada británica en Washington no respondió de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios. Previamente, un portavoz del Ministerio de Defensa británico le había confirmado la visita del buque de guerra, diciendo que “el HMS Trent visitará a Guyana, aliado regional y socio de la Commonwealth, a finales de este mes como parte de una serie de compromisos en la región durante su despliegue de la Tarea de Patrulla Atlántica”.\nEl Trent hizo escala en Bridgetown, Barbados, después de zarpar de su puerto base en Gibraltar a principios de este mes y estaba programado que se dirigiera hacia Guyana esta semana para anclar frente a Georgetown.\nNo estaba claro dónde se encontraba el navío al momento que Maduro hizo su anuncio.\nArmado con un cañón de 30 mm, dos miniguns y varias ametralladoras, el HMS Trent, de 297 pies de largo, es utilizado principalmente en operaciones contra la piratería y el contrabando. Normalmente lleva un helicóptero y un destacamento de marines.\nEn un intento por reducir las tensiones entre los dos países, los líderes de Guyana y Venezuela se reunieron hace dos semanas en San Vicente y las Granadinas y se comprometieron a no usar la fuerza para resolver la disputa sobre qué nación es la dueña legítima de una región rica en petróleo y minerales que limita con el dos países, aproximadamente del tamaño de Florida.\nLa disputa fronteriza, que se prolonga desde principios del siglo XIX, cobró intensidad tras un referéndum celebrado el 3 de diciembre, en el que el régimen socialista de Caracas pidió a los venezolanos dar luz verde al uso de la fuerza para anexar tres cuartas partes del territorio de Guyana.\nEl gobierno de Maduro dijo que el 95% de los venezolanos votaron a favor de la anexión forzosa, pero observadores independientes cuestionaron los resultados diciendo que las estaciones electorales vacías que se vieron durante la votación no respaldan las afirmaciones de que participaron más de 10 millones de personas.\n(c)2023 El Nuevo Herald (Miami) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",
