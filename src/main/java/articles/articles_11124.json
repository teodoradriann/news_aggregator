    "text": "La victoria frente al Southampton resulta de suma importancia para sus aspiraciones en la máxima categoría del fútbol inglés.\nPor Canal26\nJueves 16 de Enero de 2025 - 18:59\nLuego de vencer al Arsenal por penales y avanzar en la FA Cup, el Manchester United volvió a disputar un compromiso por la Premier League con la intención de seguir por la senda ganadora. Aprovechando que se enfrentaba al Southampton, último en la tabla, consiguió los tres puntos en Old Trafford.\nCon una actuación increíble de Amad Diallo, autor de los tres goles de su equipo, los Red Devils remontaron un partido que parecía complicado frente a un rival que apenas había sumado seis unidades en 20 partidos.\nCuando estaba por finalizar el primer tiempo, a los 43 minutos, Manuel Ugarte tuvo la mala fortuna de que un cabezazo se desviara en su espalda y terminara inflando la red. De esta forma, el Southampton se ponía por delante en el marcador y los hinchas se impacientaban en las tribunas.\nEl gol de Amad Diallo, en un momento crítico del equipo, empató el encuentro a los 80'. El oriundo de Costa de Marfil protagonizó una jugada individual que culminó con una buena definición.\nTan solo 9 minutos después, el joven de 22 años puso a los dirigidos por Ruben Amorim al frente del marcador tras una gran jugada y una previa asistencia de Christian Eriksen.\nPara culminar su obra maestra, el marfileño aprovechó un error en la salida del Southampton y, así, armó el primer hattrick de su carrera.\nCon esta victoria, el Manchester United queda a 10 puntos del Ipswich Town, el conjunto que se ubica 18° y está virtualmente descendido.\nTe puede interesar:\nPremier League: el Arsenal le ganó el clásico de Londres al Tottenham y quedó a 4 puntos del Liverpool\n1\nEn medio de los rumores de su regreso a Boca, Paredes habló sobre su futuro: \"Tengo muchas ganas\"\n2\nRiver Plate vs. Selección de México: cómo comprar las entradas para el partido amistoso en el Monumental\n3\nUna experiencia visual única para los hinchas: River presentó su innovadora pantalla LED 360°\n4\nFórmula 1: se filtraron imágenes del monoplaza usará Franco Colapinto en Alpine durante 2025\n5\nJuanfer Quintero se despidió de Racing con un emotivo mensaje: \"Seré un embajador de su grandeza\"",
