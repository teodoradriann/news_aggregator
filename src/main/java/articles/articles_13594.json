    "text": "Report warns gender ideology is risking the fairness and safety of competitions\nGoverning bodies should have their funding cut if they fail to protect female sports amid concern about trans- gender players, a leading think-tank says.\nA report by the Policy Exchange warns that gender ideology is risking the fairness and safety of competitions for women and girls.\nThe analysis, which is backed by athletes including Martina Navratilova, Sharron Davies and Daley Thompson, highlights the major physical advantages which biological males have over females.\nThe winning woman at this year’s London Marathon would have been beaten by the 231st ranked male, it found.\nAnd every British ‘long course’ swimming record set by an elite female swimmer has been beaten by a teenage boy. In addition, at least three female records set at 5k community Parkrun events are held by biological males.\nMartina Navratilova of the USA takes part in the Legends All Access Hour at the Australian Open tennis tournament at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, in 2020\nSharron Davies at the Beauty Awards in London, in 2019\nThe report highlighted concerns about ‘gender self-ID’, saying it ‘fundamentally compromises fair and safe competition for women and girls within grassroots, amateur and elite sport’.\nPolicy Exchange is now calling on sport governing bodies, the UK Government and the International Olympic Committee to restrict categories for women and girls to biological females at all levels of sport.\nSome 99.99 per cent of those taking part in sport and physical activity are not elite or professional, the report points out, meaning that grassroots competitions for females are ‘much more likely’ to be affected by the issue.\nIn county athletics championships, the winning male from the slowest county in the 1,500m race in 2023 would have beaten the winning female in 27 out of 33 counties, the think-tank said.\nIt recommends that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should require all national governing bodies to update their policies within 12 months to ensure that there is a protected female single-sex category – and that they should lose taxpayer funding if they fail to do so.\nPolicy Exchange also says that Parkrun should be ordered to collect participant data based on biological sex and not gender identity, and update all relevant course records to reflect this within 12 months or lose tax- payer funding.\nFormer Olympic swimmer Ms Davies said: ‘There is a sense within sports policy that while we should protect the female category within elite sports, women and girls participating and competing at amateur levels should budge over.\nFormer British decathlete Daley Thompson at the Laureus World Sports Awards ceremony at the Verti Music Hall in Berlin, Germany, in 2020\n‘They must ‘be kind’ and ‘inclusive’ while having to pretend it is not grossly unfair, demotivating and possibly unsafe to accommodate biological males within their races, teams and sports days.\n‘Every sport, at every level, from grassroots to elite, must ensure that the female category is ringfenced for biological females.’\nMs Navratilova, the former world No 1 female tennis player and an 18-time grand slam champion, said: ‘Female sport must be protected otherwise we risk not only alienating a generation of women, but also taking away dreams and possibilities of fairness and winning for girls and women.’\nDaley Thompson, two-time Olympic gold medallist in the decathlon, said: ‘We risk alienating a generation of young female athletes if we cannot promise them fair and safe play from the grassroots level to the top.\n‘Categories exist to allow everyone the chance to participate, and the willingness to compromise this by policymakers within sport is a scandal.’\nA spokesman for Sport England, which is responsible for developing grassroots sport, said: ‘In 2021, the Sports Council Equality Group published Transgender Inclusion in Domestic Sport Guidance. While it is up to sports to set their own rules, we work closely with all organisations we fund to ensure they meet all the agreed criteria and code for sports governance.\n‘In this challenging and emotive area of policy, we understand and accept that there are a wide range of personal views, and we urge respectful discourse on this matter, and that sports consider their duty of care to all athletes.’",

O foco é inibir a ocorrência de tragédias socioambientais no estado.\nO programa “Mapeia Minas” será usado para monitorar barragens,\nenchentes, secas e demais eventos climáticos, além de ter um sistema integrado da localização de famílias no CadÚnico em situação de vulnerabilidade ou que residem em áreas de risco.\nAté o momento, não há previsão de quando o sistema será colocado em prática ou liberado para acesso público. O Metrópoles entrou em contato com a Sedese, mas não obteve respostas. O espaço segue aberto.\nNos últimos quatro anos, Minas Gerais vem sofrendo com problemas relacionados à\nchuva. Entre 2021 e 2022, o estado registrou elevados volumes de precipitações e metade dos 853 municípios chegaram a entrar em situação de emergência ou calamidade. À época, cerca de 70 mil ficaram desabrigados ou desalojados.\nDe acordo com\nlevantamento da Coordenadoria Estadual de Defesa Civil (Cedec), no período chuvoso de 2023/2024 (entre 27/9 do ano passado e 31/3 deste ano) 2.833 pessoas foram desalojadas, 399 ficaram desabrigadas e seis vítimas morreram em decorrência das chuvas em MG.\nEnquanto no período anterior (2022/2023), foram registrados 12.923 desalojados, 2.241 desabrigados, além de 22 mortes devido à chuva.\nMapeia Minas\nTudo começou quando a Sedese teve a ideia de construir uma rede de sistema que gerasse informações sobre as áreas de risco que existem em Minas Gerais, com informações da localização de famílias vulneráveis para implementar ações de prevenção a eventos climáticos extremos.\nA plataforma do Mapa Minas usa dados de geolocalização que foram integrados a uma amostra da base de dados do Cadastro Único para Programas Sociais (\nCadÚnico), bem como os alertas climáticos do Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia ( Inmet).\nCom as informações, a Sedese pode fazer o georreferenciamento de pessoas e controlar os dados por meio de painéis, com o mapa apontando quando há alertas meteorológicos.\nO Mapeia Minas possibilita fazer a busca por município e a verificação da quantidade e o local onde estão as pessoas em situação de risco, de acordo com as previsões meteorológicas, visando uma ação preventiva.\nA iniciativa é de autoria da SoftwareOne, AWS e governo de Minas Gerais. Também participaram do desenvolvimento do sistema o Ministério Público, Corpo de Bombeiros, Defesa Civil de MG e entidades que atuam em casos de desastres ambientais.",
