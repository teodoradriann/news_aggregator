Sorvegliata la frana di Laveno Mombello\nPiovaschi, addensamenti, nubi alte: si va verso il miglioramento del tempo, verso il sole che tornerà dopo diversi giorni di pioggia battente che hanno investito il Varesotto e in generale la Lombardia causando danni e problemi in diverse zone della Regione (foto: Daniela Decorato per\nOggi nel Varesotto).\nVARESE\nIn provincia si sono contati diversi smottamenti, in particolare sorvegliato da vicino anche con geologi, il problema\nlungo la via Vararo a Laveno Mombello che ha causato l’evacuazione di una famiglia dalla casa di residenza e la chiusura della strada. Nella notte sono proseguiti diversi interventi per allagamenti e tagli pianta. In particolare i vigili del fuoco del comando di via Legnani sono intervenuti dopo l’alba di lunedì in via Ariosto per una grande pianta caduta e che crea problemi alla viabilità.\nLOMBARDIA\nSono stati infatti quasi 400 gli interventi dei vigili del fuoco in tutta la Lombardia: a Milano è entrata in azione la vasca di laminazione del Seveso, e il Lambro ha dato problemi in Brianza, mentre a Brescia un ponteggio è caduto sul Foro Romano. Danni anche nel Pavese e in provincia di Lecco e tantissima neve in Valtellina. Danni nel Mantovano per vento forte, con tetti lesionati e scoperchiati.\nMETEO\nPer il\nCentro geofisico prealpino “Ancora variabile oggi con la perturbazione responsabile delle piogge dei giorni scorsi che si allontana verso SE. Da domani graduale aumento della pressione atmosferica con tempo stabile e giornate soleggiate. Le temperature massime si alzano e il clima sarà mite.“\nLunedì Al mattino nuvoloso con rari e locali piovaschi in area pedemontana e nevischio sopra i 1300m. Nel pomeriggio soleggiato e asciutto.

    "text": "Crisp weekend continues, but more 70s to come – Chris\nGood Saturday evening to one and all!\nIt’s been a true taste of fall today with clouds, isolated showers and sprinkles for a select few, and cooler highs in the lower 60s and upper 50s. As we approach sunset, clouds are clearing, if they haven’t for you already, with a bit of sunshine in store before the day is finally over. Sunday will be even cooler and breezy. A mix of sun and clouds will fill the sky as highs stay in the 50s. Once again, a few showers can’t be ruled out as a strong north to northwesterly breeze blows at 15 to 20 mph.\nLooking ahead to early next week, FROST still looks to make an appearance. Monday will start out in the upper 30s in the metro, with lower 30s out state. Highs will struggle out of the 40s and into the lower 50s under partly cloudy skies. As winds relax a skies clear, the stage will be set for the end of the growing season Monday night into Tuesday. This is when overnight lows could fall to near, or even below, the freezing point.\nFall is definitely fighting its way in, but not without some battle. Southwesterly winds return by Wednesday which will begin to boost temperatures. It’ll be a sunny day and highs will climb back into the 60s. As the southwest flow becomes more pronounced, temperatures respond accordingly. Thursday will be mostly sunny with highs returning to the lower and middle 70s. Friday will really see a temperature boost as winds pick up ahead of a cold front. Clouds will increase as highs reach the upper 70s… dare I say a low 80?\nDepending on timing of the cold front and moisture placement, this could set us up for a round of somewhat meaningful rainfall by next weekend. As always, let Minnesota’s Weather Authority do the worrying between then and now. We’ll keep you updated daily on how things are shaping up.\nEnjoy the rest of the weekend!\n– Meteorologist Chris Reece",

    "text": "Turning silver to gold, Tim Hodge’s golden moment arrived on Night 8 of the Paris Paralympic Games, delivering a dominant performance to win the men’s SM9 200m individual medley.\nAfter taking silver in Tokyo, Hodge immediately turned his sights to winning gold in Paris in his pet event. Not only did he achieve this dream, but he also went one stroke further, claiming top spot in a new Paralympic record of 2:13.31.\nSetting a blistering pace, Hodge led from the outset finishing 2.67 seconds ahead of hometown hero, France’s Ugo Didier.\nAdding to the gold medal he claimed earlier in the week in the Mixed 4x100m Medley Relay (34 points), Hodge admitted he had to refocus to get himself ready for his main event.\n“After the relay earlier in the meet, I knew I had to bring myself back down, bring myself back into the right headspace to race tonight and I was able to do that,” he said.\n“I’m really happy with that result and now it’s time to have a little bit of a celebration with the gold medal…then once the meet is over, my coach and I can really let the feeling sink in.\n“Going into the race, I knew a lot of the guys would go fairly easy in the heats so going into the finals they’d be going a lot harder.\n“I was confident in myself and my race plans that I would be able to execute and get the race I wanted and hopefully the time I wanted as well, so quite happy with how it worked out.”\nAfter not getting the desired outcome he had hoped for earlier in the week in the men’s S9 400m freestyle, Hodge said he put that race out of his mind and focused on the task at hand.\n“The key thing with good athletes is they can keep getting themselves up race after race no matter the result and keep swimming their best.\n“I’ve had issues like that in the past where I haven’t had the best first race…but I’ve been able to back up and go on to do PBs, even after a bad race,” he said.\nIn the women’s SM9 200m individual medley, Lakeisha Patterson wasn’t able to add to her silver medal from earlier in the week, having to settle for fifth place in a time of 2:39.99.\nJenna Jones wrapped up her Paralympic Games with a PB and Oceania Record in the women’s SB12 100m breaststroke where she finished sixth, clocking 1:22.04.\nBy: Jodie Hawkins, Paralympics Australia\nPublished: 5 September 2024",

    "text": "Study: Biased language in handoffs may negatively affect care\nWhen clinicians [hear](https://www.newswise.com/articles/biased-language-in-clinical-handoffs-may-negatively-impact-patient-care) patients described with negatively biased language, they are less likely to recall critical health details, which can influence the care received, a [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828116) found. Published in JAMA Network Open, the study consisted of a survey-based experiment in which each clinician heard short, recorded handoffs. The researchers created two versions for each handoff scenario: a neutral one stating the patient’s situation and needs, and a biased one expressing a negative stereotype, blame or doubt about the patient’s credibility. After listening to each handoff, participants answered a question testing their recall of key details. The authors say standardizing handoffs ─ permitting only neutral, medically relevant facts ─ are needed to prevent bias. Such a policy could benefit Black patients, who disproportionately experience medical errors.

    "title": "Escala el conflicto por los colectivos y Jorge teme que se los traspasen por decreto",
    "text": "Tal cual. Ni el gobierno nacional liberal libertario ni el de la ciudad (encabezado por exitosos empresarios como Jorge Macri, un hombre que hizo su fortuna por su cuenta) piensan en las verdaderas víctimas de este aumento de tarifas: los pobres empresarios, que día tras día generan riqueza en la ciudad con sus colectivos a pesar de todas las restricciones, regulaciones y circunstancias adversas que tienen que enfrentar. Ellos son los verdaderos héroes que permiten que los porteños paseen en colectivos cómodos y con frecuencias envidiables. Mientras otros sectores viven de subsidios ingentes, otros como los propietarios de colectivos tienen que salir a competir fuertemente por brindar el mejor servicio posible al menor precio para ser elegidos y poder subsistir. Escala la disputa por la tarifa de los colectivos y en la Ciudad temen que Javier Milei quiera traspasarles las lÃneas por decreto. La medida podrÃa abrir un foco de conflicto similar al ocurrido con el subte en el aÃ±o 2012. El secretario de Transporte Franco Mogetta adelantÃ³ que NaciÃ³n dejarÃa de pagar los subsidios a los colectivos que circulen por la Capital, pero no de aquellos que circulen a ambos lados de la General Paz. La medida podrÃa ocasionar un conflicto con las empresas. \"Vas a tener dos lÃneas que tengan recorridos similares, pero como una viene de provincia va a costar una cuarta parte. La otra no va a tener pasajeros. Â¿QuÃ© le van a decir a los empresarios?\", se preguntaron desde Parque Patricios. El 29 que va desde Olivos a la Boca tiene un recorrido muy similar al 64 que une Barrancas de Belgrano con La Boca. Si NaciÃ³n avanza con el recorte de subsidios a los colectivos que solo circulan por la Ciudad, un boleto costarÃa 1400 pesos y otro 300 en promedio. [Guerra total entre Milei y Macri: NaciÃ³n le saca los subsidios al transporte y el boleto podrÃa irse a 1400 pesos](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=295999&s=8534bb5f7fc59f37bfed0af8c6332f52) El aluviÃ³n de pasajeros de una lÃnea a otra podrÃa causar un grave perjuicio al sistema, algo similar a lo que ocurre con el precio de los colectivos ($300) y el subte ($650), donde hay una marcada disminuciÃ³n de los pasajeros. Parece una cuestiÃ³n lejana en el tiempo, pero los diferentes boletos existÃan hasta que en los 90 se acordÃ³ la \"coordinaciÃ³n tarifaria\". Tras el anuncio de Mogetta, en el gobierno de la Ciudad recibieron una carta de Toto Caputo que fue la comunicaciÃ³n oficial de la medida. En el texto, sin embargo, no habÃa plazos ni condiciones para la implementaciÃ³n del recorte, cercano a los 15 mil millones de pesos, menos del 20% la coparticipaciÃ³n que Toto le retiene a Macri. La respuesta del gobierno porteÃ±o quedÃ³ a cargo de Pablo BereciartÃºa, el ministro de Infraestructura. El funcionario le recordÃ³ a Caputo que la Ciudad no tiene \"participaciÃ³n alguna\" en las decisiones sobre el financiamiento y la operaciÃ³n de los colectivos, pero, sobre todo, no maneja las tarifas. Desde la Ciudad indicaron que hacen responsable a NaciÃ³n por cualquier conflicto que pudiera haber con las empresas de transporte. En el gobierno porteÃ±o creen que Toto no tiene plan, sino que intentÃ³ ajustar las cuentas y, de paso, pelearse con Macri, una cuestiÃ³n que genera simpatÃa en la cÃºpula libertaria. Es por eso que temen que Milei quiera traspasarles los colectivos por decreto. Como quedÃ³ demostrado en 2012 con la transferencia del subte, ambas jurisdicciones deben aceptar el traspaso y debe ser ratificado por el Congreso y la Legislatura. En el medio puede abrirse una disputa de enorme magnitud. Cuando Mauricio Macri aceptÃ³ el subte, en el acta acuerdo, ademÃ¡s de los subterrÃ¡neos se incluyeron 31 lÃneas de colectivo. Sin embargo, no hubo mÃ¡s avances en la cuestiÃ³n. Tal como ocurriÃ³ con la policÃa, en la Ciudad reclaman que, si hay traspaso, se haga con los recursos para sostener las estructuras de control y todo lo necesario para operar los colectivos.

    "title": "Warm weather threatens Italy's ski season while heavy rain is leaving French Alps slopes a washout | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Holidaymakers aiming to hit the slopes in Italy and France are facing disappointment as the warmest December in Italy in 130 years and heavy rain in the French Alps threaten to wipe out the ski season. Italy's northern region of Piedmont, experiencing its warmest December since the 1890s, has seen winter resorts shutting down runs due to a lack of snow. Bardonecchia, a popular resort near the French border, has been particularly affected by a high-pressure weather system, with temperatures reaching as high as 16C in the depths of December. Resorts in the Apennine mountains outside Rome, including Terminillo and Ovindoli, have also faced challenges with inadequate snow cover, leading to the closure of slopes despite busy Christmas bookings. Meanwhile, in France, the popular resorts of Morzine and Les Gets were forced to delay the opening of the ski season due to monsoon-like downpours, with temperatures not cold enough to precipitate proper snowfall. Though some light powder has dusted pistes in recent days, more rain is expected to overrun the slopes. The disappointing conditions come after Spanish meteorologists warned that December temperatures across much of Western and Southern Europe would be far higher than normal. Ruben del Campo, a spokesperson for Spain 's national weather agency, said earlier this month that the unseasonable warmth, coupled with predictions of sparse rainfall until the end of February, heralded a 'not very good' season for winter sports that depend on abundant snow, which once melted is also a crucial water resource for the spring and summer months. Bardonecchia, a popular resort near the French border, has been particularly affected by a high-pressure weather system, with temperatures reaching as high as 16C in the depths of December Grass shows through the sparse snow on a piste in the French resort of Les Gets today Green hills that should be laden with snow in the Italian ski village of Terminillo There is barely enough snow to ski on at Le Plateau de Nyon in Morzine, France Temperatures across Spain in mid-December smashed records, pushing the mercury close to 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) in the south and delaying the start of the ski season. And several regions of Italy normally ripe for skiing at this time of year have been far warmer than usual as temperatures in the Alpine city of Turin crested 20C the week before Christmas. Enrico Rossi, director of the ski lift company Colomion and vice-president of the Bardonecchia tourism consortium, admitted that there was not enough snow to open all the slopes. 'During this period last year, we had four more [slopes] open. We have given priority to the beginner slopes, making artificial snow for them. We are postponing the opening of the difficult ones, which are also the least crowded,' he told The Telegraph . Luca Mercalli, president of the Italian Meteorological Society, attributed the rise in temperatures to global warming and warned of a grim outlook for Alpine regions, saying the temperatures he had seen in December were akin to those expected in late summer. 'The continuous increase in temperatures due to global warming will cause a further reduction in the winter season in the future, with more rain and less snow even at high altitudes. 'In the days before Christmas, to find zero degrees celsius you had to go up to almost 3,000m [9,900ft] and these are temperatures we normally find in late summer,' he added. Sunset in the Italian Alps bathes this view of the town of Bardonecchia, Piedmont Taken in a previous season, this piste in the French ski resort of Morzine shows how things should be It comes after higher temperatures and adverse weather conditions wrought havoc on the skiing World Cup in early December. Rainfall in the French Alps forced the cancellation of six races. Sharing a statement on December 10, t he International Ski and Snowboard Federation said the men's slalom - one of the centrepieces of the World Cup - could not start 'due to the present slope conditions after last night's rain and snow to ensure the safety and fairness for the racers'. The scheduled start time had already been pushed back in anticipation of course workers needing more time to clear the snow and ensure parts of the run which had been lashed by rain were safe to ski on. The race is expected to be rescheduled at a different venue later in the season.",
