O motivo do incêndio ainda é investigado. Dois tripulantes foram socorridos para um hospital da cidade. De acordo com o Corpo de Bombeiros, o acidente ocorreu por volta das 15h, quando a embarcação estava nos arredores da Praia de Capricórnio.

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighth person who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victims with ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" [Shopping Trends](https://www.ctvnews.ca/shopping.html) The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

These creatives come from disciplines including advertising, design and media.\nThe volunteers taking part in the Common People Schools Tour 25/26 will visit state schools to share their stories and outline practical pathways into the industry. The talks are intended to raise awareness by helping students from underrepresented communities understand what roles exist, what they pay and how to take the first steps into a creative career.\n‘Awareness, access, opportunity’: Creative industries urged to engage working class talent\nThe schools tour will include a flagship event where 100 state school students and industry professionals will come together to network, engage with a panel discussion and start building connections.\nOther creative organisations are encouraged to partner with Working Options by offering time and talent to support the growing network of volunteer speakers.\nThe partners believe little has changed since research released in 2020 by the Creative Industries Policy and Evidence Centre found only 16% of people in full-time creative jobs came from working class backgrounds – lower than the levels working in law, finance or academia.\n“The creative sector talks a good game when it comes to diversity, but for young people from working class backgrounds, it still feels locked behind invisible walls,” says Burch.\n“I for one had no idea that these jobs existed and found my way into the industry totally by chance. This initiative is about opening the door by showing kids the real, living proof that people like them have made it in – and they can too.”\nAt the root of this persistent lack of accessibility to creative careers is often a sense of not knowing where to begin, argues Armstrong.\n“Or not being able to ask your dad’s mate who is a film director, or an ad exec to get you some work experience,” he adds.\n“We’re flipping that by putting working class creatives directly in front of the next generation. We’re not just talking at them, but connecting to them and offering them access to the networks we never had.”\n‘Unlocking talent’\nThe scale of the issue is considerable. The government estimates the UK creative industries contributed £124.6bn of gross value added to the UK economy in 2022 alone and as of 2023 employed 2.4 million people.\n“This isn’t just about inspiration – it’s about common sense and unlocking talent, driving social mobility, and fuelling an industry that thrives on fresh voices,” says CEO of Working Options in Education, Sue Maskrey\nShe points out how important it is to open doors for young people given the latest Office for National Statistics figures found almost 1 million 16-24-year-olds were not in work, education or training as of December – an 11-year high.\nMarketing Week’s own research reveals persistent issues around pay equality.\nThe exclusive 2025 Career & Salary Survey uncovered a socio-economic pay gap for full-time workers of 15.3%, flat compared to last year’s figure at 15.9%. Some 74% of the more than 3,500 marketers surveyed identify as middle-class, up on the 70.1% figure reported in 2024. The data found a socio-economic pay gap at every level of seniority.\nThe creative sector talks a good game when it comes to diversity, but for young people from working class backgrounds, it still feels locked behind invisible walls.\nLaura Burch, Work & Class\nTo put this data into context, professionals from working class backgrounds are on average paid more than £6,000 – or 12% – less a year than more privileged peers working in the same role, according to data from the Social Mobility Foundation.\nBased on this data, last year the foundation named 17 November Class Pay Gap Day – the point at which working class professionals effectively stop being paid until the end of the year, which equates to millions of people working one in every eight days for free.\nCreative industries continue to lag behind law and finance when it comes to applications to the Social Mobility Foundation’s annual Employer Index, which ranks UK employers on the actions they are taking to open up to talent from all social backgrounds.\nThe 2024 index, published in October, saw legal firm Browne Jacobson and professional services giant PwC UK claim joint first place.\nThe foundation did, however, notice a “turnaround” in two industries with previously poor records on socio-economic diversity. The number of firms within the creative industries entering the index rose 43% in 2024, while there was a 60% annual increase in entrants from the tech sector.\nBrands such as agency group Dentsu (51), PR firm Citypress (54) and the BBC (65) joined the 2024 Employer Index, alongside the likes of Amazon (47), the Co-op (34) and Aviva (15).\nThe Social Mobility Foundation is calling on the government to introduce mandatory data collection on socio-economic background for large employers, in the same way as gender pay gap reporting. In July 2024, the Co-op became the first UK retailer to publish its socio-economic pay gap, while Zurich became the first UK insurer to do so in February 2025.\nMarketing Week’s Opening Up campaign is pushing for the democratisation of marketing careers.

    "text": "編譯曾宜婕 / 綜合報導\n正值台灣暑假，不少人考慮至歐洲旅遊，但歐洲熱浪來襲，近日因高溫致死的案例頻傳，歐洲夜間氣溫甚至高達攝氏32度。熱浪侵襲已經造成生命威脅，但時至今日，為什麼歐洲裝設冷氣的家庭仍是少數？在美國，有將近90%的家庭有冷氣，反觀歐洲卻只有約20%，在英國和德國甚至只有5%和3%。CNN 2日報導中分析了歐洲冷氣普及率低落的各個因素。在報導的最後，也整理了避暑旅遊景點提供給今年要到炎熱歐洲的旅客們。\n▲歐洲熱浪來襲，歐洲冷氣普及率卻低不到2成。（圖／美聯社／達志影像）\n歐洲電費昂貴─冷氣不是必需品而是奢侈品\nCNN報導指出，綜觀過往，歐洲國家通常不需要空調降溫，雖然熱浪有時會發生，但鮮少像現在有持續高溫的情況。此外，電費高漲也是主要因素，歐洲的電費比美國昂貴，再加上人民薪水普遍比美國低，這些原因都讓多數歐洲家庭不願意裝設冷氣。尤其在烏俄戰爭開打後，歐洲為了減少對俄羅斯的石油和天然氣依賴造成能源危機，即使現階段危機趨於穩定，冷氣所造成的額外電費仍讓歐洲人難以負擔。\n歷史悠久老屋多難裝冷氣　1/6是1900年前建\n在較為炎熱的南歐，許多建築都有散熱設計，厚實的牆壁和小窗戶可以阻擋陽光直射進屋內，也能夠強化屋內的對流以保持通風。但在其他歐洲地區，許多房子並沒有類似的散熱設計，國際能源總署（International Energy Agency, IEA）說明：「我們從沒想過要如何在夏天保持涼爽。這真的是最近因為熱浪才發生的現象。」此外，歐洲有許多歷史悠久的建築，這些建築都是在冷氣被發明前就蓋好了，而要在老舊的房子內裝設中央空調系統相對較為困難。在6月氣溫突破紀錄的英格蘭，甚至有1/6房子都是建造於1900年以前。\n為達氣溫中和目標　冷氣會拖慢進度\n雖然政府經常以影響建築美觀理由駁回許多冷氣安裝申請，但背後其實隱含著政治因素。歐洲承諾要在2050年達成氣溫中和（climate neutral），而冷氣會阻礙這項承諾的進程。冷氣運轉時會排放熱氣導致氣溫上升，一項針對巴黎冷氣使用情況的研究顯示，使用冷氣會導致室外氣溫升高攝氏2至4度，在人口稠密的地區影響將會更加嚴重。\n撐不過熱浪　歐洲冷氣數量日益上升\n歐洲和世界許多地區一樣，空調使用量正逐年增加。 IEA的報告顯示，歐盟的冷氣數量在2050年可能達到2.75億台，已經超過2019年的兩倍。也有空調的公司指出：「過去5年，居民諮詢冷氣的情況增加了2倍多。」歐洲各國正面臨使用冷氣以及溫室氣體排放的兩難，有國家陸續推出折衷政策以因應熱浪侵襲，以西班牙為例，其政府從2022年規定，公共場所的空調溫度不能低於攝氏27度。\n歐洲避暑旅遊景點總整理\n針對被熱浪侵襲的歐洲，《紐約時報》2日報導提供了遊客至歐洲旅行的實用建議。專家指出，隨時「補充水分」是重要關鍵。此外，報導也提供了地點選擇的參考指南，景點可以優先考慮有空調的室內場所，例如博物館、公共圖書館、購物中心。此外，巴黎以許多「地下景點」為名，這些景點也是非常好的避暑勝地。根據官網資料顯示，巴黎地下墓穴的平均溫度為攝氏19度，而下水道博物館經過翻新後於2021年重新開放，也是不錯的新選擇。教堂雖然沒有空調設備，但其厚實的石牆和高挑的天花板讓室內保持舒適的低溫，也很適合遊客前往參觀。\n掌握全球脈動、深入觀點分析，訂閱 一鍵看世界SET Global",
