    "text": "'I'm a celebrity hairstylist and your brushing technique could be majorly damaging your hair - it's causing breakage'\nTikTok / @joyoushealth\nBrushing your hair from roots to ends could rip hair strands out of their follicles\nWhile regular trips to the salon are essential for beautiful, healthy hair, it's important to take matters into your own hands between visits.\nA celebrity hairstylist spoke exclusively to GB News about how women can achieve better hair at home, asking hair care enthusiasts to rethink their brushing technique.\nCeleb hair guru and founder of wig brand Wigonia, Julia North, stated: \"After working in hair and owning a salon for over 10 years, I find that a holistic approach to hair care is the answer when maximising its appearance and health.\"\nMany people brush from the roots to the ends, but according to the expert, this could be causing hair havoc.\n'Start from the bottom and work in small sections to prevent breakage'\nGETTY IMAGES\"A major culprit of damaged hair is incorrect brushing technique, the expert stated.\n\"Start from the bottom and work in small sections to prevent breakage.\n\"Brush your hair when it is moist rather than soaking wet in the shower. And please invest in a quality brush. I recommend a mixed-bristle brush for daily use and a wet brush for detangling damp hair.\"\nExperts at cosmetics brand Garnier seconded this: \"It's tempting to start at the roots and brush downward to the tips. But this method of hair brushing is a recipe for yanking strands out of the follicle and causing breakage.\n\"You can maximise the benefits of brushing hair by working in sections and starting a few inches from the bottom. Then, move upward to the roots using short, slow strokes to detangle and smooth. This technique is much more efficient and is one way to prevent hair damage.\"If it's wet, use a microfibre towel to soak up most of the water, then air dry it before gently brushing.\nJulie swears by the Tangle Teezer and the Denman Detangler D38, however, there are plenty of great brushes out there to protect your strands against damage. Before investing in new products, it's always advisable to consult your hairstylist who can offer you tailored advice.\nThe hair expert also cautioned ladies about washing their hair incorrectly. She warned: \"Most people overwash their hair and use the wrong products when doing so.\n\"Unless you have an extremely oily scalp, washing two to three times a week is plenty.\n\"When you do wash, focus the shampoo on your scalp - not your ends. The suds running down will clean them sufficiently without stripping natural oils.\n\"If you have blonde or lighter hair, use a purple-tinted shampoo. This will help the colour pop and leave your strands looking vibrant.\"\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\n'When you do wash, focus the shampoo on your scalp - not your ends'\nGETTY IMAGES\nFinally, Julia advised putting down the heated tools for better hair, telling women to take a break from them \"at least two days a week\".\nShe said: \"Even good quality heat tools like the Dyson Airwrap can damage your strands if used too frequently.\"\nWhen you are using heat, there are things you can do to protect your hair though. The expert advised: \"Always use a heat protection spray (like the TRESemme Care & Protect heat spray) and work with your natural texture rather than fighting it. The best-looking hair is a combination of healthy and well-styled.\"\nIn other hair news, a woman who transformed her locks in just four months shared the styling change that helped it grow fast and healthy - \"it actually works\".",

    "text": "ANALYSIS-Missile defence successes in Gulf, Ukraine fuel global urgency to acquire systems In previous months, interceptors fired from U.S. Navy destroyers stopped Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles, while in Ukraine, U.S.-made MIM-104 Patriot batteries have shot down advanced Russian Iskander and Khinzal missiles. Reuters spoke with six experts who said more militaries would look to invest in ballistic missile defence, a potential windfall for companies such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which build those types of systems. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 03-05-2024 07:29 IST | Created: 03-05-2024 07:29 IST The success of ballistic missile defences facing their first complex, high-stakes combat scenarios in Israel, the Red Sea and Ukraine will encourage militaries globally to invest in the pricey systems, experts say - and intensify missile arms races. Iran launched as many as 120 intermediate-range ballistic missiles at Israel on April 13, U.S. and Israeli officials say. U.S. SM-3 and Israeli Arrow interceptors destroyed nearly all of them, leaving drones and smaller threats to the Iron Dome system. In previous months, interceptors fired from U.S. Navy destroyers stopped Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles, while in Ukraine, U.S.-made MIM-104 Patriot batteries have shot down advanced Russian Iskander and Khinzal missiles. Reuters spoke with six experts who said more militaries would look to invest in ballistic missile defence, a potential windfall for companies such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which build those types of systems. \"It's undeniable that any wealthy country with the technological wherewithal will continue to invest in missile defence,\" said Ankit Panda of the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a defence and security think tank. \"All of this is a recipe for a conventional arms race.\" European countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Poland already operate RTX subsidiary Raytheon's Patriot batteries, the most common Western advanced ballistic missile defence system. Saudi Arabia has used its Patriots for years to defend against Houthi attacks; it and the United Arab Emirates also operate the Lockheed Martin Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain have Patriot batteries as well, and Oman has expressed interest in missile defence. In the U.S., Lockheed Martin in April won a $17.7 billion contract for a next-generation interceptor for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program - designed to shoot down small numbers of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) aimed at the continental United States. But the impact may be most acute in Asia, where China has invested heavily in conventionally armed ballistic missiles. A 2023 Pentagon report said the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force has about 500 DF-26 missiles, designed to accurately strike targets thousands of kilometres away. That puts U.S. and allied bases in Japan and Guam within range of an attack that may only come with 20 to 30 minutes' warning. \"In the Pacific, you'll see further interest in missile defence, which will push the Chinese to build more systems,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. \"Countries will want to acquire (offensive) missiles because they see other countries using them ... That will drive up demand for missile defences.\" U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and China's Ministry of Defence did not respond to requests for comment. China rarely discusses its missile arsenal beyond statements that its forces are meant to preserve peace and are not aimed at any specific country. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson referred questions to the company's first-quarter earnings briefing in late April, in which it said it continued to lead the industry in \"missile defence missions, which, given world events, are becoming more critical than ever\". DOLLAR SIGNS Ballistic missile defence works by spotting an attacking weapon either at launch or in flight, then using a surface-based radar to guide an interceptor to the target. Interceptions can occur in the atmosphere or in space, and each domain requires different hardware. For instance, fins won't work outside the atmosphere - interceptors must have small steering rockets to function there. The necessary high-powered computers, far-seeing radars and missiles as large as telephone poles are not cheap, together stretching into the billions. In 2022, for example, the U.S. approved the sale of both Patriots and THAAD systems to Saudi Arabia, in deals worth as much as $5.3 billion. In the Indo-Pacific region, wealthier countries such as Japan, Australia and South Korea are prime candidates for missile defence, Lewis said, while nearly every country in Asia is already investing in missiles. Japan's defence ministry said the country \"needs to fundamentally and swiftly reinforce its defence capabilities, including integrated air and missile defence\". It said it is investing in improved Patriot missiles, better radars and enhanced naval anti-missile capabilities. In its latest defence budget, South Korea increased funding by 12% for its Korea Air and Missile Defense System to expand it \"from the existing lower-level defence concept,\" the country's defence ministry said in a statement. \"Cases such as the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war have reaffirmed the importance of a 'ballistic missile defence system' to respond to increasingly sophisticated missile threats,\" the ministry said. In mid-April, Australia announced a A$500 million ($328 million) contract with Lockheed Martin to deliver its Joint Air Battle Management System for tracking and destroying aircraft and missiles. The cost of a ballistic missile is often much cheaper than the system meant to stop it. But that isn't the right way to consider cost, said Yoji Koda, former commander in chief of Japan's Self-Defense Fleet, and an advocate of stronger missile defences in his country. \"In a war economy, the cheaper the better. But sometimes what is necessary, is we need to protect key infrastructure, or key command centres, at any cost. Because without them we would lose.\" THE CHINA QUESTION Most of China's conventionally armed ballistic missiles are designed to hit targets on land. But it also fields steerable warheads meant to hit ships at sea, including the DF-21D and variants of the DF-26, developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. Such anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) had never been used in combat until late 2023, when Houthi forces in Yemen began firing Iranian-made models at ships in the Red Sea. Between November - the first documented use - and April, U.S. Central Command reported at least 85 ASBMs fired in the region, with 20 interceptions and one civilian ship reported sunk. CENTCOM has declined to provide specifics about the effectiveness of Iranian ASBMs but has noted missiles posing no threat were not engaged and most that were not intercepted landed harmlessly. The effectiveness of missile defences on land and at sea will catch China's attention, said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the Nuclear Policy Program and Carnegie China. \"It raises the possibility that the U.S. and its allies could depend on missile defence significantly against a ballistic missile attack,\" Zhao said. Although the technical specifics of China's missiles are closely held secrets, the country's heavy investment means they are likely to be more reliable, and are widely believed to use complex countermeasures to complicate interception. \"For opponents such as China which have missile stockpiles an order of magnitude larger than that of Russia or Iran and which field more sophisticated systems ... it's not clear that the lessons learned invalidate existing operational constructs,\" said Sidarth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. But the political and practical incentives to invest in missile defence will be too attractive for many countries to ignore, Lewis said. \"All defence procurement decisions are ultimately about politics,\" he said. \"The politics of this stuff is really simple: do you want to defend the country or not? And the winning answer is always 'Yes'.\" ($1 = 1.5225 Australian dollars) (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Presenta una infección en las vías respiratorias a causa de una anemia y ha requerido transfusiones de sangre, tal y como detalla el último parte médico. La salud de Francisco había experimentado una ligera mejora después de su ingreso en el hospital.

    "title": "Germany's Catholic Church speaks out against far right – DW – 02/23/2024",
    "text": "Catholic bishops meeting in the city of Augsburg this week strongly condemned the rise of ethnic nationalism and right-wing extremism in German society.\n\"Right-wing extremist parties and those that run rampant on the fringes of this ideology can therefore not be a place of political activity for Christians and are also not electable,\" they said in a statement.\nOn this point, the bishops made an explicit reference to the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) . They said the party's beliefs are \"incompatible with the Christian image of God and humankind.\"\nThe statement is highly unusual because for the past 25 years, the Catholic bishops have been reluctant to offer any assessments of political parties.\nThe head of the Bishops' Conference, Bishop Georg Bätzing, explained that the more than 60 bishops deliberated at length over making a statement, but agreed it was necessary. He also pointed out that the declaration had been adopted unanimously.\n\"After several spurts of radicalization,\" the statement reads, \"the AfD is now dominated by a nationalistic attitude.\" It goes on to point out that the AfD oscillates between genuine right-wing extremism, which the domestic intelligence agency has documented in some regional branches and in the party's youth organization, and less radical right-wing populism .\nThe statement against the far right was adopted unanimously at the meeting in Augsburg Image: Annette Zöpf/EPD-Bild/picture alliance The statement specifically denounces hostility toward refugees, migrants and Muslims , and \"to an increasing extent\" Jews .\nThe bishops indicated that they will hold full-time church employees and volunteers to account. \"Moreover, the circulation of right-wing extremist slogans — which includes racism and antisemitism in particular — is incompatible with full-time or volunteer service in the Church.\"\nA religious alliance against the far right In early December, the Protestant Church in Germany also issued a statement on the AfD, declaring that the party's stance is \"in no way compatible with the principles of the Christian faith.\" Jewish and Muslim communities have also issued warnings, indicating there is a broad religious alliance against the AfD.\nGermany has seen two months of large street protests against the hateful rhetoric and political vision of Germany's far right. They began after a report was published on January 10 by investigative journalism group Correctiv about a meeting of various right-wing and far-right figures, including some AfD members, to discuss the expulsion of millions of people with a migrant background living in Germany.\nSeveral bishops have recently taken part in these demonstrations against right-wing extremism. Bätzing participated in a demonstration in his episcopal city of Limburg, while the bishop of Mainz, Peter Kohlgraf, warned against xenophobia at a demonstration in the Rhineland-Palatinate state capital of Mainz. In Augsburg, Bishop Bertram Meier announced the church's opposition to dehumanizing and anti-democratic politics.\nBishop Gerhard Feige of Magdeburg was probably the most outspoken, cautioning against \"demagogues\" and \"incendiary opportunists.\" He warned: \"Let's not fall for lies, the distortion of facts, and the 'poison of simple solutions!'\"\nGerman Christians have been speaking out against the far right using the slogan 'our cross has no hooks' (in reference to the swastika Nazi symbol) Image: Bernd Wüstneck/ZB/dpa/picture alliance Catholics in the eastern part of Germany, where the AfD is set to become the strongest political force after parliamentary elections in three states later this year, have been more vocal than their Western counterparts and have explicitly spoken out on the AfD.\nClaudio Kullmann, the head of the Catholic Office in Erfurt and the church's liaison office for state politics for the past six years, was one of the orators at the bishops' meeting in Augsburg. Erfurt is located in the eastern state of Thuringia, where the AfD currently polls at over 30%, although the state branch has been classified as \"confirmed right-wing extremist by the intelligence service.\nKullmann said the presence of a nationalist ethos and AfD-like thinking endangers social cohesion and \"could even erode trust among friends.\"\nThe Augsburg decision will certainly heighten the excitement surrounding the upcoming Catholic Day 2024. From May 29 to June 2, Catholics will gather in Erfurt, only 13 weeks before the Thuringia election — with right-wing extremist Björn Höcke as the leading AfD candidate. According to a court ruling, the radical AfD politician can be labeled a fascist.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nDefiance in Germany: Can mass protests stop the far right?

    "text": "El empresario Elon Musk es reconocido por impulsar grandes proyectos y empresas que aspiran a producir grandes cambios en la humanidad. Ahora, el magnate afirma saber cómo satisfacer, de una vez por todas, las necesidades de energía de la sociedad actual.\nEl multimillonario sudafricano creador de Starlink, Tesla y SpaceX afirma que un enorme reactor de fusión “en el cielo” podría ser capaz de proveer toda la energía eléctrica que se necesita. Además, dijo que ese reactor ya existe.\nEn concreto, Musk se refiere al Sol y asegura que actualmente la humanidad no está aprovechando toda la energía que su estrella le provee. Así lo afirmó en una entrevista que dio en el popular podcast estadounidense “The Joe Rogan Experience”.\nGoogle te escucha siempre: así podés desactivar el micrófono de tu celular en simples pasos\nPrivacidad en riesgo\nGoogle te escucha siempre: así podés desactivar el micrófono de tu celular en simples pasos\nPablo Fiuza, de CESSI:\nEntrevista\nPablo Fiuza, de CESSI: “La inteligencia artificial obliga a la industria del software y sus talentos a reinventarse” Energía para siempre: cómo es el plan de Elon Musk Con el objetivo de mostrar que su idea sobre la energía solar no fue solo una declaración al pasar, Elon Musk detalló a Joe Rogan un plan concreto para alimentar con electricidad de ese origen a los Estados Unidos.\nEn este sentido, el magnate considera que una gran planta fotovoltaica con una superficie aproximada de 160 x 160 kilómetros bastaría para cubrir las necesidades energéticas de los Estados Unidos. “Esa cosa simplemente funciona. Tenemos un reactor de fusión gigante en el cielo”, expresó, entusiasta, Elon Musk.\nDe funcionar esa idea, plantas similares se podrían instalar en otros territorios, utilizando la misma tecnología y, por supuesto, el mismo “reactor de fusión”.\nEl plan de Elon Musk: ¿energía gratis? Claro que no se trataría de energía totalmente gratuita. El gran proyecto de Musk requeriría una enorme inversión y producción de elementos para poder concretarse. Entre ellos paneles solares y baterías.\nSin embargo, esto resultaría en un importante negocio para el mismo Musk. En el año 2016 el multimillonario adquirió por u$s 2.600 millones la compañía SolarCity, dedicada especialmente a la producción de sistemas de producción de energía solar.\nAdemás, la empresa Tesla ya ofrece paneles solares y paquetes de baterías para proporcionar energía a hogares y empresas en los Estados Unidos.",

    "title": "LA Dining Experts Discuss Their Biggest Hopes for the Restaurant Industry in 2024",
    "text": "Welcome to the [Year in Eater 2023](https://la.eater.com/year-in-eater) — our annual tradition that looks back at the highs, lows, and in-betweens of Los Angeles’s restaurant scene. Today, LA’s finest food writers, editors, reporters, and a few select others with strong opinions share their biggest hopes for the restaurant industry in 2024 and beyond. Gary Baum, Senior Writer, The Hollywood Reporter That there isn’t another entertainment industry labor strike. The Teamsters and IATSE’s contracts are expiring next year — which would affect local diners’ pocketbooks. Bill Esparza, contributor, Eater LA My hope is that diners in Los Angeles mature. America, and LA, is newer as a dining destination, and Angelenos are so fickle and subject to trends. We tend to miss the bigger picture on why LA is the best place to dine. I’d like to see more coverage for our Latin American restaurants, but I believe that begins with diners. In terms of Mexican cuisine, there is a lack of support for Indigenous-owned restaurants and our incredible fondas. Mexican and Central American restaurants are dominant, vital, and fundamental to our city, and continue to be undervalued. Besides, there’s better game hen at our Salvadoran, and Guatemalan restaurants. Farley Elliott, SoCal Bureau Chief, SFGate This city is filled with fluctuations and unexpected turns, from interest rates and cost of goods to rent and labor changes. I’m mostly hoping for a peaceful year of happy, celebratory eating. Kristie Hang, contributor, Eater LA I hope the higher-end fine-dining restaurants serving ethnic food can make it. I often hear people complain that Los Angeles doesn’t have the same caliber of nice Asian restaurants as San Francisco or Orange County. The challenge arises when, for example, Chinese food is perceived as not worth the higher price tag. While it’s fair for individuals to find a meal expensive, it becomes disheartening when some say that a certain ethnic meal is never inherently worth that much. Interestingly, these same individuals might not hesitate to spend a similar amount on a steakhouse or Japanese omakase. I assure you preparing a Peking Duck is much more difficult than grilling a tomahawk steak. Alison Herman, TV Critic, Variety That conversations around big-picture issues like gentrification and food costs don’t demonize or place an undue burden on individual businesses, who are making choices within an incentive structure they don’t fully control. Restaurants should be applauded for doing what they can! I just hope they aren’t punished for reaching their limits while also keeping their heads above water. Mona Holmes, Reporter, Eater LA Two things. First, restaurants need to receive additional support after a wildly unpredictable year. I would love our mayor, governor, and city to further recognize how challenging restaurant operations can be outside of the six months straight of rain, actor/writer strikes, and rising costs. And two, that diners embrace empathy. Prices are high for everyone, and it’s showing up on our grocery store AND restaurant receipts. Goods and services have gone way up. Through conversations and looking at social media comments, people are constantly complaining about it. I don’t like it either, but this is the new normal. Restaurant owners don’t want to piss you off, they are just trying to pay employees and rent. But there is a bigger thing at play: if you don’t support your local restaurant, it will disappear. Like so many closures we’ve seen in 2023. Lesley Suter, Interim Editorial Lead/Special Projects Editor, Eater In all honesty and cheesiness: Kindness. Kindness from patrons, in particular; there are some absolutely wild behaviors floating around that are outright poisonous. Kindness from restaurateurs and chefs toward their staff; we all need to make a buck but it doesn’t always have to be about that. Matthew Kang, Lead Editor, Eater LA More transparency about equitable pay, comfortable and fair working conditions, and fiscal responsibility from operators. There are just too many stakeholders in the restaurant industry, and we need to think of restaurant businesses more holistically. I’m hoping to focus more of my own coverage on these aspects as well, and if there are restaurants that aren’t, then hopefully the reporting will keep them in account. Evan Lovett, founder, L.A. in a Minute I hope that the Los Angeles restaurant scene continues to thrive. We truly have the most diverse excellence of any culinary city on the globe, and each neighborhood has gems that deserve recognition. I love to see new chefs emerge, and new cuisines and dishes introduced and celebrated here in LA. Joshua Lurie, founder, FoodGPS.com My hope is that we have at least a couple more years until restaurateurs develop menus using AI programs instead of people, replace chefs with robots, and deliver food with a fleet of drones. That’s all but inevitable for the lowest common denominator tech bros. Until then, let’s continue to celebrate the people with personal visions who make the food world exciting and unique. Elina Shatkin, KCRW I’d like to believe that the pandemic, which exposed many of the inequalities and endemic problems of both the hospitality industry and our food supply chain, would lead to better working conditions and more sustainable business models in the food world but I’m not optimistic about human nature. Especially when it’s warped by the crushing power of late-stage capitalism. So I have no realistic hope for the hospitality industry in 2024. I would, however, love to see it become more hospitable for the people who work in it, at every level. Jean Trinh, freelance reporter It’s been really painful and heartbreaking to see so many restaurants close this year, some of which had been longtime Los Angeles institutions. I hope the economy gets better next year so that it won’t be such a struggle to keep a restaurant open.",
