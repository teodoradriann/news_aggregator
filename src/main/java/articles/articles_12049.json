    "text": "Kehlkopfkrebs: Zwei zentrale Risikofaktoren, die vermeidbar sind\nMänner erkranken häufiger an Kehlkopfkrebs, wobei zwei bedeutende Risikofaktoren im Fokus stehen. Frühe Warnsignale sollten nicht unterschätzt werden.\nFrankfurt – In Deutschland erkranken jährlich etwa 3.600 Männer und 500 Frauen an Kehlkopfkrebs, auch Larynxkarzinom genannt. Die Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft gibt an, dass die Betroffenen im Durchschnitt 68 Jahre alt sind, wobei Männer häufiger betroffen sind als Frauen. Tumore entwickeln sich meist im Bereich der Stimmlippen und können bei frühzeitiger Erkennung oft erfolgreich therapiert werden. Zudem sind die beiden Hauptrisikofaktoren vermeidbar und somit das Risiko, an Kehlkopfkrebs zu erkranken, reduzierbar.\nZwei vermeidbare Risikofaktoren begünstigen die Entwicklung von Kehlkopfkrebs\nTabak- und Alkoholkonsum gelten als die Hauptursachen für Kehlkopfkrebs. Der Tabakkonsum steht in direktem Zusammenhang mit der Wahrscheinlichkeit, an dieser Krankheit zu erkranken, wobei sowohl die Intensität als auch die Dauer des Konsums eine Rolle spielen. Dies berichtet die Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft.\nEin weiterer wesentlicher Risikofaktor ist der übermäßige Konsum von Alkohol. Besonders gefährlich wird es, wenn beide Faktoren zusammenkommen. Das Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) weist darauf hin, dass die Kombination aus langjährigem Rauchen und regelmäßigem, starkem Alkoholkonsum besonders schädlich ist.\nKehlkopfkrebs: Weitere Risikofaktoren, die man kennen sollte\nNeben den Hauptursachen gibt es weitere Faktoren, die das Risiko für Kehlkopfkrebs erhöhen können. Berufliche Exposition gegenüber Schadstoffen wie Asbest und schwefelsäurehaltigen Gasen (Aerosolen) zählt dazu, wie netdoktor.de berichtet. Auch bestimmte Virusinfektionen, insbesondere mit humanen Papillomaviren (HPV), können zur Entstehung von Kehlkopfkrebs beitragen, so die Apotheken Umschau.\nKehlkopfkrebs lässt sich jedoch vermeiden. Durch den Verzicht auf Rauchen und die Reduzierung oder den vollständigen Verzicht auf Alkohol können Betroffene ihr persönliches Risiko erheblich senken. Frühe Warnzeichen von Kehlkopfkrebs wie anhaltende Heiserkeit, dauerhaftes Halskratzen, Räusperzwang und chronischer Husten sollten ernst genommen und zeitnah von einem Arzt untersucht werden. Bei rechtzeitiger Diagnose und Behandlung sind die Heilungschancen bei Kehlkopfkrebs deutlich besser als in fortgeschrittenen Stadien. (jbr)",

    "text": "NEW CPI REPORT: Core Inflation at Lowest Point in 3+ Years Thanks to President Biden\nJuly 11, 2024\nPresident Biden’s Economic Agenda Is Reducing Inflation While Trump Would Raise Prices on Working Families\nToday’s\nCPI report shows that President Biden is making significant progress fighting inflation and bolstering the economy from the bottom up and middle out. Thanks to President Biden’s leadership, core inflation is the lowest it has been in more than three years. The American people are seeing one of the strongest job markets in American history with 15.7 million jobs created, rising wages, and historically low unemployment rates, and this month, they’re also seeing lower costs on expenses ranging from electricity to gas and airfare prices. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is promising more tax breaks for the ultra-rich on the backs of middle-class Americans while rooting for the economy to crash for his own political gain. The contrast is clear: President Biden is dedicated to delivering economic results for hardworking families, while Trump is running on the same disastrous trickle-down MAGAnomics agenda to help his billionaire backers instead of the American people.\nPresident Biden is fighting to bring down inflation, with core inflation at its lowest point in over three years.\nHeather Long, Washington Post: “JUST IN: Good news on inflation. Inflation rose just 3.0% (y/y) in June — among the lowest since early 2021.\nA decline in gas prices and energy really helped cool off inflation more in June.\nJune monthly inflation increase: -0.1%\nPast year inflation: +3.0%\nCore CPI: +3.3% —>Lowest since April 2021”\nCNN: “US consumer prices did something in June that they haven’t done since the early part of the pandemic: They fell.\n“Consumer prices dropped 0.1% on a monthly basis, helping to bring the annual rate of inflation to 3% from 3.3% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest Consumer Price Index report.\n“Falling gas prices as well as a drop in new and used car prices helped to usher in the overall decline, which marks the first month-on-month decline since May 2020, BLS data showed.”\nAccording to Moody’s Analytics, Donald Trump’s MAGAnomics agenda will slow down economic growth and cause higher inflation, even triggering a recession by 2025.\nUSA Today: “‘Biden’s policies are better for the economy,’ says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. ‘They lead to more growth and less inflation.\n“According to a\nMoody’s study, Trump’s plan would trigger a recession by mid-2025 and an economy that grows an average 1.3% annually during his four-year term vs. 2.1% under Biden. (The latter is in line with average growth in the decade before the pandemic.)\n“Next year, under a Trump administration, inflation would rise from the current 3.3% to 3.6%, well above the 2.4% forecast under Biden, the Moody’s analysis shows. Compared with Biden, the U.S. would have 3.2 million fewer jobs and a 4.5% unemployment rate, a half percentage point higher, at the end of a Trump tenure.”\nTrump actively rooted for the U.S. economy to crash for his own political benefit, regardless of how it would affect hardworking Americans.\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/politics/trump-economy-crash/index.html: “Trump says he hopes any economic crash would happen before he could serve a possible second term.”\n“When there’s a crash, I hope it’s going to be during this next 12 months because I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover. The one president – I just don’t want to be Herbert Hoover,” Trump said in an interview that aired Monday on the right-wing platform Lindell TV.”\n he hopes economy crashes in next 12 months: ‘I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover’” https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/09/donald-trump-hopes-economy-crashes-in-2024/72159263007/: “Donald Trump says he hopes economy tanks this election year ‘because I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover’”",

    "text": "By Sophia Hall ,\n4 hours ago\nNEW YORK (1010 WINS/WCBS 880) – Police, state troopers, and K-9 units are conducting an ongoing investigation in a wooded area on Long Island believed to be linked to the Gilgo Beach murders, according to sources.\n“The Suffolk County Police Department, the New York Police Department and the New York State Police are working with the District Attorney's Office on an ongoing investigation,”the office of Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said in a statement. “We do not comment on investigative steps while they are underway. We will make further statements when appropriate.”\nThe Suffolk County District Attorney's Office did not provide further details, but a source familiar with the investigation confirmed that the search is connected to the Gilgo Beach murder investigations.\nA search has been ongoing in a wooded area off Wading River Manor Road in Manorville. Police dogs were also deployed in a different section of the woods off Ryerson Avenue near the Maples bar.\nRex Heuermann, 60, the main suspect in the Gilgo Beach murder, has remained jailed in Riverhead since his arrest last July outside his Midtown architectural consultant firm. He has maintained his innocence after being charged with the murders of four women—known as the “Gilgo Four”—whose remains were found along Ocean Parkway near Gilgo Beach in 2010 and 2011.\nLocal residents expressed support for the authorities' efforts to solve the long-standing case. \"I guess they have to do something in order to complete the task,” One resident told WCBS 880. “It’s a sad thing.”\nHopes remain high within the community that the search efforts will get some findings. “Better late than never. Hopefully they'll find something,\" said one local.\nInvestigators are committed to continuing the search in the area through the weekend.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Slayman, de 62 años, expresó su felicidad en un comunicado emitido por el hospital, calificando este momento como uno de los más felices de su vida.\nEste hito médico marca el tercer trasplante de órgano de cerdo modificado genéticamente en la historia. A diferencia de los dos receptores anteriores, que murieron poco después de la operación, Slayman no ha mostrado signos de rechazo del órgano trasplantado. Los médicos han confirmado que el riñón está funcionando adecuadamente, lo que permitió el alta del paciente.\nEn sus declaraciones, Slayman expresó su gratitud hacia quienes lo han apoyado y compartió su emoción por poder retomar su vida cotidiana libre de la diálisis que había afectado su calidad de vida durante años. Su recuperación está progresando sin problemas, aunque ha pedido intimidad en estos momentos.\nEl trasplante de riñón de cerdo modificado genéticamente se realizó como parte de un protocolo de uso compasivo, que permite el acceso a tratamientos experimentales en casos de enfermedades graves y potencialmente mortales cuando no existen alternativas de tratamiento comparables. Sin embargo, se necesitan más ensayos para autorizar este procedimiento de manera generalizada.\nEste avance médico, llevado a cabo por el Hospital General de Massachusetts en colaboración con la empresa eGenesis, abre nuevas posibilidades en el campo de los trasplantes de órganos. Con la escasez de órganos humanos disponibles para trasplante, los xenotrasplantes representan una esperanza para miles de pacientes que aguardan un trasplante.\nSegún datos de la Red Unida para Compartir Órganos (UNOS), más de 100.000 personas en Estados Unidos están en lista de espera para un trasplante de órgano, y las tasas de insuficiencia renal terminal están en aumento. El riñón es el órgano más demandado para trasplantes, lo que subraya la importancia de los avances en xenotrasplantes para abordar esta creciente necesidad. @mundiario",

    "title": "Farmer Focus: Agriculture bears brunt of changing weather - Farmers Weekly",
    "text": "Farmer Focus: Agriculture bears brunt of changing weather From the start of the 2023/24 season, all that seems to have happened is that I’ve dug myself into a deeper and deeper hole. I have no option but to keep battling on as I need grain, forage and utmost straw to run a feedlot, servicing in the region of 4,000 finishing cattle a year. Yes, I could buy in feed and co-products, but the economics works better for the feedlot and customer if the vast majority is home grown. Straw at £100/tonne does not stack up at all. See also: [Opinion: Straw prices are giving me heart palpitations](https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/opinion-straw-prices-are-giving-me-heart-palpitations) The mental strain weighing down on the industry is palpable. The only way I’ve stayed semi-sane is talking to my mate Neil and “cussing” everything up hill and down dale, and laughing about it all in the end. It doesn’t matter which sector you’re in, it has been brutal. I feel for anyone that has had to lamb through this, tend to outdoor pigs, plant potatoes… the list goes on. We have just finished a monumentally challenging spring drilling season. It was a seat-of-the-pants operation, dodging wet holes. We still haven’t got the maize drilled at time of writing. On numerous occasions, we nearly buried the Challenger. The problem we have with that machine is we have nothing bigger to rive (force) it out with. We are all sick of what seems like “Operation Popeye” (the classified US mission to extend the monsoon season over the Ho Chi Minh Trail). Weather patterns are changing, but as a result of climate change. Agriculture is bearing the brunt of it, and eventually the population will, when food becomes scarce. I would say that we have gone well past the tipping point of mitigating weather extremes, and if these weather events continue on regular four-year cycles, we must review our cropping practices – what we grow and when. I noticed the recent EU delegation to the UK had a meeting with George Monbiot. At least one positive I can draw of late, and a benefit of Brexit, is not having to take farming advice from him unlike the rest of the EU 27.",

    "text": "El Corte Inglés, colaborador de Marató bp Castelló, acompaña a los corredores y corredoras hacia una meta más sostenible El centro comercial, punto desde el que parte la competición, pondrá su parking a disposición de los corredores y corredoras de la prueba El próximo 25 de febrero, Marató bp Castelló y 10K FACSA Castelló, vivirán su decimocuarta y undécima edición, respectivamente. El Corte Inglés continúa colaborando con una prueba que ya es un referente en el atletismo a nivel internacional. Y lo hace aportando su parking para que los runners, en el caso de que se desplacen en coche, puedan aparcarlo cómodamente y de forma gratuita antes de iniciar la carrera. Tanto la maratón con la prueba de 10k saldrán de la avenida Vila-Real, junto a las instalaciones del centro y finalizará en el Parque Ribalta, a escasos metros del mismo. Así, el Corte Inglés adaptará sus horarios de su parking para que esté disponible el domingo de la prueba desde las 07:30 a las 15:30. Una carrera alineada con la sostenibilidad La cesión del parking de El Corte Inglés, además de facilitar la logística de los corredores y corredoras el día de la prueba, tiene el beneficio añadido de generar menos emisiones contaminantes, evitando que los participantes den vueltas con el coche para buscar aparcamiento en un momento, además, en el que se necesita la máxima concentración. Este es un ejemplo del camino que está recorriendo Marató bp Castelló y 10K FACSA Castelló hacia una meta más verde y más respetuosa con el entorno. El Corte Inglés, por su parte, también está implementando acciones sostenibles dentro de su apuesta general por la Sostenibilidad y así en 2022 inauguró su Punto Limpio para clientes dentro del propio parking que utilizarán los corredores, donde se pueden depositar desde dispositivos electrónicos en desuso hasta ropa y calzado, pasando por pilas o pequeños electrodomésticos, con la seguridad de que todo residuo se aprovecha, se recicla y gana una segunda vida útil. Este Punto Limpio se enmarca dentro del proyecto de Residuo Cero, certificado por AENOR, con el que El Corte Inglés de Castelló ha sido capaz de valorizar más de un 95% de los residuos que genera y evita lanzar miles de toneladas al vertedero, siendo empresa pionera en Sostenibilidad en el sector de la distribución. Además, con motivo de la Maratón, El Corte Inglés ofrecerá a todos sus clientes un 30% de bonificación en textil y calzado de Running, del 19 al 25 de febrero de 2024 en su centro de Castellón. El canje de estas bonificaciones se podrá realizar en todo el departamento de Deportes, del 19 al 27 de febrero de 2024, en El Corte Inglés Castellón, web y app, además de la promoción 3x2 en nutrición deportiva. Las inscripciones para Marató bp Castelló y 10K FACSA Castelló, coorganizadas por el Club d´Atletisme Running Castelló y el Patronato Municipal de Deportes del Ayuntamiento de Castelló, todavía están abiertas.
