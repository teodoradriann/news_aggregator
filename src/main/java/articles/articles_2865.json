    "text": "The Chicago Red Stars place defender and three-time Iron Woman Sam Staab on the season-ending injury list after suffering a torn Achilles tendon vs. Gotham. Alex Singer and the Houston Dash part ways as the club continues to make the headlines for everything but its play on the pitch. Portland Thorns FC announce the addition of new investors including Brandin Cooks and Bryce Young. By Caden Charpentier | 10:48 PM EDT\nChicago Red Stars v Seattle Reign FC / Alika Jenner/GettyImages\nNWSL news: Three-time Iron Woman Sam Staab sees season cut short, placed on SEI list for a torn Achilles tendon When the former fourth overall selection in the 2019 NWSL College Draft Sam Staab needed help to get off the pitch over the weekend in the Summer Cup opener, many of us feared the worst. It's never a good sign when someone goes down with a non-contact injury. The Chicago Red Stars broke the news on Thursday. And it wasn't good. The 27-year-old, who had propelled herself into the USWNT conversation this season, is now out for the remainder of the campaign due to a torn Achilles tendon. She will be placed on the National Women’s Soccer League season-ending injury list.\nChicago dealt for Staab on draft night in January for the third overall selection before inking a three year extension in March, following a five-year tenure with the Washington Spirit. During her time in the nation's capital, the defender earned the prestigious Iron Woman title on three occasions, making her only the fourth player in the league's history to accomplish the feat.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by sam staab (@sam_staab)\nTrue fans of the NWSL knew she deserved a USWNT call-up long before she actually received one. Staab made her debut off the bench for the Stars and Stripes on June 1 and played all 90 minutes in the second friendly against the Korea Republic three days later.\nShe also holds the NWSL record for consecutive starts at 105. Nothing was stopping her from making her second successive appearance on the NWSL Best XI First Team. 101 clearances. 90 long passes completed. Both are top two among non-goalkeepers in the NWSL this season.\nHer dependability and proficiency in distribution out of the back are unmatched by anyone in the NWSL today. It's a devasting blow for Lorne Donaldson's Red Stars with the club fighting to remain above the playoff cut line. Chicago is currently seventh (7-7-2, 23 points) in the NWSL table, five points above Bay FC in eighth place with 10 matches left.\n“We are disheartened to learn the extent of Sam’s injury,” said Richard Feuz , Chicago's GM. “Over her short time with the club, Sam has fully committed herself to her teammates and been a wonderful leader on and off the pitch. As Sam begins the recovery process, we will ensure that we provide the support she needs so she can rest and focus on her health.”\nHannah Anderson and Natalia Kuikka are right now the only healthy center backs on Chicago's roster.\nNWSL news: Amid a brutal stretch, the Houston Dash part ways with general manager Alex Singer after nearly two years in the role Consistency and the Houston Dash have never been synonymous with one another. That statement continued to ring true as Alex Singer was sacked by the club on Thursday - 703 days after taking the job at Octagon, a global agency in sports, entertainment, and culture.\nThe question remains: who is next to clean up a mess that has been present even before Singer took the job?\nPer the club , \"the search for a new general manager will begin immediately.\"\nThe drama off the pitch has been a constant this season. In April, Maria Sanchez demanded a trade just months after signing an extension with the Dash through 2026. More recently, head coach Fran Alonso has been missing from the sidelines for what the club says is an \"illness\" since June 27. Is it an \"illness\" or much more? Who knows but what we do know is that this club desperately needs some stability.\nSinger did some positive things, most significantly when it came to hitting on her draft picks and bringing in Tarciane, but the results under her hand-picked coaches speak for themselves. Ahead of 2023, we all had Houston as a postseason contender. Now, all you can say is this club has moved in the wrong direction.\nOther than that Challenge Cup triumph in 2020, success has been hard to come by for the Houston Dash. Since Juan Carlos Amorós' successful stint in charge, Houston has looked toothless going forward, scoring 27 goals across the last 38 regular season contests. For context, Kansas City has scored 70 goals over that same stretch.\nNWSL news: Noteworthy national and local investors join Portland Thorns FC with its focus on ensuring \"strong integration and representation of local voices in club leadership\" The list of well-known investors around the league continues to expand. Less than seven months after the ownership of Portland Thorns FC changed hands, Lisa Bhathal Merage and Alex Bhathal have added six current and former athletes as new investors in the club. Four of these athletes are either residents or natives of the Portland area.\nBryce Young, the current Carolina Panthers quarterback, is among the group put together by Revitate, \"an alternative investment platform led by the Bhathals focused on transformative investments into sports, real estate, and consumer brands.\"\nThe other investors include Joey Harrington, the ex-Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year and Oregon alumnus; the current Cowboy wideout Brandin Cooks; Ashton Eaton and Brianne Theisen-Eaton, two Olympic medalists who both went to Oregon; and Jeremy Ebobisse, the forward for the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer.\n“We are thrilled to welcome such an accomplished group of athletes into the Thorns investor group,” said Bhathal Merage. “This is truly a group of champions – both in their respective sports and as leaders in the Portland community. We are excited and honored to access their talents, insights, and passion as we continue the work needed to build the best women’s soccer club in the world.”\nAdditional present and former sports figures with ownership stakes in NWSL outfits consist of Patrick Mahomes, Naomi Osaka, Matthew Stafford, Serena Williams, Billie Jean King, Abby Wambach, Tim Howard, and James Harden, to name just a few.\nfeed\nHome / NWSL",

    "text": "The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has completed the removal of over 6156.94 metric tonnes (MT) of silt and construction and demolition waste from the capital in the last 10 days, according to officials. Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena in a review meeting held on September 20 directed the authorities to launch an anti-dust drive, which was to be converted into a year-long campaign. He had advised the road-owning agencies mainly the MCD and Public Works Department (PWD) to clear the dust from roads, take measures to avoid letting it settle and transport it to designated dumping sites. Authorities such as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), Irrigation and Flood Control Department (IFCD), and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) were directed to coordinate in removing silt. In 12 MCD Zones, 404.65 MT of waste was removed on September 24 and by Wednesday the officials managed to clear 6156.94 MT of waste. As per the officials, the Shahdara South Zone made the most significant progress in the waste removal drive by clearing 1230.76 MT in the last 10 days, followed by Keshavpuram Zone that removed 1019.67 MT of waste. The silt will be transported to designated dumping sites for proper disposal and bioremediation, said the civic body. Earlier, the L-G's office had said that the major contributors to air pollution in Delhi are road dust and dried up mud or silt accumulated on roads.",

    "title": "Questions mount over six hostages’ fate in Gaza after IDF finds gunshot wounds | World News | koamnewsnow.com",
    "text": "Tel Aviv (CNN) — Fury was palpable at the end of a demonstration in Tel Aviv on Thursday, as protesters demanded a deal to free Israeli hostages in Gaza and grieved this week’s news that the bodies of six captives had been retrieved. Their tragic fate has raised fears that more Israeli hostages will not be retrieved alive either, said one protester. “We need to bring back those that we know were alive,” Daniel told CNN. Continuing war as negotiations for a ceasefire-hostage deal falter “will only bring more coffins to them and to us,” the 48-year-old added. There has been no official explanation yet of how the six died. On Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that initial forensic tests suggest that all six hostages had been shot, but it has not determined whether the gunshot wounds were the cause of death. IDF also underlined that the findings are preliminary. The IDF said four additional bodies were found next to the bodies of the six hostages, which were believed to be those of the Hamas militants who had been holding the hostages, but that no evidence of shooting was found on their bodies. The IDF did not name any alleged shooter. But standing outside Israel’s Ministry of Defense, Daniel said the IDF’s announcement that all six hostages had been shot underlines the potential danger in rescue operations that depend on force. Israeli outlet Ynet had reported on Tuesday that an IDF preliminary assessment was that the hostages may have died due to suffocation after the IDF hit a nearby Hamas target and carbon dioxide flooded the tunnel where they were being held. Asked in a news conference on Tuesday whether the IDF had killed the hostages, spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not clarify whether the hostages had been killed as a result of Israeli military action. Instead, Hagari referred back to a statement he made in June, when he had said the “the hostages were killed while our forces were operating in Khan Younis.” The deaths have renewed urgency for a ceasefire among the protesters in Tel Aviv on Thursday. Omer, 46, who was at the protest with his two daughters, said that he believed the six hostages “could have been saved a lot earlier.” He accused the Israeli government of repeatedly stalling on inking a deal with Hamas, which he warned would only led to Israel paying a higher price for an agreement that could have been secured earlier. A ceasefire would also bring relief to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in the besieged enclave as Israel forges ahead with its military operation. The United Nations [estimated in July](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html) that up to 1.9 million people in the strip have been displaced, almost the entire population of Gaza. But there is skepticism about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s willingness to strike a deal given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. The Israeli prime minister’s political future largely depends on his far right coalition partners – several of whom have already [threatened to leave the government](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/02/middleeast/israeli-ministers-biden-ceasefire-plan-intl/index.html) and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal. “Maybe Hamas kidnapped them (the hostages), but the one we can accuse of murdering them is Benjamin Netanyahu,” Omer said, adding that the prime minister is “the only one responsible.” A group representing the families of Israeli hostages, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said in a Thursday statement that the forensic tests that found gunshot wounds amounted to “further proof of the cruelty of the terrorists” who held them in captivity. The Forum also reiterated criticism of Israeli authorities, saying that the recovery of bodies “is no achievement.” “It is a testimony of the complete failure to reach a deal in time, as six hostages who were supposed to return alive have returned in coffins,” the Forum said. The recovered bodies were identified by Israeli officials on Tuesday as belonging to Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell and Yagev Buchshtab. All but Munder had been announced dead in recent months by the Israeli military. Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the IDF and ISA had entered Hamas tunnels in a “complex operation” to retrieve their bodies. Munder was taken along with his wife, daughter and grandson, who were later freed during a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas in November. Munder’s son, Roee, was killed during the attack. Nine-year-old Ohad Munder told Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11 on Tuesday that the death of his grandfather and the other hostages “shouldn’t have happened.” “There have already been many times when there were negotiations for (a) deal… and then they say no – and in the end they don’t want it, and always regret it at the last minute. All the hostages could have returned alive even on the first day. They could have brought back grandfather and all the other hostages,” Ohad said. There are currently 109 Israeli hostages that remain in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli Government Press Office.

    "title": "Typhoon Kong-rey Hits Shanghai: Record Rainfall and Strong Winds Cause Disruptions",
    "text": "Typhoon Kong-rey has finally begun to diminish in intensity across Shanghai after unleashing relentless torrential rains and fierce winds that approached 100 kilometers per hour for a harrowing 24-hour period.\nThe tropical cyclone made its impact felt in Shanghai on Thursday afternoon, delivering an unprecedented deluge that marked the highest rainfall ever recorded in the city during this time of year. More than ten local weather stations reported extraordinary amounts of rainfall, with several measuring over 80 millimeters in a single day—this figure set a new record for November precipitation.\nIn response to the unprecedented weather, the Shanghai Meteorological Service issued its second-highest rainstorm alert at 10 p.m. on Thursday, signaling serious weather conditions. Concurrently, the Shanghai Flood Control Command elevated the city’s flood and typhoon response efforts to Level II, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.\nAs a precaution, workers in the coastal Fengxian District were evacuated to ensure their safety, and numerous flights and high-speed train services were suspended to mitigate potential chaos. Additionally, several local universities transitioned to online classes to protect students from the inclement weather.\nThe relentless rain persisted overnight and into Friday, with certain districts witnessing extraordinary precipitation totals of up to 132 mm accompanied by gusty winds reaching 95 kph. Fortunately, despite the severe weather conditions, officials reported no major flooding incidents or casualties, and the city has already taken steps to downgrade its rainfall alert.\nThis year, China’s typhoon season has displayed an unusual pattern of being both late and intensely active. So far, four typhoons have made landfall across the nation, nearly double the historical average for this timeframe. Typically, the storm season peaks in July, but unpredictable weather has characterized 2024, highlighted by back-to-back typhoon strikes on Shanghai in September.\nExperts attribute these unusual weather patterns to various factors, including notably higher sea temperatures this year.\nTyphoon Kong-rey also made landfall in Taiwan on Thursday afternoon, marking it as the third-strongest typhoon to hit the island in October since 1951. Tragically, as of Friday, three fatalities have been reported on the island, underscoring the cyclone’s impact.\nLooking ahead, Shanghai’s weather is expected to stabilize this weekend, bringing mostly cloudy skies accompanied by light winds. Furthermore, a new cold front is anticipated to sweep through next week, potentially causing temperatures in downtown areas to plummet to lows of 12 degrees Celsius.\n(Header image: A mother and a daughter on their way home as Typhoon Kong-rey swept through Shanghai, Nov. 1, 2024. Wu Huiyuan/Sixth Tone)\n**Interview with Dr. ⁢Li ⁣Zhang, Meteorologist and Climate Expert**\n**Editor:** Thank you for joining us today, Dr. Zhang. ‍Can you start by giving us a brief overview of Typhoon Kong-rey’s impact on Shanghai?\n**Dr. Zhang:** Certainly! Typhoon Kong-rey was‍ a⁢ remarkable and intense tropical cyclone that struck Shanghai, bringing with it unprecedented rainfall and fierce ⁢winds.‌ Over a 24-hour period, we recorded ⁤wind speeds nearing 100 kilometers‍ per hour, and the city saw remarkable rainfall amounts, with some ⁣weather stations measuring over 80⁢ millimeters in just ⁢one day. ‌This rainfall set a new record for November‌ precipitation ‍in Shanghai.\n**Editor:** That sounds incredibly severe. ‌What led to the decision⁢ by the⁤ Shanghai Meteorological Service to ​issue a rainstorm alert?\n**Dr. Zhang:** ‍The decision to⁤ issue a second-highest​ rainstorm ‌alert was based on the rapid⁢ and severe nature of ⁤the weather conditions. ​The continuous ‌heavy rainfall not only posed risks of​ flooding but also highlighted⁤ the potential⁢ for significant ⁣infrastructure damage. By raising the alert, the authorities aimed to prepare residents and‌ services for the impending dangers.\n**Editor:** Can ‍you explain⁣ what the ⁢Level II response from the Shanghai Flood Control Command‌ entails?\n**Dr. Zhang:** Level II‍ response ⁣indicates‌ a serious weather‍ situation requiring immediate action.‌ This includes the mobilization of ⁤emergency services ⁣and flood ⁣control measures, ‌as well as the evacuation of‌ at-risk areas,​ such as in Fengxian District. It⁤ also involves suspending public transport—including flights ⁣and train services—to ensure public safety ​and minimize risks during such extreme weather events.\n**Editor:** How have ⁣residents ⁤been coping with Typhoon Kong-rey’s aftermath?\n**Dr. Zhang:** Many residents have faced challenges, particularly with flooding ‌in certain areas. Local authorities ‌have been ‍working tirelessly to manage the situation, clear ⁢debris, and provide assistance to those affected. Community ​spirit⁤ is essential‌ during such times, and reports indicate that people are helping each other with relief efforts and⁤ staying informed through official channels.\n**Editor:** Given the increasing frequency and intensity of ⁤storms like Kong-rey, what long-term measures should cities like Shanghai consider?\n**Dr.​ Zhang:** There’s a critical need for enhanced urban planning‌ and improved infrastructure⁢ resilience to⁤ cope with extreme weather‌ events. This includes investing in better drainage systems, creating green spaces that can absorb excess rainfall, ​and implementing⁤ more robust ‌emergency response⁣ frameworks. Additionally,​ community education ⁢on disaster preparedness ⁣plays a crucial role in helping residents stay safe during such events.\n**Editor:** ‌Thank⁣ you, Dr. Zhang, for your insights. It’s ⁣been a pleasure speaking with ⁣you.\n**Dr. Zhang:** Thank⁤ you for having me.​ Stay safe and informed!",

    "title": "Garden expert explains 'sacrificial' plant that keeps pests at bay and helps pollinators: 'An absolute must-grow'",
    "text": "Spring has arrived in many places in the Northern Hemisphere, bringing excitement about summer gardens. One gardening expert took to TikTok to extol the virtues of her favorite plant.\nThe scoop Nasturtium is an easy-to-grow plant that puts out beautiful, edible flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red.\nTiktoker and expert gardener Bailey Van Tassel (bailey.vantassel) shared the three reasons she uses these amazing plants in her garden. In the clip , she says she loves the plant so much, \"it's growing in five places in my garden right now.\"\n@bailey.vantassel Three reasons that you must grow nasturtium. #organicgardening #vegetablegarden #kitchengarden ♬ original sound - Bailey Van Tassel The first reason for the plant, she tells viewers, is as a \"trap plant, the sacrificial lamb of the garden, aphids love nasturtium.\"\nAphids can be an issue for many gardeners, these bugs multiply quickly, and according to The Old Farmer's Almanac , \"feed by sucking the nutrient-rich liquids out of plants.\" Losing nutrients makes it hard for plants to grow and put out fruit. Planting a favorite food of these pesky bugs can protect your harvest.\nNext, Bailey tells us, \"the second reason is obvious: pollinators , they bring them in.\" Pollinators are essential to get fruit and veggies from your garden. These beneficial insects fly around helping to fertilize your plants, leading to the production of fruit and seeds.\nWatch now: What's the true environmental impact of renewable energy? The final reason nasturtiums are a hero in the garden is, that \"every single part of this plant is edible — the petals on the flower, the leaves are edible, the seeds are even edible.\"\nThe leaves and flowers can be eaten as part of a salad or a garnish. Forager Chef says that the seeds can be pickled and turned into an alternative to capers. For all these reasons, Bailey calls them \"an absolute must-grow.\"\nHow it's helping Gardening is one of the best ways to get in touch with nature regularly. People who garden are reportedly happier and get more fiber in their diets.\nIf you have access to a yard or garden plot you can save hundreds of dollars a year growing your own food. If you only have space to grow a few things on your fire escape or your kitchen counter, you can grow things like herbs, saving you money and helping you level up your cooking.\nUnfortunately, in the United States, our mass-produced food system is quite wasteful. Around 40% of the food produced in the U.S. ends up in landfills. Many grocery store chains have been working toward zero waste , with some stores working with food banks to feed those in need rather than tossing perfectly good food.\nGrowing food at home can reduce your trips to the grocery store — and our reliance on this wasteful system.\nWhat everyone's saying Gardeners in the comments were excited about nasturtiums. One person wrote, \"nasturtiums, got it. you sold me at aphids sacrificial lamb, thank you!\"\nAnother commenter said: \"I grew them last year & they were so big by the end of the season. Thanks for reminding me to plant them again!\"\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more , waste less , and help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "title": "Urgent Steps Needed To Stem Bangladesh's Return To Dictatorship And Communalism",
    "text": "( MENAFN - NewsIn) By K\nColombo, August 8: The newly appointed Chief Advisor to the Interim government of Bangladesh, Nobel Laureate Dr Yunus, has called for an end to the violence and vandalism that are continuing even after the flight of the despised dictator sheikh Hasina.\nPresident Mohammad Shahabuddin has asked policemen who had left their posts fearing violent retribution, to return to their posts in 24 hours. In the absence of the police, university students are directing traffic on roads and have formed committees to protect the lives and properties of the Hindus including their temples that were being targeted allegedly by the supporters of the Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).\nADVERTISEMENT The government of India, which is particularly concerned about the safety of the Hindu minority, has not taken a hostile stand and is hoping that the new regime will protect the minorities. But the same\ncannot be said about sections of the Indian media which are using the current spurt in attacks on Hindus to sharpen anti-Muslim feelings in India and\nbenefit from it politically.\nThis stand would not only add fuel to the communal fire in Bangladesh, but create tension between New Delhi and Dhaka putting India's huge investments in Bangladesh in jeopardy.\nYunus' Plea\nOn arrival from Paris after accepting the post of Chief Advisor to the Interim Government, Dr. Muhammad Yunus said:“Let us not let this victory slip away because of our mistakes. I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence. I appeal to all students, members of all political parties and non-political people to stay calm. This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities. We must protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future generations.”\n“Our youth is ready to give this leadership in creating a new world. Let us not miss the chance by going into any senseless violence. Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country.”\n“If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed. Please stay calm. Help those around you to stay calm.”\n“Let us make the best use of our new victory. Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes.”\nRights Groups Plea\nRights groups, eminent citizens and socio-cultural organisations have demanded immediate steps to protect the religious minorities and bring the assailants to justice, describing the attacks on Hindu homes, businesses and temples as an“evil attempt to destroy communal harmony”.\nA statement by 29 eminent citizens said they received reports of attacks on Hindus in at least 35 districts, including Khulna, Jashore, Satkhira, Jhenaidah, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Narail, Munshiganj, Noakhali, Meherpur and Dhaka.\nAhmadiyya people in Panchagarh and Rangpur, ethnic minorities in Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Naogaon, Chapainawabganj and Patuakhali, and Hijra community people in Jamalpur also came under attack, the statement pointed out.\nAccording to The Daily Star, the signatories of the statement include Sultana Kamal, Hameeda Hossain, Khushi Kabir, Rasheda K Choudhury, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, ZI Khan Panna, Saleem Samad, Shahnaz Huda, Shireen Huq, Kajal Debnath, Tabarak Hussain, Subrata Chowdhury, Sumaiya Khair, Faustina Pereira, and Shamsul Huda.\nAt a rally under the banner of“Pratibadi Samajik-Sangskritik Sangathan” 31 organizations condemned the destruction of sculptures. Mofizur Rahman Laltu, general secretary of Bibartan Sangskritik Kendra, called upon everyone to unite to resist the attacks, while Zakir Hossain, president of Gono Sangskritik Kendra, described the miscreants as“agents of fascism”.\nAmit Ranjan Dey, general secretary of Bangladesh Udichi Shilpigoshthi, read out a declaration on behalf of the 31 cultural and social organisations, presenting their vision for the type of government they want in the country.\nDipok Suman, chief of Tirandaz Natya Dal, and poet Hasan Fakir recited poetry at the event. Charan Sangskritik Kendra, Udichi Shilpigoshthi, Democrazy Clowns, and Bibartan Sangskritik Dal sang songs on communal harmony.\nThe Workers' Party of Bangladesh criticised the army chief for not playing a visible role in maintaining law and order even after promising to protect people.\n“Temples are being attacked, vandalized and looted,” Nahid Islam, a top leader of the students movement said in a statement on Tuesday, blaming the attacks on those who want to“destroy” the student movement.\nMeenakshi Ganguly, the deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, described the reports of violence against Hindus as“extremely concerning.”\nTensions between Muslims and Hindus in Bangladesh have boiled over in the past, including violent clashes across the country in 2021. But compared to the rule of the BNP and the military, Sheikh Hasina's had ensured greater peace for the minority Hindus. She had filled many high places in the police with Hindus to instil confidence in them.\nHindus were 10.7% of the Bangladeshi population in 2015.\nLessons from Arab Spring\nThe aftermath of the pro-democracy“Arab Spring” movement should teach Bangladeshis that it is of the utmost urgency to restore order and sanity after a revolution, if the country is not to return to dictatorship.\nThe Arab Spring mass agitation overthrew Tunisia's Ben Ali and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, with just one slogan“Bring Down the Regime”. The movement brought out the pent-up frustrations and socio-economic grievances of the masses, the youth, the middle and lower classes, over the inequality and injustice fostered by corrupt dictatorships.\nWriting on the subject in The Daily Star Ramisa Rob says:“Though the Arab Spring led to the fall of seemingly invincible leaders-like Sheikh Hasina seemed a week ago-the victory was short-lived in most countries, as the downfall of the reviled regimes instead led to further turmoil. Libya and Syria collapsed into civil war. Egypt witnessed a military coup followed by the rise of a leader even worse than the one they got rid of.”\nTherefore, understanding the underlying reasons for the failure of the Arab Spring nations to transition to democratic regimes is crucial as Bangladesh navigates uncharted waters of a seismic regime change, unlike any before, Rob adds.\nThe incoming interim government should serve longer than previous ones in Bangladesh's history, in order to strategically start rebuilding the nation before groups with vested interests hijack the political vacuum, she recommends.\nEconomic Reform\nRob points out to Anand Gopal's analysis of the failure of the Arab Spring movement and says that the post-Arab Spring rulers had failed to change the neoliberal economic policies of the old regimes. The masses who continued to be frustrated tuned to communalism and intolerance.\nTherefore, if the political economy of Bangladesh remains the same and justice to the masses is not rendered, there will be anomie, or societal normlessness, and senseless aggression against State structures and also sitting ducks like the minorities will take place.\nTo control disorder, a dictatorial ruler might come up, as it happened in Egypt, negating the aims of Arab Spring.\nTherefore, the Bangladeshi revolution has to be followed by concrete steps to build structures and policies to render justice and equality.\n“Democracy is an umbrella idea for free speech and free and fair elections. But without addressing deeply unequal systems-which is what triggered Hasina's fall-will lead us down the same path as the Arab nations that went backwards despite a world-changing moment,” Rob warns.\nCiting Egypt's example she says:“During Egypt's uprisings against three-decade ruler Mubarak, minority Orthodox Coptic Christians thought the discrimination would end after the revolution, but it escalated instead. Five years later, as current President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi took office overthrowing an Islamist regime, the violence and divisions between Muslims and Christians have continued to intensify, along with socioeconomic disparity.”\nBangladesh is predominantly a secular country, and its very strength lies in that fact. The student coordinators have insofar stepped into protecting minorities, and minority places of worship. To retain and expand unity of all communities in Bangladesh, the interim government and the Bangladeshi community as a whole, have to work towards changing the existing social contracts which disproportionately affect marginalised people of all religions,” Rob recommends.\nRole of India\nIndia and the Indian polity as a whole have a huge role to play in seeing that sanity returns to Bangladesh and its basic issues of poverty, inequality and democracy are addressed to ensure stability and a lasting democracy.\nThe tendency to drum up the issue of attacks on the Hindu minority, and play up the danger emanating from the Jamaat-e-Islami and other non-secular forces in Bangladesh could do more harm than good.\nIt is bound to exacerbate communal disharmony not only in Bangladesh but in India too, unleashing forces which hope to gain local political advantage from communal polarization in both countries.\nSections of the Delhi-based media, are constantly running programs and discussions to bring out and amplify anti-Hindu sentiments in Bangladesh only to whip anti-Muslim sentiments in India.\nThe idea is also to set New Delhi against Dhaka and destroy five decades of friendship carefully nurtured by successive regimes under difficult circumstances, with nary a thought for the fate of billions of dollars of Indian investment in Bangladesh.\nEND\nMENAFN08082024000191011043ID1108533460",
