    "text": "- Plus Tunisie : le président Saïed réitère son attachement à la souveraineté de son pays et le refus de l'ingérence étrangère Le président tunisien Kaïs Saïed, a réitéré son attachement à la souveraineté territoriale, politique et économique de son pays et son refus catégorique de toute ingérence étrangère dans les affaires intérieures de la Tunisie. M. Saïed a insisté sur le fait que la Banque centrale de Tunisie (BCT) et son gouverneur \"devaient prendre les mesures nécessaires au sein du comité d'analyse financière afin de surveiller les sources de financement provenant de l'étranger envers les associations\", a-t-on appris d'un communiqué publié tard dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi, cité par ses services. Ces propos ont été énoncés en marge d'une réunion du président avec le chef du gouvernement, Ahmed Hachani, accompagné de Leïla Jaffel, ministre de la Justice, de Sihem Boughdiri Namsia, ministre des Finances et de Fathi Zouhair Nouri, gouverneur de la BCT. M. Saïed a, en ce sens, pointé du doigt certains financements provenant de l'étranger, précisément \"émanant de cercles suspects\", selon le palais présidentiel de Carthage. \"Le peuple tunisien ne tolère (une quelconque) ingérence étrangère dans ses affaires intérieures (que ce) soit une ingérence explicite ou encore camouflée\", a dit le chef d'Etat tunisien.",

    "text": "[FILE PHOTO] Photo courtesy of DMW Kimberly Anne Ojeda Published on: 17 Jul 2025, 04:56\nCopied\nAuthorities have yet to confirm which of the 13 missing Filipino seafarers from the Houthi-attacked MV Eternity C are among the casualties or survivors.\nIn a press conference Wednesday night at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1, Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) Secretary Hans Cacdac said they are aware of international media reports citing three to five possible fatalities. However, he emphasized that the Philippine government is not rushing to draw conclusions.\n“We are still in the process of verifying who among the crew are alive and who may be among the casualties,” Cacdac said, noting the sensitivity of the situation due to a recent statement from the Houthi militants.\n“We all know that the Houthis have made a statement that they’re holding several of the seafarers, so we have to regard the security aspect of this matter,” he added.\nCacdac clarified that search and rescue efforts have not been officially called off. He explained that rescue boats that initially assisted the eight rescued Filipino seafarers had to withdraw after Houthi forces surrounded the area.\n\"We are still working with the ship owner in terms of how to account for the others. And we all know as well that the ship owner sent a signal to the passing ships to also look around and observe the surroundings,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs Eduardo de Vega said the Omani Foreign Minister is ready to extend help.\nHe also confirmed that the DFA is coordinating with a Yemeni honorary consul who has links to the Houthi group.\n“We’re also asking him to reach out because there are reports that the Houthis may be holding some of the crew. Let’s wait for his confirmation. Remember, if it turns out the Houthis are indeed holding them, at least we know they’re alive,” De Vega said.\nCacdac assured that the DMW remains in close contact with the families of the 13 unaccounted seafarers. This was affirmed by a relative of one missing crew member from the MIMAROPA region, who requested anonymity.",

    "title": "COLUMN: America needs a return to the real Black History Month",
    "text": "I miss Black History Month. Ever since 2020, when George Floyd’s murder plunged us into America’s “racial reckoning” — the real Black History Month has been missing in action.\nAround the turn into the 20th century, Booker T. Washington, founder of Tuskegee University, said, “You go to school, you study about the Germans and the French, but not about your own race. I hope the time will come when you study Black history, too”. It feels like that time is past.\nFor in 2024, we only study Marxist tropes pretending to be about Black history. Gone is the inspiring narrative of Americans (some of African lineage) overcoming all attempts to steal their dignity. Absent are the studies of the inventors, the poets, and the leaders that used to fill our awareness with the power of American exceptionalism.\nThurgood Marshall, the first American Supreme Court Justice of African descent once told us, “In recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the highest tribute.” This is what Black History Month used to be.\nSomeone please … return me to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial so that I might watch in wonder as Marian Anderson (the famous classical contralto) sings “My County Tis of Thee.” Show me the woman whose talent delighted, even while rebuking racial tyranny.\nI miss the days of civil protest wrapped in artistic valor.\nSomeone please … take me to observe George Washington Carver’s genius. We can both admire as he discovers over 300 uses of peanuts, including shaving cream, wood stains, and even plastics. I would love to hear a lecture about those thousands of experiments.\nCan we read (or re-read) “The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass?” In 2024, America needs this story. Let’s travel with a man who escaped slavery becoming a social reformer who was the most important civil rights leader of the 19th century. His example should be followed by the social reformers of today.\nSomeone please … dig out the photographs of a Black community that was 70% married – with Black fathers in the home. Show me again, the people unified singing “We Shall Overcome” while daring to do exactly that from 1945 to 1970. Let’s remember, beautifully attired African Americans standing strong against the tyranny of Jim Crow.\nWithout riots, until they won.\nThese stories are what we used to hear during Black History Month. In the reflection of these heroes and heroines of liberty, we knew that racism (while toxic) was not all powerful.\nWhere is the real Black History Month? I fear that Marxist gaslighting has replaced it.\nI am emotionally exhausted from the ridiculous deification of criminals like George Floyd, other addicts and gang members that has replaced Black history. We must fight daily to refuse the toxic narratives of media — that in enmity to the Black community — work to convince us that our story is one of oppression and failure. This despite the clear and present work of Black citizens that dared to go from 100% poverty in the 1800s to 18% in 2018.\nWhile growing by the tens of millions. In 2024, Black America has more in the middle class than were alive in 1960. This is a triumph, not a tragedy.\nIn this 2024 twisted version of Black History Month, Black Colorado lawmakers side against sexually traumatized Black children. Black legislators prioritize the rights of sexual predators over those hurt.\nIn these recent and poisonous lawmaking stories, the criminals (especially Black ones) are the victims in need of our help. In this strange new Black History Month, Black victims of crime are silenced. Marxist storytelling lifts the experience of the drug dealers, criminals and addicts who aren’t finished destroying the neighborhoods that they reside in.\nColorado government focuses resources on those who commit crimes, refusing to help sheriffs, and stopping prosecutors from effective law enforcement. But no one is allowed to ask questions without being ridiculed, intimidated or marginalized.\nSocieties that prioritize criminal behavior and rights are on the edge of ruin. As are we.\nW.E.B. Du Bois was right when he said, “The cost of liberty is less than the price of repression.” The repression of real Black History in Colorado is to be reviled and must be stopped. For in 2024, we are writing it.\nBlack does not = criminal. Nor Marxist. The law-abiding citizens must be upheld in a shared history of how we made our state safe again.\nFollow author Maya Angelou and advocate for history. “Won’t it be wonderful when Black history and Native American history and Jewish history and all of U.S. history is taught from one book. Just U.S. history.”\nAnd history should lift the narratives and behavior of those who build our state — not destroy it.\nRachel Stovall is an event manager, entertainer and community advocate.",

    "text": "Bockel expressed France's admiration for Chad's transition to civilian rule and confirmed that his country's forces will remain there (French) Jean-Marie Boucle, French President Emmanuel Macron's envoy to Africa, announced that Paris will keep its forces in Chad, which is ruled by a military junta, after African countries expelled French forces from it. France's influence in its former colonies in West Africa declined after the new regimes in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger expelled its forces from their territories. About a thousand French soldiers are stationed in Chad, which has been ruled by General Mohamed Idriss Deby since 2021, and is one of France's few allies in Africa currently. Bockel, who is also charged with discussing the new French military deployment on the continent, said, “Of course we will stay” in Chad. Bokle added - after his meeting with Déby in N'Djamena - that Macron requested talks with the Chadian authorities regarding the \"evolution\" of the French military deployment to \"better adapt it\" to regional security and military challenges. Bokle pointed out that he also expressed to Deby France's \"admiration\" for Chad's transition to civilian rule, a process that began after the head of the military junta took power to succeed his father, who was killed after ruling the country for more than three decades with an iron fist. Déby will run in the presidential elections scheduled for May 6, which he will almost certainly win, with major opposition figures exiled, co-opted, or killed. Deby's main rival, his cousin Yaya Dilo Djiro, was killed last week in an incident that Dilo's party described as an \"execution\", while the government said that Dilo violently resisted arrest during an exchange of fire with soldiers. Déby (39 years old) initially pledged to return power to civilians within 18 months, but postponed the date for another two years. He had also previously stated that he would not run in the elections. Source: French",

Su salida se dio a las 07:17 luego de la entonación del Himno Nacional. Desde antes de las 05:00, los fieles se aglomeraron en los alrededores del templo, situado en Lizardo García y la A. Allí hicieron vigilia para después de la salida de la imagen acompañar la romería con imágenes, cuadros, rosarios, velas, entre otros artículos. Publicidad Esta romería de Viernes Santo se desarrolla en medio del vigente estado de excepción y conflicto interno armado. Esta vez, en la previa del acto, se limitó el paso peatonal sobre la puerta principal del templo y una calle paralela a Lizardo García. Se ubicaron cercos de uniformados y rejas móviles. Por ello, los fieles se debieron acomodar en la calle A. Alrededor de 677 policías acompañan esta romería para salvaguardar la seguridad de los presentes y para mantener el orden de la procesión, la más grande del país por el nivel de concurrencia. Publicidad #ViernesSanto Procesión del Cristo del Consuelo de inicia en el templo, ubicado en el sector de Lizardo García y la A, en el suroeste.Publicado por [El Universo]en Viernes, 29 de marzo de 2024 El arzobispo de Guayaquil, Luis Cabrera, y otros religiosos se ubicaron junto a la imagen para acompañarla en el recorrido.

Publicidad En la parte inicial, Cabrera dio un mensaje de paz y unión hacia los feligreses. Con el avance del paso de la imagen, fieles se ubicaron en ciertas esquinas para aplaudir al Cristo. Muchos alzaban sus imágenes, rosarios y velas a la espera de recibir ese favor o agradecer lo recibido. “¡Qué viva la iglesia Católica! ¡Qué vivan los militares!”, gritaban varios fieles en el traslado. En tanto, agentes de la Agencia de Tránsito y Movilidad se desplegaron en calles paralelas para desviar el tráfico por vías aledañas ya que la procesión tiene como ruta la calle A, desde Lizardo García hasta cruzar el puente de la A y llegar al Cisne.

    "title": "Ram Temple Consecration Event: IUML accuses BJP of using Ram Temple consecration event for political purposes | India News - Times of India",
    "text": "MALAPPURAM: The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a key ally of the Congress-led UDF in Kerala, accused the BJP on Friday of exploiting the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya for political purposes. The IUML expressed hope that secular forces would recognise this political manoeuvre of the BJP. Amid increasing uncertainty in the Congress's Kerala state unit on the political stance the party should take regarding the invitation to its national leadership for the Ram Temple consecration ceremony on January 22, the IUML urged the Congress to take an independent decision. \\\"The BJP is treating it as a political inauguration for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The prime minister and others have launched a political propaganda aimed at the next parliamentary election,\\\" IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty told reporters after the party's political affairs committee meeting. Alleging that the saffron party is politicising the event by differentiating between those who participate in it and those who don't, Kunhalikutty said, \\\"The BJP government's target is the next parliamentary elections. The League highly respects the faith and freedom of worship of the Hindu community. No comment on that. But the opening of the Ram temple is being used politically.\\\" He said the issue is political, not religious, and called on every political party, especially those with secular views, to realise this and take independent decisions. On the Congress's stand, Kunhalikutty said, \\\"Congress has its own set up, leadership. They are facing a lot of problems. Let them take an independent decision.\\\" IUML supremo Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal added that the IUML supports the faithful on the issue but cannot accept the attempt to turn it into a political agenda for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The IUML's statement is seen as an attempt to exert pressure on the Congress's state unit, which is in a difficult position regarding the invitation extended to its national leaders for the consecration ceremony next month. The ruling CPI(M) in the state has already declared that its representatives will not attend the ceremony, considering it a political move by the BJP ahead of the general elections that are to be held in a few months.",
