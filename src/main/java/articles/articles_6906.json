    "title": "Fatal abuse of Myanmar maid: 10 years' jail for cop who abetted wife in starving maid and removed evidence - CNA",
    "text": "SINGAPORE: A police officer was sentenced to 10 years' jail on Thursday (Jul 17) for his role in the fatal abuse of a young maid from Myanmar by his ex-wife and former mother-in-law.\nStaff Sergeant Kevin Chelvam, who has been suspended from the Singapore Police Force, was earlier convicted at trial in the case involving Ms Piang Ngaih Don, who died on Jul 26, 2016 after months of physical abuse.\nThe 24-year-old victim died of brain injury with severe blunt trauma to her neck, and weighed just 24kg at the time of her death.\nChelvam, 46, was convicted on a total of four charges.\nHe was found guilty of one count of voluntarily causing hurt by grabbing the maid's hair and lifting her body off the ground, and one count of abetting his then-wife Gaiyathiri Murugayan to voluntarily cause grievous hurt by starving her.\nHe was also convicted of one count of giving false information to a police officer handling the case, and one count of causing evidence to disappear by dismantling a closed-circuit television (CCTV) recorder installed in his flat.\nThe prosecution urged District Judge Teoh Ai Lin to jail Chelvam for 11 to 12 years, saying that this would speak to the harms caused to Ms Piang Ngaih Don and \"the outrage felt by the community\".\nThe defence asked the judge for compassion and said Chelvam was leaving the sentence in the court's hands.\nJudge Teoh noted that Chelvam knew the maid was not being given enough to eat in the 35 days before her death. \"He had time and opportunity to stop the abuse but he did not,\" she said.\n\"He was her legal employer who was to ensure a safe working environment for her, and should and could have stopped the abuse,\" she later added.\nOn Chelvam's removal of evidence, the judge said: \"If the CCTV recorder had not been recovered, Don would have taken with her to the grave the whole truth of what she had endured in the final days of her tragic life.\"\nChelvam was allowed to start serving his sentence in two weeks after an increase in bail. He had requested to spend time with his children.\nAt the prosecution's request, he was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on a fifth charge of using criminal force against Ms Piang Ngaih Don by hitting her shoulder with a toy bat.\nChelvam's ex-wife Gaiyathiri and her mother, Prema S Naraynasamy, are currently serving 30 years and 17 years in jail respectively for their roles in the case.\nKevin Chelvam arrives at the State Courts on Jul 17, 2025. (Photo: CNA/Ili Mansor) ARGUMENTS BY PROSECUTION AND DEFENCE Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Teh said Chelvam was complicit in the abuse, arguing against the defence's position that he had no active participation in or control over the abuse dealt out by his then-wife and mother-in-law.\nReferring to the judge's findings at trial, Mr Teh said that Chelvam stood by during the abuse, that he knew Gayathiri and Prema repeatedly and regularly abused the maid, and that he knew she was in a weakened and tired state.\nAs Ms Piang Ngaih Don's legal employer, he had \"every opportunity\" to stop the abuse but did not, said the prosecutor.\nChelvam even \"actively endorsed\" the withholding of food from Ms Piang Ngaih Don as punishment. Her severe malnourishment contributed to her inability to withstand the assaults to her neck, which led to her death, said Mr Teh.\nAs a police officer, Chelvam was also fully aware of the significant evidence held in the CCTV recorder that he removed, said the prosecutor.\nThis recorder was eventually recovered. All the abuse charges against the three offenders, including Gayathiri's offence of culpable homicide, stemmed from the footage, said Mr Teh.\nIn mitigation, defence lawyer Pratap Kishan said that his client had \"lost nine years of his life\" while the case was ongoing.\nChelvam was not in remand and was \"out and about\" during that period but \"his life has come to a standstill\", said Mr Kishan.\nThe lawyer also pointed to a character reference the suspended cop received from the Traffic Police, which said that he was a positive worker and an asset to the unit during his service.\nDeliberating on the prosecution's proposed sentence, Judge Teoh said she disagreed with the level of harm ascribed to Chelvam's act of pulling Ms Piang Ngaih Don's hair and lifting her off the ground.\nShe said Chelvam was not an active perpetuator of the sustained pattern of maid abuse, and it was not appropriate to ascribe to him the same levels of culpability and harm for that act as the abuse by Gayathiri and Prema.\nFATAL ABUSE Chelvam lived with Gaiyathiri and their two children – then aged four and one – in a three-bedroom flat in Bishan. Two tenants lived in one of the bedrooms, said the prosecution.\nPrema had her own home but would often stay over to help cook and take care of the children. When she stayed over, she would share a room with Ms Piang Ngaih Don, who slept on the floor.\nMs Piang Ngaih Don began working for Chelvam's family on a two-year contract in late May 2015. It was her first time working outside of Myanmar.\nAlthough Chelvam was her registered employer, Gaiyathiri was the one responsible for supervising her and for her welfare on a daily basis.\nMs Piang Ngaih Don agreed to Gaiyathiri's conditions of employment, which were that she should not have a handphone or any off days, with the understanding that Gaiyathiri would pay her more and let her rest at home.\nChelvam signed the employment contract, agreeing to provide the maid with at least three adequate meals a day, among other terms.\nAt the beginning, when Gaiyathiri was upset with Ms Piang Ngaih Don, she would shout at her and scold her. This escalated to physical abuse by Gaiyathiri from October 2015.\nAround May 2016, Prema became aware of the physical abuse by Gaiyathiri and started physically abusing Ms Piang Ngaih Don too.\nThe maid was not given adequate food and rest by Gaiyathiri and was only allowed to sleep for about five hours a night.\nPrema was aware of this and had noticed that Ms Piang Ngaih Don was losing a lot of weight.\nMs Piang Ngaih Don also had to shower and relieve herself with the toilet door open while Gaiyathiri or Prema watched.\nShe wore multiple layers of face masks as she went about her work in the house as Gaiyathiri found her \"unhygienic\" and did not want to look at her face.\nFor 11 consecutive nights from Jul 15, 2016, Gaiyathiri used a string to tie one of Ms Piang Ngaih Don's hands to a window grille in her bedroom while she slept on the floor.\nThis was purportedly to prevent her from leaving the room at night.\nREMOVAL OF EVIDENCE A CCTV system was installed in the flat, with cameras placed in various parts of the unit, to monitor Ms Piang Ngaih Don and the children. During investigations, police seized 35 days' worth of footage from Jun 21, 2016 to Jul 26, 2016.\nThe footage captured the abuse and ill-treatment that Ms Piang Ngaih Don suffered in the days leading to her death.\nIt showed that Prema stayed over at the house on at least seven out of the 11 nights.\nIt also showed that, on numerous occasions, Chelvam was at home while the victim was being berated and beaten and that this often took place right in front of him.\nVideo clips of footage played in court showed five incidents of Chelvam standing by in the kitchen while Ms Piang Ngaih Don was being assaulted by Gaiyathiri inside the toilet or in the kitchen.\nAfter Ms Piang Ngaih Don died, Chelvam attempted to thwart investigations by preventing the police from obtaining crucial footage by disconnecting the CCTV system's recorder and lying about its whereabouts.\nChelvam lied to the police that the recorder had been removed six months earlier at a tenant's request as they were \"uncomfortable\" with it.\nWhile he was at the house with the police on the day Ms Piang Ngaih Don's death was discovered, Chelvam also pretended to search the house for the recorder, before claiming he was not able to find it.\nSource: CNA/dv(zl) Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Related Topics court crime abuse Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...

    "text": "This is the trick that one needs to follow to beat the summer heat while saving some extra bucks on energy bills. Electricity bills can sometimes get outrageous and burn a hole in our wallets. Especially [during the summer](https://scoop.upworthy.com/summer-camp-staff-walks-out-after-their-offer-letter-terms-were-altered-without-notice), electricity bills soar higher than the temperature. So, Jackson L'Heureux–who goes by [@cheese_jackson45](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7257741595141786922) on TikTok–shared an effective hack to save some bucks on [ towering electric bills](https://scoop.upworthy.com/man-puts-his-foot-down-and-refuses-to-pay-after-being-forced-to-cover-restaurant-bill-for-strangers-644643-644643-644643-644643-644643). The smart approach he disclosed to his audience helped him gain over 182k views on one of his videos. \"With the summer heat at full blast, our bill nearly doubled, so it's time to make some changes,\" L'Heureux states in his [first video.](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7257741595141786922) \"The first thing I did was buy this watt meter to measure the wattages of all our appliances to see where I can make adjustments.\" He held up a white device with a small display, some buttons and a plug point and went on to explain how the device works. L'Heureux plugs in [various electrical appliances](https://scoop.upworthy.com/woman-discovers-shes-been-paying-utility-bills-for-her-entire-apartment-building-since-2021-671033-671033) in his house to check their energy consumption rate with the portable watt meter and he starts with his television. \"I started with our TV setup and found some interesting results,\" he states in the video. \"My 15-year-old TV consumes almost 140 watts, which is crazy. My PS4 consumes about 44 watts while doing light tasks. I also found that when in rest mode, the PS4 consumes about six watts, which is about the same as an LED light bulb.\" To lower the energy consumption of the TV, he adjusted the backlight setting. Following this adjustment, the [TV started](https://scoop.upworthy.com/man-turns-up-at-bbc-for-job-interview-ends-up-being-is-mistakenly-interviewed-on-live-tv-589037-589037-589037-589037-589037-589037-589037) consuming only 90 watts. L'Heureux also made sure to fully shut down his PS4 when he was not using it. [@cheese_jackson45]Follow for part 2! [#fyp] [#electricbill] [#reduce] [#savemoney] [#lifehacks] [#explore] [#trending] [#tiktok] [♬ Electric Avenue - Electric Avenue] In [part two](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7258034801913974059) of the video, he showed more ways to reduce electric bills. L'Heureux tackled the energy consumption issue of the lighting setups in his house. He starts the video by replacing the \"dumb\" LED bulb in a table lamp with a \"smart\" LED bulb, which even changes colors. \"It also consumes about seven watts and can be dimmed to bring that even lower,\" he explained. He then moved onto an LED light strip setup that illuminated the spaces under the cabinets in the kitchen. It can be dimmed down to bring the power consumption from 11 watts to 7.9. [The sunset lamp](https://scoop.upworthy.com/lamp-powered-by-seawater-that-can-shine-for-45-days-with-single-refill-is-helping-coastal-communities), which was placed on the top shelf, consumed 10 watts. \"Since it's USB, I can swap out the power brick and bring it down to 8 watts,\" L'Heureux noted. \"So in total, we went down from 21.6 watts to 15.2 watts,\" he concluded. The viewers on his TikTok page were thrilled to have this information and some even inquired about the watt meter.

    "title": "BBC Question Time Audience Member Blasts Slavery Reparation Demands - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "A heated debate over reparations for slavery erupted during BBC's Question Time, as an audience member dismissed demands for compensation as \"ridiculous.\"The debate aired live from Plymouth this week and part of it focused on whether the UK should allocate funds to atone for its colonial past.Emily Sheffield, a journalist on the panel, said: “I think it’s an incredibly complex question.”She added:“King Charles has said that we must understand the path of history. I do think there is further acknowledgement to be made of the pain, the stain of that terrible period of history that caused so much damage to so many communities.\"Sheffield stressed that the conversation should continue and that reparations should not only focus on money, saying: “Reparations is not just about money, it is about acknowledging what happened.”An audience member was then asked to speak and he wasn't happy with what he heard from the panel.He said: “You’re opening a can of worms. You’re asking the country to be responsible for something that happened 200 years ago, and for me to pay that to someone who wasn’t even there. I find it all ridiculous.”The man argued that it was unfair to hold people accountable for events that happened centuries ago. He said: “Why should I pay for something that happened before I was alive to someone who wasn’t alive then?”Sheffield responded, asking if the audience member acknowledged the importance of discussing the issue.The man replied, saying: “I acknowledge it could help build their businesses, but it sounds like a fine to me.“That’s what it sounds like, and I don’t think you should hold today’s people in contempt for that.”Sheffield also referenced Philip Davis, the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, who said the discussion was not just about money, but “about appreciation of what our ancestors went through.” Checkout latest world news below links : World News || Latest News || U.S. News Source link",
