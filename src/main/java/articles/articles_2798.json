    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "People have been looking forward to Black Ops 6 ‘s Zombies mode ever since it was announced. Warzone Zombies didn’t nearly live up to the expectations that people had hoped for, and this was a chance for the franchise to redeem itself.\nUnfortunately, judging from the public’s reactions to new gameplay clips, Treyarch may have completely dropped the ball on this one.

Full loadout on start. No Thanks. Still in a Warzone style.. BIG NO THANKS.

BIG NO THANKS. Wtf is this @Activision https://t.co/ntXQOf7ExV\n— Gloveaction (@Gloveaction) August 28, 2024 In the replies, it’s clear that this is not what players wanted. Instead of taking after highly liked iterations, such as from the previous Black Ops titles, it seems to adapt from Warzone .\nThe reactions aren’t completely surprising—people were skeptical when it was revealed that Zombies would be moving ahead with Operators instead of crews like in previous games, was already Strike One for many.\nFans Feel Frustrated and Unheard After New Clip Emerges Black Ops 6 Zombies fails to keep fans excited even before its release. | Credit: Activision One of the biggest complaints is the ability to spawn in with a full loadout.

There aren’t many zombies from what the clips show and the environment and sound design don’t do much to push the ‘horror’ part of Zombies .\nThe list of complaints stretches long. The COD Next showcase might’ve gotten fans excited for the game, the reality is a far cry from expectations.\nDo you think the situation is overblown, or do you agree that Black Ops 6 Zombies looks disappointing? We’d love to hear your thoughts on it in the comments below!",

    "text": "Taylor Swift fans find clues tied to Florida ahead of ‘The Tortured Poet’s Department’ release [Samantha Neely](https://www.news-press.com/staff/5884663001/samantha-neely/) [Lianna Norman](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/staff/10117762002/lianna-norman/) Taylor Swift is beloved by her devoted clan of fans for many reasons other than just her music. Miss Americana is known and loved by her fans for the [smart clues she leaves in her outfits, music videos](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/live-blog/taylor-swift-album-tortured-poets-live-updates-rcna147489), Instagram posts and even nail polish colors. These clues, or Easter eggs, point to what the pop star might be working on or planning to do next. And with [a new Taylor Swift album](/story/news/2024/04/17/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-album-preorder-florida/73352702007/) on the way this weekend, Swift's social media accounts have been active and have her fans hunting for Easter eggs. One recent theory places the spotlight on Florida. Here's a quick guide to how Swift drops Easter eggs for her projects and why Swifties think Florida might be the epicenter of her next big announcement, whatever that may be. First, what are 'Easter eggs' and why is Taylor Swift associated with them? What if we told you she's a Mastermind? But seriously, Swift is known for hiding well-placed clues in her songs, promotional messages and even her outfits and nail polish, for fans to uncover and guess what she could be doing next. Taylor herself told [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/10/20/taylor-swift-midnights-easter-eggs/) in 2022, \"When I was 15 and putting together my first album, I decided to encode the lyrics with hidden messages using capital letters. That's how it started, and my fans and I have since descended into color coding, numerology, word searches, elaborate hints, and Easter eggs.\" Here are some examples of her best Easter eggs: - 13 - As her lucky number (born on Dec. 13, 1989), you'll not only spot it in music videos or in her posts but fans have found 13-second intros at the start of her songs or 13 capitalized letters in an Instagram post that lead to a larger clue. - Snakes - Fueled by Kim Kardashian calling her a \"snake,\" Swift has included the imagery for her Reputation album and used the symbol when hinting at her past feuds. - \"Nils Sjoberg\" - In the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video, she is next a grave of Nils Sjoberg. It's the fake name Taylor used while working on ex Calvin Harris and Rihanna's song, \"This Is What You Came For.\" - \"Not a lot going on at the moment\" - Her post in April 2020 seemed to poke fun at the pandemic at the time but really, she was working on two of her albums \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore,\" which released later that year. - The Summer I Turned Pretty - Did you know she actually announced her album \"Midnights\" way before the MTV Music Awards? In a post about Amazon Prime's The Summer I Turned Pretty using her new song, she specifically says it will come out at \"m i d n i g h t.\" Why do fans think Taylor Swift is leaving hints about Florida before album release? There was a globe set up at a Spotify event for Taylor's new album and this TikTok creator (@swiftiesweetheart) pointed out that there was a pin in the globe, placed on Florida. \"I think this globe just revealed everything...\" she said in the TikTok video. She pointed out that there is [a song on the track list for Taylor's new album titled \"Florida!!!\"](/story/news/2024/02/06/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-album-songs-florida-florence-machine-post-malone/72487681007/) Taylor is also known for playing around with numbers and fake error codes on her website. On the night that she announced her new album at the Grammys, her website went black and had an error code up that read \"Error 321 backend fetch failed.\" There was also a massive QR code put up in Chicago, as promotion for her album, that led anyone who scanned it to another \"Error 321\" message in the form of a short video on Taylor's YouTube account. This creator and some other Swifties are theorizing that the \"321\" sequence could be a nod to a Florida area code, as it's an area code for the Orlando area. Think this is a stretch? It's probably one of the most simple Swiftie theories yet. What is 'The Tortured Poet's Department' song 'Florida!!!' about? While there’s no confirmation on what “Florida!!!” is about, fans have taken to social media with their theories. Fans theorize that \"Florida!!!\" is about her Eras Tour shows at Raymond James Stadium from April 13 to 15, 2023 — which would have been when details of Swift and Joe Alwyn, her boyfriend of six years, break up were made public, according to [People](https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-break-up-after-6-years-together/). Since the track list was revealed, fans looked back at moments from the Tampa shows and noticed the popstar seemed upset when performing songs about her past relationship. Who is 'Florence + the Machine' featuring on 'Florida!!!' track? Florence Welch is the powerhouse lead vocalist for the English indie rock band \"Florence + the Machine.\" Welch is known for several hits over the past decade, such as 2009's \"Dog Days are Over,\" 2011's \"Shake it Out\" and 2015's \"Sweet Nothings\" collaboration with Calvin Harris. \"Florida!!!\" is the first time Swift and Welch have collaborated on a song together. See the entire 'The Tortured Poet's Department' track list - \"Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)\" - \"The Tortured Poets Department\" - \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\" - \"Down Bad\" - \"So Long, London\" - \"But Daddy I Love Him\" - \"Fresh Out the Slammer\" - \"Florida!!!\" (feat. Florence + The Machine) - \"Guilty as Sin?\" - \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" - \"I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\" - \"loml\" - \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" - \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" - \"The Alchemy\" - \"Clara Bow\" - Bonus Track: \"The Manuscript\" There are also three different variants that come with a different album cover and bonus track — The Bolter edition, The Albatross edition and The Black Dog edition. ‘Tortured Poet’s Department’ almost here [Here’s where Florida Swifties can find it](/story/news/2024/04/17/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-album-preorder-florida/73352702007/) When does 'The Tortured Poets Department' come out? When can I stream Taylor Swift's new album? After receiving her 13th Grammy, Swift announced her new album [“Tortured Poets Department”](/story/entertainment/music/2024/02/05/taylor-swift-left-fans-easter-eggs-for-tortured-poets-department/72483002007/) would come out Friday, April 19. The album also will be available to stream on most streaming platform, such as [Apple Music and Spotify](https://presave.umusic.com/tsthetorturedpoetsdepartment), on that date.",

    "text": "They are five words that can be worth hundreds of dollars: The lottery and gaming credit. It is applied to a homeowner's annual property taxes, as basically a discount on the total amount due. Catherine Oreto, a Green Bay resident, learned about the credit from a reporter's phone call. \"That's kind of exciting, I would be excited to get $275 back on my taxes,\" Oreto said. The amount of the credit is based on the school district you live in - everyone who lives in a given district gets the same credit. In the Green Bay Area and Howard-Suamico school districts, the credit this year is about $275. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue urged qualifying homeowners to check their property tax bills to make sure the credit was applied. To qualify: -Be a Wisconsin resident -As of 1/1/23, have owned your home and used it as your primary residence. Until January 31, homeowners can apply using this form at the treasurer's office that collects their property taxes. After that, a refund can be requested from the state. The Brown County treasurer's office sent out 8,000 letters this year to homeowners who likely qualified but had not signed up for the credit, said Deputy Brown County Treasurer Chuck Mahlik. About half of the letter recipients signed up for the credit, Mahlik said. Once a homeowner signs up, it is not necessary to sign up again in future years for the same residence.",

    "text": "La Finlande émerge en tant que plaque tournante européenne pour les technologies de la défensePrincipaux renseignements Les entreprises finlandaises contribuent à l’essor du secteur des technologies de défense du pays grâce à des produits innovants. Les technologies de défense sont devenues une opportunité d’investissement intéressante en Finlande en raison de l’évolution du paysage géopolitique. Un écosystème technologique solide et le soutien du gouvernement ont favorisé la recherche et le développement dans le secteur. Le casque de Varjo, une entreprise finlandaise spécialisée dans les technologies de défense, ressemble à des lunettes de sécurité. Il intègre des caméras, une technologie de suivi oculaire et de l’électronique pour simuler des scénarios militaires à fort enjeu. La précision est primordiale dans son travail, car chaque élément influe sur l’efficacité du produit final. Varjo, comme des centaines d’autres entreprises finlandaises, contribue à l’essor du secteur des technologies de défense du pays. Helsinki est devenu un centre européen de premier plan pour l’investissement dans la défense, la sécurité et la résilience. Demande de technologies de défense Les casques avancés de Varjo offrent 80 programmes de simulation aux forces de l’OTAN, surpassant la réalité virtuelle conventionnelle en intégrant des environnements réels à un contenu synthétique. C’est ce que rapporte la BBC. Cette expérience de « réalité mixte » réduit considérablement le temps et le coût des méthodes de formation traditionnelles. L’entreprise a suscité un intérêt considérable à la suite de l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie et de l’adhésion de la Finlande à l’OTAN qui s’en est suivie. Avant le conflit, les investisseurs hésitaient souvent à soutenir les technologies ayant des applications militaires en raison de préoccupations sociales et environnementales. Toutefois, l’évolution du paysage géopolitique a inversé cette tendance, faisant des technologies de défense un investissement intéressant. Environnement entrepreneurial finlandais D’autres start-ups finlandaises connaissent également une croissance rapide. Iceye fournit des services d’imagerie et de données satellitaires à haute résolution, tandis que Reorbit propose des solutions logicielles pour les satellites. Distance Technologies, soutenue par Google, développe des technologies immersives qui sont testées sur des véhicules blindés par Patria, une ancienne entreprise de défense finlandaise. Le succès des entreprises finlandaises de technologie de défense est renforcé par la prospérité de la scène technologique générale du pays. De nombreux entrepreneurs ont acquis de l’expérience chez Nokia, l’ancien géant de la téléphonie mobile, avant de se lancer dans de nouvelles entreprises. Helsinki a également donné naissance à des licornes comme Oura et Supercell, démontrant ainsi le potentiel entrepreneurial de la ville. Business Finland, une agence gouvernementale, soutient activement le secteur des technologies de la défense par le biais d’un programme de 120 millions d’euros visant à encourager la recherche et le développement. Cette collaboration public-privé souligne l’urgence de faire progresser la position de la Finlande dans ce domaine qui évolue rapidement.

Monica Barbaro and Timothée Chalamet as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan in \"A Complete Unknown.\" Searchlight Pictures This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . Monica Barbaro plays Joan Baez in \"A Complete Unknown,\" which follows Bob Dylan's early career. Barbaro told BI that she and Timothée Chalamet, who plays Dylan, first met at a music rehearsal. Barbaro did vocal training to sing like Baez and duet with Chalamet's Dylan.\nIn \"A Complete Unknown,\" Timothée Chalamet and Monica Barbaro inhabit two musical legends: Bob Dylan and Joan Baez . True to form, the actors first met on set at a music rehearsal.\nAdvertisement The film, directed by James Mangold, stars Chalamet as a young Dylan during the early years of his career, from his 1962 debut self-titled album through his controversial pivot to electric instrumentation . It features many of Dylan's contemporaries from the era, including Baez (Barbaro), Pete Seeger (Edward Norton), and Johnny Cash (Boyd Holbrook) .\nTimothée Chalamet playing Bob Dylan in \"A Complete Unknown.\" Macall Polay The film's greatest strength is its music, much of which was recorded live on set. Not only does Chalamet perform live as Dylan, but he duets in-character with his collaborators. That led to the perfect meeting for the actors.\nAdvertisement \"We heard each other's voices in recording studio sessions, because I would sing duets to his voice,\" Barbaro told Business Insider. \"The first time we met was a music rehearsal, and it was just the most beautiful experience to me.\"\nLike Chalamet, Barbaro also did vocal training to play Baez in the film, working to emulate the singer's trilling vibrato while also researching Baez's life and career. The actor told BI that she knew the music was going to be \"the biggest hill to climb,\" and she knew that Chalamet — who spent five years preparing to play Dylan — had been practicing. By the time they first met, she felt ready to hold her ground not only as an actor, but as a musician.\n\"Getting to play next to him and hear the harmonies of our voices and the accompaniment, so complementary of each other — that was a career highlight,\" Barbaro said.\nAdvertisement \"I'm so glad we waited until that point to meet each other and to work with each other,\" she continued. \"It was more true to a Bob and Joan version of the meeting that we'd have these musical proficiencies, that we could collaborate and play together.\"\nRead next Movies Advertisement Close icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.
