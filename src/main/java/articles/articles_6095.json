    "text": "- Herbert Miller, 63, a reverend at Woodbury United Methodist Church, has been charged with dealing methamphetamine out of his church rectory. - However, the reverend fled the court on Friday and now local police are seeking to re-arrest him. <!– <!– <!– <!– <!– <!– <!– A Connecticut church pastor accused of dealing methamphetamine out of his church rectory fled court Thursday and local police are seeking his re-arrest. Herbert Miller, 63, a reverend at Woodbury United Methodist Church, was arrested earlier this month after being detained by state police in Woodbury. The reverend attended Waterbury Superior Court court Friday morning for his arraignment, but left the courthouse around 10 a.m. during a break. When Miller could not be located, the prosecutor again issued an arrest warrant. Miller was stopped by state troopers who observed that he was operating his vehicle with a suspended registration. He was found in possession of crystal methamphetamine, both in rock and liquid form, the latter of which was discovered in a hypodermic needle, ready to be injected. A Connecticut church pastor accused of dealing methamphetamine out of his church rectory fled court Thursday and local police are seeking his re-arrest. Herbert Miller, 63, a reverend at Woodbury United Methodist Church, attended court at Waterbury Superior Court, but left the courthouse around 10 a.m. during a recess. The Rev. Herbert Miller, 63, was arrested last week for possession of rock and liquid methamphetamine, as well as several other charges. Miller may have been selling methamphetamine in exchange for watching gay couples have sex, the New York Post reported. The allegation was reported by local media, although neither the Post nor the Daily Mail have been able to independently verify the claim. Police were reportedly alerted to Miller’s alleged illegal business and detained him with the help of a cooperating witness who helped facilitate a drug deal. Miller, who appears to have joined the Woodbury church as a pastor in July of last year, was charged with possession of narcotics with intent to sell, possession of a controlled substance and use of drug paraphernalia. He was released on $10,000 bail and ordered to appear before a judge in Waterbury Superior Court on Feb. 23. Miller is now expected to return to court on Monday, pending the status of his new arrest. Miller has been removed by his employer from the church’s website (his employment status is not yet clear), but several of his previously live-streamed sermons remain on the congregation’s YouTube page. In recent sermons, he appears to be missing some of his bottom teeth. Miller has been removed by his employer from the church’s website, but several of his previously live-streamed sermons remain on the congregation’s YouTube page. Miller has been pastor of Woodbury United Methodist Church since last July. From 2004 to 2018, he worked at Park Slope United Methodist Church in Brooklyn, where he participated in community social justice projects. Prior to his tenure at Woodbury Methodist, Miller served as pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Shelton, Connecticut. From 2004 to 2018, he was employed by Park Slope United Methodist Church in Brooklyn, where, according to the church’s website, he led the congregation’s popular Sunday dinner program. He also oversaw the church’s support of the Occupy Wall Street movement as it developed in 2011.",

    "text": "DENVER, CO / ACCESS Newswire / April 2, 2025 / Swedish clean-water-tech leader Bluewater is relaunching in the United States this April with a mission-driven focus: to revolutionize how Americans access clean, safe, and sustainable drinking water - while fighting back against the dual crises of tap water contaminated with toxic chemicals and plastic pollution.\nFollowing a pandemic-related pause in its North American expansion, Bluewater is re-entering the U.S. market with its award-winning line of compact under-sink purifiers, professional kitchen systems, and high-capacity outdoor dispensers - all designed to provide water that is not only safer but also significantly reduces dependence on single-use bottles.\n\"Millions of Americans are unknowingly drinking water contaminated with toxic chemicals every day,\" said Niklas Ivarsson, President, Bluewater North America. \"It's a public health issue - but it's also an environmental one. Our solutions provide a clean, planet-friendly alternative to bottled water that works in homes, restaurants, and large-scale events.\"\nIvarsson said Bluewater is relaunching with a clearly-defined new business structure that operates across the company's three core areas of play: Commercial (HoReCa), HOME, and Events and Venues. \"From Alaska to Florida, California to New York - wherever Americans thirst for pure, great-tasting water, Bluewater delivers. Whether at home, in the office, on the factory floor, or at the nation's biggest sporting events, our cutting-edge technology ensures purer hydration is always within reach,\" said Ivarsson.\nBluewater's cutting-edge purification systems remove up to 99.7% of harmful contaminants, including PFAS (‘forever chemicals'), heavy metals, microplastics, and radioactive elements now commonly found in both tap and bottled water. These chemicals have been linked to serious health conditions including cancer, thyroid disease, and developmental disorders.\nRecent data from the Environmental Working Group (EWG) underscores the urgency: its 2024 Tap Water Database update revealed 324 different contaminants across nearly 50,000 water systems in the U.S., often at levels far exceeding what independent scientists consider safe.\nYet while awareness of water toxicity grows, bottled water consumption continues to rise - exacerbating another crisis: plastic pollution. In the U.S. alone, over 60 million plastic bottles are thrown away every day, many ending up in landfills or oceans where they degrade into microplastics - particles now found in human blood, lungs, and placentas.\nBluewater offers a bold alternative. Its home and commercial systems empower users to generate ultra-purified, mineral-balanced water at the point of use - no transportation, no plastic waste. For outdoor events and venues, its mobile dispensers eliminate the need for trucked-in bottled water, slashing emissions and waste at scale.\n\"Bluewater is about turning the tide on two environmental threats at once,\" said Ivarsson. \"We provide water that's safer for people - and better for the planet.\"\nThe brand has earned global recognition for its impact, winning multiple Fast Company World Changing Ideas Awards, a 2024 GOOD DESIGN® Award from the Chicago Athenaeum, and a 2025 Best New Product nod at the Dubai World of Coffee Expo for its Café Station, which helps specialty coffee roasters and cafés purify and optimize water without plastic or chemical additives. Bluewater has also been honoured with a K&B Kitchen Innovation of the Year Award and was named a ‘2024 Best Buy' in the UK by The Caterer hospitality magazine.\nAbout Bluewater\nFounded in 2013 in Stockholm, Sweden, Bluewater has set its sights on being the world's most planet-friendly water purification and beverage company by innovating and marketing disruptive hydration solutions for home, work, and play. Bluewater products are available to consumers, hotel and catering operations, event and venue organizations, and educational institutions.

    "text": "By Andrew LEESON\nPublished 03/05/25 AT 8:48 PM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Flipboard Share on Pocket\nA woman paddles past a yacht at Wellington Point in Brisbane on March 5, 2025. Tropical Cyclone Alfred veered towards Australia's densely populated eastern coast on March 5, sparking emergency warnings, closing hundreds of schools, and threatening to flood thousands of homes. AFP The outer fringe of a tropical cyclone started whipping eastern Australia on Thursday, bringing drenching rains and record-breaking waves to a heavily populated region rarely hit by typhoons.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred was 285 kilometres (180 miles) east of busy Brisbane city after unexpectedly slowing above the Coral Sea overnight, government forecasts said.\nSome four million people were in the firing line along a 400-kilometre (250-mile) stretch of coastline expected to see the worst of the storm.\n\"We're already seeing gales developing on the coastal fringe,\" Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Sarah Scully told AFP.\n\"There have been very large waves and powerful swells. That's generated by Alfred lingering in the Coral Sea and creating a whole lot of wave energy.\"\nA 12.4-metre (40-foot) wave was recorded on the Gold Coast south of Brisbane, Scully said, the largest swell ever picked up by that monitoring station.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred was initially forecast to strike land late on Thursday evening, but was now expected to arrive Friday afternoon or even early Saturday morning.\nWhile this gave coastal hamlets more time to stack sandbags and stockpile food, Scully warned it also left them exposed to wild weather on the storm's outer edges.\n\"It will mean that the coastal areas are exposed for a longer period of time.\"\nSome towns had already seen \"well over\" 200 millimetres (8 inches) of rain, Scully said.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred would cross the coast somewhere near the bustling metropolitan hub of Brisbane, the weather bureau said.\nIt would be the first cyclone to make landfall in the area for more than 50 years.\n\"There's a lot of people in harm's way here. We're talking about something like four-and-a-half million Australians,\" said senior government minister Jim Chalmers.\n\"It's rare for a cyclone to be this far south and to threaten such a huge population area.\"\nAmerican rap star Ice Cube was caught in the storm ahead of concert dates in southern cities Sydney and Melbourne.\n\"I'm staying clear of it. I haven't been through a cyclone before. I can check this off my bucket list for sure,\" he told Australia's Channel 10.\n\"I'm right here on the beach. The beach looks like it is going to be in the lobby in a minute.\"\nStrong winds knocked out power to more than 4,000 homes, utility company Essential Energy said.\nMore than 900 schools across Queensland and the flood-prone northern rivers region of New South Wales were closed on Thursday morning, education department officials said.\nWhile cyclones are common in the warm tropical waters lapping Australia's northern flank, it is rarer for them to form in cooler waters further south.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred would be the first to make landfall in that part of Australia since 1974, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\nResearchers have repeatedly warned that climate change amplifies the risk of natural disasters such as bushfires, floods and cyclones.\nA resident watches massive waves stirred by tropical cyclone Alfred break onto the North Wall breakwater located at the coastal town of Ballina on March 5, 2025. A rare tropical cyclone veered towards Australia's densely populated eastern coast on March 5, forcing scores of schools to close as worried residents stripped supermarket shelves bare.

Hay empresas afiliadas que al día de hoy todavía no han podido reaperturar su negocio, pero estamos intentando cambiar la mentalidad e intentar crear nuevas formas de hacer negocios a través de la digitalización e incursionar en nuevas formas de mercado”, señaló la líder empresarial. Reunión en Zona Diamante de Acapulco Al encabezar la “Gala de la Mujer” que reunió en la zona Diamante de Acapulco, a más de un centenar de dueñas de negocios para reuniones comerciales y capacitación, Liliana Palomares detalló que tras el impacto del ciclón, AMEXME estableció estrategias para reanudar los vínculos comerciales con otros estados del país. En ese sentido, indicó que pese a que en la etapa de emergencia, el Gobierno Federal ofreció distintos créditos para el sector empresarial, la entrega de estos se frenó por la veda del proceso electoral pasado. Precisó que las alternativas respondieron a la necesidad de las empresarias de reconstruir sus emprendimientos para no despedir a más de seis mil empleados. “Todas las empresas no dejaron de pagar a sus trabajadores, independientemente de que tuvieran o no abiertos sus negocios. Hemos hecho una gran labor porque estamos comprometidas con la reactivación de nuestro municipio”, añadió. La presidenta de AMEXME capítulo Guerrero afirmó que aún predominan las brechas entre empresarios y empresarias, y resaltó que de ahí surge la necesidad de agruparse en una organización femenil, que a través de la capacitación, autoconsumo, vínculos comerciales y promoción también les permite compaginar los roles que desempeñan como líderes empresariales, jefas de familia, madres y cuidadoras. Durante la Gala de la Mujer, además del encuentro empresarial se realizó una exhibición comercial de productos de las empresas de servicios que concentra AMEXME en Guerrero. DRV",

    "text": "EAU CLAIRE — The Correctional Facility Financial Education program, created by Royal Credit Union, was recognized both state-wide and nationally with two awards that recognize the program’s commitment to financial literacy. Named after the credit union pioneer Alphonse Desjardins, the Desjardins Adult Financial Education Award highlights the credit union industry’s commitment to financial education for all ages. Royal’s CFFE program received both a first place award from the Wisconsin Credit Union League and a third place award at the national level from the Credit Union National Association, or CUNA, for their work in 2023. This is the first time that Royal has received an award for this program since it began back in 2015. The awards will be presented at a virtual reception hosted by CUNA on Jan. 23, 2024. “Royal is incredibly honored to have received Desjardins Awards on both the state and national levels recognizing the continued growth and success of our correctional facility financial education program,” said Brandon Riechers, Royal president and CEO. “The program is designed to help individuals achieve financial well-being and supports our core purpose which is to create a positive impact in the lives we touch. We are proud to have provided financial education to 3,000 people in the care of area correctional facilities and hope our program provides them with the tools they need to accomplish their financial goals.” Melissa Janssen, program director of Community Relations at Royal, said the program entails two to three 90-minute sessions that are offered both in-person and virtually to provide financial education, tools and resources for correctional facilities. Each program is personalized to meet the needs of their correctional facility, and Janssen said they cover all four elements of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Financial Well-Being Scale: control, capacity, choice and goal. “The gentlemen who attend the presentation gain knowledge in budgeting and paying off debt, which helps them once released,” said Heather Ryan, treatment specialist II and PREA victim service coordinator at Chippewa Valley Correctional Treatment Facility. “Dealing with finances is stressful for many people, and this encourages them to consider the potential challenges and opportunities prior to release. They do this by practicing to make a budget and participating in several other activities so they can plan and be prepared for what’s ahead.” As this program has been providing this service since October of 2015, Janssen said it first began at the Eau Claire County Jail as a partnership with a local non-profit organization, Literacy Chippewa Valley. “At the time, Literacy Chippewa Valley was already offering a variety of educational programs in the jail and asked if Royal would be interested in joining their efforts by providing financial literacy training,” she said. “Royal’s Community Financial Education Coordinator developed a curriculum focused on important money management topics like understanding spending habits, creating a budget, dealing with debit, and building credit. This curriculum was well-received by students.” After its initial success, Janssen said it was clear that this program could be replicated in other correctional facilities. By September of 2016, they had managed to create a program which was entirely run by Royal and led by Member Account Representatives from their Rice Lake office at the Barron County Jail. CFFE is now offered in four prisons, six jails and one juvenile detention center across Wisconsin and Minnesota. The success of their program even allowed Royal to partner with the University of Wisconsin-Stout’s Applied Research Center to measure its effectiveness. The results showed significant gains in attitudes and confidence levels regarding financial literacy,” said Janssen. “Royal used these findings to publish a whitepaper with the National Credit Union Foundation to help other credit unions create their own correctional facility financial education programs.” The whitepaper can be found on Royal Credit Union’s website, at rcu.org/CorrectionalEducation . With the Desjardin Awards as one of the highest honors in the credit union industry, Janssen and Royal Credit Union are honored to have received this recognition. “Receiving these awards is a testament to the positive impact Royal’s CFFE program is making in the communities they serve and their ongoing commitment to promoting financial well-being for all,” said Janssen. “Justice-involved individuals are an underserved population that often struggle to receive access to legitimate financial services and educational support.” Subscribe to the Leader Telegram",
