    "title": "研究：手机成瘾使青少年自杀风险增三倍",
    "text": "【大纪元2025年06月26日讯】（英文大纪元专栏作家Cara Michelle Miller撰文／曾子衡编译）越来越多的青少年使用手机和社群媒体不再只是出于兴趣或休闲，而是变成一种“控制不了自己”的习惯。许多孩子到了10岁时，可能因为使用手机或社交媒体成瘾使他们自杀的风险比一般孩子高出两倍甚至三倍。\n一项新的纵向研究发现，青少年如果沉迷于手机、电玩或社群媒体，到了青春期的初期阶段，出现自杀念头与情绪困扰的概率将大幅提升。该研究结果于周三（6月25日）刊登于《JAMA Network Open》期刊。（点此观看）\n研究的第一作者、威尔康乃尔医学院副教授萧韵瑜（Yunyu Xiao，音译）在一封致《大纪元时报》的电邮中说：“最重要的结论是，真正增加风险的并非手机屏幕使用的时间长短，而是他们使用手机的行为模式，这才是关键。”\n如果孩子在离开手机时感到不安、无法让自己停止使用应用程式，或习惯依靠手机来应对情绪，他们最有可能出现强迫性使用手机的行为，而这种情况往往与日后的心理健康困扰有关。\n萧韵瑜表示，这项发现将人们讨论的重点从单纯关注屏幕使用的时间长短，转移到更具体且深入地研究手机成瘾的问题。\n风险与早期征兆\n作为青少年大脑认知发展研究计划的一部分，他们对超过4,200名儿童进行四年的追踪研究。这是美国历史上最大规模的长期大脑发展研究。\n不同于过去聚焦屏幕总使用时间的研究，研究人员分析了“成瘾使用的发展趋势”，即随着时间推移，使用者变得越来越难以控制、在情绪上依赖屏幕以及难以停止使用。研究发现，这种分析方式比单纯计算看手机屏幕时间更能有效预测自杀风险。\n研究中的孩子们会被问到一些问题，比如：当不能用手机时会感到难过或不舒服吗？当心情不好时会通过使用社交媒体来让自己感觉好一点吗？\n研究团队将根据孩子们的回答，观察他们在使用屏幕和对装置的情感依赖方面随时间的变化，并将他们分为低风险、风险上升和高风险三类。\n研究发现，近一半的孩子出现“高度”或“逐渐增加”依赖手机的迹象，这种情况通常从约10岁开始出现。\n到了14岁时，近三分之一的孩子“越来越难以控制”地使用社群媒体；同时，大约四分之一的孩子在使用手机时也有类似的行为。与低成瘾使用的孩子相比，这些孩子出现自杀念头或行为的可能性高出2.4倍。\n研究指出，超过30%的孩子在青春期初期从原本的低风险行为模式发展为高风险，这样的变化往往会带来严重的后果。\n“让我们感到惊讶的是，屏幕使用总时数与自杀相关行为或心理健康结果之间没有明显的关联。相比之下，成瘾使用的发展趋势——包括高度且不断上升的强迫性、情绪困扰与难以脱离屏幕，则让青少年出现自杀念头或行为的风险增加两到三倍有关。”萧韵瑜表示。\n研究发现，女孩比男孩更容易养成问题性的社群媒体使用习惯；相比之下，男孩则更常出现对电子游戏的成瘾使用行为。\n研究指出，除了增加自杀风险之外，过度依赖社群媒体的孩子常出现焦虑、忧郁、易怒或攻击性行为；而沉迷电玩则更容易出现悲伤、孤僻和长期情绪低落的情况。\n虽然这项研究没有具体说明为什么会有这些关联，但其它研究发现，情绪有困扰的孩子可能会通过使用屏幕（像是手机或电脑）来舒缓心情或逃避问题，然而，强迫性的使用反而可能让情况恶化，妨碍他们以更健康的方式处理复杂情绪。\n未参与此项研究、专门治疗“科技成瘾”青少年的心理治疗师汤玛斯‧克斯廷（Thomas Kersting）告诉《大纪元时报》，他发现这些孩子出现的情绪和行为问题往往超过了一般青少年常见的情绪起伏，不是普通的心情不好或情绪波动。\n“如果你的孩子在你拿走电子设备时变得具有攻击性甚至情绪爆炸，那不仅仅是态度问题，而是戒断症状。”克斯廷说，这是“初期的警示信号”，显示孩子对屏幕的依赖已经影响到他们的情绪健康。\n屏幕使用时间的差异性\n研究发现，关注孩子们使用屏幕的方式比单纯计算他们的屏幕使用时间更为关键。尽管如此，过度使用屏幕仍会影响睡眠、运动以及与人面对面互动等重要生活习惯。研究还发现，许多应用程式刻意设计得让人更容易上瘾、难以停止使用。\n儿童精神科医师维多利亚‧邓克利（Victoria Dunckley）接受《大纪元时报》访问时指出，孩子长时间使用屏幕和无法自控的使用习惯通常会同时出现，且都会使孩子的情绪更加敏感和脆弱。\n“屏幕对有些孩子来说有很强的吸引力，他们像飞蛾扑火一样，很难让自己停止使用，这种孩子更容易出现心理和行为上的问题。即使是平常大家认为‘正常’的屏幕使用，也越来越常跟情绪和行为困扰有关。不过，只要减少屏幕使用，孩子们的情况通常会有所改善。”邓克利说。\n邓克利表示，像社群媒体和电玩这类的互动性屏幕活动，会过度刺激神经系统，影响大脑的奖赏机制和生理时钟，并让身体长时间处于紧张状态。她强调，这些应用程式利用青少年发展阶段的弱点和天生本能，在强力吸引他们使用，因此期望青少年能在这些刻意“劫持大脑”的程式面前自我控制手机使用，这并不现实。\n家长应注意的征兆\n研究作者萧韵瑜建议家长思考以下几个问题：\n1. 我的孩子是否逐渐疏离现实生活中的活动与人际关系？\n2. 当无法使用手机、平板或电脑等电子设备时，孩子是否感到不安或难过？\n3. 即使有意愿停止使用，孩子是否无法自控地继续使用？\n克斯廷表示，孩子在手机或游戏被拿走时，如果情绪突然变得暴躁或不稳定，就是需要警惕的迹象。他举例说，平时乖巧的孩子如果突然表现出愤怒甚至出现大喊、骂人或动手的行为，那就是警讯。\n孩子可能会开始远离家庭，表现出悲伤或孤立的状态。克斯廷提醒，当看到这些迹象时，家长就应该采取行动“制定规范”，例如：晚上不允许在卧室使用电子设备，并鼓励孩子回到共享的生活空间与家人互动。\n重新设定生活节奏\n邓克利指出，过度使用屏幕会让情绪问题变得更严重，“过度使用屏幕”和“情绪困扰”互相影响、无法分开解决。\n“依我的经验，不先改善屏幕使用习惯，就很难有效处理心理健康问题。”她说。\n她建议家长了解屏幕对孩子神经系统的影响，尤其是在情绪、睡眠和专注力方面。对于情况较严重的孩子，邓克利建议采取三到四周的“屏幕戒断期”，帮助孩子重建情绪和行为的平衡。\n她指出，对成瘾的孩子来说，单纯减少使用往往效果有限；反之，完全暂停使用能让神经系统得到调整，进而促进孩子更有创造力、更社交化，并且积极参与各种游戏活动。\n专家们认为重点不在于完全戒掉屏幕，而是帮助孩子养成更合理、健康的使用方式。\n家庭小贴士\n1. 用餐和睡前时段避免使用电子屏幕。\n2. 鼓励孩子每天多参与不使用电子屏幕的实际活动，比如户外运动、玩游戏、阅读纸本书籍、和朋友或家人面对面互动等。\n3. 定期与孩子讨论他们的网络使用经验。\n4. 家长应该以身作则，示范健康且有节制的使用习惯，帮助孩子学会如何合理安排使用手机的时间和设立界限。\n萧韵瑜表示，家长“不能只关注孩子使用手机的时间长短，要注意他们使用手机是否影响到身心健康、人际关系以及日常生活”。\n责任编辑：李梦回#",

    "text": "Morocco: A rare deluge of rainfall left blue lagoons of water amid the palm trees and sand dunes of the Sahara desert, nourishing some of its driest regions with more water than they had seen in decades. Southeastern Morocco's desert is among the most arid places in the world and rarely experiences rain in late summer. The Moroccan government said two days of rainfall in September exceeded yearly averages in several areas that see less than 250 millimetres (10 inches) annually, including Tata, one of the areas hit hardest. In Tagounite, a village about 450 kilometres (280 miles) south of the capital, Rabat, more than 100 millimetres (3.9 inches) were recorded in a 24-hour period. WATCH: Water gushes through sand dunes after a rare rainfall in the Sahara desert The storms left striking images of water gushing through the Saharan sands amid castles and desert flora. NASA satellites showed water rushing in to fill Lake Iriqui, a famous lake bed between Zagora and Tata that had been dry for 50 years. In desert communities frequented by tourists, 4x4s motored through the puddles and residents surveyed the scene in awe. “It’s been 30 to 50 years since we’ve had this much rain in such a short space of time,\" said Houssine Youabeb of Morocco's General Directorate of Meteorology. Such rains, which meteorologists are calling an extratropical storm, may change the course of the region's weather in months and years to come as the air retains more moisture, causing more evaporation and drawing more storms, Youabeb said. Six consecutive years of drought have posed challenges for much of Morocco, forcing farmers to leave fields fallow and cities and villages to ration water. The bounty of rainfall will likely help refill the large groundwater aquifers beneath the desert that are relied upon to supply water in desert communities. The region's dammed reservoirs reported refilling at record rates throughout September. However, it's unclear how far September's rains will go toward alleviating drought. Water gushing through the sands and oases left more than 20 dead in Morocco and Algeria and damaged farmers' harvests, forcing the government to allocate emergency relief funds, including in some areas affected by last year's earthquake.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Caddo County, Oklahoma from 1901-2000 was 38.8. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Caddo County, Oklahoma experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Caddo County, Oklahoma history.",

    "text": "Cairo/Gaza: Israeli tanks advanced deep into a town in the central Gaza Strip on Thursday after days of relentless bombardment that forced tens of thousands of already displaced Palestinian families to flee in a new exodus.\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij, the armoured contingent having apparently advanced from orchards on the eastern outskirts.\nFurther south, Israeli forces struck the area around a hospital in the heart of Khan Younis, the Gaza Strip's main southern city, where residents feared a new ground push into territory crowded with families made homeless in 12 weeks of war.\nPalestinian health authorities said 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1 per cent of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead are feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nIsrael has escalated its ground offensive in Gaza sharply since just before Christmas despite public pleas from its closest ally the United States to scale the campaign down in the closing weeks of the year.\nIt launched the war to destroy the militant Islamist Hamas movement that runs Gaza after fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Of the hostages, 110 were freed during a short truce in late November and another 23 have now been declared dead in absentia, an Israeli government spokesperson said on Thursday.\nThe main focus of fighting is now in central areas south of the wetlands that bisect the narrow coastal strip, where Israeli forces have ordered civilians out over the past several days as their tanks close in.\nTens of thousands of people fleeing the densely packed Nusseirat, Bureij and Maghazi districts were heading south or west on Thursday into the already overwhelmed city of Deir al-Balah along the Mediterranean coast, crowding into hastily built camps of makeshift tents.\n\"Over 150,000 people - young children, women carrying babies, people with disabilities & the elderly - have nowhere to go,\" the main U.N. organisation operating in Gaza, UNRWA, said in a social media post.\nThe eastern part of Bureij was a theatre of heavy fighting on Thursday morning, with Israeli tanks thrusting in from the north and east, residents and militants said.\n\"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members.\n\"We are now in a tent in Deir al-Balah because of this brutal Israeli war,\" he told Reuters by phone, declining to give a second name for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad, living in a school in Deir al-Balah since fleeing from the north, said the people who were newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nWith food running out, he said he had made a perilous trip to Rafah near the Egyptian border to buy a 25-kg (55-lb) sack of flour for his family.\nFighting near hospital in Khan Younis\nKhan Younis, where Israeli forces advanced this month after a truce collapsed on Dec. 1, also came under heavy bombardment on Thursday morning from warplanes and tanks near the al-Amal hospital, west of Israeli positions.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent, which runs the hospital and has its headquarters nearby, said 10 Palestinians were killed and 12 wounded in one bombardment there, the third strike targeting the area around the hospital in less than an hour.\nResidents said they believed Israeli forces were trying to provoke a new exodus ahead of a further ground assault.\nNearby at Nasser Hospital, the main medical centre in Khan Younis and largest still functioning in Gaza, women and children shrieked as the dead and wounded were brought in.\nA toddler lay motionless on a cot while medics tried to revive him; one doctor nodded \"no,\" signalling the boy was dead.\nIsrael reported three more of its soldiers killed, bringing its toll in the ground campaign to 169. The past week has seen some of its heaviest losses of the war so far.\nVirtually all of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been driven from their homes at least once and many have been forced to flee several times. Only a handful of hospitals still function.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Israeli military said it \"regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\" from a Dec. 24 air strike on the Maghazi refugee camp that killed 70 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nThe military statement said warplanes struck two targets \"adjacent\" to where Hamas militants were operating, and a preliminary inquiry showed that further buildings nearby were also hit, \"which likely caused unintended harm to additional uninvolved civilians\".\n\"The IDF ... is acting to draw conclusions and learn lessons from this event,\" it added.\nThe Palestinian health ministry denounced the attack as a massacre in a crowded residential square.\nOver the course of the war, The Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas or using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nU.S. President Joe Biden warned earlier this month that \"indiscriminate bombing\" in Gaza jeopardised sympathy for Israel among its allies. Washington has said Israel should make a transition from full-scale ground war to a targeted campaign against Hamas leaders.\nEgypt, which has acted as a mediator including hosting the leader of Hamas last week, said it had put forward a proposal to end the bloodshed, including a three-stage plan for a ceasefire, but had yet to hear the warring sides' responses.\nIsrael says it will not halt its ground campaign until it annihilates Hamas, describing this as its only option to safeguard its security and free remaining hostages.\nPalestinians say wiping out Hamas is an unachievable aim given the militant group's diffuse structure and deep roots in a territory it has ruled since 2007.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 28 December 2023, 21:35 IST)",
