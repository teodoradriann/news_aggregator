    "text": "OFSTED highlights ‘failings’ in Torbay SEND services\nTorbay’s MP is to press the government for support after the bay’s services to some of its most vulnerable children were criticised in an official report.\nTorbay’s MP is to press the government for support after the bay’s services to some of its most vulnerable children were criticised in an official report.\nTorbay Council and NHS Devon both say ‘systemic reform’ at national level is needed.\nThe report from the watchdog Ofsted said there are ‘widespread failings’ in Torbay’s services to children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).\nOfsted says too many children and young people with Send issues have to wait too long for their needs to be assessed, and the people in charge do not always understand the priorities of their service.\nLeaders have not addressed major weaknesses highlighted at a previous inspection in 2021.\nOfsted says the failings have led to poor communication with families.\nThe report says: “Long waiting times for health assessment, and diagnosis, coupled with gaps in provision, often lead to children and young people’s needs becoming greater while they wait to get the right support.\n“As a result, families reach crisis, and they require more intensive support later. Some parents and carers told inspectors they have no option other than to home educate their child.”\nThe partnership between Torbay Council and NHS Devon which runs the service said it is committed to addressing the issues and an action plan will be prepared.\nA statement from Torbay Council director of children’s services Nancy Meehan and NHS Devon’s director Su Smart said improvement work is already under way.\nThey said: “We have robust plans in place to continue to build on the improvement work we have done to date. We are committed to addressing these challenges locally, but meaningful and lasting improvements require systemic reform at the national level.”\nThe report says there are things being done well for Send children, including early years support through family hubs, the work of the Mental Health in Schools team and the strength of the neurodiversity support programme.\nThe key worker service for young people with autism and learning difficulties is praised, as are school nursing teams.\nThe statement goes on: “We are committed to ongoing improvement across all Send provision and will continue to work with parents, carers and practitioners to develop and strengthen it.\n“Our priority remains the wellbeing and success of our children and young people.”\nThe bay’s Liberal Democrat MP Steve Darling said he would be taking the bay’s issues up at a national level.\nHe said: “I’m sadly not surprised, as we’ve had a lot of cases through my office regarding these issues.\n“We need to ensure that both the council and the health service are doubling down on the efforts to improve the service that is offered to youngsters in Torbay.”\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",

    "text": "USATSI North Carolina was the last team in the NCAA Tournament bracket 2025, but the Tar Heels' performance in their First Four matchup against San Diego State left no doubts they are one of the 68 best teams in the country. North Carolina demolished San Diego State, 95-68, on Tuesday and advances to play No. 6 seed Ole Miss in the Round of 64 on Thursday. Should the Rebels be put on upset alert for 2025 March Madness bracket picks after Tuesday night's blowout? The Tar Heels were the preseason No. 9 team in the country after adding two five-star freshmen to join guard RJ Davis. Davis was last year's ACC Player of the Year and he had 26 points, including making 6 of 6 3-pointers, on Tuesday. How dangerous is North Carolina the remainder of March Madness 2025? Before making any 2025 March Madness bracket predictions, be sure to check out the 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket picks from the proven computer model at SportsLine .\nTheir proven projection model has simulated every game in the tournament 10,000 times. It has absolutely crushed its March Madness picks recently, beating over 91 percent of all CBS Sports brackets in four of the past six tournaments. It was all over UConn's championship run a year ago and nailed 13 teams in the Sweet 16. It also nailed Alabama's Cinderella run to the Final Four as a 4-seed.\nIt knows how to spot an upset as well. The same model has produced brackets that have nailed 24 first-round upsets by double-digit seeds since its inception in 2016. There's simply no reason to rely on luck when there's proven technology to help you dominate your 2025 March Madness pools.\nNow, with the 2025 NCAA bracket being revealed, the model is simulating the matchups and its results are in. You can only see it over at SportsLine .\n2025 March Madness bracket games to watch One of the 2025 March Madness matchups to keep an eye on: No. 8 seed Mississippi State vs. No. 9 seed Baylor in the East Region. Baylor is led by senior forward Norchad Omier, who averages 15.9 points and 10.9 rebounds per game. Their freshman guard, VJ Edgecombe averaged 15.0 points per game and projects to be a high lottery pick in June's NBA Draft. The Aggies limp into March Madness having lost five of their last seven games, including by 12 to Missouri in the SEC Tournament. They are led by guard Josh Hubbard, who averaged 18.7 PPG. This matchup, which seems likely to be close, tips off on Friday at 12:15 p.m. ET.\nAlso in the East Region, BYU vs. VCU figures to be a pivotal 6 vs. 11 matchup. BYU makes no secret about how it wants to play. They want to shoot from far away, and do so often. The Cougars shot the 16th-most 3-pointers in college basketball and made the seventh-most, averaging 10.7 triples per contest. BYU had the 33rd best 3-point percentage (37.1%), despite shooting so often from deep that they aren't always open looks. But VCU is one of the best at defending the 3-point shot. The Rams rank 22nd in 3-point percentage against (30.6%), which helped them have the No. 6 overall scoring defense in the nation, allowing 62.5 ppg. This matchup of strength vs. strength makes for an intriguing 6 vs. 11 matchup with No. 6 seeds having a .609 win percentage in the opening round, which is the second-lowest of the eight higher seeds.\nThe third matchup to watch in the East Region features No. 3 seed Wisconsin vs. No. 14 seed Montana. The Grizzlies are making their first March Madness appearance since 2019 and they have only made it out of the first round once in 11 trips dating back to 1991. They should be full of confidence, however, since they have won 14 of their last 15 games and were runners-up in the Big Sky Tournament. Montana's swagger could be a threat to Wisconsin, who were a No. 5 seed in last year's tournament and lost to No. 12 James Madison 72-61. Senior guard John Tonje leads the Badgers with 19.2 average points per game, and the team will lean on him to help overwhelm a Montana defense that gave up 72.9 average points a night this season. You can see how far all these teams go over at SportsLine .\nHow to make 2025 NCAA bracket predictions How far will those major programs go? And which Cinderella teams will make surprising runs through the 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket?
