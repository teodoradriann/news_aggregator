    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "NordPass' latest research reveals the most commonly used passwords worldwide, and unfortunately, many of these can be cracked in less than a second. The most used password globally and in India is ‘123456’, followed by others like ‘123456789’ and ‘password’. These simple combinations are easy for hackers to guess, putting your personal and work accounts at risk.Top Passwords in IndiaThe research found that Indian users tend to stick to easily memorable phrases like:Indya123Abcd1234AdminWhile these are easy to remember, they are also among the easiest to crack. Notably, ‘password’ is the second most used password in India, a practice still widely seen in other countries, including the UK and Australia.Corporate Accounts at RiskThe study also reveals that a significant number of corporate accounts are at risk, with default passwords like ‘newmember‘ or ‘admin‘ being commonly used. Many employees even use the same passwords for personal and work-related accounts, making their entire digital lives vulnerable to cybercriminals.The Growing ThreatExperts warn that nearly 78 per cent of the world’s most common passwords can be cracked in under a second, a significant rise from last year's 70 per cent. This trend highlights the worsening state of password security, with millions still using simple combinations that make it easy for hackers to breach accounts.How to protect yourselfTo avoid becoming a target, experts recommend using strong passwords that are at least 20 characters long and feature a mix of numbers, letters, and special symbols. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites, and enable multi-factor authentication for added protection. If you find complex passwords difficult to remember, consider using a password manager to store them securely.Do not risk your digital security. Change your passwords to something more robust today, and ensure your personal and professional accounts are safe from cyber threats.ALSO READ: Samsung Galaxy S25 series to launch on January 23: What to expect?",

    "text": "The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA)\nlatest Loan Monitoring Survey has revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance nationwide continues to fall, dropping by three basis points from 0.26% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior month to 0.23% as of December 31, 2023.\nThe MBA estimates that 115,000 homeowners are in forbearance plans nationwide, as mortgage servicers have provided forbearance to approximately 8.1 million borrowers since March 2020.\nIn December 2023, the share of GSE loans (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) in forbearance declined one basis point from 0.16% to 0.15%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased eight basis points from 0.47% to 0.39%, and the forbearance share for portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) decreased three basis points from 0.30% to 0.27%.\n“Forbearance as a loss mitigation option is diminishing,” said\nMarina Walsh, CMB, MBA’s VP of Industry Analysis. “While forbearance is a powerful tool for delinquency surges resulting from natural disasters or major disruptions such as a pandemic, today’s borrowers are not experiencing widespread financial distress. The overall performance of servicing portfolios–particularly government loans–declined in December. Factors such as seasonality, a changing labor market, resumption of student loan payments, and the rise in balances on other forms of consumer debt are likely at play.”\nWalsh also noted that MBA anticipates that the unemployment rate, a leading indicator of mortgage performance, is expected to increase gradually to 4.5% by the end of 2024, up from 3.7% at year-end 2023.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 216,000 in December, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%. Employment continued to trend up in government, healthcare, social assistance, and construction, while transportation and warehousing lost jobs.\nBy reason, 61.2% of borrowers are in forbearance for reasons such as a temporary hardship caused by job loss, death, divorce, or disability; while 26.8% of borrowers are in forbearance due to COVID-19-related reasons. Another 12% are in forbearance due to natural disasters.\nBy stage, 51.7% of total loans in forbearance are in the initial forbearance plan stage, while 31.5% are in a forbearance extension. The remaining 16.8% are forbearance re-entries, including re-entries with extensions.\nOf the cumulative forbearance exits for the period from July 1, 2020, through December 31, 2023, at the time of forbearance exit:\n- 29.4% resulted in a loan deferral/partial claim.\n- 17.7% represented borrowers who continued to make their monthly payments during their forbearance period.\n- 18.5% represented borrowers who did not make all of their monthly payments and exited forbearance without a loss mitigation plan in place yet.\n- 16.0% resulted in a loan modification or trial loan modification.\n- 10.7% resulted in reinstatements, in which past-due amounts are paid back when exiting forbearance.\n- 6.5% resulted in loans paid off through either a refinance or by selling the home.\n- The remaining 1.2% resulted in repayment plans, short sales, deed-in-lieus or other reasons.\nThe five states reporting the highest share of loans that were current as a percent of servicing portfolio included:\n- Washington\n- Colorado\n- Idaho\n- Oregon\n- Montana\nThe five states with the lowest share of loans that were current as a percent of servicing portfolio included:\n- Louisiana\n- Mississippi\n- Indiana\n- New York\n- Illinois\nTotal completed loan workouts from 2020 and onward (repayment plans, loan deferrals/partial claims, loan modifications) that were current as a percent of total completed workouts were 74.39% in December 2023, which was 21 basis points below the percentage of total loans serviced that were current for the month.\nMBA’s monthly Loan Monitoring Survey covers the period from December 1 through December 31, 2023, and represents 64% of the first-mortgage servicing market (31.9 million loans).",

    "title": "Mark Daigneault said his pairing with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was 'not accidental'",
    "text": "An underrated element of the Oklahoma City Thunder's success this season is continuity. Over the last four years, OKC has had the same coach and star pairing of Mark Daigneault and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Both have ascended among their respective peers as some of the best in the league. Daigneault capped off an outstanding season with Coach of the Year and Gilgeous-Alexander was named a finalist for MVP. Gilgeous-Alexander recently spoke about his relationship with Daigneault, which has grown over the last four seasons. The 25-year-old spoke highly of him and said he's the best head coach he's ever had. “It just makes it easy to play. I think I can say that for the guys across the whole team,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"He’s so easy to play for because he’s humble, he doesn’t love taking credit, he doesn’t take care about himself, he’s selfless. When he messes up he owns it. “Because he’s that way, he can get on us. He can hold us accountable because he holds himself accountable.\" All things Thunder: Latest Oklahoma City Thunder news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more. Daigneault was asked about Gilgeous-Alexander's comments. The 39-year-old said that it's not a coincidence they both received promotions at the same time. \"That’s not accidental. I think that’s some of the wisdom that Sam (Presti's) done with this second time around. He was very transparent at that time with what the plan was,\" Daigneault said. \"... It gave everybody the same starting point.\" Arguably the most important relationship for a title contender is between the head coach and franchise star. If both are on the same page, the sky is the limit as that synergy will trickle down the rest of the roster. If not, it can make for a very awkward and ugly situation where a squad's shortcomings turn into a blame game. For the Thunder, it appears they've nailed that relationship with Gilgeous-Alexander and Daigneault.",

    "text": "La Contraloría General advirtió a la Dirección Regional de Salud (Diresa) Moquegua que existe retraso y atención insuficiente para identificar a pobladores expuestos al consumo de agua que contienen metales pesados en niveles superiores a lo permitido.\nEn el Informe de Visita de Control N.° 060-2024-OCI/0829-SVC s e señalan incumplimientos en las acciones programadas para identificar y tratar a las personas afectadas por proveerse agua de afluentes, canales, y ojos de agua que presentan contaminación con elementos como aluminio, manganeso, cadmio y arsénico.\nAunque la Ley de Presupuesto Fiscal 2024 asignó S/ 302 946 a la Diresa Moquegua para estas actividades, los objetivos no se cumplieron en su totalidad.\nPor ejemplo, se planificó realizar tamizajes entre julio y setiembre para 747 personas, incluyendo niños y adultos. Sin embargo, en setiembre, solo se remitió al laboratorio toxicológico del Centro Nacional de Salud Ocupacional y Protección del Ambiente para la Salud (CENSOPAS), las muestras de 375 personas, dejando pendientes 372 muestras de orina.\nLea también: San Martín identifica 351 fuentes contaminantes en ríos y quebradas de cuenca del Huallaga\nSin cumplir funciones\nLa Contraloría también identificó que los profesionales contratados por locación de servicios con el presupuesto transferido, no cumplieron funciones exclusivas relacionadas con la exposición a metales pesados.\nEl nutricionista, contratado de marzo a agosto, evaluó a niños y madres gestantes, mientras que el biólogo, contratado de marzo a diciembre, se dedicó a la toma de muestras y exámenes clínicos en laboratorios del Comité Local de Administración de Salud Torata. Es decir, cumplieron funciones propias de los centros de salud y no directas al objetivo de la transferencia económica.\nLas muestras de orina destinadas a detectar alteraciones en los organismos afectados se recolectaron únicamente entre julio y septiembre, a pesar de que el presupuesto cubría todo el año 20 24. Al 19 de diciembre, el gasto ejecutado alcanzó el 85.2 % del monto asignado.\nMás en Andina: ??

    "title": "Les émeutes à Los Angeles, symbole de la dérive autocratique de Donald Trump",
    "text": "Si l’on en croit Donald Trump, les Etats Unis ne savent plus où donner de la tête. Le pays fait face à une \"invasion\" de sans papiers, une insurrection violente à Los Angeles, de potentielles pénuries pétrolières, un déficit commercial massif provoqué par les partenaires étrangers… Pour lutter contre cette multitude de crises, le président a lancé une série de décrets proclamant l’état d’urgence, même si, dans nombre de cas, cela ne semble pas nécessaire.\n\"Il invente des fausses situations d’urgence pour s’arroger des pouvoirs extraordinaires\", résume Kim Scheppele, spécialiste de la chute des démocraties à l’université de Princeton. Cela lui permet de passer outre le Congrès pour imposer ses réformes de manière très autocratique et, accessoirement, apparaître comme l’homme providentiel, celui qui sauve le pays. Sur les quatre premiers mois de sa présidence, il a promulgué pas moins de huit déclarations d’urgence, bien plus que ses prédecesseurs. En comparaison, Joe Biden en avait lancé 11 en quatre ans, Barack Obama 12 en huit ans, selon le Brennan Center.\nTrump a déclaré l’état d’urgence nationale à la frontière mexicaine, ce qui lui a permis de réorienter les ressources militaires sur cette zone, de continuer la construction du mur et d’y stationner l’armée et la Garde nationale. Sa déclaration d’urgence sur les cartels de la drogue, estampillés désormais organisation terroriste, a facilité les expulsions de membres de soi-disant gangs. En avril, la Maison-Blanche, invoquant un état d’urgence économique suite à l’ampleur du déficit commercial, a pu mettre en place, sans avoir à suivre les procédures habituelles, des hausses de droits de douane immédiates pour toute la planète. L’urgence énergétique a pour but d’accélérer les projets de forages en réduisant les réglementations en matière d’environnement. Quant au fait d’invoquer l’urgence nationale contre la contrebande de fentanyl, opioïde très puissant qui a conduit à des centaines de milliers d’overdoses, cela lui a permis de justifier des hausses de taxes douanières contre le Canada en représailles, même si le trafic passe principalement par le Mexique.\nMesures injustifiées\nEt tant pis si nombre de ces crises nationales ne sont pas réélles, ni même urgentes. Le déficit commercial existe depuis des décennies. Les Etats Unis, contrairement aux dires du décret, n’ont pas \"un approvisionnement en énergie et des infrastructures inadéquates\" qui vont s’aggraver s’il n’y a pas de \"remède immédiat\". Ils sont le premier producteur mondial de pétrole et de gaz. Quant au déploiement de la Garde nationale et des Marines à Los Angeles, Donald Trump en a profité pour jouer l’homme fort, faire plaisir à sa base anti-immigration et attaquer son ennemi, le gouverneur Gavin Newsom. Qu’importe si les manifestations sont restées sporadiques et d’une ampleur limitée et si la police de Los Angeles disait avoir le controle de la situation. Sans son intervention, la ville aurait été \"complètement anéantie\", a affirmé le président. L’Etat de Californie a lancé une action en justice contre l’administration pour avoir autorisé le déploiement sans l’aval du gouverneur.\n\"Il a trouvé les failles…\" : comment Donald Trump est en train de faire des Etats-Unis une dictature\n\"Le recours à l’autorité d’urgence n’est pas inhabituel. D’autres présidents s’en sont servis. Ce qui est unique pour Donald Trump, c’est la manière dont il l’utilise pour repousser les limites de cette autorité\", estime Elena Chachko, professeur à l’université de Droit de Berkeley. Ses prédecesseurs y ont souvent eu recours pour imposer des sanctions contre des pays ennemis comme la Corée du Nord ou dans de vraies situation de crise - pandémie ou attentats du 11 septembre 2001. Donald Trump, lui, s’en sert pour gouverner sans contraintes. C'est une tactique pour mettre en place ses politiques sans attendre et elle n’est pas la seule. \"Il multiplie aussi la promulgation de décrets ordinaires pour appliquer des mesures qu’il ne pourrait pas prendre autrement, comme les réductions drastiques de subventions publiques à la recherche scientifique\", poursuit Kim Scheppele.\nSi Donald Trump met autant à profit ces pouvoirs d’urgence, c’est que le Congrès, au fil du temps, a donné beaucoup de lattitude aux présidents pour qu’ils puissent agir rapidement en cas de crise majeure. Il n’y a pas, aux Etats-Unis, de définition du terme \"urgence\". L'appréciation en revient donc à la discrétion du chef de l’Etat. Lors de son premier mandat, Donald Trump en a fait usage pour essayer de s’octroyer des fonds, refusés par le Congrès, pour financer son mur à la frontière. Joe Biden l’a invoqué pour tenter d’annuler 400 milliards de dette étudiante. Là encore, la Cour suprême a invalidé son action.\nManque de garde-fous\nMais il existe peu de garde fous pour contrer une utilisation abusive. Le Congrès ne peut y mettre un terme qu’avec une majorité des deux tiers - autant dire une tâche impossible, compte tenu des divisions politiques. Restent les tribunaux. Récemment, plusieurs juges ont estimé que Donald Trump avait outrepassé ses prérogatives sur l’imposition de taxes douanières. En attendant de statuer, une Cour d’appel les a maintenus temporairement.\nDonald Trump, crise climatique… Les nouveaux combats du puissant gouverneur de Californie\nIn fine, c’est de nouveau la Cour suprême, dominée par six juges républicains, qui va devoir trancher, ce qui inquiète les experts. \"La Cour est extremement déférente à l’égard du président et a pris ces dernières années une série de décisions qui renforcent son pouvoir\", affirme Elena Chachko. Kim Scheppele, de son côté, \"ne pense pas que les sages imposent des limites à l’autorité d’urgence, car ils sont en faveur d’une extension des prérogatives de l’exécutif\". Ce que cette professeur de droit voit comme très dangereux. \"Dans les autres pays, lorsque l’on a octroyé au chef de l’Etat un pouvoir illimité, ça a été la fin de la démocratie.\"",
