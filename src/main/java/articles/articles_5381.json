    "title": "‘Another Body’ documentary exposes harm of deepfake technology",
    "text": "Deepfake technology – the use of deep-learning artificial intelligence to create fake content online – creates a troubling portrait of consent in the digital age. A 2019 report by Sensity, a company that detects and monitors sexual deepfakes, found that 95% of all online deepfake videos are nonconsensual porn and 90% of those featured women. The Milstein Program in the College of Arts and Sciences, partnering with Cornell Cinema, will present [a free screening of the documentary “Another Body,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs3Wlf9BcEI) which focuses on the gendered implications of deepfake technology. The screening will be on Wednesday, February 7, at 7 p.m. at Cornell Cinema. This event is part of the [Science on Screens](https://scienceonscreen.org/) initiative, and will feature an introduction by Gili Vidan, assistant professor of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, as well as a post-show Q&A with one of the film’s directors. “Another Body” follows a college student's search for answers and justice after she discovers that the image of her face has been used without her consent in deepfake pornography. She joins with another student who has also been a target and they take the investigation into their own hands. \"I caught ‘Another Body’ at the Woodstock Film Festival, after its premiere at South by Southwest, and found it unforgettable – searing, urgent, and provocative,\" says Milstein Program director [Austin Bunn](https://pma.cornell.edu/austin-bunn), associate professor of performing & media arts. \"As deepfakes become increasingly commonplace, the film provides a look at the culture of the people behind them and asks why they do it. The answer is disturbing.\" Directors Sophie Compton and Reuban Hamlyn said that “we hope ‘Another Body’ will bolster efforts to rewrite the laws that govern the internet, and deepen people’s understanding of how online misogyny has very tangible impacts on our world.” This event is co-sponsored by the Departments of Science and Technology Studies and Performing and Media Arts (A&S).",

    "title": "Donald Trump said disabled people should just die, his nephew says | CBC Radio",
    "text": "The Current 19:07 Trump said disabled people should just die: nephew When Fred Trump III asked his uncle Donald Trump for money to help with his disabled son's medical care, he says the former U.S. president suggested letting the young man die instead.\nFred's son, William Trump, was born with a genetic mutation that altered his physical and cognitive development. The former president had contributed financially to William's care over the years, but mounting costs forced Fred to ask for more help in a 2020 phone call.\nIn his new book, All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way , Fred alleges that his uncle's response was: \"I don't know, he doesn't recognize you. Maybe you should just let him die and move down to Florida.\"\nFred was shocked at the response, and insisted that his son does recognize him.\n\"To this day, it's still hard to wrap my head around it,\" he told The Current's guest host Susan Bonner.\n\"I don't know how one human being could say that about anybody else. Least of all his grandnephew,\" he said.\nFred Trump III said his son William, 25, is living in a group home and doing well. (Submitted by Simon & Schuster) Fred said his uncle has never met William, who is now living in a group home and doing well medically.\n\"He's 25 years old now, an extremely wonderful young man. Everybody that he touches, they are the better for it,\" Fred said.\nAfter the former president was elected in 2016, Fred and his wife Lisa realized they could use their new connection to the Oval Office to attempt to help the disabled community. He said his cousin Ivanka Trump helped to set up a meeting with the then-president in early 2017, where Fred and a group of advocates made a pitch for better supports for people living with disabilities.\nFred Trump III, right, with his wife Lisa and son William. (Submitted by Simon & Schuster) Fred said his uncle seemed interested in what they had to say, and called him back into the Oval Office when the meeting had ended and everyone else had left.\n\"He just looked at me and said, 'Those people, the costs. Why don't they just die?'\" Fred said.\n\"That was the precursor to … what he said to me about his grandnephew, three years later.\"\nDonald Trump says reporter 'should stop using his disability to grandstand' Opinion Let us be boring: Disabled people are more than heroes or objects of your pity In a statement to The Washington Post , Donald Trump said he had helped Fred and William both financially, and through introductions to government and medical officials.\n\"I helped him so much, more than anyone else in his life, and this is the thanks I get,\" said the former president, who is contesting the U.S. presidential election as the Republican nominee in November, facing off against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\nThe statement did not respond to a question about Fred's allegations of what his uncle said about disabled people, the Washington Post said.\nBitter family fights Fred is the son of Donald's older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he described as a free spirit who eschewed the family real estate business to become an airline pilot.\nFred said that decision didn't sit well with Donald or Fred Jr.'s father, Fred Trump Sr., who \"constantly ridiculed\" him for it.\n\"Donald called him a glorified bus driver. I think that's pretty demeaning,\" Fred said.\nIf you can't trust your own uncle to do the right thing, how can the people of America trust him to take care of them if he's re-elected president?\n- Fred Trump III Fred Jr. died of a heart attack in 1981 after a struggle with alcoholism. After Fred Sr. died in 1999 after a battle with dementia, Fred and his sister Mary Trump expected to receive some portion of the inheritance that would have gone to their father.\nBut they discovered that the former president and his two living siblings at the time — Robert Trump and Maryanne Trump Barry — had convinced Fred Sr. to remove them from the will. An ensuing lawsuit was settled out of court.\n\"When I would ask for money from the fund that had been set up by Donald and his siblings, I was literally asking for my own money — I always looked at it that way,\" Fred said.\nDespite those conflicts, Fred said he and his uncle remained close over the years, even attending his inauguration.\n\"We were close. Donald was the first person to put a golf club in my hand ... even when my father was alive, he would take me places and we would do things,\" he said.\nFred Trump III has written about the incident in his book All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way. (Submitted by Simon & Schuster) When Mary released a sharply critical book about their uncle in 2020, Fred distanced himself from his sister's book, calling it a breach of the family's privacy.\nHe said he ultimately decided to write his own book not out of a desire for revenge, but as a way to speak up for the needs of people living with disabilities.\n\"The only way I could [do that] was to tell the story of my family. That's a very complex story, a sometimes cruel story, and yes … that story couldn't be told without telling about Donald,\" he said.\nA Trump voting for Harris Fred said he'd like to see better funding and training for the caregivers that help people living with disabilities and their families. He also wants more diverse housing supports, arguing that a one-size-fits-all model won't meet everyone's needs.\nWATCH | Kamala Harris vs. Donald Trump: How would it play out?: Kamala Harris vs. Donald Trump: How would it play out?\n1 month ago Duration 6:48\nWith a Harris vs. Trump election looking likely, The National’s Ian Hanomansing asks U.S. political insiders Cornell Belcher and Chris Cillizza to break down how the campaign could play out, and what a possible path to victory for Kamala Harris might look like. Fred said he didn't vote for his uncle in 2016 or 2020, instead casting his ballot for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, respectively. While his uncle never asked who he voted for, Fred has already made his mind up about this election.\n\"I am going to be voting for, endorsing and campaigning for Kamala Harris,\" he said, adding that he believes her administration, if elected, would \"advocate on behalf of people with disabilities.\"\nHe said his uncle has an ability to make people believe he's on their side, but can cast them aside once he gets what he wants.\n\"If you can't trust your own uncle to do the right thing, how can the people of America trust him to take care of them if he's re-elected president?\"",

    "text": "La DANA ha vuelto a activarse este viernes desde primera hora y ha empezado a descargar con fuerza en Andalucía. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) ha activado una alerta roja para el litoral de Huelva, donde se podrían dar acumulaciones de más de 140 litros por metro cuadrado en tan solo unas horas. En localidades como Cartaya ya se han acumulado más de 117 litros por metro cuadrado en menos de tres horas, de los cuales 70 en un hora. Las autoridades piden a los ciudadanos de la zona extremar precauciones. Para este viernes también hay activadas varias alertas amarillas en el sur de Cataluña, el norte de la Comunitat Valenciana y en Mallorca y Menorca ante el riesgo de que la DANA vuelva a causar lluvias torrenciales en estas zonas. En Cataluña, la alerta naranja se concentra en las comarcas del Montsià y Baix Ebre, que acumulan dos días consecutivos de lluvias extremas, ante la previsión de que caigan más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado durante esta jornada. Los modelos aún se muestran inciertos sobre cómo evolucionará esta DANA en los próximos días. Este episodio empezó ya el fin de semana pasado, se ha extendido durante todo esta semana y seguramente continuará de cara al puente de Todos los Santos y el fin de semana. A partir de ahí, aún no está muy claro cuándo acabarán definitivamente estas lluvias. Por ahora, todo apunta a que a principios de la semana que viene se debilitarán mucho y probablemente se vayan apaciguando con el tiempo. Aun así, dada la evolución errática de este fenómeno, aún es pronto para ponerle fecha final a este episodio que ha causado tantas lluvias torrenciales.",

    "text": "An American citizen has been charged in Arizona with making threatening online comments that followed what police describe as a \"religiously motivated terrorist attack\" in Australia a year ago in which six people died.\nQueensland police officers Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold and innocent bystander Alan Dare were fatally shot by Gareth Train, his brother Nathaniel Train and Nathanial's wife, Stacey Train, in an ambush at the Trains' remote property in the rural community of Wieambilla on December 12, 2022.\nFour officers had arrived at the property to investigate reports of a missing person. They walked into a hail of gunfire, police said at the time. Two officers managed to escape and raise the alarm.\nPolice killed the three Trains, who have been described as conspiracy theorists, during a six-hour siege.\nThe FBI said agents arrested 58-year-old Donald Day Jr near Heber Overgaard, Arizona, last Friday.\nAuthorities said a federal grand jury indicted Day on two counts of interstate threats. The indictment said that from about the beginning of 2022 until February 2, 2023, Day \"engaged in a course of conduct demonstrating a desire to incite violence and threaten a variety of groups and individuals including law enforcement and government authorities\".\nDay, who lives in the northeastern Arizona town of Heber, was remanded to custody after he appeared in a Phoenix court on Tuesday and faces a potential five-year prison sentence if convicted, according to Arizona prosecutors.\nThe FBI is still investigating Day's alleged motive.\n\"The attack involved advanced planning and preparation against law enforcement,\" Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Cheryl Scanlon said, referring to the Trains.\n\"We know that the offenders executed a religiously motivated terrorist attack in Queensland. They were motivated by a Christian extremist ideology.\"\nAustralian police allege Gareth Train began following the suspect on YouTube in May 2020. A year later, they were communicating directly.\n\"The man repeatedly sent messages containing Christian end-of-days ideology to Gareth and then later to Stacey,\" Scanlon said.\nFBI legal attache for Australia Nitiana Mann said the FBI was committed to assisting the Queensland Police Service in its investigation.\n\"The FBI has a long memory and an even longer reach. From Queensland, Australia, to the remote corners of Arizona,\" Mann said.\n\"The FBI and QPS worked jointly and endlessly to bring this man to justice, and he will face the crimes he is alleged to have perpetrated.\"\n ",

    "text": "Con la posibilidad de realizar una escapada al exterior en un contexto de precios baratos afuera, Latinoamérica tiene miles de destinos para descubrir. Entre ellos figura Puno, en Perú.\nAdemás de ser el hogar del imponente lago Titicaca, Puno es también una ciudad llena de misticismo e historia milenaria que, cada febrero, se transforma en un escenario de color, música y devoción con la Festividad de la Virgen de la Candelaria, que reúne a turistas de todo el mundo que buscan conocer y ser parte de una de las celebraciones religiosas más importantes de Sudamérica.\nLa Festividad de la Virgen de la Candelaria se caracteriza por ser una gran fiesta con danzas, concursos, pasacalles, mucho color y fervor religioso en la que participan unos 40 000 danzantes y 200 bandas musicales. Se remonta a la época colonial, y tiene como raíces las tradiciones católicas y elementos simbólicos de la cosmovisión andina. Por su importancia cultural y religiosa en el 2014 fue declarada Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad por la Unesco.\nLas celebraciones se extienden durante dos semanas, en las que miles de danzantes salen a las calles vestidos con prendas típicas con mucho color, brillos y finos bordados, y unas llamativas botas con cascabeles que suenan a cada paso. Ellos, con su ritmo contagiante y alegría desbordante, bailan por horas en honor a la virgen y se ganan los aplausos de la multitud que admira sus incansables pasos de baile.\nEl 2 de febrero, todos se reúnen en el atrio de la Iglesia de San Juan Bautista, donde se lleva a cabo la tradicional procesión de la imagen de la virgen por las principales calles de la ciudad, acompañada de música, danzas y una emotiva participación de las familias, quienes entregan oraciones y peticiones.\nUno de los momentos más esperados son los dos grandes concursos de danzas autóctonas y el de trajes de luces, que tienen lugar en un estadio de la zona y que son transmitidos a nivel nacional. Además, el tradicional pasacalle reúne a cerca de 200 conjuntos folclóricos, en el que participan comunidades quechuas y aimaras de toda la región.\nEs así que Puno se convierte en el escenario de la festividad más grande de Perú en la que la Virgen de la Candelaria, patrona de Puno, es venerada por los habitantes de la región, quienes año tras año renuevan su fe y celebran su identidad cultural.\nDescubrí los tesoros de Puno\nSi planeas visitar Puno en febrero, prepárate para vivir una experiencia inolvidable en una de las celebraciones más emblemáticas del Perú. Aprovecha tu estadía en esta región para conocer otros destinos importantes como el lago Titicaca, el lago navegable más alto del mundo (3810 m. s. n. m.).\nAhí podrás conocer las impresionantes islas flotantes como la de los Uros, una población que ha construido sus casas y embarcaciones con totora, una planta acuática de la zona; Taquile, una isla con vistas extraordinarias del lago y cuyo arte textil fue declarado Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad; y la isla de Amantaní, una de las más extensas del Titicaca, donde puedes vivir la fabulosa experiencia del turismo comunitario que permitirá conocer las costumbres y tradiciones de sus pobladores.\nCómo llegar a Puno\nPuno es una gran opción para visitar en Perú. Está a una hora y media de vuelo desde Lima al aeropuerto internacional de la ciudad de Juliaca, que está a 50 minutos de distancia de Puno. Distintas aerolíneas llegan a este destino exótico que cuenta con atractivos de todo tipo.

    "text": "AUGUSTA — A Benton man who allegedly threatened to slit a woman’s throat and run her over with a vehicle withdrew no-contest pleas to domestic violence-related charges on Thursday when a judge rejected a proposed plea deal.\nChief District Court Judge Brent Davis made the decision after hearing from the alleged victim that the agreed-upon sentence of 90 days behind bars was not enough.\n“What this man did to me, in our relationship, has tortured me,” the woman said, through tears. “I have nightmares of him beating me. I don’t think three months is justice enough, for me. It has been hard to cope with this. I’m in therapy because of what he’s done to me. I just want you to take that into consideration.”\nChristopher S. Groves, 28, of Benton, initially pleaded no contest to charges of violating conditions of release, domestic violence assault and domestic violence criminal threatening Thursday at the Capital Judicial Center in Augusta. Other related charges, including domestic violence criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, theft and two other counts of violating conditions of release, were dismissed as part of a proposed plea deal.\nProsecutor Shannon Flaherty, an assistant district attorney, said a woman told police that Groves, in a May of 2023 incident in Benton, threatened to slit her throat if she tried to leave and later threatened to run her over with a vehicle and kill her. She said he threw her during an argument, which a Kennebec County Sheriff’s Office investigator said left a bump on her head.\nThe newspaper is not identifying the woman because its policy is not to identify victims of alleged domestic violence without their consent.\nIn June of 2023 Groves allegedly again threatened to run the woman over, at the Cumberland Farms store in Fairfield, while he was on bail with conditions including that he not have contact with her.\nA plea deal reached between state prosecutors and Groves and his attorney, James Langworthy, would have sentenced Groves to three years imprisonment but with all but 90 days of that time suspended, and two years probation. That would have meant he’d serve 90 days behind bars if he complied with the terms of his probation, but could have faced the full three-year sentence if he violated probation.\nIn response, Judge Davis called both attorneys into his chambers, where he apparently rejected the plea deal.\nGroves, after meeting with Langworthy, was allowed to withdraw his pleas of not contesting the charges. The case is scheduled to continue in court in a July 18 conference.\nComments are not available on this story.\n Chelsea man sentenced in Augusta machete attack",

    "text": "(Arv) Venezia 5 lug. 2024 - “Il riconoscimento ottenuto dall’Unesco è la conclusione di un lungo percorso, che ha richiesto un impegno straordinario dell’Ente Parco e di tutto il territorio di riferimento. Abbiamo raggiunto un traguardo importante, che da un lato consentirà ai Colli Euganei di essere protagonisti di un percorso di rilancio economico e valorizzazione turistico-ambientale, dall’altro rappresenta un’ulteriore spinta verso la realizzazione di un progetto di sviluppo territoriale sostenibile. L’Unesco ci ha dato l’occasione di cogliere nuove opportunità, grazie alle quali i Colli Euganei potranno essere sempre più incisivi nella realizzazione di resilienza alle sfide ambientali, sociali ed economiche a cui siamo chiamati. Oggi è anche arrivata la conferma dell’impegno messo in campo dalla Regione sul fronte della valorizzazione a livello internazionale e della salvaguardia dei propri patrimoni naturalistici e culturali: i Colli sono un unicum che racchiude habitat e specie uniche nel loro genere e che ne fa un tesoro di biodiversità. Oggi non hanno vinto solo i colli Euganei ma ha vinto tutto il Veneto”. Queste le parole di soddisfazione con cui il Presidente del Consiglio regionale del Veneto Roberto Ciambetti ha commentato l’esito della 36^ Sessione dell’International Coordinating Council of the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, svoltasi in mattinata ad Agadir in Marocco, nel corso della quale i Colli Euganei sono stati proclamati Riserva della Biosfera MAB UNESCO. Quest’ultimo è il programma scientifico intergovernativo avviato dall’UNESCO nel 1971 per promuovere, su base scientifica, un rapporto equilibrato tra uomo e ambiente attraverso la tutela della biodiversità e le buone pratiche di Sviluppo Sostenibile. Attualmente sono 748 le Riserve riconosciute dall’Unesco, in 134 Paesi: 20 sono i siti che si trovano in Italia, tra cui il Monte Grappa e il Delta del Po. Il processo di candidatura dei Colli Euganei a Riserva MAB Unesco è stato avviato nell’ottobre 2021 e l’area proposta a Riserva della Biosfera interessa una superficie di 34mila ettari, coinvolgendo l’intero territorio dei 15 Comuni del Parco regionale dei Colli Euganei.

    "text": "Menacé de mort pour avoir simplement demandé des informations. Dans la commune de Magny-les-Hameaux, au cœur de la vallée de Chevreuse, Pierre-Louis Brière a été obligé de quitter précipitamment sa maison. La raison ? Le père de famille est accusé de « racisme » et d’« islamophobie » après s’être renseigné sur la construction d’une mosquée dans sa ville,\nrévèle Le Figaro.\nA LIREEssonne : un sanglier éventré découvert sur le portail d’une mosquée\nEn novembre, la mairie achète, auprès de l’agglomération de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, un terrain pour y faire\nconstruire une mosquée qui serait un lieu « d’apprentissage de l’arabe et de pratique du culte musulman », indique l’association des musulmans de Magny-les-Hameaux (A2MH). Pourtant, le maire de gauche Bertrand Houillon affirme qu’il n’est pas prévu qu’une mosquée soit construite alors que sur le site de A2MH, il est fait mention d’un « lieu de pratique musulman ».\n« Vous pouvez chialler (sic), on va vous remplacer »\nDe manière générale, cette association ne donne pas beaucoup d’informations sur son projet. «Si c’est flou, c’est qu’il y a un loup », assure Pierre-Louis, encarté chez LR et qui travaille lui-même à l’agglomération de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. Le père de famille décide alors de créer un « comité citoyen de Magny-les-Hameaux » pour alerter les riverains. Il réclame une « information exhaustive » sur le sujet et une consultation des habitants.\nTrès rapidement, il se voit\nmenacer sur les réseaux sociaux pour avoir lancé ce comité. « Vous pouvez chialler (sic), on va vous remplacer », « Nous, les Maghrébins et Noirs, sommes ceux qui détenons le pouvoir », « J’aurais tout lu avec ce comité de dégénérés », etc. D’autres commentaires qualifient les adhérents au comité de « racistes », de « paranos islamophobes », et d’« amicale des joyeux nazis » avec des « tronches d’aryens sympathiques ». Des internautes envoient même une photo de deux hommes tenant des têtes de mannequins décapités, accompagnée de l’inscription : « Daesh en vacances. » Le nom de famille de Pierre-Louis et son numéro de téléphone sont ensuite largement diffusés. Des personnes anonymes l’appelleront plusieurs fois pour le menacer de le tuer. C’est à ce moment que lui et sa famille ont décidé de quitter leur domicile.",
