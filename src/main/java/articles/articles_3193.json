    "text": "Singer Morrissey claims guitarist Johnny Marr ignored a propped reunion tour for The Smiths. (Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com) (Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com)\nBy Christopher Burch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Morrissey, longtime lead singer for the band The Smiths , recently explained why a proposed 2025 reunion tour won’t happen. And it isn’t because he didn’t want to do one.\nIn a statement posted to the singer’s website Thursday, Morrissey alleges he accepted an offer for the band to tour in 2025 — but guitarist Johnny Marr ignored it.\n“In June 2024 AEG Entertainment Group made a lucrative offer to both Morrissey and Marr to tour worldwide as ‘The Smiths’ throughout 2025,” the statement read. “Morrissey said yes to the offer; Marr ignored the offer.”\nThe Smiths will not be following in the footsteps of fellow British rock band Oasis, which announced a reunion tour earlier this week.\nWhile it appears there won’t be a Smiths reunion, those who love music from Morrissey and Marr will still have chances to see them live.\n“Morrissey undertakes a largely sold out tour of the USA in November,” the statement continued. “Marr continues to tour as a special guest to New Order.”\nThe popular rock band was formed in England back in 1982 by Morrissey, Marr, Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce. The band broke up in 1987. Morrissey, 65, and Marr, 60, have been at odds hardly spoken since the breakup, according to Ultimate Classic Rock .\nMarr — who has rejected the idea of a reunion and taken jabs at Morrissey’s political stance over the years — has yet to comment on the statement.\nThe Smiths are know for hits like “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out,” “Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now,” “Half a Person,” and more.\nMore entertainment coverage: Legendary rock band to release its first project in 16 years Legendary punk band cancels upcoming tour due to ‘an unforeseen family circumstance’ Legendary rock band adds more shows to reunion tour due to ‘unprecedented demand’ Legendary classic rock singer backtracks, will play biggest hits on new tour Netflix star dead at 45 just hours after bidding farewell to fans in video Our journalism needs your support.

    "text": "Hagerstown Police are expecting to charge a North Hagerstown High School student as an adult after a loaded gun was found in the 16-year-old's backpack during the school day on Thursday, authorities said.\nNo one was injured, said Erin Anderson, spokeswoman for Washington County Public Schools.\nAsked if the student planned to show the handgun off or if there were \"evil intentions,\" Hagerstown Police Lt. Rebecca Fetchu texted, \"We don't believe there were 'evil intentions' but obviously we take having a gun in a school setting very seriously.\"\nAnnapolis lawmakers talk juvenile crime. Is upping school attendance part of the solution?\nAnderson said \"other individuals in the school reported to administrators that they believed there was unlawful activity in the building.\"\n\"The weapon was discovered after reports were received by school staff that led our administrators and School Safety and Security Assistants to search the student’s backpack,\" North High Principal Mike Chilcutt wrote in an emailed message addressed to North High \"families and staff.\"\n\"Upon discovering the gun, the School Resource Officer secured the weapon and removed the student from the building. The student will not be returning to school while this matter is being investigated,\" Chilcutt wrote.\nAnderson confirmed the accuracy of the emailed message Chilcutt shared with the school community.\nSchool resource officers provided by local law enforcement Local law enforcement, in this case Hagerstown Police, provide school resource officers in several public schools in Washington County.\nAlmost a year ago, under new Superintendent David Sovine, the public school system hired security assistants due to an increase in behavioral issues.\nAnderson said from the time the student was removed from the classroom, to taking him to a private area to be searched and removing him from the building took about 5 minutes in total.\nThis occurred while students were in class and not during the change period between classes, Anderson said.\nThe school did not go on lockdown and proceeded with its normal dismissal at the end of the school day, she said.\nHagerstown Police confirm gun was loaded The incident occurred during the afternoon at one of the community's largest schools. North High is at 1200 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\"With our emergency protocols, we do not initiate a lockdown unless there is an active threat within the building, like an active shooter,\" Anderson said.\nFetchu, spokesperson for Hagerstown Police, said she did not have any details regarding where the gun came from. She confirmed it was loaded.\nHagerstown Police were not releasing the student's name as of late Thursday afternoon.\nFetchu wrote that school staff and the school resource officer did an \"excellent job\" responding to the incident.\nChilcutt, who has several years experience as a principal for the school system, wrote in the email, \"It is a heavy responsibility to share these details with our school community. As the principal, the reality of this potential danger to our students and staff is difficult to fully comprehend. It is clear, thanks to the students and staff who stepped forward, that unlawful activity will not be tolerated at North High.\n\"I recognize this incident will bring up various emotions from our students, staff, and families. Our counseling team is always available if students would like to discuss any concerns,\" he wrote.\nChilcutt ended the email with, \"The safety of our students is our highest responsibility. I ask you to encourage your child to quickly report any potentially dangerous situation to a trusted adult in our school.\"\nSovine, \"in the interest of providing accurate information and with the hope of preventing a similar incident in the future,\" shared a written update late Thursday afternoon with WCPS families about the situation.\n\"It is critical that we work collectively as a community to keep our schools safe,\" Sovine wrote.\n\"Our students, staff, families and community members must quickly report any potential dangers to the school and/or local law enforcement. Please assure your children they are doing the right thing by speaking up for school safety,\" Sovine wrote.\nBecome a subscriber Install the Herald-Mail app Sign up for our email newsletters",
