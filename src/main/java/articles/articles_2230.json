These complaints are regularly monitored at the state-level by the district-wise nominated nodal officers, he said. All complaints lodged by the teachers and registered are simultaneously visible to the district education officer, director of primary and secondary education, director of mid-day meal scheme, and additional chief secretary of the department, he added. Under the e-Shiksha Kosh system, the DEO has been assigned the responsibility of resolving the complaints and uploading compliance reports on the portal, so that the additional chief secretary's public grievance cell can periodically review them.Only inter-district matters will be considered at the state-level in very special circumstances.The letter stated that teachers trying to contact officials at the secretariat regarding the transfer issues disrupt departmental activities. Visiting the secretariat also causes personal difficulties for the teachers, it added.",

These are Ukraine’s steps towards how Ukraine can force Russia to the negotiating table and finally to peace.\nBiden thanked the president of Ukraine for presenting the victory plan and announced that the United States would continue to support Ukraine.\n“Russia won’t win, Ukraine will win, and we’ll stand by you all the way,” Biden said when meeting with Zelensky in front of television cameras.\nZelenskyi replied that he was grateful for the support shown by the United States and that it has stood by Ukraine.\nThe details of President Zelensky’s victory plan are still shrouded in mystery, but it is known in advance that it includes increasing Western arms aid, removing restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, and promises to Ukraine that it will be able to join Western institutions such as NATO.\nPresident Biden announced on Thursday, the US will give Ukraine an aid package of almost 8 billion dollars. The aid package includes, among other things, JASSM long-range missiles.\nBiden also said he would strengthen Ukraine’s position in future negotiations by speeding up the release of aid Ukraine has received before January, when his presidency ends.\nTo Zelensky the visit is overshadowed by US domestic politics, as well as the skeptical attitude of experts towards the Ukraine peace plan.\nThe Republican Party of the United States is protested that Zelenskyi has met almost exclusively with representatives of the Democratic Party. Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and representative of the Republican Party Mike Johnson called Zelenskyi’s actions “election influence”.\nThe experts and authorities familiar with the profit plan, on the other hand, are have said that the victory plan does not bring anything new to the table and the proposals contained in it have been on Ukraine’s agenda for a long time.\n#Russian #attack #Zelenskyi #meet #Biden #White #House",

    "text": "24/12/2023 - 13:01\nRAFAH, 24 DEZ (ANSA) – Por Sami al-Ajrami – Os últimos 650 cristãos que ainda vivem na Faixa de Gaza terão um Natal sem luz, sob as bombas e com o único conforto das próprias recordações.\nEsse número era de 15 mil no início dos anos 2000, antes de o Hamas assumir o poder no enclave palestino. Naquela época, uma grande árvore de Natal era exposta na Praça do Militar Desconhecido e atraía multidões de cristãos e até de muçulmanos.\nTestemunhas locais dizem que a praça está agora irreconhecível.\nA grama deu lugar a covas abertas por escavadeiras militares, montes de terra e rastros deixados por tanques, enquanto nas proximidades é possível ver os restos daquela que foi a sede da Assembleia Legislativa, explodida em um bombardeio israelense.\nSó os mais velhos se lembram daqueles anos porque o Hamas proibiu a exibição pública de árvores de Natal, que desde então foram colocadas apenas dentro de instituições cristãs.\nSegundo fontes locais, o shopping da capital do enclave também está em ruínas. Era em um famoso restaurante do local que, normalmente, depois das celebrações de Natal em um centro cultural juvenil cristão, os fiéis continuavam a noite. O shopping é agora uma pilha de ruínas enegrecidas.\nNa pequena comunidade católica de Gaza (bem como na de Belém, na Cisjordânia), a missa da meia-noite será rezada como manda a tradição, mas sem qualquer festa. Segundo as informações disponíveis, há cerca de 10 freiras na paróquia, mas o pároco está retido na Cisjordânia.\nPor isso, as noites de Natal passadas perto da igreja ortodoxa de São Porfírio, símbolo da milenar presença cristã na Faixa de Gaza, ou nas ruas características da Cidade Velha, permanecem restritas à memória. A própria igreja de São Porfírio sofreu danos em uma estrutura lateral durante um bombardeio israelense, enquanto a mesquita Al-Omari (outro marco na história da cidade) foi seriamente danificada.\nUm Natal marcado pelo luto pelas mais de 20 mil vítimas do conflito em Gaza, às quais podem se somar mais 10 mil desaparecidos sob os escombros.

    "title": "What does Pope Francis want LGBTQ Catholics to do?",
    "text": "The Vatican declared in 2021 that same-sex relationships cannot be blessed because God “cannot bless sin.” And now less than three years later, Pope Francis has authorized blessings for same-sex couples. What exactly does Pope Francis want LGBTQ Catholics to do in response to his shocking declaration?\nThe Pope has a huge responsibility to clarify his hopes and dreams for LGBTQ Catholics, especially since “some Catholic bishops in Africa, Poland and elsewhere say they will not implement the new Vatican policy allowing blessings for same-sex couples.”\nDoes the Pope want these couples to view homosexual behavior as less sinful than fornication and adultery? Does he perhaps want them to celebrate their same-sex desires, or instead, turn away from those ungodly desires as other same-sex attracted individuals have done? Does the Pope pray that LGBTQ Catholics will repent of their homosexual behavior?\nWhile Pope Francis has not specifically affirmed same-sex marriage, he has completely blurred the lines by declaring that priests can now “bless” same-sex relationships. Steven Millies explains that the Pope “is oriented toward caring for and ministering to people rather than teaching doctrine. The word ‘pastoral’ appears 20 times in the Pope's declaration.”\nBut how does this “pastoral” approach compare with the holy pastoral approach used by Jesus and the Apostle Paul? Did Jesus or Paul ever bless adulterers or those persisting in homosexual behavior? Of course not. Jesus and Paul never blessed or coddled people with comforting words when they were planning to continue committing sexual sin.\nChrist’s first sermon began with the word, “Repent” (Mark 1:15). Repentance involves a “change of mind” where you renounce your sin as you intend by the grace of God to move in a godly direction. The Messiah invited everyone who repented to “believe the good news” (Mark 1:15).\nIn the familiar story about the woman caught in adultery, Jesus did not condemn her but simply told her, “Go now and leave your life of sin” (John 8:11). Telling adulterers or those engaging in homosexual behavior to leave their life of sin is a far cry from giving them a blessing. It is actually unloving to tell a person that he or she can enjoy God’s blessing while persisting in sexual sin.\nThe Apostle Paul, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, delivered a beautiful description of repentance in his second letter to the church in Corinth. Sexual immorality, among other sins, had surfaced in the church. Paul wrote: “Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done” (2 Corinthians 7:10-11).\nPope Francis should encourage priests to utilize that insightful passage when counseling same-sex couples, as well as those engaged in fornication or adultery. After all, apart from repentance, there is no forgiveness.\nPope Francis seems to understand that genuine repentance leads to a change of behavior. As reported last year, “ Pope Francis Calls on Christians to ‘Repent and Modify our Lifestyles’ to Save the Planet .” The Pope needs to be just as clear when calling people to repent and turn away from sin, whether it be homosexual behavior or any other sin.\nUnfortunately, the Pope has led Catholics to now wonder where he stands on the issue of homosexual behavior. Many Catholics and others view the Pope's stunning declaration as a signal that Francis approves of homosexual behavior between two consenting adults who care deeply for one another. Does the Pope want these couples to continue down the course they are on, or not? Does he believe their immortal souls are in danger apart from repentance, or not? (see 1 Corinthians 6:9-11).\nA Catholic woman in Argentina voiced what some other Catholics are most likely thinking in response to the Pope’s declaration: “Yes, I agree with what the Pope said, the Church has to modernize. We cannot continue living 2000 years behind. The world has changed, it is changing. It seems perfect to me. Everyone does with their life what they want.”\nTen years ago I penned a CP op-ed titled: “ Will Pope Francis Balance Compassion and Repentance? ” I wrote, “Pope Francis says he wants to find a ‘new balance’ in the Catholic church as it relates to hot-button moral issues in society and the church. But as the Pope attempts to tweak the spiritual focus, will he do what Jesus did in balancing compassion and repentance?”\nSadly, the biblical command to repent is greatly lacking in the Pope's emotional appeal to bless same-sex couples. On the heels of the Vatican’s announcement less than a week before Christmas, Pope Francis “ urged Vatican bureaucrats to avoid ‘rigid ideological positions’ that prevent them from understanding today’s reality.”\nSexual boundaries in Scripture are rigid because God created sex to take place within the confines of marriage between a man and a woman. Fornication, adultery, and homosexual behavior are clearly out of bounds and deeply offensive to God. “All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body” (1 Corinthians 6:18).\nPope Francis said that we are called to follow the light that leads us “at times along unexplored paths and new roads.” What new roads is he talking about? Many LGBTQ Catholics now assume these new roads include an eventual acceptance and affirmation of homosexual behavior between consenting adults in a committed relationship. But is that what the Pope wants to see happen, or not?\nRather than giving the impression that he affirms the behavior of those who have “exchanged the truth of God for a lie,” (Romans 1:25) Pope Francis could rely upon God’s grace to rise above the spirit of the age. After all, “the grace of God that brings salvation … teaches us to say ‘No’ to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age” (Titus 2:11-12). There is nothing godly or self-controlled about pornography, fornication, adultery, or homosexual behavior.\nThe Holy Spirit has never led anyone, including the Pope, to bless sin. Pope Francis made that decision all on his own.",

Le 22 octobre, à l'entrée des communes du Tarn, les panneaux sont retournés, avec un mot d'ordre revendiqué quatre jours plus tard : \"On marche sur la tête\". L'idée de ces jeunes agriculteurs se propage dans tout le pays, pour dénoncer un monde qui marche sur la tête et tape sur les nerfs des agriculteurs.\nLa coupe est pleine En novembre, puis décembre, ont lieu des manifestations locales isolées. Parmi les griefs des manifestants, il y a la maladie des bovins ou encore la réglementation européenne. La coupe est pleine. La nouvelle année et le remaniement n'apportent aucune solution. Alors cette fois-ci, quand le mouvement reprend du Sud-Ouest il y a dix jours, il se répand. Il n'y a plus de répit. Les agriculteurs tiennent le piquet, même la nuit. La jeunesse semble déjà porter le poids trop lourd des années, quand leurs parents tirent sur la corde, rongés par la culpabilité. Désormais, les agriculteurs passent à l'action dans 85 départements. Plusieurs syndicats appellent à un blocus de Paris.",
