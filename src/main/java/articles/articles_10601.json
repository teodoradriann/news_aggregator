    "title": "American Express Blue Business Cash Card: Elevated rewards without the complex redemption structure - Top World News Today",
    "text": "Our take: The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card offers 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%), with no annual fee, making it lucrative for small businesses. However, businesses exceeding the $50,000 spending cap per calendar year will earn a reduced cashback rate of 1% on the remainder, and it may offer fewer perks compared to some other business credit cards . Card type: Business To view rates and fees of the American Express Blue Business Cash Card, see this page The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is designed to simplify and reward everyday business spending. It boasts a generous welcome bonus of $250 statement credit after you make $3,000 in purchases on your card in your first 3 months of card membership. Plus, earn an additional $250 statement credit after spending an additional $10,000 within the first year. Beyond this welcome bonus, the card earns 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%). One of its key highlights is the absence of an annual fee, making it an attractive choice for businesses looking to maximize rewards without incurring additional costs. Its cash-back rewards structure is also ideal for those who want to earn rewards without researching the best way to use them. Cashback is simply deposited as a statement credit, eliminating the need to figure out the best redemption option. Moreover, the card extends various benefits beyond its cashback rewards, including secondary rental car insurance , access to the Amex Global Assist hotline, extended warranty and purchase protection. Cardholders can also take advantage of Amex Offers, which provide discounts and savings opportunities with select merchants. The combination of its simple rewards system, lack of an annual fee and practical perks makes the American Express Blue Business Cash Card a solid choice for businesses seeking a no-frills yet rewarding credit card. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is an excellent fit for small to mid-sized businesses looking for simplicity and value in their credit card rewards. It caters well to businesses with diverse spending needs, offering a flat 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%), eliminating the hassle of dealing with rotating categories or complex redemption processes. This card provides a straightforward and cost-effective solution for entrepreneurs and business owners seeking a streamlined approach to earning rewards on everyday operational expenses. Overall, the Blue Business Cash Card is a solid option for those seeking uncomplicated yet rewarding cash-back benefits at no annual fee. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card may not be the best choice for businesses with annual spending exceeding $50,000. That’s because once the limit is reached, the cash-back rate drops to 1%. This may not be as lucrative for businesses with substantial expenses. Furthermore, businesses with significant spending on categories like travel might find better value in a travel rewards card that better caters to their needs. Those who shouldn’t get the Amex Blue Business Cash Card include business owners who either travel internationally or use their cards for spending originating abroad. The card imposes a 2.7% of each transaction after conversion to US dollars, making it a poor choice for this purpose. Lastly, the Amex Blue Business Cash isn’t the best choice for business owners who want to earn flexible rewards that can be maximized for premium award travel. Cash-back rewards can’t be optimized beyond their set value. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card has a straightforward rewards structure. New card members earn a $250 statement credit after you make $3,000 in purchases on your card in your first 3 months of card membership, plus another $250 after spending an additional $10,000 within the first year. While this is quite a steep spending requirement, it’s pretty attainable for most small businesses. In addition to the combined $500 in statement credits, the card earns 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%). All other spending beyond this threshold earns 1% cashback. This earn rate is great for businesses that want to earn elevated rewards on all purchases without having to track numerous category bonuses across multiple credit cards. Redeeming rewards with the American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is about as straightforward as it gets. Rewards are automatically applied as a statement credit within two billing statements following a purchase. This automatic redemption is great for those who seek simplicity rather than complicated redemption structures. While there’s value in earning points through a program like Amex Membership Rewards, maximizing the full value of these points requires a steep learning curve. Not everyone has the time, patience or desire to learn how best to use these points – even if doing so can open up significantly better redemption opportunities. With cash-back rewards that automatically post as statement credits, there’s no effort required whatsoever. To view rates and fees of the American Express Blue Business Cash Card, see this page If the American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card isn’t quite your cup of tea, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. We’ve chosen two cards that you might want to consider, which offer comparable rewards: The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express are both small business cards that offer similar reward structures and benefits. Both cards earn 2X rewards on the first $50,000 in spending every calendar year, then 1X after. The Blue Business Plus earns valuable Amex Membership Rewards points, while the Blue Business Cash earns cash back. Both cards have no annual fee and offer a welcome bonus for new cardmembers. The Blue Business Plus offers 15,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $3,000 in eligible purchases on the Card within your first 3 months of Card Membership. The Blue Business Cash is more generous, with up to $500 in cash back. Overall, the Blue Business Cash is great for straightforward cash-back rewards, while the Blue Business Plus is better for earning and maximizing travel rewards. The Capital One Spark Miles for Business is a great alternative to the American Express Blue Business card if you want travel benefits and unlimited flexible rewards. Similar to the Blue Business Cash, the Spark Miles for Business card earns a flat rate on all spending: 2 miles per $1 spent on all purchases, without limits. Cardholders also earn 5 miles per $1 spent on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. The card also offers a welcome bonus of 50,000 miles if you spend $4,500 in first 3 months. These rewards are worth $500 when redeemed for direct travel purchases or you can transfer them to one of 18 airline or hotel transfer partners for even more value. The Spark Miles for Business has a $95 annual fee, which is waived the first year , presenting a great opportunity to test the card out risk-free for a year to decide if it’s worth keeping long-term . The card also includes a $100 travel credit towards Global Entry or TSA Precheck application fees every four years. Foreign transaction fees are also waived, making this an ideal option for business owners who travel often or spend significantly with merchants located abroad. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card can be a solid choice for small business owners seeking simplicity in their rewards. The card suits those who want to earn elevated cash-back rewards on everyday business expenses without tracking category bonuses or worrying about annual fees. Its 2% cash-back rewards structure can be significant for businesses with varied spending. Furthermore, the card’s $500 welcome bonus is generous for a cash-back rewards card, providing a nice incentive for new cardholders. However, the card’s 2% cash-back bonus is restricted to the first $50,000 spent per calendar year. Beyond this threshold, cardholders will earn just 1% cash back. Thus, the card may not be ideal for businesses with expenses exceeding $50,000 or those whose spending habits fall into specific categories. For example, if you spend substantially on shipping and advertising every year, you might be better off with an Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. The card earns 3x points per $1 (up to $150,000 combined) spent on shipping purchases, internet, cable, phone, and advertising with social media sites and search engines. Additionally, if your business involves travel or spending originating abroad, the Amex Blue Business Cash isn’t the most cost-effective choice. The card incurs a 2.7% foreign transaction fee, which negates the value of the cash back earned. Moreover, businesses requiring more extensive travel perks and protections might be better off with a premium business card like the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card requires good to excellent credit, making it somewhat hard to get approved. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is a cash-back rewards card for small businesses. The credit limit for an American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card will vary depending on your creditworthiness, income and business history. As a result, the credit limit will vary by customer.

    "title": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard out of prison years after persuading boyfriend to kill her abusive mother",
    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard, the Missouri woman who persuaded an online boyfriend to kill her mother after she had forced her to pretend for years that she was suffering from leukemia, muscular dystrophy and other serious illnesses, was released Thursday from prison on parole.\nBlanchard was released early in the day from the Chillicothe Correctional Center, said Karen Pojmann, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Corrections. Blanchard was granted parole after serving 85% of her original sentence, Pojmann said.\nBlanchard’s case sparked national tabloid interest after reports emerged that her mother, Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, who was slain in 2015, had essentially kept her daughter prisoner, forcing her to use a wheelchair and feeding tube.\nIt turned out that Gypsy Blanchard, now 32, was perfectly healthy, not developmentally delayed as her friends had always believed. Her mother had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological disorder in which parents or caregivers seek sympathy through the exaggerated or made-up illnesses of their children, said her trial attorney, Michael Stanfield.\n“People were constantly telling Dee Dee what a wonderful mother she was, and Dee Dee was getting all of this attention,” he said.\nThrough the ruse, the mother and daughter met country star Miranda Lambert and received charitable donations, a trip to Disney World and even a home near Springfield from Habitat for Humanity.\nStanfield said Gypsy Blanchard’s mother was able to dupe doctors by telling them her daughter’s medical records had been lost in Hurricane Katrina. If they asked too many questions, she just found a new physician, shaving the girl’s head to back up her story. Among the unnecessary procedures Gypsy Blanchard underwent was the removal of her salivary glands. Her mother convinced doctors it was necessary by using topical anesthetic to cause drooling.\nGypsy Blanchard, who had little schooling or contact with anyone but her mother, also was misled, especially when she was younger, Stanfield said.\n“The doctors seem to confirm everything that you’re being told. The outside world is telling you that your mother is a wonderful, loving, caring person. What other idea can you have?” Stanfield said.\nBut then the abuse became more physical, Stanfield said. Gypsy testified that her mother beat her and chained her to a bed. Slowly, Gypsy also was beginning to understand that she wasn’t as sick as her mom said.\n“I wanted to be free of her hold on me,” Gypsy testified at the 2018 trial of her former boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn of Big Bend, Wisconsin, who is serving a life sentence in the killing. She went on to add: “I talked him into it.”\nWhen she took the stand at his trial, prosecutors already had cut her a deal because of the abuse she had endured. In exchange for pleading guilty in 2016 to second-degree murder, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The first-degree murder charge she initially faced would have meant a life term.\n“Nick was so in love with her and so obsessed with her that he would do anything,” Godejohn’s trial attorney Dewayne Perry argued in court, saying his client has autism and was manipulated.\nProsecutors, however, argued that he was motivated by sex and a desire to be with Gypsy Blanchard, whom he met on a Christian dating website.\nAccording to the probable cause statement, Gypsy Blanchard supplied the knife and hid in a bathroom while Godejohn repeatedly stabbed her mother. The two ultimately made their way by bus to Wisconsin, where they were arrested.\n“Things are not always as they appear,” said Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott as the strange revelations began to emerge.\nEven Gypsy’s age was a lie. Her mother had said she was younger to make it easier to perpetuate the fraud, and got away with it because Gypsy was so small: just 4 feet, 11 inches (150 centimeters) tall.\nLaw enforcement was initially so confused that the original court documents listed three different ages for her, with the youngest being 19. She was 23.\nGreene County Prosecutor Dan Patterson described it as “one of the most extraordinary and unusual cases we have seen.”\nStanfield recalled that the first time he met Gypsy, she got out of breath walking the 75 yards (69 meters) from the elevator to the room where he talked to her. He described her as malnourished and physically frail.\n“I can honestly say I’ve rarely had a client who looks exceedingly better after doing a fairly long prison sentence,” Stanfield said. “Prison is generally not a place where you become happy and healthy. And I say that because, to me, that’s kind of the evidence to the rest of the world as to just how bad what Gypsy was going through really was.”\nGypsy Blanchard later said it wasn’t until her arrest that she realized how healthy she was. But it took time. Eventually, she got married while behind bars to Ryan Scott Anderson, now 37, of Saint Charles, Louisiana.\nThe bizarre case was the subject of the 2017 HBO documentary “Mommy Dead and Dearest,” the 2019 Hulu miniseries “The Act” and an upcoming Lifetime docuseries “The Prison Confession of Gypsy Rose Blanchard.” Daytime television psychologist “Dr. Phil” McGraw interviewed her from prison. The novel “Darling Rose Gold” draws upon the story for its premise and Blanchard’s own account, “Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom” is set for publication next month.\nAmid the media storm, Pojmann, of the corrections department, said no in-person coverage of her release was allowed “in the interest of protecting safety, security and privacy.”",

Sin embargo, la producción de colágeno disminuye con la edad, lo que resalta la importancia de consumir alimentos que ayuden a su síntesis.\nUno de estos alimentos es el kale , una verdura versátil y rica en nutrientes que ha ganado popularidad por sus propiedades beneficiosas.\n¿Qué es el kale?\nEl kale es una hortaliza de la familia de las crucíferas con grandes beneficios para la salud (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) El kale, también conocido como col rizada , es una hortaliza de hojas verdes perteneciente a la familia de las crucíferas, a la cual también pertenecen el brócoli, la coliflor y las coles de Bruselas.\nDe sabor ligeramente amargo y textura fibrosa, el kale se distingue por su color verde intenso y sus hojas rizadas . Esta planta, que en el pasado era más común en la alimentación animal, se ha convertido en un elemento básico en las dietas saludables, gracias a su impresionante perfil nutricional.\n¿Cuáles son los beneficios del kale para la salud?\nEl kale ayuda a mantener los huesos fuertes gracias a su elevada concentración de calcio y vitamina K (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) El kale es un verdadero superalimento repleto de nutrientes esenciales . Entre sus principales beneficios destacan:\nAlto contenido de calcio: Con 150 mg de calcio por cada 100 gramos, el kale supera a la leche en su aporte de este mineral, contribuyendo a la salud ósea y a la prevención de enfermedades como la osteoporosis. Fuente de vitamina K: Una taza de col rizada contiene un aporte de vitamina K siete veces superior al valor diario recomendado, esencial para la coagulación sanguínea y la fijación del calcio en los huesos. Rico en vitamina C: Esta vitamina fortalece el sistema inmunológico y es fundamental para la síntesis de colágeno , lo que mejora la salud de la piel y la cicatrización de heridas. Hierro y antioxidantes: El kale contiene más hierro que la carne de vacío y es rico en antioxidantes como carotenoides y flavonoides, que ayudan a proteger al organismo contra el estrés oxidativo y potencian la salud celular. ¿Cómo ayuda el kale a generar colágeno?\nLa vitamina C en el kale es fundamental para la producción de colágeno (Europa Press) El kale es una fuente rica en vitamina C , un nutriente clave para la producción de colágeno . Esta vitamina participa activamente en la unión de los aminoácidos necesarios para formar las fibras de colágeno, las cuales mantienen la piel elástica y los tejidos conectivos firmes.\nAdemás, al proteger contra el daño oxidativo y reducir la daño, el kale contribuye a mantener las condiciones óptimas para que el organismo pueda producir y conservar colágeno de manera eficaz.\nCómo consumir col rizada para absorber sus nutrientes\nPreparar chips de kale al horno es una forma sabrosa de disfrutar de sus beneficios (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Para aprovechar al máximo las propiedades del kale, es recomendable consumirlo de distintas maneras que mantengan sus nutrientes intactos. Aquí algunos consejos:\nCrudo en ensaladas: El kale crudo conserva todo su contenido vitamínico. Se recomienda masajear las hojas con el aderezo para ablandar su textura y hacerlas más digestibles. Batidos y licuados: Mezclar kale con frutas como plátano, piña o manzana verde ayuda a potenciar su sabor y mejorar su absorción de nutrientes. Horneado en chips: Preparar chips de kale al horno con un toque de aceite de oliva y sal es una opción sabrosa y saludable para consumirlo de forma diferente. Salteado: Cocinado ligeramente con ajo y cebolla, el kale ofrece un plato rápido que conserva gran parte de sus vitaminas y minerales. Blanqueado y congelado: Para conservarlo, el kale puede blanquearse en agua hirviendo por 30 segundos y sumergirse inmediatamente en agua fría, manteniendo así sus nutrientes y su color. Ideas para incluir el kale en la dieta\nEl kale se puede consumir en ensaladas, batidos, chips al horno o salteado (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Incorporar el kale a la dieta diaria es sencillo gracias a su versatilidad. Aquí algunas ideas:\nEnsalada de kale y palta: Combinar kale picado con rodajas de palta, tomate, cebolla morada y aderezo de limón para un plato fresco y nutritivo. Batido verde energético: Mezclar una taza de kale con plátano, piña y agua de coco para obtener un batido lleno de energía. Chips de kale: Hornear hojas de kale con aceite de oliva y sal a 180°C por 10-15 minutos hasta que estén crujientes. Tortilla de kale: Saltear kale con cebolla y ajo, y agregado a la mezcla de huevo para una tortilla llena de sabor y beneficios. Sopas y guisos: Agregar kale a sopas y guisos al final de la cocción para disfrutar de su sabor y textura sin perder sus nutrientes. La incorporación regular de kale en la alimentación no solo aporta una buena dosis de vitaminas y minerales esenciales , sino que también contribuye a una mejor producción de colágeno , apoyando así la salud general y el bienestar del organismo.",

    "title": "Sandy Hook families want to seize Alex Jones' social media accounts",
    "text": "By Dietrich Knauth ,\n42 minutes ago\nBy Dietrich Knauth\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Families of the Sandy Hook massacre victims want to seize Alex Jones' social media accounts in his bankruptcy, saying that the conspiracy theorist's frequent posts to fans are a key part of the Infowars business being liquidated to pay Jones' debts.\nJones, who filed for bankruptcy protection 17 months ago, has given up on trying to reach a settlement that would reduce the $1.5 billion that he owes to the relatives of 20 students and six staff members killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\nJones and the Sandy Hook families now agree that Jones' assets should be liquidated in bankruptcy. But the families on Wednesday asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge in Houston, Texas, to additionally take control of Jones' X.com account and prevent Jones from using it to promote new business ventures.\nThe Sandy Hook families asked the judge to make clear that the Jones' \"@RealAlexJones\" account on X.com, formerly known as Twitter, will be among the assets turned over to a court-appointed trustee in charge of liquidating Jones' assets. Jones' X account, which has 2.3 million followers, is \"no different than a customer list of any other liquidating business,\" the Sandy Hook families argued.\nThey argued that Jones has used the social media account to push down the value of Infowars by diverting sales from that site to his father's DrJonesNaturals.com, which sells health supplements and other products.\nJones' attorney, Vickie Driver, said on Thursday that the Sandy Hook families' request was procedurally improper and that Jones would oppose it at the appropriate time.\n\"The Connecticut Plaintiffs have never wanted money from Jones but to silence him,\" Driver said.\nJones was banned from the platform for nearly five years, but his account was reinstated in December after a user poll conducted by X.com owner Elon Musk.\nA U.S. bankruptcy judge is scheduled to hear the families' demand at a Friday court hearing in Houston. The judge is expected to convert Alex Jones' bankruptcy case from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which offers more control to a bankrupt debtor, to a Chapter 7 liquidation, which would allow a court-appointed trustee to take and sell Jones' assets.\nJones claimed for years that the Sandy Hook killings were staged with actors as part of a government plot to seize Americans' guns. Jones has since acknowledged that the shooting occurred.\nThe judge overseeing Jones' bankruptcy has ruled that most of the debt will survive after a liquidation, because it resulted from \"willful and malicious\" conduct.\nJones has estimated that he has less than $12 million in assets, meaning that he will carry an enormous legal debt even after Infowars and his other assets are sold.\nThe Sandy Hook families intend to continue collection actions against Jones' future income, and pursue additional payments from Jones' wife, father, employees and other associates to whom Jones' allegedly diverted assets.\nA Chapter 7 liquidation will enable the Sandy Hook families to enforce their judgments \"now and into the future while also depriving Jones of the ability to inflict mass harm as he has done for some 25 years,\" said Chris Mattei, an attorney for the Sandy Hook families.\nJones has said on a June 7 broadcast of The Alex Jones show that Infowars is \"overrun\" and \"will be completely worthless\" without him. He encouraged listeners to buy products from DrJonesNaturals to support his \"future\" and make sure he can continue to broadcast after the shutdown of Infowars.\n\"I've already sold everything but my house,\" Jones said on June 7. \"I'm down to my last moves on this.\"\n(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth; Editing by Josie Kao)\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

The storm impacted several areas in Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc's service area, resulting in more than 50 broken poles, and multiple downed power lines, according to a Facebook post by Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. On Wednesday, Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. notified its users, saying people could be without power for an extended period of time as conditions were impacting repairs. \"Visibility is poor and in several areas the snow is deep, wet, and heavy, making it difficult for the line crews to get access to the outage sites to make repairs,\" wrote Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. On Thursday, Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. deployed the helicopter outage patrol team for an aerial assessment. Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc, expects repairs to take up to a week, as line crews are now facing flooding from melting snow.

    "text": "Ostenta un récord de siete victorias y una derrota\n«Los primeros golpes de Laura Chiquillo como profesional»\nFuente: Gaceta UNAM Sep 5, 2024\nLa boxeadora peso paja es alumna de Derecho en la FES Aragón, con 9.7 de promedio académico\nPor: Rodrigo de Buen\nUna rápida combinación de golpes, con la zurda y la derecha, dibuja lo mismo un jab, un uppercut, un gancho o un cruzado. Con los pies bien plantados sobre la superficie, así como la movilidad en la cintura y con la guardia siempre arriba. Traza también con las extremidades inferiores aquellos desplazamientos hacia el frente, o hacia atrás, con pequeños saltos. Todo es finalmente movimiento, como lo es el día a día, en la división de los 47 kilogramos, peso paja, dentro del mundo pugilístico.\nSu jornada arranca a las cuatro de la mañana. A las cinco comienza su entrenamiento, corre alrededor del Estadio Olímpico Universitario entre 45 minutos y una hora. Luego hace trabajo en el gimnasio, salta la cuerda y perfecciona su técnica del boxeo, ya sea sola o con sparring; también utiliza costales, la pera, se ejercita en el round de sombra y culmina con acondicionamiento físico, a la una de la tarde.\nDespués, se embarca en las profundidades del metro de la Ciudad de México, para estar antes de las cuatro de la tarde en su primera clase en la FES Aragón, donde termina a las nueve de la noche su día escolar.\nEse promedio de 9.7 que ostenta es fruto de su empeño en el cumplimiento de sus deberes académicos. Llega a casa cerca de las 11 de la noche, alista sus cosas para el día siguiente, y casi a la media noche duerme profundamente para intentar recuperar las energías invertidas.\n“Pienso en grande como deportista. Aspiro a ganar un campeonato del mundo. Estimo que sea dentro de un par de años, cuando acumule un mayor récord de combates. Soy tenaz y sé que lo voy a lograr”, afirma Chiquillo Hernández.\nLa boxeadora auriazul inició a los 14 años en este deporte, siendo un hobby, pero la adrenalina que le provoca la atrapó hasta acumular 70 peleas como amateur. “A los 17 años decidí incursionar en el profesionalismo en lugar de seguir con una carrera olímpica dentro de mi deporte. A estas alturas debería tener unos 20 combates dentro del profesionalismo, pero los dos años de la pandemia impidieron mi desarrollo”, asevera la pugilista, que ostenta un récord de siete victorias y una derrota, con el objetivo de pelear más seguido para acumular más triunfos y tener mejores oportunidades.\nSu camino no ha sido fácil en el mundo del boxeo, tampoco dentro de las aulas, donde se forma para ejercer una carrera judicial y llevar a cabo un intercambio académico en alguna universidad en el extranjero, apoyada con lo que la UNAM ofrece al respecto, sin dejar de prepararse en lo deportivo.\n“El boxeo me genera entusiasmo, me pone de buenas cuando estoy triste, pero también me exige demasiado. Cada vez que subo al ring se desencadenan varias sensaciones, me invita a ser más disciplinada, más fuerte y me da el impulso para ser mejor cada día. Tomo muy en serio mi cuidado personal, la alimentación, el descanso, y sé que cada sacrificio al final valdrá la pena”, sentencia la alumna deportista, quien cursó el bachillerato en la Escuela Nacional Preparatoria plantel 7 Ezequiel A. Chávez, y tiene como referentes a la boxeadora mexicana Jackie Nava, a Julio César Chávez y al ucraniano Vasyl Lomachenko.",

    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7.\nGlobal Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities.\nThe Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month.\nAs Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed.\nHere's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada:\nJudih Weinstein Haggai\nJudih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says.\nShe told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there.\nLast week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza.\nWeinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships.\nWeinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nHer brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims.\n\"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\"\nVivian Silver\nVivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel.\n\"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club.\nHe said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming.\nZeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza.\nOn Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver.\nHe said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974.\nShe dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added.\nShe also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel.\nTiferet Lapidot\nTiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began.\nHer cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall.\nHer uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom.\nZlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage.\nHarel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral.\n\"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\"\nTiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nHarel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel.\nNetta Epstein\nIsraeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack.\nHis mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived.\nNetta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers.\nShachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion.\nShe said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service.\nHe was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city.\nShir Georgy\nIsraeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im.\nGeorgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death.\n\"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message.\nBouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured.\nGeorgy's funeral was held in Israel.\nAdi Vital-Kaploun\nAdi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa.\nThe group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area.\nThe family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack.\n\"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview.\nThe family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household.\nShe was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player.\nAfter completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said.\n\"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\"\nBen Mizrachi\nCanadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel.\nMizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C.\nEzra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force.\nHilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him.\nNurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school.\n\"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\"\nAlexandre Look\nAlexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival.\nLook, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post.\n\"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said.\nFriend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship.\nIn a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel.\nHe was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said.\n\"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",
