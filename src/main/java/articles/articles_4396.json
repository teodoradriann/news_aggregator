    "text": "1 hour ago\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra has admitted it made a “mistake” in canceling a concert by a popular pianist after comments he made about Israel’s war in Gaza.\nOn Sunday, Jason Gillam performed his first five-minute piece of music called “Witness – Witness,” written by composer Connor DiNito, and for journalists in Gaza.\nBefore the ceremony began, Gillam said that Israel had killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists.\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra then canceled the British-Australian pianist’s section from a concert he was due to play on Thursday, saying it put the orchestra in a “difficult position”.\nNow the entire concert, which was scheduled to take place at Melbourne Town Hall, has been canceled due to safety concerns.\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra says it is trying to reschedule the show.\nJason Lloyd Gillam\nJason Lloyd Gillam, born 1986, is an Australian-British classical pianist based in London. He is gay and supports the gay and bisexual community, and in 2017 he was officially engaged to a friend of his named Syed Mohandas, who lives with him.\nGillam grew up in Queensland and started piano lessons when he was four years old. He continued to study in Australia until 2007 when he went to London to study at the Royal Academy of Music, where he obtained a Master’s degree in Music. Gillam won several awards, and the musicians described his playing as “playing with a simple, aristocratic elegance. ”And that he “plays Beethoven with a kind of flare.”\nGillam says of music: “I am a musician because I believe in the power of music – to heal, to connect feelings, to spread compassion…’ The biggest lesson I learned from him is compassion.”\nGillam has participated in concerts with leading international orchestras, including the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, and others.\nHe has also participated in international festivals, including the Verbier Festival, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the Linare Classical Festival (Tuscany), the Two Mors Festival, and the Norfolk and Norwich Festival.\nWhat did Gillam say at the Melbourne concert?\nAt Sunday’s concert, held at Melbourne’s Iwaki Hall, Jason Gillam performed a range of other works, including pieces by Beethoven and Chopin.\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra says the piece “Witness” was added to the section at the last minute.\n“Over the last 10 months, Israel has killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists,” Gillam said before starting to play Witness, according to music news site Sleep Desk during… They wear the their press jackets.\nHe said, “The killing of journalists is a war crime under international law, and this is only done to prevent war crimes from being recorded and broadcast to the world “\nThen he ended his speech by saying: “Besides the role of journalists who bear witness, the word witness and martyr in the Arabic language come from the same root.”\nApology Melbourne Orchestra\n“While the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra maintains that the concert stage is not an appropriate stage for political commentary, we recognize Jason’s concerns about those in the Middle East and elsewhere,” the Symphony Orchestra said. Melbourne in an apology statement on Thursday.\nThe statement said: “We recognize the strong feelings of all parties on this issue and particularly recognize the commitment and dedication shown by our musicians and staff this week .\nGillam accepted the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s apology. “I value my relationship with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, its performers and audiences and look forward to continuing our working relationship in the years to come, ” he said in a statement.\nCritics\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s decision and subsequent apology caused an uproar on social media.\nProminent lawyer Greg Barnes called the cancellation “truly appalling,” later adding that “what often empowers art is that it’s political.” “\nLeo Schofield, art critic and former president of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, said of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s apology: “I wish Gillam had given a concert in Sydney. If he had, he would have received standing ovation from supporters who valued his courage as much as his courage. talent.”\nimage source, jaysongillham.com\nComment on the picture, “Music can do what words cannot,” said Gillam, “It has the ability to reach inside us and enter the heart of our movement.”\nCollecting donations for Palestinian children\nGillam’s comments in Melbourne were not the first in which he showed support for the Palestinians, as he had previously participated, with several Arab musicians, in a charity concert in Manchester Manchester church to collect donations for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund.\n“I am honored to be performing in one of the most poignant and meaningful concerts of my life at Manchester Cathedral on June 4, 2024, which has helped raise over £4,000 for the Children’s Relief Fund Palestine,” he said at the ceremony.\nHe said: “Music can do what words cannot. It has the ability to reach inside us and enter the heart to move us.”\n“I’ve spent a lot of time choosing my repertoire tonight. The scale of what we have seen over the past eight months is so great it is unbelievable. As Gary Lineker said – this is the worst thing we have ever seen in our lives. .”\n“I wanted to find something that reflected the magnitude of the moral and spiritual work ahead of us. “\nThe results of the Gaza war\nIsrael’s war in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all parties have tried to manage carefully.\nThat was the case in countless other countries, and there were protests from Jewish and Muslim groups, as well as a sharp rise in anti-Islamism and anti-Semitism.\nTerrorists led by Hamas killed about 1,200 people in an attack on October 7, and took another 251 hostage to Gaza.\nAs a result of this attack Israel launched a massive military attack on Gaza and the current war began.\nAbout 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in this war so far, according to what the Ministry of Health in Gaza says.\nAmong them, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organization working to promote press freedom, were at least 113 journalists.\n2024-08-15 18:13:26\n#Gaza #War #famous #pianist #concert #Australia #canceled #piece #dedicated #journalists",

    "text": "BOISE, Idaho — Prepare for the plows! After some serious snow, [ACHD has started moving its snow plows from main roads into neighborhood streets](/article/news/local/local-achd-to-start-plowing-on-residential-streets/277-7a0a6e5e-8d93-4915-93e8-ae1301bc0014). ACHD remains in 24-hour operations, and with snow expected to stick around. the district is clearing more than just their [top priorities](/article/news/local/local-how-achd-prioritizes-which-roads-to-plow-first-when-snow-falls/277-3336ec07-4bf9-4357-89fa-1bf0600393ae#%3A~%3Atext=ACHD%20has%20three%20priority%20levels,hospitals,%20fire%20stations%20and%20schools.) - which are main roads, roads with inclines, and areas around schools, hospitals, and fire stations. The district moved its winter operations into residential areas Sunday night, as they clear snow on more than 3,000 lane miles of residential streets throughout Ada County. KTVB rode along in an ACHD snow plow as it cleared neighborhoods in Boise's North End Monday morning. Maneuvering through the narrow neighborhoods is a change of pace for the plows - and ACHD general equipment operator (GEO) Sean Collins. \"It's really fun, it's nerve-wracking at first,\" Collins said. \"Because you're always worried about hitting stuff, you don't want to fling snow, and you don't want to hit cars. So, everything is a really slow pace. And then you've got to know where you need to push the snow, because everything has to go to the curb.\" As they plow the snowy streets, there are a few things you can do to make snow plow drivers' lives a little easier - including avoiding shoveling snow into the roads, keeping storm drains clear, and parking off-street if possible. \"Down here [in the North End], try and get your car parked as close to the curb as possible either before the storm or after the storm,\" Collins said. \"I know people clear around their cars and everything, but the moment I come back through, it's just going to get pushed right into their car. So, the best thing to do if you're going to shovel around your car to help clear out the road - you need to try and get it shoveled up onto your yard.\" ACHD said it could take some time to clear all the residential streets in the county, [depending on when the weather warms up](/weather/).

    "text": "The Pentagon’s latest report on UFOs has revealed hundreds of new instances of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena — including a recent near miss involving a commercial plane and a mysterious “object” near New York.\nThe Empire State close call was among 757 cases of unidentified anomalous phenomena — more commonly known as unidentified flying objects or “UFOs” — reported to US authorities within the past year, according to the annual report released Thursday.\nIn that case, the airline crew had reported to the Federal Aviation Administration that its commercial plane had a “near miss with a ‘cylindrical object’ while over the Atlantic Ocean” just off the coast of New York.\nThe New York incident was among 757 cases of UFOs reported to US authorities within the past year. (The UFO pictured is unrelated to the Empire State case.) AARO/DOD\nIt wasn’t immediately clear when the sighting happened, or which airline was involved.\nThe Pentagon’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is still investigating the incident, the office’s report stated.\nThe New York instance was also the only case recorded where a “possible flight safety issue” was encountered “during the event,” the report added.\nExplore More Pentagon says nearly two dozen UFO sightings can’t be explained: ‘True anomalies’ Congressional UFO hearing details alleged secret government programs, descriptions of ‘alien’ craft Lauren Boebert probes UFO experts on existence of underwater alien bases on Earth: ‘The American people are being kept in the dark’ Of the hundreds of cases reported, investigators found explanations for nearly 300 of the incidents.\nIn many cases, the unknown objects were later identified as balloons, birds, aircraft, drones or satellites.\nBut hundreds of other apparent sightings remain unexplained — though the report stressed it is often because there isn’t enough information to draw firm conclusions.\nFor witnesses who provided visual descriptions, common reports included unidentified lights or round, spherical or orb-shaped objects.\nOther reports included a witness who reported a jellyfish with flashing lights.\nThe Pentagon’s latest report on UFOs has revealed hundreds of new instances of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena made between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024. AFP via Getty Images\nElon Musk’s Starlink satellite system was an increasingly common source as people mistake chains of satellites for UFOs, according to the report.\nAARO officials said, though, there’s no indication that any of the cases they looked into have unearthly origins.\n“It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,” the report’s authors wrote.\nThe 757 cases identified in the report were made between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024.\nThe total includes 272 incidents that occurred before that period but hadn’t previously been reported to US authorities, the report noted.\nWith Post wires",

    "text": "Лейкоз, хроническая усталость, анемия. Эфир от 01.07.2025 Постоянная сонливость может быть не просто следствием недосыпания, но и серьезным симптомом различных заболеваний. Доктор Александр Мясников рассказал в программе «О самом главном», когда дневная сонливость – это повод для беспокойства, а когда – естественная потребность организма.\nДневная сонливость – явление, знакомое многим. Как отмечает Мясников, это может быть связано не только со стрессом и недосыпанием, но и указывать на серьезные проблемы со здоровьем: нехватку витаминов, нарушения работы щитовидной железы или развитие сердечной недостаточности.\nПо словам эксперта, важно различать естественную потребность организма в дневном отдыхе и патологическую сонливость. \"Многим людям просто не хватает энергии на 12-16 часов активности\", – поясняет Мясников. В таких случаях он рекомендует короткий дневной сон продолжительностью 15-20 минут, который помогает восстановить силы.\nОсобое внимание врач уделил проблеме сонливости за рулем, и подчеркнул, что борьба с сонливостью при помощи энергетических напитков может быть опасной для здоровья.\nСреди других причин повышенной сонливости доктор отметил:\n— прием определенных лекарств (особенно бета-блокаторов);\n— обильное употребление пищи;\n— монотонную деятельность;\n— депрессивные состояния.\n\"Не нужно бороться с естественной потребностью во сне. Лучше прислушаться к своему организму и при необходимости разделить день на две части, выделив время для короткого отдыха\" – подчеркнул Мясников.\nПодробнее о причинах сонливости, методах борьбы с ней и о том, когда необходимо обратиться к врачу, узнаете в новом выпуске шоу \"О самом главном\" на медиаплатформе \"Смотрим\".\nИсточник — http://griskomed.ru/doktor-miasnikov-nazval-neojidannye-prichiny-dnevnoi-sonlivosti.html",

    "title": "Europe : le smartphone désormais interdit au primaire, collège et lycée de ce pays",
    "text": "Depuis plus de vingt ans, le smartphone s’est imposé comme un compagnon omniprésent dans la vie quotidienne, modifiant en profondeur la manière dont nous communiquons, travaillons et accédons à l’information. Ce petit appareil, d’abord perçu comme un simple outil de communication, est devenu un prolongement quasi indispensable de l’existence pour toutes les générations, notamment chez les jeunes. Pourtant, cette immersion constante dans le monde numérique soulève des questions importantes quant à ses effets sur le développement cognitif et le bien-être des adolescents, en particulier dans le cadre scolaire.\nL’interdiction élargie à tous les niveaux scolaires Face à ces préoccupations, l’Italie a récemment pris une décision majeure à la mi-juin : l’interdiction des smartphones dans les écoles primaires, les collèges et désormais aussi dans tous les établissements du secondaire, y compris les lycées, à compter de septembre. Cette mesure, initiée par le ministre de l’Éducation Giuseppe Valditara , fait suite à une prise de conscience accrue des risques liés à l’utilisation excessive de ces appareils chez les jeunes. Alors que le smartphone pouvait déjà être banni dans les classes des plus petits, cette nouvelle directive étend cette restriction à tous les élèves de l’enseignement secondaire , un pas significatif vers la protection de la concentration et de la santé mentale des adolescents.\nLe ministre a justifié cette démarche en s’appuyant sur des recherches scientifiques qui pointent les effets négatifs du recours intensif aux smartphones, comme l’a rapporté le quotidien La Repubblica . La perte d’attention, la diminution des capacités de mémorisation, ainsi que les troubles liés à la santé mentale comme l’anxiété et le stress, figurent parmi les conséquences les plus préoccupantes relevées par les experts. Le ministre a adressé une circulaire aux chefs d’établissements pour assurer la mise en œuvre effective de cette politique, montrant ainsi une volonté claire d’encadrer strictement l’usage des technologies dans le milieu éducatif.\nLes smartphones : outils puissants mais aux effets ambivalents Le smartphone est souvent comparé à une porte ouverte vers un univers infini d’informations et de possibilités sociales. Il permet de rester connecté en permanence, de partager des moments, mais aussi d’apprendre de nouvelles choses. Toutefois, ce même outil qui facilite l’accès au savoir peut aussi devenir une source de distraction intense. Sur le plan scolaire, où l’attention soutenue et la réflexion profonde sont essentielles, la présence constante du téléphone crée une tentation permanente qui détourne l’élève de ses apprentissages.\nL’analogie avec une salle d’étude envahie par des bruits parasites illustre bien ce phénomène : même un son léger ou une lumière intermittente peuvent perturber la concentration. De la même façon, les notifications, messages et réseaux sociaux sur smartphone fragmentent l’attention, empêchant les jeunes de se plonger pleinement dans leurs cours. En réduisant l’exposition à ces stimuli, l’interdiction vise à créer un environnement plus propice à l’apprentissage, encourageant une présence mentale totale et une meilleure assimilation des connaissances.\nUne mesure qui interroge sur l’équilibre entre technologie et éducation La décision italienne soulève des débats sur la place qu’occupe la technologie dans les écoles aujourd’hui. Certains y voient un retour nécessaire à un cadre plus traditionnel et discipliné, d’autres redoutent une coupure trop brutale avec la réalité numérique, qui est désormais au cœur de la vie des jeunes. Cependant, ce choix met en lumière l’enjeu crucial d’accompagner l’utilisation des outils digitaux de manière réfléchie, en ménageant des temps sans écran pour préserver la santé cognitive et émotionnelle des élèves.\nAu-delà de l’Italie , cette politique pourrait inspirer d’autres pays confrontés à des problématiques similaires. Elle invite à repenser l’intégration du numérique dans l’éducation, non pas comme une simple adoption technologique, mais comme une démarche exigeante, qui tient compte des limites humaines face à l’hyperconnexion . L’objectif est de trouver un équilibre où le smartphone reste un outil au service de l’apprentissage, sans devenir un obstacle à la concentration et au développement personnel.\nLa mise en œuvre de cette interdiction montre la volonté d’agir concrètement pour favoriser des conditions d’études plus sereines. Elle ouvre une réflexion sur les pratiques scolaires et les adaptations nécessaires face à l’évolution rapide des modes de communication des jeunes générations. La question reste ouverte sur l’efficacité à long terme de cette mesure et sur les stratégies complémentaires à adopter pour accompagner les élèves vers une utilisation responsable et équilibrée des technologies.",
