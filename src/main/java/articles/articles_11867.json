    "text": "By Airiel B. ,\n17 hours ago\nSource: CFOTO / Getty\nTikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court intervenes to stop the ban.\nThe law is set to take effect in a few days, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also allows the president to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on Friday, Jan. 10. The justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a “political resolution” and avoid deciding the case.\nRELATED: Watch Before It’s Banned: 30 TikTok Moments We’ll Never Forget\nAt this time, it is unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect’s views into account. TikTok and China-based ByteDance argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution’s free speech guarantee\nThe Biden administration is defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress stating that “no one can seriously dispute that (China’s) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.”\nIn December, a panel of three appellate judges unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims. If the law takes effect, Trump’s Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it.\nAdditionally. lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law’s most severe consequences. A shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue, they added.\nClick here to read more about the case.\nWill TikTok Be Banned In January?

    "text": "By Vanessa G. Sánchez, KFF Health News\nLOS ANGELES — The party was winding down. Its young hosts, María Rivas Cruz and her fiancé, Raymond Olivares, had accompanied friends to their car to bid them farewell. As the couple crossed a four-lane main road back to the home they had just bought, Rivas Cruz and Olivares were struck by a car fleeing an illegal street race. The driver was going 70 in a 40-mph zone.\nDespite years of pleading for a two-lane road, lower speed limits, safety islands, and more marked crosswalks, residents say the county had done little to address speeding in this unincorporated pocket of southeastern Los Angeles. Since 2012, this half-mile stretch of Avalon Boulevard had logged 396 crashes, injuring 170 and killing three.\nOlivares, 27, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, became the fourth fatality when he was hurled across the street, hit by a second car, and instantly killed. Rivas Cruz was transported to a hospital, where she remained in a coma for two weeks. Once awake, the elementary school teacher underwent a series of reconstructive surgeries to repair her arm, jaw, and legs.\nIn the aftermath of the February 2023 crash, the county installed protective steel posts midway across the street. But residents, who had sought a platformed center divider and speed cameras, said that wasn’t enough.\n“It’s just a band-aid on a cut. This is supposed to solve it, but it doesn’t, and that is what hurts,” said Rivas Cruz, who now at age 28 walks with a cane and lives with chronic pain. “I go to sleep, and I’m like, ‘It’s just a dream, it’s just a dream.’ And it’s not.”\nThe nation’s road system covers 4 million miles and is governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local jurisdictions that often operate in silos, making systemic change difficult and expensive. But amid the highest number of pedestrians killed in decades, localities are pushing to control how speed limits are set and for more accountability on road design. This spring, New York and Michigan passed laws allowing local jurisdictions to lower speed limits. In Los Angeles, voters approved a measure that forces the city to act on its own safety improvement plan , mandating that the car-loving metropolis redesign streets, add bike lanes, and protect cyclists, transit riders, and pedestrians.\nStill, there’s plenty of political resistance to speed enforcement. In California’s Statehouse, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) proposed requiring GPS-equipped smart devices in new cars and trucks to prevent excessive speeding. But after pushback, the state lawmaker watered down his bill to require all vehicles sold in the state starting in 2032 to have only warning systems that alert drivers when they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph.\nAlthough the Biden administration is championing Vision Zero — its commitment to zero traffic deaths — and injecting more than $20 billion in funding for transportation safety programs through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , road safety advocates and some lawmakers argue that the country is still far from making streets and vehicles safe, or slowing drivers down.\n“We are not showing the political will to use the proven safety tools that exist,” said Leah Shahum, founder of Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit organization advancing Vision Zero in communities across the country.\nStill a crisis The need for safer roads took on urgency during the covid pandemic. Fatalities rose even as lockdown mandates emptied streets. In 2022 , more than 42,500 people died on American roads, and at least 7,522 pedestrians were fatally struck — the highest tally of pedestrian deaths in more than four decades.\nExperts cite several reasons for the decline in road safety. During the lockdowns, reckless driving increased while traffic enforcement declined. SUVs and trucks have become larger and heavier, thus deadlier when they hit a pedestrian. Other factors persist as streets remain wide to accommodate vehicles, and in some states speed limits have gradually increased .\nEarly estimates of motor vehicle fatalities show a slight decrease from 2022 to 2023, but pedestrian fatalities are still notably above pre-pandemic numbers . “It’s an encouraging start, but the numbers still constitute a crisis,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote in February of roadway deaths.\nThe Biden administration has directed $15.6 billion to road safety until 2026 and $5 billion in local grants to prevent roadway deaths and injuries. Under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s new “ vulnerable road user” rule , states with 15% or more deaths involving pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists compared with all road deaths must match federal dollars in their safety improvement spending.\nRoad safety advocates argue the federal government missed an opportunity to eliminate outdated standards for setting speed limits when it revised traffic guidelines last year . The agency could have eliminated guidance recommending setting speed limits at or below how fast 85% of drivers travel on uncongested roads. Critics contend that what’s known as the 85th percentile rule encourages traffic engineers to set speed limits at levels unsafe for pedestrians.\nBut the Federal Highway Administration wrote in a statement that while the 85th percentile is the typical method, engineers rarely rely solely on this rule. It also noted that states and some local agencies have their own criteria for setting speed limits.\nIn response, grassroots efforts to curtail speeding have sprouted across communities. In April, Michigan passed legislation granting local governments authority to round down when setting speed limits.\nAnd after four years of lobbying, New York state passed Sammy’s Law, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, who was killed by a driver in Brooklyn in 2013. The law, which will take effect in June, allows New York City to lower its speed limits to 20 mph in designated areas.\n“With this legislation, I hope we can learn more children’s names because of their accomplishments, their personalities, and their spirit — not their final moments,” said Sammy’s mother, Amy Cohen.\nPush for pedestrian safety Advocates would also like the federal government to factor in pedestrian safety on the five-star vehicle safety rating scale. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed a separate pass/fail test that would be posted only on the agency’s website, not on labels consumers would see at the dealership.\nRelated Articles National Politics | Elon Musk, America’s richest immigrant, is angry about immigration.

According to the campaign finance site Open Secrets, automakers spent about $49 million lobbying in 2023 compared with $2.2 million spent by advocates for highway and auto safety.\n“The federal government has the biggest punch when it comes to requiring improved vehicle safety design,” said Wiener, the California state lawmaker.\nAlthough Wiener modified his proposal to restrict excessive speeding, he has advanced companion legislation that would require Caltrans, the state transportation agency, to make improvements such as adding crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better serve pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.\nWhen that bill was heard in a committee, opponents, including engineering firms and contractors, cautioned it would remove flexibility and hamper the state’s ability to deliver a safe and efficient transportation system. Lawmakers have until Aug. 31 to act on his bills.\nIn Los Angeles, hope for change arrived in March when voters passed Measure HLA , which requires the city to invest $3.1 billion in road safety over the next decade. Rivas Cruz’s house, however, sits eight blocks outside the jurisdiction of the city initiative.\nIt’s been more than a year since the crash, but Rivas Cruz finds reminders everywhere: in the mirror, when she looks at the scars left on her face after several surgeries. When she walks on the street that still lacks the infrastructure that would have protected her and Raymond.\nStories of pedestrians killed in this Latino working-class neighborhood are too common, said Rivas Cruz. In September, she attended a memorial of a 14-year-old who was killed by a reckless driver.\n“There’s so much death going on,” the Los Angeles Unified School District teacher said from her mother’s living room on a spring afternoon. “The representatives have failed us. Raymond and I were giving back to the community. He was a civil engineer working for the city, and I’m a LAUSD teacher.

    "title": "Conheça os filhos de grandes jogadores que estão brilhando na Europa",
    "text": "O mundo do futebol é frequentemente palco de histórias familiares que se perpetuam através das gerações. De tempos em tempos, surgem jogadores que carregam o legado dos seus pais, grandes ícones do passado, fazendo com que os fãs se perguntem: “Será que ele é filho do…?”. Esse fenômeno tem se tornado comum nas principais ligas da Europa e outros campeonatos globais. Este artigo destaca dez jogadores que, sob o olhar atento de seus pais renomados, estão conquistando seu espaço no cenário internacional.\nEsses jovens não apenas mantêm o prestígio dos nomes familiares, mas também alcançam marcos notáveis em suas carreiras. Da Itália à Inglaterra, eles provam que a paixão pelo futebol pode ser uma herança poderosa. A seguir, apresentamos algumas destas promessas que, além de seguir os passos de seus pais, estão começando a traçar suas próprias jornadas de sucesso.\nGiuliano Simeone (Filho de Diego Simeone – atual técnico do Atlético de Madrid) Giovanni Simeone (Filho de Diego Simeone – atual técnico do Atlético de Madrid) Alexis Mac Allister (Filho de Carlos Mac Allister, argentino) Federico Redondo (Filho de Fernando Redondo, craque argentino) Francisco Conceição (Filho de Sérgio Conceição) Khéphren Thuram (Filho de Lilian Thuram, um dos grandes nomes da França) Timoty Weah (Filho de George Weah, ídolo e já eleito melhor do mundo) Marcos Thuram (Filho de Lilian Thuram, um dos grandes nomes da França) Justin Kluivert (Filho de Patrick Kluivert, um dos grandes nomes da Holanda) Federico Chiesa (Filho de Enrico Cheisa, um dos grandes nomes da Itália) Siga o canal no WhatsApp e fique por dentro das últimas notícias. Para fazer parte da nossa comunidade, acompanhe a PLACAR nas mídias sociais .\nGiuliano Simeone: Brilha no Atlético de Madrid com Seu Pai Um dos principais talentos em ascensão é Giuliano Simeone, atacante do Atlético de Madrid. Ele joga sob o comando de seu pai, Diego Simeone, um dos maiores nomes da seleção argentina nos anos 90 e 2000. Com 22 anos, Giuliano se tornou peça-chave no time principal do clube espanhol após um período emprestado ao Alavés. Neste ano, ele já marcou um gol e deu três assistências em 19 partidas, ressaltando seu desenvolvimento no futebol europeu.\nGiovanni Simeone e Alexis Mac Allister: Brilhando nas Ligas Italiana e Inglesa Giovanni Simeone, irmão mais velho de Giuliano, atua no Napoli, embora jogue com menos regularidade do que em seus tempos de Fiorentina e Genoa. Aos 29 anos, ainda integra a seleção argentina, com 101 gols em jogos oficiais. Outro talento argentino em destaque é Alexis Mac Allister, agora no Liverpool. Com 26 anos, ele já superou a fama de seu pai, Carlos Mac Allister, destacando-se na conquista da Argentina na Copa do Mundo de 2022.\nFederico Redondo: Talento Promissor na Inter Miami Federico Redondo, com 21 anos, segue os passos de seu pai, Fernando Redondo. Após um desempenho notável na Libertadores 2023 pelo Argentinos Juniors, Federico se transferiu para a Inter Miami. Lá, já participou de 25 jogos, com dois gols e três assistências. Sua convocação para a seleção olímpica da Argentina para os Jogos Olímpicos de Paris confirma seu potencial de impacto no futebol internacional.\nImpacto dos Legados na Ascensão dos Novos Talentos O legado familiar possui um impacto significativo nas carreiras dos novos talentos do futebol. Filhos de célebres jogadores enfrentam a pressão das expectativas e podem desfrutar das vantagens do conhecimento e rede de contatos dos pais. Esse legado pode servir de impulso, como mostram os casos de Francisco Conceição e Khéphren Thuram, que se destacam na Juventus, ou Timothy Weah, que busca reafirmar o legado do pai, George Weah. Os sucessos e desafios que estes jovens encontram confirmam que, apesar das expectativas, eles têm a capacidade de brilhar por seu próprio mérito.\nMarcus Thuram e Justin Kluivert: Gol e Recordes Entre outros talentos que consolidam o legado familiar estão Marcus Thuram e Justin Kluivert. Marcus, artilheiro da Série A pelo Inter de Milão, continua a brilhar na elite do futebol italiano, enquanto Justin, agora no Bournemouth, se firmou como o artilheiro do clube inglês. Ambos mostram que, apesar do peso de seus sobrenomes, o comprometimento em campo é o que realmente traça suas carreiras.\nEm resumo, seja pela pressão ou vantagem de seus sobrenomes, esses jogadores continuam a criar suas trajetórias no futebol europeu. Eles não apenas honram o legado de suas famílias, mas também inauguram suas próprias histórias de sucesso.",
