    "text": "SpaceX Sets New Record with 96 Orbital Missions in a Single Year\nSummary: In an extraordinary display of technological prowess and operational efficiency, SpaceX has shattered its own previous record by executing 96 successful orbital missions in 2023. This milestone underscores the company’s dominant position in the space industry and highlights its ongoing advancements in rocket reusability.\nSpace exploration and launch company SpaceX, led by visionary entrepreneur Elon Musk, achieved an unprecedented milestone in 2023 by executing a staggering 96 orbital launches. This monumental feat significantly exceeds their prior record of 61 missions in 2022, illustrating an accelerated launch frequency that averages out to a mission nearly every four days.\nSpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was responsible for the majority of the year’s missions, with a total of 91 launches, while the more powerful Falcon Heavy contributed to five missions. Notably, a single rocket within SpaceX’s fleet achieved a record of 19 successful launches and landings, reinforcing the company’s commitment to making spaceflight more sustainable by reusing rockets.\nFurthermore, this year saw SpaceX’s 250th successful recovery of an orbital rocket booster, marking a significant achievement in the company’s quest for cost-effective space travel. This push toward rocket reusability is a cornerstone of SpaceX’s ambitious aspirations.\nAn unprecedented achievement was recorded for the shortest turnaround time between two orbital launches, clocking in under three hours—a feat not seen since the days of NASA’s Gemini 11 mission in 1966.\nLooking forward, SpaceX has announced its intention to increase its mission cadence even further, aiming for up to 144 Falcon launches in 2024. This goal aligns with the company’s strategy to expand its satellite-based Starlink internet service, which significantly contributes to SpaceX’s valuation, currently estimated at $180 billion. The fervor of SpaceX’s efforts and the vision of its leadership suggest that this year’s record is but a stepping stone to even greater accomplishments in the realm of commercial space exploration.\nFAQs about SpaceX’s 2023 Orbital Missions Record\nWhat record did SpaceX break in 2023?\nSpaceX broke its own record for the number of successful orbital missions in a year, completing 96 launches in 2023.\nWho is the leader of SpaceX?\nSpaceX is led by Elon Musk, the entrepreneur known for his ambitious goals in space exploration.\nWhat is the significance of SpaceX’s new record?\nThe record is a testament to SpaceX’s technological prowess, operational efficiency, and leading position in the space industry.\nWhich rockets were used for the 2023 missions?\nThe majority of the missions, 91 to be exact, were carried out using the Falcon 9 rocket, and the other five missions were conducted with the Falcon Heavy rocket.\nCan you give an example of rocket reusability within SpaceX?\nYes, a single rocket in the SpaceX fleet reached a milestone of 19 successful launches and landings, emphasizing the company’s initiative towards sustainable spaceflight through reusability.\nWhat is rocket reusability and why is it important?\nRocket reusability is the ability to use the same rocket booster multiple times for different launches. It is crucial because it significantly reduces the cost of access to space, making space travel more sustainable and cost-effective.\nWhat is Starlink?\nStarlink is SpaceX’s satellite-based internet service, which contributes notably to the company’s valuation and revenue.\nWhat are SpaceX’s future launch goals?\nSpaceX aims to increase its launch frequency even further, with a target of up to 144 Falcon launches in 2024.\nWhat is SpaceX’s current valuation?\nAs of the report, SpaceX’s valuation is estimated at around $180 billion.\nWhy was the turnaround time between two SpaceX launches notable?\nThe turnaround time of under three hours between two orbital launches was unprecedented since 1966 and underscores the efficiency of SpaceX’s launch operations.\nDefinitions\n– Orbital Launch: A mission in which a spacecraft is sent into an orbit around Earth.\n– Rocket Reusability: The concept of using the same rocket hardware multiple times to lower the cost of space access.\n– Booster Recovery: The process of retrieving and refurbishing the first stage of a rocket after it has been used in a launch.\n– Turnaround Time: The time interval between the end of one mission and the start of another.\nSuggested Related Links\n– For information on SpaceX and their missions, visit:\nSpaceX\n– To learn more about Elon Musk’s ventures, access:\nTesla which is another of Musk’s companies.\n– To discover more details on Starlink internet services, refer to:\nStarlink\n– For historical data on NASA’s Gemini missions, you can go to:\nNASA\nMichał Rogucki is a pioneering figure in the field of renewable energy, particularly known for his work on solar power innovations.

    "text": "agricultura\nEl clima retrasa una temporada de “tránsito” para el tomate rosa\nSe siguen dando pasos para lograr la Denominación de Origen\nLas plantaciones de Tomate Rosa de Barbastro se iniciaron a comienzos de abril y las más “tardanas” serán en torno al 20 de junio, según informa Óscar Olivera, presidente de la Asociación de Productores, Comercializadores y Transformadores, quien estima, aunque no da cifras, una campaña de similares características a la del 2024, que concluyó con 2.500.000 kilos. Las condiciones climatológicas retrasaron quince días el inicio de tareas en fechas habituales, respecto a un año normal, porque había riesgos de heladas, en menor medida en los invernaderos.\nOlivera se refirió a la campaña de 2025 en términos “de tránsito” porque ya se han dado los primeros pasos para conseguir una Denominación de Origen para Tomate Rosa de Barbastro. “Está pendiente el censo de productores interesados en formar parte conforme a las condiciones y los estatutos que deben cumplirse. La campaña se iniciará con ese punto de inflexión para conseguir el mejor producto posible en calidad por encima de la cantidad. El camino es que sea gourmet y se venda muy bien en los mercados”, relata.\nLa marca para comercializar el Tomate Rosa de Barbastro se registró el 9 de octubre de 2014 en la Oficina Española de Patentes y Marcas, con antelación a reconocer la propiedad intelectual para el producto por parte del Ministerio de Industria, Energía y Turismo. Hasta ahora, no hay Denominación de Origen ni tampoco Indicación Geográfica Protegida (IGP) o similares. En eso se trabaja, “ya tenemos las Denominaciones de Origen del Vino, está en la recta final la del Aceite y hemos iniciado los trámites para la del Tomate Rosa. En concreto, una regulación estatal de similares características”.\nIniciativa\nDesde que el proyecto se puso en marcha en 2009 por iniciativa de Javier Betorz, primer presidente de la Asociación de Hortelanos de Barbastro, quien aunó criterios y voluntades necesarias para sacarlo adelante, la producción total es de 21.300.000 kilos entre 2009-2024. En opinión de Óscar Olivera “es momento de que los productores decidan si están dentro de la Asociación o fuera de ella, por lo tanto, no es posible dar cifras de producción estimada sobre la campaña próxima” al menos por ahora.\nEn la Asociación hay trece productores, “pequeños en su mayoría, pero ha aumentado la actividad de mujeres con sus respectivas explotaciones y están entre las más grandes por superficie”. En la comarca de Somontano, también en Aragón, la mayor explotación es de la empresa oscense Terra Agronómica por superficie y producción, además dispone de una nave para selección en el Polígono Industrial Valle del Cinca.\nLos primeros tomates de la próxima campaña se degustarán el día 20 de junio con motivo de la Fiesta de San Ramón, entre las actividades organizadas por la Cofradía que incluyen degustaciones.\nLa cita más próxima será en la XIII Fiesta del Plantero, el domingo 11 de mayo en la plaza del Mercado (10 a 14 horas) en colaboración con el Ayuntamiento a través del Área de Desarrollo. Está prevista la distribución gratuita de 2.000 plantas, participarán ocho expositores de productos, y se han organizado actividades y talleres.",

At just 19 years old, [Gracey Hemstreet](/ca-en/athlete/gracey-hemstreet)made mountain biking history at the first-ever [Red Bull Hardline Australia](/ca-en/events/red-bull-hard-line-australia)event this weekend. The Canadian youngster hit the headlines after becoming the first-ever woman to complete a full run of the notorious Red Bull Hardline, a race that's become a legend for its ruthless, limit-testing downhill challenges. For the first time, the event moved away from its home in Wales to host a second race at Maydena Bike Park, in Tasmania. It was there that Hemstreet etched her name into the annals of history, showcasing her skills to navigate the high-speed course's monstrous jumps, drops and technical sections from top to bottom. The 2022 junior downhill world champ even received the coveted Rider of the Week award for her ground-breaking exploits. Hemstreet had an incredible week in Australia, which speaks volumes about her mental fortitude and ability to handle the high speeds and massive features that littered the course. During the week's practice sessions, her rear wheel was destroyed on landing a big step-up jump, leading to a heavy crash. Nonetheless, she recovered to complete the course and line up for the qualifying runs, where she became one of the first two women to ever qualify for the finals of a Red Bull Hardline, alongside Scottish rider Louise Ferguson. This downhill is the best moment of my life Big names like [Tahnée Seagrave](/ca-en/athlete/tahnee-seagrave), [Harriet Burbidge-Smith](/ca-en/athlete/harriet-burbidge-smith), [Hannah Bergemann](/ca-en/athlete/hannah-bergemann)and Cami Nogueira also participated in practice session and qualifications, but only Hemstreet and Ferguson managed to complete the entire course and reach finals. Leading the charge in the finals, the Canadian executed a flawless run, tackling the 10m-plus drops and landing smoothly over the cavernous 23m gap jump at the finish line. Her finishing time of 3m 56.586s stood as the fastest women's time of the day, but more importantly a historic moment in women's mountain biking history. \"This victory means a lot to me,\" Hemstreet declared at the finish line. \"This downhill is the best moment of my life. I played it safe, but the last jump with the wind was insane. I had a blast going down this track.\" After it's debut in Australia, [Red Bull Hardline is set to return to its Welsh roots on June 1–2](/ca-en/events/red-bull-hardline-uk)for a monumental 10th-anniversary event and Hemstreet will have the opportunity to shine once more. \"We’ve seen so much progress by enabling female athletes to ride,\" reminded Tahnée Seagrave recently. \"We're approaching it in the right way, working towards supporting the progression at an attainable speed, so that more girls can eventually get to tackle the course.\" Part of this story Red Bull Hardline Red Bull Hardline, the world’s toughest mountain bike race, adds a new event in Tasmania, Australia, as well as reaching its 10-year milestone in the Dyfi Valley, Wales.",

Stock photo.\nImage: 123RF/Surut Wattanamaetee\nAbout 60% scattered and 80% widespread showers and thundershowers are expected across the central and eastern regions of South Africa from Sunday to at least Wednesday.\nAccording to the SA Weather Service (Saws), this includes the North West, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and the southern parts of Mpumalanga and Gauteng.\nThe weather service has issued an alert to motorists returning home after the holidays, pedestrians and the public to be aware of the heavy rain.\nThe amounts of rain expected range from 50mm to 70mm.\n“Road flooding, slippery surfaces and broad flash flooding are possible. The use of vehicle headlights while driving at a reasonably low speed will be useful during the showery conditions. Motorists should ensure clear windscreens as traffic and road markings could be difficult to see during heavy rain, even for vehicles with properly working wipers, in some instances.”\nSaws warned that some low-water bridges may overflow, creating strong currents that could sweep away vehicles, posing a risk of loss of life and property.\nMotorists have been advised not to enter flooded low-water bridges or roads.\nAccording to Saws, summer thundershowers are usually confined to the afternoon and early evenings.\nHowever, the ongoing flow of warm, moist air (tropical moisture) from northern countries is expected to bring showers throughout the day. This could lead to ordinary or even heavy showers occurring between 6pm and 1am as well.\n“According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), these are the critical hours [during which] road users should avoid driving. This festive season a higher number of road fatalities than in previous years has already been reported and the Saws, in collaboration with the RTMC, urges motorists, pedestrians and the public to be extra vigilant and careful on the roads during these conditions.”\nRainfall distribution is expected to remain scattered to widespread across the central and eastern regions of the country on Monday.\nThese conditions are expected to be accompanied by localised flooding across the North West, Free State and Gauteng as well as the western Bushveld of Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.\nThe adverse weather conditions are expected to persist until Wednesday over the northeastern and eastern provinces, where potential flooding can be expected.\nTimesLIVE",
