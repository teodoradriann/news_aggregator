    "text": "By Jonathan Gallardo Gillette News Record Via Wyoming News Exchange ,\n2 hours ago\nGILLETTE — The Campbell County commissioners are planning to push back against a proposed rule by the federal government that would essentially end coal leasing in the Powder River Basin.\nTuesday, at a public hearing during the commissioners’ regular meeting, local residents and government officials voiced their concerns and frustrations with the Bureau of Land Management, which in May announced its intent to not allow any new federal coal leases.\nThe plan targets the Powder River Basin and its 12 Wyoming coal mines, which are all located in Campbell County, and would allow mines to operate through 2041 under current leases.\nCommissioner Jim Ford said this rule has been more than eight years in the making and that this decision will “project an end date for mining in our community.”\nCommission Chair Del Shelstad said coal production in Campbell County has sent billions of dollars to the state over the years.\n\"That’s why we expect the state of Wyoming to start this fight with us and help us with this,\" he said. \"I can trust that they’re smart enough to do this.\"\nCommissioners will be submitting a protest letter, and they are asking Campbell County residents to sign an online petition, which is available at tinyurl.com/yeyn686d .\nGillette Mayor Shay Lundvall said the city will “stand shoulder to shoulder” with the county to fight this proposal and keep coal leasing alive.\nRep. John Bear, R-Gillette, said Campbell County needs to go on the offensive.\n“I don’t believe this (Biden) administration is interested in listening to the complaints and objections,” he said.\nHe said this fight needs to happen in court and that Wyoming needs to lead that fight and “do it in such a serious way that they quit picking on Wyoming.”\nRep. Chris Knapp, R-Gillette, said this “won’t be the last of it,” adding that there only will be more rule changes coming from the federal government that will make life harder in Wyoming.\nGillette resident Mark Junek said there’s “too much complacency in our community” on this issue, and that the BLM rule change will affect everyone, even if they’re not directly working in the coal industry.\nGeorge Dunlap said Gillette wouldn’t be the community it is today if people decades ago had sat back instead of taking action. He said he’s hopeful about the effects the presidential election could have.\n“Who knows what’s going to happen if Donald Trump gets elected, we may have a chance to save this country, we may have a chance to save Wyoming and save Campbell County,” he said.",
