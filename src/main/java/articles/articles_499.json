    "title": "American Family Association founder Don Wildmon dies at 85",
    "text": "A pioneer of the pro-family movement, Rev. Donald Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association and American Family Radio, passed away Thursday, Dec. 28, in Tupelo, Miss., at age 85.\nWildmon, born in 1938, started out as a pastor, serving as a United Methodist minister for 13 years. However, as the AFA's website notes, in the late 1970s, troubled by the profanity and indecency he saw on television, Wildmon founded the Mississippi-based American Family Association – at first, from his kitchen table. A decade and a half later, in 1991, the AFA spun off American Family Radio, which currently has 1.5 to 2 two million listeners.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\nWildmon's son and current AFA president, Tim Wildmon, said his father's many accomplishments in pursuit of preserving America's traditional, moral, family-oriented culture never went to his head. \"Those were the visions that God gave him to start,\" said Tim, \"and he was a servant of the Lord and he followed through with what the Lord gave him to do.\"\nTRENDING:\nCan the McCloskeys get their guns back? Judges pull trigger on ruling\nOthers offered heartfelt remembrances of Wildmon and his lasting impact on America:\nPastor Bert Harper of \"Exploring the Word\" on American Family Radio, and who spent years on AFA's board of directors, told American Family News, \"Brother Don Wildmon was a visionary. He could see down the road 10 years ahead of time.\"\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nDr. Alex McFarland, Harper's co-host of \"Exploring the Word,\" called Wildmon \"an amazingly influential, wonderfully faithful\" man of God, adding: \"In the late 1970s, as our nation was beginning a moral and spiritual decline, God raised up some leaders who would ultimately change the world and our nation for the good. Certainly, one of the most prominent was the late Dr. Don Wildmon. … He set in motion an influence for the gospel that only God could measure. What a legacy he leaves, what an example for us all.\"\nTed Beahr, chairman of the Christian Film & Television Commission and editor of Movieguide, said: \"Don had an ability to not just target the exact right problem, but he also had ability to galvanize people.\"\nDr. James Dobson, founder of \"Focus on the Family\" and currently host of \"Family Talk,\" said the biggest driver of Wildmon's legacy would be his courage, telling AFN: \"I think it would be his fearlessness in taking on big corporations and the powerful executives who scared everybody else.\"\nLikewise, Dr. Robert Jeffress, senior pastor of the huge First Baptist Dallas church, and who hosts a daily radio program on AFR, commented: \"Don Wildmon was a true pioneer in encouraging pastors like myself and thousands of others to speak out on the great moral issues of the day. He will be sorely missed by a country that needs him more than ever right now. We pray for the Wildmon family, and wish them every encouragement from Heaven that they will see Don again in Heaven, with all of the rewards he deserves.\"\nAnd AFA executive vice president Ed Vitagliano summarized the loss of Donald Wildmon this way:\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\"Bro. Don Wildmon was an extraordinary man and an extraordinary figure in American culture. Because of the humility of Brother Don, sometimes it is hard to gauge the impact he had – but his vision for a Christian community that was active in politics and culture was part of a movement we believe of the Holy Spirit in this country.\"\n\"It was not just Brother Don; it was Jerry Falwell and Dr. James Dobson and Phyllis Schlafly and others who understood the direction that this country was taking and knew that the Church had to speak up – that the Church could not censor itself and be paralyzed by a culture that wanted to intimidate the Christian community and make them silent.\n\"Brother Don's vision was huge in our culture, extremely influential, and because he and his wife, Lynda, raised strong children, strong in the Christian faith, who now have grandchildren who continue that legacy, AFA and AFR continue the vision and the passion of Brother Don to see this nation return to a place of faithfulness to God that we might be a nation once again whose God is the Lord.\"\n\"It is sad for those of us here at AFA and AFR. This really is like a family. This is a hard moment, a difficult moment for us, very sad, but we also believe in the resurrection and the power of God to take away – through the resurrection of Christ – the sting of death. We know Bro. Don is in Heaven with his Lord who he served faithfully and with others in his family, others that he knows from that movement to get people involved in culture. We are happy for Brother Don and we do covet the prayers of our faithful listeners and supporters for the Wildmon family and for this ministry. We continue to ask them to pray for our nation and pray that God might send a revival and an awakening that will restore the biblical foundations of this country.\"\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nIMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere.\nDemocrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as \"infanticide.\" They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a \"gender transition\" that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border.\nTheir standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America's economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as \"violent extremists,\" \"domestic terrorists,\" \"white supremacists\" and \"insurrectionists.\" Indeed, they're currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden's chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nNone of this constitutes \"politics\" in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil.\nThe big question, then, is WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE AMERICA? Fortunately, real answers and uncommon wisdom are showcased in the December issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine,\n\"CAN AMERICA BE SAVED? The world's freest, most Christian nation is on the brink of destruction.\"\nIn this very special issue, readers will experience the best and deepest thoughts and strategies on how to restore America to her former goodness and greatness, from some of the nation's most respected analysts – everyone from Tucker Carlson to Dennis Prager to Victor Davis Hanson to Newt Gingrich and many more.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nWHISTLEBLOWER is available in\nboth the popular print edition and a state-of-the-art digital version, either single issues or discounted annual subscriptions.\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

    "text": "LifeLabs workers in the Greater Toronto Area could soon walk off the job if a deal isn’t reached with their employer.\nOPSEU/SEFPO, which represents members of Local 5119 and Local 298, issued a news release Wednesday on behalf of its couriers and mail room clerks operating out LifeLabs locations across Kitchener and the GTA – including Toronto, Mississauga, Peel, Oshawa, Durham, Halton, York, and Vaughan.\nThe union said their workers could go on strike as soon as Saturday due to the “lack of dependable futures” at LifeLabs, with picket lines going up Tuesday.\n\"LifeLabs is a billion-dollar, for-profit company that gets millions of our public health care dollars,\" OPSEU/SEFPO President JP Hornick said.\n\"It can absolutely afford to treat workers fairly – yet even full-time workers are struggling to pay rent as some of the lowest paid employees in the company. … How are you supposed to keep up with the cost of living when your rent hike is higher than your wage increase?\"\nIn an email to CTV News Toronto on Thursday, LifeLabs stated that it is currently negotiating a renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with the union.\n\"We remain committed to working to achieve a reasonable, responsible, and sustainable agreement,\" a spokesperson from LifeLabs said.\n\"In the event of a strike, LifeLabs will take all possible actions to minimize disruption to customers and healthcare providers. We will implement a business continuity plan to ensure that we can continue to provide Ontarians with access to important health care services.\"\nThe spokesperson added that the company's patient services centres will remain open, and laboratories will continue to function as usual in the event of a strike.\nThe union said LifeLabs mail clerks process all incoming and outgoing deliveries, while couriers pick up tens of thousands of blood samples and other test specimens from hospitals, doctors' offices, and pharmacies every day and deliver them to LifeLabs laboratories for testing.\nTed Rietveld, president of OPSEU/SEFPO Local 298, says unionized workers feel like they're being “pushed out” due to LifeLabs contracting out to third-party, agency work.\n\"We have experienced couriers and mail clerks in-house that closely follow protocols around safe handling and transport of test specimens to preserve the integrity of the sample,\" he said.\n\"But the company has no issues recruiting agency workers and handing them a LifeLabs t-shirt so the public can't tell the difference.\"\nMahmood Alawneh, president of OPSEU/SEFPO Local 5119 and a LifeLabs courier working out of Toronto, said in the news release on Wednesday that LifeLabs is “eroding working conditions\n\"The public relies on us every day as part of their care,\" Alawneh added.\n\"We hope that we can rely on the public in turn as we fight for the careers we deserve – good jobs, not gig work.\"",

    "text": "Ciudad del Vaticano, 10 mar (Prensa Latina) El papa Francisco mantiene hoy su esperanza en «una solución diplomática para una paz justa y duradera” en Ucrania, señaló la oficina de prensa vaticana al\naclarar el contenido de sus declaraciones a un medio suizo.\nEn una reciente entrevista concedida a la Radio y Televisión Suiza (RSI), Francisco retomó “la imagen de la bandera blanca propuesta por el entrevistador” para “indicar con ella el cese de las hostilidades, la tregua alcanzada con el coraje de la negociación”, enfatizó el director de esa oficina, Matteo Bruni.\nEntre sus preguntas al Pontífice, el periodista de ese medio suizo, Lorenzo Buccella, cuestionó al mismo que “en Ucrania hay quienes piden coraje para rendirse, por la bandera blanca, pero otros dicen que esto legitimaría a los más fuertes. ¿Qué opinas?”.\nFrancisco expresó al respecto que “es una interpretación, pero creo que son más fuertes quienes ven la situación, quienes piensan en el pueblo, quienes tienen el coraje de izar la bandera blanca y negociar”, y añadió que “hoy se puede negociar con la ayuda de las potencias internacionales”.\n“La palabra negociar es una palabra valiente. Cuando ves que estás derrotado, que las cosas no van bien, necesitas tener el coraje de negociar. Te da vergüenza, pero ¿con cuántas muertes terminará? Negociar a tiempo, buscar algún país que actúe como mediador”, expresó el obispo de Roma.\nEl papa puso como ejemplo el ofrecimiento en tal sentido del gobierno de Turkiye, de mediar para poner fin al conflicto en Ucrania, tras lo cual consideró que “no te avergüences de negociar antes de que las cosas empeoren” y posteriormente, refiriéndose a cualquier situación de guerra, apuntó que “negociar nunca es una rendición”.\nBruni argumentó que se trata de “palabras del Papa extraídas de una imagen propuesta por el entrevistador para reiterar, entre otras cosas, lo que ya se ha dicho en estos dos años de continuos llamamientos y pronunciamientos públicos, a saber, la importancia del diálogo contra la locura de la guerra”.\n“La esperanza del Papa es y sigue siendo la misma que siempre se ha repetido en los últimos años” a favor de que “se encuentre ese pedacito de humanidad que nos permita crear las condiciones para una solución diplomática en busca de una paz justa y duradera”, agregó el portavoz del Vaticano.",

    "text": "The Ultimate Guide to Mould Cleaning Services Mould is a common household problem that can cause significant health issues and damage to property if not properly addressed. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of [mould cleaning services](http://mouldclean.co.uk), including what they are, why they are important, and how to choose the right service provider. Additionally, we will touch upon the related topic of builders cleaning services, which can be crucial in preventing mould growth in new or renovated buildings. Understanding Mould and Its Impact What is Mould? Mould is a type of fungus that thrives in damp, warm, and humid conditions. It reproduces through tiny spores that float through the air and can settle on various surfaces. When these spores find a suitable environment, they begin to grow and multiply, forming visible colonies. Common types of mould found in homes include Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Stachybotrys chartarum (black mould). Health Risks of Mould Exposure to mould can lead to a variety of health issues, particularly for individuals with respiratory conditions, allergies, or weakened immune systems. Symptoms of mould exposure include coughing, Nicotine Odour Removal Services, skin rashes, and eye irritation. Prolonged exposure can exacerbate asthma and lead to more severe respiratory problems. Structural Damage Beyond health risks, mould can cause significant structural damage to buildings. It can weaken walls, ceilings, and floors, leading to costly repairs. Mould can also ruin personal belongings, including furniture, clothing, and electronics. What Are Mould Cleaning Services? Mould cleaning services are professional services designed to remove mould from residential and commercial properties. These services typically involve a thorough inspection, identification of the mould type, containment of affected areas, removal of mould colonies, and remediation to prevent future growth. Inspection and Identification The first step in mould cleaning services is a comprehensive inspection. Professionals use specialized tools to detect moisture levels and identify the extent of mould infestation. They may also take samples to determine the specific type of mould present, which can influence the cleaning approach. Containment To prevent the spread of mould spores during the cleaning process, affected areas are contained. This may involve sealing off rooms with plastic sheeting and using negative air pressure to keep spores from dispersing to other parts of the building. Mould Removal The actual removal of mould involves cleaning and disinfecting affected surfaces. Depending on the severity of the infestation, this can range from wiping down surfaces with antimicrobial solutions to removing and replacing contaminated materials like drywall and insulation. Remediation After mould removal, remediation efforts focus on addressing the underlying causes of mould growth. This may involve repairing leaks, improving ventilation, and installing dehumidifiers to reduce humidity levels. Remediation ensures that mould does not return in the future. The Importance of Professional Mould Cleaning Services Expertise and Equipment Professional mould cleaning services have the expertise and equipment necessary to effectively address mould problems. They use industrial-grade cleaning agents and specialized tools to ensure thorough removal. Professionals are also trained to handle mould safely, minimizing health risks to themselves and occupants of the building. Comprehensive Approach DIY mould cleaning methods may not address the root causes of mould growth, leading to recurring issues. Professional services take a comprehensive approach, identifying and addressing both the visible mould and the underlying moisture problems. This ensures a long-term solution rather than a temporary fix. Health and Safety Mould cleaning can be hazardous, especially for individuals with health conditions. Professional services follow strict safety protocols to protect both their workers and the building's occupants. They use personal protective equipment (PPE) and employ methods to contain and remove mould without spreading spores. Choosing the Right Mould Cleaning Service Experience and Reputation When selecting a mould cleaning service, consider their experience and reputation. Look for companies with a proven track record of successfully handling mould problems. Check online reviews and ask for references to gauge customer satisfaction. Certifications and Training Reputable mould cleaning services should have certifications from recognized organizations such as the Institute of Inspection, Cleaning, and Restoration Certification (IICRC). Certification ensures that technicians are trained in the latest mould remediation techniques and follow industry standards. Comprehensive Services Choose a service provider that offers comprehensive mould cleaning services, including inspection, removal, and remediation. A company that addresses both the immediate mould problem and the underlying causes will provide a more effective and long-lasting solution. Transparency and Communication A good mould cleaning service should be transparent about their process and costs. They should provide a detailed estimate and clearly explain each step of the remediation plan. Open communication ensures that you understand what to expect and can make informed decisions. Builders Cleaning Services and Mould Prevention What Are Builders Cleaning Services?

Builders cleaning services include the removal of construction debris, dust, and other residues left behind by builders. Importance of Builders Cleaning Services Effective builders cleaning services are crucial for preventing mould growth in new or renovated buildings. Construction materials, such as wood, drywall, and insulation, can retain moisture and create ideal conditions for mould if not properly cleaned and dried. Builders cleaning services address these issues, reducing the risk of future mould problems.
