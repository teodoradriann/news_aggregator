    "title": "Prisma Health plans $138M behavioral health hospital - GREENVILLE JOURNAL",
    "text": "Prisma Health has unveiled plans to build a $138 million inpatient behavioral health hospital in Upstate South Carolina.\nThe three-story hospital will address the rising need for behavioral health services in the Upstate. According to Prisma Health, the number of patients admitted for psychiatrist treatment has steadily increased in the region over the past six years.\nA statewide need for 211 additional inpatient behavioral health beds was also identified in the recent State Health Plan. Gov. Henry McMaster said the inpatient and outpatient services in South Carolina are “woefully insufficient” in supporting patients.\n“This project is an important step forward in addressing the statewide need for an expansion of behavioral health services whenever and wherever possible,” McMaster said.\nThe new 132,430-square-foot facility will be built on 46 acres at the corner of U.S. Highway 123 and S.C. Highway 153 in Pickens County. It will be licensed for 112 inpatient beds. Each patient care unit will include private and semi-private rooms.\nThe South Carolina General Assembly will appropriate $100 million to the state Department of Health and Human Services to support the new hospital. Mark O’Halla , president and CEO of Prisma Health, said the project is only possible due to the state’s investment.\n“This project is a powerful example of what we can accomplish through public-private partnerships and is a significant and much-needed step forward for our communities and state,” O’Halla said.\nExpanding care\nThe new behavioral health hospital will replace Prisma Health’s 65-bed Marshall I. Pickens Psychiatric Hospital in Greenville.\nBuilt in 1969, it is the only Upstate hospital that admits patients aged 12 and younger. It serves around 1,500 patients per year. Due to the hospital’s limited capacity, approximately 1,200 patients in need of inpatient psychiatric care must be transported to a facility outside the Upstate each year.\nThe new hospital will double Prisma’s inpatient capacity with 40 beds for children and 72 beds for adults. Specialized care will be provided for children, adolescents, adults, older adults and those who require more intensive care.\nKaren Lommel, the Robert A. Jolley Jr. Endowed Chair of Psychiatry and Community Health for Prisma Health in the Upstate, said patients experiencing a mental health crisis deserve expert, compassionate care in a healing, nurturing environment.\n“Our new hospital will significantly increase access to this vitally needed care but will also keep families closer to home and their family-friend networks which can itself help in recovery,” Lommel said.\nPrisma Health is currently completing architectural and construction documents for the new facility. The health care system has also applied for a Certificate of Need from the state, a requirement to commence construction. If approved, site work is expected to begin in the spring of 2025. Construction is estimated to take around two years to complete.\nIn addition to the new hospital, Prisma plans to spend $7 million on facility projects for the Greenville Memorial Campus associated with behavioral health services. This includes expanding intensive outpatient programs offered at the site.",

She’s absolutely phenomenal in the ring. Sol Ruca, she’s phenomenal in the ring and just seeing the way that these ladies move – there’s a lot of promise over there, and I hope that some of the ladies in the TNA locker room get to mix it up with a lot of them.”\nBlanchard recently discussed talks she had with TNA about a possible return to the promotion in 2024.

    "text": "Si è spenta a soli 19 anni Beandri Booysen . La ragazza soffriva di una malattia rara e incurabile, la sindrome di Hutchinson-Gilford, che l’ha fatta invecchiare di otto anni per ogni anno. In tutto il mondo sono 200 le persone affette da questo male.\nBeandri era originaria di Pretoria, in Sudafrica, e – secondo gli specialisti – non avrebbe dovuto vivere oltre i 14 anni, ma ha fatto di tutto per abbattere questo limite e piano piano ha allungato le sue aspettative di vita. È lo stesso caso del nostro Sammy Basso, morto il 5 ottobre scorso .\nDue mesi fa Beandri è stata sottoposta a un intervento chirurgico a cuore aperto e si stava riprendendo. Era determinata a trascorrere il Natale con i suoi genitori. La madre di Beandri, Bea, a sorpresa però ha confermato sulla pagina Facebook della figlia di aver perso la sua battaglia per la vita il 18 dicembre e ha ringraziato tutti i suoi fan in tutto il mondo per averla “amata profondamente”.\n“È con profonda tristezza che annunciamo la scomparsa di Beandri, – ha scritto la donna – una delle giovani donne più amate e stimolanti del Sudafrica, che ha sempre irradiato speranza e gioia. Beandri non era nota solo per la sua personalità e la sua risata contagiosa, ma anche come l’ultima persona sopravvissuta in Sudafrica a convivere con la rara malattia genetica Progeria . È diventata un simbolo di consapevolezza per la Progeria e altri bambini con bisogni speciali, usando il suo spirito unico per ispirare migliaia di persone in tutto il mondo. Non ha mai smesso di lottare”.\n(Foto tratta dal Facebook di Beandri Booysen)",

    "text": "JACKSON, Wyo. — A second appearance of the aurora borealis over Jackson in the same week? It’s looking likely! A severe geomagnetic storm watch has been issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) following the eruption of a coronal mass ejection from the sun on Oct. 8. The G4 storm is predicted to reach a Kp index of 8.33 overnight on Thursday, Oct. 10, likely making the Northern Lights visible over northern states including Wyoming. SWPC noted that reaching G5 (extreme) storm levels remains possible. Derived from the German “Planetarische Kennziffer,” or planetary index, the Kp scale runs from zero to nine. As explained by Wyoming Stargazing, the Kp index “measures the disruption of the horizontal distribution of the geomagnetic activity…A value of zero means that even Fairbanks, Alaska, would have difficulty in seeing the northern lights. One to three is most common, and that’s what is frequently seen in those northern latitudes of northern Canada and Alaska. A four would push them down into southern Canada, while a five, in the right conditions, might just barely be visible on the northern horizon here in Jackson Hole. To see them well, we typically need at least a six.” Monday night’s display was the result of a Kp index peaking at 7.33. In May , the Kp index reached 9. The National Weather Service’s Riverton Office forecasts patchy fog in northwestern Wyoming on Thursday night, however, and wildfire smoke could affect visibility. The waxing quarter moon might also be a factor. Even if viewing conditions are perfect, it’s difficult to predict the aurora with much certainty. “Space weather is very fickle,” National Weather Service Riverton Meteorologist Chris Hattings has said about the aurora in past forecasts. To try to view the aurora, head to a very dark place away from light pollution and allow the eyes to adjust, which could take 15 to 30 minutes. Turn to the north-northeast and look at the horizon. Keep an eye on the Space Weather Prediction Center to see how the forecast evolves.",

Lo ha annunciato la stessa franchigia statunitense.\nIl problema di salute è stato diagnosticato \"al ritorno di Wembanyama a San Antonio dopo l'All Star Game a San Franscisco\", dove il giocatore ventunenne ha partecipato lo scorso fine settimana per la prima volta nella sua carriera, ha precisato la franchigia texana in un comunicato.\nIl rientro in campo è previsto ad aprile, quando la stagione regolare sarà già conclusa. E difficilmente gli Spurs si qualificheranno per i playoff. Il francese potrebbe però disputare Euro-2025 con la sua nazionale dal 27 agosto al 14 settembre: i blues sono impegnati con Lettonia, Cipro, Finlandia e Polonia.\n© Riproduzione riservata\nContinua a leggere tutte le notizie di sport su",

    "text": "[Business of climate change](/topics/business-climate-change) [Learn more](/mynews?module=myNEWS_text&pgtype=article) Green Tech: Tetra Pak helps Chinese dairy firms automate production, cut energy and water usage, carbon emissions - Food packaging giant Tetra Pak implements a programme for reducing energy, waste, and the usage of water and chemicals associated with the equipment it sells - The company plans to tap demand for alternative protein by selling equipment to help Chinese companies make products with smaller greenhouse gas footprints than meat China’s dairy industry – the world’s fourth largest – is fast embracing automation and innovation to become more efficient and sustainable, and food packaging and equipment giant Tetra Pak is helping drive this change which is aimed at not only cutting production costs, but also at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. “China has been a very important driver for innovation in dairy in the last couple of decades,” Charles Brand, Tetra Pak’s executive vice-president of processing solutions and equipment told the Post, referring to the country’s large scale dairy farms and processing plants, which have adopted modern technology for efficiency gains. “One of the big things happening there is automation, in which we are working with customers on making dairy manufacturing fully intelligent,” he said. Established in Lund, Sweden in 1951 and now Switzerland-headquartered, Tetra Pak is a privately-owned firm which makes equipment for manufacturing cheese, ice-cream, dairy milk powder and alternative protein, besides cartons. Higher energy and water costs, caused by geopolitical and extreme climate events, have prompted food producers to upgrade their production facilities for efficiency gains, and for energy and resource usage reduction, said Brand. “Heat pumps, solar technologies for both electricity and heating, besides water and chemicals recovery and recycling solutions, are all becoming an important part of all food manufacturers’ thinking when it comes to cost savings,” Brand said. “That on one hand has a sustainability impact, but today there is also return on investment that goes with that.” [A Chinese start-up is turning yeast into alternative dairy products](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3222970/shanghai-start-changing-bio-turns-yeast-alternative-dairy-products-meet-chinas-surging-protein?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) The company has in recent years implemented a programme for reducing energy, waste, and the usage of water and chemicals associated with the equipment it sells, to address the challenges its customers face in reducing their environmental impact, he said. For each type of equipment, it has set targets to help customers’ facilities halve their greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation and water usage by 2030, compared to levels in the baseline year of 2019, he noted. It has recently launched a milk separator that uses 40 per cent less energy than semi-open separators, while the latest milk sterilisation equipment has a 38 per cent smaller carbon footprint and uses 41 per cent less water, he added. Tetra Pak posted revenue of €12.5 billion (US$11.7 billion) in 2022, with 36 per cent coming from Asia-Pacific. Its main food processing equipment factory in China is located in Kunshan, Jiangsu province. One such facility in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region, the world’s single largest liquid milk factory that came on stream last May, delivered a 67 per cent improvement in packaging efficiency, a 43 per cent energy consumption reduction and a 19 per cent total production cost reduction, he noted. Its owner, China Mengniu Dairy, was driven by a desire to rank among the most cost-efficient producers in the industry globally, besides posting sustainability benefits, he added. “Many of the technologies deployed in China have already been utilised in Europe, but the combination of large production scale, digitalisation and automation being put into one place is unique,” he said, adding this involved data and sensor-driven production and quality monitoring and optimisation. Tetra Pak distributed 193 billion aseptic cartons in 2022. Out of these, 8.8 billion packages and 11.9 billion caps used plant-based plastic, 24 per cent and 12 per cent more than in 2021, respectively. Some 131,000 tonnes of carbon emissions were avoided through the replacement of fossil plastic, it estimated. Brand said that most cartons it makes now are composed of 70 per cent paperboard, 25 per cent plastic and 5 per cent aluminium. It aims to invest €100 million annually in the next five to 10 years to raise the paper content to 80 per cent, remove metal usage and to introduce plant-based plastic. In doing so, the renewable content of its output could reach 90 per cent from 70 per cent, and the carbon footprint could be cut by a third. The liquid food packaging and processing company, known more for its aseptic cartons that preserve milk and juices, is also playing a role in China’s food sufficiency drive. Brand said his company plans to tap the growing market demand for alternative protein such as plant-based or laboratory-cultivated food, by supplying equipment such as bioreactors to help Chinese companies manufacture products that have lower greenhouse gas footprints than meat. “Our intent is to support the growth of these new food sources with the equipment that we have,” he said. “China is likely to be a big market for alternative protein, which is about enhancing food security and finding efficient and safe ways of feeding the population.”",

    "text": "I used to work the night shift and I never got enough sleep. I’d get impatient and I was tired all day. I’m 45 and I was feeling bad about myself. I’d eat a lot of sweets and I weighed about 239 pounds. My husband Jason and I have a 14-year-old son, Korey, and a six-year-old daughter, Jaycee. And I have a grown daughter, Kalley. But I didn’t have enough energy for my family. Two co-workers were Thrive Challenge winners, so I decided to get started. I knew I’d have a lot of good support. What really helped me was transferring to a new position at Walmart. Now, instead of working nights, I work the 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift, which means I can go to sleep at a decent time. The first thing I did was set up a nighttime routine. After dinner, I’ll give Jaycee a bath and we’ll read together, like a Diary of A Wimpy Kid book or a Dr. Seuss book. Once the kids are in bed, I take a relaxing bath with epsom salts. I put my phone away to charge in the living room. Then I lie down in bed, read for a little while, and fall asleep. I feel refreshed in the morning. The first thing I do is write in my journal. I write about my feelings, thoughts, and my hopes. Every day, I post a positive quote on Facebook. It might be, “Just one small positive thought in the morning can change your whole day” or, “Don’t focus on who let you down. Appreciate who lifted you up.” I make sure I move throughout the day. That improves my mood. I feel more accomplished in my job because I have more energy — I like keeping busy and learning new things. I strive to do my best and just recently I won an award at work. The certificate says: “Jamie’s positive attitude has been a huge benefit in customer interactions.” Since my hours changed, I’ve been spending more time with my family. My kids are homeschooled. Jason does the majority of the work with them, but I jump in and I’ll help Korey with a problem if he needs me. We have a bunch of board games we play together. My daughter and I do art activities together. I take her to gymnastics, and we love to dance and be silly together. On my days off, I take Jaycee swimming and we go to the park. She loves to ride her bike or scooter. As a family when the weather’s good, we enjoy going to Miller Woods for a hike. Jaycee and I look at the pond and all the different bugs. My husband cooks for us and we’re eating better. He’ll make tacos with high-fiber, low-carb tortillas, or grass-fed, organic hamburgers with green beans. I’ve slowly cut most sweets out of my diet. For a good food swap, instead of candy I might eat a piece of cheese or fruit. I only have ice cream once in a while as a treat. One Microstep I’m taking is not eating late at night. My cut-off time is 7 p.m. I’ve lost 40 pounds and I feel much better. With Thrive, I’ve learned that I need to take care of myself. I’m a mom and a wife, and I always want to take care of everyone else. Now I know it’s okay to put myself first, to give myself a break, read a book, or get a pedicure. I tell myself I’m worth it. I’m a good person who deserves happiness. My husband and I are connecting. I was in an abusive relationship years ago, and I never felt good enough. But Jason and I have been together for 18 years, and he treats me very well. We love spending time together. After dinner, we’ll watch a movie. I’ve just been watching all the Indiana Jones movies with him because he really likes them, and he’ll watch girlie movies with me. I tell my husband and kids how much I appreciate and love them. You never know when the last time will be to let people know how much you truly love them. Life is precious, things could change in an instant, and I’m so grateful for my life. It’s not perfect — but life isn’t perfect. And I feel so much happier. — Jamie Saxton, Walmart Store #1843, Mcminnville, OR; $5K Winner",

    "text": "Europas neue Wettersatelliten-Flotte soll am 12. August Zuwachs bekommen: Erst Anfang Juli wurde ein moderner Satellit namens \"Meteosat Third Generation sounding satellite\" (MTG-S1) lanciert, nun folgt der Erstling der zweiten Generation von Europas Metop-Satelliten namens \"Metop-SGA1\". Mit an Bord ist auch die Sonde \"Sentinel-5\", ein zusätzlicher Teil von Europas Erdbeobachtungsprogramm \"Copernicus\". Die Daten des Duos sollen Wetter- und Klimaprognosen verbessern.\nDas sukzessive Starten der neuen Satelliten mit \"sehr komplexen Instrumenten\" an Bord sei für die beteiligten Organisationen, aber auch für die vielen Behörden und Wissenschafter, die mit einschlägigen Daten arbeiten, \"eine sehr aufregende Zeit\", sagte der Generaldirektor der europäischen meteorologischen Satellitenagentur (EUMETSAT), Phil Evans, vor Journalisten. Angesichts von ungefähr 50.000 hitzeassoziierten Toten im Jahr 2023 in Europa und einem klimawandelbedingten deutlichen Anstieg von Extremwetterereignissen brauche es dringend detailliertere Informationen zu den Abläufen in der Atmosphäre. Simon Brown von der britischen Wetterbehörde MetOffice verwies in dem Zusammenhang auf die Extremniederschläge im spanischen Valencia und im September 2024 in Ostösterreich. Um vor derartigen Ereignissen besser warnen zu können, brauche es vor allem kontinuierliche Messungen, die es erlauben, die Wetter- und Klimamodelle zu verbessern.\nTechnik aus Wien mit an Bord\n\"Europa sollte sehr stolz darauf sein\", dass dies mit Programmen, wie den von der EU-Kommission über die europäische Weltraumagentur ESA abgewickelten Copernicus-Erdbeobachtungssystemen so möglich ist, betonte Brown. Metop-SGA1 und Co seien auch ein \"Meisterstück europäischer Technologie und Kooperation\", so Evans, der auf insgesamt 17 beteiligte Länder und 110 Unternehmen verwies, die an dem neuen Satelliten mitgearbeitet haben. Darunter ist auch die Wiener Weltraumfirma Beyond Gravity, die die Thermalisolation der Sonde beisteuerte, die rund siebeneinhalb Jahre Daten liefern soll. Außerdem zeichnet der Raumfahrtzulieferer für die Elektronik eines der zentralen Wetterdateninstrumente des Satelliten verantwortlich. Komponenten davon \"wurden von uns in Wien entwickelt und gebaut\", wird Beyond Gravity-Geschäftsführer Kurt Kober in einer Aussendung zitiert.\nBis alle Instrumente verlässlich Daten liefern, werde es voraussichtlich rund ein Jahr nach dem Start von Europas Weltraumbahnhof im südamerikanischen Kourou dauern, betonten die Expertinnen und Experten. Die Kosten für alle insgesamt sechs geplanten Satelliten bezifferte die Direktorin des ESA-Erdbeobachtungsprogrammes, Simonetta Cheli, mit rund 2,8 Milliarden Euro. Mit MTG-S1 und Metop-SGA1 ist nun das erste von drei Tandems am Start, die beiden Folgegenerationen sollen dann rund 22 Jahre durchgehende Messungen ermöglichen. Der finanzielle Nutzen für Europa könnte sich laut EUMETSAT-Angaben über die gesamte Lebensdauer auf mehr als 63 Mrd. Euro belaufen.\nEuropas \"Fußballteam im All\"\nQuasi huckepack mit im Gepäck hat Metop-SGA1 auch einen Teil des \"Sentinel\"-Erdbeobachtungssystems - den \"Sentinel-5\". Das Modul wird detailliertere Informationen über die Atmosphären-Zusammensetzung liefern. Gemessen werden u.a. Konzentrationen von Methan, Kohlenmonoxid, Ozon, Stickstoffdioxid, Schwefeldioxid sowie winzige Schwebestoffe in der Luft - sogenannte Aerosole. Alle 100 Minuten tastet das System künftig die Erde von Pol zu Pol ab. Sentinel-5 ist dann die elfte Copernicus-Sonde im Orbit. Man habe nun \"ein ganzes Fußballteam\" im All, so Catharina Bamps von der EU-Kommission.\nAbseits des Sentinels versprechen die verbesserten weiteren Geräte an Bord noch genauere Temperatur- und Feuchtigkeitsmessungen der Luftschichten. Das erlaube neue Erkenntnisse über den Aufbau der Atmosphäre. So könne man komplexe Wetterprozesse besser verstehen und das \"Nowcasting\" - also die Vorhersage rund zwei bis sechs Stunden vor Stürmen oder Starkregen - genauer gestalten, erwartet Godela Rossner vom Deutschen Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR).\n(S E R V I C E - )\n(APA)",
