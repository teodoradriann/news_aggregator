    "title": "Snow warnings posted for New Year",
    "text": "State meteorologists were predicting heavy snow and an unusually cold start to the New Year, especially in Southern Norway. Warnings of as much as a half-meter of snow were posted along the southern coast, especially in Agder, from Sunday morning and into early next week.\n“It’s the area from Lindesnes (Norway’s southernmost point) and all the way up to Sandefjord and Vestfold that we’re warning about,” state meteorologist Martin Granerød told Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) on Friday. “We can expect between 20- and 50 centimeters of snow.”\nThat set off “orange-level” warnings for areas around Kristiansand and northwards, with “yellow” warnings in the mountains from Hovden and Geilo to Lillehammer. Residents of the Oslo area and most of the southeastern portion of the country (Østlandet) were told to brace for lots of winter weather as well.\nThe forecast included warnings of “challenging driving conditions” just as thousands of Norwegians will be returning from Christmas and New Year holidays. Lots of snow was expected especially on New Year’s Day on Monday.\nHeavy snow was also predicted in the mountains from Strynefjellet in the north to Hardangervidda and Haukelifjell farther south. Motorists were warned that roads can close or that driving in organized convoys may need to be set up. Western Norway was also hit by storms during the Christmas holidays that shut down some train lines and knocked out electricity for thousands of residents.\nGranerød linked the next batch of stormy weather to a low-pressure system coming in from the North Sea and over Skagerak, bringing with it cold and humid air over large parts of Southern Norway.\nThe snowy New Year’s weekend is expected to be followed by a cold snap heading in from the opposite direction, the far northeast, that can send thermometers plummeting from Northern- to Southern Norway. It’s linked to cold air from Siberia that’s predicted to send temperatures down to minus-30-40C in Finnmark and inland areas farther south, especially in Nordland.\nEven the Oslo area was bracing for temperatures down to minus-24C next week. “It hasn’t been that cold in Oslo in January since 1979,” climate researcher Elin Lundstad at the state Meteorologic Institute told news bureau NTB. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Oslo was minus-26C in 1942, also remembered as a long, dark winter during World War II.\nTemperatures along the southern coast may also fall to around minus-10C next week, leading to what Granerød called “a long cold period” extending well into January.\nNewsinEnglish.no/",

    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "Sharon Teresa Alloway-Bell, born on October 3, 1958, in Salina, Kansas, went home to be with the Lord on January 31, 2024, surrounded with the love of her children. Sharon is preceded in death by her mother Rita Aurora Zaragoza Alloway, father Nelson Wade Alloway, and her lifelong furry son, “London.” Left to carry on Sharon’s memory are her children: daughter, Teresa Ann Hughes and husband Maurice Hughes, and their four children: Omarie, Sanyiah, Zahcari, and Ezekiel Hughes; son, John Richard Bell and wife Linda Bell; siblings: Chris Alloway, Pamela Anderson (Tom), Mike Alloway (Anita), SunCha Gager, John Alloway, and Barbara Alloway; and a host of other relatives and friends. Born into a military family, Sharon embraced her upbringing with grace and resilience. Her father’s twenty years of service in the United States Army allowed them to travel and live across the country. Sharon leaves behind a legacy of love and faith. She was a devoted follower of God, a beacon of strength, and a woman of unwavering faith. Her belief in God’s love and guidance illuminated her path and inspired all who knew her, “HALLELUJAH!!” Sharon’s life was a vibrant tapestry woven with diverse passions and interests. She found joy in thrifting at antique stores frequently enough that she should have had her own antique store and indulging in movies where her compassion for them would guarantee tears before the movie was over. She was a master in the art of cooking and would feed anyone in the neighborhood, it didn’t matter who you were. During her children’s childhood, she was considered the neighborhood mom, passionately opening up her doors to any and every child who needed or wanted somewhere to go. She was a skillful storyteller whose stories would have you on the edge of your seat. With her captivating spooky stories, the best music playing, and all the food and snacks a kid could ask for, Ms. Sharon’s house was THE place to be. Sharon danced to the rhythm of life, leaving a positive impact on all those who came into contact with her. Her pursuits also included hunting, fishing, cross-stitching, and preserving her Native American heritage through artifact collection. Above all, Sharon cherished moments spent with her beloved ones, cultivating bonds that transcended time. For over twelve years, Sharon dedicated herself to Sam’s Club, where she flourished into a revered supervisor. Sam’s Club was not just a workplace; it was her second family, a place where lifelong bonds were established that still hold strong today. This is a testament to her warmth and dedication. Sharon’s presence illuminated every room she graced. Her infectious smile and laughter brightened even the darkest of days. She possessed an unmatched sense of humor and a fierce protectiveness for her loved ones. Crossing the line with any of her loved ones meant you would need the Army, Air Force, and Navy to stop her wrath. She simply loved and protected her family hard. In the hearts of those who knew her, Sharon’s memory will forever be a beacon of love, laughter, and unwavering faith. Though she may have departed this world, her spirit lives on in the cherished memories she leaves behind. A memorial service to celebrate Sharon’s life will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday, February 24, 2024, in Whiting’s Funeral Home.",

    "title": "Raymond Aron : quand le philosophe faisait déjà les frais de la \"cancel culture\"",
    "text": "Il ne fait pas bon être libéral en France. Il ne fait pas bon, non plus, l’avoir été. Outre la méfiance que suscite la pensée libérale auprès des tenants d’un Etat fort ou interventionniste, trois destins attendent aujourd’hui les grandes figures intellectuelles du libéralisme : l’oubli, la diabolisation ou ce qu’on pourrait appeler la consensualisation. Le fin penseur qu’était Raymond Aron se trouve dans ce dernier cas. Comme Benjamin Constant, comme Alexis de Tocqueville, Aron est certes souvent invoqué mais d’autant plus qu’il n’est plus guère lu. La gauche le tolère, le cite même, ce qui en dit long ; la droite lui rend vaguement hommage ; les journalistes et les étudiants le mentionnent. Cet Aron-là plaît à tout le monde parce qu’il n’est véritablement connu de personne.\nPublicité Cette ignorance relative, qui fait perdurer le mythe d’un personnage lisse et tiède, fait dans le même temps oublier que son souci permanent de justesse provoqua bien souvent l’ire de ses contemporains, y compris, on tend à l’oublier, à droite. En l’espèce, il fut plus qu’à son tour, dans un milieu et à une époque non exempts de grégarisme, solitaire. Ainsi, sa consécration méritée, en fin de carrière, ne doit pas masquer l’isolement qu’il a fréquemment subi - un fait malheureux que d’aucuns nomment volontiers aujourd’hui, comme s’il s’agissait d’un phénomène nouveau, la \"cancel culture\" .\nLIRE AUSSI : Le libéralisme de Raymond Aron n’était pas fait pour les âmes tendres, par Monique Canto-Sperber Raymond Aron obtient son doctorat en 1938. Sa thèse, qui sera publiée sous le titre Introduction à la philosophie de l’histoire , s’avère déjà en rupture avec le positivisme qui domine la philosophie française. Politiquement, il signale déjà son originalité. \"Une fois de plus, expliquera-t-il plus de quarante ans plus tard, comme d’habitude dans ma vie, j’étais dans un petit groupe, solitaire, entre les blocs, c’est-à-dire entre le bloc de ceux qui étaient déchaînés contre le Front populaire, et ceux qui croyaient que c’était une aube nouvelle de la société…\" Pour autant, il ne cautionne pas \"la politique antérieure ; je la trouvais parfaitement déraisonnable également, dans l’autre sens\". Sans compter qu’\"une bonne partie de la droite, celle des hebdomadaires Je suis partout , Candide , Gringoire , qui étaient horribles, une droite extrême, me rendait non seulement de gauche mais fou furieux\". Alors qu’il s’inquiète, à l’aube de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, de la mésentente croissante entre Français de gauche et de droite, il se retrouve entre les deux, \"sans grande chance de pouvoir m’exprimer et d’être écouté\" (1).\nLorsqu’il rejoint Charles de Gaulle à Londres, Aron fait preuve de la même distance critique, ce qui rend difficile son rattachement au mouvement gaulliste sans pourtant en faire l’un de ses opposants. \"Si être gaulliste c’était être le féal du général de Gaulle, ou croire en lui quelles que fussent ses opinions, alors, en effet, je ne l’étais pas\". Même face à la guerre, il se refuse à être \"dans l’extrême\", ce qui le condamne, constate-t-il, à l’écriture et à isolement (1).\nA la fin de la guerre, Aron s’oriente vers le journalisme plutôt qu’une carrière universitaire - décision qu’il regrettera plus tard - et finit par rejoindre Le Figaro comme éditorialiste. Il s’engage de surcroît, en 1947, au Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF), le tout nouveau parti gaulliste. Autant de choix qui dénotent une personnalité singulière, avide d’action autant que de pensée. Mais comme il ne s’engage pas à gauche comme il est d’usage, il en devient, selon les termes de son biographe Nicolas Baverez, un \"homme seul\" et un \"intouchable, banni par ses pairs\". \"La violente réaction de rejet dont il fut victime, ajoute Baverez, se traduisit par l’échec de sa candidature à une chaire de philosophie de la Sorbonne en 1948\". (2) Il y sera finalement élu en 1955, non sans obstacles. Commentant cette période, Aron usera de l’euphémisme : \"Je me sentais solitaire, dépouillé de mes amitiés de jeunesse. Bien entendu, je recevais aussi beaucoup de lettres de félicitations, mais j’y étais peu sensible parce qu’elles provenaient d’hommes qui m’étaient trop étrangers. Mais c’est vrai, je n’étais pas bien toléré par l’intelligentsia française dans cette période. […] J’étais un homme de droite, j’écrivais dans Le Figaro , etc.\" (1)\nLIRE AUSSI : Raymond Aron, le spectateur engagé de L’Express Aron fait d’autant plus grincer des dents parmi les intellectuels que la guerre froide bat son plein. Sa ferme défense de l’Alliance atlantique lui aliène un large spectre de politiques et d’intellectuels. En 1951, la sortie de ses Guerres en chaîne , où il montre qu’entre les deux grands vainqueurs de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, la paix est impossible mais la guerre improbable, provoque un véritable \"tir de barrage\". \"Aron, relate Baverez, dut alors affronter une sainte alliance des communistes, des progressistes et des neutralistes, qui marqua son complet isolement.\" Une fausse rumeur, propagée par le philosophe et neutraliste Etienne Gilson, le présente comme un agent payé par les Etats-Unis. Ostracisme et intolérance règnent tout autant à l’Institut d’études politiques où il enseigne de 1948 à 1954 et où ses idées sur le marxisme, la guerre froide et la IVè république \"heurtaient de front le catéchisme progressiste\" de la quasi-totalité des autres enseignants. Sa candidature implicite à un poste de professeur fut écartée avec élégance\" (2).\nDévasté par le décès brutal de l’une de ses filles en 1950, il devient, poursuit son biographe, \"un solitaire, rejeté par l’université et enfoui dans sa peine\" (2). Il publiera dans cette période l’un de ses chefs-d’œuvre, L’Opium des intellectuels , en 1955, où il soutient qu’il est impossible de constater l’existence du goulag sans devenir anticommuniste dans le même temps. Sa cible n’est pas tant les intellectuels communistes que \"mes amis qui reconnaissent l’existence des camps de concentration, qui ne sont pas communistes mais qui ne veulent pas être anticommunistes\", comme Sartre à cette époque. Il épingle ce \"mouvement intellectuel dont il n’y a guère eu l’équivalent ailleurs\" faits de \"ceux qui étaient entre les deux, qui étaient à tel point attirés par le prolétariat, le socialisme, l’histoire, la révolution, la gauche, qu’ils n’acceptaient pas les conséquences de la rupture avec le communisme\" et qui, partant, \"ne pouvaient admettre que la rupture avec l’Union soviétique conduisît nécessairement à mon chemin, c’est-à-dire à accepter l’Alliance atlantique et la coalition des anticommunistes\" (1).\nSon anti-communisme aurait pu en faire la coqueluche de la droite non-gaulliste. Il n’en est rien car Aron s’en prend à l’une de ses vaches sacrées, l’Algérie française. Convaincu dès l’après-guerre que \"la décolonisation, d’abord, était inévitable, ensuite qu’elle était conforme aux valeurs que les Occidentaux défendent\" (1), autrement dit, pour reprendre des termes aroniens, que l’existence de colonies n’est plus ni \"possible\" ni \"souhaitable\", il approfondit l’argument dans La Tragédie algérienne qu’il publie en 1957. L’ouvrage \"provoqua un réel séisme politique, relate Baverez. Aron s’aliéna la droite - prompte à s’élever contre la trahison de l’auteur de L’Opium […] -, mais aussi la gauche - qui dénonçait sous la plume de Jean Daniel \"le passage du conservatisme au défaitisme\" (2).\nA droite, les attaques sont rudes. Il se trouve alors en contradiction avec la ligne du journal dont il est éditorialiste. On l’accuse de faire le jeu du FLN, on s’étouffe lorsqu’il explique que \"la politique de la France ne pouvait pas être déterminée par un million de Français d’Algérie\", on prétend qu’il voudrait \"mettre les Français d’Algérie dans des camps de concentration\" (1). Jacques Soustelle, gouverneur général de l’Algérie au début de la guerre en 1955-1956 et fervent partisan de l’Algérie française, publie peu après La Tragédie algérienne une brochure au titre évocateur, Le Drame algérien et la décadence française, réponse à Raymond Aron . Ces échauffourées livresques masquent la popularité de la position aronienne. Pour une fois, Aron est l’homme de la majorité silencieuse puisqu’il exprime publiquement \"ce que la majorité des Français et la quasi-totalité de la classe politique pensaient sans oser se l’avouer\" (2). Il commentera modestement deux décennies plus tard : \"J’ai eu une influence très limitée, mais j’ai apporté, si je puis dire, aux hommes politiques modérés une représentation générale du monde qui justifiait leur politique\" (1).\nLIRE AUSSI : Dominique Schnapper : \"Macron ne peut plus agir, tout ce qu’il fait est considéré comme mal\" La reconnaissance universitaire tant attendue advient pendant la décennie 1960 puisqu’il devient directeur d’études à l’École pratique des hautes études. Point de retrouvailles, en revanche, avec la communauté intellectuelle en raison de ses prises de position, philosophique et politique, face à l’événement qui donnera un nouveau souffle à la gauche, mai 1968. Dans La Révolution introuvable , publiée la même année, il cherche à donner un sens sociologique à l’épisode, loin du mythe d’une jeunesse révolutionnaire salvatrice. Il prend position, par un certain nombre d’articles publiés en mai dans Le Figaro , contre \"le terrorisme du pouvoir étudiant\" qui souhaite s’immiscer dans la gouvernance de l’université. Ici, Aron, ne s’aliène pas seulement les usual suspects comme Sartre lequel, sous prétexte d’appeler Aron à pratiquer l’autocritique - un professeur doit savoir, selon la novlangue de l’époque, \"se contenter\" - frise l’insulte en proclamant qu’\"il faut […] que les étudiants puissent regarder Raymond Aron tout nu\" (2) ; des hommes plus modérés, tels Pierre Hassner et François Furet, prennent leurs distances face à un positionnement qu’ils jugent trop sévère (2).\nQuant aux gaullistes, il conservera avec eux une relation ambivalente. Bien que dans l’ensemble favorable à la politique étrangère gaullienne, il en critiquera de plus en plus le style, notamment la rhétorique anti-américaine, qu’il juge illusoire et dangereuse. De façon similaire, s’il est satisfait du retour du général de Gaulle en 1958, il n’oubliera pas de remarquer que celui-ci s’est trouvé \"à la limite du coup d’Etat\" quand il est revenu au pouvoir.\nDans les années 1970, Aron a réalisé la prédiction de Malraux qui avait auparavant annoncé à son ami : \"Attendez, attendez, quand vous aurez soixante-dix ans, ça s’arrangera, on vous reconnaîtra\" (2). Au soir de sa vie, il reconnaîtra que ses idées ont marqué maints universitaires et hommes politiques. Pour autant, non seulement il \"n’y a pas une secte aronienne\", jugera-t-il, mais il dira rester \"isolé et opposant, destin normal d’un authentique libéral\" (1).\nSelon les propres explications du philosophe, son isolement venait de son adoption d’\"un certain nombre d’attitudes\" (1). Ce dernier terme, polysémique, peut se référer au contenu même de ses positions, mais aussi, et c’est ce point que nous voudrions explorer, à la méthode aronienne menant à leur formulation.\nLIRE AUSSI : Sartre et Aron: inventaire Comme le titre du livre d’entretiens accordé par Aron à Jean-Louis Missika et Dominique Wolton en 1981 l’indique, Aron se voulait un \"spectateur engagé\". \"La volonté de voir, de saisir la vérité, la réalité, d’un côté, et de l’autre côté agir : ce sont, me semble-t-il, les deux impératifs auxquels j’ai essayé d’obéir toute ma vie\", développe-t-il (1). Cette formule, qui se distingue de l’engagement au sens sartrien, lie ensemble la pensée et l’action de telle sorte que, si l’on ne peut pas bien agir sans avoir pensé au préalable, on ne peut pas non plus bien penser si l’on n’a pas l’action en ligne de mire. La pensée, en d’autres termes, est bornée par ce qu’Aron nomme le réel ou la réalité. Le réel oblige, autrement dit, il impose une éthique intellectuelle qui se distingue du réflexe idéologique. Décrivant les \"intellectuels\", Aron remarque qu’ \"ils sont inquiets, angoissés par ce que notre régime existant comporte de mal (et tous les régimes comportent du mal), (qu’) ils sont assoiffés de la solution qui donnerait la société universalisable. Ils ont bien une opinion sur ce qu’il faut faire contre l’inflation ou au sujet du réarmement de l’Allemagne, mais c’est essentiellement des opinions à partir d’impératifs ou de postulats et non pas à partir d’une analyse de la conjoncture\". Or analyser la conjoncture, c’est vouloir produire un raisonnement adapté à chaque situation, c’est faire du sur-mesure, c’est être mesuré , non pas au sens de la tiédeur mais de l’exactitude. Ou encore, \"avoir des opinions politiques, ce n’est pas avoir une fois pour toutes une idéologie, c’est prendre des décisions justes dans des circonstances qui changent\" (1).\nCette éthique, dans le paysage politico-intellectuel de son époque, était rare. D’abord parce que nombre de politiques et intellectuels, à gauche mais aussi à droite, pétris d’idéologie, ne se préoccupaient que du \"souhaitable\" et non du \"possible\". Ensuite parce qu’en passant d’un camp à l’autre en fonction des changements de circonstances, Aron se démarquait de ses camarades qui privilégiaient la loyauté clanique. Avoir Aron de son côté pour un temps ne signifiait pas avoir gagné son soutien en toutes circonstances. \"Quand je vote, je vote pour Giscard d’Estaing et non pas pour Mitterrand, commentait-il. Donc si on définit la place d’un intellectuel par ses votes, je suis un intellectuel de droite, mais d’un caractère un peu particulier, c’est-à-dire indiscipliné et rarement d’accord avec celui pour lequel il a voté. Je critique avec la même liberté l’homme pour lequel j’ai voté que je le ferais si l’autre était élu.\" (1) Pour le dire autrement, il était libre.\nAu vu de la trajectoire d’Aron et de son influence intellectuelle posthume, nous savons aujourd’hui que son isolement n’a pas empêché sa réussite. Mieux, la plupart de ses positions, choquantes à l’époque pour certains, apparaissent rétrospectivement comme celles qu’il fallait adopter pour préserver la concorde nationale. Le temps a fait son œuvre et révélé, progressivement, la clairvoyance aronienne. Nous pouvons en tirer, pour le présent, une leçon. Tous les penseurs atypiques et isolés ne deviennent pas des Aron, mais en pensant atypiquement et en acceptant la solitude qui accompagne l’honnêteté intellectuelle, en refusant la logique clanique, on n’est pas seulement plus libre, on met toutes les chances de son côté pour, même beaucoup plus tard, avoir raison.\nGenerationLibre publie un recueil de contributions en hommage au grand philosophe libéral disparu il y a quarante ans, \"Raymond Aron, l’actualité de sa pensée 40 ans après sa mort\" .\n(1) Raymond Aron, Le Spectateur engagé.

    "title": "Valdo Calocane: Timeline of Nottingham triple killer's contact with mental health services | ITV News",
    "text": "Valdo Calocane had an extensive track record before he was charged with the killings of three people in Nottingham, as Social Affairs Correspondent Stacey Foster reports There was relief on the morning of June 13, 2023, when police announced they had arrested a suspect in connection with the brutal killings of three innocent people in Nottingham city centre. But what we did not know at the time was that Valdo Calocane was already a wanted man.In fact, had already been on the run for nine months after assaulting a female police officer in 2021.What is perhaps even more alarming is that mental health services in the city had also lost track of Calocane. The 33-year-old was a paranoid schizophrenic, known to mental health services since 2020. He had admitted to professionals that he was no longer taking his medication in 2021, was arrested on multiple occasions after acts of violence, and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act four times. He even visited MI5 in London to \"hand himself in\". Mental health professionals had not seen Calocane since March 2022, when he was reviewed at a discharge clinic.His extensive track record raises many questions for the authorities that exist to keep us all safe. How was such a dangerous person allowed to wander the streets of Nottingham undetected? Was information about this man being shared effectively? Before Calocane was due to be sentenced on January 25 for killing three people and injuring three others, Assistant Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire Police Rob Griffin gave an interview where he said: \"My honest assessment is no, I don't think we could have done anything that would have made any difference and would have prevented what happened on that day.\"Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories? Listen to our latest podcasts to find out What You Need To Know... Less than a week later, Mr Griffin admitted to ITV News that more should have been done, but that it was still his assessment that it would not have changed the outcome.He said: \"I have personally reviewed this matter and we should have done more to arrest him. \"However, because of the circumstance prevailing, at the time of the alleged assault, in my opinion it is highly unlikely that he would have received a custodial sentence. \"Of course, an arrest might have triggered a route back into mental health services, but as we have seen from his previous encounters with those services, it seems unlikely that he would have engaged in this process.\"Nottinghamshire Police has not referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on this failure at the time of writing. \"In relation to the brief pursuit before we detained Calocane we did make a referral to the IOPC,\" Assistant Chief Constable Griffin's statement added.\"I can confirm that in relation to the matter concerning the warrant, we followed the IOPC's guidance and, having shared details with them, we undertook professional discussions to establish whether the referral criteria was met. \"Following advice that the criteria was not met, we decided not to make a referral, but undertook an internal review of this matter.\"Calocane was born in Guinnea-Bissau. His family moved to Madeira when he was three-years-old and then to Lisbon, Portugal, when he was eight. He came to the UK in 2007 when he was 16-years-old.Valdo Calocane has been sentenced to a high-security hospital order. Credit: PA He had significant contact with mental health services in Nottingham before the killings on June 13, 2023. Here is a timeline:May 23, 2020 Calocane presented at A&E believing he was having a heart attack. He returned to his apartment 13 hours later and knocked a door down to gain entrance to another apartment in the block. He was arrested for causing criminal damage. An assessment under the Mental Health Act (MHA) concluded that he was psychotic, but that the risk to others was low, and that he should be referred, in the first instance, to the Crisis Team for review at home.He was released without charge. Upon returning to his apartment an hour later, he knocked down another door to a different apartment in the block. May 25, 2020 Calocane was detained under the MHA and admitted to Highbury Hospital after being arrested for criminal damage. He was treated with an anti-psychotic medication and discharged on June 17, 2020 to the care of the Nottingham City Crisis Team. He was advised to take the medication for a minimum of six to nine months, and to seek medical advice if he wished to stop taking it. July 14 and July 31, 2020 Calocane was re-admitted to Highbury Hospital after forcing his way into a flat having stopped taking his medication. This was the third apartment in the same block to which he attempted to gain forced entry. The anti-psychotic medication was restarted and increased. Thereafter, he was managed in the community by the Early Intervention in Psychosis team. His medication was increased twice. May, 2021 In May 2021, Calocane visited MI5 Headquarters in London to surrender to them because he believed they were controlling him.August 31 2021 Calocane admitted that he had stopped taking his psychotropic medication and had no intention of continuing with his treatment. He set out his view that he had never been mentally unwell, but that the voices he experienced were the creation of mental health services.September 3 2021 A section 135 MHA warrant was secured to gain entry to Calocane's property in order that an assessment could be conducted. The warrant was executed, on which occasion he assaulted a police officer. A bag of unused medication dating from February 2021 was discovered in the flat. He was admitted to inpatient services under Section 2 of the MHA and managed between September and October 2021. Thereafter, he had limited contact with his community team, appearing confrontational and missing appointments.January, 2022 Calocane was involved in an altercation with a flat-mate. An assessment under the MHA concluded that he could continue to be treated in the community, however he did not engage adequately with the Home Treatment Team.January 27, 2022 A further MHA assessment was conducted at his flat and he was admitted to hospital where he was treated for three weeks. He was discharged on February 24 2022 to the care of the City South team.March 14, 2022 Calocane was reviewed in an outpatient clinic, on which occasion he presented well. Thereafter, he attended the community service intermittently to collect his medication until early July 2022, but was noted to appear unkempt and to look suspicious. July, 2022 Calocane was prompted to collect his medication, but claimed (falsely, it appears) that he was not in the country. August, 2022 Calocane was not at home on a visit to his discharge address, and the resident stated that no-one of that name lived there. May 5, 2023 Calocane attacked two employees at a warehouse in Kegworth, where he had recently started working. Following that incident, efforts were made to contact him to tell him that he was not allowed back on the premises, but Calocane never answered. Now criminal proceedings have ended, NHS England can begin an Independent Mental Health Homicide Review. This is likely to take many months or even years to complete.A statement from Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust Chief Executive Ifti Majid said: \"Our thoughts are with the families and friends of Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates, and everyone affected by the tragic events in Nottingham in June 2023. \"As well as supporting Nottinghamshire Police with their investigations, in the event of a serious incident relating to a former patient, we robustly review our own interactions with that person to identify any learning. \"In this case, the patient was under our care between May 2020 and September 2022 with episodes of care both as an inpatient and in the community as an outpatient. \"It is important to remember that this person has been convicted of a crime of the most serious kind and there are many people who live with severe mental health issues who do not offend and are supported to live well in their community. \"We always aim to care for people in the least restrictive way and to support people to live well in their own homes and society. If a patient no longer engages with our services and support and they do not meet criteria to be detained under the Mental Health Act, they are discharged back to the care of their GP and can be referred back into our services at any time.\" This all bears a striking resemblance to a similar incident I reported on for ITV News in September 2020, just as we were coming out of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, and shops and bars were starting to reopen.Eight people were stabbed in Birmingham City Centre. I remember that Sunday morning walking around the city, counting the various different crime scenes scattered all over. A paranoid schizophrenic, Zephaniah McLeod, who had recently been released from prison, and was known to mental heath services, attacked people at random. Among them was a group of friends on a night out - for some of them it was their first visit to the city. Jacob Billington was killed and his best friend Michael Callaghan was left with life changing injuries. It's been two years since I last saw Michael, and while he has made significant steps in his recovery, he spoke to me about the challenges of hearing what happened in Nottingham.'He was already in prison. All they had to do to keep the public safe was nothing. It would have saved Jacob's life,' Michael Callaghan told ITV News Michael's Mum, Anne Callaghan, says risk assessments are still not working to keep the public safe.'If you could read some of the things I've read about the person who attacked Michael you'd just be absolutely astonished that he was allowed to be out and about,' Anne Callaghan told ITV News In the case of Zephaniah McLeod, a review took more than two years to be delivered to the families and even now they are still in search of answers as to what went wrong and what will change. A coroner's inquest into Mr Billington's death will start in February 2024, almost four years after he was killed.
