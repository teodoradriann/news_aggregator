We've attached links in our news story with more details. TOPICS:\nAlliant Energy Gas safety Homeowners Natural gas Gas leak Carbon monoxide Winter safety Digging incidents CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Wintertime is just around the corner here in eastern Iowa and as temperatures continue to cool off, that means more heat -- and natural gas -- for your home. That also means an increased risk of a gas leak.\nRight now, Alliant Energy is sharing safety tips with homeowners to help them stay safe during and from breaking the bank. There are several warning signs that could suggest a gas leak, including:\nThe smell of rotten eggs. A hissing or whistling noise near a gas appliance. Blowing dirt, bubbling water, or discolored vegetation in what is supposed to be a green area. Alliant Energy Communications Specialist II, Chris Caporale, said there are several things you can do to help prevent this from happening.\n\"There's a few things obviously, making sure your furnace is operating as efficiently as possible,\" Caporale said. \"Making sure the filters are changed and doing annual tune-ups or something like that, making sure all your windows are sealed preventing drafts, smart thermostats are another tool that are possible to help control the temperature in the home.\" There are several other steps you can take to help protect you and your home. You can find that list below:\nInstall carbon monoxide and natural gas detectors Detectors help identify odorless threats like carbon monoxide and are especially important for those with a known loss of smell. Additionally, certain soil conditions can strip the rotten egg odorant out of natural gas, making it more challenging to detect without proper equipment. If your natural gas detector goes off, move quickly to a safe location and call Alliant Energy at 1-800-255-4268 .\nPrevent snow and ice from blocking gas vents Once winter arrives, snow and ice can damage gas meters and pipes. Use a broom to keep gas service equipment clear. You must clear vents for gas appliances following a major snow or ice storm to enable proper venting and prevent carbon monoxide accumulation.\nDig safely In addition to increased potential gas and carbon monoxide risks when the weather turns cooler, there’s also an increased risk of gas pipeline damage as homeowners rush to finish yardwork. Digging incidents are the most common cause of underground natural gas leaks. If you plan to dig, including constructing a fire pit, visit call811.com at least three days ahead of time. This will initiate a free process for utilities to locate and mark underground lines so you can dig safely.\nEven minor damage to a gas pipeline such as nicks, scratches, cuts, scrapes, dents and gouges can result in pipeline failure or a major incident in the future if not properly assessed. Call Alliant Energy at 1-800-ALLIANT if your digging equipment or tools contact underground pipelines.\nFinally, never place a fire pit above a buried line. If the fire gets too hot, it could cause the gas pipeline below to leak or melt.\nYou can find the full list of gas safety tips by visiting the Alliant Energy homepage .\nStay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\n© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.

    "title": "Trabalhadores de fábricas da Boeing nos EUA entram em greve e interrompem produção do 737 MAX Por Reuters",
    "text": "Por Joe Brock e David Shepardson\nSEATTLE, Estados Unidos (Reuters) - Trabalhadores de fábricas da Boeing (NYSE: BA ) da Costa Oeste dos Estados Unidos entraram em greve nesta sexta-feira após rejeitarem por maioria esmagadora um acordo contratual, interrompendo a produção do jato mais vendido da fabricante de aviões, enquanto a empresa enfrenta sérios atrasos na produção e elevadas dívidas. A primeira greve dos trabalhadores desde 2008 acontece em um momento em que a companhia está sob forte escrutínio de reguladores e clientes dos EUA depois que um jato 737 MAX perdeu uma parte da fuselagem enquanto voava em janeiro. As crises crescentes atingiram as ações da Boeing e desencadearam uma reviravolta no comando. Desde o começo do ano, os papéis acumulam uma queda de 38%.\nO novo presidente-executivo da Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, foi contratado há apenas algumas semanas para restaurar a confiança na fabricante de aviões e propôs um acordo que incluía um aumento salarial de 25% ao longo de quatro anos, muito abaixo dos 40% exigidos pelos trabalhadores. Cerca de 30.000 membros da Associação Internacional de Maquinistas e Trabalhadores Aeroespaciais (IAM, na sigla em inglês), que produzem o 737 MAX da Boeing e outros jatos nas áreas de Seattle e Portland, votaram em seu primeiro contrato integral em 16 anos, com 94,6% rejeitando e 96% sendo a favor de uma greve. \"Isto é sobre respeito, sobre abordar o passado e sobre lutar pelo nosso futuro\", disse Jon Holden, que liderou as negociações do maior sindicato da Boeing, antes de anunciar o resultado da votação na noite de quinta-feira. Ele havia concordado com o acordo recém-derrotado. Uma greve prolongada poderia afetar gravemente as finanças da Boeing, que já estão sofrendo devido a uma dívida de 60 bilhões de dólares.\n \"Continuamos comprometidos em redefinir nosso relacionamento com nossos funcionários e o sindicato, e estamos prontos para voltar à mesa para chegar a um novo acordo\", disse a fabricante de aviões em um comunicado na quinta-feira. O acordo proposto incluía um bônus de assinatura de 3.000 dólares e uma promessa de construir o próximo jato comercial da Boeing na área de Seattle, desde que o programa fosse lançado dentro dos quatro anos do contrato. Embora a liderança do IAM tenha recomendado no último domingo que seus membros aceitassem o contrato, muitos trabalhadores responderam com raiva, argumentando a favor da demanda original e lamentando a perda de um bônus anual. \"Vamos voltar à mesa o mais rápido que pudermos\", disse Holden aos repórteres, sem dizer quanto tempo ele achava que a greve duraria ou quando as negociações seriam retomadas. \"Isso é algo que levamos um dia de cada vez, uma semana de cada vez.\" MÚLTIPLOS DESAFIOS\nTrabalhadores protestaram durante toda a semana nas fábricas da Boeing na área de Seattle que montam os jatos MAX, 777 e 767. Se prolongada, a greve também pesaria sobre as companhias aéreas que dependem dos jatos da fabricante de aviões e sobre os fornecedores que fabricam peças e componentes para suas aeronaves.\nO presidente-executivo da Air India, Campbell Wilson, disse nesta sexta-feira que as entregas do 737 MAX da Boeing para sua companhia aérea pareciam estar \"um pouco atrasadas\" mesmo antes do anúncio da greve, devido ao escrutínio regulatório após o incidente com um jato da Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK ) e problemas na cadeia de suprimentos que afetam o setor em geral.\nDe acordo com uma nota pré-votação da TD Cowen, uma greve de 50 dias poderia custar à Boeing entre 3 bilhões e 3,5 bilhões de dólares em fluxo de caixa.\nA última greve dos trabalhadores da Boeing em 2008 fechou fábricas por 52 dias e atingiu a receita em estimados 100 milhões de dólares por dia.\nA S&P Global Ratings disse que uma greve prolongada poderia atrasar a recuperação da fabricante de aviões e prejudicar sua recomendação geral. Tanto a S&P quanto a Moody's classificam a Boeing um nível acima do status \"junk\".\nA Casa Branca não respondeu imediatamente a um pedido de comentário.

    "text": "A Bittersweet Rediscovery of the Rarest Kangaroo Alive In the dense, emerald heart of the Wondiwoi Mountains, in [West Papua](https://palmoildetectives.com/tag/west-papua/) the trees echo with the haunting refrains of the vogelkop superb bird-of-paradise. Underfoot, the ground is soggy and dense with mossy herbaceous fragrances and the scuttling of an eastern long-beaked echidna as she burrows into her subterranean domain. In 2018, an extraordinary moment was captured forever on camera in 2018. High in the treetops, amidst the thick moss-covered branches, a shy Wondiwoi tree kangaroo lay in quiet repose, a symbol of sturdy, plump beauty. This creature was believed to be extinct for nearly a century. Yet a chance encounter by British amateur botanist Michael Smith in 2018 has thrust this creature back into the spotlight. Wondiwoi tree kangaroos Dendrolagus mayri have an odd combination of kangaroo and monkey qualities. Large and soulful eyes blink from behind long eyelashes and thickly furred paddle-like arms culminate in strong sharp claws fit for grasping tree branches. Their bodies are the colour of burnt umber and terracotta and embody the tranquillity of Papua’s majestic montane forests where they blend into the painter’s palette of the jungle. Smith’s serendipitous discovery of Wondiwoi tree kangaroos, known as the world’s rarest and most endangered kangaroo, highlights their precarious existence due to human-related threats like palm oil deforestation, rare mineral mining and hunting throughout their range. A Journey Fuelled by Passion and Curiosity Michael Smith is an amateur botanist from England. He spends a lot of his free time traversing remote locations like [Indonesia](https://palmoildetectives.com/tag/indonesia/), Pakistan and Kurdistan in the faint hope of encountering the rarest species on earth. “I want these animals to be the poster children for seriously threatened and ancient habitats. I’m trying to get evidence of something interesting – and in terms of getting people involved and excited about conservation, it seems to be effective.” He understands that time is of the essence to save these animals and many others from the relentless growth of palm oil deforestation. It’s hard to know if things will change fast enough for there to be anything left. In the 1990s, Papua New Guinea was just a big forest, with a few people. Now it’s still 80% or 90% forest, but there is huge pressure from people and investors who want to make palm oil.” Video Credit: [Palm Oil Detectives](https://youtu.be/1pzwtverGhU?si=d92OgCXSbUzrRsk1) The Enigmatic Wondiwoi Tree Kangaroo The bittersweet rediscovery of the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo underscores their gravely precarious position as the rarest kangaroo in the world. Originally they were discovered in 1928 by Ernst Mayer and known only by a single specimen. Papuan non-profit Tenkile Conservation Alliance estimates that less than 50 individuals remain alive. The Wondiwoi tree kangaroo’s habitat is under severe threat from [palm oil deforestation](https://palmoildetectives.com/category/news/the-problems-with-palm-oil/palm-oil-deforestation-fires-ecocide/) and the extraction of rare minerals such as mica and [gold](https://palmoildetectives.com/tag/boycott-gold/). The forests of West Papua, once a haven for diverse wildlife, are being decimated in silence. The Guardians of the Forest The survival of the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo is intricately linked to the sovereignty, and land stewardship of the [Papuan indigenous peoples](https://palmoildetectives.com/2022/08/09/anthropologist-and-author-of-in-the-shadow-of-the-palms-dr-sophie-chao-in-her-own-words/). Their deep spiritual and ancestral connection to the land and its human and more-than-human inhabitants stands in stark contrast to the destructive policies of the colonialist Indonesian government. Conservation efforts must prioritise indigenous rights and knowledge, recognising that true protection of these animals lies in the hands of those who have lived in harmony with the forest for many millennia. [Tenkile Conservation Alliance](https://tenkile.com/saving-tree-kangaroos/) have a range of programmes helping indigenous peoples to understand the importance of conserving rather than hunting tree kangaroos and providing them with ways to harvest alternative sources of food. They have developed tree kangaroo hunting moratoriums as well alongside village communities. The Jungle Kingdom of Dendrolagus: Tree Kangaroos The [genus Dendrolagus](https://palmoildetectives.com/?s=dendrolagus), more enchantingly known as tree kangaroos, embody arboreal grace and irresistible chubby cuteness. These [marsupials](https://palmoildetectives.com/tag/marsupial/) are lesser known than their iconic ground-dwelling cousins further south in Australia and possess a range of distinctive traits making them masters of the jungle canopy. Their exceptionally long, pendulous tails act as elegant counterbalances, helping with every leap and bound. Strong forelimbs, paired with shorter and broader hind feet, provide them with superior strength and agility. Long curved claws and spongy paws enhance grip, like natural bouldering shoes, allowing them to climb and cling effortlessly to branches. Females possess a forward-opening pouch (marsupium) containing four teats. These provide a nurturing haven for their developing young. Their teeth are adapted for shearing leaves, reveal their dietary preference for the verdant foliage of the treetops.

    "text": "La IA podría \"volverse contra los humanos\", según célebre informático\nespeciales\nEl célebre informático Yoshua Bengio, pionero de la inteligencia artificial (IA), considera que esos sistemas podrían llegar a \"volverse contra los humanos\", según lo declaró durante una entrevista concedida este jueves a CNBC en el marco de la cumbre One Young World, celebrada en Montreal (Canadá).\n\"Es realmente importante proyectarnos hacia un futuro en el que tengamos máquinas tan inteligentes como nosotros, en muchos aspectos, y lo que eso significaría para la sociedad\", explicó. \"La inteligencia da poder. Entonces, ¿quién va a controlar ese poder? Tener sistemas que saben más que la mayoría de la gente puede ser peligroso en las manos equivocadas y crear más inestabilidad a nivel geopolítico\", añadió.\nAsimismo, señaló que si esto ocurriera en cinco años, no estaremos preparados, argumentando que carecemos de métodos para asegurarnos de que estos sistemas no perjudiquen a las personas o no se vuelvan contra ellas. \"No sabemos cómo hacerlo\", admitió Bengio.\n\"Si creamos entidades que son más inteligentes que nosotros y tienen sus propios objetivos, ¿qué significa eso para la humanidad? ¿Estamos en peligro?\", continuó. \"Todas estas son preguntas muy difíciles e importantes, y no tenemos todas las respuestas. Necesitamos mucha más investigación y precaución para mitigar los potenciales riesgos\", concluyó.",

    "title": "Heavy Rainfall in Tamil Nadu Causes Widespread Waterlogging; IMD Predicts More Showers",
    "text": "Heavy rainfall swept through parts of Tamil Nadu, including the Thoothukudi district, on Friday, leading to significant waterlogging and disrupting daily commutes. While light showers graced other state regions the previous day, the sudden downpour was primarily attributed to a dip in the mid-upper level trough, ushering in isolated thunderstorms over Thoothukudi. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted light to moderate rainfall accompanied by isolated thunderstorms and lightning across Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and parts of Kerala for the day.\nAdvertisment Immediate Impact on Daily Life The unanticipated heavy showers have caused considerable inconvenience to residents and commuters in the affected areas. Several roads and low-lying areas in Thoothukudi were submerged under water, causing traffic disruptions and delaying daily activities. Local authorities are on high alert, deploying teams to manage the waterlogging and ensure safety. Public advisories have been issued, urging citizens to exercise caution and avoid unnecessary travel.\nWeather Forecast and Precautions Advertisment According to the IMD, this spell of rain is part of a larger weather pattern affecting the region. Apart from Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Kerala, hot and humid conditions are forecasted for Rayalaseema and Kerala over the next five days. Northern parts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are also expected to experience similar weather conditions in the next two days. Residents and travelers in these areas are advised to stay informed about the weather conditions and take necessary precautions.\nLooking Ahead The recent rainfall and the IMD's predictions indicate a crucial period for the region's weather patterns. While the rain brings temporary relief from the preceding hot weather, it also poses challenges in terms of waterlogging and the potential for subsequent disruptions. Authorities and citizens alike are bracing for the forecasted conditions, hoping to mitigate the adverse effects of the weather on their daily lives and livelihoods. As the situation develops, the focus remains on preparedness and timely response to ensure minimal impact on the community.",
