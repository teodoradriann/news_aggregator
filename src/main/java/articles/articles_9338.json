    "title": "A Toddler Just Found An Ancient Canaanite Amulet In Israel",
    "text": "Ziv Nitzan found an ancient Canaanite scarab amulet at Tel Azekah, the site where the Bible says David defeated Goliath. Emil Aladjem/Israel Antiquities Authority Three-year-old Ziv Nitzan found an ancient Canaanite amulet while hiking in Israel with her family.\nDuring a family trip to Tel Azekah in Israel, a three-year-old girl came across a 3,800-year-old Canaanite amulet. The archaeological site is mentioned in the Bible as the location of the battle between David and the Philistine giant Goliath.\nThe stone artifact depicts scarabs, beetles sacred to ancient Egyptians, adding to the long list of evidence that attests to the close cultural ties between Canaan and Egypt during the Bronze Age.\nA Toddler Finds An Ancient Amulet Lying On The Ground Emil Aladjem/Israel Antiquities Authority The Canaanite artifact depicts scarabs, which were commonly used on seals and amulets in ancient times.\nZiv Nitzan of Moshav Ramot Meir, Israel, was on a hike with her parents and two older sisters at the foot of the hill where Tel Azekah stands when she found what seemed to be an odd-shaped stone. When her family got a closer look, however, they realized it was no stone at all.\n“We were walking along the path, and then Ziv bent down — and out of all the stones around her, she picked up this particular stone,” her sister Omer said, according to a Facebook post by the Israel Antiquities Authority . “When she rubbed it and removed the sand from it, we saw something was different about it. I called my parents to come see the beautiful stone, and we realized we had discovered an archaeological find! We immediately reported this to the Israel Antiquities Authority.”\nEmil Aladjem/Israel Antiquities Authority The other side of the amulet.\nZiv was awarded a certificate of appreciation for good citizenship after her family reported the discovery. The scarab amulet was then handed over to the IAA and will soon be included in a special display for Passover at the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, alongside other finds from ancient Egypt and Canaan.\nMeanwhile, experts examined the scarab amulet that Ziv found and have released more information about the artifact’s history.\nExperts Identify The Amulet As A 3,800-Year-Old Canaanite Artifact Dr. Daphna Ben-Tor, an expert in ancient amulets and seals, examined the artifact and determined it to be a Canaanite scarab from the Middle Bronze Age.\n“Scarabs were used in this period as seals and amulets,” she said, per the IAA announcement. “They were found in graves, in public buildings, and in private homes. Sometimes they bear symbols and messages that reflect religious beliefs or status.”\nEmil Aladjem/Israel Antiquities Authority Three-year-old Ziv holds her discovery.\nScarab seals originated in ancient Egypt. They were designed in the shape of dung beetles, which were considered sacred to the culture. The creatures were seen as symbols of new life because of the dung balls they created and laid their eggs in, thus giving way to children or “new life.”\nThe Egyptian name for the beetle, hprr , also means “rising from, come into being itself.” Scarabs were seen as a symbol of the incarnation of God the Creator, and the amulet’s proximity to a Biblical site only makes the discovery that much more fascinating.\nTel Azekah, The Location Where David Fought Goliath In the Book of Samuel (Samuel 1 17:1), Tel Azekah is explicitly named as the location of the battle between David and the giant Goliath. Today, it is a highly important archaeological site that has been undergoing excavations for over a decade.\n“We have been excavating here for almost 15 years, and the excavation findings show that during the Middle Bronze and Late Bronze Ages, here in Tel Azekah, thrived one of the most important cities in the Judean Lowlands,” said Professor Oded Lipschits, director of the Tel Aviv University archaeological dig. Lipschits also traveled out to meet Ziv and her family after the discovery.\nEmil Aladjem/Israel Antiquities Authority An aerial view of the Tel Azekah archaeological site.\n“The scarab found by Ziv joins a long list of Egyptian and Canaanite finds discovered here, which attest to the close ties and cultural influences between Canaan and Egypt during that period,” he added.\nIAA director Eli Escusido also offered praise to Ziv and her family for the discovery. “Thanks to her, everyone will be able to see it and enjoy it,” he said.\nIsraeli Minister of Heritage Amichai Eliyahu echoed this sentiment, stating, “The seal that little Ziv found during a family trip to Tel Azekah connects us to a grand story, that of the ancient civilizations that lived in this land thousands of years ago. The scarab Ziv found also reminds us that in the Land of Israel, even children can be a part of discovering history.”",

    "title": "Racial and ethnic trends in mental health service utilisation and perceived unmet need in the USA",
    "text": "Two decades ago, the Surgeon General issued a report highlighting concerning disparities in mental healthcare among racial and ethnic minority populations. The present study characterised national trends in mental health treatment utilisation by race and ethnicity across a 13-year period.\nNationally representative data were drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2008 through 2020 (unweighted n=4 41 993). Trends in mental health treatment utilisation and perceived unmet treatment need among individuals with and without psychiatric illness were stratified by race and ethnicity.\nLogistic regression analyses revealed most racial/ethnic minority groups were less likely to receive treatment than white individuals, regardless of mental health status. Treatment utilisation increased among those with (annual per cent change (APC)=0.83, 95% CI=0.41 to 1.26) and without psychiatric illness (APC=1.39, 95% CI=0.53 to 2.26). Among individuals with psychiatric illness, treatment use increased among white (APC=0.88, 95% CI=0.51 to 1.24), Hispanic (APC=2.12, 95% CI=0.70 to 3.57) and black adults (APC=1.07, 95% CI=0.11 to 2.04). White (APC=1.88, 95% CI=0.86 to 2.91) and Hispanic (APC=2.45, 95% CI=0.02 to 4.93) individuals without psychiatric illness also saw increased treatment use. Although increases in perceived unmet treatment need were observed for all racial and ethnic groups except blacks and Native Americans with psychiatric illness, rates remained low across all groups.\nAlthough national rates of mental health treatment utilisation have risen, this was almost entirely observed among white and Hispanic individuals with and without psychiatric illness, highlighting the limited progress made towards eliminating disparities in care.",

    "text": "Tendai Rupapa Senior Reporter\nHEALTH Ambassador First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa yesterday ushered in a new era in breast cancer screening when she took her recently acquired ultra-modern and top-notch mobile hospital to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals for free services to patients.\nAmai Mnangagwa recently received the mobile hospital as a gift from President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus in recognition of her philanthropic work and efforts to transform the lives of vulnerable members of the community.\nThe First Lady further facilitated the training of a group of radiologists, radiographers and technicians by experts from Belarus on the use of the advanced mammography equipment in the mobile hospital as well as its maintenance.\nMidwives also received training in Belarus to handle cases where women give birth during screening.\nThose who got training in Belarus, imparted the knowledge they got to their local counterparts.\nUsing the advanced machinery, breast cancer will be detected at an early stage, greatly reducing the risk of breast cancer mortality.\nThe mobile hospital also consists of an ultrasound scan, gynaecological machinery and a radiation machine.\nThe mother of the nation, who has a passion for the welfare of women among many other disadvantaged groups, yesterday visited the hospital where she interacted with the patients at the mobile hospital encouraging them to grab the opportunity to be screened for breast cancer so that it is detected early and treated to save lives.\nCancer screening, Dr Mnangagwa explained, is neither frightening nor painful.\nShe added that even men will have the same services as they are also affected by breast cancer.\nAngel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa and Dr George Jakanani listen as Sr Linda Karera explains how they book patients for cancer screening into the ultra-modern top-notch mobile hospital at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals yesterday\nThe First Lady explained that the services were not meant for cities and towns alone as they will be rolled out to rural areas, including those that are hard to reach.\nGogo Agfa Mashoko (70), who was among beneficiaries of the programme, was at a loss for words because of the love Dr Mnangagwa had shown.\n“Our mother we want to thank you for the love that you show us always. It is not this screening alone, there is a lot that you do for us around the country.\n“Today we want to thank you for the mobile hospital that you have brought for us so that we are examined. A lot of women are dying in the communities because of lack of money and knowledge, but look at what you have done Mhamha. Mwari varambe vachikukomborerai, rudo rwenyu rwakatikoshera,” she said with a broad smile.\nThe First Lady sought to know what it is that motivated Gogo Mashoko to be screened for cancer even at an advanced age.\n“What is it that made you come to be screened at your age?” she asked.\nIn response, Gogo Mashoko curtly replied: “Cancer knows no age, it affects people of all ages, all of us are affected. Be it the cervix or breast cancer, we are affected, but because of what you have done we will all be screened. Thank you.”\nAngel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa teaches women awaiting breast cancer screening from her ultra-modern top notch mobile hospital, the importance and benefits of being screened for cancer at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals yesterday\nDr Mnangagwa thanked the women for putting their health first and encouraged them to advise their relatives and friends to be screened.\n“I want to thank you all for coming vanamai. Why do I thank you? You have put health first. Good health is what defines an individual. We do not want you to wake up saying I do not understand how I am feeling.\n“I have taken pain killers and tomorrow you say it’s much better. What is it that is causing you pain and are you aware of it? Your coming here is very good because as women if you take the lead in terms of health our families will follow.\nUnderstand that families follow mothers. If you take the lead, our children will follow in their totality. Men are not spared when it comes to breast cancer. This mobile hospital will assist our girls, boys, men and women.\n“Together with the team of doctors and our mobile hospital we shall visit rural areas as this programme is not confined to the capital city and towns.\n“We shall visit rural areas where we shall stay as I go door-to-door encouraging women to come forward and be screened. What happens inside the mobile hospital is that when one comes out, she will be having his/her results and will go back home knowing her status.\n“All of you will go home knowing whether or not you will have tested positive or negative for breast cancer. Once you test positive, they immediately know what to do so that you are treated early.\n“The screening is neither fierce nor painful. That idea of coming forward to be tested please keep it up. When you go back tell others and it’s a one-stop facility. The hospital has come to you,” the First Lady said, whereupon the women ululated and clapped their hands.\nHealth Ambassador First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa shares a lighter moment while demonstrating how women should get into the ultra-modern top notch mobile hospital for breast cancer screening at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals yesterday\nDr George Jakanani, a specialist and consultant radiologist from Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals praised the First Lady for her service to the nation.\n“We have been trialling out the new mobile digital mammography hospital which came from our First Lady through her Angel of Hope foundation. The hospital is offering services that were previously not available for the vast majority of our population.\n“Crucially we have been able to start a screening programme for breast cancer. Patients are coming and having mammogram done here at Parirenyatwa at no cost to them.\n“This is a state-of-the-art equipment that also allows us to go out into the community since this is a mobile hospital which means the hospital can come to the patient and it will remove a lot of the logistical challenges that our patients often face.\n“You can imagine someone out in Gokwe, Murambinda or Mt Darwin. We can now physically take state-of-the-art technology to the patent’s doorstep.\n“A lot of patients when they hear about cancer of the breast, their first sort of reaction or thought is that of death, but what we are saying is if we screen you early enough that is if we pick up this cancer before it is clinically apparent then you have a much better chance of survival because treatment can be instituted early and curative surgery or treatment can be done.\n“We are very excited that this service has now commenced at Parirenyatwa and hopefully we can streamline the service, improve it as we go along so that more and more people can actually benefit from it.\n“We want to thank the First Lady for organising this and extending its use to various districts and provinces of our country and this will be of benefit to our patients,” he said.\nAngel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa talks to a cancer patient (far left) as she was about to be screened for breast cancer in the digital mammography unit in the ultra-modern mobile hospital, while radiographer Ms Farai Maguduru (second from left) and Dr George Jakanani look on at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals yesterday\nSimilar sentiments were echoed by Matron Miriam Zembera.\n“I am grateful for the programme that was set in motion by our First Lady of doing mammogram. Breast cancer mostly kills women but when detected early one can be cured and heal.\n“I have testimonies of a lot of people who were cured and healed because it was detected early. So this is a good development that we are happy for. We thank our mother for what she is doing in our country,” the matron said.\nMs Farai Maguduru, a radiographer, gave a brief on what happens in the mobile hospital.\n“When a patient enters the hospital, they get to the changing area where they undress and put on a gown so that we take an X-ray. We take two projections of the breasts one while standing properly and the other on the side. Our machine will assist us as it can move in all angles. Once we have taken these angles, our examination will be complete,” she said.\nGogo Catherine Chatsakama (52) of Mudzi, who was transferred from All Souls Mission Hospital in Mutoko, was among those who were attended to yesterday.\n“I was referred here from All Souls Mission with a challenge with my breast. The doctors told me that I came at the right time. Today I was checked and I now know where I stand so I encourage other women to come forward and be screened for breast cancer.\n“I thank our mother the First Lady for rolling out this programme so that we do not suffer from home,” Gogo Chatsakama said happily.\nGogo Egfa Mashoko, who could not contain her excitement of being screened for breast cancer for free, hugs First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa and thanks her for championing and prioritising the health of citizens during an Angel of Hope Foundation cancer screening programme in the ultra-modern top-notch mobile hospital at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals yesterday. – Pictures: John Manzongo",

    "text": "近日，有关部门针对加强智能网联新能源汽车产品召回、生产一致性监督管理与规范宣传发布通知，向社会公开征求意见。其中提到，企业应当在车辆App、车载信息交互系统显著位置和用户手册中显示组合驾驶辅助系统的安全提示和使用说明，避免驾驶员将组合驾驶辅助功能视为自动驾驶功能使用。\n无论在专业定义上，还是在公众朴素观念中，所谓“自动”是不借助人力就可直接运行的能力。近些年，汽车智能化成为各大车企争相发力的方向，相关技术也取得了不小进步。但依据标准，目前我国的量产乘用车智能驾驶功能都在L2及以下，系统可实现车道保持、自适应巡航等功能，但必须以驾驶员操作为主。反观某些车企，为了流量、销量暗拗“自动”造型，宣扬“脱手脱眼”，自诩“L2+”“L2.9”。部分车主也对这类夸大营销深信不疑，甚至有人在高速路上睡大觉，由此造成了一些惨痛事故。\n 安全可靠是我们对汽车的基本要求，智能化当然值得鼓励，但必然不能脱离安全这一根本。 去年，工信部就明确提出禁止使用“自动驾驶”“高阶智驾”等模糊词汇，统一推广“组合辅助驾驶”等术语；今年4月，相关会议再次强调，汽车生产企业需明确系统功能边界和安全响应措施，禁止夸大和虚假宣传。此番相关部门在“提示说明”上细化规定，其实是对标准的进一步升级：不仅不能玩文字游戏搞“暗示”，更得主动确保消费者的知情权。 希望所有企业能将系统能力、系统边界等信息摆在明面，共同匡正驾驶员们对于辅助驾驶的认知，真正把安全的方向盘牢牢掌握在自己手里。\n以更大视野看，行业健康发展需要将功夫用在研发上，而不是一味在噱头上“卷活”。 近年来，中国新能源汽车产业不断提升核心竞争力，年产销规模均超过1200万辆。市场蓬勃发展，竞争愈发激烈，各家都想在功能突破上领先一步。但必须看到，任何新技术的发展运用都需要一定过程。坚守长期主义发展理念，通过真正的技术创新、管理创新给广大消费者带来优质产品和服务，才能一直被看见、被信任。\n仰望星空更要脚踏实地。期待明确规则后，相关企业都能稳扎稳打、厚积薄发，让新能源汽车为中国智造打开更广阔发展空间。\n图源：视觉中国\n更多热点速报、权威资讯、深度分析尽在北京日报App\n来源：北京日报客户端\n流程编辑：u028\n如遇作品内容、版权等问题，请在相关文章刊发之日起30日内与本网联系。版权侵权联系电话：010-85202353",
