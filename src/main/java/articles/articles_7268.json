According to reports, he remarked that the two teen girls, 14 and 16, were allowed to sit there, ultimately pulling out a knife and stabbing them — one in the thigh and the other in the back, the latter of whom was treated for a collapsed lung at Bellevue Hospital.\nThe man allegedly shouted racist remarks as well. Law enforcement sources told the New York Post at the time that the man yelled, “I want all the white people dead,” and “I want to sit next to the crackers.”\nThis is far from the man’s first infraction. According to the Post, he has been arrested “17 times over the last two decades — and the subject of more than a half dozen domestic violence complaints by a Manhattan woman he has allegedly stalked for over a year, according to sources.”\nFurther, he was recently put back on the streets by Judge Matthew Grieco, whom Mayor Eric Adams (D) appointed, with a conditional discharge after threatening a stranger. According to reports, he shouted at the victim, “Why are you working for white people? I’m going to kill this man.”\nHe then allegedly threatened to shoot the victim, adding, “I don’t care what kind of green card the government gave you. Open your mouth and say something. I will shoot you right now.”\nThat hearing for that incident was on December 12, mere weeks before he allegedly stabbed the two teenagers.\n“If the judge had only held this individual accountable, two innocent tourists, children, may have had a Merry Christmas instead of an ‘attempted murderous’ Christmas,” a law enforcement source told the Post\n, which detailed more of Hutcherson’s history of violence and mental health episodes:\n[\nlink to www.breitbart.com (secure)\n]\ntry and focus on the legal aspect not the race on this one\nCoastie Patriot\nSIC SEMPER TYRRANIS\nTHE SAME PEOPLE WHO SAID NO GUNS BECAUSE OF POLICE NOW WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE!!!!\nDr Thaddeus They\nThey don't really care whether the truth gets out, because the public no longer knows what's meant by \"the truth.\"\nWell, I mean, no one can tell the difference anymore between what's real and what's fake.\nAnyway, the point is, I can tell you all of this, right out in the open, because it doesn't matter who knows about it.

    "text": "James Rolin reports on the progress of the newest NeighborWorks owner-built homes, with 10 families ready to move in to their new houses next week after spending the last 16 months building the houses from the ground up. From the NeighboWorks website: NeighborWorks' Owner Built Homes allow participants to earn substantial equity by working with a group of other families to help build each others' homes, and in doing so help to build one another's dreams. Their labor is called “sweat equity” and is what makes these homes affordable. Hard work is the key to this project, along with a desire to work together to build our community and new homes. The group commits to building 10 homes together, and no one can move in until all 10 homes have been completed. NeighborWorks Owner Built Homes allow families and individuals to embark on a guided development that turns their homeownership dream into a reality. This program is apart of the National \"Mutual Self-Help Housing\" model designed to provide affordable, clean and safe homes to families in rural areas. For more information about the program, call NeighborWorks at 406-761-5861, or click here to visit the website.",

    "text": "Looking to build on their opening-game victory over [Ghana](/team/ghana/nNBjHale/), [Cape Verde](/team/cape-verde/MocyWdm7/) started brightly and [Mozambique](/team/mozambique/2aBNiivt/) goalkeeper Ernani was forced to make an early diving save to deny Deroy Duarte’s well-struck effort across goal. [Bebe](/player/bebe/SMffmeAM/) was next to threaten as he left the bar shaking from a free kick from distance, but he would go one better just after the half-hour mark. With the ball sitting at least 45 yards from goal, it appeared Mozambique and more specifically Ernani, was expecting a cross. Bebe’s fiercely hit effort was full of dip and swerve but was still straight at the goalkeeper who should have done better as he parried the ball into the net to make it 1-0. Despite offering limited attacking threat, Os Mambas thought they had a chance to equalise from the spot just before the break when a tangle of legs saw Geny Catamo go down in the area, but the decision was overturned following a VAR intervention. Any hopes of a comeback were quickly quashed after the break when Edmilson Dove was robbed of the ball on the edge of his own area by [Ryan Mendes](/player/mendes-ryan/0MexVJ9m/) who kept his cool to beat Ernani and make it 2-0. Geny Catamo almost managed to strike back with a free kick just before the hour mark, but it clipped the top of the bar and went behind. Cape Verde would put the game beyond doubt with just over 20 minutes to go as Ryan Mendes bagged his second. From a mere 30 yards out, his piledriver was closer to goal than Bebe’s opener, but this time Ernani had no chance as it flew straight into the top corner to give Tubaroes Azuis an unassailable lead. The victory means that Cape Verde have already won the group after winning both of their games, but despite sitting bottom of the group, a victory in their final game could still be enough for Mozambique to advance. However, they’ll need today’s opponents to avoid defeat against [Egypt](/team/egypt/bejDn7NN/) to make that happen. Flashscore Man of the Match: Ryan Mendes da Graca (Cape Verde)",

After it didn't work, the suspect got inside the victim's car but was unable to drive away because the victim had the keys in his pocket, according to investigators. \"His face was all red and he was crying,\" the man told KOMO News. \"His girlfriend asked me what I sprayed with and I sprayed her in the face, too.\" The two suspects, believed to be a man and a woman in their 30s, were arrested as Federal Way police arrived at the scene, KOMO News reported. The suspects face charges of eluding police, carjacking, and hit and run, according Johnson. Moments before the suspects were arrested According to the investigators, two suspects were eluding Kent police in a stolen vehicle driving northbound on Interstate 5. After a short time chasing after the stolen car, Kent police stopped their pursuit due to strict laws in Washington about officers in high-speed chases. Kent police officers reported the suspects hit multiple cars as they were escaping. The suspects lost control of their vehicle and stopped at a rest area off I-5 in Federal Way, nearly 8 miles north of their first encounter with Kent police. The suspects tried to break into three cars while at the rest stop, state investigators said. One of the suspects opened 72-year-old woman's car door, leading to the bear spray encounter. Investigators said none of the victims suffered serious injuries as the suspects tried stealing the cars. \"I never thought something like this would happen to me, you see stuff all the time,\" the woman's son told KOMO News, \"He's lucky I had bear spray otherwise I would have knocked him to the ground.\"",

    "text": "記者張沛嘉／綜合報導\n▲富邦悍將林岳谷。（圖／富邦悍將提供）\n富邦悍將17日以3：6敗給統一獅，其中二壘手林岳谷單局2次失誤是關鍵敗因，賽後他在社群在球迷道歉，也懇請網友針對自己就好「不要辱罵我的另一半」。\n悍將在熟悉的新莊擔任客場，前6局打完3：2領先，7局下1出局邱智呈擊出二壘方向滾地球，林岳谷沒有算好彈跳，讓邱智呈安全上壘，隨後獅隊敲出適時安打，邱智呈跑回追平分，1出局滿壘時，潘傑楷擊出二壘方向滾地球，林岳谷已經趨球傳往本壘封殺，結果傳偏讓錯失雙殺機會，還讓統一獅5：3取得超前。\n最終統一獅靠著林岳谷2次關鍵失誤拿下勝利，賽後林岳谷在社群發文「對不起今天讓大家失望了」，隨後又在留言區呼籲，「抱歉我的表現讓你們失望，但你們可以針對我罵就好了，請不要用不當的言詞辱罵我的另一半，她並沒有做錯事。謝謝」。\n▲林岳谷單局2次關鍵失誤。（影片來源：CPBLYT，若遭移除請見諒。）\n 在 Threads 查看 更多新聞： 自培出頭1／和慈妹同框是重要轉折點　劉俊豪經歷高潮、低谷保持正向\n更多新聞： 中職／感謝平野惠一督促　黃韋盛看網友評價自省「他們都知道...」",
