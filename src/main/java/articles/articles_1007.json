    "text": "Former president Donald Trump appeared to slur his words while speaking on his campaign objective to mandate the death penalty for drug dealers. President Joe Biden’s 2024 campaign rolled out a series of videos featuring gaffes and nonsensical phrases from his Republican rival, adding fuel to the fire over concerns about the former president’s cognitive ability. One clip started mid-sentence, showing Mr Trump speaking in New Hampshire on Monday (22 January): “Which is incapable of solvin’ even the sollest… smallest problem. The simplest of problems we can no longer solve. “We are an institute in a powerful death penalty. We will put this on,” the 77-year-old Mr Trump blundered.

Loper Jr. Memorial Scholarship. NDB funds, in part, Dairy Management Inc., which manages the national dairy checkoff program.\nUndergraduate students in their sophomore through senior year for the 2024-25 academic school year and enrolled in college or university programs emphasizing dairy are eligible. Relevant majors may include communications/public relations, journalism, marketing, business, economics, nutrition, food science, and agriculture education.\nScholarships are awarded based on academic achievement, an interest in a career in a dairy-related discipline, and demonstrated leadership, initiative, and integrity. Candidates must complete an application form, submit an official transcript of all college courses, and write a short statement describing their career aspirations, dairy-related activities, and work experiences.\nThe application information is evaluated by an NDPRB Scholarship Committee composed of an external review panel and at least two Board members. The committee’s recommendations are summarized by NDPRB staff, and the scholarships are then awarded.\nStudents may be awarded scholarships in multiple years. Scholarship winners must be enrolled during the entire academic year for which the scholarship is awarded.\nApplications can be\nfound here. Completed applications must be received no later than May 31, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. CST.\nThe winners will be announced to both the awardee and the university department chairperson later this fall.

    "text": "The Calvary Christian College Science Department recently hosted its third successful Endemic Science Expo.\nEndemic in this context means learners identify a problem within a 5km radius of their school and develop a scientific solution using one of the sciences studied at school – earth sciences (geography), biological science (life science), or physical science.\nThis approach helps learners apply their knowledge to real-world issues, demonstrating the practical value of their studies.\nTwo distinguished guests and judges, Professor Oupa Mashile from Unisa and Mary Williams, central regional director of ISASA, were present to interact with learners and provide valuable feedback on their projects.\nLearners demonstrate how their science project works to a guest. The Endemic Science Expo provides budding scientists a platform to showcase their talents and innovations, offering practical solutions to challenges faced by their communities.\nScience teacher and expo organiser, Mr Muleya, said: “This talent would remain hidden unless we provide a platform for these young minds to grow and develop their inquisitiveness. We need to support these young people so their creative ideas do not go to waste but become meaningful solutions.”\nParticipants included young scientists from schools such as St Mary’s (Waverley), Broadacres, and Calvary Christian College itself. Many focused on addressing basic resource needs in informal settlements around Gauteng, such as access to clean water and electricity.\nOarabile Nkabinde from Calvary Christian College and her winning exhibit. The winning project, by Grade Nine learner Oarabile Nkabinde from Calvary Christian College, detailed scientific methods for harvesting and filtering water to make it accessible to communities. The project demonstrated an impressive understanding of the role of science in society, earning well-deserved praise from the school.\nLearners from several schools also attended to view exhibits and exchange ideas with the participants.\nCalvary Christian College expressed heartfelt gratitude to their major sponsors, Voltex and MajorTech, for their generous ongoing support. Thanks were also extended to Mobile Gals and the school’s head boy parents for contributing to the event’s success.\nFor more information or to register for next year’s event, schools can email principal@calvarychristiancollege.co.za .",
