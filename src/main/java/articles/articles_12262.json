    "title": "UK deal-making at lowest level since the financial crisis as higher rates and global tensions dent confidence",
    "text": "Dealmaking involving UK companies has fallen to its lowest level since 2009 as higher interest rates and rising geopolitical tensions dent bankers’ confidence. Figures from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) revealed that the value of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in 2023 totalled just £208billion, 33 per cent less than last year. It is less than half the level of 2021 – a big year for deals as the world emerged from global lockdowns when the value of UK M&A totalled £516billion. The latest fall comes as wider global dealmaking also suffers a downturn, falling in value by 17 per cent to £2.3trillion. However, the City’s slump was worse than the 6 per cent decline seen in the US and the 28 per cent fall in dealmaking in Europe. Slowdown: Figures from the London Stock Exchange revealed the value of merger and acquisition activity in 2023 totalled just £208bn, 33% less than 2022 That will do nothing to relieve the gloom surrounding London’s status as a hub for global companies – with many deserting the UK despite reforms designed to halt the exodus. Lucille Jones, of LSEG Deals Intelligence, blamed the decline on rising interest rates and a gloomy economic outlook, as well as stricter enforcement by regulators of competition rules. Jones also said geopolitical tensions – such as the conflict in the Middle East – are adding to global uncertainty. But she added: ‘The year ended more strongly than it began, and with inflation coming down and rates normalising, it could give chief executives and boards a little more confidence.’ The figures showed that more than 5,500 deals involving UK companies were announced this year, down 19 per cent on 2022. But ‘outbound’ M&A – where a British firm is involved in buying an overseas company – was up year-on-year by 12 per cent, to £81billion. Globally, the top five deals were all-American transactions – the biggest being oil giant Exxon Mobil’s £51billion takeover of shale firm Pioneer.",

    "title": "Why NIKKE Players Felt Let Down by the Evangelion Crossover Event",
    "text": "It looks like Shift Up’s crossover with Neon Genesis Evangelion in Goddess of Victory: NIKKE didn’t exactly match the expectations. A recent interview with Nikke’s producer revealed what they think went wrong in the Nikke x Evangelion collab that dropped in August 2024.\nWhat Went Wrong?\nAccording to Shift Up, the Evangelion collab event had a few flaws. It featured Rei, Asuka, Mari and Misato in outfits that stayed faithful to their original designs, but players weren’t exactly racing to snag them.\nApparently, the initial designs for the Evangelion characters by team Shift Up and Nikke were deemed too erotic for Evangelion’s creators. So, they later toned down things a bit. The faithful designs pleased the licensors, but the ‘modified’ aesthetics didn’t please the audience.\nWhat Did the Players Think?\nIt’s not just the outfits that missed the mark. Players didn’t feel much incentive to spend on limited-time characters or costumes, especially when the skins didn’t add much flair. The most expensive option, Asuka’s gacha skin, looked way too similar to her base model, which definitely didn’t interest any player.\nPeople love Goddess of Victory: NIKKE for its unapologetically over-the-top anime girls and compelling writing. But its recent collabs have diluted that identity, so players think that it’s just not worth the effort.\nNikke already has a strong foundation but the uninspired designs and the entire Evangelion event felt quite stretched out. Shift Up says they’re taking feedback into account for future events, and here’s hoping they actually do.\nMeanwhile, you can check out the games Neon Genesis Evangelion and Goddess of Victory: NIKKE on the Google Play Store. Instead of half-baked crossovers, I hope we get to see Shift Up turn things around and dropping amazing content in the coming months.\nBefore leaving, read our news on Wuthering Waves’ Version 1.4 Update on Android.",
