    "text": "Birmingham City Schools (BCS) ranks first in Alabama for mathematics recovery, with average achievement up half a grade-level equivalent in one year\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. , Sept. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Academic recovery at a national level remains stagnant, and achievement gaps between poor and non-poor districts in most states have deepened since the pandemic. However, many Council of the Great City Schools (CGCS) member districts are bucking the trend and closing learning gaps for their students. A member of CGCS and partner of Curriculum Associates, Birmingham City Schools (BCS) is leading the state of Alabama in mathematics achievement.\nA study of 8,000 school districts across 30 states found that Alabama is the only state in which students' average mathematics proficiency exceeds pre-pandemic levels. BCS has set itself apart, as its districtwide recovery efforts resulted in students' mathematics achievement increasing half a grade-level equivalent in just one year. A majority (i.e., 87 percent) of BCS students have socioeconomic disadvantages.\n\"We are at a pivotal moment in our nation's academic recovery efforts, and the steps we take now have a tremendous impact on students' abilities to reach or exceed grade-level learning in math and reading,\" said Kelly-Ann Parson , sales director at Curriculum Associates. \"Districts like Birmingham City Schools show us that success is possible. We are inspired by the district's dedication to finding new ways to support its students and educators, and it is our privilege to partner with BCS to continue improving student outcomes.\"\nFrom 2022 to 2023, the number of BCS students scoring \"on track\" or \"mastered\" on the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment Program in Mathematics grew by four percentage points across Grades 3–8. Growth in Grades 3 and 7 was particularly impressive at 6.6 and 7.2 percentage points, respectively. This growth outpaced Alabama state averages.\n\"We wanted to layer all the supports available to us,\" said Mark Sullivan , BCS superintendent. \"These supports included enrolling students in enrichment sessions, implementing wraparound services, and partnering with area universities to engage undergraduates in providing high-intensity tutoring to BCS students.\"\nCGCS students represent a large percentage of i-Ready users, with nearly 2.5 million Grades K–8 students in CGCS member districts using the platform nationwide. Ninety-five percent of CGCS member districts with mathematics data and 61 percent with reading data exceeded the national average in post-pandemic recovery.\nTo learn more about CGCS, visit CGCS.org.

    "title": "Myles Garrett added to the injury report Thursday with a back injury; status uncertain for Bengals game",
    "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The NFL football gods are certainly going to make Myles Garrett work for that half-sack he needs to reach 100.\nSitting at 99.5 sacks since the end of the 27-14 loss to the Steelers two games ago, that half-sack to reach the coveted milestone has been hard to come by.\nGarrett was added to the injury report on Thursday with a back injury and didn’t practice. His status for the Bengals game Sunday in Cincinnati is uncertain.\nDuring last Sunday’s 21-7 loss to the Chiefs, Garrett was held sackless despite coming close to taking down Patrick Mahomes a number of times. He was working primarily against All-Pro guard Joe Thuney, who slid over to replace inactive starter D.J. Humphries (hamstring).\nThuney, with some chipping help, gave Garrett one of his better battles of the season, but also inadvertently poked him in the eye at the end of the half in an incident that had Garrett on the ground and writhing in pain.\nHe went to the locker room to be examined, but jogged back out to the roar of the crowd after missing only four defensive plays, and finished the game. Afterward, his eye was red and swollen.\nMore Cleveland Browns coverage\nOn Monday, he visited his eye specialist and was cleared to participate fully in Wednesday’s practice. He did not appear on the injury report Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, Garrett participated in the walk-through, but walked inside during stretching before the regular practice session with two other injured players, David Njoku (hamstring) and Shelby Harris (elbow).\nIt’s not yet known if Garrett suffered the back injury in practice, a workout, or Sunday’s game, and his status for Sunday is uncertain. The Browns have one more full practice on Friday, which is when the game status report comes out. If he’s listed as questionable, it could come down to a gametime decision.\nBut Garrett would have to practically be in traction not to play. Known for playing hurt, he eagerly went back into the Chiefs game Sunday despite the swollen and painful eye. With the Browns at 3-10 at the time, no one would’ve blamed him for shutting it down.\nWhy didn’t he?\n“I’m a fighter,” he said. “Fighters fight. My brothers are out there, they’re doing the same thing and if I can go out there and make any kind of difference, I’m going to be out there with them every single time. I’ve had injuries, I’ve had pain, I’ve had illnesses. That doesn’t change anything.\n“They’re going to get every bit of the best out of me, every situation, every opportunity ... I’m going to do everything I can to be a difference for this team as long as I’m out there and as long as I can be out there, because I love this organization and I love this team. I love my brothers.”\nIn Cincinnati, Garrett will likely face another guard sliding over to tackle in Cody Ford, who’s expected to face starter Orlando Brown (fibula). Brown hasn’t practiced either of the past two days.\n“Yeah, I’m in favor of that,” defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz said “I mean, everybody has a plan. They’ve been using a lot more tight ends in the backfield, particularly on third down. There’s a lot of third downs where there’s no running back in the game and they’re using their tight ends to protect and chip and help them in blitzes and also help versus edge rushers. So it’s not just going to be a one-on-one battle. It’ll be coverage, it’ll be beating protections, it’ll be winning one-on-one matchups. Sort of the way it always is.”\nTied for fifth in the NFL with 11.0 sacks this season, Garrett -- the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year -- can tie Bruce Smith and Lawrence Taylor as the fourth-fastest players to reach 100 sacks in 115 games if he takes down Joe Burrow on Sunday.\nHe was held sackless in the Bengals’ 21-14 victory in Cleveland on Oct. 20, but faced Brown that game. Overall, he’s sacked Burrow eight times in seven games, his most against any one QB.\nWill he get the chance to try on Sunday?\nFootball Insider newsletter free trial: Take a minute and sign up for a free trial of our Football Insider newsletter, featuring exclusive content from cleveland.com's Browns reporters.",

    "title": "4 Reasons Muslims Won the Victory in the Badar War | Republika Online",
    "text": "REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA -- The [ Badar War ](https://republika.co.id/tag/badar-war)was the first clash between Muslims and the Quraysh. But the victory was never bragged about by Muslims for fear that it would tempt the Quraysh to further attack Muslims all the way to Medina. According to About Islam, Friday (April 30) Muslims believe that the victory of the day is God's help. In addition, it is also because there are several supporting factors that make the victory achieved by Muslims. First, the Muslims fought under one command and the Prophet Muhammad himself was their commander-in-chief. Disciplined soldiers were what every war commander wanted, and the Muslim forces of that time were very disciplined. Although the Muslims were vastly outnumbered by the Quraysh, discipline and obedience to the commanders led the Muslims to victory. As a war commander, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not necessarily, he always consulted his companions in every decision he made. As for the infidels, they have no unity of purpose. Among the Quraysh, Abu Jahl was eager to kill the Prophet, especially after the death of the Prophet's uncle, Abu Tholib. Then the Utbah who also did not want the presence of the new teachings brought by the Prophet Muhammad could replace the teachings of their ancestors. These two ways of seeing Quraysh men were so different that it was enough to separate the Quraysh army. Second, the Prophet marched from Medina to Badar using a good strategy. The Prophet sent a patrol team to gather information, before war broke out. Thirdly, the goal of the two camps is a separate world. Muslims want to ensure freedom of thought, worship and expression for all. Muslims have been subjected to much suffering by the Quraysh for a decade and a half. It is time for the Quraysh to be taught a lesson in mutual respect for basic human rights. The goal of the Quraysh was only that outlined by Abu Jahl, which was to kill Muhammad and feast. Abu Jahl said: “We will march to Badar and stay there for three days. And we would slaughter camels to eat, throw big feasts and make it open for everyone to come and eat. We would drink a lot of wine and would be entertained by singers and dancers. If this is known, all the Arab tribes will amaze us for the rest of time”. It's a shortsighted goal of people driven by arrogance. Four, morale among Muslims was very high, even among them many who had just first joined the battle in Badar. Good equipment and numerical strength cannot win a battle if morale is absent. This applies to all wars, both ancient and modern. [buku Republika ...](https://bukurepublika.id)",
