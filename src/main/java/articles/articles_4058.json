    "text": "The National Weather Service Guam Weather Forecast Office on Friday advised gusty winds and dry conditions will cause a high fire threat. A fire weather watch remains in effect through Sunday afternoon for Guam. East winds of 20 to 30 mph, with gusts to 40 mph possible, and humidity at 50 to 60% during the day are expected. Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not recommended, NWS said. A high surf advisory is in effect for Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Monday along north and east facing reefs. Large breaking waves of 8 to 11 feet are expected. Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions. A high risk of rip currents is in effect for Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from Friday evening through late Sunday night. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. If caught in a rip current, do not swim against the current. Swim in a direction following the shoreline, face the shore and call or wave for help. A small craft advisory is in effect for the coastal waters of Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Monday. Northeast winds of 20 to 25 knots, with gusts to 30 knots, and seas of 10 to 13 feet are expected. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft. Inexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller vessels, should avoid boating in hazardous conditions. The Offices of Guam Homeland Security and Civil Defense remind the community to avoid hazardous surf and seas. Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water while the advisories are in effect. \"Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags, and signs. Refrain from outdoor burning,\" the agencies said.",

    "title": "Full list of police-recorded antisemitic and Islamophobic offences, by force",
    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK. The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents. Systems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. Some forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate. Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “ Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion. – Gwent Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3The force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries. – Hampshire & Isle of Wight Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6Islamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4 – Hertfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3The force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record. – Humberside Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2 – Kent Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6The force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached.

The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures. – Northumbria Antisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5The force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim. – Nottinghamshire Antisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7Islamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19The force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker. – South Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8Islamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9The force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”. – Suffolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0 – Surrey Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10The force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member. – Thames Valley Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21Islamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20 – Warwickshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3Islamophobic: No information heldThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods. – West Mercia Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4 – West Midlands Antisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22Islamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25The force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”. – West Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53Islamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49The force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted.

Burleson popped a solo home run -- his third of the spring -- in Wednesday's Grapefruit League tilt versus the Nationals.\nDrawing the start at first base, Burleson led off the bottom of the third inning with a long ball off of Jake Irvin. Although he's batting only .209 this spring, Burleson's three home runs trail only Luken Baker's four for the team lead. Burleson's playing time might be impacted if the Cardinals elect to go with Victor Scott or Michael Siani as their primary center fielder, as it would likely mean Nolan Gorman being used more at designated hitter. The left-handed hitting Burleson slashed .292/.341/.464 versus right-handed pitching last season but batted only .242/.306/.320 in the second half.\nMore News Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Could face playing time squeeze 8D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Won't play outfield this spring 13D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Drives in three in win 09/30/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Out again versus lefty 09/26/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Idle against southpaw 09/25/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Getting rest against lefty 09/21/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Baseball Stories Bullpen breakdown for all 30 teams Scott White • 4 min read Bold predictions for all 30 MLB Teams Chris Towers • 19 min read 12-team Roto mock draft Scott White • 4 min read Fantasy baseball rankings: ADP sleepers, busts CBS Sports Staff • 4 min read 2025 Fantasy baseball rankings: Sleepers to target CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read Draft Prep Guide (all in one place) CBS Interactive staff • 2 min read",

    "text": "While there has been little change during the past seven days, drought conditions have worsened in Kentucky compared to two weeks ago due to a continued lack of widespread rain, according to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor that was issued on Thursday morning. The December 28 report shows 13.01% of the state with no drought conditions, virtually the same as last week, but represents a large drop from the 22.79% in the report issued on December 14. The area designated “Abnormally Dry,” or D0 on the scale that runs from D0 to D4 based on drought severity, has grown slightly over the past two weeks, from 29.14% to 31.81%. “Moderate Drought” conditions (D1) have actually shrunk in area during the past 14 days, going from 37.39% to 36.34% of the state, but that was more than made up for by the increase in “Severe Drought” (D2) during that same period, which grew from 10.68% to 18.64%. There are no parts of Kentucky that have been designated either “Extreme Drought,” (D3) or “Exceptional Drought,” (D4). See the map that accompanies this story for drought conditions in your area. Note that data for the U.S Drought Monitor is collected on Tuesday mornings, with the report issued on Thursdays, so the small amount of precipitation that fell on Wednesday is not factored into this report. Looking ahead, the Climate Prediction Center’s latest 6–10-day outlook, issued Dec. 27 for the period Jan. 2-6, is calling for near normal temperatures and below normal precipitation. Beyond that, the 8-14-day outlook, covering Jan. 4-10, is forecasting near normal temperatures for northern Kentucky and slightly below normal in the rest of the state. Precipitation is expected to be near normal along and north of a line from Paducah to Maysville, and slightly above normal in the remainder of Kentucky. The U.S. Drought Monitor is produced through a partnership between the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and NOAA.
