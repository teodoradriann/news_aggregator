    "title": "Governor Hochul Vetoes NYS Non-Compete Bill",
    "text": "On December 22, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul vetoed a bill that would have imposed a ban on non-compete clauses throughout the state of New York for all employees, regardless of earnings level. We wrote about the Senate and Assembly bills that were passed in June, here. Many business groups and trade associations criticized the bills as overbroad and lacking common sense exceptions, such as permitting non-competes in connection with the sale of a business. Although we did not think that the bill would be signed into law as it was drafted, we expected that the Governor and lawmakers would arrive at a compromise and include exceptions, such as banning non-competes for employees who earn below a particular threshold. Previously, Governor Hochul had proposed limiting the ban to individuals who earned in excess of $250,000 in total annual compensation. However, this agreement never materialized. The Governor remains committed to enacting non-compete legislation and State Senator Sean Ryan (D), the bill’s sponsor, vows to reintroduce the bill in the next legislative session. For now, non-compete restrictions are alive and well in New York.

He further claimed that children had memorised Christian religious prayers and threatened to sue under the JJ Act and the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act of 2021.\nHe further claimed that children as young as 10 years old were forced to trim grass and clean toilets on the grounds, and warned that appropriate action would be done by submitting a warning to the Madhya Pradesh Government's Chief Secretary.\nOn his official social media account, the NCPCR chairman announced his visit to the tribal parts of Dewas district, saying he toured two separate institutions run by misisonary groups.\n\"Today, during my visit to the tribal areas of Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh, I inspected two different institutions, both of which were being run by missionary organisations,\" he posted on X.\nआज मध्य प्रदेश के देवास जिले के आदिवासी अंचलों में दौरे के दौरान दो अलग-अलग संस्थाओं का निरीक्षण किया दोनों ही संस्थान मिशनरी संस्थाओं द्वारा चलाए जा रहे थे।\nजे जे एक्ट की परिभाषा में CNCP बच्चों को पंजीकृत बालगृह में CWC के आदेश से ही रखा जा सकता है,यहाँ इस क़ानून का खुला… pic.twitter.com/u5K1imKzLW\n— प्रियंक कानूनगो Priyank Kanoongo (@KanoongoPriyank) December 23, 2023\nThe Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act of 2005 established the NCPCR as a statutory entity. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has administrative jurisdiction over it. The commission's mandate is to ensure that all laws, policies, programmes, and administrative procedures are consistent with the vision of children's rights.\nKanoonga noted in his article that children in need of care and protection (CNCP) can only be held in registered children's homes with CWC orders, according to the definition of the JJ Act.\n\"Here, a blatant violation of this law has been seen as the institutions did not submit the registration documents,\" he alleged.\n\"Almost all the children are Hindus; however, the children offer Christian prayers at the institution. The children have learned Christian religious prayers by heart. Innocent children as young as 10 years of age are made to cut grass, sweep and even clean toilets on the premises,\" he further alleged in his post.\nAccording to the NCPCR chairman, their team discovered \"evidence\" of \"foreign funding\" for the institution.\n\"Our team has also found evidence of foreign funding and high political contacts of the institute; it is clear that influential people in the tribal areas are using their influence to do the dirty work of converting innocent children,\" he added in his post.\n\"Due action will be taken by issuing a notice to the Chief Secretary of the Madhya Pradesh Government,\" he further added in his post.",
