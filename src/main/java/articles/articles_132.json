Coming in at 94 on the list was Cassidy. Now in his third season as the Golden Knights’ head coach, Cassidy has put together an impressive resume. He’s been to the Stanley Cup finals twice, once with the Boston Bruins where he fell short and once with the Golden Knights where he was triumphant. He’s won the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the NHL and the Louis AR Pieri Award for the best…\nRead more at\n thehockeynews.com",

    "text": "Mal Meninga has effectively ruled out picking Latrell Mitchell for the end-of-year Pacific Championships, as South Sydney fight to avoid any NRL ban going into next season.\nMitchell has emerged from his moon boot and began rehabilitation on his foot, after returning to the Rabbitohs headquarters from personal leave.\nWith an NRL breach notice still hanging over his head and questions over when a one-match ban will be served, Mitchell has had positive scans on the state of his foot.\nSouth Sydney had long held hope that Mitchell could return this season if they remained in finals contention, after he was hurt before State of Origin III.\nBut even if he is fit, Meninga indicated on Friday that Mitchell would not form part of his Australian squad for the end-of-season Pacific Championships against New Zealand and Tonga.\n“At this stage we’re unsure where Latrell is. But I don’t think he has probably played enough games and in a good headspace to be in contention,” Meninga said.\nLatrell Mitchell is tackled. (Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images)\n“Tommy Turbo (Trbojevic) showed again last night how great of a player he is, he can play anywhere. I’m not quite sure where Bradman Best is.\n“We’ve obviously got Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, he has played centres. Kotoni Staggs has had a great back-end of the year as well.\n“We’ve got some quality players we can pick from.”\nMeninga’s comments come as the Rabbitohs push hard for any ban given to Mitchell by the NRL integrity unit for the white-powder photo to be served this year.\nWhile particulars of the sanction are yet to be published, AAP has been told the NRL is proposing a one-match ban for the fullback as well as a monetary fine.\nThere is also a push from head office for the ban to be served at the start of next year, given Mitchell’s injury.\nBut the Rabbitohs are adamant any suspension should be served immediately, allowing Mitchell to start next year under returning coach Wayne Bennett.\nThey are trying to use the controversial delayed ban dished out to fallen Panthers star Taylan May two years ago as a way of ensuring Mitchell does not get suspended for Round 1 in 2025.\nARL chair Peter V’landys copped plenty of criticism at the time for claiming the ban was delayed “for the fans”.\nWin a Ziggy BBQ for Grand Final day, thanks to Barbeques Galore! Enter Here.\n“Why penalise the Penrith fans for an indiscretion the player did?”\nThere are also numerous examples of players serving bans for on-field indiscretions while injured, with Parramatta’s Kelma Tuilagi doing so this year.\nSouth Sydney are also understood to have the support of the Rugby League Players Association, with the issue likely to drag into next week.\nMay ended up tearing his ACL the following pre-season and served his ban while he was sidelined through injury.\nInterim Rabbitohs coach Ben Hornby wouldn’t be drawn into the debate on Friday, but said Mitchell had seemed in better spirits in the past week.\n“The Latrell stuff will take care of itself, the club will take care of it, and we’ll go from there,” Hornby said ahead of Saturday’s clash with Newcastle.\n“It has been tough (for him). He knows he put himself in that position as well. He is starting to come out of it, he’s been a lot better this week.”\nMitchell is also due to front South Sydney’s board in the next week over his behaviour, the white-powder image coming at the end of a drama-charged year.\nBelieved to have been taken while Mitchell was in Dubbo for a football clinic earlier this month, the image prompted the latest round of headlines centring around the game’s most recognisable player.\nMitchell raised eyebrows with a profane radio interview in March and missed three games for raising his elbow into Shaun Johnson’s face while coach Jason Demetriou’s job was on the line the next month.\nMore League Five and a Kick: Raiders overrun Penrith in emotional scenes, Storm embarrass Phins, Knights stay alive South Sydney Rabbitohs vs Newcastle Knights: NRL live scores Round 25 Team Lists Late Mail: Sharks speedster suffers setback, Roosters rake injured, Manly centre out, key Warrior back Melbourne Storm vs Dolphins: NRL live scores NRLW Round 5: Cowboys all but end Raiders' season as medical farce delays Knights' big win over Eels League Canterbury football boss and media pundit Phil Gould has been among Mitchell’s most vocal critics this week, questioning his professionalism and Souths’ management of their star man.\nMitchell has returned to South Sydney training to begin rehabilitation on his foot.\n“The Latrell stuff will take care of itself, the club will take care of it, and we’ll go from there,” Hornby said ahead of Saturday’s clash with Newcastle.\n“It has been tough (for him). He knows he put himself in that position as well. He is starting to come out of it, he’s been a lot better this week.\n“He’s had his scan, that came back positive so he is out of the boot now.\n“The conjecture is whether he can run or not. We’ve just got to go through the process. He’s got out of the boot, who knows how long it will take.\n“He can get on the cardio equipment, but he hasn’t been able to train.”\nSea Eagle banned for high shot Manly second-rower Corey Waddell has been slapped with a two-game suspension by the NRL match review committee, for his high hit on Tiger Solomon Alaimalo in the Sea Eagles’ shock loss on Thursday night.\nWaddell was the third of three Manly players to be sin-binned on a controversial night at Leichhardt Oval, catching Alaimalo in the face with his wrist during a tackle attempt midway through the second half.\nIn confusing scenes, initial replays seemed to suggest Taniela Paseka was in greater trouble, having caught the Tiger high with his shoulder moments later, but despite lighter contact, Waddell’s indiscretion saw him sent to the sin-bin alone by referee Peter Gough.\nThe forward, who returned to the Sea Eagles this season after a three-year stint with Canterbury, had his shot deemed a grade two careless high tackle, triggering a two-game ban for his second offence, ruling Waddell out of Manly’s critical final two home-and-away matches against the Bulldogs and Sharks.\nPaseka is facing a $1000 fine for his role in the tackle.\nWaddell risks a three-match ban should he and the Sea Eagles choose to challenge the suspension at the judiciary.\nHaumole Olakau’atu has escaped without a ban after he was sin-binned early in the second half of the Sea Eagles’ 34-26 loss at Leichhardt, for a shot on Tigers fullback Heath Mason.\nThe perfect bounce for Faataape and the Tigers make it ????️ tries in a row\n????

MATCH CENTRE https://t.co/1ReDpMU39j pic.twitter.com/AWD22o2aBe\n— Fox League (@FOXNRL) August 22, 2024 While off the field, the Tigers ran in two crucial tries to go from 16-10 down to 22-16 up.\nReplays of the hit appeared to suggest the contact had been shoulder on shoulder, but Gough deemed it worthy of a sin-bin.\nThe match review committee opted for a lower-end sanction on Friday, handing Olakau’atu a grade-one charge and $3000 fine with an early guilty plea.\nThe NSW State of Origin second-rower was one of three Manly players sin-binned in the loss, with Ethan Bullemor also marched for repeated offences.\nHaving led the Tigers 16-0, the Sea Eagles leaked 30 straight points to the Tigers in their 26-34 defeat, to leave their finals hopes precariously poised.\nFive points clear of the ninth-placed Dolphins, they would need to lose both their remaining matches and have Wayne Bennett’s team upset the ladder-leading Storm on Saturday afternoon to miss out, but the shock loss on Thursday night has all but put paid to their top-four hopes, and left them fighting an uphill battle to secure a home elimination final.\nArthur gets Super new deal Brad Arthur has agreed to an initial one-year contract to extend his stay as Leeds head coach.\nThe 50-year-old Australian, who took over at Headingley until the end of the current Super League season in July, will now remain in the role until at least the end of the 2025 campaign.\nArthur, who was head coach at 2022 NRL grand-finalists Parramatta for 10 seasons, told therhinos.co.uk: “I said I would only stay if I felt I could make a difference.\n“It is a big decision to move to the other side of the world, especially for my family.\nGold Coast Titans v Sydney Roosters 4.85 1.18 NRL : Head To Head Sun, 25 Aug 2024, 14:00 St. George Illawarra Dragons v Cronulla Sharks 2.15 1.70 NRL : Head To Head Sun, 25 Aug 2024, 16:05 * Odds Correct At Time Of Posting.

    "text": "Read full article AFP Martinez penalty heroics take Villa to Conference League semis AFP Fri, Apr 19, 2024, 12:24 AM · 3 min read Link Copied Emiliano Martinez quietens the crowd during the penalty shootout (Sameer Al-DOUMY)\nEmiliano Martinez starred in a drama-filled penalty shootout as Aston Villa squeezed past Lille and into the Europa Conference League semi-finals on Thursday following a late Matty Cash goal in normal time.\nVilla led 2-1 from last week's first leg but their quest for a first European trophy since 1982 looked doomed when goals from Yusuf Yazici and Benjamin Andre put Lille two up on the night and 3-2 ahead in the tie in northern France.\nA defensive mishap allowed Cash to bring Villa even with three minutes left though before Martinez, displaying his trademark dark arts, saved twice in the shootout as Unai Emery's side won 4-3 in the shootout.\n\"He is very important for us. He has his personality and his personality in the dressing room is very important because he is a leader with his experiences. He has a really brilliant mentality,\" said Emery.\n\"And then on the pitch he has his personality and he played fantastic. He saved two penalty shots so of course I am very proud of him. I am very proud of all the players.\"\nThe Argentina goalkeeper saved spot-kicks from Nabil Bentaleb and Andre after being whistled loudly throughout the game by a crowd that had not forgotten his celebrations after the 2022 World Cup final win over France.\nThere was a confusing moment during the shootout when he was shown a second yellow card for more antics, including pressing his finger to his lips, but rules dictate that any bookings picked up in the match are reset before penalties commence.\nIt was a compelling finale to an evening that began with Lille quickly erasing Villa's advantage, making full use of the extra rest afforded to them against a side who beat Arsenal 2-0 on Sunday.\n- Lille start strongly -\nYazici steered home 15 minutes in to haul Paulo Fonseca's team level over the two legs before Lille captain Andre glanced in a corner midway through the second half.\nBut with the Ligue 1 club heading towards their first major European semi-final, a defensive mix-up in the closing minutes proved costly.\nCash hammered the ball home to bring Villa even at 3-3 on aggregate after Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier spilled a looping cross following a collision with Bentaleb.\nChevalier redeemed himself with a sensational save from Douglas Luiz in extra time, reacting sharply to scoop the Brazilian's header over the crossbar after parrying a powerful shot from Leon Bailey .\nBut Martinez had the final say in the shootout after Chevalier saved Bailey's attempt, with Villa moving on to face Olympiakos or Fenerbahce in the last four.\nLast season's runners-up Fiorentina sealed a return to the semi-finals with a 2-0 win over 10-man Viktoria Plzen after extra time.\nCadu was sent off in the second half for a foul on the edge of the Plzen box and Fiorentina made the extra man count when Nico Gonzalez struck in the 92nd minute.\nSkipper Cristiano Biraghi added a second on 108 minutes as the Italians progressed 2-0 on aggregate.\nSpanish striker Ferran Jutgla got both goals for Club Brugge in a 2-0 win in Greece as the Belgians eased through 3-0 over the two legs.\nmw/dj",

    "text": "View gallery Image Credit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\nWinter is in full swing and stars like Jennifer Lopez , 54, are fleeing to warmer climates! The Marry Me actress was photographed enjoying a getaway in St. Barts on December 27 and turned heads in her beach attire . For J.Lo’s stroll on the beach, she rocked a white string bikini top and a pink towel wrapped around her waist.\nJennifer accessorized with a few beach essentials. In the photos ( seen here ), the brunette bombshell added a wide-brim sunhat, oversized sunglasses, and a few gold bracelets to her ensemble. J.Lo wore her giant diamond wedding ring from hubby Ben Affleck . While she enjoyed her vacation, the mother-of-two was seemingly still plugged in and was spotted chatting on the phone with her wired headphones.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo)\nAfter photos of her bikini moment in St. Barts landed on social media, Jennifer’s fans took to the comments to react. “Bummer, I’m not there as usual,” one admirer joked , while another tweeted , “Wow @JLo is so beautiful.” A separate fan called Jennifer’s look “Effortlessly chic.” J.Lo was seemingly sans Ben during her R&R moment, as he was not pictured by her side that afternoon.\nIt’s been a few months since Jennifer has been spotted in a bikini, as the winter months began. Prior to her island getaway, Jennifer took to Instagram to show off a pink one-piece swimsuit over the Fourth of July weekend. “Hope everyone had a great holiday weekend filled with love, family, friends and fun,” she captioned the sexy carousel of poolside photos at the time. She completed her plunging swimsuit with gold hoop earrings and a matching gold nameplate necklace.\nMost recently, Bennifer went viral online after the Gone Girl star was pictured checking his phone during a make out session with J.Lo on December 21. The duo was photographed shopping at Maxfield in West Hollywood just days before Christmas when the PDA moment took place. Jennifer was photographed packing on the PDA with her man while he was tuned into his smartphone. A few days prior, Jennifer stunned in a sequined green gown while hosting her Christmas party and singing holiday classics at home.",

    "title": "Hurricane Milton’s forecast track was stunningly accurate",
    "text": "A stunningly precise forecast of Hurricane Milton’s track gave Floridians a strong head start to prepare this past week. It marked the latest instance that a major hurricane has been mapped in precise detail — its path was accurately predicted a whole four days before it made landfall. Milton’s first cone forecast came out on Saturday morning, Oct. 5. The center of the cone put a bull’s-eye on Sarasota. Four days later, Milton made landfall just about four miles south, on Siesta Key. Similarly, forecasts for Hurricane Helene formed before the system even had a name, and they were right on target , as the storm made landfall on Sept. 26 in the Big Bend area of the Florida Gulf Coast. The accuracy of hurricane forecasts has improved through the years, and the recent forecasts for Helene and Milton were notably accurate. Yet, there’s no guarantee that all forecasts will be so precise — given the chaotic nature of hurricanes, and the minute changes that can have massive impacts on land. “We got Helene right; Beryl was pretty close,” said Craig Setzer, a meteorologist and hurricane preparedness specialist. “This one was a pretty good track forecast. But you never really know until it’s over.” Milton’s path toward Florida During Milton’s four days of traveling across the Gulf, there was a persistent, anxiety-inducing wiggle to the storm’s path. One day the centerline traveled over St. Petersburg and Tampa Bay, the next it was back down at Sarasota, then back up to St. Petersburg, then Sarasota. Each shift struck fear or relief, depending on the projected location. That fear was based on the fact that the leading right-hand quadrant of a hurricane is the “dirty” side, where the winds are strongest, and push the most water. If Tampa was south of the eye, that dirty side would shoot water into the funnel-shaped bay, resulting in a forecasted 15 feet of storm surge. To put that wiggle in perspective, St. Petersburg and Sarasota are 40 or 50 miles apart. The storm was traveling from 500 miles away, and not in a straight path — forecasters had to anticipate a turn to the left (northeast) at some point, and then a turn east to shore. And to clarify, the National Hurricane Center instructs the public to consider the entire cone as a probable path of the eye of the storm. It’s difficult for many to not focus on the centerline, though. Regardless of those wiggles, the forecast was startlingly accurate. Gaining strength very quickly When Milton was a mere tropical system, it loitered in the bottom horseshoe of the Gulf, west of the Yucatan Peninsula, and became more organized. Setzer said that when he woke up the morning of Oct. 5 and looked at satellite imagery, he immediately thought, “This is going to be a problem,” because it was getting organized so quickly. The high that was holding it in place eased, and Milton took off east. Forecasters knew a trough would eventually turn it northeast toward Florida. They also projected, because Gulf waters were so hot and wind shear so absent, that the storm would vault to monstrous Category 5 strength, then oscillate between Category 4 and 5 before hitting wind shear close to shore and weakening again. All these changes put residents on high alert across the state. As a result, the state urged millions of people to leave Florida’s western coast, triggering one of the biggest evacuations in the state’s history. “This was all predicted, but you don’t know exactly how sharp the turn is going to be, or when it’s going to take place . The Hurricane Center did a great job with all those things,” Setzer said. The path accuracy came in part from understanding the timing of a big low-pressure trough to the north. “There was a trough that was swinging down across the southern U.S. and into the Gulf,” said Luke Culver, of the National Weather Service, “and that was what picked up Milton and brought it northeast, into the Gulf Coast.” Five days out, the National Hurricane Center’s modeling deciphered when the trough would intersect Milton, and how that would change the storm’s trajectory. “Obviously the timing of that, when the trough grabbed Milton and how fast Milton was moving, was really what determined how far north or south it was going to make landfall,” Culver said. Jeff Berardelli, chief meteorologist and climate specialist at WFLA-TV in Tampa Bay, said that as the storm traveled northeast, all the forecast models showed an eventual turn to the east, into shore. “Our challenge was to figure out which models were more accurate with the timing of the eastward turn. If it happened too late, the storm would have gone right to Tampa Bay and it would have been a worst-case scenario, with 15 feet of surge in Tampa and St. Pete. But either way it was going to be a bad scenario for someone.” Berardelli said that the consensus of the models showed a track just south of Tampa Bay. “That gave us a little more confidence,” he said. “This was a testament to the fact that our models really are getting better,” Setzer said. Still, the little 50-mile wiggle made a world of difference to densely populated Tampa Bay, which didn’t want to be on the southern, or “dirty” right side of the storm. Setzer said it was great track forecast. But with Tampa Bay’s dense population, and the shape of the bay, a 50-mile shift in the track could produce minimal storm surge, or massive storm surge, with hundreds of thousands of homes impacted. “The difference of those 50 miles couldn’t have been more stark,” he said. Why all the nerve-racking wobbles? Small wobbles are always happening as a hurricane travels, but once there’s a big human population in the bull’s-eye, people start to notice the minute changes, Setzer said. “The wobbles happen because a hurricane is not completely vertically stacked,” he said, “or it could be tilted a little bit by some wind shear, or sometimes we have smaller spins inside of a larger circulation. “As that inside cog is spinning around a bigger wheel, it pulls that bigger wheel left and right, so little wobbles are very common. But as they get close to the coast they make a huge difference to people’s lives.” Berardelli made his forecasts from Tampa as those wobbles happened. “When you’re taking about a hair making such a big difference, it’s a nerve-racking forecast,” he said. “But no matter where this storm went, someone was going to see disastrous consequences.”",
