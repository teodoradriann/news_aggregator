You have no concept of your own environment and history.\nYou label it as the elites wanting \"all the money.\" Yet, in today's western society, most live like kings even compared to historical royalty.\nHumanity is better off now than it ever was. Less violent. More spreading of wealth across the board. Just because you don't have a bunch of shit for free, doesn't mean the whole thing is shit.\nIt's people like you who prevent us from spreading our revolutionary ways to the rest of the world so the whole planet can continue to move toward liberty and prosperity.\nSharing is a natural outgrowth of prosperity. Scums like you try to rob us of our ability to share freely and then call us greedy. You are the greedy ones. That is why you are so obsessed with and fixated on other people's money.\nI saw these assholes in 1999 and they turned many good people away from activism because of their fascist violent ways.\nThe elites need you. They feed off you like a parasite. And you are so stupid to believe they have any problem with you.\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 73976312\nUnited States\n08/17/2017 03:05 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: WTO 1999 Seattle Re-visited. 50,000 fought and suffered for all life on earth.\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 1010415\n[\nlink to heliofant.com\n] November 30 1999 September 11 2001 August 21 2017\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 61995349\nUnited States\n08/17/2017 10:27 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: WTO 1999 Seattle Re-visited. 50,000 fought and suffered for all life on earth.\n... and what did they achieve ???\nQuoting:\nMr. Predictor\nNothing.\nBut what did we get from WTO?

Area . There was a lot of murmurs about this group being briefed/trained by C I a , before arriving in Seattle\nMind you it did not help that even the peaceful protesters were unloaded on by Seattle PD before any windows smashed or fires started\nBut the groups roaming the streets that night, well picture those people now training the 18 yr old SJW's out there now\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 75328508\nUnited States\n11/10/2017 05:33 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: WTO 1999 Seattle Re-visited. 50,000 fought and suffered for all life on earth.\n[\nlink to bilderberggroup.net\n]\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 61995349\n2017 Rip Baby Boomer Generation\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 75328508\nUnited States\n04/04/2018 06:28 AM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: WTO 1999 Seattle Re-visited. 50,000 fought and suffered for all life on earth.\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 1010415\nThe Anomaly was there!

    "text": "AL RAYYAN, Qatar (Reuters) -Iraq claimed their first victory over Japan in 42 years when they won their Asian Cup Group D encounter 2-1 on Friday to qualify for the knockout stage thanks to a first-half double from Aymen Hussein at the Education City Stadium.\nJapan were unbeaten against the West Asian side in their last nine games and Iraq's victory propelled them to the top of the group standings with six points from two games while Hajime Moriyasu's side have three points.\n\"Today is a great day for Iraqi people but for us it's just a win. We have six points, but the players must now think of Vietnam (in the last group game) and they need to rest,\" Iraq coach Jesus Casas told reporters.\n\"I'm very proud of my players. All Iraqi players should be proud... The perfect match is impossible, but we were close to the perfect match I wanted.\"\nRoared on by thousands of Iraqi supporters in the stadium, Iraq got on the board inside five minutes when Japan goalkeeper Zion Suzuki failed to deal with a cross, parrying the ball straight to Hussein who headed it into the top corner.\nIraq's strategy to unsettle Japan was to stay compact and use their physicality early on, which worked to an extent until the East Asian side began using their pace and finding space on the wings to put crosses into the box.\nJapan had a golden opportunity to equalise in the 22nd minute from a set piece when a header fell to Wataru Endo at the edge of the six-yard box, but the skipper was unable to direct an overhead kick into the net.\nIraq doubled their lead on the stroke of halftime when Ahmed Al-Hajjaj skipped past his marker and floated in a cross that was headed home from point-blank range by Hussein as the Iraqi fans went delirious.\nPENALTY DENIED\nBut Hussein went down injured just before the break and was replaced for the second half and though Iraqi fans were dejected when their hero did not take the field, they found their voice again when Japan were denied a penalty despite a VAR check.\nMoriyasu made five substitutions after the restart but the Samurai Blue rarely tested the keeper until the 94th minute when Endo headed home at the far post from a corner.\nThe atmosphere was tense in the dying minutes as Japan frantically sought an equaliser but Iraq held on for the three points to move top.\n\"We prepared the same way as we did for Vietnam but unfortunately we found ourselves in a difficult position, especially early on. The crowd and atmosphere made us feel like we were playing an away game,\" Moriyasu said.\n\"The second goal hit us hard, we must learn from our mistakes. The players fought hard and I must accept responsibility for the loss.\n\"We analysed before the game and knew how Iraq would play at the start, they did play very aggressive. Unfortunately we couldn't handle it, I know we need to do more.\"\n(Reporting by Rohith Nair in Doha; Editing by Ken Ferris and Toby Davis)\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "WORCESTER, Mass. – Joshua Sowden says a firsthand experience opened his eyes to the struggles of being homeless.\n\"My stepmother's sister was living in a homeless shelter and we went there,\" Joshua said. \"We gave her son an Easter basket, and I asked if the other kids had Easter. She said, 'no, unless they're donated.' And I really wanted to help out.\"\nFrom that one interaction, Sowden, a sixth-grader in Worcester, has only seen his passion grow. This year will be his fourth handing out baskets to homeless children in the area. What started with one basket to a family member has now grown to an estimated 310 he'll hand out in 2024.\nWhat You Need To Know Worcester sixth-grader Joshua Sowden is handing out Easter baskets to local homeless children\nThis year, he plans to hand out 310 baskets\nHis message hits home, as he and his family experienced homelessness last year\nInfants through 12 year olds will receive baskets \"It feels really nice to know that they're going to enjoy this year,\" Joshua said.\nThe young boy's message hit home even more last year, when he and his family were facing homelessness.\n\"We were told that we had to move, and we ended up in a hotel from the end of April until the week before Christmas,\" said Joshua's stepmother, Crystal Sowden.\nInfants through 12 year olds will receive baskets this year.\nWhen Spectrum News 1 paid Joshua a visit, his living room was reminiscent of a loading dock, with Amazon boxes full of Easter-themed gifts lining the floor.\nThis year, though, he's getting help from his friend, Jacob.\n\"One day I came here, and they had all the boxes,\" said Jacob. \"And I was like, \"What's up with the boxes?\" They told me the story and they asked me if I wanted to help. And I said 'yeah.'\"\n\"It makes me really happy that other people want to be involved in this and help out,\" responded Joshua.\nJoshua will hand out the baskets at two shelters, one in Worcester and the other in Hudson. They'll also be donated to kids living in the hotel Joshua lived in last year.\n\"Knowing what a difference it's going to give these kids, especially after what we saw last year. Being able to give them a smile, even for a couple hours, is huge,\" said Crystal Sowden.\nThey'll hand them out on March 23, hoping to be a beam of light for some who may be in a dark time of their lives.",

    "text": "For tonight's Netflix viewing, how about a film with graphic, unsimulated sex scenes which was banned in its native country? Yep, a film that was too full-on to be shown in cinemas is now available to watch at the click of a button, if that sort of thing sounds appealing. This Indian-made film from 2010 was directed by Qaushiq Mukherjee, known as 'Q', who had the vision of creating an abstract film with elements of sex weaved into the storyline. Advert And with anything involving sex in cinema, some people had their reservations. However even the most risqué directors might not have opted for Mukherjee’s decision to include unsimulated sex scenes in his movie. So you can understand why some people got into quite a huff about the film. Since even in the most believable film sex scenes, more often than not the two actors aren’t actually doing the deed. Advert They’ll use crafty camera work to create the illusion. This film? Not so much. The film is called Gandu, which translates to 'a e', and it's now available to stream on [Netflix](https://www.unilad.com/netflix). The film follows a teenage rapper who steals from his mother's lover to fund his love for [drugs](https://www.unilad.com/drugs), all while trying to make it in the [music](https://www.unilad.com/music) industry. There are numerous graphic sex scenes between Gandu’s mother (Kamalika Banerjee) and her lover Dasbabu (Silajit Majumder), which main character Gandu (Anubrata Basu) walks in on. Advert If that wasn’t explicit enough for you, in one of the film’s most controversial scenes, Basu has a fully erect penis in a sex scene with co-star Rii Sen, with Q saying that the pair had real-life sex. What makes it even weirder? Sen was actually in a relationship with Q when they shot the scene. She [told ](https://openthemagazine.com/art-culture/the-candid-killer-of-camera-shyness/)Open magazine: “There were physical workshops that helped us shed our inhibitions and become real. If someone were to touch my boobs, it's natural that I'd be aroused. Advert “But it is the aftermath that is important. How do you feel after such a shoot? I wasn't shattered or anything after I shot Gandu. “I was shooting lovemaking scenes with my co-actor that were being shot by my boyfriend. Now, how weird is that?\" You can probably understand at this point why the film may have been viewed as taboo. In India the flick didn’t get its first screening until July 2021 at the Osian Film Festival. But despite the many controversies that have followed the flick over the years, critics have received the film positively as Gandu boasts a decent score of 68 percent on review aggregator website [Rotten Tomatoes.](https://www.unilad.com/rotten-tomatoes) Topics: [Sex and Relationships](/sex-and-relationships), [Film and TV](/film-and-tv)",

    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Los Angeles, Jan 31 (IANS) Grammy winner Meghan Trainor, who has Riley and 18-month-old Barry with husband Daryl Sabara, recalled being warned that her career would come to an end if she had children because \"nobody really cares\" about mothers in the music industry.\nShe told People magazine:“Once they got pregnant, they were like, 'You're done.' I was told at 20 by an older gentleman in the industry, 'Well, she's a mom, so nobody really cares.' I was like, 'Ouch!'”\nHowever, the 'Dear Future Husband' hitmaker believes her career has gained \"a whole new life\" since having her sons.\nShe said:“When I became a mom, my career had a whole new life. I had a whole reboot, and it's because my kids made me want to be the best version of me. I'm not peaking. I've just begun.”\nShe took her children on the road when she toured last year and it was a great experience for the whole family, reports co.\nShe recalled:“I'd be fully glammed up, picking boogies, putting diapers on, putting them in their pyjamas before a show. My glitter would be leaking on them; I would peel eyelashes off them all the time, but they loved it.\n“Nobody misses it more than Riley. Every day he's like, 'Can we go back on tour?'”\nTrainor is thrilled with how her life has turned out, she admitted there is still one thing she is hoping for - \"some daughters\".\nShe said:“Where I am right now is far beyond anything I could have ever dreamed of. I always wanted a family. Check. Now I need some daughters. But I never thought I could be a pop star because I didn't believe in myself.\n\"Now 19-year-old Meghan putting out 'All About that Bass' is stoked; she's so proud, like, 'I didn't know you could do that.' It took 10 years to become brave, but I'm finally thriving.”\nThe 'All About That Bass'' singer doesn't worry about her sales figures or chart performance because all that matters is that her kids \"love\" her work.\nShe said: \"Priorities shifted [when I became a mom]. It's like, 'What charts? My kids love this.' At night when we're doing bath time, I'm like, 'Want to hear Mommy's new song?' Getting to talk to my older son now, I'll ask, 'What does Mommy do?' He's like, 'She's a pop star.' Like, yeah, Mommy's cool!”\nMENAFN30012025000231011071ID1109151296",
