    "text": "This November 15, a change in the privacy policies of artificial intelligence. The modification, which has not been communicated directly to users, coincides with the acceleration of X member registrations in Bluesky, a very similar operating network but based on a decentralized protocol.\nPODCAST | Elon Musk, story of the man without limits\n“If you continue to use our products or services after November 15, 2024, you will be accepting the updated terms of service and privacy policy,” the social network owned by Elon Musk notified in a blog post published in October.\nThe new chapter of the Privacy Policy called “third party collaborators” . “Depending on your settings, or if you choose to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties,” the modified text breaks down: “If you do not opt ​​out, in some cases recipients of the information may use it for their own purposes. independent, other than those set out in X’s privacy policy, including, for example, to train its artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.\nTo deactivate the sending of personal data collected by X to third companies for these purposes, it is necessary to deactivate this option from the app’s configuration panel. In the section “Privacy and security” There is a section called “Data Sharing and Personalization.” Within the latter, it is necessary to go to “ Data shared with business partners ” and deactivate the tab referring to special data transfers that can be derived from AI training.\nIt should be noted that this does not completely cancel the sending of any data to other companies, since “X always shares information with business partners so that its products work and can be improved,” as the social network explains in said section. Disabling the tab only affects “additional information” that can be used to feed the databases of generative algorithms.\nX is also using its users’ data to train its own AI, Grok, which is only available to paying members. However, it can also be disabled. The tab for this is also found in the “Privacy and security” section of the app, within the last section, called “Grok” .\nDespite frequently warning about the risks of AI, Elon Musk is one of the figures who has ventured the most into the business of virtual assistants based on this technology. She was on the founding team of OpenAI, developer of ChatGPT. After finding himself out of the company due to incompatibilities with his role at Tesla, he founded XAI, the creator of Grok.\nHis assistant wants to differentiate himself from the rest by making greater use of humor and sarcasm. As Musk explained, Grok is inspired by characters like Jarvis from iron man or Marvin from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and claims that it offers entertaining and “rebellious” answers.\nAll of these technologies are based on content uploaded by users to the Internet for years for training. On this occasion, the new policies have coincided with the transfer of users from X to Bluesky, whose business model avoids collecting personal data from users. This Thursday the platform, which in less than a year open to the general public has gained 16 million users, added a record of more than one million registrations in 24 hours.\nelDiario.es is now on Bluesky, you can follow us here\n#begins #selling #user #data #train #artificial #intelligence #flight #Bluesky",

    "title": "Sexual assault cases are formally removed from the U.S. military chain of command",
    "text": "A new system that will put independent lawyers in charge of the prosecution of sexual assault cases in the U.S. military took effect on Thursday, marking a significant change to the way the Department of Defense tries those accused of an offense. As a result of the change, sexual assault and other serious crimes will shift away from military commanders to legal organizations within each military service called the Offices of Special Trial Counsel. The reform comes after years of efforts by members of Congress and others to counter a troubling rise in sexual assaults within the armed forces. For fiscal year 2022, the Pentagon's Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military showed incidents rose 13% in the Navy, 9% in the Air Force and 3.6% in the Marine Corps. While incidents in the Army fell 9%, there were still 8,942 reports of sexual assault across the entire force. Last year, Congress passed legislation to strengthen protections for service members, and in July, President Biden approved the system that takes effect today. In a statement , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called the reform a \"landmark change to the U.S. military justice system.\" \"It is the most important reform to our military justice system since the creation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950,\" he said. \"This reform aims to help strengthen accountability and increase all of our service members' trust in the fairness and integrity of the military justice system.\" The offices will be staffed by special trial counsel which will also have the authority to prosecute over a dozen other charges including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence, stalking, child pornography and most sexual misconduct within the military. The change aims to ensure decisions are not influenced by the inherent conflicts of interest and political pressures faced by commanders tasked with prosecuting members of their unit. But Rachel VanLandingham, the president emerita of the National Institute of Military Justice , said it remains to be seen whether the change will be effective. \"While the military lawyers are 'independent' in the sense that they no longer are part of the accused or victim's chain of command, instead working for civilian service secretaries, the entire military justice structure is one that lacks independence and impartiality and disserves service members,\" she said. The special trial counsels will now handle over a dozen crimes, but VanLandingham said the majority of offenses in the military code, including disobedience, dereliction of duty and insubordination, will also still be handled by those in the chain of command who have lost confidence to handle cases such as those dealing with sexual assault. \"The change, while in the right direction, establishes a two-track justice system depending on the alleged offenses, and thus creates due process concerns,\" VanLandingham said. Josh Connolly, a member of the board of directors of Protect Our Defenders, viewed the reform as a step forward, but said it would require truly impartial lawyers to achieve change. \"All this depends on how this is implemented,\" he said. \"If you don't have the right personnel in these divisions and they have bias then this is all for naught.\"",
