    "title": "Diaspora Minister: Harvard University a Synonym for Antisemitism",
    "text": " 10:17 AM EST Harvard University has become synonymous with antisemitism, and with a total moral collapse of core basic academic values that is spreading like wildfire on American campuses, Israel’s minister for Diaspora affairs said Thursday. The remarks come as the Ivy League school faces a donor revolt following the evasive congressional testimony of Harvard President Claudine Gay regarding student protesters' calls for the genocide of Jews, and the university board’s subsequent refusal to oust her. Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli said that all three university presidents who testified on Capitol Hill should have been forced to resign, even before their bitterly criticized congressional testimony, due to their failure to speak out against the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas. “Universities that were unable to issue an unequivocal condemnation of Oct. 7 are in a colossal crisis from a moral point of view,” Chikli said in an interview with JNS. “Moral relativism has created a moral abyss. Truth has become a relative term.” He advocated increased pressure “by all means” on academic institutions that tolerate antisemitism, adding that the strong backlash across the political spectrum against the presidents' testimony created an opportunity for change, and showcased the massive foreign funding of American universities by Qatar, which many Americans were unaware of. While the president of the University of Pennsylvania has stepped down from her position following her testimony, the heads of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology remain in their jobs, having apologized for their remarks. Chikli lamented the slide to “academic amateurism,” which, he said, was spurred by “a post-modernist progressive mindset, where equality and political correctness have overtaken merit, quality, and basic truths.” Greater Jewish Identity Amid Assaults In the interview, the Diaspora affairs minister noted that the antisemitism that has burst out into the open on American campuses since the start of the war against Hamas has led to a concomitant increase in Jewish identity. “We are witness to a dynamic in which anti-Jewish hate is leading to an increase in Jewish identity,” he said, citing a slogan that read: “The more you hate us, the Jew-isher we get.” The ministry is set to co-fund a $8 million campaign on campuses with pro-Israel partner organizations for Israel advocacy and is also working with the governments of Belgium, Denmark, and Italy against antisemitic activity. Chikli noted that many of the anti-Israel demonstrators shouting: “From the River to the Sea” have “zero knowledge” of the situation on the ground or the reality in the Middle East. This could give educated pro-Israel students an opening to influence people with their knowledge. Qatar Funding The wave of anti-Israel demonstrations, which have taken place at campuses across the U.S., including some with openly jihadist rhetoric, has exposed the vast amount of foreign funding flowing into American universities, with Qatar reportedly the single largest donor of any country, pumping in billions of dollars. Chikli argued that Israel should boycott Qatar, home to Hamas leaders who live there in opulence. He is pushing for a boycott, despite Qatar’s role as an intermediary in getting more than 100 Israeli hostages abducted to Gaza released last month in exchange for 240 Palestinian security prisoners. “It is because of Qatar’s support of Hamas that the hostages were taken to begin with,” he said. “I have zero faith in them.” Republished with permission from Jewish News Syndicate. - ",

    "text": "Detenuto morto a Oristano, la Procura autorizza l’autopsia\n(ANSA) – ORISTANO, 28 DIC – Sarà eseguita l’autopsia sul corpo di Stefano Dal Corso, il detenuto romano di 42 anni trovato morto il 12 ottobre del 2022 in una cella del carcere di Massama, alle porte di Oristano. In un primo tempo il caso era stato chiuso come un suicidio per impiccagione, ma è stato riaperto a settembre grazie alle rivelazioni della moglie di un detenuto raccolte da Marisa Dal Corso, sorella della vittima.\nLa novità annunciata nel tardo pomeriggio in una conferenza stampa a Roma convocata dalla famiglia e dall’avvocata che la assiste, Armida Decina, è che ora la Procura indaga per omicidio volontario al momento contro ignoti. “Ce l’abbiamo fatta, ci hanno detto sì all’autopsia – commenta con l’ANSA la sorella Marisa – Speriamo adesso che si arrivi alla verità sulla morte di Stefano, quella che abbiamo sempre sostenuto, e cioè che è stato ucciso. In questo modo potremmo chiudere finalmente questa terribile vicenda”.\nPer ben sette volte l’avvocata Decina aveva chiesto, senza successo, che si svolgesse l’esame sul corpo di Stefano. Adesso la procura di Oristano ha deciso per gli accertamenti necroscopici e il prossimo 4 gennaio affiderà l’incarico al medico legale Roberto Demontis. L’autopsia sarà eseguita a Roma dove si trova attualmentela salma. La famiglia avrà i suoi consulenti: il medico legale Claudio Buccelli, l’ematologa forense Gelsomina Mansueto e l’esperto tossicologico Ciro di Nuzio.\nLa svolta è arrivata nelle ultime settimane con le rivelazioni di supertestimone, raccolte anche queste da Marisa Dal Corso e depositate in procura. Si tratta di un agente della polizia penitenziaria secondo il quale Stefano è stato ucciso perché aveva sorpreso due agenti durante un rapporto sessuale. Il detenuto sarebbero quindi stato portato in una cella e ucciso a manganellate, poi colpito con una spranga per provocare la rottura dell’osso del collo e simulare il suicidio. (ANSA).",

    "text": "WooSox' Bats Held Dormant in 4-2 Loss to Toledo\nAugust 29, 2024 -\nInternational League (IL) Worcester Red Sox News Release\nWORCESTER, MA -- Jason Alexander was solid over five innings, but the Worcester Red Sox (30-23)/(65-63) dropped the third game of their six-game set to the Toledo Mud Hens (25-29)/(60-68) by a final score of 4-2. With Columbus' 5-2 win over Gwinnett, the WooSox fell to six games back with 22 games to play.\nThursday night was a classic pitcher's duel between the WooSox and Mud Hens.\nJason Alexander got the start for Worcester and was excellent in five innings of work. The right-hander retired the side in order twice and finished with a line of 5 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 1 BB, 6 K--with the lone mistake coming in the second inning. Ahead in the count 0-2, Alexander left a slider up in the zone and Eddys Leonard deposited it onto the berm in left to give the Mud Hens a 1-0 lead.\nToledo's starting pitcher, Lael Lockhart, was equally impressive, hurling five shutout innings for the Mud Hens. With Worcester averaging 6.1 runs per game in their last 18 contests, Lockhart held the WooSox' high-powered offense to just two hits over the course of his outing.\nOver the same 18-game span, Worcester's bullpen has been equally as dominant as the offense, pitching to a 2.72 ERA with 10.1 K/9 in their last 76.1 innings. The first two relievers-- Cam Booser and Bailey Horn--continued the WooSox' 'pen's stretch of excellence on Thursday night, preventing Toledo from adding on in the sixth and seventh innings.\nBooser was first out of the bullpen for the WooSox and allowed one hit while striking out the side. The southpaw began a rehab assignment with Worcester on Thursday after being placed on the 15-Day Injured List by the Red Sox on August 14 with left elbow inflammation. Horn followed with two strikeouts of his own in a perfect seventh inning.\nIn the WooSox half of the seventh, the offense finally woke up.\nWith one out, Worcester loaded the bases for Enmanuel Valdez, who worked a walk to tie up the game at one. Vaughn Grissom followed by lining a 2-1 fastball to left for a sacrifice fly to give the WooSox a 2-1 lead.\nTo begin the eighth inning, Worcester went to their third lefty of the night in Zach Penrod who walked two of the first three batters he faced. After a groundout put men on second and third with two outs, Penrod was relieved by Yohan Ramirez who looked to get the WooSox out of the inning. But the right-hander left a sweeper up in the zone that Andrew Navigato pulled onto the berm for a three-run go-ahead home run to put Toledo ahead, 4-2.\nWith six outs remaining, the WooSox offense went down quietly, striking out four times while only managing one baserunner. It was only their fourth loss in their last 19 games, but a crucial defeat as Worcester continues to chase the Columbus Clippers for the International League second half title.\nZach Penrod (L, 3-2) was handed his second loss of the year while Devin Sweet (W, 8-6) earned the victory for Toledo.\nThe WooSox and Mud Hens will continue their six-game series at 6:45 p.m. on Friday night at Polar Park. Hunter Dobbins will make his Triple-A debut after he was promoted to Worcester on August 22. Toledo will send Bryan Sammons (6-5, 4.18) opposite Dobbins.The game will be broadcasted live on NESN+ and radio coverage begins at 6:25 p.m. on 98.9 Nash Icon and the WooSox Radio Network.\nBOX SCORE - TOL 4, WOR 2\nWorcester Red Sox Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the\nInternational League message board...\nInternational League Stories from August 29, 2024\nRain Rests Redbirds' Rout of Rivals- Memphis Redbirds Knights Drop Thursday's Game to Sounds, 5-1- Charlotte Knights WooSox' Bats Held Dormant in 4-2 Loss to Toledo- Worcester Red Sox White, Collins Help Sounds Conquer Knights- Nashville Sounds Syracuse Pummels Lehigh Valley, 13-6, on Thursday Night- Syracuse Mets Kody Clemens Goes Deep as IronPigs Drop Second Straight to Mets- Lehigh Valley IronPigs Hens Rally Late to Claim 4-2 Victory Over Red Sox at Polar Park- Toledo Mud Hens Seymour Leads Durham to Fourth Straight- Durham Bulls Red Wings, RailRiders Postponed Thursday Night- Rochester Red Wings RailRiders and Red Wings Game Postponed- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders August 29th Omaha Storm Chasers Game Postponed- Omaha Storm Chasers Saints and Storm Chasers Rained Out, Doubleheader Friday- St. Paul Saints August 29 Game Notes: Iowa Cubs vs. Memphis Redbirds- Iowa Cubs Trivino Scheduled to Rehab with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders Nastrini Promoted to White Sox on Thursday- Charlotte Knights SWB Game Notes - August 29- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders Rochester Red Wings Game Notes - August 29 at Scranton/WB- Rochester Red Wings Kornberg to Broadcast Seven Additional Marlins Regular Season Games- Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp Sounds Host Braves, Cardinals Affiliates in Final Homestand of Season- Nashville Sounds Storm Chasers Drop Second Straight to St. Paul- Omaha Storm Chasers Late Offensive Charge Fizzles Out in 7-6 Loss to Columbus- Gwinnett Stripers\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.\nOther Recent Worcester Red Sox Stories\nWooSox' Bats Held Dormant in 4-2 Loss to Toledo Grissom Drives in Three as WooSox Win 5-4 Over Toledo With 24 Games Remaining, WooSox Are Making a Late Push for the Postseason WooSox Score a Dozen, Win 12-2 Over Toledo in Series Opener WooSox Dismantle Tides in Series Finale, Win 13-0",
