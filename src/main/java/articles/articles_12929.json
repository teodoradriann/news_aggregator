    "title": "I changed my iPad Pro's wallpaper and now full screen apps (particularly games) are entirely unusable and crash and restart my device",
    "text": "Hi. I am having a major device-breaking issue with my iPad Pro which is rendering me unable to use certain applications that I commonly use on my device. Every time I load certain full screen applications, my iPad Pro crashes and restarts after a period of time, typically a few seconds to a few minutes.\nDevice: iPad Pro, 11-inch, 2nd generation, 128GB & Wi-Fi only model ( iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation) - Technical Specifications - Apple Support )\niPad OS Version: 17.6.1\nSteps I did that led up to this issue:\nI recently updated from an older version of iPadOS to version 17. After updating my device, I noticed that loading & using many full screen applications for a period of time would cause my device's wallpaper to disappear and turn black on both the home screen and lock screen. Restarting my device would restore my wallpaper. This issue most commonly occurred with full screen apps like games, such as Genshin Impact or Honkai: Star Rail, but I've also had this issue with art applications like Procreate. I decided to change my device's wallpaper to see if it would fix the issue of my wallpaper disappearing. This seems to have made the issue worse. Now when I load those same full screen applications that previously caused my wallpaper to disappear after a period of time, my device instead crashes and restarts after a short period of time, typically a few seconds to a few minutes.\nNotes:\nReducing the graphics settings in Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact from High to Low seems to reduce the frequency of my device crashing and restarting. As said though, it doesn't fix the issue, simply reduces its frequency. I don't know for sure if the wallpaper issue is related or entirely a coincidence, but I find it weird that the initial strange behaviour with full screen apps messed with my device's wallpaper and then the crashes began the moment I changed my device's wallpaper.\nThis issue has rendered me entirely unable to use most full screen applications on my device and has effectively rendered my iPad unusable to me as I originally bought this device with doing both professional art production and being able to play mobile games in mind. I can't do either if my device crashes repeatedly when I try to do said tasks on it.\nAny help would be extremely appreciated.",

    "text": "A notícia esta a ser avançada esta quinta-feira pela Reuters , que escreve que Trump estava há dois anos em funções como Presidente dos Estados Unidos quando autorizou esta operação secreta da CIA.\nSegundo ex-oficiais com conhecimento direto desta operação, o objetivo era usar as redes sociais para influenciar a opinião pública chinesa contra o seu governo de Xi Jinping.\nEsta operação foi realizada por uma pequena equipa de operacionais que usaram identidades falsas para espalhar narrativas nas redes sociais chinesas contra o governo de Xi Jinping. Ao mesmo tempo, divulgavam informações depreciativas a meios de comunicação social estrangeiros.\nA operação teve início em 2019 e não tinha sido do conhecimento público até hoje.\nA equipa da CIA responsável por esta operação promoveu alegações de que membros do Partido Comunista chinês em funções esconderam dinheiro ilícito no estrangeiro, além de criticarem duramente a iniciativa chinesa Rota da Seda, que visa aumentar a influência da China através do financiamento de infra-estruturas pelo mundo, sobretudo nos países em desenvolvimento.\nAs autoridades norte-americanas recusaram fornecer detalhes, mas garantem que as informações depreciativas veiculadas eram baseadas em factos. Não são claras as consequências desta operação secreta conduzida em 2019 e a porta-voz de Biden no Conselho Nacional de Segurança, Kate Waters, recusou esclarecer se o programa ainda se mantém ativo.\nPorque o seu tempo é precioso.

    "text": "Yahoo News Trump trial updates: David Pecker testifies about election-year hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal David Knowles · Senior Editor Updated April 26, 2024 at 12:57 AM · 4 min read 7.9k Former President Donald Trump. (Mark Peterson/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\nOops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nThe former publisher of the National Enquirer told a jury about negotiations in 2016 with two women looking to sell their stories about alleged sexual relationships with then presidential candidate Donald Trump . This is Yahoo News' succinct update on the criminal and civil cases against Trump. Here are the latest developments.\n🚨 What happened today Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker resumed his testimony Thursday in Trump’s trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He detailed hush money payment negotiations with adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both of whom sought to sell their stories alleging an extramarital affair with Trump. During questioning by prosecutors, Pecker said he had sought to promote Trump’s candidacy in 2016 despite knowing that such an arrangement violated campaign finance laws. During cross-examination, Trump’s lawyers portrayed those efforts as “standard operating procedure.”\n📌 Tell me more Payment to McDougal: Pecker testified about the $150,000 contract McDougal signed with the Enquirer for the exclusive rights to her story about a sexual affair with Trump. The contract, which was signed three months before the 2016 presidential election, stemmed from the deal Pecker reached with Trump in 2015 to promote his presidential candidacy. Pecker testified that he knew the deal was illegal, made it anyway in order to protect Trump and later lied about doing so. Pecker described asking Trump lawyer Michael Cohen who would pay the contract fee to McDougal. He said Cohen responded, “The boss will take care of it,” in reference to Trump. Later, however, he said Cohen told him that the magazine should pay. Pecker said the Enquirer disguised the payment as a fee for McDougal’s services to the magazine to avoid breaking campaign finance laws. During a 2017 meeting with Trump, Pecker said, the president-elect asked him, “How’s our girl doing?” He then thanked him for “handling the McDougal situation.” During a second meeting at the White House in July 2017, Trump asked, “How is Karen doing?” Pecker testified.\nPayment to Daniels: Pecker testified that after he had already paid McDougal $150,000 and former Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin $30,000 to bury a later debunked story about Trump fathering a child out of wedlock, he refused to pay Daniels $120,000 in October of 2016 for the exclusive rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump. He said he told Cohen that he should pay her if he wanted to keep it from going public. “I am not going to be involved with a porn star,” Pecker said he told Cohen, adding that if Cohen didn’t pay Daniels to keep quiet and the story was published elsewhere, “I believe the boss is going to be very angry with you.” Cohen ended up paying Daniels $130,000 for her silence, and she signed a nondisclosure agreement. After Daniels gave an interview on CNN, Trump told Pecker that she had violated the agreement and owed him $24 million, Pecker testified. Prosecutors allege that the payments to McDougal and Daniels were made as part of a conspiracy to promote Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and were in violation of campaign finance laws. In 2018, the Federal Election Commission sent letters to Cohen and Pecker asking for information. “We committed a campaign violation,” Pecker said he told Cohen, who reportedly responded, “Jeff Sessions is the attorney general and Donald Trump has him in his pocket.” After leaving the National Enquirer’s parent company, Pecker signed a cooperation agreement with the Manhattan district attorney’s office that spares him from being prosecuted in this case.\nCross-examination of Pecker: Defense lawyer Emil Bove sought to show that the National Enquirer’s deal with Trump to purchase and bury negative stories was “standard operating procedure” for a tabloid newspaper. Pecker testified that the Enquirer had also suppressed stories for former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor Mark Wahlberg and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. He told the jury that he had informed Trump about negative stories prior to Trump’s decision to run for president in 2016, and that another reason the Enquirer refrained from publishing negative stories about Trump was that doing so was good for business.\nMeanwhile: As Trump listened to Pecker’s testimony, Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll’s civil trial against Trump, denied a motion to overturn the $83.3 million judgment in that case and grant him a new trial. In Washington, Trump’s lawyers argued before the Supreme Court that presidential immunity protects him from being prosecuted for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n🗓 What’s next? Trump’s lawyers will continue their cross-examination of Pecker on Friday. Court will resume at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n📖 The background ⚖️ Trump’s trials and legal cases View comments",

    "text": "腾讯视频会员数遭遇明显下滑。\n　　8月13日，腾讯披露业绩。财报显示，在2025年第二季度，腾讯营收同比增长15%至1845.04亿元；归母净利润同比增长17%至556.28亿元。美东时间周三，腾讯控股ADR涨超7%，创下逾四年以来的新高。\n　　不过，腾讯视频拖了腾讯整体业绩的后腿。财报显示，截至二季度末，腾讯视频视频付费会员数为1.14亿，同比、环比均下滑了300万。\n　　需要注意的是，在目前市场环境下，腾讯视频广告增长有着明显压力。\n　　比如，在今年一季度，爱奇艺广告收入就同比下滑10.4%到13.3亿元。在2024年， 芒果超媒 （ 300413 ）广告收入同比下滑2.7%至34.38亿元。理论上，爱奇艺在广告上与腾讯视频在同一梯队。\n　　背后是，短视频强势崛起抢夺了长视频的流量与广告客户。\n　　比如，据《中国网络视听发展研究报告(2025)》，截至2024年12月，我国短视频用户规模达到10.40亿，使用率达93.8%，连续6年保持网络视听应用细分领域第一。\n　　另外，从变现上，短视频也更有效率且变现路径清晰。“线上营销主要投抖音与小红书，不准备投长视频。”有正在迅速扩张的新消费品牌高管表态。\n　　爱奇艺创始人龚宇就对外透露，长视频的观众正在流失，特别是最近两三年非常严重。一个案例是，爱奇艺已不公布付费会员具体数量。\n　　由此，腾讯视频也在改变。\n　　今年6月，腾讯公司副总裁、腾讯在线视频董事长孙忠怀就对外表示，长视频行业面临的两大变量，一个是竖屏剧后续如何与长视频平台共舞，一个是AI会怎样改变内容生产和消费。\n　　他披露，在竖屏短剧方面，从2024年底起步，腾讯视频稳健开局，已上线竖屏短剧超20000部，自制竖屏短剧的声量已经攀升至30亿，收获全网热搜87个。\n　　但从腾讯视频下滑的会员数来看，孙忠怀的改变还需加速。\n　　 SFC",

    "text": "Emiliano Aguilar, el hijo mayor de Pepe Aguilar, le reclamó a su papá al no ser invitado a la boda de Ángela y Christian Nodal que se llevó a cabo el pasado 24 julio. El primogénito del cantante le escribió \"GPI\" (gracias por invitar), luego de que el patriarca de la dinastía Aguilar compartiera unas imágenes del evento. El joven explicó de forma contundente por qué le dejó este mensaje a su papá, con quien aparentemente estaría distanciado.
