    "text": "Ligand Pharma's at-home skin treatment gets FDA approval January 05, 2024 at 10:15 pm Share Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ligand Pharmaceuticals' topical treatment for a viral skin infection has received approval from the U.S. health regulator, the company said on Friday, marking the first-ever at-home approved treatment for the condition in the country.\nThe gel, Zelsuvmi, is expected to be available in the U.S. in the second half of 2024.\nThe pricing has not yet been established, a company spokesperson said in an email.\nLigand's shares were up about 5% in extended trading.\nZelsuvmi will treat a type of highly contagious skin infection called molluscum contagiosum. It is caused by a poxvirus and results in skin lesions that usually resolve within a year without scarring, but can take a lot longer in some cases.\nThe drug will compete with Verrica Pharmaceuticals' Ycanth, which last year became the first U.S.-approved treatment for the infection, but requires medical supervision during application.

    "text": "Read full article HuffPost Ariana Grande Shares Which 'Sex And The City' Star Makes An Appearance In 'Wicked' CorEy Townsend January 24, 2025 at 12:31 a.m. · 2 min read\nLink Copied\nAriana Grande Shares Which 'Sex And The City' Star Makes An Appearance In 'Wicked' Could Hollywood really be “Wicked” enough for a “Sex and the City” alum? Apparently, the answer is yes.\nAriana Grande jokingly revealed that the “concrete jungle,” and the mythical land of “OZ” collided in the digital release of her record-breaking film , which she filmed with co-star Cynthia Erivo.\nAriana Grande and Cynthia Erivo attend the \"Wicked: Part One\" European Premiere at The Royal Festival Hall on Nov. 18, 2024, in London, England. Neil Mockford via Getty Images While speaking with Variety , Grande teased a hidden gem in the digital release of the film — a bonus feature that includes David Eigenberg in an uncredited role. Eigenberg appeared in the popular “Sex and the City” series from 1998-2004, and later reprised his role in the MAX follow-up “And Just Like That…” as Miranda’s love interest, who was played by Cynthia Nixon. This time, however, Eigenberg voices the Tamarin Monkey in “Wicked,” delivering what Grande calls “the best line in the whole thing”: “A solicitor was sacked just for arguing a case.”\nADVERTISEMENT “So that I guess is Steve from ‘Sex and the City,’” Grande joked. “He makes a cameo. He has one line, and it’s the best line in the whole thing, the little Tamarin Monkey.”\nCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande pose at the Ozdust Ball \"Wicked\" New York City Premiere at the Museum of Modern Art on Nov. 14, 2024. Bruce Glikas via Getty Images Grande also gave readers a behind-the-scenes look on her journey to OZ. In the interview, the singer made it a point to keep some of “Glinda’s” iconic lines from the Broadway play. In an effort to preserve her love for the role, one of the lines she sought to keep was, “Perhaps you remember my essay? ‘Magic Wands: Need They Have a Point?’”\n“I felt it was my duty to protect those little moments for her,” she said.\nGrande and Erivo are both up for Academy Awards , with Erivo being on track to potentially becoming the youngest recipient of an EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony).\nRelated...",

Smith was shot near the vehicle, leaving blood on the front passenger seat and outside the car, police said.\nPolice on Wednesday charged Kimbrough with homicide and carrying a firearm without a license. A judge Thursday denied him bail.\nAbout two hours after the shooting, Kimbrough approached two Pittsburgh police officers at the crime scene and told them he lived nearby, police said. Kimbrough said that he was working out and playing football at the time of the shooting, according to the complaint.\nPolice didn’t mention a motive for the shooting in the complaint.\nKimbrough’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 8. His attorney was not listed.",

    "title": "Museveni Encourages Ugandans to Emulate Julius Nyerere's Devotion to Nation and Faith",
    "text": "On Friday, Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni met with Mama Maria Nyerere, widow of the late Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, at State Lodge Nakasero. During their meeting, President Museveni praised Mama Maria for her dedication to praying for the canonization of her late husband through the Uganda Martyrs.\nPresident Museveni emphasized the importance of Julius Nyerere's commitment to both his country and his\nfaith, urging Ugandans to follow his example. He highlighted the significance of Nyerere's vision for African integration, which continues to inspire many across the continent.\n\"Our mother Mama Maria Nyerere, you are most welcome. I'm very happy that you thought of this idea of praying through the Martyrs of Uganda to pray for the canonization of our father Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, and it has brought us together,\" said President Museveni.\nWhy this matters: The call to emulate Julius Nyerere's commitment to country and religion has significant implications for national unity and development in Uganda and beyond. If successful, it could inspire a new generation of leaders to prioritize the well-being of their citizens and promote regional integration.\nMama Maria Nyerere has been attending the Nyerere Beatification Prayer Day at Namugongo Catholic Shrine every June 1st, ahead of the Uganda Martyrs Day celebrations on June 3rd. This annual event draws people from various parts of\nAfrica, reflecting Nyerere's enduring legacy.\nPope Benedict XVI declared Julius Nyerere a\nservant of God on May 13, 2005, marking the first step towards his beatification and potential canonization as a saint. Since 2009, the faithful have gathered at Namugongo to pray for Nyerere's beatification ahead of the Martyrs Day celebrations.\nJulius Nyerere, who served as Tanzania's prime minister from 1961 to 1964 and president from 1964 to 1985, was a key figure in Tanzania's history. He founded the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) in 1954 and led Tanganyika to independence in 1961. In 1964, Tanganyika merged with Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanzania.\nNyerere's leadership was marked by his dedication to socialism and Pan-Africanism, formalized in the Arusha Declaration of 1967. His policies aimed at promoting unity and political stability in Tanzania, which remains relatively free of ethnic divisions despite its cultural diversity.\n\"Each year when you come, you see how many people who turn up from all parts of Africa, and that was my vision. So, we who are still alive, led by you, we are still pushing the vision in different ways. This is another way of looking at\nAfrican integration,\" Museveni remarked.\nOn behalf of Mama Maria, Sr. Elidina Michael Ntandu expressed appreciation to President Museveni for his support in the cause of Nyerere's beatification. \"We thank you for always supporting Mama Nyerere in the cause of the beatification of Mwalimu Nyerere. We thank you for all that you have done for us. We pray that God gives you all that you pray for,\" she said.\nAs Ugandans reflect on President Museveni's call, the legacy of Julius Nyerere illustrates the profound impact a dedicated leader can have on their nation and beyond. His commitment to unity, faith, and African integration continues to inspire future generations.\nKey Takeaways\n- Ugandan President Museveni meets with Mama Maria Nyerere to discuss her husband's canonization.\n- Museveni praises Julius Nyerere's commitment to country and faith, urging Ugandans to follow his example.\n- Nyerere's vision for African integration continues to inspire many across the continent.\n- Pope Benedict XVI declared Nyerere a \"servant of God\" in 2005, a step towards beatification and canonization.\n- Nyerere's legacy promotes unity, faith, and African integration, inspiring future generations.",

    "text": "Gandia Blasco: un aire fresco ante la homogeneidad con sus colecciones de inspiración mediterránea\nGandia Blasco, renombrada marca de mobiliario exterior, ha lanzado su innovadora colección ‘Onde’, diseñada por Luca Nichetto. Esta nueva propuesta redefine la relación entre los espacios interiores y exteriores, llevando la fusión de ambos conceptos a un nuevo nivel.\nLa nueva colección hace revivir a la estética de los años cincuenta para aquellos ambientes que optan por no definir los límites.\nDesde los años noventa, la marca se ha inspirado en la arquitectura mediterránea y moderna, caracterizada principalmente por la integración fluida entre espacios interiores y exteriores. Por ejemplo, las casas blancas mediterráneas, con sus límites desdibujados, sirven de modelo para trazar un estilo de vida en constante conexión con el exterior, donde los porches y terrazas se convierten en lugares esenciales del hogar.\nEn este sentido, la nueva colección ‘Onde’, junto con otras como ‘Onsen’, ‘Erno’ y ‘Mass’, simbolizan un avance significativo hacia la eliminación de las fronteras tradicionales en el mundo del mobiliario. Además, el nuevo lanzamiento integra grandes sugerencias que provienen de la estética de los años cincuenta, aunque logra adaptarse perfectamente a espacios indefinidos, es decir, a aquellos ambientes que no son estrictamente interiores ni exteriores. Por otro lado, la colección ‘Onsen’, diseñada por Francesco Meda y David Quincoces, mezcla estructuras de acero inoxidable con materiales que evocan la calidez del cuero clásico, mientras que ‘Erno’ y ‘Mass’ ofrecen volúmenes tapizados con texturas cálidas y resistentes para uso al aire libre, sin perder elegancia.\nComposición de la colección 'Erno', de Gandia Blasco.\nParalelamente, la firma también ha revisitado sus raíces textiles, impulsando diseños innovadores que promueven nuevas formas de habitar y proyectar espacios. La marca, que comenzó en 1941 como fabricante de mantas, ha evolucionado hasta convertirse en un referente internacional en diseño de mobiliario exterior, con presencia en más de 75 países y colaboraciones con reconocidos diseñadores y arquitectos.\nEn definitiva, la filosofía de\nGandia Blasco es clara: crear espacios contemporáneos, elegantes y funcionales que reflejen su pasión por la vida al aire libre. Con su sede histórica en Ontinyent (Valencia) y locales destacados en ciudades como Nueva York, Madrid, Barcelona y Lisboa, la compañía sigue expandiéndose y marcando tendencias en el mundo del diseño. Desde su fundación en 1941, la empresa ha destacado por su capacidad de reinvención y su compromiso con el diseño. Con José A. Gandía-Blasco Canales, la compañía ha logrado escalar posiciones hasta alcanzar el reconocimiento internacional por la alta calidad de sus productos y su capacidad para crear ambientes exteriores que reflejan un estilo de vida mediterráneo.\nDesde la tradición textil al diseño de vanguardia, Gandia Blasco es garantía de compromiso y reinvención.",

    "text": "Read full article Reuters Moldovan prosecutors mull charges against general accused of spying for Russia Alexander Tanas June 7, 2024 at 1:02 a.m. · 2 min read Link Copied\nBy Alexander Tanas\nCHISINAU (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Moldova were awaiting additional information from the ex-Soviet state's intelligence services to determine whether to charge a general alleged to have passed sensitive information to Russia, U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe reported on Thursday.\nIgor Gorgan, former chief of staff of Moldova's armed forces, is to be stripped of his rank of general as well as of state honours, pro-European President Maia Sandu's chief of staff said on Wednesday.\nAdrian Balutal's announcement followed publication in a Russian investigative journal, The Insider, of allegations that Gorgan from 2022 passed sensitive information on both Moldova and neighbouring Ukraine to Russian intelligence services.\nRadio Free Europe, quoting two security sources, said prosecutors were waiting for details from Moldova's SIB security service \"following which prosecutors will decide whether to open a case under Article 337 of the criminal code on treason\".\nMoldova's relations with Moscow have deteriorated, with Sandu denouncing the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine and singling out Russia and corruption as the biggest threats facing the country. Russia accuses Sandu of fomenting Russophobia.\nGorgan was also suspended on Wednesday from his current position as head of security at the Chisinau office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the office's press secretary said. The office said it viewed \"the grave allegations ... very seriously\".\nMoldova, with its population of 2.5 million, has welcomed since 2022 more than a million Ukrainian refugees, the highest per capita number of any country. Some 100,000 remain in the country,\nGorgan, dismissed by Sandu as chief of staff in 2021, was a graduate of a Soviet-era military school. He had earned two top state honours - for Military Services in 2006 and for Faith in the Fatherland in 2015.\nFormer Defence Minister Anatolie Salaru told Moldovan televsion that it was \"abundantly clear that Gorgan is a traitor. He passed on very important information to the Russian special services. Russia uses traitors to destabilise Moldova.\"\n(Reporting by Alexander Tanas, Editing by Ron Popeski and Marguerita Choy)",

    "text": "Lana Kelly got her first skin cancer diagnosis at 16 READ MORE: This fake tan doesn't stain your clothes or sheets after you put it on\nA woman who has had more than 100 dangerous sun spots cut out of her skin is issuing a warning to Aussies about protecting their complexions under strong UV rays.\nLana Kelly, from Brisbane, got her first skin cancer diagnosis when she was just 16 after growing up on the Sunshine Coast with a lax approach to sun protection.\nSince she had the cancer removed, the now-39-year-old has been hyper-vigilant when it comes to her skin and has regular checkups where almost every time something needs to be biopsied.\nLana told FEMAIL she has had over 100 moles, spots, carcinomas and early-stage melanomas surgically removed despite staying out of the sun and always wearing sunscreen.\nHer cautious attitude to the sun coupled with her desire for golden skin saw her become a fake tanning addict which sparked a business idea. Lana launched a line of haircare products, Auriche, specifically for self tanners in December.\nLana Kelly, from Brisbane, got her first skin cancer diagnosis when she was just 16 after growing up on the Sunshine Coast with a lax approach to sun protection\nSince her first skin cancer diagnosis, she has had more than 100 moles, spots carcinomas and early-stage melanomas surgically removed\nLara has her first skin cancer scare when she was 16 after she got two spots that had changed in appearance on her face checked out by her GP.\nThe spots were found to be cancerous and she had them removed leaving a ‘Harry Potter’ scar on her right cheek.\n‘When it’s cancerous they need to take quite a bit of tissue, it’s not just a simple cut,’ she said.\n‘That was a pretty scary experience being so young and having to have that kind of surgery. It was very sobering.’\nThankfully, skin cancers caught early enough can be removed surgically and there is no need for further treatment.\nLana’s brush with skin cancer saw her become extra cautious when protecting herself from the sun but she wasn’t out of danger.\n‘Since that age, I’ve been going to the dermatologist definitely at least once a year but sometimes on three month cycle,’ she said.\n‘I don’t even know how many spots but I would have had probably a hundred cut off for biopsies and there were different types of cancer in (a number) of them.’\nThe now-39-year-old has been hyper vigilant when it comes to her skin and has regular check ups where almost every time something needs to be biopsied to check for cancer\nEven though Lana has been to a dermatologist more times than she can count, she said waiting for biopsy results to determine if a suspicious spot was cancerous has never gotten easier.\n‘It’s nerve wracking each time. I think you don’t realise the stress until you get the text message saying it’s all fine or even to come back, at least you know,’ she said.\n‘I’ve only had one very early stage melanoma but all of the other ones would have been problematic if I weren’t on top of them.’\nLana has become an expert in identifying when a freckle or mole has the potential to turn cancerous.\nShe said it’s important to monitor moles and spots for any change in appearance or colour or if one becomes red, itchy or looks irregular.\n‘Sometimes it’s just a weird feeling. Two weeks ago I had one cut off my collar bone. It looked stable, it hadn’t changed or anything but I kept finding myself drawn to and concerned about it,’ she said.\nLana has become an expert in identifying is a spot has the potential to turn cancerous. She said to monitor any change in appearance or colour or if a spot becomes red or itchy\n‘I went to see my dermatologist and in fact it was skin cancer. Over many years I’ve become very aware of where my spots are and really keep an eye on them and take notice when things might feel off.’\nThe risk of skin cancer has plagued Lana’s immediate family, not because of genetics, but a lack of education around sun protection when she was a child.\nLana’s four sisters have had similar issues with two going through skin cancer treatments.\nTheir dad has also undergone chemotherapy, radiation and had a portion of his skull removed when a dangerous melanoma spread.\n‘I’m always wearing hats and sunscreen and all of those sorts of things. Unfortunately for me though, the damage was done and locked in from a young age so it’s been years of seeing it manifest,’ Lana said.\nShe and her sisters spent hours at the beach and in the sun as kids as their dad was a professional surfer but preventing sun burns was always an after thought.\n‘My parents were not super vigilant when it came to sun protection. They were quite young and the education around sun protection was not what it is today,’ she said.\n‘We would be fairly regularly sunburnt before the age of seven. The damage done before the age of seven is really critical. It really sticks with you.’\nLana’s four sisters (pictured L-R: Lana, Nicolette Maxwell, Danika Maxwell and Talia O’Sullivan) have had similar issues with two going through skin cancer treatments\nLana and her sisters spent hours at the beach and in the sun as kids as their dad was a professional surfer but preventing sun burns was always an after thought\nUV damage that happens during childhood has been strongly linked to an increased risk of skin cancer later in life according to Better Health.\nAs a result, Lana is always covered in sunscreen regardless of the weather and makes sure not to expose her skin to the sun if she can help it.\nHer favourite go-to sunscreen is La Roche-Posay SPF 50 which she reapplies every two hours.\n‘It’s super light. I use that everywhere because it’s the kind of sunscreen where you don’t feel like you’re wearing anything. It’s in your handbag and it’s really easy to reapply,’ she said.\nLana makes sure she gets up early before the UV levels peak to exercise or go to the beach where she uses invisible zinc as well as sun cream.\nShe also always wears a hat and clothes that cover her up as much as possible during the day and swears by linen for when the weather is hot.\nDespite her efforts to stay away from the sun, Lana always wanted a glowing bronze complexion which lead to her ‘addiction’ to fake tanning.\nDespite her efforts to stay away from the sun, Lana always wanted a glowing bronze complexion which lead to her ‘addiction’ to fake tanning\n‘Tanning is a religion for me,’ she joked.\n‘It’s a really nice way to feel better about my skin…My husband bought me a machine to do it for me at home which is so kind.’\nLana’s tanning obsession even saw her buy and ship a spray tan machine out to Italy for her destination wedding so she and some of her guests could have olive skin for her big day.\nShe started to notice the damage fake tanning products was doing to her dyed-blonde hair.\n‘I was experiencing this awful yellow banding through my hairline. It took me a little while to figure out the reason was the tan,’ she said.\n‘I went online to see if there was a solution and there wasn’t which is just crazy to me.’\nLana started looking into the issue further and discovered tanning products not only cause discolouration to lighter hair but also damage and breakage.\n‘Discoloration is only a very small part of the problem. Even virgin hair is really badly damaged by fake tan,’ she explained.\n‘The (hair) cuticles can become entirely cracked making the hair dry and rough. As soon as the cuticle is damaged everything can penetrate the hair and it becomes more porous.’\nBefore and after: Lana discovered tanning products can be as ‘damaging to hair as bleach’ causing discolouration as well as breakage and dryness\nIn December Lana launched Auriche offering products that treat and protect hair from self-tan mousse, spray tan, or gradual tanning lotion\nTanning products come into contact with the hair around the back of the neck and on the mid-lengths and ends that touch the back and shoulders which is where the most damage is seen.\nLana said many self tanners think the wispy hairs on the back of their neck are ‘baby hairs’ but they’re actually broken strands weakened by chemicals in tanning products.\nThe revelation of how bad tanning was for the hair set Lana on a path to create her own shampoo and conditioner specifically for those who love to use fake tan.\nShe spent months experimenting with different solutions on her kitchen bench while she had lot of free time during COVID lockdown before enlisting the help of a chemist to come up with an effective formula.\nOn December 1, after 18 months of researching and formulating, Lana launched Auriche offering products that treat and protect hair from self-tan mousse, spray tan, or gradual tanning lotion.\nShe created a range of products suited to tanners who either need to repair existing damage, prevent breakage from occurring and protect locks from chemicals in fake tanning products Lana said can be as harmful to the hair as bleach.",

    "text": "Simply Wall St. With EPS Growth And More, CTI Logistics (ASX:CLX) Makes An Interesting Case Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) December 29, 2023 at 2:02 a.m. · 3 min read For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in CTI Logistics (ASX:CLX). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide CTI Logistics with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\nSee our latest analysis for CTI Logistics\nHow Fast Is CTI Logistics Growing Its Earnings Per Share? In the last three years CTI Logistics' earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. In previous twelve months, CTI Logistics' EPS has risen from AU$0.20 to AU$0.22. That's a modest gain of 9.3%.\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. CTI Logistics maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 6.6% to AU$302m. That's progress.\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\nASX:CLX Earnings and Revenue History December 29th 2023 CTI Logistics isn't a huge company, given its market capitalisation of AU$113m.
