    "text": "The international community [must take immediate action](https://www.unocha.org/news/sudan-un-leaders-call-urgent-action-against-scourge-sexual-violence-amid-ongoing-conflict) to end the wave of sexual violence being carried out against women and girls in Sudan, two senior UN officials said on Thursday. Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten together with Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Joyce Msuya, said that more than a year into the battle for control of the country between rival militaries, the \"barbaric acts\" being committed \"echo the horrors witnessed in Darfur two decades ago\". They urged [Security Council](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/) members who met this week to debate Ms. Patten's latest report on sexual violence to send \"an unequivocal message: under international humanitarian law, civilians in Sudan must be protected and must never be subjected to acts of sexual violence, which constitute war crimes.\" The disturbing reports show how women and girls are being disproportionately impacted. Millions at risk Allegations of rape, forced marriages, sexual slavery, and trafficking of women and girls - especially in Khartoum, Darfur and Kordofan - continue to be recorded with millions of civilians at risk as they flee conflict areas in search of shelter, inside Sudan and in neighbouring countries. The two top women officials noted that the true scale of the crisis remains unseen, \"a result of severe underreporting due to stigma, fear of reprisals, and a lack of confidence in national institutions.\" Without more financial and political support for frontline responders, access to life-saving services will only continue to shrink, they warned. UN welcomes Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council Hopes rose on Thursday of political progress amid the multiple crises engulfing gang-ravaged Haiti, with the formal resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the official installation of the Transitional Presidential Council. Mr. Henry had agreed to step down in March after heavily armed criminal gangs seized the country's airport and blocked his return. He will be replaced by former Finance Minister Michel Patrick Boisvert, who takes over as interim Prime Minister. Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Stéphane Dujarric said the UN welcomed the newly-formed Council. Call for swift international police deployment \"We call on the new authorities and all stakeholders to expedite the full implementation of the transitional governance arrangements,\" he said. The Secretary-General reiterates his call for the swift deployment of the Multinational Security Support mission to Haiti, authorized by the Security Council in October last year, to support the Haitian National Police and return law and order to the streets after months of turmoil which has left millions in need, Mr. Dujarric added. \"The Secretary-General appeals to all Member States to ensure the Multinational Security Support mission receives the financial and logistical support it needs to succeed.\" Iran: Rights experts alarmed by death sentence imposed on rapper Toomaj Salehi UN [Human Rights Council](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/Home.aspx)-appointed independent experts [demanded the immediate release](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/04/iran-un-experts-alarmed-death-sentence-imposed-rapper-and-songwriter-toomaj) of Iranian rapper and songwriter Toomaj Salehi on Thursday and urged authorities to reverse his death sentence. \"Criticism of government policy, including through artistic expression is protected under the rights to freedom of expression and the right to take part in cultural life. It must not be criminalised,\" the experts said. \"Art must be allowed to criticise, to provoke, to push the boundaries in any society.\" They expressed alarm at his sentencing and alleged ill-treatment \"which appears to be related solely to the exercise of his right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity\". Freedom of expression \"As harsh as Mr. Salehi's songs are to the government, they are a manifestation of artistic freedom and cultural rights,\" they said. The rapper was initially sentenced to six years in prison for his role in the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests but was released after Iran's Supreme Court ruled that it had identified flaws in the original sentence. However, he was detained again on 30 November last year for expressing his opinion on the Iranian government and revealing that he was tortured and placed in solitary confinement for 252 days following his arrest in October 2022. Toomaj Saleh's harsh sentencing takes place against a backdrop of severe restriction on artistic freedom and other forms of expression in the country said the experts. \"We have received allegations that it is increasingly common for artists, activists and journalists to be arrested and detained on charges such as 'publishing false news' or 'propaganda against the state',\" the experts said. They called on Iran to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. Special Rapporteurs are not UN staff and are independent from any government or organization. They serve in their individual capacity and receive no salary for their work. [here](/savage-sexual-violence-in-sudan-haiti-council-1222711/).",

    "text": "LARCHWOOD — Class 2A No. 3 West Lyon won 3-1 over No. 9 Hinton in a regional final contest Monday.\n“We took the No. 3 team in the state to the last out,” Hinton head coach Jennifer Jacobs-List said. “Defensively, we played pretty solid against a team that is known for dominating their opponents. Offensively, we left 10 people on base, which is disappointing, but also speaks to our chances. We were right in this game the whole time.”\nAfter a 1-2-3 first inning, the Blackhawks got runners aboard after that, but could not push them around. Kaydence Smith reached on a base hit in the second inning while Addie Dunkel and Kayla Sypersma reached on hits in the third inning and moved up to second and third base, but were left stranded. The Blackhawks again got runners to second and third in the fourth inning, but could not score. A runner reached third base in the fifth but was left stranded. Hinton went down in order in the sixth before finally scoring a run in the seventh. Becca Lahrs came home as Sypersma picked up the RBI. Sypersma had the only multi-hit game for the Blackhawks.\nJersey Hawf drove in all three runs for West Lyon, two on a hit in the third inning and another in the sixth inning with a bases-loaded walk.\nThe three runs were charged to Sypersma, with two runs earned. Sypersma took the loss with two strikeouts in six innings. Hawf tossed the win for the Wildcats with six strikeouts in seven innings.\nHinton had two seniors on the roster, Ava Lang and Natalie Nelson.\n“We had two great senior leaders who modeled the right way to play Hinton softball,” Jacobs-List said. “They brought positive attitudes and efforts every day and were a joy to be around.”\nThe Blackhawks finished the season with a record of 19-6 while making their deepest postseason run in several years after losing in their first regional game the previous two seasons. The team was searching for its first state tournament appearance since 2010.\n“For the first time in sometime, we came to play this postseason,” Jacobs-List said. “Overall, this was a huge step forward for us as a program and should help push us to want to work more this offseason.”\nWest Lyon (28-1) will be the No. 3 seed in the Class 2A state tournament bracket as the school earns its fourth appearance at state in the sport and first since 2004. The Wildcats will face No. 6-seeded Cascade (20-9) in the state quarterfinals on July 22.",

But the signature — which appeared to look like a human — was not moving.\nMalibu SAR infrared image of the missing man. December 2024. (LA County Sheriff’s Dept.) “Believing the heat signature was of the missing person, Malibu SAR operators were deployed with medical and evacuation equipment,” officials detailed. “Upon arriving on scene, the rescuers observed the missing man suffering from cold related illness, confused and unable to walk. He was evaluated, wrapped in a blanket, and placed in a rescue basket.”\nThe man was then treated for his illness and put into an ambulance. The sheriff’s department did not share any update on the man’s condition as of Thursday, but called his rescue “a miracle just in time for the holidays” in its X post.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Great work by everyone involved,” Malibu Search and Rescue concluded.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "text": "Educació a Catalunya\nLes escoles catalanes tindran 550 nous docents per atendre alumnes amb necessitats educatives especials\nLa consellera Esther Niubó assegura que el curs 25/26 serà el del desplegament de l’escola inclusiva\nAvança que els resultats de les competències bàsiques de 6è de primària i 4t d’ESO no seran bons\nCatalunya restringirà encara més l’ús de mòbils i pantalles als centres educatius\nSelectivitat 2025 a Catalunya, avui en directe | Horaris, exàmens i última hora de la PAU\nLa consellera de Educació, Esther Niubó, este jueves /\nLa consellera d’Educació i FP, Esther Niubó, ha anunciat que el curs 25/26 serà el del desplegament de l’escola inclusiva, «una de les assignatures pendents del nostre sistema educatiu», com ella mateixa ha reconegut. En aquest sentit, ha remarcat que la inclusió de tot l’alumnat és un requisit per aconseguir l’excel·lència educativa. «Una assignatura pendent és fer realitat el sistema d’escola inclusiva. Tenim un marc normatiu que ja ho contempla. Però no n’hi ha prou. L’hem de desplegar amb determinació. Estem consolidant una agenda de treball reforçant la detecció precoç per intervenir abans, reforçant els equips d’atenció i el suport a les famílies», ha dit.\nPer fer-ho realitat, aquest proper curs 25/26 els centres d’educació especial començaran a col·laborar amb l’escola ordinària per avançar en aquest desplegament d’una educació inclusiva. «L’objectiu és que el 100% de centres d’educació especial, a més de la seva tasca d’atenció directa, ajudin els centres ordinaris a desplegar l’atenció a la inclusió. Això començarà a ser una realitat el curs vinent i suposarà una injecció de recursos», ha dit. Per començar, i en el marc de l’acord entre el Govern i els Comuns, es destinaran 550 dotacions docents noves per desplegar l’escola inclusiva.\nLa inclusió és un dels reptes més importants del sistema educatiu català, que es fa més urgent davant l’augment de les desigualtats econòmiques d’una banda i de la diversitat creixent de l’alumnat. Algunes xifres que reflecteixen aquesta situació: el 46% dels nens afirmen que els seus pares no els pregunten mai per com els va l’escola. I una xifra similar no fa cap activitat extraescolar.\nHa fet aquest anunci aquest dijous durant una conferència al Fòrum Europa de Tribuna Catalunya, en la qual ha estat acompanyada per Xavier Bonal, catedràtic de Sociologia de la Universitat de Barcelona (UB), que ha remarcat que les polítiques d’equitat i d’inclusió no estan disputades amb l’excel·lència educativa.\n«La millora educativa ha de ser profunda. És el repte més difícil dels pròxims anys. Avui no tots els estudiants catalans acaben l’ESO amb totes les garanties. Els mals resultats en informes internacionals ho constaten. I ja els avanço que els resultats de les competències bàsiques de 6è de primària i de 4t d’ESO no seran bons», ha dit abans de manifestar la seva confiança que «la millora és possible i la veurem aquest mandat». En aquest camí cap a l’excel·lència, Niubó ha insistit que això no serà possible sense inclusió.\nUniversalització de l’etapa 0-3\nL’educació infantil de 0-3 és, ha dit, un altre factor d’equitat educativa. Ha apuntat que les desigualtats no apareixen a l’escola, sinó que comencen abans. «Encara avui hi ha massa nens que no tenen accés a aquesta etapa. Volem avançar cap a la universalització de l’etapa 0-3», ha dit. Es farà, ha remarcat, buscant la complicitat dels ajuntaments i partint de l’oferta actual que hi ha. Ha anunciat que el Govern ja treballa en una llei de la universalització d’aquesta etapa educativa.Notícies relacionades\nUn altre factor d’estabilitat educativa, ha dit Niubó, és l’equip docent. Això és impossible si els equips canvien contínuament. Per això estabilitzarem de manera progressiva les plantilles, i així acabarem amb la interinitat. Començarem pels centres més complexos». Ha anunciat concursos anuals de trasllats. I la revisió de les necessitats dels centres de màxima complexitat per destinar-los els recursos necessaris.\nLes noves tecnologies i el seu paper en l’aprenentatge és un altre dels punts a què ha al·ludit Niubó. La consellera ha remarcat que l’ús de les pantalles té un impacte en la concentració de l’alumnat i ha defensat que és necessari revisar i establir la relació entre aprenentatge i tecnologia. Un grup d’experts des del febrer que està analitzant aquesta problemàtica. I serà aquest divendres quan es presenti el Pla de Digitalització Responsable, amb la filosofia d’un ús de la tecnologia responsable i al servei de l’aprenentatge. Un pla que serà regulatori i que anirà més enllà dels mòbils, incloent-hi, per tant, ‘tablets’ i ordinadors.",

    "text": "The only problem with tourist apartments is the tourists. The accommodation phenomena has been all over the headlines this summer with protests against the taking over of properties normally available for locals to buy as homes, but it’s not the only issue locals take with the growing trend. The iconic 30-storey Torres Martiricos in the centre of Malaga city, originally destined to be 450 permanent homes, have been having to endure noise into the early hours, fights, unfairly excessive use of the roof-top swimming pool, and rubbish dumped outside the bins. Just recently, the fire brigade and police were called when one drunk tourist emptied the contents of a fire extinguisher in the common areas of the 17th floor.\nIllegal occupation by tourist rental companies Almost half of the newly-built towers are illegally occupied by tourist apartments, causing a living nightmare for the genuine homeowners in the luxury towers. The courts have just decreed that 124 of the flats must be taken off the tourist registry of the Junta de Andalucia immediately because they were registered after the local government brought in laws limiting the tourist rental industry in February of 2024.\nMost Read on Euro Weekly News \"Son of Concorde\" completes its second successful flight test The latest dating trend in Spain: Tinder-Dona How ‘Rawdogging’ Flights Became the Trend of the Summer The actual forced vacating of the properties, however, is likely to take some time, perhaps even years, due to legal procedures and reasonable legal time for appeal. In the relatively tiny area that the towers occupy, there are currently over 500 properties on offer as tourist apartments being offered on AirBnB alone.\nTags: 'Tourists go home' , Airbnb , Malaga Share this story\nshare on Facebook share on Twitter share on WhatsApp share on LinkedIn share on Flipboard share on Email Sign up for personalised news Subscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nDaily Weekly By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.

    "text": "The vigilance of Pasco lifeguards is credited with saving the life of a teenager who went underwater at Memorial Aquatic Park on Tuesday. A lifeguard noticed the teen appeared to be getting tired while swimming in the mid-afternoon, Pasco Deputy Chief Chris Mortensen told the Tri-City Herald. The lifeguard jumped into the water, but wasn't able to reach the teen before the teen went under water. He grabbed the swimmer and got the teen to the edge of the pool quickly, said the deputy chief. \"The lifeguard was pretty heroic in his efforts,\" Mortensen said. \"The lifeguard had a good eye on the swimmer.\" Other lifeguards had a defibrillator prepared, called 911 and started performing CPR on the teen, who was breathing before firefighters arrived at the pool. Firefighters took the teen to Kadlec Regional Medical Center in Richland. The teen's condition was not released. Mortensen praised how well the lifeguards handled the situation. The lifeguard did a good job recognizing the person was struggling and was prepared to respond, he said. \"From what I've been told, the system ran flawlessly,\" Mortensen said. \"I think their training was enacted properly. ... They did a fantastic job. We're giving them a big round of applause for what they were able to do.\" Pasco officials announced on Facebook on Wednesday that swim lessons, recreational summer swim team and open and lap swim sessions are canceled though Friday. Thursday's canceled lessons are being rescheduled for Friday, June 28. Atomic and Channel Cats team practices restarted on Thursday. \"This decision allows us the necessary time to thoroughly review our safety procedures and support our staff during this period,\" city officials said in a Facebook post. Mortensen said they wanted to give lifeguards and other staff time to emotionally process what happened. The city also has provided counselors. ___ (c)2024 Tri-City Herald (Kennewick, Wash.)

    "text": "(Marcelo Rosa / Santuário Basílica Nossa Senhora da Piedade) A Catedral Cristo Rei terá uma programação especial para a passagem de fim de ano, segundo a Arquidiocese de Belo Horizonte. A previsão é que o arcebispo dom Walmor Oliveira de Azevedo celebre uma das cerimônias. Na véspera da virada, a igreja terá duas missas, celebradas às 8h e 10h30. Já as 18 horas ocorrerá a celebração da “Solenidade da Bem-Aventurada Virgem Maria, Mãe de Deus”, com a presença de Dom Walmor. Já no primeiro dia do ano, a missa será às 10h30, também na Catedral Cristo Rei, localizada na Rua Campo Verde, 165, bairro Juliana, região Norte da Capital. Um dos pontos turísticos de Belo Horizonte, a Serra da Piedade também contará com missas de ano novo. No domingo, a cerimônia está marcada para 19h. Haverá transmissão pelo Canal Mãe Piedade, no Youtube. Já na segunda, a Santa Missa Solene vai ocorrer às 9h e 15h.
