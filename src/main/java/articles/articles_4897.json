    "text": "In recent cryptocurrency news, three digital currencies have emerged as the leading gainers on January 5th. These are Osmosis, Celestia, and Kaspa, each showing significant growth in their values.\nOsmosis (OSMO), this token operates as a decentralized exchange within the\nCosmos network. It is important in connecting independent blockchains through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol. Osmosis’s price is $1.80, witnessing a substantial 24-hour trading volume of around $138 million.\nThis marks a notable 12.4% rise in just one day. Osmosis’s popularity has increased, especially considering its impressive $1.1 billion monthly volume in December, as\nreported by DefiLlama. Celestia (TIA) is known for its change blockchain framework. The recent data shows a price of $16.07 for Celestia, with its 24-hour trading volume hitting $831 million. This represents an 11.8% increase over the previous day and a 26.1% growth over the past week\nCelestia’s rising value can be attributed to its strategic airdrops since the launch of its mainnet beta in October. This move successfully garnered the interest of over 580,000 users, boosting TIA’s market presence.\nKaspa (KAS), a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that utilizes the GHOSTDAG protocol, is also making headlines. Currently priced at $0.113, Kaspa has enjoyed an 8.1% gain. This surge is linked to positive comments from cryptocurrency experts Leiner and Simo, who have hinted at the potential for further significant growth in the project.\nThese three cryptocurrencies exemplify the digital currency market’s dynamic and rapidly evolving nature. Their recent successes highlight their technical strengths, community support, and growing interest and confidence in the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nAlso read:\n[ChatGPT’s Top CryptoCurrency Picks for 2024]",

The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there.\nLast week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza.\nWeinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships.\nWeinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nHer brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims.\n\"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\"\nStory continues Vivian Silver\nVivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel.\n\"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club.\nHe said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming.\nZeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza.\nOn Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver.\nHe said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974.\nShe dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added.\nShe also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel.\nTiferet Lapidot\nTiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began.\nHer cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall.\nHer uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom.\nZlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage.\nHarel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral.\n\"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\"\nTiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nHarel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel.\nNetta Epstein\nIsraeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack.\nHis mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived.\nNetta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers.\nShachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion.\nShe said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service.\nHe was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city.\nShir Georgy\nIsraeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im.\nGeorgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death.\n\"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message.\nBouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured.\nGeorgy's funeral was held in Israel.\nAdi Vital-Kaploun\nAdi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa.\nThe group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area.\nThe family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack.\n\"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview.\nThe family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household.\nShe was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player.\nAfter completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said.\n\"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\"\nBen Mizrachi\nCanadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel.\nMizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C.\nEzra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force.\nHilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him.\nNurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school.\n\"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\"\nAlexandre Look\nAlexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival.\nLook, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post.\n\"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said.\nFriend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship.\nIn a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel.\nHe was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said.\n\"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "ATLANTA ( WANF /Gray News) - A law firm in Atlanta has expanded its previous lawsuit against Walmart, demanding $750 million and alleging the stores provide a “fertile crime scene for sex offenders.”\nFive women filed a lawsuit in November against the company and against Lester Jolly, who worked as a janitor at a Walmart in Decatur, Georgia. They accused Jolly of filming them in the bathroom at the store and said Walmart was negligent by not preventing the incidents.\nJolly was arrested in June and charged with two counts of unlawful eavesdropping or surveillance.\nThe law firm Jonathan W. Johnson LLC said Jolly potentially targeted more than 100 women and children and sent the videos to third parties.\nThe suit also said Jolly is part of a wider pattern, citing 48 accounts of Walmart customers or employees who were sexually violated in bathrooms.\n“This case is about a nationwide systemic practice of reckless behavior and intentional concealment of crimes by Walmart for crimes occurring in its bathrooms,” the amended complaint, filed on Tuesday, states in part. “Most of the victims are unaware that intimate videos of them taken in the toilet have been recorded and disseminated.”\nThe lawsuit claims the company allowed Jolly to continue filming after learning of the incidents and didn’t notify victims about what had happened.\nOne of the plaintiffs, another Walmart employee, also said management told her not to talk about what Jolly did. When she warned other women, she was fired in retaliation, the lawsuit said.\nWhile speaking to an attorney with Jonathan W. Johnson LLC, Jolly admitted to filming five or six women, according to a phone call transcript attached to the amended lawsuit. He said he was being blackmailed to film the videos and that the unknown party had hacked his phone. He denied having filmed children in the bathroom.\nThe lawsuit names several causes for the legal action. Those include different types of negligence and invasions of privacy, infliction of emotional distress, premises liability and child endangerment.\nIt also says the Walmart in Decatur is a “hotbed of criminal activity.” A blotter shows the DeKalb County police have been called to the store more than 1,000 times since 2019 for everything from shoplifting to sexual battery.\n“This history demonstrates that Walmart is indifferent to the safety of both its customers and (its) employees, in violation of its legal duties to them and in violations of common decency and ethics,” the lawsuit said.\nIn a statement, Walmart said it is reviewing the amended complaint.\n“The safety and security of everyone in our stores, and respect for the individual is always a top priority,” the company said.\nCopyright 2024 WANF via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Illinois suspended star guard Terrence Shannon Jr. on Thursday after a warrant was issued for his arrest on a rape charge.\nThe Douglas County (Kansas) District Attorney issued the warrant for the Big Ten's second-leading scorer on Wednesday.\nThe alleged incident occurred while Shannon was in Lawrence, Kan., to attend the Illinois-Kansas football game on Sept. 8. Shannon traveled to Lawrence and turned himself in shortly after learning of the warrant, and he posted $50,000 bond to satisfy terms of his release, his attorney said in a statement Thursday.\nCharging documents reveal Shannon would face a \"minimum of 147 months to a maximum of 653 months in prison and/or a fine of up to $300,000 and 36 months post-release supervision,\" if convicted.\nAttorney Mark P. Sutter said Shannon intends to take the case to trial.\nPeople are also reading…\n\"Since September, when these allegations surfaced, Terrence has cooperated with law enforcement throughout the investigation, declaring his innocence from the beginning,\" Sutter said in a statement. \"Now, several months later, my office learned that formal charges were filed against him yesterday in Lawrence, KS. In less than 24 hours, my client responded, and he voluntarily surrendered to local authorities for processing and release. Terrence is innocent of these charges, and he intends to take his case to trial.\"\nIllinois officials released a statement announcing that Shannon had been immediately suspended from all team activities.\n\"The University and DIA (Division of Intercollegiate Athletics) take allegations of sexual misconduct seriously while respecting due process and the presumption of innocence afforded through the legal system.\n\"DIA and Urbana campus officials have been aware of a Lawrence police investigation into Shannon since late September but, until Wednesday, had yet to receive actionable information. Shannon's arrest triggers the DIA student-athlete misconduct policy. Under that policy, Shannon has been immediately suspended from all team activities. Any change to Shannon's status will be communicated in a timely manner.\"\nShannon is having an All-American-caliber season, averaging 21.7 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 11 starts for the 11th-ranked Fighting Illini (9-2, 1-0 Big Ten).\nThe 6-foot-6 senior from Chicago has career averages of 13.5 points and 3.9 rebounds in 125 games (95 starts) for Texas Tech (2019-22) and Illinois.\n--Field Level Media\nOriginally published on\nfieldlevelmedia.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.",
