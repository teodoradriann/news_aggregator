    "text": "Colorado decision was early Christmas present for Trump\nThe Colorado Supreme Court ruled that former President Donald Trump cannot be on the Colorado primary ballot. It’s their opinion he is disqualified because of the insurrection clause in the Constitution -- though Trump has never been charged with insurrection.\nTrump’s numbers have continued to rise in the polls with each accusation by the Democrats. It’s one thing when numerous lawsuits are filed against Trump that do not affect voters directly; it’s another thing when a court attempts to keep a candidate off the ballot, especially the leading candidate in a presidential primary.\nIn the U.S.A., people vote and Trump will be thanking the Colorado court when, in my opinion, his poll numbers will soar because of the early Christmas gift Trump did not expect.\nBECKY SMITH , ROSWELL\nPrimary purpose of college is education, not entertainment\nPerhaps 30 years ago, I saw news about a professor at UGA complaining that her football-playing students were being given unmerited advantages over other students. Their college participation was more highly credited for athletics than for academics. State taxpayers were required to subsidize people bringing reduced economic advantages to the state through overall employment scenarios.\nAn AJC Dec. 18 article told statistics of former UGA football players having far lower graduation rates than most other NCAA Division 1 (athletics) universities.\nWhile sports generate entertainment for many people, the relative value to the majority of Georgians paying taxes to subsidize college sports is too low as contrasted with the numbers of economic and other life functions supported by academic achievements and improved employment for far higher numbers of Georgians.\nRequired taxes are extortion if applied to things unhelpful to more Georgians. Taxes fund public colleges. Colleges’ primary purpose is higher education, not entertainment.\nTOM STREETS , ATLANTA",

Será a primeira vez desde 1970 que um jogo da primeira semana da temporada regular da NFL ocorre em uma noite de sexta-feira.\n“Estamos chateados, claro, por não jogarmos em frente à nossa torcida, na Filadélfia, na estreia, mas estamos também muito animados”, disse Sirianni. “Essa é a minha primeira viagem internacional como técnico, então estou entusiasmado para ir ao estádio, ver o estádio e jogar na frente de uma ótima torcida amanhã.”\nO quarterback Jalen Hurts concordou com o treinador, dizendo ser uma “benção” disputar um jogo internacional no maior país da América do Sul.\n“Estou muito agradecido pela forma como o Brasil e a cidade de São Paulo nos recebeu”, afirmou.\nAlguns jogadores dos Eagles, incluindo o wide receiver AJ Brown e o cornerback Darius Slay, mostraram preocupação sobre a sua segurança na cidade.\nO Estado de São Paulo argumenta que tem uma taxa de homicídios parecida com a da Califórnia e menor que a de Washington DC. Além disso, o governo prometeu intensificar a segurança e escoltar as equipes até seus hotéis, locais de treinamento e ao estádio.\n“Tudo tem sido muito primeira classe desde que colocamos nossos pés neste país. Somos muito gratos e estamos ansiosos para jogar em frente aos nossos torcedores”, disse Sirianni.\n“No fim, viemos aqui para trabalhar, e nosso trabalho não é vir para visitar ou algo assim. Nosso trabalho é vir para jogar futebol americano contra um oponente muito bom e tentar vencer essa partida”, concluiu.\nTécnico do Philadelphia Eagles se diz animado com jogo no Brasil e minimiza preocupação com segurança",

    "title": "Election Disinformation From Elon Musk Is Drawing Billions of Views on X",
    "text": "Elon Musk is not just the Trump-supporting owner of the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. It turns out he is also one of the platform’s biggest peddlers of election-related disinformation, according to a new report published Thursday by the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\nThe report from CCDH, a nonprofit organization focused on protecting civil liberties and holding social media companies accountable, found that 50 false or misleading posts shared by Musk on X between Jan. 1 and July 31 of this year racked up a staggering 1.2 billion views. The group categorized the posts under three main themes: false claims that Democrats are “importing voters” through illegal immigration (the bulk of the content that researchers examined); false claims that voting is vulnerable to fraud; and a manipulated video, also known as a deepfake , of Vice President Kamala Harris. Musk endorsed Donald Trump for president last month, after Trump nearly was assassinated .\nAccording to the report, while independent fact-checkers found the content in all of those 50 posts shared by Musk to be false or misleading, none of the posts in question contained a “community note,” X’s user-generated fact-checking system that the company promise’s can contextualize “potentially misleading posts.” Just this week, Musk claimed in a post on X that community notes offer “a clear and immediate way to refute anything false in the replies,” adding, “the same is not true for legacy media who lie relentlessly, but there is no way to counter their propaganda.”\nA deepfake on X exposed by Mother Jones on Sunday had quickly drawn more than 620,000 views and bore no indication that it was doctored footage.\nImran Ahmed, CEO of the CCDH, said in a statement accompanying the report that Musk “is abusing his privileged position as owner of a small, but politically influential, social media platform to sow disinformation that generates discord and distrust.”\nX responded to a request for comment from Mother Jones with an automated message saying, “busy now, please check back later.” (The company may have retired the automated poop emoji .)\nAs I reported recently, in addition to being false or misleading, at least some of this content appears to violate X’s own terms of service. On July 26, Musk shared a deepfake that falsely appeared to show Harris calling herself “the ultimate diversity hire” and degrading President Biden. “This is amazing,” Musk wrote in his post sharing the video, accompanied by a laughing emoji. Musk’s post has received more than 135 million views, and it remains online—despite the fact that, as the CCDH report notes, X’s policy prohibits the sharing of “synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm.”\nX says it only deletes such posts in cases of “high-severity violations of the policy, including misleading media that have a serious risk of harm to individuals or communities”—though it does not define how it measures “high-severity violations” or “serious risk of harm.”\nAnd while Musk personally has massive reach, with more than 193 million followers on X, the CCDH report reveals problems that are systemic, allowing other users who have significant reach also to spread political disinformation. One example: As I reported on Sunday, an account that reposts Donald Trump’s feed from Truth Social on X shared an obviously manipulated video of Harris that appeared to show her struggling to complete a sentence. Trump first posted the video to his Truth Social platform on Saturday, though it’s unclear who originally altered the video. When Mother Jones exposed its spread on X on Sunday, it had drawn more than 620,000 views, and bore no indication that it clearly was doctored footage .\nWhen I inquired with the Trump campaign about the video, spokesperson Steven Cheung just asserted ( profanely ) that it was authentic. But by Monday, following my inquiry to X about the video, the post on X had been updated with a label calling it “manipulated media”—though the video remains up. (Cheung did not respond to a further request for comment.)\nThe CCDH report comes as the latest example of the growing scrutiny of X and its platforming of disinformation targeting Harris ahead of the November election. On Monday, five secretaries of state sent Musk a letter demanding he “immediately implement changes” to Grok, the AI-powered search assistant available to premium subscribers on X, after it falsely told users that Harris declared her candidacy too late to appear on ballots in nine states.\nThe scrutiny does not appear to concern Musk. This week, the X owner has continued attacking Harris on the platform he purchased in 2022, baselessly claiming Harris is “quite literally a Communist.” Expect more to come, especially given that Musk, according to Trump, is reportedly set to “interview” Trump on Monday. If it occurs, that conversation isn’t likely to focus on or stick to facts; as my colleague Mark Follman points out, Musk clearly is not a journalist .",

Nun gibt es eine Einigung. Wie sieht sie aus?\nMurr - Im Tarifkonflikt beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat gibt es eine Einigung - es ist zugleich nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: „Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.“\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert. dpa",

    "text": "According to research, nearly 35 percent of U.S. adults suffer from chronic inflammation , a condition that often goes undetected until serious health complications develop, medical experts warn.\n“Inflammation acts as both protector and potential enemy,” says Dr. Sarah Chen, immunologist at Stanford Medical Center. “While acute inflammation helps healing, chronic inflammation silently damages the body over time.”\nResearch published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine reveals chronic inflammation contributes to arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and other conditions. Despite its prevalence, routine inflammation screening remains uncommon during annual physicals.\nThe condition manifests through various symptoms, including persistent joint stiffness in the morning hours, unexplained swelling that may affect multiple body areas and general fatigue that interferes with daily activities.\nDr. Michael Torres, rheumatologist, notes several factors trigger chronic inflammation. Poor dietary choices high in processed sugars and unhealthy fats can promote inflammatory responses, while persistent infections may cause ongoing inflammation throughout the body. Environmental toxins from air pollution and certain chemicals also contribute to inflammatory conditions.\nTesting options include measuring C-reactive protein levels, which typically remain below 3 mg/L in healthy individuals. Doctors also examine erythrocyte sedimentation rate to detect inflammation, while elevated ferritin levels may signal inflammatory conditions.\n“Early detection through these markers allows for timely intervention,” Torres says. “We can often manage inflammation effectively through lifestyle changes before it causes serious damage.”\nDr. Lisa Wong, immunologist, emphasizes prevention through diet. Anti-inflammatory foods include fatty fish rich in omega-3s, leafy greens packed with antioxidants, and berries containing beneficial compounds that fight inflammation.\nTreatment approaches combine medication with lifestyle changes. Regular moderate exercise helps reduce inflammatory markers, while stress management techniques like meditation show promising results in lowering inflammation levels. Adequate sleep proves crucial, as sleep deprivation increases inflammatory responses.\nHealth care providers recommend annual inflammation screening for at-risk patients, particularly those with family histories of inflammatory conditions or existing health issues that may trigger chronic inflammation.\n“Understanding and controlling inflammation represents a crucial frontier in preventive medicine,” Chen says. “We must shift from treating symptoms to identifying and addressing root causes.”",

    "title": "Lula: Igreja tem papel vital em País mais justo, em carta para marcha para Jesus Por Estadão Conteúdo",
    "text": "O Palácio do Planalto divulgou na tarde desta quinta-feira, 30, uma carta do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) lida durante a Marcha para Jesus, que acontece em São Paulo. Na mensagem, Lula tece elogios ao evento, lembra de ter sancionado a lei que criou o Dia Nacional da Marcha para Jesus em 2009 e afirma que a Igreja desempenha um \"papel vital\" no compromisso de construir um país mais \"justo e inclusivo\", que, diz, norteia as ações do governo federal.\nNa carta, o presidente diz também que, como cristão, se sente \"regozijado de ver a dimensão extraordinária\" que o evento tomou e o papel significativo que desempenha na vida de muitos brasileiros, \"promovendo valores de paz, fé, amor ao próximo e solidariedade\". Escreve também ser sempre \"uma honra e uma alegria\" receber o convite para participar da celebração. \"Quero expressar meu respeito e meu reconhecimento pela realização de mais uma edição deste evento, que reúne milhares de fiéis em um momento de fé, unidade e oração\", afirma.\nO presidente foi convidado a participar da marcha, mas foi representado pelo ministro da Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU), Jorge Messias, como ocorreu no ano passado. Evangélico, Messias é considerado uma ponte entre o governo Lula e essa vertente religiosa, com a qual a gestão petista tenta se aproximar. \"Temos o compromisso profundo, com todos os brasileiros, de construir um país mais justo e inclusivo. As ações do meu governo são desenvolvidas a partir dessa premissa e buscam promover uma vida digna à família brasileira. E a Igreja desempenha um papel vital nesse compromisso, que se reflete na sua ação social e no suporte espiritual de seus fiéis. Por isso, acredito que, juntos, podemos fazer muito mais pelo bem-estar, a paz e a harmonia de nosso povo\", afirma.\n\"Uma das características mais formidáveis da Marcha é a capacidade de reunir fiéis de diferentes igrejas cristãs do Brasil e do mundo, sendo um evento aberto e de inclusão, que permite a participação de toda a população. Isso é uma demonstração inequívoca da prática daquilo que nos ensinou Jesus: 'a comunhão', que promove e fortalece os vínculos entre as pessoas. Conforme nos mandou Jesus: 'amem-se uns aos outros. Assim como eu amei vocês, vocês devem se amar uns aos outros. Se vocês tiverem amor uns para com os outros, todos reconhecerão que vocês são meus discípulos' (Jo 13,25-26). Esse ensinamento é o que norteia o trabalho do nosso governo, que tem um foco muito preciso: união e reconstrução\", diz o presidente.\nLula ainda afirma ter \"certeza\" de que a Marcha para Jesus deste ano será, como nos anos anteriores, \"um evento abençoado, que renovará a esperança e a fé de todos os participantes\". \"Como, infelizmente, não consegui estar presente, pedi ao ministro-chefe da Advocacia-Geral da União, Jorge Messias, que representasse a mim e ao governo. Ele está honrado, como também estou. Que Deus abençoe a todos\", conclui o petista.\nLula: Igreja tem papel vital em País mais justo, em carta para marcha para Jesus",
