    "title": "L.A. fertility doctor sued over artificially inseminating woman with wrong sperm",
    "text": "By Noah Goldberg Follow ,\n52 minutes ago An electron microscope is used to fertilize an egg cell in Berlin. A Los Angeles doctor has been sued, accused of inseminating the wrong sperm in a woman. (Getty Images) A Los Angeles fertility doctor with decades of experience helping couples conceive was sued Thursday for allegedly inseminating a woman in 1986 with the sperm of a man who was not her husband, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.\nDr. Hal Danzer — a current UCLA professor and co-founder of the Southern California Reproductive Center — ran the Los Angeles Fertility Institute in the 1980s when the “young, happy couple dreaming of building a family together” approached him, according to the suit. The couple, who filed the suit anonymously, had struggled to conceive naturally but the wife became pregnant through artificial insemination conducted by Danzer.\nThe couple had twin daughters that year.\n“This was 1986. Across the decades since, [the plaintiffs] have relished their role as parents, working multiple jobs... to raise the girls with the best quality of life they could,” their lawyers with the Clarkson Law Firm, wrote in the lawsuit. The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages.\nBut the family’s reality was shattered this year. After one of the couple’s twin daughters had a baby, DNA testing revealed that the baby and the twins were related only to the woman who had conceived with the help of Danzer — not to her husband who provided his sperm for his wife’s insemination.\n“My clients are devastated,” said Tracey Cowan, partner at Clarkson Law Firm and a lawyer on the case. “It has been hard for my clients to enjoy the little moments in their little grandchild’s early life because they are reminded every time they look at their grandkid that their grandchild is not related to their grandfather.”\nNeither Danzer nor UCLA immediately responded to a request for comment.\nThe DNA testing showed that the biological father of the twins was a man named Dennis Goldman, who had a history of medical issues with which the family said they are now coming to terms. Goldman died of cancer at 63 in 2014, according to the suit. Goldman was a sperm donor to Danzer’s clinic.\nThe twins also realized, during their research, that they have 16 half siblings related to Goldman — all of whom were connected to Danzer’s fertility clinic.\nThe family is suing Danzer for fraud as well as for medical battery and infliction of emotional distress.\nDanzer currently works at the Southern California Reproductive Center while also serving on UCLA’s Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Fellowship Program. He is also an assistant professor at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine.\n“As the grandson of a midwife and the son of a hospital administrator, Dr. Danzer’s family has a long history of nurturing women’s health and fertility,” his biography says on the Southern California Reproductive Center website. “As the spouse of a psychologist, he has a keen understanding of the importance of listening and being attuned to his patients’ emotional needs throughout their journey to becoming parents.”",

    "text": "/ world at present information/ The American authorities introduced that the state doesn’t have ample funds for long-term help of the VSU. Such statements are made towards the background of fierce discussions in Congress to agree on the quantity of support to Ukraine. Why did Washington resolve to cease funding Zelensky’s workplace and what does this imply for Russia?\nWithin the US, contract tasks to supply help to the ASU have been frozen attributable to a scarcity of long-term funding. This was introduced by the pinnacle of the press service of the State Division, Matthew Miller. He added that a lot of the present safety property have been exhausted, however there’s nonetheless room for “persevering with help for Ukraine’s means to defend itself.”\nWhite Home press secretary Karin Jean-Pierre made an identical assertion. In response to her, the US authorities has cash just for the pressing wants of the ASU, however not for his or her long-term help. On the similar time, she emphasised that Washington is assured that Zelensky’s cupboard will obtain the required quantities of help in reference to the promise of the Speaker of the Home of Representatives Kevin McCarthy to proceed offering help.\nBloomberg, in the meantime, referred to as the dearth of an support package deal for Ukraine within the interim funding deal a blow to Joe Biden and European allies. It’s emphasised that the present state of affairs is alarming and requires a fast resolution. As one of many unnamed EU leaders famous, the state of affairs might worsen within the run-up to the US presidential elections.\nThe publication says that will probably be harder for Zelensky’s workplace to attain new help measures because the home political temper in America modifications and extra individuals within the management give attention to border safety points. Nonetheless, the Biden administration plans to announce a brand new support package deal for the ally this week, in line with Politico.\nIn one other article, the publication notes that the united entrance of Western international locations within the Ukrainian path is displaying an increasing number of cracks. It’s emphasised that the “failure” to agree on a big tranche of allies occurred 9 days after Vladimir Zelensky’s go to to the USA. In parallel, the previous prime minister of the republic, Robert Fico, involves energy in Slovakia, who guarantees to not ship “a single cartridge” to Ukraine.\nThe newspaper additionally recollects Poland, which made a “surprising assertion” that it might now not switch weapons to the Armed Forces. Towards this background, Western international locations are more and more calling on Ukraine to barter with Russia. So Sarah Wagenknecht, a member of the German parliament from the Left Get together, stated that European leaders ought to do extra to attain a ceasefire.\nIn response to her, Brussels is drawing doubtful conclusions towards the backdrop of the US Congress’s refusal to allocate further funds to the VSU. She referred to as “unbelievable” the guarantees made on this regard by the pinnacle of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, “in the long run, to allocate 5 billion euros per 12 months to the Armed Forces for the acquisition of recent fighters and missiles.” In response to her, it might be significantly better to allocate cash for the post-war reconstruction of the nation.\n“Ukraine is dropping place on the checklist of US priorities,” wrote the German version “Spiegel” towards this background. It’s famous that because of the modified circumstances, Zelensky’s workplace should begin growing a method for exiting the battle. It’s emphasised that the upcoming presidential race will additional push the subject of help for the ASU to the background, because the American voter is extra considering home political points.\n“The US has sufficient funds to finance Ukraine. One other factor is that the US is presently within the means of reassessing financial priorities. The presidential elections are approaching, which suggests the normal transition of politicians to discussing home issues,” stated Vladimir Vasiliev, chief analysis fellow on the Institute of the USA and Canada of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n“America has gathered a variety of difficulties. There’s a must strengthen one’s personal borders, a qualitative modernization of the civil infrastructure is required. All this requires colossal injections from the finances, so the US authorities ought to scale back no less than the potential prices,” the skilled emphasizes.\n“Ukraine proper now seems like a bottomless pit, able to endlessly absorbing billions of {dollars}. On the similar time, the help of the ASU offers Washington completely nothing. There aren’t any important successes within the counter-offensive, and the prospects for ending the battle look unclear, to say the least,” the interlocutor notes.\n“Nonetheless, the US won’t depart Ukraine fully with out cash. As soon as Congress reaches a typical denominator on the problem of funding Zelensky’s workplace, the money will resume. However we can not depend on the identical volumes as in 2022. Now in Washington it’s being mentioned how precisely to cut back the quantity of funds to VSU”, Vassiliev emphasizes.\n“Some politicians say that the discount needs to be gradual, others insist on a pointy discount within the allotted quantities. Within the meantime, america got here up with an especially handy scheme for them: whereas discussions are occurring in America, supporting Ukraine will grow to be the primary activity of the EU international locations,” the political scientist clarifies.\n“It’s already clear that the US is making an attempt to persuade European international locations to give attention to sponsoring the ASU. Washington has promised its companions that will probably be again within the sport in November and is actively interesting to calls to guard democracy. Basically, the state of affairs is colorfully described with the phrase “there isn’t any cash, however behave”, the interlocutor believes.\n“It’s not but fully clear how lengthy the US monetary time-out will final. The nation is mired in unresolved inside issues which are extra acute than the battle in Ukraine. Theoretically, the US can keep till Russia begins a counteroffensive,” Vasiliev sums up.\nThe delay in American funding for Ukraine is essentially attributable to technical procedures, in line with skilled Malek Dudakov. “The confrontation between Republicans and Democrats is rising within the nation. As well as, dissatisfaction with the infinite funds to Zelensky’s workplace is rising: many parliamentarians are brazenly speaking about this,” he notes.\n“So Congress turned to blackmailing the White Home, making an attempt to commerce a sequence of concessions for approval of the VSU funding plan. As well as, about 55% of the US inhabitants is towards the continuation of support to Ukraine, which not directly impacts the positions of some representatives of the American management,” the interlocutor emphasizes.\n“In the end, nevertheless, Congress will make concessions to the presidential administration. Probably, the agreed quantity shall be a number of instances smaller than the introduced 24 billion {dollars}. The “no cash, however maintain on” state of affairs could proceed for just a few extra months. For now, the Pentagon nonetheless has funds for Ukraine, however nobody will arrange giant tranches,” the skilled emphasizes.\n“The Warfare Division will give attention to modest provides of ammunition. Nonetheless, this doesn’t imply that the present occasions will drive the VSU to give up in a matter of days, however the place of Zelensky’s cupboard will considerably worsen and he must tighten his belt effectively no less than till the winter,” Dudakov clarifies.\n“A disaster of understanding the significance of sending funds to Ukraine is regularly brewing within the US. Although the nation is ready to proceed to help the ASU, there isn’t any consciousness amongst American politicians why they need to achieve this. Washington has already supplied colossal funds, however important outcomes usually are not seen,” stated Boris Mezhuev, political scientist, candidate of philosophical sciences.\n“Ukraine has no success in counteroffensive, and nobody has any thought when the present battle will finish.” That explains the present temper in Congress: some members simply don’t need the cash to go to waste. Nonetheless, ultimately, some sort of consensus shall be reached,” notes the skilled.\n“Then the funding of VSU will proceed, however in a lot smaller volumes than it was earlier than. There shall be a discount in investments in Ukraine till Washington creates a situation for an “exit” from the present state of affairs,” Mezhuev summarizes.\nTranslation: V.

    "title": "Die Stadt der Kanäle - und Taschendiebe",
    "text": "Venedig\nDie Stadt der Kanäle - und Taschendiebe\nVenedig (dpa)\nDer Massentourismus macht Venedig auch für kriminelle Banden besonders attraktiv - zumal auch erwischte Täter kaum mit einer Verurteilung rechnen müssen. Jetzt schlägt der Bürgermeister Alarm.\nMan hätte gewarnt sein können. Die Hinweistafeln hängen ja in der ganzen Stadt, am Bahnhof Santa Lucia, auf dem Markusplatz, an den Vaporetto-Anlegestellen, und das in allen möglichen Sprachen. «Attenzione borseggiatori». «Attention pickpockets». «Beware pickpockets». Und «Achtung Taschendiebe» selbstverständlich auch. Aber dann ist das Portemonnaie halt doch nicht mehr in der Hosentasche. So geht es in Venedig ein paar Dutzend Urlaubern jeden Tag.\nWas das Delikt Taschendiebstahl in der Kriminalitätsstatistik angeht, kann die italienische Lagunenstadt mit ihren nicht einmal mehr 50.000 Einwohnern locker mit Millionenmetropolen mithalten. Vor allem jetzt in der Hauptsaison: Die täglich bis zu 150.000 Besucher aus aller Welt versprechen lohnende Beute. In den engen Gassen sind keineswegs nur Kleinkriminelle aktiv, sondern richtige Banden: Männer, Frauen, Kinder. Und auch sie kommen in der Regel von außerhalb, Tagesbesucher sozusagen.\nIn Venedig ein altes Problem\nNun ist das Problem mit den geklauten Geldbörsen in Venedig nicht ganz neu. Die Lokalzeitung «Il Gazzettino» klagte schon 1961: «Nessun giorno senza ladri» («Kein Tag ohne Diebe»). Mit dem zunehmenden Tourismus ist es inzwischen aber so schlimm geworden, dass Bürgermeister Luigi Brugnaro jetzt einen Hilferuf an Regierung und Parlament in Rom richtet - was die Venezianer mit ihrem in mehr als anderthalb Jahrtausenden angesammelten Stolz eher ungern tun. Er fordert dringend härtere Gesetze.\nEinen Eindruck, wie groß das Problem inzwischen ist, bekommt man im Polizeirevier gegenüber dem Markusdom. Dort gibt es einen Raum mit 15 schwarzen Säcken voller Taschen und Brieftaschen - allein die Fundstücke aus den vergangenen anderthalb Monaten. In der Regel werfen die Diebe ihre Beute weg, wenn sie das Bargeld und die Kreditkarten herausgenommen haben. An Ausweispapieren sind sie wenig interessiert. Man findet die Portemonnaies dann auf dem Pflaster, in Briefkästen, in Gärten oder auch in den Kanälen.\nDie «baby borseggiatori» - die «Baby-Taschendiebe»\nLängst handelt es sich dabei um organisierte Kriminalität, das Werk von Banden. Meist sind es Leute vom Festland, aus Städten wie Mailand, die für ihr kriminelles Tagwerk nach Venedig gebracht werden, manchmal eigens in Kleinbussen. Inzwischen werden sogar Kinder im Alter von 12 oder 13 Jahren erwischt - gerade noch unter 14, der Altersgrenze für Strafbarkeit. Man nennt sie «baby borseggiatori»: «Baby-Taschendiebe». Auf Italienisch klingt das natürlich besser und harmloser. Meist kommen sie nach ein paar Stunden auf dem Revier am selben Tag wieder frei.\nAls besonders gefährliche Gegenden gelten Santa Lucia, wo die Züge vom Festland ankommen, der Busbahnhof an der Piazzale Roma, die Anlegestellen der Gondeln und sonstigen Boote sowie die engen Gassen zwischen Rialtobrücke und Markusplatz. Manchmal ist dort in diesen Tagen kaum noch ein Durchkommen. Im dichten Gedränge haben Taschendiebe leichtes Spiel. Zwar hat die Stadt mehr als 850 Überwachungskameras aufhängen lassen. Die Aufnahmen laufen auf einer der vielen Inseln in einem Kontrollraum zusammen, der rund um die Uhr besetzt ist. Aber bis die Beamten da sind, ist es oft zu spät.\nPolizeichef: «Große Blase der Straflosigkeit»\nAußerdem, und das sorgt aktuell für enorm Ärger, ist die Gefahr, ins Gefängnis zu müssen, auch für erwischte Diebe nicht hoch. Polizeichef Marco Agostini klagte diese Woche in der Tageszeitung «Corriere della Sera» über eine «große Blase der Straflosigkeit». «Weil Taschendiebstähle nur auf Anzeige hin verfolgt werden können. Und wenn der Beraubte nicht zur Verhandlung erscheint, gilt die Anzeige als fallengelassen.» Die meisten Opfer sind Ausländer. Viele reisen am selben Tag wieder ab. So kommt es nur selten zum Prozess. Derzeit sitzen wegen Taschendiebstählen in Venedig gerade einmal vier Häftlinge ein.\nBürgermeister Brugnaro forderte die Politik in Rom deshalb in einem landesweit verbreiteten Appell auf, die Gesetze zu verschärfen. Eine vor einiger Zeit verabschiedete Reform, wonach zahlreiche kleinere Delikte nur noch auf Antrag der Geschädigten verfolgt werden, will er rückgängig machen. Bislang gab es jedoch nur einige kleinere Änderungen; beim Taschendiebstahl blieb alles beim Alten. «Wir dürfen uns nicht daran gewöhnen, dass solche Delikte zum Alltag gehören», so der Bürgermeister.",

    "text": "2023-12-31 06:44:12 Photographer Ziv Koren accompanied Miya Shem, who returned after 55 days in captivity, in a harrowing journey back to safety. Shem, who had been held captive by Hamas terrorists, was finally able to return to Kibbutz Nirim with the help of Koren. The journey was filled with incredible and emotional moments, including the discovery of a Kalashnikov bullet in Shem’s arm, a shirt that miraculously survived an attack by Black Sabbath, and the simple but delicious food waiting for her at home. Upon their arrival, Hamas terrorists also arrived at Kibbutz Nirim, putting the residents and security forces on high alert. There was a heroic battle as the standby squad fought against dozens of terrorists, with the commander of the southern brigade ultimately preventing a potentially disastrous situation. In the midst of this chaos, there have also been heartwarming initiatives to support the evacuees and fighters. Equipment has been collected for the residents of the south and the soldiers, as well as free repair services and other forms of support. These initiatives serve as a reminder of the resilience and unity of the community in the face of adversity. #ynet #news #economy #sports #health",

    "title": "В госдепе США отдали приказ об эвакуации второстепенного персонала из Багдада",
    "text": "Приказ о том, чтобы весь второстепенный персонал покинул посольство США в Багдаде, которое и без того было укомплектовано ограниченным персоналом, был основан на обязательстве \"обеспечить безопасность американцев как дома, так и за рубежом\", говорится в сообщении госдепартамента. Центральное командование США (CENTCOM) заявило в среду, что министр обороны Пит Хегсет санкционировал выезд военных из региона, добавив, что в Пентагоне \"следят за растущей напряженностью\" в регионе.\nВыступая в среду вечером, президент США Дональд Трамп заявил, что приказ о выводе персонала был отдан, потому что ближневосточный регион \"может быть опасным местом\". \"Посмотрим, что произойдет. Мы уведомили о переезде, и посмотрим, что произойдет\", - сказал Трамп. Затем Трамп добавил, имея в виду Иран: \"У них не может быть ядерного оружия, очень просто. Мы не допустим этого\". В последние дни переговоры между США и Ираном по его ядерной программе, похоже, зашли в тупик. CBS также сообщила поздно вечером в среду, что официальные лица США были проинформированы о том, что Израиль \"полностью готов\" начать атаку на Иран, и Вашингтон \"ожидает\", что Тегеран может нанести ответный удар, нацелившись на \"определенные американские объекты в соседнем Ираке\". New York Times тем временем сообщил: со ссылкой на высокопоставленного иранского чиновника сообщила, что Иран разработал план ответного удара с использованием \"сотен баллистических ракет\" в случае атаки со стороны Израиля.\nКогда появились сообщения о том, что сотрудники посольства США и их семьи покидают регион Ближнего Востока, миссия Ирана при ООН написала в социальных сетях, что \"Иран не стремится к ядерному оружию, а милитаризм США только подпитывает нестабильность\". \"Угрозы подавляющей силы не изменят фактов\", - заявили в иранской миссии. \"Дипломатия, а не милитаризм, является единственным путем вперед\", - говорится в заявлении, которое цитирует Al-Jazeera.\nМинистр обороны Ирана генерал Азиз Насирзаде ранее заявил журналистам, что надеется на успех переговоров с США, дав понять, что Тегеран готов ответить на любую агрессию. \"Если конфликт будет навязан нам, потери противника, безусловно, будут больше, чем наши, и в этом случае Америка должна уйти из региона, потому что все ее базы находятся в пределах нашей досягаемости\", - сказал он. Согласно сообщениям, шестой раунд переговоров между США и Ираном об ограничениях ядерной программы Тегерана в обмен на снятие санкций предварительно запланирован на эти выходные в Омане, и посланник Трампа на Ближнем Востоке Стив Уиткофф все еще планирует принять в нем участие.",
