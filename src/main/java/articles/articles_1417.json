    "text": "'For decades, America's health care networks have been overdue for a high tech upgrade, and that's what we're doing,' president says US President Donald Trump launched a new initiative Wednesday being dubbed the \"digital health tech ecosystem\" for Americans to upload their medical records to apps run by private tech companies with the promise of helping people access their health records.\nTrump made the announcement at a formal White House event attended by senior officials and representatives of major tech firms including Apple, Google and Amazon.\n\"For decades, America's health care networks have been overdue for a high tech upgrade, and that's what we're doing. The existing systems are often slow, costly and incompatible with one another, but with today's announcement, we take a major step to bring health care into the digital age, something that is absolutely vital,\" he said.\n\"Today, the dream of easily transportable electronic medical records finally becomes a reality,\" he added.\nDetails on the new system remain scarce, but Trump said it will be \"opt-in,\" meaning users would have to choose to participate, and he said he made a \"key breakthrough\" with 60 major tech companies to get them \"to agree to industry-wide standards for electronic medical records.\"\n\"This will allow patients to easily transmit information from one doctor to another, even if they're different networks and using different record keeping systems. No matter what system they use, they're all transferable,\" he said.\n# Amazon # Apple # Donald Trump # Google # medical records # tech # US",

    "text": "Xavier de Soultrait and Co-Pilot Martin Bonnet Navigated the Polaris RZR Pro R Factory to Two Stage Wins in Route to the Overall SSV T4 Category Victory\nMINNEAPOLIS , Jan. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Polaris Off Road made a triumphant return to the winner's circle at the 46th Edition of the Dakar Rally, securing the prestigious Side-by-Side Vehicle (SSV) T4 class victory in partnership with Sebastien Loeb Racing (SLR). The two-week-long race through the harsh and unforgiving terrain of Saudi Arabia was an intense, heart-pounding grind to the finish, but Xavier de Soultrait and co-pilot Martin Bonnet were more than up to the task, navigating their Polaris-engineered RZR Pro R Factory flawlessly. The duo secured two stage wins (plus the Prologue), five top three finishes and three additional top fives. Soultrait completed the grueling 4,903 mile (7,891km) race in 56H 37' 43\", finishing two and a half-minutes ahead of second place. The triumph is a testament to the combined power of the SLR team's skill and perseverance, the engineering prowess of Polaris and the superiority of the Polaris RZR Pro R Factory.\nIn the SSV class race, Soultrait established himself as a strong contender by securing the prologue win. He maintained his momentum in the first two stages, finishing fifth and second respectively and moving up to third place overall, the RZR Pro R Factory immediately establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in the unforgiving terrain of Dakar . However, stage three was a challenge for Soultrait and Bonnet, finishing 10th and dropping to the eighth position. From then on, Soultrait set his intentions firmly on navigating a relentless climb to the top, finishing third in stage four and securing his first win in stage five, moving him up to sixth place in the general standings. After the first-ever 48-hour Chrono stage in Dakar's history, Soultrait and the Polaris RZR Pro R Factory emerged as winners from the Empty Quarter dunes, moving him up to third place overall.\nAfter a much-needed rest day, the competition resumed with stage seven, where Soultrait's consistent finishes paid off as he secured second-place, moving him to the top of the overall standings and putting him in a position to battle for the event win. With the RZR Pro R Factory consistently performing at the highest level, the French duo continued to post solid podium results, taking second in stages eight and nine to extend their lead in the overall rankings to just over 28 minutes in their SLR RZR Pro R Factory. As the competition entered its final days, Soultrait and his partner drove conservatively during stage 10 to finish sixth. Unfortunately, Soultrait was given a 10-minute penalty during stage 11, but his fourth-place finish on the day was enough to maintain the lead, setting up a fight to the finish with only a few minutes separating him from second place. During the 12th and final stage of the event, the duo focused on driving smart and consistent to take the checkered flag in fourth and securing the monumental win.\nBased on the revolutionary RZR Pro R platform, the all-new RZR Pro R Factory was unveiled last year as the centerpiece for the Polaris Factory Racing team, setting a new precedent within the UTV industry with its race-ready level of power, strength, and control. Utilizing a high-strength, lightweight chassis compliant with FIA T4 Class, a race-tuned ProStar Fury 2.0L engine, FOX® Factory Race ESC EVO 3.0 Internal Bypass shocks, the two SLR RZR Pro R Factory vehicles showcased their pure strength and capabilities by rising to the intensive demands of the nearly 5,000-mile event through the brutal terrain of Saudi Arabia . While the platform was modified specifically for international rally racing, the RZR Pro R Factory still utilized many OEM components like the engine, driveline and suspension components as the stock RZR Pro R consumers can purchase on any dealership floor.\n\"To continue the momentum after our overall UTV victory at the Baja 1000 by starting to start the 2024 season off with a coveted Dakar Rally win alongside the Sebastien Loeb Racing team is an achievement nothing short of magnificent and something the Polaris team is incredibly proud of,\" said Alex Scheuerell , Polaris Factory Racing Technical Director. \"These landmark victories are the ultimate validation for the RZR Pro R Factory platform and its unmatched performance, strength and control. While it did come down to the wire, Xavier and Martin demonstrated an incredible level of consistency throughout the entire race, pushing themselves and the vehicle when necessary, but also knowing when to take care of the vehicle with a smoother, more conservative pace. We are incredibly proud of the entire SLR team, and we look forward to what the future holds for our racing program with them. I would also like to thank the Polaris Factory Racing Team and the entire RZR engineering group at Polaris that developed this amazing RZR Pro R Factory platform to work from.\"\n\"It's truly the culmination of a dream,\" said Xavier de Soultrait, SLR pilot and Dakar winner. \"It's hard for me to believe that we won this Dakar. I think we raced intelligently, we put pressure on, but we never overdrove. It was our first race with this new Polaris RZR Pro R Factory, and frankly, we couldn't have asked for better. I am very happy to have shared this with Martin, we really made a great team, and I of course want to thank the entire Loeb Racing and Polaris Factory Racing team who prepared a perfect car for us; this victory is the fruition of all the teams' efforts! It is also thanks to all our partners that we were able to achieve this.\"\nAdding to Polaris' success, SLR teammate Florent Vayassade who was also behind the wheel of a Polaris RZR Pro R Factory finished the grueling 12-stage event with a top 10 overall finish, highlighted by an impressive win in stage 12, plus two top fives and four additional top 10 results.\nTo learn more, please visit Polaris.com/RZR or join the conversation and follow on Facebook sm , Instagram sm , YouTube sm and X sm .

    "title": "Affirm's Stock Quintupled This Year, Beating All Tech Peers, On Buy Now, Pay Later Boom - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "Drew Angerer \\/ Getty Images A year ago, there was little holiday cheer at Affirm. The point-of-sale lender was confronting rising interest rates, recession fears and weakening consumer spending. Affirm shares ended 2022 down 90%, wiping out billions of dollars in market value.Affirm investors are wrapping up 2023 in a much different mood.The stock skyrocketed 430% in 2023, as of Wednesday's close, outperforming all other U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more. The next-best performer was Coinbase, which shot up 423% largely because of bitcoin's rebound.With the Federal Reserve setting the stage for interest rate cuts in the year ahead and more retailers signing onto Affirm's buy now, pay later offerings, or BNPL, fear of a doomsday scenario for the company has faded. Shares of Affirm got a big boost in November after the company inked an expanded partnership with Amazon, and BNPL purchases hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.\"The expectation was the consumer was going to be toast, unemployment was going to pick up and higher interest rates would destroy everything, and the exact opposite has happened on all fronts,\" said Tom Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital, which doesn't have a position in the stock. \"So that's why you have a scenario where Affirm can start to perform.\"Created in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm is competing with companies including Klarna, Block's Afterpay and Zip in the burgeoning BNPL market. Shoppers who choose to pay with a BNPL service split their purchase into four or more installments typically over a period of three months to a year, without accruing compounding interest. The lenders make money from interest payments and by charging merchants fees to offer their lending services.Retailers benefit by giving consumers another option for purchasing a skateboard, watch or a gift for a family member, and one that can come with less sticker shock, resulting in fewer abandoned carts.Affirm's run-upAffirm made its public market debut on the Nasdaq in January 2021, as the Covid-19 pandemic was driving a surge in adoption of BNPL services. Shoppers flush with stimulus checks used the small loans when buying clothes, electronics and Peloton exercise bikes, which at one point accounted for 30% of Affirm's revenue. Online storefronts rushed to add BNPL as an option at checkout.But by early 2022, Affirm's share price had fallen more than 60% from its 2021 peak. The rest of the year was just as gloomy as soaring interest rates made it more expensive for Affirm to borrow money to fund installment loans. In February 2023, Affirm cut 19% of its workforce, and executives said macro headwinds and \"negative consumer sentiment\" would likely persist for the remainder of the fiscal year.As it turns out, they were overly bearish.Affirm shares started climbing higher in August after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. The company picked up new merchant deals in sectors beyond retail, such as travel, wireless, ticketing and health care. The stock has more than doubled in the fourth quarter, boosted by an announcement last week that Affirm would offer BNPL loans at Walmart's self-checkout kiosks.Even with their dramatic bounce back, Affirm shares are about 70% below their high in November 2021.Heading into 2024, BNPL lenders face cooling inflation and an optimistic interest rate environment.Dan Dolev, managing director at Mizuho Securities, said Affirm is in a strong position to retain users. He pointed to new merchant deals and the expanding market for BNPL offerings in physical stores. Affirm says 16.9 million people have used its services, and the company counts more than 266,000 merchant partners.Affirm is eyeing international expansion and has launched a debit card that lets customers pay upfront or in installments. Affirm announced at its investor day last month that it plans to introduce a spending account tied to its debit card that will allow for ATM access and direct deposit capability.\"The next year or two years are going to be something very different,\" said Dolev, who has a buy rating on Affirm shares. \"Now they've got the brand, and what are they going to do with it? They're going to turn it into a full-fledged financial services firm.\"'David against Goliath'Hayes sees more cause for skepticism. He said Affirm faces an \"uphill battle\" competing with entrenched operators such as PayPal and Block, as well as credit card companies such as American Express, Citi and Chase that have jumped into installment loans.\"It's David against Goliath, and Goliath is going to win,\" Hayes said.Hayes said Affirm is going down a similar path to online lender SoFi, trying to \"have a thousand different projects, and say we're as big as JPMorgan, but at the end of the day, it's just simply not going to work.\"BNPL lenders also face heightened risk of users failing to make payments on time. A March report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found BNPL users were on average more likely to have higher levels of credit card debt. BNPL borrowers also tend to have lower credit scores, the CFPB said, with an average score in the subprime range of 580 to 669.The Affirm website home screen is displayed on a laptop in an arranged photograph taken in Little Falls, New Jersey, on Dec. 9, 2020.Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn Affirm spokesperson didn't provide a comment for this story but pointed to past comments from company executives.\"As our network grows, our moats get deeper,\" Levchin said at the company's investor forum in November. \"We get more data. We underwrite more transactions. We meet more people.\"Affirm's defaults remain low by industry standards. Average delinquency rates for peers, such as LendingClub, SoFi, Upstart and OneMain Financial, increased from 5.7% to 6.3% between January and November, while Affirm's delinquency rate fell from 2.8% to 2.6%, Jefferies analysts wrote in a report last month.Affirm says it bases loan decisions on a variety of data points in addition to a user's credit score.\"Our process involves looking at credit report data, but could also involve some Affirm-specific stuff, like what we know about the merchant and the thing they are about to sell you,\" Levchin said in a release last year.As BNPL adoption grows, regulators are keeping a close eye on the space. Last week, three U.S. senators penned a letter to the CFPB urging the agency to monitor the uptick in BNPL usage during the holidays, saying it could leave consumers overextended. The CFPB announced in September 2022 that it would subject BNPL to greater oversight, in line with credit card companies.Wells Fargo issued a report earlier this month that described BNPL loans as \"phantom debt\" that may be lulling \"consumers into a false security in which many small payments add up to one big problem.\" As it stands today, the industry is \"not a major problem for consumer spending yet,\" Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Seery Grein wrote.Since BNPL loans are not currently reported to major credit reporting agencies, they wrote, there is \"no way to know when this phantom debt could create substantial problems for the consumer and the broader economy.\"WATCH: Payments trends for 2024Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO: Checkout latest world news below links : World News || Latest News || U.S. News Source link",
