    "title": "Orlando D. Lilly Sworn In As New Superintendent Of Natural Resources Police",
    "text": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. – The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) formally welcomed Orlando D. Lilly as the 11th Superintendent of the Maryland Natural Resources Police on Wednesday. The former Baltimore County Police Major and Navy veteran was sworn in at DNR headquarters in Annapolis. Lilly assumes the rank of Colonel. Lilly, 55, takes over the post most recently held by Col. Adrian Baker, who retired in January 2023. Acting Lieutenant Colonel Brian Rathgeb has served in the acting Deputy Superintendent position since July 2023. “Col. Lilly has gone above and beyond throughout his law enforcement career, building a legacy of dedication and professionalism,” Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said. “We know that with Col. Lilly at the helm, the Maryland Natural Resources Police will be in good hands. His commitment to equitable policing, community-building, and leadership will ensure Natural Resources Police officers continue to effectively serve Marylanders through fair and equitable enforcement of the state’s natural resource laws.” “We are very appreciative of Acting Lt. Col. Brian Rathgeb’s service and leadership during the previous months,” added Kurtz. “His guidance was invaluable and we are extremely proud and fortunate to have him as a part of our leadership team.” Lilly has 29 years of experience in law enforcement, including serving in several leadership positions with the Baltimore County Police Department. Most recently, Lilly was a Major in the Western Patrol Division at the department, where he was assigned to the Operations Bureau. He holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from the University of Baltimore and a master’s degree in management from Johns Hopkins University. Lilly has also served in various positions outside of the Baltimore County Police Department. He has been a member of several advisory boards, including the Baltimore County Work Group on Equitable Policing and the Baltimore County Government’s New Americans Task Force. Lilly also developed the curriculum and taught math application in law enforcement for 17 years in the Forensic Science Department at the University of Baltimore. “I’m excited to join the Maryland Natural Resources Police and look forward to the unique task of protecting Maryland’s natural resources,” Lilly said. “I want to thank Gov. Moore and Secretary Kurtz for providing me with this opportunity. My goal in this new role will be to ensure Natural Resources Police continue to provide excellent conservation enforcement, while also working closely with the communities we serve to understand how we can better address their needs.” A beacon in community policing, Lilly’s actions to strengthen the bond between the police and the citizens they serve has been evident throughout his career. Lilly hosted routine community events during his time with the Baltimore County Police Department, including basketball clinics, community walks, “Coffee with a Cop,” National Night Out, and many other community-building events. He intends to bring that ethic of service to the community to Natural Resources Police. Growing up in central North Carolina, Lilly developed a passion for the outdoors from his father, who was an avid hunter and fisherman. Working alongside conservation officers in Baltimore County showed him that police work can reach a wide variety of people and communities. Lilly worked his way up through the ranks during his tenure at the Baltimore County Police Department. He started his law enforcement career as an entry-level officer in 1994 after his service in the U.S. Navy aboard the USS Shreveport (LPD-12). Most recently, Lilly oversaw five of Baltimore County’s 10 precincts. An Albemarle, North Carolina native, Lilly first gained interest in the Baltimore County Police Department through a North Carolina Central University college class focused on Cornelius “Neil” Behan. Behan served as Baltimore County’s Chief of Police from 1977 to 1994 and was nationally renowned for his work in adapting and implementing community-based policing practices. Lilly and his wife, Angelica, reside in Ellicott City. They have two children. The Natural Resources Police comprises 258 officers and a dedicated staff of civilian and volunteer personnel, including reserve and retired officers. The agency is responsible for enforcing conservation and boating safety laws, protecting state parks, public lands, and waterways.",

    "text": "El Barça de balonmano volverá a la competición la próxima semana en la Copa de España de Lanzarote (8-9 de febrero), el torneo que reúne a los cuatro primeros clasificados al final de la primera vuelta.\nEl equipo de Carlos Ortega será un año más el favorito al título: el Bidasoa Irún será su rival en semifinales al tiempo que el Bathco Torrelavega y el Fraikin BM Granollers se jugarán la otra plaza en la final.\nEl Barça jugó su último partido oficial el pasado 20 de diciembre, cuando ganó al REBI Cuenca (35-26) para cerrar la primera vuelta de la Liga ASOBAL como líder con pleno de 15 victorias y 30 puntos. Los azulgrana también van primeros en el grupo B de la Champions y tienen encarrilado su pase directo a cuartos de final.\nHasta 12 jugadores del Barça se fueron después con sus selecciones al Mundial de Croacia, Dinamarca y Noruega, que ha parado en enero las competiciones de clubs y concluirá el domingo con la final: Croacia-Francia y Dinamarca-Portugal son las semifinales.\nCon ese telón de fondo, el Barça ha jugado este jueves un amistoso en Sant Joan Despí contra el Bada Huesca para empezar a preparar la Copa de España, aunque Ortega sólo ha contado con cuatro jugadores del primer equipo, Tim N'Guessan, Pol Valera, Aitor Ariño y Aleix Gómez, que ha entrado en la lista como parte de su proceso de recuperación aunque aún no tenga el alta médica, según ha explicado el club.\nEl Barça, por tanto, ha completado la convocatoria con 12 jóvenes del filial y el juvenil, seis de ellos debutantes en el primer equipo, Mikael Lopes, Guido Bayo, Quim Rocas, Oriol San Felipe, Hannes Holting y Adriàn Sola.\nEl Barça, que tenía el principal objetivo de coger ritmo después de un mes largo sin jugar, ha perdido por un gol en un final ajustado (31-32) contra el Bada Huesca, actual colista de la Liga ASOBAL con sólo cinco puntos tras dos victorias, un empate y 12 derrotas en la primera vuelta.\nPor otra parte, los siete azulgrana cuyas selecciones quedaron fuera del Mundial después de la segunda fase han vuelto también este jueves a los entrenamientos: Gonzalo Pérez de Vargas, Javi Rodríguez, Petar Cikusa, Blaz Janc, Domen Makuc, Jonathan Carlsbogard y Hampus Wanne han hecho una sesión física en la Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper.\nDika Mem (Francia), Melvyn Richardson (Francia), Emil Nielsen (Dinamarca) y Luis Frade (Portugal) siguen en liza en las semifinales del Mundial, mientras que Thiagus Petrus (Brasil) quedó eliminado en cuartos de final.",

    "text": "A five-year-old girl seriously injured in an attack outside a Dublin school is out of danger, her mother has said. Through a message on a GoFundMe page, the child’s mother gave an update, saying the youngster is “more alert” and has smiled. She said: “Just to wish everyone a delayed Christmas and a happy new year. “Our angel has been out of the PICU (paediatric intensive care unit) for two weeks now. She is more alert and even smiled. “We still have a long time in hospital, but she is out of danger. Thank you everyone for all the help and support.” A number of people were hurt in the attack in Parnell Square East on November 23. The five-year-old girl and a creche worker are still receiving treatment for their injuries in hospital. Another girl, six, and a boy, five, were also treated in hospital but later discharged. A riot in Dublin city centre followed the attack, which led to a man being charged and put before a Dublin court. Riad Bouchaker, of no fixed address, is accused of trying to murder the two girls and boy. He is also charged with the assault causing serious harm to a care worker. He is further charged with three counts of assault causing harm and the possession and production of a 36cm kitchen knife.

    "title": "Reports: Delaware State hires DeSean Jackson as head coach",
    "text": "Longtime NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson will take over as head coach at Delaware State, Victory Formation Media and ESPN reported Thursday. If confirmed, it would be the latest data point in a growing trend of FCS football teams hiring well-known former players -- with little to no prior coaching experience -- in an effort to stand out. Jackson, 38, has no connection to Delaware State but according to ESPN, \"it has always been a dream\" of his to coach at an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities). Earlier this month, Norfolk State hired Michael Vick to take over the Spartans' program. Vick, who also reportedly heard from Sacramento State, hails from the Norfolk, Va., area. Norfolk State is one of Delaware State's rivals in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. Colorado coach Deion Sanders spent three seasons (2020-22) as the head coach of Jackson State before moving up to the FBS level. His only prior coaching experience came at the high school level, including at his own short-lived charter school in Texas, \"Prime Prep Academy.\" Jackson last played for the Baltimore Ravens in 2022. He is best known for two stints with the Philadelphia Eagles (2008-13, 2019-20) and played for a total of six teams in a 15-year NFL career. Jackson caught 641 passes for 11,263 yards and 58 touchdowns, adding four rushing touchdowns and four punt return touchdowns in 183 career games. Delaware State went 1-11 in 2024 (0-5 MEAC) and fired coach Lee Hull after the season. The Hornets have not had a winning season since going 6-5 in 2012. --Field Level Media\nReports: Delaware State hires DeSean Jackson as head coach\n- Field Level Media\n[0](/around_the_web/sports/reports-delaware-state-hires-desean-jackson-as-head-coach/article_d6c074b8-bc94-5007-a66b-a7f0399dee22.html#comments)\n[Load comments]\nPost a comment as anonymous\nReport\nWatch this discussion.

WXCharts shows a large band of snow covering England from the south to north coast on Tuesday, January 7.\nA 351-mile wall of snow is predicted to blanket parts of the country at 6pm on Tuesday, as per weather maps from WXCharts. Parts of West and South Yorkshire could see up to 10.75cm (4.2in) of snowfall per hour by 6pm that day, according to WXCharts.com.\nHowever, parts of Shropshire could witness up to 16.07cm (6in) of snow an hour at 3pm on Tuesday. The snow band will continue its eastward sweep across England, with the weather expected to clear by 12pm on Wednesday, January 8.\nYet, temperatures are set to plummet at 6am on Thursday morning, January 9, with households waking up to freezing conditions. Parts of south west England could experience temperatures of -6C, while in the north of England, it could fall to as low as -7C.\nThis comes as the UK is currently experiencing a January cold snap. Yellow warnings for snow and ice have been issued for northern parts of the country today, reports Birmingham Live .\nMeanwhile, a 45-hour snow warning is in place across large parts of England and Wales over the weekend. The yellow weather alert has been issued for between 12pm on Saturday, January 4, and 9am Monday, January 6.\nThe Met Office has issued a warning about potential travel disruptions due to the incoming wintry weather, which could affect roads and railways and even lead to power cuts. They stated: \"Outbreaks of rain spreading north-eastwards later on Saturday and overnight into Sunday will likely be preceded by a spell of snow on its northern flank.\n\"Whilst there is a fair bit of uncertainty as to how far north this may spread, and how long any snow will last, significant accumulations of snow are possible, especially (but not exclusively) on hills.\n\"Currently, parts of the Midlands, Wales and northern England are most at risk of disruption, where 5cm or more could accumulate fairly widely, with perhaps as much as 20-30cm over high ground of Wales and/or the Pennines. This, accompanied by strengthening winds, may lead to drifting of lying snow.\"\nA large band of snow could sweep parts of the UK on Tuesday (Image: WX Charts)\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

    "text": "Shortly into the profile, Ritchson tells the interviewer that “mental health is an everyday conversation for me,” something that anyone living with mental illness can relate to on a cellular level. But he immediately follows by saying he texts his psychiatrist each day to check in, and on the day of the interview texted her, “I’m great!” Her response was, “Are you really? Too great?” If you’re someone with bipolar disorder, this is instantly relatable. Most people have a general understanding of bipolar disorder — the periods of severe depression juxtaposed with periods of overwhelming mania. At my most manic, I certainly feel “good,” but it’s the type of “good” that makes me feel invincible when in reality I am on the verge of crashing at any second.\nThe world is accustomed to people who look like me ( fat white girl with colored hair aNd PrOnOuNs ) talking about mental illness, which makes it a hell of a lot easier for people to ignore whatever I have to say. But when it comes from Alan Ritchson? The guy who plays Jack Reacher? The guy who played a scene where he was stabbed in the forearm and kept punching a dude as if nothing happened? When that guy talks about mental health, people listen, possibly for the first time.\nBut his diagnosable conditions like bipolar disorder and ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) aren’t the only areas Ritchson is willing to get forthright about. Throughout the interview, he speaks about his past self-destructive habits, his body image insecurities, surviving sexual abuse in the workplace during his time as a model, and his history of suicidal ideation. The rate of male suicide is nearly 4x that of women, and a large part of it is because men aren’t given the space or grace to talk about their emotions. Seeing someone like Alan Ritchson — who looks like a drawing of an “alpha male” come to life — talk about these issues could be sincerely life-saving.\nSource link",

    "text": "Melbourne, Australia-based medical device company Epiminder—which has its U.S. headquarters in Dallas—has been granted FDA authorization via the De Novo classification for Minder, the company’s proprietary implantable continuous electroencephalogram monitoring system (iCEMTM) for patients with epilepsy.\nMinder has also been designated as a Breakthrough Technology by the FDA, recognizing its potential to provide more effective diagnosis and management for people living with epilepsy. Epiminder said this De Novo authorization is “significant” as it creates a new classification of device that underscores both the innovation and the clinical validation behind Minder.\nThe company said the safety and effectiveness of Minder was validated through Epiminder’s UMPIRE clinical study, a multi-center comparator trial held in leading Australian hospitals between 2019 and 2023. The results of UMPIRE were used to support Epiminder’s successful FDA application\n“By extending the monitoring window of an EEG from days using current technologies to months or even years with Minder, we can deliver unprecedented access to a high-fidelity stream of continuous EEG data to health care professionals and their patients,” Epiminder CEO Rohan Hoare said in a statement. “The FDA’s clearance of Minder is a significant milestone for Epiminder and more importantly for the 52 million people around the world who have epilepsy.”\n“As the first and only implantable continuous EEG monitor approved in the U.S., Minder can provide health care professionals and their patients with more accurate and timely diagnoses, enhanced therapeutic drug monitoring, and can better inform decisions on non-drug treatments like surgery,” Hoare added. “Looking ahead, Epiminder plans to develop a suite of integrated software solutions that will extend the clinical impact of the Minder device, for example by providing patients with advance notice of seizures through AI-enabled forecasting.”\nImproved seizure tracking and management The company said that without accurate diagnosis and monitoring, “sustained and effective management of epilepsy can be challenging.” Minder was developed to address the shortcomings in current electroencephalogram (EEG) technologies, providing reliable and actionable diagnostic data for more patients and therefore better enabling their prospects for successful epilepsy treatment, the company said.\nEpiminder intends to launch Minder in the U.S. this year via “a phased commercial rollout into leading epilepsy centers,” as part of a program to demonstrate the clinical utility of the system.\n“One of the greatest difficulties in caring for people with epilepsy is the lack of accurate information about a patient’s seizures. Seizure diaries are of limited effectiveness,” Prof. Robert Fisher, director of the Stanford Epilepsy Center, past-president of the American Epilepsy Society, and chair of the Data Safety Monitoring Board for the UMPIRE trial, said in a statement. “Minder can greatly improve seizure tracking and therefore seizure management. It will fill the significant gap in current EEG technologies, providing clinicians like me continuous and accurate data.”\nFisher noted that the data leads to a more complete picture and more precise diagnoses.\nThe end result is that physicians are “better able to rapidly adjust medication or neuromodulation regimens and identify patients for potential non-drug or surgical treatments. The result will be a reduction in the huge burden of drug resistant epilepsy,” he said.\nTrial results ‘exceeded our expectations’ Prof. Mark Cook, MD, of London, Epiminder’s founder and chief medical officer, said, “The results from UMPIRE exceeded our expectations and demonstrated Minder’s ability to capture high-quality EEG data continuously for extended periods, including a groundbreaking five-year continuous recording in one participant. Minder delivered actionable clinical insights for nearly 90% of study participants, highlighting the real-life benefits that Epiminder’s best-in-class iCEM can deliver relative to the current standard of care.”\nEpiminder said that epilepsy is one of the most common serious chronic neurological disorders and affects roughly 52 million people worldwide including 3.4 million Americans. It is a neurological condition where a person experiences recurrent seizures caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\nSeizures can present with a variety of clinical manifestations; some involve motor symptoms, such as intense muscle contractions, while others, such as absence or focal impaired awareness seizures, may present with subtle or no outward physical signs. Epiminder noted that occurrence of seizures varies in frequency among patients, from less than one a year to several a day.",
