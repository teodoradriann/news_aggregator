    "title": "Martin Short Jokes, Donald Trump Did Not Meet the ONE Expectation Melania Trump had in Their Marriage",
    "text": "Martin Short Jokes, Donald Trump Did Not Meet the ONE Expectation Melania Trump had in Their Marriage\nLate-night shows are popular for comedic takes on\nDonald Trump, who is often the subject of monologues and sketches. There are also several jabs aimed at his wife, Melania Trump. During a recent episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Martin Short once again took up hosting duties for the show host, Jimmy Kimmel.\nHe brought humor into the conversation by speculating about Melania's expectations when she married Donald. As reported by\nDecider, this moment depicts how late-night TV continues to navigate the political landscape humorously.\nShort said, \"The producers are saying it's time for my contractually obligated Jimmy Kimmel Live! Trump jokes. It's apparently a must around here.\" As reported by\nNewsweek, he continued, \"There are reports that if Trump gets reelected, Melania might not live in the White House with him.\nApparently, Melania hated her time in Washington, but she still might come to D.C. for state dinners and official events. Yes, that's when she really comes alive.\" Here, he was referring to a recent statement made by the author of First Women and various other books centered around the White House. Talking about Melania, Brower said, \"She's distancing herself even more from her husband and from the Washington social-political scene.\"\nBower also added, \"I mean, she clearly hated being in Washington.\" Short then proceeded to show a photograph of the Trumps seated together at a formal event, with Melania looking quite serious.\nHe said, “I actually have a little empathy for Melania. I mean, she entered this marriage, she had a certain expectation, and that expectation was that the average life expectancy for an American male is 76.3 years old.” Age has been a significant topic of discussion in this election cycle, not only concerning Donald but also including\nJoe Biden.\nShort further said, \"Maybe if Trump wins, Melania can just move to Canada because, according to the story I saw today, there are plenty of Trump-like con artists up there, too.\" Other First Ladies have also chosen not to reside in the White House.\nShort jokingly said, “Almost every First Lady has lived in the White House with her husband expect for Nancy Reagan, who spent most of the 80s shacked up with Mr. T.\" At some point during the show, Short also made a jest about the age-related concerns surrounding both Donald and Biden.\nAs reported by\nSalon, he said, “He’s something, that Trump. He says he wants them both to submit to a drug test before the debate. Do you have any idea how long it takes to get a urine sample from men who are close to 80? I’m 74, and the only time I don’t have to pee is when I’m peeing.”\nMeanwhile, Kimmel recently criticized a Father's Day message that Donald posted. The message read, “Happy Father’s Day to all, including the radical left degenerates that are rapidly bringing the United States of America into third-world nation status.” Kimmel said, “Who’s mad on Father’s Day? I guess you’d be mad if there was a whole day devoted to your two biggest failures, Trippy and Dopey.”",

    "text": "A Ukrainian teenager whose home was destroyed during the war against Russia has had his residence rebuilt after he was featured in an Imagine Dragons video. The music video for Crushed showed the wreckage of Sasha's village after it was under occupation for five months. His home and other buildings in the town were completely destroyed. Sasha survived the devastation by hiding in an underground bunker, but his neighbors did not live. The band ultimately helped bring Sasha's story to the attention of an organization that decided to rebuild his home. Video released by United24, the fundraising platform behind the rebuilding efforts, captures the moment Sasha enters the home for the first time. The tear-jerking video showed Sasha and his family moving into the new home, and described how the rebuilding came to be. A post shared by UNITED24 (@u24.gov.ua) Ukrainian teenager Sasha has had his home rebuilt after he was featured in the Imagine Dragons video Crushed Sasha and his family - pictured beside their new home - lost their family during the war against Russia 'A year ago, Imagine Dragons director of photography and frequent collaborator Ty Arnold came to Ukraine as a volunteer,' the video explained. 'In the village of Mykolaiv Oblast, which suffered devastating Russian attacks, he met 14-year-old Sashko. 'Sashko's home and village were completely destroyed, and Ty documented his story. 'Moved by the footage, Imagine Dragons featured Sashko in their official music video for Crushed. 'The musicians invited Sashko to their concert in Warsaw, where they met in person. 'This video helped the world see the horrors of war unleashed by Russia. 'And millions learned about Sashko's biggest dream - to come back home. 'That night, representatives of the UNITED24 partners, Aurora retail chain, was in the audience. The tear-jerking video shows Sasha standing beside the wreckage and his newly-constructed home The home was rebuilt by United24, Ukraine's official fundraising platform Sasha shown sitting by candlelight in his old home compared to an image of him in his brand new bedroom Sasha seen entering the keys to his new home Him and his family enter their brand new home The band helped bring Sasha's story to the attention of an organization that rebuilt his home 'The company decided to rebuild Sashko's home from scratch. 'After six months of work, Sashko opens the door to his brand new home for the first time.' Sasha is then shown receiving a video message from the band, who tell him: 'We are so incredibly proud of you. You have inspired us, you've inspired thousands of people across the globe. 'Thank you to all the incredible donors who made this dog. And above all, Sasha, welcome home.' Sasha receives a video message from the band after he entered his new home The poignant video shows the construction of Sasha's home, and moving side-by-side images comparing his destroyed home to his new one. In one photo, Sasha sat in his ruined home by candlelight. But in the newer image, Sasha sat in his brightly lit bedroom with a brand new desk and computer nearby. Imagine Dragons posted the video to their account with the caption: 'One year ago, our friend @ty__arnold met a 14 year old boy named Sashko in Ukraine. He was wandering the streets of his destroyed town of Novohryhorivka, still in disbelief of the complete destruction of his home, his neighborhood, and his school. '@ty__arnold captured Sashko’s story in our music video for Crushed. Thanks to UNITED24 (which we support) and their donor @avrora.multimarket , Sashko and his mother’s house has been rebuilt. UNITED24 was set up by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the main platform for collecting charitable donations in support of Ukraine. Last week the organization released video of Ukranian soldiers on war-weary frontlines in Bakhmut singing modified versions of Christmas classics including Happy Xmas (War Is Over), Let It Snow and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. The covers include changed lyrics 'designed to remind people about the ongoing war and the importance of global support for Ukraine', according to the UNITED24 fundraising platform behind the campaign.",

    "text": "«En toute sincérité, les conditions de cette visite ne sont pas idoines», a déclaré M. Attaf dans un entretien accordé mercredi soir à Atheer, la plateforme de la chaine qatarie Al Jazeera.\nM. Attaf a énuméré les dossiers de la mémoire, la mobilité, la coopération économique, les essais nucléaires français dans le Sahara algérien et celui de la restitution de l’épée ainsi que le burnous de l’émir Abdelkader.\nAlors même que «le président devait se rendre au Château d’Amboise où était emprisonné l’Émir Abdelkader (...) les autorités françaises ont refusé (de restituer l’épée et le burnous de l’Emir) arguant la nécessité d’une loi» , a indiqué le ministre.\nConcernant les essais nucléaires français, M. Attaf a indiqué que l’Algérie demandait «une reconnaissance des dommages causés» ainsi que «des indemnisations».\nLire aussi : Algérie: le patron de l’armée en visite officielle en France pour préparer celle de Tebboune\nEntre 1960 et 1966, la France a procédé à 17 essais nucléaires sur les sites de Reggane, puis d’In Ekker, dans le Sahara algérien.\nDe documents déclassifiés en 2013 ont révélé des retombées radioactives importantes qui s’étendaient de l’Afrique de l’Ouest au sud de l’Europe.\n«Nous ne sommes pas parvenus à des accords sur cinq grands et lourds dossiers. Mais nous continuons à travailler dessus», a réitéré le ministre en soulignant que les visites entre les responsables des deux pays se poursuivent pour préparer cette visite d’Etat.\nLire aussi : \"Seuls les visas intéressent l'Algérie dans la relation avec la France\", selon l'ex-ambassadeur de Paris à Alger\nDébut août, le président algérien Abdelmadjid Tebboune avait déclaré que sa visite d’Etat en France était «toujours maintenue» mais dépendait «du programme» de l’Élysée, précisant qu’une «visite d’État a des conditions» et «n’est pas une visite touristique» .\nLa visite, programmée d’abord début mai, avait été repoussée à juin, les Algériens craignant qu’elle ne soit gâchée par les manifestations du 1er mai contre la très contestée réforme des retraites en France, selon des sources concordantes.\nCette visite devait consacrer l’embellie entre les deux pays après de nombreuses crises diplomatiques.\n 28/12/2023 à 19h49",

    "text": "Saber más\nMagaly Medina ha manifestado su molestia luego que Andrea Llosa presentara en su programa una entrevista exclusiva con Christian Cueva. Al respecto, la presentadora de espectáculos aseguró que su equipo estaba en contacto con el futbolista para tenerlo en su programa.\nEn entrevista con el diario Trome, la popular ‘Urraca’ señaló que Christian Cueva es un personaje para su programa, ya que el perfil de “Magaly TV, la firme” aborda temas de farándula nacional. Por ese motivo, señaló que, si el futbolista contactó a Andrea Llosa, ella debía aclarar que los temas de espectáculos los ve Magaly Medina.\n“Te juro que esa entrevista dio vergüenza ajena, ¿para eso me lo quitas? Zapatero a tus zapatos, vete con tu ADN. Era un personaje mío, veníamos negociando con él y si a ti te llamaron al Instagram y Cueva te escribió, tú le dices: Magaly es la que se encarga de espectáculos, si ella no quiere entrevistarte, yo te entrevisto”, manifestó.\nLa molestia de Magaly Medina no quedó ahí, ya que señaló que ATV le habría faltado el respeto al priorizar a Andrea antes que a ella, por lo que este año cumplirá su contrato con el canal; sin embargo, no está segura si se mantendrá en 2026 al frente de su espacio de espectáculos.\n“Te digo que esta falta de respeto del canal me ha parecido tan grande que, lógicamente, este año voy a cumplir mi contrato porque ya lo firmé antes de irme de vacaciones, pero el próximo año no lo sé. La verdad estoy muy molesta y fastidiada”, señaló.\n“ATV siempre ha sido mi casa, pero parece que hay gente en el canal que quiere mantener a Andrea, cuando es un talento que ya perdió su talento”, agregó, notablemente ofuscada.",

    "title": "How the British Media Covered the ‘Israeli Attack on the School’",
    "text": "[Order David Horowitz’s new book, America Betrayed, HERE .]\nThe performance by the British media in reporting on the Israeli strike on a Hamas command-and-control center inside a school complex is nothing short of disgraceful: “Media Promotes Hamas Propaganda In Reporting On Gaza Attack, by Adam Levick, CAMERA , August 12, 2024:\nThe Independent, in an article published on Sunday, and co-written by Bel Trew, Salma Ouaguira and Nedal Hamdouna, included this headline:\nTerror and death as Israel strikes school in Gaza during prayers…\nThis is false. The Fajr (Dawn) prayers had ended 15 minutes before the IDF attack was launched. The mosque area had emptied out.\nHere’s the strapline, which also uses the highest Hamas figure, stating it as a fact rather than an unevidenced claim:\nPalestinians describe the harrowing moment IDF targeted al-Tabaeen school in Gaza City, killing 100 people\nAgain, The Independent offers no evidence to support this maximalist claim by Hamas of “100 people killed.” It also had no reason to claim that the IDF targeted “al-Tabeen school.” The Israeli pilots did not strike a school, but a command-and-control center that Hamas had set up inside the mosque area of the school complex.\nIt’s only several paragraphs into the article that the 100 number is attributed to Hamas. Further, the IDF statement, and terrorist casualty figures, were only cited in the 11th paragraph of the article.\nMany people do not read stories beyond the headline and the first few paragraphs. How many readers of The Independent never reached the paragraph mentioning Hamas as the source of the “100 Gazans killed”? And it was not until the eleventh paragraph of the story that the source for the “100 number” was correctly attributed to Hamas, and that also noted the figures on terrorist casualties from the strike for which the IDF provided evidence — the names and photographs of those 38 dead Hamas members.\nA Guardian article on Saturday, 17:48 BST, by Bethan McKernan, told readers that at least 80 were killed, which it attributed to “Palestinian officials”.\nIsrael strikes on Gaza school site kill at least 80 , Palestinian officials say… That reference to “Palestinian officials” misleads. The Guardian should have written “Hamas officials claim that the IDF killed ‘at least 80.’” It should also have made clear that Israel did not strike a “Gaza school,” but rather, a mosque inside a school complex, parts of which were being used by Hamas as a command-and-control center, as can be inferred from the large number of Hamas combatants who were killed at the site.\nThe Guardian , always reliably anti-Israel, did not disappoint. It called the source of its information about “80 killed” Gazans a “civil defense” group, but did not make clear that this group is controlled by Hamas. The paper claims that “70 bodies” were in the morgue at Al-Ahli Hospital, as confirmed by Dr. Fadel Naeem, but says nothing about this doctor at Al-Ahli Hospital, who had been caught lying before, when he ascribed to Israel “an attack on the hospital that killed 500 civilians.” It turned out to be a missile fired at Israel from Gaza by Palestinian Islamic Jihad that misfired, and fell inside Gaza on a parking lot next to the hospital, killing not 500, but 50 civilians. The Guardian reporter chose to accept Dr. Naeem’s story, despite his record of lying.\nAs for Israel’s version of the attack, including the number, and names, of combatant casualties and its evidence that inside the school complex there was a command-and-control center, that was relegated to the ninth paragraph of the story — which means many readers will not have gotten that far in the report.\nA Telegraph article on Saturday 20:39 BST, written by their Global Health editor Paul Nuki, was better than most we reviewed, telling readers, in the headline, that “dozens” were “reportedly” killed:\nIsraeli air strike on school complex reportedly kills dozens in Gaza…\nThe Telegraph’s account is comparatively fair. The headline suggests some necessary doubt about casualties, saying only that “dozens” were “reportedly” killed. It then quotes the IDF as saying Hamas commanders and operatives were hiding in a mosque that was part of the school complex — the only major media outlet in the U.K to have done so. One caveat: it is too bad that Israel’s version doesn’t appear until the sixth paragraph, which, again, insures that many readers will not have read that far.\nA video report on Saturday at Channel 4 News, by foreign affairs correspondent Secunder Kermani, included one of the Hamas casualty count claims as fact:\nIsraeli airstrike on Gaza school kills over 70\nThe four minute broadcast includes the claims of Gaza “rescue officials” that they found over 100 bodies, and all but erases Hamas from the story….\nThere are two numbers about Gazan casualties in this video broadcast on Channel 4 News by Secunder Kermani. The first is 70 — “Israeli airstrike on Gaza school kills over 70.” This number was put out by Hamas, but is stated as fact; Hamas is never mentioned as the source. Elsewhere in the four-minute broadcast we are told that “Gaza rescue officials” have “found over 100 bodies.” We are not told that those Gaza officials are either members of Hamas or take their orders from Hamas. And what about that discrepancy between the numbers: did the Israeli airstrikes kill 70, even though 100 dead bodies have been found by “Gaza officials”? Mr. Kermani, please explain.\nAnd why does that reporter mention “over a dozen such strikes on schools” in recent months, without explaining that all of those “school” buildings were being used by terrorists to hide men, weapons, rocket launchers, and command-and-control centers, which is a war crime?",
