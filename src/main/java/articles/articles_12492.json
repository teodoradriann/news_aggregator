    "text": "COPA | REAL SOCIEDAD-RAYO (3-1)\nLa Real Sociedad elimina al Rayo y se planta en los cuartos de la Copa\nSergio Gómez celebra su gol anrte el Rayo. / EFE\nLa Real Sociedad venció este jueves al Rayo Vallecano por 3-1, un resultado que le vuelve a colocar en una buena posición para ilusionarse de nuevo con llegar lejos en la Copa del Rey. De momento, ya etsá en cuartos.\nEl partido comenzó con ritmo, con dos equipos en busca de marcar las pautas del encuentro, aunque con una Real más incisiva y controladora del balón.\nOcasiones varias en ambas áreas, como un disparo de Pedro Díaz detenido por Álex Remiro o un zurriagazo de Jon Mikel Aramburu desde lejos bien atajado por Dani Cárdenas.\nEn el minuto 23 llegó el primer gol, con un magnífico Takefusa Kubo, habilitado por un clarividente Ander Barrenetxea, que cedió para que su compañero encarase desde el lateral del área y sirviese una gran asistencia a su capitán Mikel Oyarzabal.\nA partir de ahí, los locales manejaron el encuentro a placer, con un conjunto rayista que dio un paso adelante para tratar de igualar la contienda.\nLo mejor llegó en el tiempo añadido de la primera parte, ya que Jon Ander Olasagasti amplió la renta local con un lanzamiento desde fuera del área ante el que nada pudo hacer Cárdenas.\nCon el 2-0, todo parecía de color de rosa para la Real, pero al filo del descanso Zubeldia cometió un penalti sobre Óscar Trejo que luego materializó la pena máxima.\nAl regreso de los vestuarios, el guion continuó como en la primera parte, con un Rayo que esperaba su oportunidad, mientras que la Real mostraba más ambición. Así llegó la primera ocasión del segundo tiempo, con un Aramburu que volvió a probar suerte desde fuera del área, aunque su disparo se marchó desviado.\nSuperior, el conjunto txuri urdin buscó el tercero con ahínco y, de hecho, el VAR tuvo que intervenir para anular un gol de Barrenetxea por fuera de juego previo de Oyarzabal en la cesión.\nEl gol que no pudo anular el VAR fue el que marcó de falta directa Sergio Gómez en el minuto 78 y que supuso la puntilla para los de Iñigo Pérez. Una falta que supuso la segunda amarilla para el 'Pacha' Espino.\nSin tiempo para más, los de Alguacil sacaron el billete a cuartos de final de la Copa del Rey y confirmaron un gran inicio de año.\nFicha técnica:\n3 - Real Sociedad: Remiro; Aramburu, Zubeldia, Aguerd, Aihen; Zubimendi, Olasagasti, Sucic (Brais Méndez, m.68); Kubo, Oyarzabal (Óskarsson, m82) y Barrenetxea (Sergio Gómez, m.68).\n1 - Rayo Vallecano: Cárdenas; Balliu, Aridane, Lejeune, Espino; Valentín, Pedro Díaz (Unai López, m.65), Trejo (Isi, m.65); Álvaro García (Chavarría, m.82), Nteka (Camello, m.72) y De Frutos (Embarba, m.65).\nGoles: 1-0, m.23: Oyarzabal; 2-0, m.46+: Olasagasti; 2-1, m.51+: Trejo (penalti); 3-1, m.78: Sergio Gómez.\nÁrbitro: Francisco José Hernández Maeso (Comité Extremeño). Amonestó a Zubimendi (44) por la Real Sociedad y a Lejeune (59) e Isi (82) por el Rayo Vallecano. Expulsó por doble amarilla a Espino (17 y 77).\nIncidencias: Encuentro correspondiente a los octavos de final de la Copa del Rey disputado en el Reale Arena ante 27.816 espectadores.",

    "text": "Ramanujam Receives $10.4 Million to Improve Existing Treatments for Breast Cancer Michaela Martinez With the support from the Department of Defense’s 2024 Innovator Award, Nimmi Ramanujam and an interdisciplinary team of researchers aim to improve the detection and treatment of early-stage breast cancer Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr. Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering, received the 2024 Innovator Award from the Department of Defense’s Breast Cancer Research Program. Intended to support the work of researchers who have demonstrated exceptional creativity, innovative work and paradigm-shifting leadership, the award provides more than $10.4 million in funding for four years. When Ramanujam founded the Center for Global Women’s Health Technologies (GWHT) at Duke in 2013, her goals were clear: pursue work that helps eliminate mortality from cervical and breast cancer by making diagnosis and treatment more accessible for women around the world. It’s safe to say her work has been impactful. In the decade since the center’s founding, Ramanujam, the GWHT director, and her collaborators created the Pocket Colposcope and the Callascope, both intended to increase access to early detection of cervical cancer in resource-limited settings. These tools enable more than 95 percent of women to receive proper care in midwife-run community clinics. With the support from the DoD’s Breast Cancer Research Program, Ramanujam and her team hope to make similar strides to address early-stage breast cancer. Breast cancer accounts for roughly 30 percent of all new female cancers in the United States each year, and accounts for nearly a quarter of all cancers in women worldwide. The chance of a woman in the US being diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime is about 1 in 8 today. “Until we have a vaccine, the diagnosis and treatment of early-stage disease is the shortest path to elimination. We are at a point where we know quite a bit about the tumor microenvironment and how tumor cells escape therapy and ultimately recur. Our goal is to leverage both the behavior of the tumor and its microenvironment to create technologies that can slow down or stop breast cancer from evolving into a lethal disease.” Nimmi Ramanujam, Robert W. Carr, Jr. Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering To accomplish this, Ramanujam will work with Brian Crouch and Megan Madonna, both assistant research professors in Duke BME, and Marlee Krieger, the executive director of GWHT to pursue three projects to improve the detection and treatment of breast cancer. The first project involves developing a new treatment that could be given to patients prior to surgery to remove the cancerous cells. Rather than a chemotherapy, this new drug would activate the immune system to promote an anti-tumor response. “The idea is that if the cancer were to ever recur in the future, you’ve basically trained the body to identify, attack and kill any tumor cells that form,” said Crouch. “The bulk of the preclinical work for this is done, so the grant allows us to work with physicians to run a phase-1 clinical trial in patients with early-stage breast cancer to measure the anti-tumor response.” The second project will draw on the center’s imaging expertise to study how specific cancer types respond to treatment and identify the optimal treatment plan. Using animal models, the team will use imaging techniques to measure the metabolism of breast cancer cells before and after treatment to determine if the cancer is responding effectively to treatment or whether additional treatment, like a stronger form of chemotherapy or radiation, is necessary. Ideally, this work would be useful for general study of tumor behavior and for patient-specific tumor models. “Our thinking is that tumors’ response to any therapy can be measured by looking at how that tumor uses nutrients for fuel,” said Madonna. “This grant will challenge us to pinpoint how a tumor’s metabolism can better report on how successfully a tumor is treated, beyond what can typically be understood from current standard of care practices.” In a similar vein, the final project involves using optical tools to determine whether a patient needs treatment in the first place, and if they do, what level is necessary. By examining both fresh tissue samples and biopsy samples, the team will use a combination of optical and computational tools to predict the long-term outcome and risk level for patients. “We treat all early-stage breast cancers with the same treatments we’d use for more progressed cases, but some of these early-stage cancers can actually resolve on their own,” said Krieger. “But there is a small subset of patients that need aggressive treatments to prevent metastases or future recurrence. This project will help us identify which patients are at the highest risk.” Outside of her collaborators in GWHT, Ramanujam has assembled an inter-disciplinary team across the Pratt School of Engineering, the Duke University School of Medicine and the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Her program leadership team will include Crouch, Alexandra Thomas, an oncologist and professor of medicine and associate director of translational research at the Duke Cancer Institute, Lee Wilke, a breast cancer surgeon and the Hendricks Chair in Breast Cancer Surgery Research at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Additional members of the team at the DUSM include Maggie DiNome, the chief of breast surgery, Eun Lee Langman, assistant professor of radiology, Carey Anders, a professor of medicine and chief of the division of medicaloncology, Rachel Factor, associate professor of pathology, Smita Nair, professor of surgery, and Matthew Hirschey, an associate professor of pharmacology and cancer biology. “This award enables us to revolutionize treatment regimens by replacing them with ones that are more effective, less toxic and positively impact survival”. said Ramanujam. “In collaboration with my outstanding team, I will pursue high-risk, high reward research that I believe will maximize therapeutic benefit for early-stage breast cancer patients without wearing their bodies down and without stretching resources to an unacceptable level”.",

    "title": "UH research: Hawaiians’ wisdom and love of ʻāina evident in traditional agriculture",
    "text": "A University of Hawaiʻi team of researchers is gaining a more insightful understanding of how Hawaiians in ancient times grew food in wetlands and drylands. The team was led by Noa Lincoln, an associate researcher in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources and principal investigator of the Indigenous Cropping Systems laboratory . The researchers released five studies examining the distribution of Hawaiʻi’s agroforestry, the purposeful integration of trees and crops (or livestock) together. Previous studies suggested that Native Hawaiians sustained their population on a mere 6% of land alteration, according to a release of the studies by the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. However, the latest study published in Frontiers suggests that when accounting for agroforestry in addition to the range of other agricultural strategies in pre-colonial Hawaiʻi, Native Hawaiians may have altered closer to 22–29% of the land area. “While some may take this to mean that Hawaiians weren’t as sustainable as they are held up to be, I see it as the opposite,” Lincoln said in a UH news release. “The current narrative is just that our ancestors were walking lightly upon the land—that they didn’t change the landscape much. I see this work as saying that yes, they changed large amounts of the landscape, but they did it in a way that preserved ecosystem function and health.” Efforts to understand traditional agriculture have focused on the most intensive wetland and dryland cultivation because these forms of agriculture leave behind physical infrastructure that can be observed and mapped by archaeologists. In agroforestry systems, trees are the infrastructure. “These [wetland and dryland agriculture] were important building blocks, but we knew they were incomplete,” said Lincoln. “There were huge population centers, such as Hāmākua and Puna regions on Hawaiʻi Island that were showing no agriculture at all. And we know from our elders that these areas were supported primarily through agroforestry practices.” To fill in gaps of knowledge about traditional practices, PhD student Tiffany Lee georeferenced 19th century maps depicting traditional agroforestry. This work confirmed that current models do not capture agroforestry practices. The findings, published in Ecology & Society , demonstrated that agroforestry was widespread across the islands and provided an important dataset to start working with. Another study published in Agricultural Systems focused on the kukui tree (Aleurites moluccanus). The patterns of kukui on the landscape emerged as indicators of traditional agroforestry. In collaboration with Qi Chen, a professor in the Department of Geography and Environment, the team analyzed kukui canopy across the state in the cover story of Pacific Science , uncovering patterns that hinted at an enduring imprint of traditional Hawaiian agroforestry on the landscape. With data from historical maps and insights from the kukui tree, the team had the pieces to build spatial models on traditional agroforestry. A study published in Human Ecology suggested that agroforestry constituted the dominant footprint of traditional production systems in terms of landmass.

    "text": "Lyn May compartió una fotografía en sus redes sociales, la cual desató una ola de comentarios positivos por su aspecto rejuvenecido.\nHace algunas semanas, la famosa causó revuelo al confesar que sentía la muerte cerca. Sus comentarios fueron tras el fallecimiento de diversas celebridades como Tongolele, Daniel Bisogno y Dulce.\nLuce irreconocible\nLa vedette mexicana Lyn May ha sido una figura emblemática del espectáculo en México. Por años destacó por su talento y presencia escénica.\nSin embargo, su transformación física a lo largo de los años ha generado controversia y preocupación, especialmente debido a un procedimiento estético que le dejó secuelas negativas y permanentes en el rostro.\nLa famosa se ha sometido diversos tratamientos que le han ayudado a revertir en cierta medida los daños que le causaron. Ahora lució impactante y recibió cientos de elogios de sus seguidores.\n¿Cómo se ve Lyn May actualmente?\nA pesar de las secuelas, Lyn May se ha sometido a diversas intervenciones estéticas en un intento por mejorar su apariencia. Tal parece que ha obtenido buenos resultados, los cuales no ha tardado en presumir en sus redes sociales.\nRecientemente, sorprendió en redes al presumir un rostro diferente. A través de su cuenta de Instagram la actriz publicó una fotografía como promoción de una bebida de agave.\nEn la imagen se puede ver a Lyn May con una vestimenta totalmente rosa y adherida a su figura. No obstante, lo que causó sorpresa fue su piel tersa y sin signos de la edad.\nEste radical cambio generó debate entre sus seguidores. La mayoría elogiaron su gran cambio, aunque hubo otros que expresaron preocupación por los riesgos asociados a tantas intervenciones.\n¿Qué le sucedió en el rostro a Lyn May?\nElla misma ha admitido públicamente haberse sometido a múltiples procedimientos estéticos. Sin embargo, lo más relevante es que en entrevistas ha declarado que fue víctima de una mala praxis médica.\nSegún sus propias palabras, un supuesto especialista le inyectó aceites minerales (posiblemente aceite de bebé o parafina) en el rostro, con el objetivo de mejorar su apariencia.\nEsto le provocó graves daños en la piel, deformaciones y una inflamación crónica que ha alterado su aspecto de manera permanente.\nLyn May ha hablado abiertamente sobre el dolor físico y emocional que estas intervenciones le causaron, pero también ha mantenido una actitud desafiante, asegurando que sigue orgullosa de su imagen y que se mantiene activa y positiva a pesar de las críticas.\nMira también:\n[@emisorasunidas897]Arévalo se pronunció por captura de Luis Pacheco, exdirigente de 48 Cantones, y afirma que es un ataque contra el pueblo de Guatemala. . .\n[#MP][#LuisPacheco][#48Cantones][#Democracia][♬ sonido original - Emisoras Unidas]",
