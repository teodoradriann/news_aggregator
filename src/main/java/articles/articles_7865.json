    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected a shipyard and underscored the importance of a strong naval force in \"war preparations\", state media KCNA said on Friday.\nKim's visit is being made public after North Korea tested its new submarine-launched cruise missiles (SLCM) on Sunday, firing an upgraded missile for the second time in a week and accelerating its navy's nuclear armament, according to state media.\n\"Strengthening naval force is the most important issue in pushing ahead with war preparations\", KCNA cited Kim as saying during his visit to Nampho dockyard, a military shipbuilding base also referred to as Nampo.\nKim was briefed on various warship constructions for a new \"huge plan\" decided by the North Korean leadership, KCNA said, without elaborating.\nKCNA said on Monday that Kim had inspected the construction of a nuclear submarine and discussed issues related to the manufacturing of other types of new warships, but gave no details.\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Sandra Maler)",

    "text": "KOTA KINABALU (Dec 31): There are no forces with ill intent which can break Sabah, as long as the Sabahans remain united, said Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor. Hajiji said that, as the Chief Minister, he is committed to seeing the beloved Sabah remain united, prosperous, and inclusive, especially in the coming year. “We are strong only when we are united. When we are united we will be able to withstand any attempt to undermine stability, and to ensure that development can proceed unhindered,” he said in his New Year 2024 message, here today. Hajiji said that he was touched and grateful to the people and all like-minded supporters who have stood by the government, believing in its sincerity to do what is best for Sabah. “Let us put politics aside and discard any divisiveness that will only pull us apart. We must forge forward into the new year with resolve, united in diversity, and committed to doing good, in accordance with the mandate given to us by the rakyat,” he said. He said with the people’s support, the state government had made good strides in progressing its development plan under the Hala Tuju Sabah Maju Jaya (SMJ), and despite the challenges, it has been steadfast in implementing the SMJ agenda, and staying on course to see it through. Hajiji said that the recently passed state 2024 Budget, amounting to RM5.701 billion, was a testament to the state government’s commitment to drive economic growth and development in Sabah. “Our commitment to growth remains unwavering. We have set our sights on the many opportunities the state can leverage in all sectors. We will continue to build on our successes and pursue new investment opportunities, to create economic spin-offs and create jobs for the people,” he said. However, he said that all these successes and plans will account for nothing without the combined efforts and commitment of all, as well as a conducive environment to pursue the development goals. – Bernama",

    "title": "Lampard questions why Man Utd ‘paid that amount of money’ for ‘my lad’ as Ten Hag style unsuitable",
    "text": "Frank Lampard isn’t sure Mason Mount fits at Manchester United.\nFrank Lampard isn’t sure why Manchester United paid £55m for Mason Mount when Erik ten Hag had no clear “plan” for the England international, who doesn’t suit their style of football.\nMount has started just four Premier League games for his new club this season, due mainly to injury, and is yet to score for the Red Devils.\nThe 25-year-old struggled to make an impact when he did play and Lampard believes the lack of a defined role for Mount, along with having to vie with captain Bruno Fernandes for the No.10 could continue to be a problem for him.\nAsked about Mount’s struggles at Old Trafford on Sky Bet’s Stick to Football podcast, Lampard said: “A bit of injuries as well, to be fair to him, and a team that’s struggling and has a big negativity [around it] in certain ways.\n“From my point of view, because I took him to Derby, he changed everything there for me really. Him and [Fikayo] Tomori and [Harry] Wilson, but Mason particularly, his level in training was a high, high level.\n“Pressing brilliant, off-the-ball stuff brilliant, if you want to give him information he takes it like that [clicks fingers]. Will jump [forward to press], will recover, will jump, will recover. A great lad, good technically, very good technically.\n“So I think he’s really high level in loads of those areas and a proper lad, as I say, you could give him anything. I think he’s probably suffered from a change into a bad [situation].”\nHe continued: “He’s very driven. If you drop him, his face goes straight away – he’s one of those. Not in a bad way, but he’s like, ‘I want to show you’. He will absolutely want to show you [he deserves to play], he’s very determined like that.\n“I’m not just saying that because he’s my lad a bit and I’ve had a relationship on the pitch in terms of managing him, but I do think he’ll come good because of that and because of his talent.\n“And once the team gets more structure, because I do think it’s important for a structure of a team to say you’re an aggressive 8 or you’re in a 10. And the only worry I had when he went to Man United was, where do Bruno Fernandes and him fit?\n“You’ve also got Casemiro, and I know it’s starting to develop and change away from that already as an idea, but you kind of go: where do you fit?\n“And I think when you are – and this is not to dig Mason or Man United out for bringing him in – but I think when you get a player of that level for that amount of money, you’ve got to go: this is the plan. That’s what I’d want to hear, and my question would be: where does he fit?”\nWhen Jamie Carragher suggested he effectively has to play as a central midfielder, Lampard continued: “Which he’s not. I would say he’s probably slightly more advanced than me in general play, I liked to arrive from deeper, drop down and play a bit more and then arrive from deeper.\n“I think he’s higher. In Tuchel’s team that won the Champions League he was a 10, highest sort of 10 on the side, two 10s and then a 9, and I think he could do that better than I could. I liked to come from deeper.\n“He can play as a single 10 as well, but, again, you’re going into where the captain of the football club, Bruno Fernandes, is playing – who hardly gets injured, as far as I see it. So I think that will be a difficult one that’s a conundrum to solve as a team to get him into the team in his best position.”\nOn whether he is a fit for United’s style of play under Ten Hag, Lampard added: “I do think that Manchester United do a lot of their best work on the counter-attack, turning teams round, with Marcus Rashford going bang, bang, bang.\n“Maybe Mace has got to get to grips with what that looks like for him – all that high pressing stuff is great if you’re in a high-pressing team, but they’re not a massively high-pressing team.\n“All this stuff in tight areas up the pitch – which I think he’s good at and can get better at and can be more effective in the box and score more goals – I don’t think they stay there loads.\n“Their best stuff, when I’ve coached against United, is we’ll probably have a lot of the ball but be careful of [counter attacks] and I’m not sure Mace is one that is going to be joining Marcus, it’s not easy for anybody – it’s a different style of play.”\nREAD NOW: Ten Hag and Pochettino would have been sacked in any other season",

    "text": "The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has introduced a new WhatsApp number – 0709 570 000 – to allow the public to report crime anonymously, quickly, and securely. This digital upgrade gives Kenyans and members of the diaspora a convenient and discreet way to share crime-related information with investigators.\nThe new service complements the DCI’s existing toll-free hotline 0800 722 203, expanding the ways in which citizens can engage with law enforcement.\n“The new WhatsApp number provides an anonymous and secure channel through which the public, both locally and internationally, can share intelligence on crime,” said DCI Director Mohamed Amin.\nThe launch comes under the new Fichua Kwa DCI program – a public awareness campaign that encourages Kenyans to report crime without fear of retaliation. Through the utilization of new communication technology, the DCI also seeks to create greater public trust and facilitate greater community participation in crime prevention.\nSpeaking as the platform was relaunched on Tuesday, Amin said that the WhatsApp channel is a reflection of a closer relationship between the public and the DCI.\n“This enhancement is not just a communication tool, it is a symbol of our commitment to improving security through cooperation with citizens,” Amin said.\nHe explained that the WhatsApp line would allow for faster, easier, and more covert sharing of tipoffs on crimes and emphasized the importance of adopting new technologies as tools against evolving crime threats.\n“With the continuous advancement in technology, it’s vital that our crime-fighting mechanisms also evolve,” Amin said.\nHe added that the WhatsApp service would be most convenient to diaspora Kenyans as it will give them a direct and secure means of contributing towards security back home.\nThe DCI assured that the free-of-charge line 0800 722 203 remains accessible to those who cannot use WhatsApp. Both avenues are privacy safeguarding and guarantee complete anonymity.\nAmin acknowledged the vital role Kenyans have played in past investigations through the Fichua Kwa DCI initiative.\n“Among the many achievements we have recorded, many have been possible thanks to courageous citizens who reported suspicious activities through Fichua Kwa DCI,” he said.\nHe urged the public to continue using the newly enhanced reporting channels as part of a shared duty to secure the nation.",

    "text": "DA Pamela Price's office hit with lawsuit A former spokesperson for Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price has filed a lawsuit against the county for wrongful termination, discrimination, and failure to pay wages.\nOAKLAND, Calif. - A former spokesperson for Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price has filed a lawsuit against the county for wrongful termination, discrimination, and failure to pay wages.\nPatti Lee, the former spokesperson, said she was fired after pointing out what she believed were illegal practices, including violations of the state public records act.\nLee was a reporter at KTVU until 2014 and worked for Price as a public information officer for six months last year until she was fired.\nLee said in her lawsuit that she was subjected to humiliating and bullying behavior and that Price once remarked that her enemies are \"the media and the Asians.\"\n\"As a district attorney, you can&apos;t fire the person in charge, the public information officer, for upholding sort of the sanctimony of transparency, the First Amendment,\" said Lee&apos;s attorney Nick Roxborough.\nLee&apos;s firing followed an incident in which Berkeley Scanner founder Emilie Raguso was denied access to a news conference put on by the DA.\nThe Berkeley Scanner was first to report Lee&apos;s allegations.\nRaguso was later allowed to attend DA news conferences, but she and other media then requested records related to Price&apos;s media policies and press list.\nIn her lawsuit, Lee says she tried to respond to those requests but that her colleagues hid, deleted or altered records instead of producing them.\n\"Essentially they said they had no records,\" Raguso said Thursday.\nRaguso told KTVU Lee was one of the two spokespeople who led her out of the news conference, apparently at the behest of Price, who is now facing a recall election.\n\"I did feel that day that Patti was troubled by what was happening, and so when I did see her allegations come out later, I wasn&apos;t entirely surprised,\" Raguso said.\n\"Transparency is the oxygen of accountability for public officials and public agencies,\" said David Loy, legal director of the First Amendment Coalition. \"To the extent there may have been retaliation against Ms. Lee for standing up for the First Amendment, or the rights of persons requesting public records, that&apos;s a serious problem.\"\nThe district attorney&apos;s office said it could not comment on pending litigation.\nHenry Lee is a KTVU crime reporter.

    "title": "Seeing Red: Dr. Mads Gilbert's journey in Gaza | Yaşar Süngü",
    "text": "Norwegian Doctor Mads Gilbert met with Palestinians in his twenties in 1981 when the Israelis besieged and bombed West Beirut. Mads Gilbert expressed his experiences of those days with the words: \"Israel first cut off electricity and water to besiege the city. Thus, they prevented food and medicine from reaching the city. Then they bombed the city day and night. While doing this, they targeted not only military targets but also schools, residential areas, hospitals, ambulances, and even people trying to rescue the wounded. It was a terrible sight.\" And after witnessing the tragedy of the Palestinians under occupation in 1981, he devoted his life to this cause. We're talking about 43 years ago.\nMads Gilbert, upon hearing the news of Gaza being bombed while on vacation with his children for Christmas in 2008, bid farewell to his children and set out from Norway with his doctor friend. After the invasion started in 2008, he realized that there were no journalists in Gaza and that the Palestinian people were alone. In his book where he wrote about his experiences in 2008-2009, he describes this situation with the following words: \"My friend and I were able to enter Gaza through Egypt on the fifth day of the attack before the New Year of 2008. In addition to our medical services at Shifa Hospital, we had undertaken to convey our experiences to the world.\" Israel imposed an embargo on Gaza due to the Hamas government elected by the people of Gaza in 2007, and banned the entry and exit of humanitarian needs to the region. Arbitrarily, they attacked public institutions, hospitals, schools, and houses, and continued to do so. The Gaza Strip, which is five square kilometers, was home to about two million people. More than a million of its population lived in refugee camps. Jabalya, Gaza, Beit Lahya, Beit Hanun, Dir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, Rafah, and Abasan Kebir were refugee camps where people fled from bombs without homes. We're talking about 2007. That is, 17 years ago.\nThe bombardment in 2014 lasted fifty-one days. Dr. Gilbert announced this to the media with the following words: \"According to a UN report, Israel used more than five times the bombs used in the 2009 operation in the operation they named Protective Edge. Three thousand five hundred children were injured in the attack. Normally, they should have been protected by organizations like the UN and the Red Cross. But nothing was done. Israel enjoys a terrible impunity.\" That is, ten years ago.\nDr. Mads Gilbert, born in 1947, is now 76 years old. Since 1981, that is, for 43 years, he has been a witness to the genocide in Gaza. Witnessing the inhumanity suffered by the people of Palestine in Palestine, Mads Gilbert is a good person who values people not by their race, color, language, or religion, but because they are human. Just like Rachel Aliene Corrie, a 24-year-old American peace volunteer who was crushed to death under an armored bulldozer belonging to the Israeli Defense Forces in Refah in the southern Gaza Strip in 2003. Just like 25-year-old Aaron (Harun) Bushnell, an active-duty member of the US Air Force, who set himself on fire in front of the Israeli Embassy in Washington on February 25, 2024, saying, \"I will no longer participate in genocide. My action is not a big deal in the face of what the Palestinians are experiencing under the occupiers.\" Rachel, Aaron, and Mads, two of whom are martyrs and one of whom is still alive and struggling, are the three heroes of Gaza. None of them are Muslims, but they are human. Didn't you have to be human to be a Muslim anyway? It was necessary, but we forgot it. Our current misery is because of it.\nAs for us; We continue to think we're lucky to be born to Muslim parents. We continue to watch the genocide. We continue to break our fast with cola during Ramadan. Black or yellow? Red.\n# Mads Gilbert # Muslims # Genocide # Palestine # Gaza # Israel",

    "title": "Correa culpa mídia pela sobrevivência de ideias econômicas ultrapassadas | Revista Fórum",
    "text": "CARACAS -- Não é a falta de novos líderes de esquerda que facilita o avanço da direita na América Latina, mas o apoio que os politicos neoliberais recebem da mídia hereditária, hegemônica e corporativa. A opinião é do ex-presidente do Equador, o economista Rafael Correa, que se diz vítima dos jornalões e emissoras de rádio e TV de seu país, nos quais sofre assassinato de caráter quase diário. Te podría interesar Condenado a dez anos de prisão na Lava Jato equatoriana, que investigou obras locais da Odebrecht, ele afirma que foi alvo de lawfare como o presidente Lula -- preso depois de condenado antecipadamente no tribunal do Jornal Nacional. Correa vive no exílio faz sete anos, entre a Bélgica e a Venezuela. Em Caracas, recebeu a visita da revista Fórum para uma entrevista. Te podría interesar Nela, rejeitou a crítica que se faz a lideranças históricas do continente, acusadas de impedir o surgimento de sucessores para se perpetuar no poder. Segundo Correa, não é isso que favorece a direita, mas a mídia, que promove candidatos de ideias economicamente ultrapassadas que resistem na América Latina, como o neoliberalismo. Trechos: Fórum: A mídia é mesmo tão importante para os políticos conservadores? Correa: Acredito que ela tem o maior poder da história da Humanidade, não há exército que possa invadir o mundo, a desinformação pode. Os meios de comunicação destroem a democracia, temos eleições, mas não democracia. Porque um princípio democrático é que cada poder deve ter o seu contrapoder. Qual é o contrapoder da mídia? São empresas privadas, com fins lucrativos, estão lá para preservar o status quo, o que interfere completamente no campo do jogo democrático. Nos culpamos de que não formamos lideranças? A de [Hugo] Chávez não é que tenha sido formada, é natural, como as de Evo Morales, Cristina Fernández. São lideranças fundacionais, que são muito difíceis de substituir. A culpa é dos dirigentes políticos? Não, é como se Messi não tivesse treinado um sucessor, pudesse ter financiado escolas de futebol. É muito difícil que surja imediatamente outro Messi. Temos que compreender essas coisas. Não creio que seja correto e não é uma crítica verdadeira. A Revolução Cidadã [do Equador] tem muitos líderes. Acredito que o kirchnerismo também formou muitos líderes, acho que o Partido dos Trabalhadores no Brasil tem muitos líderes, mas é muito difícil substituir um Lula, uma Cristina Fernández, o que não é feito por decreto. Fórum: Por que os conservadores destruiram a Unasul, que seria o embrião de algo parecido com a União Europeia? Correa: Precisamente por causa dessa polarização, a polarização na América Latina foi aquela em que a direita veio com a fome retardada. Lembre-se dos anos 90, do Consenso de Washington, do fim da História. Nas três eleições presidenciais que tivemos durante os anos 90, no Equador, em todos os segundos turnos era direita contra direita. A esquerda não existia no início do século 21, mas em seguida ela varre todo o continente e com governos extremamente bem sucedidos. Uma direita atordoada não sabia como reagir, até que passou o torpor. De 2014 em diante se formou o que chamei de restauração conservadora. A direita veio com um desejo de vingança e destruiu tudo o que era supostamente produto de governos progressistas. A integração regional vai além das ideologias, mas destruíram também a Unasul. Foi fácil destruir a Unasul por causa de erros cometidos na sua formação, como a regra do consenso, que exige unanimidade para decidir. Vieram governos traidores como o de [Lenin] Moreno [que retirou o Equador da Unasul e pediu de volta o prédio sede da entidade, em Quito]. Precisamos de um esforço grande para retomar a Unasul. É necessário, mas não vejo muita vontade nesses esforços, é uma pena em todo caso [o presidente Lula quer recriar a entidade, que hoje sobrevive no papel]. Por que a Unasul foi destruída? Pela miopia de uma direita que veio com a fome atrasada, pela rendição de governos de direita -- porque não é conveniente para os Estados Unidos uma América Latina unida -- e pela vulnerabilidade da Unasul, devido aos erros cometidos na sua formação. Por exemplo, a regra do consenso, que dá poder de veto. Basta um querer para destruir tudo. Abaixo, outros trechos da entrevista:",
