    "text": "Morowali Smelter Blast; PT IMIP Workers Urge Company to Improve OHS System Translator Editor 28 December 2023 08:06 WIB TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The head of the labor union of IMIP Hendri said that the compensation given to the victims of the [smelter](https://www.tempo.co/search?waktu=&kanal=&subkanal=&domain=2&q=smelter) fire is not an adequate remedy for the situation. \"Don't let the compensation for the victims lead IMIP to neglect its main obligation to improve the occupational health and safety (OHS or locally K3) system to protect workers,\" Hendri said in a written statement received by Tempo on Wednesday, Dec. 27. Workers' safety must be the number one priority, Hendri said. \"A repeat of this tragedy must not occur just because of IMIP's desire for production,\" he added. It was previously reported that the incident happened on Sunday of a smelter furnace owned by PT Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel (ITSS) in Morowali that killed 18 workers. PT IMIP then delivered Rp600 million to compensate for the death of its workers, including school tuition for two of the worker's children. Meanwhile, the Media Relations Head of PT IMIP Dedy Kurniawan said non-fatality victims are to be given compensation in each case. Hendri said that compensation was indeed one of the workers' demands. He also hopes that those injured in the incident will be guaranteed financial aid for treatment. \"Additionally, workers must be compensated and their wages paid and they could resume working [at PT IMIP] post-recovery,\" he said. However, workers also have several other demands, such as periodic revitalization, improvement of health facilities, provision of ambulances at IMIP, and quality OHS officers, as well as erasure of the ferroalloy department. \"We also demand the policy that allows inter-department lending of workers to be canceled and a commemoration of the incident every 24th of December,\" he concluded.

Los memes no tuvieron piedad con la eliminación de Inter Miami en Concachampions\nEl conjunto de la leyenda argentina consumó un gran fracaso al quedar eliminado en Semifinales ante Vancouver Whitecaps.\nEl Inter de Miami de Lionel Messi sufrió este miércoles uno de sus golpes más duros al ser eliminados en las Semifinales de la Copa de Campeones de Concacaf con la derrota de 1-3 en casa contra el Vancouver Whitecaps, por lo que los memes no tardaron en llegar.\nLos de la Florida llegaban con el marcador en contra tras haber perdido 2-0 en el partido de Ida en Canadá, pero de inmediato ilusionaron a sus seguidores con un gol tempranero cortesía de Jordi Alba, solo para ver una gran remontada del visitante en la segunda mitad.\nDe esta forma, el conjunto dirigido por Javier Mascherano consumó un gran fracaso, pues trascender en este torneo internacional era uno de sus grandes objetivos del semestre, ya que el año pasado cayeron con Monterrey en Cuartos de Final, ya con Messi en el plantel.\nMemes se desatan contra Messi e Inter de Miami tras eliminación\nAl ser Lionel Messi una figura tan mediática cuenta con una gran cantidad de detractores, por lo que desde antes del silbatazo final se desataron las burlas en redes sociales contra su equipo y su persona con los tradicionales memes.\nEl '10' del Inter Miami fue el principal blanco de los trolleos de los aficionados, que esperaban verlo en la Final del torneo de Concacaf, aunque tampoco sus compañeros y el DT Javier Mascherano no salieron bien librados.\nCabe mencionar que este mismo día su acérrimo rival Cristiano Ronaldo quedó fuera de la Champions asiática con el Al Nassr, pero ni esto detuvo a los seguidores de CR7 para destacar lo sucedido con Messi.\nA continuación, te presentamos las creaciones más divertidas y originales del internet que dejó la eliminación de Lionel Messi y el Inter de Miami en la Copa de Campeones de la Concacaf.\nQueda prohibida la reproducción total o parcial del contenido de esta página, mismo que es propiedad de MEDIOTIEMPO S.A.

    "title": "Kia, Samsung join hands to make cars smarter - THE INVESTOR",
    "text": "Korea’s leading auto, electronics giants expand partnership with series of collaboration announcements\nKia has partnered with Samsung Electronics to advance the digital experience of the former’s Platform Beyond Vehicle, or PBV, offerings by integrating the latter’s internet of things, or IoT, solutions into the Kia PBVs, the automaker said Thursday.\nAccording to Kia, the two signed a memorandum of understanding during Kia’s 2025 EV Day held in Tarragona, Spain, on Monday to mark the latest collaboration announcement between Korea’s two leading conglomerates -- Hyundai Motor Group and Samsung Group -- after they consecutively unveiled a series of plans to work together in robot-dedicated batteries and smart factories earlier this week.\nUnder the agreement, Samsung’s business-to-business IoT platform -- SmartThings Pro -- will be applied to Kia PBVs to enable automated connectivity with business spaces. This solution is expected to help business customers integrate and manage IoT-enabled appliances without complex installations, allowing users to set up certain routines based on the destination entered into the vehicle’s infotainment system.\nFor example, if a bakery owner were to set a wholesale market as her destination in a Kia PBV, the pre-programmed routine would automatically activate an ingredient purchase mode so that the car’s internal cooling system makes sure the purchased food stays fresh during the drive.\nAfter visiting the market, the bakery owner could set her own store as the next destination in the PBV to activate a commute mode that turns on the air conditioning, signage and other equipment in the store while producing a to-do list as the system checks the inventory.\nWhile on the road after business hours, the bakery owner could also activate a closing mode that ensures devices in the shop are turned off, energy-saving measures are applied and security features are engaged. The system sends real-time notifications to the PBV if unusual activities or system malfunctions are detected.\nA guesthouse owner, meanwhile, could activate an unmanned operation mode that enables remote check-in and check-out, unlocks room doors for visitors and controls electronic devices.\n“Kia PBVs are designed to be more than just vehicles -- they are intelligent business solutions that connect seamlessly with digital ecosystems,” said Kim Sang-dae, head of Kia’s PBV Division.\n\"We anticipate that our business collaboration with Samsung, leveraging its AI B2B solution SmartThings Pro, will extend the vehicle user experience for our business customers beyond PBVs into the broader IoT ecosystem. This partnership is expected to create new opportunities to bring value to the customer.\"\nOn top of the examples already mentioned, the collaboration between Kia and Samsung is expected to yield other IoT solutions specifically customized to the needs of PBV drivers across a range of industries in global markets.\n\"By integrating SmartThings Pro into Kia PBVs, we plan to present an intelligent new way for businesses to connect to their customers,\" said Park Chan-woo, executive vice president of the B2B Integrated Offering Center at Samsung Electronics.\n\"We will provide an optimized, integrated store management experience based on customized solutions to cater to a range of B2B customers, including the self-employed and small business owners.\"\nDuring the EV Day event, Kia unveiled the PV5, its first PBV model, along with the latest versions of the EV4 and EV2 concept cars.\nBy Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)",

    "text": "Dyche criticises penalty laws after Everton lose to Man City\nEverton manager Sean Dyche has questioned how Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard's apparent handball against Liverpool wasn't a penalty if Amadou Onana was adjudged guilty of handball in their defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday night. The Toffees felt harshly done by when Julian Alvarez scored a penalty at Goodison Park to make it 2-1 to City.\nTrending While the ball clearly struck Onana's hand, Everton felt the midfielder was very close to Nathan Ake when the City defender took his shot on goal and that his hand was not necessarily in an unnatural position. Dyche called the decision for referee John Brooks to the point to the spot \"bizarre\" post-match.\nThe call came just days after Liverpool were denied a seemingly blatant penalty for a handball offence from Odegaard against Arsenal at Anfield. PGMOL said that the VAR did not overrule referee Chris Kavanagh because it was \"not a clear and obvious error\".\nThey also said the Norwegian's arm moved towards his body and not his ball and that it wasn't a deliberate or unnatural action from the attacking midfielder. Yet it was widely deemed an incorrect call and even Arsenal defender William Saliba reacted: \"Of course, it was a penalty. But, I'm not the referee and we have to accept [the decision].\"\nAnd Dyche said: \"When they [IFAB] come out with these rules, how many active football people, managers, do they speak to? And this can be across the board, it doesn't just have to be the Premier League .\nSean Dyche thinks Liverpool should have had a penalty vs Arsenal (Image: GETTY/SKY SPORTS)\nEverton midfielder Amadou Onana conceded a penalty against Man City (Image: GETTY) \"They may do that, but I have a feeling they probably don't. If they do, they keep it under wraps because I've never heard of it. Handball is such an odd thing. The one the other day from Odegaard, how's that not a penalty? It's just bizarre.\n\"And then our one, that's where we're going and how can those two things be that different in their outcome? You can't work it out. That to me is unfathomable and everyone is scratching their head.\"\nThe Everton manager has claimed all of the Premier League 's managers want to see the handball rule changed. He boss: \"Managers want to see a difference, especially when it's overpowering. The view on handball is overpowering, I don't mind telling you that.\n\"It's not a secret. We had a Zoom call, all the managers were there and they all said this has got to be changed. Roy Hodgson spoke very clearly, as he does about his feelings on it, and gave a couple of incidents and basically we all said we've no clue. It's a real head-scratcher.\n\"One week it's given, the next it's not. There wasn't anyone saying 'we're gaining' or 'we're losing', none of that. It was just that it was wrong on every level and all over the place.\nBecome an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial READ MORE...\nMan Utd could be about to get rid of £86m flop Antony due to three names [COMMENT]\nJohn Terry identifies next Chelsea wonderkid ready to break into first team [OPINION]\nLiverpool may have saved themselves £50m-plus with player Virgil van Dijk loves [FEATURE]\nSean Dyche wants the Premier League handball law tweaked (Image: GETTY) \"Every manager said this has got to change. I just find the rule bizarre and I don't think anyone understands it.\" Ex-Everton boss Roberto Martinez, now in charge of the Portugal national team, said on broadcaster Amazon Prime: \"For me, it is not a penalty at all. For me, football people know that it is not a penalty.\"\nWhile ex- Premier League ref Mark Clattenburg added: \"We're discussing handball for many, many years and we are still no further forward of actually improving it. One week it is given, one week it's not. Is it deliberate or is it not?\n\"Is the arm outstretched or is it not? Every week we are debating it and the referees are just trying to apply the Laws of the Game. If the referee didn't give that penalty, he would be criticised.\n\"He has given it and is criticised. The law needs changing and it needs the coaches, players and referees to get round and try to find a better way to understand handball.\"\nRelated articles Premier League rule has saved Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag from another cruel blow Man Utd receive transfer response as Erik ten Hag 'eyes second January deal'",

    "text": "The new plant-based soft gel will launch on Friday, January 19, providing Arizona consumers with a unique and innovative capsule option. Ally Biotech, dba Life Is Chill, a science-based provider of leading-edge bioactive delivery solutions for cannabinoids, today announces the launch of its live resin soft-gel capsules, ResinTime, under its Life Is Chill product line. The initial offering to the market is vegan-friendly, a new innovative soft gel based on a tapioca-starch and sugar-free product that addresses some of the dietary needs of consumers. The launch of live resin capsules marks a new era for soft gels in the Arizona market and will meet the increasing demand for products made from fresh-frozen cannabis. “Capsules are an increasingly popular choice for those seeking a smoke-free and sugar-free product, but the common practice of using gelatin in pills makes them inaccessible to people who prefer plant-based products or people that have allergies to bovine gelatin,” said Francis Baczek, President at Life Is Chill. “Our newest addition to the Chill Pill product line solves this problem with the additional benefit of high-quality live resin.” The ResinTime soft gels will officially launch on January 19th, 2024, at The Superior Dispensary in Phoenix. The vegan-friendly ResinTime is the company's newest addition to its current portfolio of easy-to-swallow THC soft-gel capsules, which includes six other variations: Day Caps, Night Caps, Anytime Caps, Anytime Hybrid+, Extreme Caps, and THCa Caps. “We are honored to kick off the launch of these live resin soft gels, a first of its kind in the Arizona market,” said Steve Shapiro, founder and CEO of The Superior Dispensary. “As a vegan, I’m excited to have a vegan-friendly product available for consumers. These capsules will provide another great option for customers seeking new ways to consume live resin-based products in an easily digestible way.” The award-winning soft gel brand is available in dozens of dispensaries across the state and has cemented itself as an Arizona staple for almost a decade. With the global cannabis capsule market expected to reach $108.14 billion by 2029, according to Data Bridge Market Research, and at least 6% of the American population identifying as either vegetarian or vegan, this new launch will meet the growing demand for dietary-friendly live resin products and provide an inhalation-free and sugar-free method of consumption for Arizona cannabis users. The new product launch follows Ally Biotech’s acquisition of the Chill Pill line in the spring of 2023. It continues the company’s plan to expand its product line and establish itself as a market leader in the soft gel category. For more information about the Chill Pill, visit Lifeischill.com.
