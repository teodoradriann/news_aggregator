    "text": "Legislation from pharmacists likely in 2025, Insurance Department lawyer says By: Sonny Albarado - December 19, 2024 5:06 pm Booth Rand, general counsel at the Arkansas Insurance Department, (right) answers a question from a lawmaker during a legislative subcommittee meeting on Dec. 19, 2024. He is seated with (left to right) Allison Hatfield, chief of staff for the state Department of Commerce, Jake Windley, director of legislative affairs and policies for the department of commerce, and Alan McClain, Arkansas Insurance Commissioner. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)\nArkansas lawmakers on Thursday rejected a proposed rule that would have allowed pharmacists to be paid a dispensing fee by drug middlemen who reimburse them for prescription costs.\nMembers of the Administrative Rules subcommittee of the Arkansas Legislative Council spent about two hours questioning the Insurance Department’s legal counsel about the necessity for the proposal before rejecting it by voice vote. There was at least one audible dissent.\nThe rule would have allowed the insurance commissioner to determine the amount health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) would have to tack on to reimbursements to pharmacists, department legal counsel Booth Rand told lawmakers Thursday.\nThe dispensing fee could range from zero to a maximum of $10 based on data collected from PBMs and other interested parties, Rand said. An earlier survey of health plans projected an increase in health premiums between 3% and 4% if the dispensing fee was $9.\nThe rule was intended to replace an emergency rule approved in September that expires in mid-January. The emergency measure authorized the Insurance Department to review reimbursement rates to “ensure that pharmacies will at least be paid [federally determined] minimums” and to add a dispensing fee if the commissioner determines a pharmacy’s reimbursement “is not fair and reasonable.” A 2015 state law regulating PBMs, requires reimbursements to be “fair and reasonable” but doesn’t define the term.\nIn response to a question from Rep. Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, Rand said the department has the authority to collect the data without the rule, “but if the commissioner decided to impose a fee, the PBMs could object that there’s no rule in place authorizing it.”\nPBMs are companies that negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers.\nThe nation’s three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, OptumRX and Express Scripts — are owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the prescription market in the United States, according to a Federal Trade Commission interim study released in July.\nCurrent PBM practices are “unfair and unreasonable, not only to independent pharmacies but chain pharmacies as well,” Rep. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said Thursday. Ultimately, this affects “our constituents,” patients who don’t know who to complain to if their pharmacy closes or they have an issue with prescription payments by their insurer, she said.\n“When you control 80% of the prescriptions,” Flowers said of PBMs, “you have control over determining the formularies, you silence your pharmacists who must contract with you because you control all of the prescriptions, you own pharmacies, you own insurance companies … How do we ensure what is fair and reasonable within the law since they basically control the business, control the market, control reimbursements?”\nAllison Hatfield, Commerce Department chief of staff, responded, “We see this rule as a mechanism to enforce the fair and reasonable language in the law.”\nAsked by subcommittee co-chair Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, how that would increase the cost of business, Hatfield replied “there would be no change,” if a PBM is paying a fair and reasonable reimbursement rate.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.",

    "text": "Caitlyn’s Weather Wonders: Extreme cold but beautiful phenomenon MANKATO, Minn. (KEYC) - Even though we have been dealing with dangerously cold conditions and breezy winds, Mother Nature still reminds us that there is always beauty around us. When you have very cold temperatures, powdery snow that can be easily blown around, and breezy winds, you get beautiful features related to the sun’s light mixing with the blowing snow. The sun’s light interacting with the ice crystals in the air will lead to the formation of some beautiful features that we typically only get to see when it’s frigid, breezy, and snowy outside. The most common features that we see are sundogs, which are rainbow like features located on the right and/or left side of the sun, and the 22-degree halo, which is a halo around the sun that may look like a less vivid rainbow. Sundogs form when sunlight is refracted by hexagonal-shaped ice crystals. And yes, the shape of the ice crystal does matter (the shape indicates that it is very, very cold outside). Once the sunlight hits the ice crystals, the light is then bent 22-degrees as it passes through the ice crystal and reaches our eyes. The bending of that light is what causes the optical illusion we know as sundogs. Sundogs will always be located within/on the 22-degree halo around the sun, though we may not always see the halo, just like we may not always see 2 sundogs. There are many other features that can form due to the powdery snow being blown across/in front of the sun.

    "text": "The Shocking Truth About Tapping on Fish Tanks: Why It’s More Harmful Than You Think What does tapping on a fish tank do to the fish? In short, it terrifies and stresses them . Fish have highly sensitive hearing, and the vibrations from tapping on the glass are amplified in the water, creating a jarring and potentially harmful experience. Imagine someone repeatedly banging on the walls of your home – that’s the equivalent of what you’re doing to a fish when you tap on their tank. This article delves into the details of why this seemingly innocent action can have severe consequences for your aquatic companions, plus answers some related questions you may have.\nUnderstanding Fish Hearing: More Than You Realize The Underwater Soundscape Unlike humans who rely heavily on air to transmit sound, fish live in a world where sound travels much more efficiently through water. Water is denser than air, allowing vibrations to propagate faster and further. Fish have evolved specialized sensory systems to take advantage of this. They have an inner ear , similar to mammals, which detects vibrations transmitted through the skull. Additionally, many fish possess a lateral line , a sensory organ running along the sides of their bodies that detects subtle changes in water pressure.\nThe Amplifying Effect of the Tank The glass of the aquarium acts as a vibrational conductor . When you tap on it, the sound waves travel through the glass and into the water, where they are significantly amplified. A seemingly gentle tap can create a sonic boom effect for the fish inside. This sudden and unexpected burst of noise can be incredibly stressful.\nThe Consequences of Tank Tapping Stress and Anxiety The primary consequence of tapping on a fish tank is stress . Constant exposure to loud and sudden noises can elevate stress hormones in fish, weakening their immune system and making them more susceptible to disease. Stressed fish may exhibit several behavioral changes, including:\nHiding: Fish may spend more time hiding among decorations or plants. Erratic Swimming: Fish may swim frantically or erratically. Loss of Appetite: Stressed fish may refuse to eat. Faded Coloration: Colors may become less vibrant. Increased Aggression: Some fish may become more aggressive towards tankmates. Hearing Damage While less common with occasional tapping, repeated and forceful tapping can lead to hearing damage . Just like loud noises can damage human ears, intense vibrations can damage the delicate structures within a fish’s inner ear. In severe cases, this can lead to permanent hearing loss, making it harder for fish to detect predators, find food, and communicate with each other.\nLong-Term Health Impacts Chronic stress resulting from constant disturbances, including tank tapping, can have long-term health consequences. These include:\nWeakened Immune System: Making fish more vulnerable to infections and parasites. Reduced Growth Rates: Stressed fish may not grow as quickly or as large as their unstressed counterparts. Reproductive Problems: Stress can interfere with spawning and egg development. Shortened Lifespan: In extreme cases, constant stress can ultimately shorten a fish’s lifespan. Understanding complex ecosystems requires comprehension of their sensitivity to disturbances, topics explored in resources available from The Environmental Literacy Council . What to Do Instead of Tapping Alternative Ways to Get Your Fish’s Attention If you want to interact with your fish, there are much better ways to do so that don’t involve causing them stress.\nVisual Cues: Fish recognize their owners. Simply approaching the tank or making gentle movements near the glass can get their attention. Feeding Time: Fish quickly learn that your presence often means food. They will associate you with positive experiences. Use a Laser Pointer (Carefully): Some fish, especially predatory species, enjoy chasing a laser pointer beam. However, use this sparingly and never shine the laser directly into their eyes. Observe Quietly: Sometimes, the best way to interact with your fish is simply to observe them. This allows you to appreciate their natural behavior without disturbing them. Educating Others One of the most important things you can do is to educate others about the dangers of tapping on fish tanks. Many people are unaware of the harm they are causing. By spreading awareness, you can help protect fish from unnecessary stress.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Is it okay to tap on a fish tank lightly? No, even light tapping can be harmful. While the intensity of the tap matters, even a gentle tap can startle and stress fish due to their sensitive hearing. It’s best to avoid tapping altogether.\n2. Can fish get used to tapping on the tank? While fish may appear to become habituated to tapping, this doesn’t mean they are no longer stressed. Habituation is a process where an animal learns to ignore a stimulus, but the underlying stress response may still be present.\n3. Do different types of fish react differently to tapping? Yes, some fish species are more sensitive than others. Shy or skittish species are likely to be more easily stressed by tapping, while more outgoing species may appear less affected. However, all fish are susceptible to the negative effects of noise pollution.\n4. Does the size of the tank make a difference? Yes, in smaller tanks, the vibrations are more concentrated, making the impact of tapping even more significant. Larger tanks may dissipate the sound waves more effectively, but tapping should still be avoided.\n5. Can children be taught not to tap on fish tanks? Absolutely! With clear explanations about the harm it causes to the fish, children can easily understand and learn to respect the fish’s environment. Making it a fun learning experience will help the message stick.\n6. What if someone accidentally bumps the tank? An accidental bump is unlikely to cause significant harm. However, repeated or forceful bumping should be avoided.\n7. Is it okay to use magnets to clean the tank? Yes, using magnetic algae cleaners is generally safe, as long as you use them gently and avoid scraping the glass too forcefully.\n8. Can vibrations from nearby speakers or construction affect fish? Yes, loud music, construction noise, and other sources of vibration can stress fish. Minimize these disturbances as much as possible, especially during sensitive periods like spawning.\n9. How can I tell if my fish are stressed? Signs of stress in fish include hiding, erratic swimming, loss of appetite, faded coloration, increased aggression, and rapid breathing.\n10. What can I do to reduce stress in my fish tank? Provide plenty of hiding places, maintain stable water parameters, avoid sudden changes in temperature or lighting, and minimize disturbances. A calm and stable environment is crucial for fish health.\n11. Are there any sounds that fish enjoy? Generally, silence or very low-frequency sounds are best. Avoid loud or sudden noises. Consider adding live plants to your aquarium; they can help dampen vibrations and create a more natural soundscape.\n12. Can I use sound to train my fish? While fish can be trained using positive reinforcement, sound is not the best tool for this. Visual cues, such as specific hand gestures or feeding routines, are generally more effective and less stressful.\n13. How often should I change the water in my fish tank? Regular water changes are essential for maintaining good water quality and reducing stress in fish. Aim to change 25-50% of the water every 1-2 weeks, depending on the size of the tank and the number of fish.\n14. What is the best way to clean a fish tank? Use a gravel vacuum to remove debris from the substrate and clean the sides of the tank with an algae scraper. Avoid using soap or detergents, as these can be harmful to fish.\n15. Where can I learn more about responsible fishkeeping? There are many resources available online and in local aquarium stores. The enviroliteracy.org website also offers valuable information about aquatic ecosystems and responsible environmental practices.\nIn conclusion, while tapping on a fish tank may seem like a harmless action, it can have serious consequences for the health and well-being of your aquatic pets. By understanding the sensitivity of fish hearing and adopting alternative ways to interact with your fish, you can create a healthier and more stress-free environment for them. Remember, responsible fishkeeping is about respecting the needs of your fish and providing them with the best possible care.",

But with so many opportunities, how do you know which projects will make a mark in the long run? Well, Qubetics, EOS, and Aptos are worth attention to. Each brings something unique to the table and has the potential for rapid growth, but they each operate in different niches, so choosing the right one could make all the difference for anyone looking for big gains.\nQubetics, with its revolutionary approach to blockchain interoperability, has made headlines with its presale success. Meanwhile, EOS’s metaverse-focused approach is gaining momentum, and Aptos is rethinking decentralized AI. As of now, these three are among the best crypto presale to join in April 2025, each offering groundbreaking features and real-world applications.\nBut why exactly should anyone care about these presales? The answer is simple: each project targets a specific challenge within the blockchain ecosystem and seeks to address it in ways previous generations of coins couldn't. Qubetics, for instance, focuses on multi-chain interoperability and providing businesses with tools to connect across various networks. So, if you're serious about exploring the best crypto presale to join in April 2025, this article will dive into what makes these projects stand out and why they could change the crypto space.\nRegarding blockchain interoperability, Qubetics has emerged as a key player. The project’s presale has already raised over $15.8 million, with more than 506 million tokens sold to 24,200+ holders. The success of its presale is proof that there’s a strong demand for solutions like those offered by Qubetics, which simplifies how different blockchain networks can communicate.\nQubetics addresses a massive pain point for businesses and developers: the friction between blockchain platforms. For example, blockchain interoperability allows businesses to easily transfer data and assets across chains without worrying about compatibility issues. This is precisely what Qubetics offers with its multi-chain interoperability solution.\nQubetics also comes with a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and an advanced development tool called QubeQode IDE.

    "title": "Pedestrian-car crashes rise, what the problem looks like in Hampton Roads",
    "text": "More pedestrians are being hit by cars than a decade ago, according to federal crash data. The impact of pedestrian involved crashes is devastating to those in Hampton Roads who have seen the impact. \"We hear story after story of family and friends sitting at home waiting for that call of someone they've expected 15-minutes ago, 30-minutes ago, an hour ago...\" said Rutter Mills managing partner Arthur \"Brother\" Rutter III. Those involved have their lives changed in just a few seconds. \"Most of the time those who are injured or killed as a pedestrian are walking to a neighbor's home, they're going out for a quick meal. It's the most common, normal, everyday activities,\" said Rutter. \"Then all of a sudden they don't return home. Sometimes their families don't know what happened because the phone's been damaged, or they've been knocked out, or unfortunately they've been killed.\" Police and attorneys said the issue continues to grow across the country and in Hampton Roads. \"Obviously it's upsetting for us because we don't want to see anyone injured and we don't want to see anyone killed as a result of a vehicle versus pedestrian crash,\" said Virginia Beach Police Department master police officer C.M. Wilson. Since 2010, pedestrian deaths have risen in the U.S. by more than 70 percent, according to the Governor's Highway Safety Association and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Virginia DMV data reveals that in 2022 Hampton Roads had 311 crashes involving pedestrians, 38 of which resulted in fatalities. The preliminary 2023 data shows there has been 364 pedestrian-involved crashes this year, which resulted in 30 fatalities. Virginia DMV also reported that over the past four years, the majority of pedestrian involved crashes occurred in urban areas, after dark, and when the pedestrians were crossing improperly or walking in the road. That makes sense to those at Rutter Mills. \"We find it in urban areas with high speeds. If you get speeds through densely populated areas that are 45mph or more, it happens more often. We find places without sidewalks it happens more often. We find in intersections of slow and high-speed areas it happens more often,\" said Rutter. And Rutter said there are factors that contribute to the frequency and severity of a crash. \"Two things that seem to be driving this are distracted driving/phone use and size of car,\" said Rutter. \"Even with not having any distraction there's a lag time in your brain that's innate where there is a bit of a delay before you realize you need to brake to avoid what's in front of you,\" added master police officer Wilson. That's why police ask you to remain alert while driving or walking. Police also encourage drivers to drive the speed limit and pedestrians to wear high-visibility clothing and use crosswalks. \"Under Virginia Law there's a couple of things about crosswalks,\" said Rutter. \"If you're in a crosswalk you have the right of way. So, a pedestrian using a crosswalk usually is not at fault. But under Virginia Law you're required to use a crosswalk if one is reasonably available. So, if you look left and right, and there's an intersection with a crosswalk, use it.\" \"...Knowing that even if you have the right of way that vehicle that's approaching you might not see you,\" added master police officer Wilson. If you're involved in an accident, police remind you to call for help and remain on scene. Additionally, the Virginia DMV provides federal grant funds to organizations for safety. They're accepting applications through February. For more information visit: https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/news/dmv-wants-help-you-save-lives-your-community . More stories from Virginia Beach",

    "title": "Only Oil Refinery in Scotland Closes With 400 Jobs Lost | The Epoch Times",
    "text": "Around 400 jobs will be lost when Grangemouth, Scotland’s only oil refinery, closes in the second quarter of 2025. Petroineos confirmed on Thursday that it would cease refinery operations and would transition to a finished fuels import terminal and distribution hub, subject to consultation with staff. The company, which is owned in partnership by British company Ineos and the Chinese state-owned PetroChina, had said last year that the site “faces significant challenges due to global market pressures and the energy transition.” The number of staff is expected to fall from 475 to 75 in the next two years. Grangemouth is the oldest of the UK’s six refineries and supplies 65 percent of Scotland’s oil products, including petrol and diesel. The Scottish Government’s net zero and energy minister, Gillian Martin, said that she was disappointed in the decision. Martin said the Scottish Government has “consistently made clear our preference was for refining to continue as long as possible” and had been pressing shareholders for a positive decision “until the 11th hour.” Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Petroineos’s decision was “deeply disappointing.” Petroineos Urged to ReconsiderOn top of the £100 million package to be invested in local energy projects, Project Willow, worth an additional £1.5 million, will explore the site’s long-term future. Three green options being considered include focusing on low carbon hydrogen, clean eFuels, or sustainable aviation fuels. Both the UK and Scottish governments have also said they will be helping affected workers find new jobs. On Friday, Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney met with unions and workforce representatives and urged Petroineos to reconsider its decision. Swinney said, “I talk to the company, my ministers talk to the company, I’ve talked to the workforce.” “I think the decision is premature and I would encourage Petroineos to consider what options there are to prolong the life of the refinery,” he said. A spokesman for Petroineos said that in the last week, the refinery has lost around £381,000 per day, and absorbed total losses of £590 million. The spokesman continued: “We have always communicated openly and directly with Scottish and UK governments, including sharing financial and operational details. “Our intentions regarding the refinery and a timing envelope were communicated publicly as far back as November 2023. “It is hard to conceive that any owner would be able or willing to sustain losses on this scale indefinitely and in the face of competitive pressure from newer, more modern facilities across Europe and elsewhere in the world.” ‘Industrial Vandalism’ for Net ZeroThe union Unite called the closure “an act of industrial vandalism,” challenging the governments’ rationale for achieving carbon emissions targets while decimating key industries. Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said: “This dedicated workforce has been let down by Petroineos and by the politicians in Westminster and Holyrood who have failed to guarantee production until alternative jobs are in place. “This is now the last chance for this Labour government to show whether it’s really on the side of workers and communities.” “The road to net zero cannot be paid for with workers’ jobs,” Graham said, pressing the government to ensure jobs are safeguarded. Tata Steel’s Green TransitionThe closure of the Scottish oil refinery comes the same week that the [government agreed on a deal](https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/government-commits-500-million-for-tata-steels-green-transition-5722330)with Tata Steel to secure some jobs while the Port Talbot plant in Wales moves to a low-carbon system for producing steel. Despite the combined £1.25 billion commitment and promises to secure 5,000 jobs around the country, some 2,800 people will still lose their jobs at the plant when the last blast furnace is closed, because the electric arc system replacing the furnaces will take three years to construct and when completed, will need fewer workers. Gary Smith, leader of the GMB union, warned that the push to lower emissions will come at a cost. Smith said: “We really have to stop this decarbonisation through de-industrialisation. Serving up P45s to working class people, hollowing out working-class communities, is not the way to decarbonise this country.” “There’s been a lot of talk about the transition to net zero, but the wind farms all around the coast are invariably built in China and Indonesia. Anywhere but the UK and they’re certainly not being built with UK components,” he added. Smith called for an “honest debate” on how environment policy is impacting jobs, “because it’s costing us jobs.”",
