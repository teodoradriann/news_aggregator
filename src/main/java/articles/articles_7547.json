    "text": "A relentless wave of stormy weather again brought heavy rain, hail and the slight possibility of tornadoes — this time to parts of the South — on Thursday evening in the fourth consecutive day of severe weather across the United States.\nThe storms this week have killed at least four people from the Plains to the East Coast and have damaged and flooded communities in at least 10 states. Here’s what you need to know for Thursday:\nMore than 17 million people from Central Texas to the Georgia coast were under an enhanced risk for severe weather, the third level of risk out of five, on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center .\nMore than 9 million people in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas were under severe thunderstorm watch es, meaning that conditions were favorable for thunderstorms with one inch hail or larger in diameter and winds of at least 58 miles an hour, according to the Weather Service .\nThe number of people under a tornado watch shrunk from millions in the afternoon to about 870,000 on Thursday evening in parts of Alabama, Georgia and Texas.\nIn Central and North Central Texas, a tornado watch was in effect until 9 p.m. local time. The worst of the storms was expected to start in the late afternoon and last until around 11 p.m., according to the National Weather Service .\nOn Thursday evening, about 110,000 customers across Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas were without power, according to Poweroutage.us .\nThe storms in the Midwest and South on Wednesday killed at least three people and brought intense rain, winds and hail to some areas. The previous day, widespread storms tore through the Midwest and tornadoes ripped through Michigan.\nOne storm-related death was reported in Gaston County, N.C., just west of Charlotte, while another person was killed in Claiborne County, in northeast Tennessee, after a tree fell on a vehicle. A third person died Wednesday evening in Maury County, Tenn., after a large tornado was spotted near Spring Hill, about 35 miles south of Nashville.\nMultiple cities across the region have also faced heavy rain that flooded roads and set off a wave of flood warnings and watches.\nEarlier this week, over a dozen tornadoes ripped through the Midwest , including in Michigan, where storms damaged nearly 200 mobile homes and temporarily trapped dozens of FedEx workers inside a building. One tornado that was up to two miles wide ripped through a community in Barnsdall, Okla., a city about 40 miles northwest of Tulsa, killing one person.\nThis week, the atmosphere has created the right ingredients for tornadoes. That includes warm, moist air close to the ground and cool, dry air higher up, along with vertical wind sheer, which is the change in wind speed or direction.\nTornado outbreaks like those over the last few days have become more common in recent decades, and scientists have been studying why they have been coming in bunches .\nResearchers are hesitant, however, to blame tornadoes’ clustering behavior on human-caused climate change.\nThe post Severe Weather Hits the South After 3 Days of Deadly Storms appeared first on New York Times .",

    "text": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : High drama prevailed in front of Mateer Memorial CSI Church at LMS Junction, Thiruvananthapuram, on Thursday evening when two sections of parishioners were engaged in a protest over church administration.\nTrouble started when former administrative secretary T T Praveen entered the church premises with a court order stating that Manoj Kumar Royce Victor, the incumbent Bishop, was asked to leave the church.\nThis led the dissidents who supported former CSI moderator and Bishop A Dharmaraj Rasalam and supporters of the incumbent bishop shouting slogans against each other. A huge posse of police from Museum Station rushed to the spot. Praveen ousted the incumbent bishop from his office which saw him getting into his car and deciding to leave the church. But a group of enraged followers urged him to continue there. Praveen claimed that Rasalam has managed to get a verdict in favour of him to continue as CSI Bishop from the Supreme Court. But those favouring Manoj Kumar Royce maintained that there was no such verdict from the Supreme Court.\nMuseum Police sub-Inspector Aneez told TNIE that Thiruvananthapuram sub-collector Ashwathy Srinivas has been asked by the state government to hold talks with the protesters.\n“Both sides are firm in their stand that they will not leave until the state government intervenes in the issue. They have been shouting slogans against each other. A huge posse of police is stationed here. We are hoping that the impasse will end once the sub-collector reaches the protest venue and holds discussions with the protesters,” said a police official.",

    "text": "Many Florida counties are under a state of emergency as forecasters monitor a tropical depression that is likely to form as soon as this weekend in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.\nGov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 54 of 67 counties Thursday afternoon, including the northern and northeastern counties of the state, the Panhandle, the western coast of the state and some areas of central Florida.\nBroward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties are not included in the executive order.\nThe well-defined\ntropical wave bringing stormy weather to Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and the Virgin Islands Thursday has high odds of developing into a tropical depression this weekend or early next week as it moves nearer to Florida, the far southwestern Atlantic and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said.\nThe Bahamas, Caribbean or Florida could be affected, though forecasters say it’s still too early to tell exactly what that would look like or whether the disturbance could become a hurricane.\nThe chances that the system could affect South Florida will become increasingly clear in the next few days. “Uncertainty is high,” meteorologists with the National Weather Service Miami wrote in a media release.\nDeSantis’s executive order Thursday afternoon said meteorologists’ reports show a significant threat of heavy rain throughout most of the state, possibly 12 inches of rain in the next week, which could lead to flooding and power outages.\nIts chance of developing in the next seven days were 70% as of 2 p.m. Thursday, up from 60% earlier in the morning and 20% Saturday morning. It has a 30% chance in the next two days, also up from 20% earlier in the morning.\nThe wave has been slow to develop because of dry air in the region, but it will be in more favorable conditions once over the warm waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane center said.\nFloridians should keep an eye on the weather forecast and plan accordingly. NWS Miami “will continue to provide updates as needed,” the weather service said.\nThe hurricane center said the southeastern U.S. is among the areas that should be “monitoring the system’s progress.”\n“Environmental conditions” do seem favorable during the weekend for more development, National Weather Service Senior Forecaster Anthony Reynes said, particularly weaker winds near the islands. Systems tend to become stronger when upper-level winds are not as strong, he said.\nIt is the first disturbance forecasters are watching in the Atlantic since\nHurricane Beryl formed in late June.\nEarlier in July, Colorado State University experts updated their hurricane season forecast, calling for\nan even busier season than the already “extremely active” forecast they earlier predicted.\nThe next storm to form would be named Debby.",
