    "text": "Reconoce INE a organizaciones de la sociedad civil por su apoyo en la participación ciudadana en las elecciones [FABIOLA P. CANEDO](https://www.google.com/search?as_sitesearch=elsiglodetorreon.com.mx&q=FABIOLA+P.+CANEDO) Coahuila tuvo una jornada histórica en la votación de las recientes elecciones, al crecer 8 puntos con respecto a la jornada electoral anterior, ello a pesar de que creció considerablemente el listado nominal. José Luis Vázquez López, vocal ejecutivo del INE en Coahuila, dijo que los resultados están a la altura de la entidad que más votó en México, que fue Yucatán, solo que aquel estado tuvo el aliciente más para acudir a las urnas, que fue la elección a gobernador. \"En general, aquí en Coahuila se votó al 65.65%, es una participación bastante buena, que creció en relación con hace seis años\", comentó, \"incluso hace seis años el promedio nacional fue 63, ahora fue 61 y Coahuila no nada más creció respecto a sí mismo, sino que creció respecto la media nacional en 5%, son realmente muy buenos números\". El Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) reconoció a una decena de organizaciones de la sociedad civil en la región lagunera, al considerar que sus actividades resultaron fundamentales para impulsar la participación ciudadana en el proceso electoral que concluyó. \"Reconociendo y agradeciéndole a las organizaciones su participación, de verdad que solamente así se explican los resultados que tenemos, el INE no pudiera haberlo hecho solo, fue por ellos\", expresó. Vázquez López dijo que en el 2018 votó el 63% del electorado, en la elección anterior, de 2023 a gobernador, se llegó al 57% de participación y en esta ocasión hay un 8% más de electores en el estado. El funcionario mencionó que se contó con el apoyo de 40 organizaciones de la sociedad civil, sindicatos, cámaras empresariales, colegios de profesionistas, clubes de servicio, universidades públicas y privadas, empresas en lo particular, que se sumaron a la actividad de promover la participación ciudadana. Destacó también el tema de los observadores electorales, donde se obtuvo el segundo lugar después de Estado de México, pero per cápita sería Coahuila el primer sitio, con 2,850 acreditados. No obstante estos excelentes resultados en este proceso electoral, recordó que hubo un 8.43% del total de las personas que se convocaron para hacerse cargo de la mesa directiva de casilla que no cumplieron con su deber ciudadano de estar ese día y, si bien ese porcentaje fue menor al presentado el año pasado y además es un dato que va en decrecimiento, sigue habiendo mucho por hacer en materia de educación cívica y formación de la ciudadanía. En su intervención, Luis Alfredo Medina López, coordinador de investigación en el Consejo Cívico de las Instituciones Laguna, señaló que en la elección a gobernador y diputados locales, La Laguna fue la región del estado que más participó, con un 61%, en esta elección a la presidencia de la República, senadores y alcaldías también volvió a ser la zona con más participación ciudadana, los cinco municipios alcanzaron 69.1%, es decir, 7 de cada 10 laguneros salieron a votar.",

    "text": "CNA Staff, Dec 29, 2023 / 06:00 am Pro-life institutions continued to be targets of pro-abortion attacks in 2023 following the landmark Supreme Court decision in June 2022 overturning Roe v. Wade. Roe, the 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide, was struck down on June 24 — the solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus — with the decision on the Mississippi abortion case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,” the majority opinion in the case said. Before Roe’s downfall, news of the imminent Dobbs opinion was [leaked to the media](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251115/supreme-court-will-overturn-roe-v-wade-according-to-draft-opinion). Enraged pro-abortion activists began [targeting Catholic churches](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251169/ruth-sent-us-abortion-group-threat-catholic-masses) as opportunities to disrupt worship.

    "text": "Cast and crew of \"The Substance,\" \"The Brutalist\" and more react to their nominations\nLOS ANGELES -- The nominees for the 97th Academy Awards were announced early Thursday morning. See here for the full list.\nFrom first-time nominees to multi-nominated cast and crew, these are their reactions.\n\"A Complete Unknown\" received eight Oscar nominations including three in the acting categories.\nBest actor nominee Timothée Chalamet had this to say about his nomination:\n\"I am enormously honored by this distinction. But most sincerely, I am OVERJOYED for the production's recognition today! I am so grateful for Monica Barbaro and Edward Norton's dedication to bring the folk icons Pete Seeger and Joan Baez to life. I am privileged to have worked alongside my friend Elle Fanning who is truly a generational talent. I am incredibly proud of our technical team and Arianne Phillips for bringing a fresh perspective to the 1960s. Most crucially, I am grateful to the GREAT JAMES MANGOLD, who guided this production with an experienced and masterful hand. And of course, none of this would have been possible without the incredible artist, poet, thinker, extraordinary unknown that is Mr. Bob Dylan (and Jeff Rosen for giving me the keys to the tour bus). For our film to be recognized by the Academy in this way is a testament to Bob's lasting legacy. Thank you!!!\"\nEdward Norton has been nominated four times for an Oscar. On this nomination, Norton says, \"I think in truth this is a compliment to our whole terrific ensemble of actors, which Jim Mangold directed so brilliantly. And if it helps connect more people to the inspiring life and spirit of Pete Seeger, even better. It was the greatest privilege to get to channel his beautiful spirit.\"\nSupporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro released this statement upon news of her nomination.\n\"I was literally floored upon receiving the news of this nomination - same as I was when Jim cast me in this film in the first place. Getting to be a part of this project has been the honor of a lifetime because of how much respect I have for Joan Baez and all the artists we portray in A COMPLETE UNKNOWN, as well as the artists I've gotten to collaborate with in the making of this film. I'm immensely proud of everyone involved in this movie, completely humbled to see my name amongst the actresses in this category who I hold in such high regard, and am deeply grateful to the Academy for this recognition of everyone's brilliant work.\"\nThis is the second nomination for writing and fifth overall for director and writer James Mangold, including his nominations this year. He released this statement.\n\"A COMPLETE UNKNOWN was a genuine act of faith on the part of so many. It was 6 years in the making and required a huge amount of dedication from our team and our brilliant cast. I am thrilled and elated with our 8 nominations! Much gratitude to Searchlight and Disney, my fellow producers, my co-writer Jay Cocks, to the Academy for this honor, to Timothée Chalamet for his partnership and friendship and of course for the trust that Bob Dylan extended to us I am forever grateful.\"\nCostume designer Arianne Phillips said of her nomination, \"I am still in shock, beyond thrilled and honored to be recognized alongside my friend and Director James Mangold. Especially being acknowledged for a film that has been a deeply personal and rewarding experience, AND after many delays, one that took us 5 years to make!\"\nThe film's producers Fred Berger and Alex Heineman released a statement about the acclaim.\n\"We're humbled and overwhelmed by the incredible recognition from the Academy, alongside films we admire so much. To play a small part in celebrating and sharing Bob Dylan's legacy has been a dream realized for all of us.Dylan's music and lyrics have resonated for over six decades because of his boundless creativity, singular artistry, and refusal to be boxed in. His constant evolution has served as inspiration to all of us who were fortunate to spend time in his orbit. We share this honor with our fellow producer and brilliant writer/director James Mangold, co-writer Jay Cocks, our extraordinary crew, and dream cast led by Timothée Chalamet, Edward Norton, Monica Barbaro, and Elle Fanning. Most importantly, we share this moment with our partner, the legendary Jeff Rosen who began this journey, and Bob Dylan himself, for all of his gifts.\"\nFirst-time Oscar nominee Zoe Saldaña released the following statement.\n\"I don't think I can properly express the deep levels of gratitude and joy I feel for the recognition EMILIA PÉREZ has been given. Being part of the beautiful family Jacques created was a dream and every single person involved poured their love into telling this powerful story. I'm especially grateful to Karla, whose bravery and talent brought so much depth and authenticity to 'Emilia'. It's a bittersweet moment as our community in Los Angeles is processing the heartbreaking losses from the ongoing fires - homes, schools, businesses and entire neighborhoods. My heart is with all those affected and I'm sending endless love and appreciation to our fearless first responders and everyone working to help rebuild our city.\"\nThe film also had nominations for Best Original Score and Best Original Songs and Camille and Clément Ducol released this statement.\n\"We are overwhelmed by these nominations. Music and community is our life and to be nominated in two music categories by our film music community surpasses anything we could have possibly imagined. We wholeheartedly thank The Academy and congratulate our fellow Emilia Perez nominees Jacques, Zoé, Karla Sofía, Paul, Juliette, Cyril and their teams. We are so proud of your bold and incredible work being recognized. We also owe a big thanks to Selena, Edgar, Adriana, Julia, Pierre Marie, and Pascal. Congrats to all the nominees!\"\n\"Wicked\" was a huge hit at the box office and has now earned ten Oscar nominations.\nSupporting actress nominee Ariana Grande posted her reaction to Instagram, saying in part, \"I cannot stop crying, to no one's surprise. I'm humbled and deeply honored to be in such brilliant company and sharing this with tiny Ari who sat and studied Judy Garland singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow just before the big, beautiful bubble entered. I'm so proud of you, Tiny. Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart, for this acknowledgement.\"\nShe acknowledged director Jon M. Chu, thanking him taking a chance on her and \"for being the most unbelievably brilliant leader, human being, and most fierce friend. i am so deeply proud of my beautiful Wicked family.\"\nShe also recognized costar Cynthia Erivo, saying, \"your brilliance is never ending and you deserve every flower (tulip) in every garden. i love you unconditionally, always.\"\nDirector Kelsey Mann and producer Mark Nielsen were feeling all the emotions on their nomination for Best Animated Film for \"Inside Out 2.\"\n\"Thank you to the Academy for this tremendous honor. Over the past few weeks we've had the opportunity to attend screenings and various talks and events for our film, and it's been a real inspiration to hear from audiences about how Inside Out 2 has affected them. People have shared stories about their own struggles with anxiety, or how the film inspired their child to better accept themselves, or from teachers who show the film in classrooms to incite discussions about emotions. Honestly, it makes us tear up hearing these things. We'd hoped to make a film that would entertain people and have a meaningful impact on the world, and what we've been hearing makes us feel like maybe we came close to doing just that. And a nomination like this? It's incredibly important as it underscores just how much the film did resonate. Thank you.\"\nNick Park and Merlin Crossingham released the following statement on their Best Animated Feature nomination.\n\"We are immensely honoured that our film has been nominated for an Academy Award, and it is especially meaningful to receive this recognition from our peers around the world. This nomination is a testament to the enduring love for Wallace & Gromit, as well as the incredible talent and hard work of our entire team, in the UK and beyond.\"\nJeremy Strong's statement on his Best Supporting Actor nomination for \"The Apprentice\" is as follows.\n\"This morning's nomination is indescribably meaningful to me. This film has been an uphill battle every step of the way and faced inestimable resistance on every front. It feels absolutely miraculous to me that both Sebastian and I were recognized. Roy Cohn's long, dark shadow was hanging over the Capitol Rotunda on Monday and his legacy of aggression, misinformation and untruth is now a Kingdom Come. This is a harrowing and courageous film that explores how we got to where we are today and was the role of a lifetime.\nToday's nomination is, without overstatement, a realization of a lifelong dream. I remember spending the night on cold metal bleachers outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1993 with my father to watch the actors and actresses arrive at the 65th Academy Awards. I remember being unable to sleep because of how exciting it was to be close to that world. I have not lost that feeling of excitement; I feel it every time I go to set or drive onto a lot or begin rehearsals. I have devoted my life to the attempt to do genuine work that would be worthy of this honor. I am filled with amazement and flooded with emotion and with deep gratitude to my peers in the Academy.\"\nBest Actor nominee Ralph Fiennes had this to say about \"Conclave\" and its eight nominations.\n\"I'm thrilled to be nominated and to be celebrating the other nominations for Conclave. Edward Berger brought an extraordinary cast and crew together - he is an inspirational director with rare insight and a unique vision which lies at the heart of this film.\"\n\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" Visual Effects supervisor Erik Winquist released a statement on behalf of himself and his colleagues Paul Story and Stephen Unterfranz on their nomination.\n\"We were thrilled to wake up to the good news this morning. It is an honour getting to represent the more than a thousand artists, developers, production, and support crew who worked their magic for over a year on Kingdom. Collaborating with Wes Ball and 20th Century on this was a delight and it's so satisfying to see our work recognised by the Academy. We're looking forward to celebrating this past year of cinema on March 2nd.\"\nSongwriter Diane Warren is celebrating her 16th Oscar nomination in the Original Song Category. She had this to say about today's news.\n\"I'm so proud and honored to be nominated for my song 'The Journey' from Tyler Perry's Netflix film The Six Triple Eight. Inspired by the powerful true story of these incredible women and brought to life with perfection by the amazing artist H.E.R., this song about resilience resonates within the movie and in life. We are all on our own Journey.\"\n\"I'm Still Here\" producers Maria Carlota Bruno and Rodrigo Teixeira released this statement.\n\"It is with great emotion that we receive the three nominations: Best International Feature Film, Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Picture. This achievement was only possible thanks to Walter Salles's masterful direction in bringing \"I'm Still Here\" to life, to the talent and dedication of Fernanda Torres, of Selton Mello, and of the entire cast and crew, as well as to the special participation of Fernanda Montenegro. None of this would have been possible without Marcelo Rubens Paiva's book and the support of the Rubens Paiva family. It is wonderful to see their story reach so many people, not only in Brazil but also abroad. This is the first time a Brazilian film has been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. \"I'm Still Here\" has already made history in Brazil, with over 3.6 million viewers, and we hope these nominations will make the film travel even further, allowing more people to learn about this cruel chapter in our country's history and to recognize the essential value of democracy.\"\nAnd Best Actress nominee Fernanda Torres had this to say about her achievement:\n\"I am deeply humbled by the Academy's recognition and honored to stand alongside the remarkable women in this category. Portraying Eunice Paiva was an immense privilege, as it allowed me to embody a woman whose life was defined by extraordinary resilience and a quiet, unwavering strength. To stand here today, representing Brazil in a lineage that began with my mother's trailblazing journey, is both surreal and deeply moving. I would like to express my gratitude to both Walter Salles, who brought this story to the screen with such sensitivity and artistry, and Marcelo Rubens Paiva, whose memoir provided the foundation for us to share his family's story. This moment belongs to all of us.\"\nDemi Moore, who received her first-ever Oscar nomination for Actress in a Leading Role in \"The Substance\" released the following statement.\n\"Being nominated for an Oscar is an incredible honor and these last few months have been beyond my wildest dreams. Truly there are no words to fully express my joy and overwhelming gratitude for this recognition. Not only for me but for what this film represents. I am deeply humbled. This is a time of incredible contrasts and right now, my heart is with my friends, family, neighbors, and community here in LA. The fires have devastated so many lives but to see the way our community has united leaves me in awe of the resilience and compassion that defines us, and this moment is a reminder of how incredible we are when we stand together.\"\nDirector Coralie Fargea told ABC News, \"I think we are used to putting people into boxes. If you are this, then you can't do that, or if you look like that, you can't do that, and I think this movie is about exploding the boxed.\"\nMikey Madison, who starred in \"Anora\" was also nominated for her first Oscar, in the Actress in a Leading Role category.\nMadison said to ABC News \"I'm absolutely floating right now... I think I was watching you guys. I was in bed in my hotel, facetime with my mom... She was crying, and it was very sweet and then she immediately humbled me by saying in the same sentence, 'Oh congrats sweeties. I love you so much. Also, you need to take your dog to obedience training.'\"\nYura Borasov was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, telling ABC News \"My wife was screaming. I lost (concentration for) every nomination after that because my wife was screaming (for) an hour after that.\"\n\"The Brutalist\" was nominated for 10 Oscars.\nThis marks Adrien Brody's second nomination. He won in 2002 for his leading role in \"The Pianist.\"\nHe said, \"Thank you to all my peers and colleagues at the Academy for this extraordinary honor. For almost four decades, I've experienced the peaks and valleys of being an artist. It's given me perspective and a tremendous appreciation and respect for this moment.\nPortraying Laszlo Toth, and representing the hardships and yearnings of so many, including the very struggles of my own family, has rekindled my own sense of being and belonging, and believing again.\nSharing this profound experience with our talented and dedicated cast and crew on THE BRUTALIST has been a rare gift that I am endlessly grateful for. Thank you for honoring us all with this recognition, I am only here through the support of many; I am truly humbled and will cherish this momentous occasion forever.\"\nDirector Brady Corbet released a statement with Mona Fastvold. The two were nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture.\n\"On behalf of our entire team, we are so incredibly touched. We did not make this film with any such a destination in mind but having received the news this morning, can only thank our endlessly dedicated crew made up of individuals from all over the world, especially our Hungarian team who we hoped to faithfully honor by the portrayals of Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones's characterizations of their roles.\nI'd like to use this opportunity to highlight the work of Viktória Petrányi and her extraordinary team at Proton Cinema in Budapest whom this film simply would not exist without.\nMona and I are endlessly grateful to the Academy and A24 and Universal International for guiding us through this journey.\"\nDaniel Blumberg was nominated for Best Original Score, stating, \"Thank you very much to the Academy, I really appreciate the work being recognised like this, and I'm so proud of my friend Brady for making this film. Thank you to Peter Walsh and some of my favourite musicians, including the legendary John Tilbury, for their huge contributions to the score.\"\nCinematographer Lol Crawley released the following statement for his Best Cinematography nomination:\n\"It is such an incredible honour to be recognised by my peers in the Academy, thank you for this nomination. Photographing this film for Brady was an extraordinary challenge but the most wonderful collaboration. This recognition means the world to me.\"\nJudy Becker was nominated for Best Production design. \"I am so honored to be nominated by my peers in the Academy for my work on The Brutalist. Designing this film was an amazing experience, and a true labor of love. This recognition means everything to me. And a massive congratulations and thanks to my director, Brady Corbet\"\nColman Domingo was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his work in \"Sing Sing.\" This is his second nomination. He was also nominated last year for his role in \"Rustin.\"\n\"To be back again at the Oscar nominations table is truly meaningful to me, especially for the work that \"Sing Sing\" represents. Work which truly hopes to shine bright loving light into dark places by using art. I am so thrilled for our company which also received nominations for adapted screenplay and original song. All of that work is so tender and hopeful just like our film. I couldn't be prouder as an actor or producer.\"\n\"I Am Ready, Warden\" was nominated for Best Documentary Short Film.\nDirector Smriti Mundhra and producer Maya Gnyp released the following statement:\n\"On behalf of our incredible partners at MTV Documentary Films and executive producer Sheila Nevins, we are so thankful to the Academy and deeply humbled by this recognition. In polarized times, acts of grace and forgiveness remind us of our shared humanity, and we are eternally grateful to John Henry Ramirez and Aaron Castro, for showing us that hope exists even in a place like Texas death row. Congratulations to our fellow nominees - we are honored to be in your company, and to share the power of short documentaries with the broader film community.\"\nThe 97th Oscars Awards, hosted by Conan O'Brien, begin at 7 p.m. ET | 4 p.m. PT on ABC.\nThe Walt Disney Company is the parent company of ABC and this ABC station.",

    "title": "Ten ways to make your home freeze-resilient in a cold snap",
    "text": "With Arctic air hitting, it’s probably best to stay indoors if you can.\nBut in freezing conditions, your home needs to be ready for the icy snap too.\nFrom frozen pipes to broken boilers, there’s plenty to consider when making your home the safest space when it’s sub-zero outside. New research has found homeowners aged over 65 worry the most about how to cope in cold weather, feeling particularly concerned about power cuts, broken boilers and frozen pipes.\n“We know people can often dread cold weather but just by following a few simple tips they can make their homes more resilient to the cold to keep both the home, and those living there, cosy,” says Saga’s home product manager Anna Thunstrom.\nHowever, it’s important to make sure your home is freeze-resilient whatever your age, and Andy Simms, a building expert from MyBuilder.com, says: “Cold weather can wreak havoc on our homes. As always, preparing for the weather in advance is always the best option — but there are some last-minute jobs you can do to protect your home.\n“Frozen pipes are a particular pain and can cause plenty of issues with leaks long after the cold weather has left. But if you follow some top tips your home will be well-prepared for the cold weather.”\nHere are the experts’ tips on how to make your home freeze-resilient…\nA burst water pipe on your property is your responsibility, and cold snaps in winter is when you’re most at risk of this, warns property and construction expert Thomas Goodman from MyJobQuote. “Uninsulated pipes in colder parts of the home, such as the loft or basement, are the most likely pipes to burst.”\nGoodman says insulating tubes are relatively cheap, and you can buy them from most DIY shops. “It’s important to wrap your pipes,” he stresses. “This will prevent them from freezing and will also prevent heat loss.”\nHe advises householders to make a particular effort to insulate pipes that take hot water from the cylinder or boiler to the hot water taps. These pipes are usually next to the boiler, in the airing cupboard, and under the bathroom and kitchen sinks.\nIf the weather is predicted to be extra cold on any night, turn on any taps that are along an exterior wall and allow them to drip, Goodman advises. “Allowing your faucets to drip will eliminate pressure building between your tap and any potential ice blockages,” he explains. “This means that even if the pipe does freeze, it will be much less likely to burst.”\nFrozen outdoor taps can add serious pressure to your internal pipes, warns Simms. It’s good practice to disconnect any hosepipes over winter as well as insulating any outdoor taps, he says.\n“Keeping your taps safe in the winter is simple with a £5 tap jacket. This simple insulated protector cover can save you from a whole host of problems if the worst were to happen to an exposed outdoor tap.”\nThese can monitor your usual water use and can turn off the water if they detect a leak, Thunstrom advises. Alternatively, use your water meter to check for leaks.\nSo many homeowners don't know the location of their stopcock. If you have an emergency from a broken outdoor tap, you’ll quickly need to know where your stopcock is located, says Simms.\n“It’s also advisable to turn your water off at the stopcock if going away for a lengthy period, especially over the winter months as this will prevent any leaks or burst pipes.”\nAs well as insulating pipes internally and externally, exterior walls, water tanks and your attic/loft space should also be well insulated, advises Simms. “Good insulation also protects your home from hot weather, so it’s worth the investment,” he says.\nSaga advises that paving or tarmac can be cleared of snow and ice using sand, grit, or salt.\n“Ordinary table or dishwasher salt is fine, but don’t take the rock salt from salting bins to use on private paths and pavements, as this is needed to keep roads clear,” warns Thunstrom.\nThe last thing anyone needs when the temperature plunges is a broken boiler, stresses Simms. “An annual boiler service will ensure any potential issues are nipped in the bud,” he says. “Should your boiler break during freezing weather, you’ll not only be facing a cold house, but it could lead to burst pipes should the water inside them freeze.”\nKeep your thermostat on around 12-15 degrees when you’re away from your home, advises Simms. “While it’s understandable that homeowners don’t want to spend money on heating an empty home, it’s important to maintain a reasonable temperature while you’re away.”\nHe says if you don’t have a thermostat, you can use the timer on your boiler to get the heating to come on for a short time every day.\nAnother option for a thermostat or timer is using smart technology to control the temperature of your home. Simms says: “You can use the remote thermostat to set the temperature you prefer, wherever you are and whenever you want.”",

    "text": "Je suis médecin spécialiste, je suis pédiatre.\nAujourd’hui, je vous parle de moi, de nous, mais surtout d’eux. Je suis pédiatre. Jour après jour, je travaille sans relâche pour soigner la génération de demain. Nos enfants. Ceux que l’on veut voir fleurir.\nJe suis née dans les années 90. Je suis millénariale. Je fais partie de la dernière génération qui n’est pas née avec un téléphone intelligent dans les mains. J’ai eu mon premier téléphone portable à clavier en 2007, en quatrième secondaire.\nLes temps changent\nAvec l’arrivée de l’été et les vacances, offrons aux enfants et adolescents de revenir à l’essentiel. Étant donné que les téléphones intelligents seront interdits dans les écoles, profitons de l’été pour nous pratiquer. Je trouve cette idée géniale... pas vous?\nLes temps ont changé: aujourd’hui, un enfant de 18 mois est pratiquement capable de déverrouiller un smartphone.\nEst-ce qu’on s’en va directement dans un mur? J’ose espérer que nous allons réagir et que nous sommes maintenant à la croisée des chemins. Mais, il y a urgence d’agir. Nous sommes devant une potentielle pandémie. Nous sommes face à une problématique de santé publique de cyberdépendance certes, mais surtout de pression de performance et d’individualisme de notre société.\nComme société, nous tenons à bout de bras nos enfants, notre carrière, notre santé globale, notre vie. À quel prix?\nActuellement, on expose nos enfants aux écrans, car personne n’est là pour prendre soin d’eux à notre place lorsqu’il le faut. Notre société nous laisse tomber. Nous sommes isolés. Il est prouvé que l’esprit de communauté est un des déterminants de santé les plus importants.\nOù allons-nous?\nLa situation actuelle est préoccupante. Nos émotions vont dans tous les sens, car on ne les autorégule plus. Notre développement affectif est altéré par notre relation avec les écrans. Notre attachement est insécure, évitant.\nNous ne développons plus notre plein potentiel, mais les compagnies technologiques développent des outils qui nous rendent de plus en plus accros chaque jour à une\nsécrétion superflue de dopamine. Il est temps de nous dire que c’est assez pour nos enfants. Enfin!\nNous devons développer des stratégies concrètes afin de contrôler la cyberdépendance :\n- Il faut d’abord reconnaître que nos écrans attirent de façon incontrôlable notre attention.\n- Il faut cesser de diaboliser les écrans et plutôt poser des actions afin de les encadrer.\n- Les écrans doivent être utilisés judicieusement afin de stimuler le développement.\n- Il faut apprendre à s’aimer comme individu et comme société.\n- Il est aussi important de ralentir notre rythme de vie.\n- Si nous sommes un parent seul, il ne faut pas se gêner pour demander de l’aide.\n- Finalement, il est essentiel de miser sur nos capacités HUMAINES: l’entraide, la communauté, le rire, le jeu, et garder notre cœur d’enfant.\nL’avenir de la société n’est pas juste entre mes mains. Elle est dans les nôtres. À nous de poser un regard critique sur ce que nous désirons améliorer.\nCommençons dès maintenant pour que nos soleils brillent de santé.\nKarina D. Poliquin\nPédiatre, MD, FRCP\nPartenaire Enfant Soleil\nAmbassadrice de la Fondation Dr Clown",

    "text": "2023-12-24 08:34:00 The great actress Brigitte Bardot: “I don’t want to die in an Islamized France” “There was a time when I would have said that I didn’t want to live in an Islamized France. Today I say that I don’t want to die in an Islamized France!” Brigitte Bardot said this in an interview with the ultra-conservative weekly Valeurs Actuelles. “The murderers – he explains – are often of Islamic origin and they claim it! Unfortunately, for the most part, they are français de papier (immigrants who only have a French document, ed.) and often psychopaths. We should carry out a psychiatric examination on all migrants who enter before granting them the right to asylum and French nationality,” says Bardot. According to the great actress, the problem “it is Islam in general, the Islamist invasion, which are frighteningly dangerous for French identity and culture”. To demonstrate that our culture is in check, the Corriere della Sera reports, according to Bardot, there is the attack that Christmas is undergoing: “Here is another of those innovations that come out of the sick brains of our contemporaries who dirty everything that it is beautiful, pure, true, to modernize and globalize ancestral and traditional values that it would be a sacrilege to touch. “Wokism” is a ridiculous trend. I do not accept that the sublime is soiled or ridiculed.” Bardot is also critical of Pope Francis: “I can’t see it. It does a lot of harm to the Church. I adored John Paul II, I remember our beautiful meeting, unique, very warm, he was not a politician at all. I will never meet the current Pope.” We read in Corriere della Sera, “among his criticisms of the Pontiff is the fact that he did not respond to his letters. «He does not deal with the Christians of the East and never talks about them. When I learned that his name would be Francis, I said full of hope: if he chose this name, it is because he loves animals. I sent him a letter to congratulate and thank him for choosing that name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. I finally hoped that he would do something more to improve the fate of animals in the world, but he never replied to me. I sent him another letter, and he had one of his collaborators reply to me who thanked me, and blah blah. I therefore find him to be very rude.” Subscribe to the newsletter #Brigitte #Bardot #dont #die #Islamized #France #Pope #evil",
