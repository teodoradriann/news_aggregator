    "title": "Kate Paye becomes new Stanford women's head basketball coach",
    "text": "| | Getting your A small Stanford conference room filled with applause and cheers as Kate Paye approached a black table at the front of a crowd Wednesday. She smiled and waved eagerly. “Tara, I think I have more people here than you did,” Paye said at the press conference, sending the crowd into laughter. Stanford officially named Paye as the Setsuko Ishiyama Director of Women’s Basketball, or coach, on April 17. Paye, a former Stanford women’s basketball player and former assistant coach, [succeeds Tara VanDerveer](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/stanford-university/2024/04/09/tara-vanderveer-who-set-ncaa-record-for-wins-announces-retirement/) who has coached the team since 1985 and set an NCAA record for wins. Paye’s voice wavered as she thanked the Ishiyama family and her wife and kids for their ongoing support in pursuing her dream. “I am grateful and humbled to be asked to lead Stanford’s women’s basketball, a program that has meant so much to me for over 40 years,” she said. “I assure you all, you could not have found anyone who feels a greater sense of honor, privilege, responsibility, enthusiasm and passion to lead Stanford women’s basketball.” Her’s is a Stanford story, she said. Paye’s mother, Anne Paye, got her masters in English literature at Stanford and was passionate about education, sports and empowering women. Her father, John Paye, played football at Stanford and was a political science major, who believed basketball could take Kate places. Paye’s older brother John was a Stanford starting quarterback and point guard, one of her most influential coaches. And her older sister Amy Paye Venuto, was a double major at the university, who currently serves on the Buck/Cardinal Club Board and as the Paye family’s glue. “Since I was a young girl, I dreamed of being a part of this program and I’ve gotten to do that now as a player, an alum and for the last 17 years, as a coach,” she said. Upon graduating from Stanford, Paye didn’t see coaching in her future. She briefly played basketball professionally and tried working as a Silicon Valley corporate attorney, but only lasted six months before being invited back to the place she loves most by VanDerveer. Today, she feels “very prepared,” for her new position. Moving forward, Paye plans to lean into continuity and rely on the foundation that has been laid by VanDerveer. The team’s entire staff has agreed to stay on board after the transition, and she promoted Jennette Poland from director of player development to assistant coach. “Teammates, alums, players I’ve coached and coaches I’ve coached with,” Paye said. “As I sit here today, I know I am not up here alone, I am here with and for my Stanford sisters.”",

    "text": "Le pasteur Laxa Wejieme célèbre une messe sur un barrage à Dumbéa, le 2 juin 2024 en Nouvelle-Calédonie ( AFP / Delphine Mayeur )\nDrôle d'endroit pour une messe. Mais après presque trois semaines de contestation et de violences, il y avait urgence. Alors ce dimanche, Laxa Wejieme a convié ses ouailles à célébrer la messe sur un barrage de Dumbéa, au milieu des débris de verre et des gravats.\nLe message du pasteur de l'Eglise protestante de Kanaky Nouvelle-Calédonie (EPKNC) sera simple mais ambitieux. Porter des paroles \"d'apaisement, de réconciliation et montrer la voix de la sagesse\".\nDès le début de la matinée, les habitants du quartier populaire de Jacarandas, dans cette commune située au nord de l'agglomération de Nouméa, se pressent autour du rond-point pour décorer de fleurs et de feuilles un petit chapiteau érigé pour abriter l'autel.\nPour la cérémonie, une boîte de morceaux de pain de mie en guise d'hosties et une carafe d'eau citronnée: la vente d'alcool a été interdite dans tout l'archipel français du Pacifique Sud dès le début des violences...\nDes habitantes du quartier de Jacaranda, chantent lors d'une messe célébrée sur un barrage à Dumbéa, le 2 juin 20244 en Nouvelle-Calédonie ( AFP / Delphine Mayeur )\nL'assemblée est vêtue de bleu et de mauve, les couleurs \"de l'espoir, de la paix et de la liberté\", celles du jacaranda qui a donné son nom au quartier mais aussi \"celles du Wetr\", le district nord de l’île de Lifou dont sont originaires de nombreux habitants du quartier.\nAutour du rond-point flottent les drapeaux indépendantistes vert, rouge, bleu et jaune frappés de la flèche faîtière.\nAvec d'autres \"mamans\", Mathilde a tenu à partager ce moment de recueillement rare depuis le début des violences causées par la réforme électorale rejetée par les indépendantistes.\n- \"Stop !\" - \"Il faut encourager les jeunes\", dit-elle, \"pas dans le sens de faire de la violence mais dans le sens de ne pas se tromper de combat\".\nLe pasteur Laxa Wejieme célèbre une messe sur un barrage à Dumbéa, le 2 juin 2024 en Nouvelle-Calédonie ( AFP / Delphine Mayeur )\nLes jeunes, justement, sont installés à quelques mètres de là, sur une petite butte surplombant le rond-point.\nAucun ne souhaite s'exprimer, échaudés par les \"fausses informations\" qu'ils estiment véhiculés par les médias, notamment au sujet de nombre de morts qu'ils assurent nettement plus élevé que le bilan officiel de sept.\nEn contrebas, donc, l'office a débuté.\nDevant une petite centaine de personnes de tous âges, le pasteur, un Kanak originaire lui aussi de Lifou, entame ses prédications. \"Il faut revenir à la raison et enlever l'alcool, c'est ça qui nous tue. Soyons intelligent ! STOP ! changeons de direction !\", lance-t-il d'une voix forte.\nDes bloqueurs de route (en haut) installés près d'une école avec une banderole \"Non au dégel, ici c'est Kanaky\", observent une messe célébrée par un pasteur, pour délivrer un message d'apaisement aux jeunes qui tiennent les barricades du quartier à Dumbéa, le 2 juin 2024 en Nouvelle-Calédonie ( AFP / Delphine Mayeur )\nL'assemblée approuve, les jeunes d'en-haut aussi.\n\"A quoi sert la violence ? Ça mène à quoi ? C'est nous les perdants\", poursuit le pasteur Wejieme, dont l'église a pris dès 1979 fait et cause pour l'indépendance.\nUne détonation se fait entendre au loin, suivie d'une forte rafale de vent qui menace d'emporter le temple improvisé. \"Un signe divin\", interprète le religieux, sur ce \"beau lieu\" où il \"a rencontré le seigneur\".\nPour l'occasion, le rond-point est rebaptisé Hnakano, l'endroit où l'on tourne en drehu, la langue de Lifou.\n- \"J'ai très, très peur\" - Le pasteur poursuit. Le discours est à la concorde.\nLe pasteur Laxa Wejieme célèbre une messe sur un barrage à Dumbéa, le 2 juin 2024 en Nouvelle-Calédonie ( AFP / Delphine Mayeur )\n\"Nous avons été souillés par la haine et la colère (mais) nous avons besoin de l'autre. J'ai besoin de toi frère wallisien, frère tahitien, frère européen. On veut un destin commun. On veut que le frère d'à côté mange le pain que j'ai fabriqué\".\nDans l'assistance, Pascal opine. Lui qui vit depuis vingt-quatre ans à Jacarandas voit les émeutes comme un \"cri d'alarme\" qui doit ouvrir les yeux des Calédoniens et les pousser à se \"parler avec le cœur\".\nMais autour de lui, l'inquiétude domine. \"Si le corps électoral est dégelé, ça va nous faire revenir des années en arrière\", redoute Jacqueline, la cinquantaine.\nComme elle, de nombreux parents ont peur pour leurs enfants et ont du mal à fermer l'œil la nuit venue. \"Ils sont là pour nous protéger de la milice. Ils rentrent dans le quartier et tirent sur n’importe quoi\", raconte-t-elle.\nUn barrage sur une route du quartier de Jacaranda, le 2 juin 2024 à Dumbéa, en Nouvelle-Calédonie ( AFP / Delphine Mayeur )\n\"J'ai très, très peur\", abonde Pascal, dont l'un des fils récemment revenu de l'Hexagone a rejoint le barrage. \"C'est mon aîné et il a une grande famille\", poursuit-il. \"Il faut que nous soyons à ses côtés pour l'accompagner, pour l'aider à prendre notre relève\".\nLa cérémonie s'achève en chanson pendant que des marmites sont installées sur des tables.\nCes derniers jours, les femmes du quartier ont organisé des bingos pour offrir le repas, partagé simplement à même le rond-point. Les jeunes descendent y chercher leurs assiettes puis remontent pour tenir leur position.",

    "text": "LEBANON, Ind. (WLFI) - The Lebanon Mayor's office confirms statements made by Mayor Matt Gentry regarding the timeline of finding a citywide water solution. Mayor Gentry previously told News 18 Lebanon has always been faced with water supply challenges based on its location, and the way water sources flow away from it. On [episode 169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsMyDC3-zP4) of the Lovein Lebanon Podcast, Gentry said the best way to overcome the water issue was to use money they receive from incoming investments to pay for it. \"Water rates would go up, we'd have to fund the pipeline ourselves,\" he said in the podcast. \"Having these massive levels of investments that are being talked about in LEAP, and the investments that Lilly is making in LEAP, that will help create that base and demand that will allow us to fund those infrastructure pieces without burdening the rate payers.\" Gentry adds there's a line of developments waiting to get into the LEAP District in Lebanon. He said as soon as the city finds water sources to support these projects, they will be able to begin the next steps of development. Gentry made comments in a report to the Lebanon Reporter saying \"the city is 'a lot closer' to a water solution after negotiations with Central Indiana utilities companies.\" \"We hope to have a path forward before the end of summer. I can't get into specifics, but it's a dramatic increase from where we are today,\" he continued. The Lebanon Mayors office confirmed to News 18 Gentry's comments are true. The report also mentions that potential amount could additionally supply industrial and residential growth in Lebanon. Tippecanoe County Commissioner, Dave Byers, said he and the other commissioners still aren't convinced that the project wouldn't require the use of water in Tippecanoe County. \"You don't just go making promises when you know there's problems down there. I don't think we're over the hump, and I don't think we're clear yet,\" he said. The Lebanon Mayor's Office said Gentry prefers not to comment at this time because \"the water topic remains uncertain.\" They said Mayor Gentry would prefer to wait until a definite decision is made before commenting They told News 18 when a decision is made, they will provide us with the information.",
