    "text": "Primary care is the foundation of Alberta’s health care system, and family physicians are fundamental to Albertans getting the care they need when and where they need it. That’s why Alberta’s government is pulling out all the stops to stabilize, strengthen and improve Alberta's primary health care system. The additional one-time funding has been provided to the Alberta Medical Association (AMA) as part of a December 2023 commitment of $200 million over two years to stabilize primary health care. The AMA will distribute the funding to eligible family physicians and rural generalists. “We heard what primary care physicians told us about the challenges they are facing, and we’ve taken action to address those challenges. Alberta’s government is pleased to provide this one-time funding to support family physicians and rural generalists until a new physician comprehensive care model is introduced.” Approximately 3,000 family doctors are eligible to receive transition funding of $24,000 to $40,000. The amount a family physician and rural generalist will receive depends on the number of patients they have. The funding is a one-time payment aimed at helping family doctors and rural generalists until a new compensation model is in place. It will be used for administrative and equipment costs related to the number of patients they manage. “We are grateful that this funding will help family and rural generalist physicians remain in comprehensive, life-long care as we move to the next phase of collaboration with the minister and her team. For this stabilization investment to reap benefits for Albertans, we must rapidly implement the new payment model that will allow comprehensive care to flourish across the province.” This funding is enabled through the new Canada-Alberta Health Funding Agreement with the federal government. The agreement represents a total of about $1.1 billion in additional health care funding over three years for shared priorities. Quick facts - Stabilization funding is a transitional measure identified through work under the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the minister of health and the Alberta Medical Association that was signed in fall 2023. - In December, $200 million over two years was announced to help stabilize primary care. This includes the $92 million announced April 4 and $8 million for the residency incentive program. - Other recently announced supports for primary health care include: - Providing ongoing base compensation for primary care physicians that is expected to be more than $2.3 billion in 2024-25. - Committing to create a primary-care organization within the refocused provincial health care system to co-ordinate primary health care services and provide transparent provincial oversight, with the goal of ensuring every Albertan will have a family physician or primary care provider. - Investing $40 million over two years to support Primary Care Networks. - Investing $12 million for the Community Information Integration and Central Patient Attachment Registry, enabling doctors and their teams to share patient information from their electronic medical record to Alberta Netcare. - Committing to implement recommendations from the Modernizing Alberta's Primary Health Care System initiative through a phased approach. - Creating a primary health care division within Alberta Health.

    "text": "CROWN POINT — A Lake Criminal Court jury found a Gary man guilty Wednesday of shooting a police K-9 and pointing his gun at an officer during a pursuit last summer. However, they found him not guilty of attempted murder on the officer. Spencer Patterson, 30, was found guilty of felony attempted battery by means of a deadly weapon, resisting law enforcement, striking a law enforcement animal and misdemeanor resisting law enforcement. Striking a law enforcement animal and resisting law enforcement are level six felonies, which carry a possible sentence of between six months to two-and-a-half years in jail or prison. Attempted battery by means of a deadly weapon is a level five felony, which carries between one and six years in prison. He faces up to a year in jail on the misdemeanor charge. During the two-day trial in Lake Criminal Court Judge Salvador Vasquez's courtroom, jurors heard witness testimony from police officers and a Lake County sheriff's detective, saw photos from the crime scene and listened to audio from dispatchers who communicated with officers during the incident. People are also reading… Gary police Sgt. Angel Lozano tried to arrest Patterson while on shift July 13 after he received information that Patterson's car was in an area nearby and he had a warrant out for his arrest. Patterson fled the scene on foot, so Lozano and his K-9 Falco chased him down. The dog bit Patterson, so he fired multiple fatal shots at the dog. He then shot at Lozano. Patterson's defense attorney John Cantrell said at trial that there is no physical evidence that Patterson shot at Gary police Sgt. Angel Lozano during the chase. Lozano testified Tuesday that he and his K-9 Falco were running after Patterson in the 1000 block of East 35th Place and Falco ran ahead of Lozano to catch up with Patterson. Falco followed Patterson into a nearby backyard. Lozano heard several shots fired and said he located his dog in the backyard moments later, dead. Lozano said he then heard rustling from nearby and slowly crept along the side wall of the home to the west side of the residence. He peeked around the corner of the house and saw Patterson on the ground with a black firearm, supposedly pointed straight at him. Patterson fired, he said. Cantrell said in a text message Thursday morning that he and Patterson maintain Patterson's innocence on that accusation, despite the fact that he respects the jury's verdict. \"There was no physical evidence to support that my client fired a gun,\" Cantrell said. \"No shell casings were located, even after the police brought out a metal detector.\" Patterson's sentencing hearing is set for July 12, Cantrell said.

    "title": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash",
    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

(Vedanta) at its Surla-Sonshi mining site.\nRaising the issue during Zero Hour in the Goa Assembly, Alemao criticised the layoffs as unjust and ill-timed, especially at a time when the state is actively working to revive mining operations.\n“In a hastily convened meeting with the workers’ union, company officials announced the retrenchment,” Alemao told the House, adding that the move came just three days before a scheduled High Court hearing on July 29.\nHe pointed out that the matter is already sub judice, with the court having earlier stayed a previous retrenchment attempt. Alemao questioned the rationale behind the job cuts at a time when the government has expressed confidence about restarting full-scale mining activity.\n“If the government is committed to reviving mining, why are workers being shown the door?” he asked.\nResponding to the concern, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant assured the Assembly that the government would examine the matter and take appropriate steps to address the retrenchment issue.",
