    "text": "قالت أخصائية التغذية الأمريكية ماريسا كارب إن أحد الأخطاء الشائعة في وجبة الإفطار هو قلة تناول البروتين صباحا، مما يؤدي إلى انخفاض الطاقة في منتصف النهار وبالتالي الرغبة في تناول الوجبات الخفيفة بعد الظهر.\nوأضافت: \"غالبا ما يكون الإفطار هو الوجبة الأكثر غنى بالكربوهيدرات خلال اليوم، ويشمل ذلك أطعمة مثل الخبز المحمص، حبوب الإفطار، المعجنات، أو حتى مجرد القهوة\"، وفقا لموقع \"فوكس نيوز\".\nوتابعت: \"هذه الخيارات سريعة، لكنها عادةً ما تكون منخفضة البروتين، وقد تُشعرك بالجوع مرة أخرى في غضون ساعة أو ساعتين\".\nويستغرق البروتين وقتاً أطول في الهضم من الكربوهيدرات البسيطة، ما يعني أنه يُمكنه كبح الشهية لفترة أطول.\nكما أنه يؤدي دورا رئيسيا في إنتاج النواقل العصبية مثل الدوبامين والسيروتونين، والتي تؤثر على المزاج، والتركيز، والصحة العقلية بشكل عام، كما قالت كارب.\nوأضافت أخصائية التغذية: \"إن بدء يومك بالبروتين يمنح دماغك العناصر الأساسية التي يحتاجها لدعم أمور مثل الذاكرة، والتوازن العاطفي، وصفاء الذهن\".\nونظراً لدوره في تنظيم سكر الدم، يحافظ البروتين في الصباح على ثبات الطاقة طوال اليوم، وهو أمر أساسي لمزاج إيجابي.\nويوصي خبراء التغذية بتناول 20 إلى 30 جرام من البروتين على الإفطار.\nويمكن الحصول على قدر وفير من البروتين بتناول أطعمة مثل الفول، والبيض، والحب، مع كوب من الحليب أو اللبن (الزبادي). كما ينبغي أن يحتوي الإفطار على ألياف توفرها البقول أو الخضراوات.\nولا تعتبر حبوب الإفطار أو الحلويات، أو المعجنات من العناصر الأساسية في إفطار صحي.\nاقرأ أيضا:\nنوع أعشاب احذر الإكثار منه.. يضعف القدرة الجنسية ويقلل الحيوانات المنوية\n\"دون تحكم بشري\".. روبوتات تتنافس في أول دوري كرة قدم\n\"الأغلى في العالم\".. 10 صور لكعكة زفاف الملياردير جيف بيزوس",

    "text": "El pedido de Colón no prosperó y la AFA decretó su descenso a la Primera Nacional La decisión fue tomada oficial y administrativamente por el Tribunal de Penas y la cantidad de equipos en la Liga Profesional siguen siendo 28. A casi un mes del infartante desempate por la permanencia en Primera división entre Gimnasia y Colón, que decretó el descenso del Sabalero, el Tribunal de Disciplina tomó en las últimas horas una decisión con respecto a la presentación que hizo el club santafesino buscando anular el descenso a la Primera Nacional: como era de esperarse, no harán lugar al pedido y Colón jugará en segunda catagoría el año que viene. Horas después del partido que se disputó en cancha de Newell's y terminó 1-0 a favor de Gimnasia, la dirigencia de Colón acudió a la Asociación del Fútbol Argentino a protestar por el descenso con un manotazo de ahogado que, después de varios días, termina confirmándose en vano. Los justificativos de Colón para pedir la nulidad del descenso se basaban en los cambios de reglamentos que hubo a mitad de torneo, donde los dirigentes resolvieron quitar uno de los descensos que estaban estipulados desde un primer momento. Según el sitio Doble Amarilla, el Sabalero argumentaba que el cambio debió ser aprobado en Comité Ejecutivo y no en una Asamblea, además de expresar que no estaban presentes todos los clubes (Talleres se ausentó de aquella reunión). Nada de eso tuvo el peso suficiente para revertir lo que sucedió dentro de la cancha. Así las cosas, en la jornada de mañana se espera que se publique el dictamen del Tribunal, lo que permitirá que la Liga Profesional oficialice el fixture de la temporada 2024 y que la AFA diagrame cómo se jugará la Primera Nacional del año que viene.",

    "title": "Pentagon says UFO nearly crashed into commercial airliner above New York – as bombshell report is released",
    "text": "The Pentagon has released a new UFO report that revealed hundreds of documented incidents of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP). While there is no evidence to suggest that these UAPs (the government’s term for UFOs) are of extraterrestrial origin, some defy explanation, including a near-miss between a commercial airliner and a mysterious object off the coast of New York . The report comes as public interest in UAPs has skyrocketed, prompting the US government to work to provide some answers about these strange objects. It was released a day after House lawmakers called for greater government transparency during a hearing on UAPs. The Pentagon review detailed 757 cases of UAP encounters that were reported to U.S. authorities primarily between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024. That total includes 272 incidents that occurred before that period but were not reported. previously. Reporting witnesses included commercial and military pilots, as well as ground observers. Most of these incidents occurred in airspace, but 49 took place at estimated altitudes of at least 62 miles above the Earth’s surface, which is considered space. No injuries or accidents were reported in any of the incidents. But a commercial flight crew reported a near miss with a “cylindrical object” while flying over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York. That incident is still under investigation. The Pentagon has released a new UFO report that revealed hundreds of documented incidents of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP). In three other cases, military aircrews reported being followed or tailed by unidentified aircraft, but investigators found no evidence linking the activity to a foreign power. During the reporting period, 81 reports came from areas of US military operations. Witnesses who provided visual descriptions reported unidentified lights or round, spherical, or orb-shaped objects. Other reports included a witness reporting a “jellyfish” type UAP with flashing lights. The report states that trends in UAP morphologies remain consistent with historical patterns. “Unidentified lights and round, spherical, or orb-shaped objects made up the majority of cases in which reports provided distinct visual characteristics,” it reads. ‘Objects within the ‘other’ category include unique descriptions such as ‘green fireball,’ ‘a jellyfish with flashing (multicolored) lights,’ and a ‘silver rocket approximately six feet long.’ Investigators were able to explain nearly 300 of the incidents and, in many cases, the unknown objects were identified as balloons, birds, airplanes, drones or satellites. The report was released a day after House lawmakers called for greater government transparency during a hearing on UAPs. The report claims that Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite system is an increasingly common source of UAP reports, as people confuse satellite chains with UFOs. But hundreds of other cases remain unexplained. The report’s authors said this is often because there is not enough information to draw firm conclusions. “It is important to emphasize that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,” they wrote. During Wednesday’s hearing, lawmakers heard testimony from several experts who have studied the phenomenon, including two former military officers. The discussion included questions about extraterrestrial intelligence and military research using extraterrestrial technology, as well as concerns that foreign powers may be using secret aircraft to spy on U.S. military facilities. The government’s cybersecurity and innovation chair, Nancy Mace (RS.C.), took a philosophical or metaphysical direction in her final question: ‘How would you define non-human intelligence and non-human biological products?’ What are we really talking about?’ House oversight panelist Mike Gold, a NASA legal and policy specialist who now works in private aerospace, was the last to give his response, saying that we should reexamine the idea with modest assumptions. , but noted that an advanced visitor intelligence may not actually be biological. When asked what “non-biological intelligence” means, Gold responded: “Artificial intelligence, ML, machines.” Public interest in this issue was evident by the large volume of private citizen attendance at the hearing, DailyMail.com’s Matthew Phelan reported live from the event. Lawmakers said the many questions about UAPs show the need for the government to closely study the issue and share its findings with the American public. “There’s something out there,” said Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee. ‘The question is: Is it ours, is it someone else’s, or is it from another world?’",

    "text": "Forecast Centre The Weather Network Published on Dec. 13, 2024, 1:06 AM Drivers should continue to watch for rapidly changing road conditions as snow squalls continue Friday for parts of southern Ontario\nIt’s been a rough couple of days for Ontario’s snowbelts, where intense snow squalls prompted blizzard warnings for some communities.\nWhile those blizzard warnings have since expired, the lake-effect snow setup will shift farther north for the day Friday, bringing the continued threat for rapidly changing road conditions throughout portions of cottage country. Snow squall warnings remain in effect to end the week.\nMUST SEE: Canada hit with winter weather already, but will it stay for December?\nWe’ll see the snow squalls shift back north by Friday morning. Bursts of whiteout conditions will persist for most of the day as these snow squalls lock into place north of Barrie, affecting sections of Highway 400 and Highway 11.\n“Travel under the heaviest snow squalls is expected to be difficult to nearly impossible at times,” Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) said in its snow squall warning for the region. Be sure to check highway conditions before heading out.\nPeriods of heavy lake-effect snow will also affect Highway 1 around Sault Ste. Marie through the day Friday.\nFolks on the eastern shores of Georgian Bay, including Gravenhurst, could see another 20-40 cm of additional snowfall through the day Friday before the snow squalls finally wind down.\nContent continues below Conditions will improve heading into Saturday as the winds shift and a new airmass arrives across the region.\nBetter news is on the horizon. Looking ahead, changeable temperatures are likely for the rest of December, but more days will be mild than cold. However, we’re watching the potential for a more extended period of consistent cold weather for the first half of January.\nWATCH: Shovelling snow can lead to injury, here's how to do it properly Header image submitted by Jossi Storrs.\nStay with The Weather Network for all the latest on conditions across Ontario.",

    "text": "Tungathurthi : Mandula Samel's journey from a modest farmer to a distinguished politician is a testament to his dedication and resilience. A native of Mothkur mandal in Tungathurthi constituency of Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district, Samel belongs to Scheduled Caste and studied up to the Intermediate level. His grassroots background has provided him with a profound understanding of the challenges faced by ordinary citizens.Samel's political career gained momentum with his active involvement in the Telangana movement as a leader of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). His efforts played a crucial role in strengthening the movement, eventually leading to the formation of Telangana state. Recognising his contributions, the TRS government appointed him as the chairman of the Telangana State Warehousing Corporation, a position he utilised to advocate for the farmers' interests and improve warehousing facilities.Despite his significant contributions, Samel faced a setback when he was not given the opportunity to contest as an MLA from the TRS for the Tungathurthi constituency. Undeterred, he switched his allegiance to the Congress party in 2023. This strategic move paid off as Samel was given the chance to contest in the 2023 elections from Tungathurthi.Samel's electoral journey in 2023 was marked by a resounding victory. He defeated the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) candidate Gadari Kishore with a record majority of over 50,000 votes. This thumping victory underscored his popularity and the trust placed in him by the constituents of Tungathurthi.Since his election, Samel has focused on fulfilling the promises made during his campaign. He has been actively working on the development of his constituency in all aspects, with significant support from ministers Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and Uttam Kumar Reddy. His efforts have been directed towards improving infrastructure, ensuring better educational facilities, and enhancing agricultural support systems. Mandula Samel's political journey reflects his unwavering commitment and determination to bring about positive change in Tungathurthi constituency.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is urgently warning not to purchase or use supplements that [ contain tianeptine](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-neptunes-fix-or-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks), a substance that's been nicknamed \"gas station heroin.\" The products, sold under the brand name Neptune's Fix, can interact with other medications in a potentially lethal way, the federal health agency has repeatedly warned. The FDA, which first warned about Neptune's Fix in November, [ said this week it continues to receive reports ](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-neptunes-fix-or-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)of people suffering seizures, loss of consciousness and even death, after using these products. A voluntary recall has since been issued for all Neptune’s Fix Elixir, Neptune’s Fix Extra Strength Elixir and Neptune’s Fix Tablets. The products, like most items containing tianeptine, were sold online and at gas stations, vape or smoke shops, or other locations. What is tianeptine? Tianeptine is not approved in the U.S., although other countries have approved the drug to treat depression and anxiety. It has been illegally sold in the U.S. with claims to improve brain function and treat anxiety, depression, pain, opioid use disorder and other conditions. It got the nickname \"gas station heroin\" or \"gas station dope\" because of its availability at gas stations and because it mimics the effects of opioids when taken in high doses, [according to a 2023 review in \"Pain and Therapy.\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10444703/) The side effects of tianeptine abuse and withdrawal can mimic opioid toxicity, [a 2018 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6730a2.htm). [According to the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death), poison control center cases involving tianeptine exposure have increased nationwide, from 11 total between 2000 and 2013 to 151 cases in just 2020. Anyone who experiences a bad reaction to any tianeptine product should immediately seek medical help. You can call [Poison Help](https://poisonhelp.hrsa.gov/) at 1-800-222-1222 to connect to a local poison center.",
