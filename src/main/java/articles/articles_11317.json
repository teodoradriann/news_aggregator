    "title": "Toronto Braces for Potential Commute Chaos with Forecasted Heavy Snowfall on Friday",
    "text": "As the calendar marks the arrival of spring, Toronto and surrounding areas find themselves on the cusp of an unseasonal weather event. Environment Canada has issued a forecast predicting a significant snowfall for Toronto on Friday, potentially impacting the evening commute and catching many by surprise with its timing and intensity.\nAdvertisment Unseasonal Weather Ahead The forecast calls for five to 10 centimetres of snow to blanket Toronto and parts of southern Ontario, beginning in the morning and intensifying as the day progresses. This weather anomaly is particularly notable given the recent arrival of spring, challenging the expectations of residents ready for warmer weather. The federal weather agency highlights a low confidence in exact snowfall amounts but indicates that many areas may see the predicted range, with potential for even higher accumulations near Lake Ontario. As the system moves through, it is expected to taper off from west to east late Friday night, with the heaviest snowfall likely occurring after sunset.\nImpact on Commute and Precautionary Measures Advertisment With the bulk of the snowfall anticipated during the afternoon and evening hours, the timing could not be more inconvenient for those navigating the evening commute. Environment Canada has warned of reduced visibility in some areas, particularly where the snowfall is heavier. In response, winter weather travel advisories or snowfall warnings may be issued as the situation develops. Additionally, there is a risk of freezing rain near Lake Erie on Friday evening, adding another layer of complexity to the travel conditions. Commuters and residents are advised to stay informed and prepare for potentially hazardous road conditions.\nLooking Ahead Despite the disruption, the snow is expected to move out by Saturday morning, offering some relief to residents. The high late-March sun angle is likely to aid in quickly melting the snow, minimizing its impact over the weekend. However, this event serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of weather and the importance of staying prepared. As the city braces for the snowfall, the emphasis is on safety and caution, with officials and residents alike keeping a close eye on updates from Environment Canada.\nThis unexpected turn in weather challenges the readiness of the city's infrastructure and the adaptability of its residents. As Toronto gears up for a potentially messy Friday, the event underscores the broader impacts of climate change and the increasing unpredictability of weather patterns. While the snow may be short-lived, its timing and potential disruption serve as a conversation starter about preparedness and resilience in the face of unseasonal weather phenomena.",

    "text": "2 Dalmatians fight off pack of 4 coyotes to protect their dog walker BOSTON (WBZ) – Two Dalmatians had their instincts kick in when they and their dog walker were surrounded by coyotes Wednesday in Boston. Dog walker Josstin Lantadilla was out for a nighttime walk with two Dalmatians, Deanna and Tasha, near a Brighton apartment complex. “Deanna got very upset, and she looked up, jumped backward, and I said, ‘What’s wrong with her?’” Lantadilla said. Deanna’s barking alerted Lantadilla to look backward. Turns out, a pack of four coyotes was quietly lurking behind them. “So when I look at the back, I just saw them, I never realized there were four coyotes behind me,” he said. The coyotes were bold and lunged at the leashed Dalmatians. Lantadilla said Deanna bit one of the coyotes in the neck, which convinced the pack to run away. Jane Friedlander, the dogs’ owner, said she is not surprised that her dogs acted so bravely. She said this isn’t the first time her dogs have been targeted by coyotes. Lantadilla and the dogs were unharmed, and their owner is crediting their breed. “They’re meant to drive away coyotes, wolves, foxes, rabbits, anything that would bother a stable or horses,” Friedlander said. There’s no doubt in the dog walker’s mind that the two dogs were looking out for him that night. “Of course, they were meant for that,” he said. Copyright 2023 WBZ via CNN Newsource.
