    "text": "La nueva norma fue impulsada por segundo al mando del oficialista Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (Psuv) , el diputado Diosdado Cabello, desde inicios del 2023, y su discusión se reactivó en medio de la disputa electoral.\nEl presidente del Parlamento, Jorge Rodríguez, dijo que la aprobación de la normativa fue por unanimidad .\nEl oficialismo ha dicho que presentaba esa ley porque algunas ONG operaban con fines políticos y reciben financiamiento de gobiernos distintos al de Venezuela.\nLa norma de 39 artículos contempla que los grupos deben inscribirse ante Servicio Autónomo de Registros y Notarías, como era antes de la nueva norma, pero ahora deberán declarar \"si su financiamiento es o será realizado, total o parcialmente , a través de personas naturales o jurídicas extranjeras\".\nEl texto no indica qué sucede si una ONG recibe financiamiento internacional, y las obliga a que notifiquen \"sobre el financiamiento o donaciones que serán recibidas a los fines de asegurar la licitud de los fondos\".\nLa norma advierte que se prohibirá la inscripción a las organizaciones que promuevan el \" promuevan el fascismo, la intolerancia o el odio por motivos raciales, étnico, religioso, político, sociales, ideológico, de género \".\nEl Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos, Volker Türk, había pedido el martes temprano que las autoridades no adoptaran \"estas u otras leyes que socaven el espacio cívico y democrático en el país\".\nLa aprobación se produce después que a fines de julio la autoridad electoral del país declarara al presidente Nicolás Maduro como ganador de las elecciones presidenciales, mientras la oposición atribuye el triunfo a su candidato, Edmundo González .\nTras las elecciones presidenciales, las ONG e instancias como la ONU han advertido de una ola represiva con cientos de detenidos, al menos 23 muertos , la cancelación de pasaportes a periodistas y activistas, el debate de leyes como la de las organizaciones sin fines de lucro, investigaciones judiciales contra opositores y el bloqueo temporal de redes como X.\n\" Al final lo que se quiere es reprimir a las ONG con este proyecto de ley que se une a la ola represiva luego del 28 de julio y que lo que busca es cerrar definitivamente el espacio cívico \", dijo el abogado Ali Daniels, codirector de Acceso a la Justicia, una asociación civil que monitorea el sistema legal.\nEl anuncio sobre el proyecto es preocupante \" por el discurso estigmatizador utilizado, según el cual se asocia la acción de las ONG y otras organizaciones con servir de 'fachada para el terrorismo'; así como la difusión de 'expresiones de odio social y ideas fascistas '\", dijo esta semana Gina Romero, Relatora Especial de la ONU sobre los Derechos a la Libertad de Reunión Pacífica y de Asociación en su cuenta de X.\nEn Venezuela funcionan más de medio millar de fundaciones y grupos no gubernamentales que se dedican a temas desde atención de presos , monitoreo de la situación de violencia, revisión de casos de ejecuciones extrajudiciales, libertad de expresión e indicadores económicos y sociales, entre otros.\nEl Parlamento también trabaja un proyecto de ley llamado antifascismo, que castigaría con hasta 12 años de prisión a cualquiera que promueva la violencia en actos políticos. El gobierno ha clasificado las protestas post electorales como \"actividades fascistas\" .",
