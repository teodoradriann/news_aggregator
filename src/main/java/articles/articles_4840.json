    "title": "Colorado Issues Statement That Trump Will Remain on Ballot, Dem Sec. of State Has a Meltdown",
    "text": "As we reported earlier, the Colorado GOP has now filed an appeal to the United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) of the Colorado Supreme Court decision that booted former President Donald Trump off the ballot under the 14th Amendment, claiming he'd committed insurrection.\nAdvertisement See also :\nTrump Ballot Ban: Colorado GOP Appeals to US Supreme Court\nColorado Decision's Concerning Take Turns Speech on Its Head and Could Lead to Chaos\nThe Colorado Supreme Court said in its opinion it was putting a stay on the decision, which would remain in place if there was an appeal to SCOTUS.\nBut we stay our ruling until January 4, 2024 (the day before the Secretary’s deadline to certify the content of the presidential primary ballot). If review is sought in the Supreme Court before the stay expires, it shall remain in place, and the Secretary will continue to be required to include President Trump’s name on the 2024 presidential primary ballot until the receipt of any order or mandate from the Supreme Court.\nThe Trump team has also said that it plans to appeal.\nSo, while the left was celebrating the decision, the final decision is going to be up to the Supreme Court, and Trump was going to remain on the primary ballot, because the appeal was a foregone conclusion.\nSome are reporting this as putting Trump \"back\" on the ballot, but technically he was never off it, given the stay.\nNow that there is an appeal, the Colorado Secretary of State issued a statemen t that Trump would remain on the ballot, much to the chagrin of people on the left.\nAdvertisement Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced that Trump will for the time being remain on the ballot, which goes to print on January 5 – unless the Supreme Court affirms the lower court's ruling or otherwise declines to take on the appeal.\nGriswold was required to comply with the Colorado Supreme Court decision; that's why she issued the statement that she did.\nBut the Democrat was not at all happy with having to do so, as her post on X made clear. It sounds like she is having a meltdown that her hands are now effectively tied.\nDonald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court got it right. This decision is now being appealed. I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.\n— Jena Griswold (@JenaGriswold) December 28, 2023 Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court got it right. This decision is now being appealed. I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.\nTalk about throwing a small fit there. Sounds like someone doesn't like the fact that she has to act in accordance with the stay. But it's the Colorado Supreme Court that also ordered the stay, so I guess by her logic, that's right, too. Trump was not convicted of insurrection, because he was never charged with it. Plus, in order to be charged with it, you have to have an insurrection. A riot and an insurrection are not the same thing. Nor was Trump accorded proper due process by Colorado in its decision, as one of its own justices noted in his dissent.\nAdvertisement Dissent in Colorado Case on Trump Lays Out Roadmap for SCOTUS to Overturn Decision\nSo now, the SCOTUS can decide not to take it up or take the appeal. It seems likely they will take it up, given varying decisions on the matter in different courts and the interpretation of the 14th Amendment needing to be settled. But everything stays in place until then.",

    "title": "Best Practices for Storing Flammable Liquids and Substances",
    "text": "The golden rule in any laboratory is: Safety First! In that vein, therefore, if your lab uses combustible or flammable substances, then – in line with the safety principle – the right place is in a secure cabinet. Whether it’s a\nused flammable cabinet, or whether it’s brand new, the following liquids belong safely in a secure flammable cabinet: Benzine, Methanol, Ether, Acetone, Petroleum. It’s important to note that the list might also include other similar chemicals and materials.\nRemove all Doubts First\nIf in doubt, it’s always advisable to consult the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines on flammable and combustible liquids. Of particular interest, for laboratory administrators and lab safety staff, is OSHA Standard 1910, related to Flammable liquids, and 1926.152(d), which addresses Fire control for flammable liquid storage.\nThese guidelines will help you determine how best to protect your laboratory, its staff, and your equipment, in the event of a fire. Use them in concert with information we’ll share below, about new or used lab furniture you might find at\nlaboratory sales, online, or in-stores.\nShopping for Used Lab Furniture: Best Practices\nWhen looking for used cabinets to store combustible or flammable materials for a laboratory, it’s essential to prioritize safety and compliance. Here are three best practices to follow:\n– Understand and Adhere to Regulations\nFamiliarize yourself with local, state, and national regulations regarding the storage of flammable materials in laboratories. Different regions may have specific requirements for cabinet design, construction, and labeling.\nEnsure that the\nused flammable cabinet you are considering meets or exceeds the relevant safety standards, such as OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) or NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) guidelines.\n– Inspect and Assess the Condition\nThoroughly inspect the used flammable cabinet for any signs of damage, corrosion, or wear. Pay close attention to the integrity of the cabinet’s structure, including the walls, doors, hinges, and locking mechanisms.\nCheck for proper ventilation features, such as vents with flame arrestors, to facilitate the safe release of vapors. Ensure that all components, such as shelves and trays, are present and in good condition. Verify that the cabinet has the appropriate labeling and markings indicating its suitability for storing flammable materials. Refer to OSHA guidelines to ensure that the inspection process aligns with established safety protocols, promoting a secure laboratory environment.\n– Request Documentation and History\nWhen assessing items at\nlaboratory sales events, ask the seller for documentation related to the used flammable cabinet, such as the original purchase receipt, maintenance records, and any inspection certificates. This information can provide insights into the cabinet’s history and its maintenance record.\nInquire about the types of materials stored in the cabinet previously. If used with incompatible substances, it might have experienced corrosion or damage that could compromise its safety. If possible, obtain information on the cabinet’s age, as newer cabinets may have updated safety features and designs.\nSourcing Decisions Matter\nRemember, safety is of utmost importance when dealing with flammable materials. If there is any doubt about the condition or compliance of a used flammable cabinet, it may be safer to invest in a new one to ensure the protection of laboratory personnel and assets. At LEI Sales, we have a large inventory of new and used furniture for sale. If you can’t find what you need,\ncontact us and we’ll be happy to help!\n|Related Post|",

    "title": "Stephen A. Smith Accuses Kamala Harris of ‘Hiding’ At Pep Rallies And Avoiding Questions",
    "text": "Kamala Harris has been out and about since taking over for Joe Biden as the official Democratic presidential nominee. But Stephen A. Smith wants to know why she’s busy holding rallies and not answering reporters’ questions.\nThe popular sports media personality took to his YouTube show on Aug. 13 to seemingly piggyback off conservative criticism of Harris having yet to sit down for an interview with a reporter since launching her presidential campaign.\n“We’ve had one week, two weeks, three weeks, and one day since Joe Biden stepped aside. The only damn place we’ve seen Kamala Harris is at pep rallies,” he quipped. “What’s up? Somebody gotta say something, and it can’t just be the conservatives. Right is right.”\nSmith confirms that Harris has indeed “got my vote.” But he’s still echoing a question many conservatives have asked since the vice president stepped up to run for president in 2024. Is Harris purposely avoiding the hard-hitting questions from reporters?\n“I’m talking to my sister here. Come on now. You’re running for the presidency of The United States of America. You got my vote. You’re running for the presidency of the United States of America.”\n“What you hiding for? And I mean hiding in plain sight. Somebody gotta say it. Somebody gotta say it,” he added.\nWith the race nearing the one-month mark since Biden stepped down from the race on July 21 and let Harris take the lead, Smith thinks the VP has had more than enough time to adjust and make room for interviews.\n“Now, you can’t be running for the presidency of the United States. Not one single press conference. Not one single one-on-one sit-down interview where somebody gets to question you about the questions that we ask. That’s not fair. That’s not fair,” he explained.\nIt didn’t take too long for Smith’s take to catch the attention of conservatives, who used the clip to strengthen their argument against Harris.\n“I almost NEVER agree with Steven A Smith!” Republican pundit Steve Cortes tweeted on Wednesday. “But good for him for calling out Kamala’s refusal to face questions — and the complicit media running interference for her…”\nI almost NEVER agree with Steven A Smith!\nBut good for him for calling out Kamala’s refusal to face questions — and the complicit media running interference for her… pic.twitter.com/1ZPH1qFlHk\n— Steve Cortes (@CortesSteve) August 14, 2024 According to Smith, it’s within a conservative’s right to question Harris about not conducting any interviews now that she’s running for president. However, they can lay off the criticism regarding her ethnic background.\n“If you’re a conservative and you’re out there lambasting her for it, ridiculing her for it, trying to torment her for it or whatever, it is perfectly within your right to do so. All of you anti-conservatives out there, shut the hell up! That’s a valid point,” Smith said.\n“It ain’t valid to bring up her Blackness or Indian heritage and to try to point the finger at that nature. That’s nonsense. But to ask her about her record because she is attached to the Biden record is definitely apropos, especially when you were bragging about the record!”\nThe media has recently asked Harris’s campaign why she has yet to hold a press conference. According to a recent CNN appearance from one of her team members, a press conference is underway.\nCNN: \"Would it kill you guys to have a press conference?\"\nKAMALA SPOX: \"You saw the ways in which they went across the battleground states.\"\nCNN: \"A campaign rally is not a press conference. She's the Vice President. She can handle the questions.\"\nKAMALA SPOX: \"We're gonna be… pic.twitter.com/v4oDLz2r4P\n— Breaking911 (@Breaking911) August 14, 2024 RELATED CONTENT: It’s A Serious Matter!

    "text": "Memphis deputy AD Jeff Crane leaving for South Carolina | Source Jason Munz Memphis Commercial Appeal Memphis deputy athletic director Jeff Crane is leaving for a similar position at South Carolina , a source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Commercial Appeal on Thursday.\nThe source requested anonymity because an official announcement has not yet been made.\nCrane recently served as the Tigers' interim AD for almost two months as university president Bill Hardgrave conducted the search for a permanent AD.\nOn June 26, Hardgrave named former Virginia deputy AD Ed Scott as the eighth AD of Memphis. Crane, who came to Memphis from South Carolina in April 2019, was one of three finalists for the job, along with Scott and Tennessee deputy AD Ryan Alpert.\nCrane isn't the only member of the Tigers' athletic department to leave in recent weeks . Michael Schroeder (associate AD for integrated communications and marketing), Josh Moore (assistant AD for marketing and game-day presentation) and Emily Hagans (director of athletic stewardship engagement) each left Memphis to reunite with former Memphis AD Laird Veatch at Missouri earlier this month.\nSince arriving at Memphis, Crane has been instrumental in a number of key initiatives. Most notably, he was heavily involved in the ongoing Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium renovation project , as well as the department's work to secure its funding. Schroeder was also a member of the athletic department's working group for the planning of the $220 million renovations to the stadium.\nAs the sport administrator for football, Crane also had a hand in promoting Ryan Silverfield to head coach following Mike Norvell's departure for Florida State in 2019. Crane also served as the men's basketball sport administrator for the 2019-20 season.\nMEMPHIS ATHLETICS: New Memphis AD Ed Scott, eager to get going: 'We cannot do this alone'\nCrane wore multiple hats previous stint at South Carolina (where he spent 13 years), including executive associate athletics director, which he worked his way up to from director of marketing. He came to South Carolina from his alma mater, TCU, where he held the same title from July 2004 to July 2006.\nDuring Crane's time at South Carolina, he also spent three months in 2018 as interim AD at USC Upstate in Spartanburg, S.C. He led the search for both a permanent AD and a head men's basketball coach during that time.\nReach sports writer Jason Munz at jason.munz@commercialappeal.com or follow him @munzly on X, the social media app formerly known as Twitter.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "What if you get to know that the next big crypto explosion is already happening—right under your nose? Meme coins have rewritten the rules of investing, turning ordinary traders into millionaires overnight. With projects soaring thousands of percent in days, missing out isn’t an option. The real question is—are you in, or will you be watching from the sidelines while others cash in?\nAmong the hottest plays in this new cycle, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the spotlight with a game-changing presale offering a staggering 3650% ROI potential. Meanwhile, Notcoin (NOT) and Book of Meme (BOME) continue fueling the meme coin mania, cementing their place as powerhouse investments. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos under $1 with moonshot potential, this is your shot at life-changing gains!\n1. BTFD Coin (BTFD)—The Presale That’s Printing Future Crypto Millionaires\nHave you ever wished you could go back in time and buy Dogecoin at fractions of a cent? Or jump into SHIB before it exploded? Well, this might be your only second chance. BTFD Coin is setting the crypto world on fire with its presale, and the window to secure this golden ticket is closing fast!\nWhy BTFD is the Hottest Presale Right Now\nBTFD isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a fully loaded ecosystem, combining a P2E game (already launched), 90% APY staking rewards, and a roaring community of over 11,000 investors. Designed to capitalize on the legendary “Buy The Dip” mantra, BTFD is engineered for massive market cycles, offering traders a lucrative entry into the next meme coin explosion.\nHere’s where things get crazy: BTFD started at just $0.000004 and is now in Stage 14 at $0.00016. When the presale ends, it’s set to list at $0.0006. That’s an easy 3.75x gain before it even hits exchanges! But the real kicker? Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, which translates to an earth-shattering 3650% ROI.\nStaking and P2E Rewards—Printing Money for Holders\nBTFD Coin isn’t just about hype—it’s delivering real utility. The full version of its P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, allowing players to earn real crypto rewards while battling through adrenaline-pumping levels. Combine that with a staking program boasting a massive 90% APY, and you’re looking at a double-layered passive income machine.\nHow Much Can You Make with BTFD?\nLet’s talk numbers. If you invest $2,000 at the current presale price of $0.00016, you’ll bag 12.5 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, that $2,000 turns into $7,500.
