    "title": "How the next generation vertical farms are shaping the future of cultivated meat",
    "text": "They are a feast for the eyes: the vertical farms of the Berlin-based Lite & Fog. However, they are more than just good looking. The farms are an upgraded version of traditional vertical farms. By using a zero-gravity irrigation system, ultrasound and AI, the company is making sure plants are grown the best way possible, perfect for the development of cultivated meat. And there are many more applications. “Our machines will transform the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agricultural industries”, ceo and co-founder Martin Peter says. Why you need to know this: Advanced vertical farms are indispensable in a future where sustainable food is central. A brief glance at the [start-up’s website](https://www.liteandfog.com/), with a crisp picture of the high-tech system on the front page, was all it took to affirm that a visit would be rewarding. So I grabbed my recorder and went there to talk to Martin Peter, enjoying a cup of coffee in a large warehouse where the machines are set up. Peter’s journey began with a unique blend of studies in physics, philosophy, and art. “The idea came during my time in Israel, where water scarcity and technological challenges prompted me to explore the use of fog for more efficient plant growth.” He didn’t do it alone, though. “I was daunted by the prospect of spreadsheets and other paperwork involved in starting a business, so I asked my father to join me. Together, we embarked on this adventure.” Lite&Fog, founded in 2019, focuses on vertical farms that are, amongst others, needed for molecular farming. This type of farming is focused on growing genetically modified plants to produce proteins, medicines, or other valuable substances. The vertical farms of the start-up enable plants to thrive in sterile environments, devoid of traditional soil, by cultivating them on thin, fabric-supported structures and nourishing them through nutrient-enriched fog. Pesticides aren’t needed anymore. The company sells machinery rather than the plants themselves. “So we see ourselves as machine builders”, Peter explains. Zero-gravity irrigation What really sets Lite & Fog apart from traditional vertical farms is the use of fogponics: tiny droplets of water that are small enough to float and to enter the roots of the plants directly, Martin explains to me while we walk along the farms arranged in a large workshop. Those droplets are created by ultrasound and carry tiny amounts of nutrients to the root zone, requiring nothing but a small breezing wind to reach their target. [Graph 1](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/16548755/): (Predicted) vertical farming market worldwide from 2022 to 2032 (In billion euros). Source: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/487666/projection-vertical-farming-market-worldwide/) Making good use of AI Another notable feature is the integration of AI into the system. It monitors and assesses plant growth, providing precise data on development and health. “See it as a skilled gardener. For instance, by adjusting factors like light intensity, we can foresee how the plant will respond to this change.” Impressive results The utilization of these advanced technologies yields remarkable results. According to Peter, the smart farm produces 400 times greater crop yields and uses 95 percent less water compared to conventional farming, and 50 percent energy reduction compared to vertical farming. Cellular meat Currently, the start-up is establishing its presence in the market. With customers in the UK, Israel, and Qatar, their focus is on building a team, securing investors, and expanding their reach. Amongst others, the start-up partnered with Bright Biotech from the UK. This start-up’s technology harnesses valuable proteins in the chloroplasts of plants for cultivated meat companies. Peter explains: “Bright Biotech cultivates tobacco plants that are needed to produce meat from cells. However, they lack the means to achieve a wanted daily output of 20 tonnes. This is precisely where our expertise lies. With our machines, we ensure the most efficient cultivation of tobacco plants, optimizing their growth process to the fullest extent.” The benefits of cultivated meat Cellular agriculture involves using advanced biological methods to create products like proteins and fats for food without traditional farming. This innovative approach offers a [more sustainable food supply](https://www.moleculardevices.com/applications/food-and-beverage/cellular-agriculture) chain by significantly reducing emissions, land and water usage, and providing flexibility in manufacturing locations. According to Oxford University, cultivated meat could have up to 96% lower greenhouse gas emissions, 45% less energy consumption, 99% lower land use, and 96% lower water use than conventional meat, making it an environmentally friendly choice. Other applications But it doesn’t stop there, the smart farms can also prove highly beneficial for the medical industry. Think about life saving vaccines, antibodies and bioanalytics. “With our machines, you can, for instance, grow mRNA-producing plants that could be used for vaccines. We are looking for partnerships in this playfield as well.” In short: Lite & Fog enables innovation in numerous sectors. “So why are all the vertical farms mainly producing lettuce again?”, Peter laughs. A cultural shift Though, in the future, the company wants to contribute to making the food sector future-proof. Peter has his future with Lite & Fog crystal clear. “In ten years from now, we want to produce 50 farms a month, each capable of growing 20 tonnes of food per week.” That seems like a lot, but it is essential to provide enough food in the future. “Climate change, characterized by extreme weather conditions and prolonged droughts, presents significant hurdles for farmers. Additionally, soil contamination from fertilizers, diminishing space availability, and other factors contribute to the need for a reevaluation of agricultural practices. Ultimately, the primary challenge at hand revolves mainly around fostering a cultural shift”, Peter concludes. After the interview, Martin and I take one final stroll along the farms. A place like this is certainly not a punishment to work in, I think as I catch one last glimpse of the green plants before getting back into the car to get back home.",

    "title": "God Is the Murderer in This Creepy '70s Sci-Fi Horror Movie",
    "text": "Religion can be a beautiful thing that brings communities together — but it also has a history of being pretty violent. Particularly in popular texts like the Bible (you might have heard of it), people often gloss over the many shocking depictions of bloodshed and gore that this kind of text describes. It’s an aspect of religion that often goes ignored, which is exactly why legendary director Larry Cohen decided to bring it to the forefront in his 1976 horror classic, God Told Me To .\nFollowing a beleaguered NYPD cop who is facing a string of random murders where each perpetrator claims they were following the voice of God, the film quickly devolves from gritty drama into terrifying science fiction mayhem . Yet amidst all this violence is a poignant message about the brutality of religion and what it means to have “faith” in a human who claims to be anything but. Through the terrifying cult at the film’s center, Cohen describes the worst possibility of organized religion, using the plot's violence to show how people sometimes enact violence with their only excuse being that some higher power (or, more often, a cultish leader) approves. It’s a haunting message that, combined with the disturbing violence throughout, creates an interrogation of organized religion like viewers have never seen.\nAliens and Cops Collide in ‘God Told Me To’\nImage via New World Pictures Fans of Cohen know the director for his many mind-bending and laughable horror concepts, so they may have been confused to see the extremely grounded way God Told Me To begins. The movie starts as a police procedural rather than a fantastical horror film; Detective Nicholas ( Tony Lo Bianco ) is a devout Catholic and member of the NYPD who, after catching a mass murderer who said his murders were advised by God before jumping to his death, learns of countless other random crimes where the perpetrators said the same. His attempt to unravel this mystery leads him to a mind-controlled cult whose leader, the immensely creepy Bernard Phillips ( Richard Lynch ), reveals a shocking truth: he and Nicholas were ‘virgin births,’ the result of women being impregnated by a strange alien being. The movie excels in portraying these wild elements in a shockingly grounded fashion, using things like the brutality of the justice system or horrific scenes like a man self-decapitating in an elevator to grant this story bloody gravity. Yet all of this superficial terror pales in comparison to the film’s true message: the horrors people are capable of when they feel they can blame it on a higher power.\nRelated 'Heretic' Review: Hugh Grant Preaches Bad News About the Good Word in Religious Horror Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East are Grant's prey in the horror flick.\nPosts Religion is in no way an inherently bad thing; in fact, it’s undeniable that the practice of gathering based on faith has united communities for generations. Yet organized religion is constantly critiqued on how common it is for them to become for-profit, with people granting all of their faith to some leader rather than an actual higher power, with this leader’s “teachings” — often hateful lessons on discrimination — making the followers feel all of their bad behavior is justified. God Told Me To criticizes this toxicity that lives in so much of modern organized religion, with Phillip’s mind-controlled followers acting as an allegory for those who feel that their individual faith is not only reason enough to enact atrocities, but that one mortal should control their entire life. Even more, as Philip’s motivations are revealed to be world domination rather than actual worship , the film emphasizes that these leaders are still human, that they are not infallible and could be twisting others' faith for their own gain. As Cohen is one to do, this metaphor is told in the truly wildest way, but that doesn’t deny that the discomfort people may feel watching these horrors be committed in the name of God is only an exaggerated version of how people use religion to excuse their hatred today.\n‘God Told Me To’ Is Never a Good Excuse Close Despite Cohen’s attempts to communicate a real message about organized religion, God Told Me To’s stranger elements bog down what could have been an astute metaphor. The wild alien aspects take this out of what is a human issue — all while displaying some extremely transgressive thoughts on gender, sexuality, and race. And while no system is perfect, the film seems to label all religion as completely harmful, not attempting to have a complex conversation about the amount of good that organized faith does and instead focusing purely on the bad. Despite these issues in the narrative, though, the film does what few movies have the strength to in calling out the harmful religious institutions that persist to this day . It spotlights the irony of not only people refusing to recognize how violent their religion's origins are and the ridiculous tactic of feeling like personal faith can validate violent decisions . It’s a scathing critique as well as a chilling fusion of horror, police procedural, and science fiction elements, making God Told Me To stand out as one of the legendary director’s weirdest and best films ever.\nYour Rating close 10 stars 9 stars 8 stars 7 stars 6 stars 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star Rate Now 0 /10 Your comment has not been saved\nGod Told Me To R Crime Horror Mystery Science Fiction Release Date October 22, 1976 Runtime 91 minutes Director Larry Cohen Writers Larry Cohen Producers Roger Corman Cast See All\nTony Lo Bianco Peter J.

    "text": "As it is reporting the completion of the last piece of a water treatment system it is hoped will be able to return treated water from the Eagle Gold Mine site to the environment, the receiver in charge of the site has also acknowledged a fresh leak resulting in contamination exceeding “any previously reported results.”\nAccording to a March 5 notice from the Yukon government, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the receiver in charge, identified a leaking pipe on Feb. 17 and repaired it. The leak was not immediately reported as it was believed to be contained, according to the government, but further investigation found that an estimated 150 cubic metres (or 150,000 litres) of contaminated water escaped. The receiver was put in charge of the mine owned by Victoria Gold Corp. by a 2024 court order aimed to repair damage caused by a landslide that breached the mine’s heap leach facility where cyanide was used to extract gold.\nThe results of water testing conducted in Haggart Creek, which flows from the mine site, on the day the leak was discovered and the following day show values of cyanide, cobalt, copper and nitrite higher than any previously reported in past monitoring, per the government notice.\nTwo monitoring stations showed cyanide in excess of .1850 milligrams per litre of water on Feb. 17. Cobalt results on that day at those stations exceeded 40 micrograms per litre. Nitrite-Nitrogen levels spiked to .04 milligrams per litre. Mercury levels of .085 micrograms per litre were observed on Feb. 17 at one station but they had been higher the previous day and exceeded .1 micrograms per litre the week before the leak.\nLevels for all these contaminants have been routinely exceeding water-quality objectives for months, according to the government’s monitoring data\n“Subsequent water quality monitoring in the same area shows levels of cyanide and other contaminants returned to previous levels within two days. This suggests the cause to be an isolated incident. Despite the short period of elevated contamination, any level of cyanide above the British Columbia acute aquatic life guidelines can have harmful effects on fish,” the March 5 notice reads.\nAs the impacts of the Feb. 17 leak unfold, the receiver has announced completion of a settling pond, described as the final component of the water-treatment system for the mine site. According to the territorial government, initial water-quality tests show water treatment functioning as expected but further tests will be completed before water is discharged.\nContact Jim Elliot at jim.elliot@yukon-news.com",
