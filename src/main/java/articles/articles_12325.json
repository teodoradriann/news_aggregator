    "title": "12 Foods That Pretend to Be Healthy But Aren’t",
    "text": "Ready for a reality check? Some foods that seem like healthy choices are actually packed with hidden sugars, fats, and artificial ingredients. From sneaky snacks to so-called “diet” meals, these 12 foods might be sabotaging your efforts without you even knowing it.\nFruit Juices Image Credit: Shutterstock. I was one of the many people who believed the lie that fruit juice was healthy. Although it’s not harmful in small amounts, even natural fruit juice has a lot of sugar. One forum member stated, “It might be worth mentioning that the fruit juices you buy in supermarkets and fresh fruit juices are very different.”\nDried Fruits Image Credit: Shutterstock. Dried fruits may seem like a healthy snack, but they’re often packed with extra sugars and preservatives to improve flavor and shelf life. While they still have nutrients, the sugar content can outweigh the benefits, making them less healthy than their fresh counterparts.\nProtein Bars Image Credit: Shutterstock. A few brands of protein bars are healthy and made with nutritious ingredients. However, many are filled with chemicals and are highly processed, making them more like expensive candy bars than nutritious snacks.\nVeggie Straws Image Credit: Shutterstock. People act like veggie straws are much healthier than potato chips, but they’re usually just potatoes in another form. Veggie straw manufacturers typically use vegetable powder to dye their other colors.\nGranola Bars Image Credit: Shutterstock. There are many granola bars, but most are a step away from being candy bars due to the sugar content. And don’t even get me started on the Nature Valley granola bars, where you’ll get more crumbs on the floor than in your mouth!\nInstant Oatmeal Image Credit: Shutterstock. While I personally use instant oatmeal packets for convenience, I know they’re not a healthy choice compared to making oatmeal with fresh, plain oats. Instant oatmeal packets typically have some sugar or fake sugar, flavorings, and other additives.\nFake Meat Image Credit: Corrie Cooks. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, you may feel like you don’t have a choice other than eating fake meat. You may even be okay with the ingredients in them. However, a common misconception is that meatless alternatives are automatically healthy because they don’t have meat.\nZero Sugar or Diet Soda Image Credit: Shutterstock. One person mentioned that their coworker “guzzles liters of Coke Zero daily because she says it has zero sugar.” This is a common occurrence, and many people become dependent on zero-sugar sodas without considering the amount of fake sugar, chemicals, or caffeine they’re consuming.\nSalads Image Credit: Shutterstock. Although salads are a great way to get a few servings of vegetables, not all salads are equal. Simply attesting that a salad is healthy doesn’t work when covered in fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and heavy, creamy dressing, for example.\nVegetable Oils Image Credit: Shutterstock. An informative comment specified, “Their emergence on the market 100 years ago is the biggest change in the human diet since the introduction of agriculture. They are found in virtually all processed foods. They are obesogenic, inflammatory, associated with the cell death of neurons, raise blood pressure, etc.”\nFat-Free Foods Image Credit: Shutterstock. Many “fat-free” or “low-fat” alternative snacks and foods might have fewer calories or lower fat content, but they’re filled with other additives and chemicals. It would likely be better for most people to consume a smaller amount of a full-fat item than to focus on fat-free foods. You should speak with your doctor if you are concerned about your diet’s fat content.\nRice Cakes Image Credit: Shutterstock. Rice cakes are often marketed as a low-calorie snack, but they lack significant nutrients. They’re mostly made of refined carbs and can cause blood sugar spikes, leaving you feeling hungry soon after eating them. You’re better off choosing snacks with fiber and protein to keep you full longer.\nSource: Reddit .\n12 Discontinued Foods We’d Do Anything to Taste Again Image Credit: Shutterstock.

    "text": "□ 通讯员 魏良敏 李思宇\n近年来，东海县人民法院房山人民法庭立足农林业集群乡情，提出“农家法庭 法润乡村”服务理念，为辖区群众站好“护农法治岗”，努力把矛盾化解在基层、化解在萌芽状态，在全面服务乡村振兴中展现“小法庭”的“大担当”。\n农田改为鱼塘，\n法院依法护耕地稳农基\n永久基本农田经依法划定后，任何单位和个人不得擅自占用或改变其用途，这是我国耕地保护的一条红线。房山法庭通过依法裁判及判后延伸，坚决防止耕地“非农化”“非粮化”，努力让每一寸耕地都成为丰收的沃土。\n承包农田，开挖鱼塘，变身“塘主”，乍一听是条致富的“好路子”，实际上却可能“踩”上法律红线。房山法庭在受理的一起土地纠纷案件中，王某从同村村民手中承包土地并进行特色农田改造，后将涉案土地转租给张某，张某联合其他两人合伙经营，在原本种植农作物的土地上，开挖鱼塘进行水产养殖，改变土地用途。王某多次与张某协商，要求张某将鱼塘恢复为农田，张某不予理睬。经当地村镇多次组织调解无果，王某将张某诉至法庭。\n时值春耕时节，承办法官了解案情后，决定上门巡回审理，化解双方纠纷。房山法庭现场告知私挖鱼塘村民破坏基本农田是违法行为，要求其立即整改，恢复土地原貌。在法官的释法说理下，张某认识到自己错误，同意将土地恢复原状，双方握手言和。\n房山法庭坚持能动司法、绿色发展、系统保护、最严法治、协同共治理念，建立耕地纠纷多元化解机制，采取“属地化解”模式将案件分配至对应乡镇，聘请乡镇政府、司法所等工作人员担任调解专员，提供绿色通道就地解决土地纠纷。以司法助力“坚决遏制耕地‘非农化’、严格管控耕地‘非粮化’”，加强涉耕地非诉执行案件审查，审慎采取耕地查封等措施，助力政府依法收回耕地、盘活资源，与政府相关部门探索建立闭环“保护圈”。充分发挥司法的规则引领和价值导向功能，引导全社会不断提升农用地保护法治意识，为保护土地资源安全、粮食安全提供更加有力的司法服务和保障。\n一次有效调解，\n让案件从“两难”到“双赢”\n“吴法官，我们村土地流转遇到了问题，3600多亩土地面临抛荒，很棘手啊，请法庭帮帮我们。”2023年5月初，陆圩村党支部徐书记心急如焚地来到房山法庭。\n由于村集体的3600多亩土地发包给某农业公司，承包期限5年，到第3年，小麦正值收割之时，由于该公司经营不善，管理能力有限，同时在发包土地之时，双方未能准确测量承包面积亩数并交接，某农业公司要求解除土地承包经营合同，并明确表示即使不同意解除，该公司也不会再继续栽种夏季水稻和支付土地承包金。如果该公司不继续履行合同和交纳支付土地承包金，陆圩村委会就无力向老百姓支付流转土地租金，3600多亩土地也面临抛荒，损失巨大，影响恶劣。\n房山法庭立即开展诉前调解，与乡镇党委政府齐发力，向双方详细讲解农村土地承包法的相关规定，从“法理情”等多方面入手，做双方思想工作。最终，经过承办法官释法明理和耐心调解，双方逐渐放下芥蒂。某农业公司同意将小麦等农作物收割完，便于村委会安排下茬耕作。本来是两难的一起案件，如若不及时解决问题，农民和农业公司的利益都会损失惨重，在法庭调解下最终迎来转机，解了燃眉之急。\n土地是农业的根本，维护土地安全，保护土地正常运行，是关系农业发展、农民幸福的大事。房山法庭积极加强与村镇党委、人大代表、政协委员的沟通交流，促进与司法所、派出所、矛调中心等组织的对接，主动融入社会治理大格局，通过“巡回审判+多元解纷+科技赋能”等模式，将司法服务延伸到农家院落、田间地头，让群众切实感受到公平正义就在身边，为乡村振兴注入法治暖流。\n今年以来，房山法庭还在辖区内积极推进融合法庭，对接基层司法、行政及社会力量，构建预防、排查、化解链条式解纷体系，凝聚前端纠纷预防化解合力，推动更多苗头性纠纷、批量性纠纷化解在当地。\n深耕法治沃土，\n“一线体验”激活普法新维度\n“邀请我们参加这个庭审非常好，让大家知法懂法，才能更好解决问题，希望法官以后经常到田间地头给大家普法。”房山法庭积极组织辖区内村镇干部、种田大户、人民调解员、网格员等群体走进法庭，现场观摩一起典型的土地纠纷案件庭审。庭后，大家座谈交流，通过面对面的互动沟通，不仅能直接了解各村面临的同类纠纷，集思广益，提建议、想办法、解矛盾，还能提升与会人员的专业素养，促进土地流转的规范化、法治化。\n不仅要“请进来”，还要“走出去”。近日，房山法庭把“农家小法庭”搬到田间地头，通过巡回开庭的形式成功审结一起土地承包经营权纠纷案。村干部、人民调解员、群众等20余人现场旁听庭审。通过法官、人民调解员、村干部一个多小时的调解，被告同意支付欠付原告李某的土地承包费1.5万元，双方签署调解协议，该纠纷得以圆满化解。法官还结合本案例，用通俗易懂的语言向村民们讲解签订土地流转合同应注意的问题，对民法典中规定的土地承包经营权等法律法规及法律常识进行讲解。\n房山法庭还成立“助耕普法小分队”，组织法庭干警走访种植大户、家庭农场，针对农户农业生产过程中遇到的困难和法律需求，通过按需送法，为农民答疑解惑。同时，利用当地群众赶集节点，开展“法治赶大集”活动，通过多角度、全方位、深层次的普法活动，不仅帮助农民解决农业生产方面的法律问题，还通过普法教育提升其风险防范能力，从源头减少纠纷，维护农村社会稳定，为粮食安全提供司法保障，有效推动乡村法治化建设进程。",

    "title": "VIDEO: Cariboo deafblind woman fears loss of 'absolutely vital' services",
    "text": "About one year ago, Brenda Macalister of McLeese Lake was feeling isolated.\n“I had no opportunities to go out,” she said, explaining how, as a deafblind woman, she can’t go for walks and visit the community on her own.\nThings changed when Macalister joined the Williams Lake Fibre Artists Guild and was connected with an intervenor to help her communicate with the others.\n“It just gave me a real sense of purpose because I had something to work on and sort of a puzzle to figure out,” she said about weaving. She also gets to socialize with other group members and loves getting to know their interests and learning to communicate with them.\nAn intervenor is trained to work as the eyes and ears of a person who is Deafblind. Macalister and her intervenor, Pamela Goertz, communicate to each other through touch and American Sign Language (ASL).\n“When a person can't see, can't hear, you miss out on a lot of information that's just happening around you,” Macalister said, listing examples such as where people are situated in the room, what the room looks like and the colour of peoples’ clothing.\nHer time with the intervenor is limited to 8 hours a week, split on Wednesdays and Fridays. Along with the time they spend at the guild, Macalister and Goertz do errands, visit thrift stores or cafes and go to the farmers market when it’s on.\n“I just love being part of the Williams Lake community...it just feels like a rich time for me to feel like I'm on the same page as the rest of the world around me,” she said.\nIntervenor services are provided by the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB), supported by funding from the B.C. government received in 2022.\nThe program has been life-changing for Macalister, even boosting her mental health. She said access to an intervenor is “absolutely vital” for deafblind folks, but she’s worried about the future. Come March 2025, the three-years of funding provided by the province will run out, and no word has yet confirmed what will come next.\n“It's just beyond scary that I could go back to being isolated, totally dependent on my husband, like a little kid wanting information and wanting to express myself and having so little opportunity to do that,” Macalister said.\nMacalister was born deaf, and she struggled with night blindness as a child. As time went on her vision worsened, but she didn’t learn braille as a child because she didn’t realize she would need it. Upon meeting others like herself at a deafblind conference, she discovered she had Usher Syndrome and that she wasn’t alone.\n“I was completely gob smacked because there was a huge group of deaf blind folks – and there's a whole culture – and I thought, ‘oh, it's not just me’.”\nMacalister learned all about the deafblind community, and she's volunteered for and led organizations building awareness and advocating for better access to services for people who are deafblind.\n“I don't want people to perceive deafblind folks as people with a weakness. I want people to be aware that we are empowered individuals, and we can accomplish a lot together,” she said.\nIntervenor services are an essential part of this empowerment. Without them, Macalister said life becomes depressing as she is unable to read, watch TV or easily send messages to friends. She said it feels like being “alone in the dark” with nothing to occupy her mind.\nMacalister said the deafblind community has banded together to put pressure on the government for continued funding, which she said should be made permanent. She dreams of deafblind folks across the province having 24/7 access to intervenor services, similar to what she sees in Ontario.\n“We feel that it's just wrong that we have to continuously make this fight...because it's our human right to be part of the community, to be participating in something outside of just our own mind,” Macalister said. “It's really tiresome though, having to continually try and request funding and fight for our rights and just to have some basic access to life.”\nSheila Malcolmson, minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction in B.C., told Black Press she is aware of the importance of these services and is now working on a way forward.\n“I’m looking forward to having more to share soon,” she said.\nShannon Simpson, communications lead for deafblind community services (DBCS) with CNIB, said the organization’s leadership team has had positive conversations with the government.\n“While we do not have concrete details just yet, we are feeling optimistic about the future of DBCS in B.C.,” Simpson said.\nMembers of the guild where Macalister weaves said it’s been a delight to have Brenda join them, and that she’s taught them so much.\n“If for whatever reason she can't come here anymore, it's going to be a huge loss,” said Megan Tilitzky.\n“It would be a big hole in our group...she contributes so much,” Linda Purjue agreed.\nIn Canada, it is estimated that 466,000 people over the age of 15 have some degree of dual sensory loss. CNIB estimated there were about 1,033 deafblind people in B.C. in 2022.\nTo help break down barriers, visit CNIB’s advocacy page.",
