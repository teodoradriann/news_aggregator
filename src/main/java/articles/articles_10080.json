    "text": "My child’s prominent dad doesn’t want his name on birth certificate\nWhat you need to know:\n- The Births and Deaths Registration Act specifies that no person shall be entered in the register as the father of any child except either at the joint request of the father and mother, or upon the production of evidence that the two were married according to law or some recognised custom.\n- However, in a notable court case; Petition 484 of 2014, the courts declared Section 12 to be a gross violation of articles 27, 28 and 53 of the Constitution that ensure equality, freedom from discrimination, human dignity and safeguard the rights of children respectively.\nDear Vivian,\nI am a mother of a two-year-old child who was born out of wedlock. The child's birth certificate does not include the father’s name. This is because he said he didn’t wish to be included in any document involving the child. He is highly esteemed in society and his name would help my daughter get privileges and properties in future. Are there legal avenues available for me to include his name on the birth certificate without his consent?\nSusan Kibiro, Kiambu County\nDear Susan,\nEvery child has a right to a name and nationality and as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by their parents.\nIn Kenya, the registration of births is governed by the Births and Deaths Registration Act. This law states that the registration of a child's birth should include the particulars of both parents, if known. Section 12 of the Act, however, specifies that no person shall be entered in the register as the father of any child except either at the joint request of the father and mother, or upon the production of evidence that the father and mother were married according to law or in accordance with some recognised custom.\nIn your case, where the father explicitly requested not to be mentioned on the birth certificate, it creates a complex situation as the Act requires joint consent. The Children Act also plays a crucial role in matters concerning children. While it doesn't specifically address the inclusion of a father's name on a birth certificate without consent, the overarching principle of acting in the best interests of the child could be a guiding factor.\nThere was a significant development in this area that might be relevant to your case. In a notable court case; Petition 484 of 2014, the courts declared Section 12 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act to be a gross violation of articles 27, 28 and 53 of the Constitution that ensure equality, freedom from discrimination, human dignity and safeguard the rights of children respectively.\nThe court also ruled that all children born out of wedlock shall have the right and liberty to have the names of their fathers entered in the birth registers provided paternity is proved through a DNA test. This decision signifies a shift in the legal landscape, recognising the rights of children born out of wedlock to have their fathers' names included in the birth registers.\nAs a result, it would be advisable for you to consult with a family lawyer or child rights organisations to explore the possibility of relying on this court decision to include the father's name on your child's birth certificate without his explicit consent.\nWhile the legal framework initially presented challenges, recent court decisions have expanded the rights of children born out of wedlock. These legal developments have sought to prioritise the best interests of the child.\nVivian\nThe writer is an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and award-winning civil society lawyer (\n[[email protected]]https://nation.africa/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).",

    "text": "[В мире](http://forbes.kz/category/worldwide) Antimicrobial Resistance Represents a Serious Threat to Global Public Health Global Health Leaders Unite in Saudi Arabia to Combat The 'Silent Pandemic': Antimicrobial Resistance Claims Over 1 million Lives Annually Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (November 15, 2024) – In a key gathering that underscores the urgency of addressing one of humanity's most pressing health challenges, Saudi Arabia is hosting the Fourth High-Level Ministerial Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), bringing together global health leaders and experts from around the world to combat what experts are calling a 'silent pandemic.' The gravity of the situation is stark: antimicrobial resistance currently claims 1.14 million lives annually, with projections indicating potential casualties of up to 39 million by 2050 if immediate action isn't taken. Against this backdrop, Saudi Arabia is leading a crucial international dialogue aimed at strengthening the global response to this escalating crisis. \"AMR threatens people of all ages, impacting human, animal, and plant health, environment, and food security,\" stated Saudi Health Minister Fahad Al-Jalajel during the opening session. \"To successfully contain AMR, we must adopt a comprehensive One Health approach that systematically addresses the obstacles hindering progress.\" “Antimicrobial resistance represents a serious threat to global public health, and we look forward to working with anyone, anywhere to take on the challenge of eliminating AMR. We must build on current partnerships and forge new alliances to secure the health, safety, environment and economic development the world needs.” The Saudi Minister of Health, concluded The meeting marks a significant milestone in the global fight against AMR, with Saudi Arabia set to announce three groundbreaking initiatives. Dr. Abdullah Assiri, Assistant Deputy Minister for Preventive Health, revealed that these initiatives will address pressing AMR issues within a tangible timeframe, complete with monitoring and evaluation processes. The meeting's comprehensive approach addresses multiple sectors, as explained by Dr. Mohammed bin Khalid Al-Abd Al-Aali, Assistant Minister of Health: \"The One Health approach brings human health, agriculture, animal health, and environment all together. The leaders from the member states represent all these domains, sharing ideas and tackling this complex issue.\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasized the immediate nature of the threat: \"Antimicrobial resistance is not a risk for the future; it is here and now, making many antibiotics and other medicines on which we depend less effective, and making routine infections harder to treat, debilitating or deadly.\" The economic stakes are equally compelling. According to Dr. Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, effective action could save $99 billion annually in healthcare costs by 2025 and potentially expand the global economy by $990 billion by 2050. However, the challenges are substantial - developing a new antibiotic takes approximately 10 years and costs $1.2 billion, yet bacterial resistance can render these antibiotics ineffective in just two years. Environmental factors play a crucial role in the spread of AMR, as highlighted by UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen: \"The Jeddah Declaration calls for immediate action to protect the environment as part of our AMR response.\" She emphasized the need for reduced effluents and waste from pharmaceutical production, agrifood, healthcare facilities, and municipal systems. The gathering builds upon previous global initiatives, including the 2016 UN General Assembly Political Declaration on AMR and the recent Muscat Manifesto. With proper intervention, experts project the prevention of 92 million deaths by 2050 through improved healthcare and equitable access to antibiotics. As the conference continues, global leaders are working to forge a strengthened common roadmap with clear deliverables to counter the rise in drug resistance. The outcomes of this high-level meeting are expected to shape the international community's response to AMR for years to come, with Saudi Arabia playing a pivotal role in driving this crucial global health agenda forward. As the conference continues, global leaders are working to forge a strengthened common roadmap with clear deliverables to counter the rise in drug resistance. Saudi Arabia's leadership in hosting this crucial ministerial meeting demonstrates the Kingdom's growing influence in shaping global health policy and its commitment to addressing worldwide health challenges. Under Vision 2030, the Kingdom has consistently expanded its role in international healthcare initiatives, with the AMR conference in Jeddah marking another significant milestone in this journey. Through its strategic position bridging East and West, substantial healthcare infrastructure, and demonstrated commitment to global health security, Saudi Arabia is emerging as a key architect in the international fight against antimicrobial resistance.
