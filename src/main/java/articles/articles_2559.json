    "text": "OBE for Westminster Bridge attack survivor who was inspired to combat hate\nTravis Frain was hit by a car driven by Khalid Masood on Westminster Bridge in March 2017.\nMore support is needed to help victims of terror incidents, according to a survivor of the Westminster Bridge attack who has been made an OBE for his work to combat radicalism.\nTravis Frain was hit by a car driven by Khalid Masood on London’s Westminster Bridge in March 2017.\nMr Frain, 25, of Darwen, Lancashire – who says “not a day goes by when I do not think about it (the attack)” – has been honoured for services to counter-extremism and to victims of terrorism.\nHe said: “The simple fact is that the state can and should be doing more. I think in many ways this honour is a recognition of the countless late nights chipping away behind the scenes to try and lobby the Government for change.\n“My only hope is that with this honour I am able to continue to drive home that message to get changes that are needed.”\nMasood, a British-born convert to Islam, drove along a pavement on Westminster Bridge, killing four pedestrians, and then stabbed a police officer to death outside Parliament.\nThe attacker was shot dead at the scene.\nLives were torn apart by “82 seconds of high and terrible drama” in the attack, an inquest into the deaths was told.\nMr Frain told the PA news agency: “If I am going to think about the incident – and I will remember it for many, many years to come – I want to be able to look back with not just the negativity of what happened that day and the impact it had on me and my family.\n“I want to look back with a sense of pride and to know I have done everything in the years since then to make something positive out of something so negative, to try and help other people who have been affected by terrorism but also to try and prevent future attacks.”\nThis has included campaigning for the rights of terror victims to improved support from the state while also trying to prevent future attacks.\nMr Frain campaigned for a plaque to be installed on Westminster Bridge in memory of those affected, goes into schools and colleges to share his experience and has run educational workshops.\nHe created the Resilience in Unity Project in 2021, which records the testimonies of people affected by terror attacks in a bid to prevent people being radicalised.\nHe is also a member of the advisory boards of Counter Terrorism Policing and charities including the National Emergencies Trust.\nMr Frain was a politics and history student on a trip Whitehall when he was stuck by the car driven by Masood.\nMr Frain, who was closest to the road, took the brunt of the impact.\n“I went over the bonnet and hit the windshield. I was thrown into the air before landing back down on the concrete,” he said.\nHis left leg was fractured in two places and metal and glass from the car caused a deep laceration in his leg, missing an artery by about an inch.\nAll four fingers on his left hand were broken and he had a range of cuts, bruises and other minor injuries across his body.\nHe spent eight days in hospital and had two operations, and one of his visitors was the King, who was then the Prince of Wales.\nMr Frain said: “I spent about six months on crutches, followed by having to use a walking stick and then had about two years of physiotherapy.\n“The one thing I had a hell of a lot of during that period was literally time.\n“I just felt that what I had experienced had changed my mindset and made me realise there was a lot of work that needs to be done in this area to try and counter extremism and try to prevent these attacks from happening in the future.\n“I figured that if there was something, however small, I could do to contribute then I absolutely should do it once I was back in full working order.”\nMr Frain described himself as “immensely proud and humbled” by the OBE which he hopes may “shine a light” on the dedication of thousands of people around the country trying to counter violence and extremism.\nHe said: “At the end of the day we are all trying to prevent future terror attacks. There are a lot of people out there who may not have a story like mine but may be working behind the scenes and will never get recognition.\n“We had a lot of attacks in this country in 2017, the year I became a victim of terrorism.\n“We often hear that lessons will be learned. You would hope those lessons are being learned but I think it is still important that we bang the drum about why changes and improvement are necessary.\n“Since the pandemic young people are increasingly being exposed to extremist content, often online but also since coming out of the lockdowns.\n“I think it is really concerning, not just the speed but also the scale of the radicalisation.”",

    "text": "Fenerbahce 1-1 Manchester United: Red Devils pegged back again in frustrating draw as Jose Mourinho sent off Updated 24/10/2024 at 21:13 GMT Manchester United were unable to hold onto a lead once again as they were frustrated in a 1-1 draw at Fenerbahce in the UEFA Europa League. Christian Eriksen put the Premier League side ahead in the first half but they were pegged back after Youssef En-Nesyri's header early in the second half. Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands for his protestations over a refereeing decision. Jose Mourinho was shown a red card as his Fenerbahce side came from behind to earn a 1-1 draw against Manchester United in a high-octane UEFA Europa League clash in Istanbul. The former Red Devils boss was sent to the stands after reacting angrily to seeing his team denied what he felt should have been a second-half penalty for a trip on Bright Osayi-Samuel. United had weathered some early pressure to silence a typically hostile crowd on 15 minutes when Christian Eriksen pinged a brilliant first-time strike into the top corner from just inside the area. Marcus Rashford went close to adding a second with a lovely run and shot before Andre Onana produced an outstanding double save to keep out two close-range headers from Youssef En-Nesyri. However, the former Sevilla striker – who had scored twice when the La Liga side knocked United out of this competition back in 2023 - levelled within four minutes of the restart when he headed home an inviting left-wing cross. United controlled much of the second period but could not find the winner as they once again let a lead slip to make it three successive draws in this competition. Next up, The Red Devils visit West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. Talking Point - A solid point but losing a lead continues to be an Achilles Heel Erik ten Hag’s team selection raised a few eyebrows ahead of kick off – not least in the TNT Sports studio where former Red Devils stars Owen Hargreaves and Paul Scholes were a bit perplexed to see full back Noussair Mazraoui operating in a No.10 role. However, the new-look United were energetic and lively, countering dangerously and throwing their bodies on the line when Fenerbahce did turn the screw in an impressive first half showing. But a 1-0 interval lead is never comfortable for a Red Devils side that aren’t known for keeping teams out and it was perhaps unsurprising that an early lapse following the restart saw them fail to win after scoring first for the sixth time in their last eight European matches. A draw was not a disaster by any means here, but the familiar pattern will be frustration for United supporters, who will still have high hopes of going deep in this competition despite what feels like a long wait for a win - and the concerning current position of 21st in the UEFA Europa League standings . Player of the match Manuel Ugarte (Man United). The combative Uruguayan is still finding his feet following his move from PSG, but this was arguably his best display so far. The 23-year-old had a role in winning the ball and starting the move for Eriksen’s opener and made several important interceptions and tackles, including a goal-saving block in the first half.

The home team pull level as En-Nesyri finally finds a way past Onana with a firm header from Allan Saint-Maximin's delicious left-wing cross. 60’ – FENERBAHCE RED CARD!
