    "title": "Uber Launches ‘Business Black’ Rides For Busy Professionals On The Go",
    "text": "Uber’s newest ride option targets professionals and C-suite execs . The premium bookable black-car experience, named “Business Black,” aims to offer an “elevated ride for top-tier business travel.” The company announced the elite ride option on October 15. Vehicles such as the Mercedes G-Class or Rivian R1S will transport the tech company’s professional clientele. Perks of riding Business Black include highly-rated drivers, extended wait times for pick-ups, and an exclusive customer service support line. There will also be “simplified” billing, which will conveniently send receipts for expense reporting . Moreover, Uber will credit Uber Cash to the professional’s account if the driver can’t reach their rider promptly. “Corporate leaders are navigating demanding schedules when they travel for work. They’re often attending high-stakes meetings or connecting at conferences, operating on tight timelines and in unfamiliar cities. They can’t afford to worry about their transportation,” explained Josh Butler, head of Uber for Business. “Uber Business Black is designed to improve the business travel experience and provide much-needed peace of mind . The new ride type combines the luxury and comfort executives need to unwind between meetings with the flexibility and convenience of Uber to ensure a smoother, more reliable experience.” What Else Is There To Know About Uber’s Business Black Rides? According to Skift, Business Black is only available to employees of companies that subscribe to Uber for Business. Professionals can book the luxury rides on demand or in advance using Uber Reserve. The tech titan noted that bookings for a whole business trip itinerary can be done at one time. The customer support will be a 24/7 resource available up to 72 hours post a Business Black ride. Business Black joins several features and ride options Uber has that cater to executives at the top of the corporate ladder. In addition to the new service and Uber Reserve, the company offers Uber Business Comfort and a way for professionals to “delegate profiles.” The latter feature allows assistants to seamlessly book, adjust, and expense rides for their bosses via connected profiles.",

But, there’s a hitch – rain might mess up your plans. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) says there’ll be heavy rain in many states in the next 3-4 days.\nAccording to IMD’s weather bulletin, light rainfall is likely over Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh from December 31 to Jan 2, 2024.\nHimachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and East Rajasthan are also likely to witness rainfall during the next 2-3 days.\nThe IMD has predicted, light to moderate rainfall over south Tamil Nadu and Kerala from Dec 31 to Jan 3, 2024. Heavy rainfall is also likely over southern part of Tamil Nadu on Dec 31 and January 1, 2024.\nMeanwhile, the dense fog continued to persist over Northwestern India lowering the visibility in several parts of the region. Dense to very dense fog blankets covered the many most parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and some parts of Uttar Pradesh and isolated pockets over Jammu and Kashmir, Northwest Rajasthan and Northwest Madhya Pradesh.\nDense fog conditions are likely to persist in the above-mentioned regions, however, conditions may improve gradually from Dec 31, stated IMD.",

    "title": "Karthik calls Shubman Gill a ‘big question mark’ in Test team after SA failure | Cricket - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "The Indian team laid out an uninspiring performance in Centurion, suffering a devastating defeat by an innings and 32 runs against a markedly superior South Africa in the opening Test on Thursday. India were beset with relentless pace and caught off-guard with unpredictable bounce. Their batting performance, in itself, seemed a shadow of its recent past as visitors were bowled out for a paltry 131 in just 34.1 overs after conceding 164-run first innings lead. South Africa have now clinched an unassailable 1-0 lead in the two-match series, dashing India's hopes of securing a Test series victory in the Rainbow Nation for the first time in 31 years.The lone opportunity for resurgence now hinges on achieving a 1-1 draw, contingent upon India levelling the series in the upcoming New Year's Test in Cape Town. India were invited to bat first in Centurion; if not for KL Rahul's fighting 101, the side would have struggled to breach the 200-run mark in the first innings. But, while the batters endured a collective failure, Shubman Gill's struggles came under the significant spotlight as the young batter has failed to make an impression in the longest format so far.Also read: Sachin Tendulkar pin-points major cause for India's heavy loss vs South Africa in 1st Test: ‘From whatever I watched…’Since the arrival of Yashasvi Jaiswal to the Indian Test XI, Gill has shifted to no.3 in the order; however, the results haven't been too dissimilar. In 35 Test innings, Gill has 994 runs at a disappointing average of 31.06; his last 50+ score came in March earlier this year when he smashed 128 against Australia in Ahmedabad. Since then, in 7 innings, his highest score was an unbeaten 29 against the West Indies.India's veteran wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has insisted that Gill's position in Tests has now come under scanner, stating there will be pressure on him to make a mark in the final Test, which starts January 3. “Shubman Gill is the big question mark here. He has not lived up to the expectations that people have. I think even he would be aware that if you are going to average mid-30s or early-30s after having played 20 Tests, then you would consider yourself to be a bit lucky to be around. His place will definitely be under the scanner if he doesn't have a great Test match in the next one,” Karthik told Cricbuzz.Karthik also believed India are missing Sarfaraz Khan, who had been impressive in the domestic red-ball circuit for many years but is yet to make an appearance for the Test team.“The only middle-order name that we are missing out on is Sarfaraz Khan. I have no doubt that he will make it to the squad much sooner than he thinks right now. Other than that, you do not have any other names doing the round in the middle order right now. Rajat Patidar is a very, very strong name that I think they will be looking at very soon,” said the wicketkeeper-batter.",

    "text": "A new Xbox glitch is giving Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X users a free AAA anime game, however, the glitch only appears to work for those with an Xbox Game Pass subscription. Further, it remains to be seen if the implicated parties — Bandai Namco and Xbox — will honor those that take advantage of the glitch. History suggests the free game download will be revoked as that is typically what comes of glitches like this, however, in the past there have been examples that have been honored and the lucky Xbox users were able to keep their free game.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nTo grab the free Xbox game, first users will need to install specifically the Xbox One version of the game rather than the Xbox Series X version, and this needs to be done via the Free Play Days promotion. From here, Xbox users will need to launch the game on a console and then choose to upgrade the version of the game to the Xbox Series X|S version. Then exit the game and restart the console to verify the library. Upon doing all of this, Xbox users across Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X should find a free copy of Dragon Ball FighterZ in their libraries.\nAs Wario64 notes over on social media platform X, as well as the many comments on the post, this trick both works and is live at the moment of publishing. In other words, the glitch has yet to be closed, but it will likely be shortly once Xbox catches on. Whether it will remove the game from the libraries of those that exploited the glitch, remains to be seen.\nThose that don’t have Xbox Game Pass but want to take advantage of this deal can always sign up for a one month subscription, and only pay $1 rather than the normal $14.99 thanks to a special promotional price. This is a small price to pay considering the game itself is normally $59.99.\nAs for what has triggered this glitch, we don’t know, but it is not the first Free Play Days promotion game to suffer this glitch. In other words, it is a reoccurring problem for Xbox.\nRELATED: Xbox Game Pass Now Has Free Anime Movies\nAs for the game, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a 2018 release from storied fighting developer Arc System Works, which brought the fighting game to market with the help of Bandai Namco, who publishes all the Dragon Ball games. Upon release, the game garnered Metacritic scores ranging from 85 to 87, and as of May 2023, it has sold over 10 million copies, making it a substantial commercial success. It also notably won Best Fighting Game at The Game Awards that year.\nFor more Xbox coverage — including all of the latest Xbox Series X news, all of the latest Xbox Series X rumors and leaks, and all of the latest Xbox Series X deals — click here.",
