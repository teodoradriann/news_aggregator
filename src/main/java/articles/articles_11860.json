    "text": "Share Story × Share Story\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nEmail\nLinkedin\nWhatsapp\nMessenger Climate scientist Prof Nicholas Golledge’s book is a beautiful exploration of the concept of feedbacks, which impacts all life on Earth. Wellington-based climate scientist Nicholas Golledge has written a stunning book called Feedback: Uncovering the Hidden Connections Between Life and the Universe. In this excerpt, he takes us back 5,000 years to show the concept of feedbacks at work in neolithic society.\nFive thousand years ago, a unique and monumental episode in human cultural evolution began. Across the British Isles, from southern moorlands to the islands of the far north, Neolithic families worked together to design and engineer flat earthern platforms a hundred metres or more wide and to construct upon them circular arrangements of colossal standing stones. We will never know the words they used with each other, the language that gave them cohesion and commonality. And we might never know for certain what underlying force united them with such purpose and commitment. But what we do know is that, over the millennium that followed, coherent, organised, and socially well-connected groups built a thousand or more such structures, each adorning an upland or otherwise prominent seat in the landscape, using materials distantly quarried and deliberately imported, and employing labour from far and wide.\nWhy would they embark upon such a struggle? What reward could they have envisioned to justify the sacrifices they voluntarily made? For those who built them, these magnificent works of art had meaning and purpose, their slow and deliberate creation a bursting forth of a collective intelligence that had evolved gradually through the millennia before. In building stone circles these Neolithic groups proclaimed to the world that they valued their future and chose to shape it to their advantage. Because each structure brought order to the natural world, set in stone the cyclic changes that watermarked their daily lives and that repeated dependably from year to year, one generation to the next. Predicting the ebb and flow of seasonal changes, the circles these settlers constructed became the basis of a contract with their environment. With the help of majestic stone markers, they could each year be better prepared, more prosperous and prolific than the year gone by. The short-lived struggle of construction locked in long-lasting benefits and adaptations that eased their toil and enabled growth.\nThrough such monuments, these people harnessed the incredible power of feedbacks.\nThis period was one of purposeful and far-reaching change, a turning point that marked the establishment of a farming culture in these far corners of northwest Europe, a society that settled instead of roamed, cultivated instead of gathered. Technological changes had migrated slowly north from the developments of the earliest civilisations in the Middle East another 5,000 years before them. It was a time when regional climates were ameliorating, imperceptibly changing as the steepening tilt of Earth’s axis brought warmer summers to northern Europe, and the last vestiges of the great North American Laurentide ice sheet decayed and released its grip on the overturning circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean.\nIn northern Scotland, a remote peat bog archives the comparative dryness and milder temperatures of this climatic optimum, each millimetre or two of sediment recording the conditions of a single year. Eight thousand years of history, hidden in mud, buried beneath the surface of an unknown and isolated mire. And this mud can tell stories, can recount to us now what those early people could not. From bromine levels we know how rough were the seas, and from the clarity of liquid extractions we can reconstruct how the climate shifted from wet to dry. As Neolithic villagers cut, hauled, and thrust upward their rough-hewn slabs of Orkney sandstone, we know they did so in a place that was less battered by the wild Atlantic storms than it is today, where each successive year saw increasingly favourable weather, and one where the living was attractive enough to justify the perilous crossing from the Scottish mainland.\nWhether favourable climatic conditions were instrumental in the establishment and proliferation of henges and stone circles or whether their contemporaneity was purely coincidental, the investment of time, energy, and resources necessary for an undertaking as substantial as any of those whose lithic skeletons we still see today suggests an importance and purpose that has led many to infer spiritual motivations. We have no knowledge of the religious beliefs of these people, but the extant evidence attests to the considerable technological skill of this society.\nThe neolithic village of Skara Brae. Image from Wikipedia . The Neolithic village of Skara Brae, on the west coast of the Orkney mainland, is the most complete example in Europe. Occupied from 5,200 to 4,500 years ago, the 10 houses in this settlement had stone hearths, beds, and recessed “cupboards” in their walls. The houses incorporated basic toilets, each connected to a simple, common sewer system. Each house followed a similar layout with the same furnishings throughout, including stone storage boxes made watertight with clay, a dresser, and seats. “Low roads” connected the village to henges and stone circles across the island, and to Maeshowe, a chambered cairn and passage grave seven miles to the south-east of Skara Brae, most likely built around 4,800 years ago.\nHere again, the implemented technology was purposeful. A 35-metre wide and seven-metre-high earthen mound enshrouds a complex of stone-walled passages and chambers, whose constituent blocks weigh up to 30 tonnes. Together with the labor effort required for construction, estimated to have been in the range of 40,000 to 100,000 person-hours, the evidence indicates a considerable workforce and many months, if not years, of work. And this work most certainly must have been carefully planned, controlled, and coordinated, for the chief distinction of Maeshowe is that, at sunset each winter solstice, the sun’s rays are so perfectly aligned with the 11-metre-long, low-roofed and narrow stone-walled entrance passageway that only at this singular point in the rotation of the Earth around the sun is the central chamber completely illuminated, just briefly, before the sun slips once more beneath the horizon to mark the end of the solar year.\nFeedback: Uncovering the Hidden Connections Between Life and the Universe by Nicholas R.

    "text": "圖：聯儲局主席鮑威爾有信心通脹將會回落，年內將繼續減息，這有利金價表現。\n　　【大公報訊】受到金價首季強勁表現，和黃金ETF大舉淨流入的刺激，道富環球看好今年金價表現，認為基準情景的金價預測按市值調整為每盎司2800至3100美元，機會率為50%，同時更把樂觀情景範圍上調至每盎司3100至3400美元，並將此機會率提升至40%。而至於悲觀情景則調整為每盎司2500至2800美元，機會率為10%。\n　　報告指出，隨着全球經濟政策的不確定性升至2020年新冠疫情以來的最高水平，令人重新審視有關美國經濟例外論（即美國經濟和美元資產具備獨特優勢）的可信性，而這種宏觀環境，加上倫敦現貨金市場目前實金供應的緊張，以及ETF投資者的重新建倉、新興市場中央銀行不斷買入，因而令金價在今年屢創新高，在3月份全月上升了9%，在首季最後一個交易日更曾升破每盎司3100美元的水位。\n　　道富︰升勢不會一氣呵成\n　　另外，雖然聯儲局上調了對今年通脹的預測，反映出目前的通脹風險仍在，但由於聯儲局主席鮑威爾有信心通脹將會回落，年內將繼續減息，這對金價再升提供了良好的宏觀經濟環境。事實上，金價在每個減息周期都一直有跑贏大市的表現。\n　　道富相信，金價在未來6至9個月將會繼續向上破位，在升破3100美元後，便有潛力挑戰3300至3400美元，但升勢亦並非一氣呵成，投資者將會面對一段時期的整固，回調幅度將介乎5至7%之間，這亦經常出現於金價每個上升的周期中。",

Até a publicação desta reportagem, ninguém havia sido preso. Nas redes sociais, Thiago se identificava como \"repórter do povo\". Além de jornalista, ele era empresário e planejava disputar o cargo de prefeito nas eleições do próximo ano. A decisão de ingressar na política havia sido anunciada no mês passado. O atirador fugiu de bicicletaReprodução/Record Em nota, a Federação Nacional dos Jornalistas lamentou a morte e afirmou que vai acompanhar o caso para saber se o assassinato tem relação com a atividade profissional da vítima. A Rede Sustentabilidade, partido ao qual Thiago havia se filiado, disse que não se pode descartar a possibilidade de que o pré-candidato tenha sido executado por causa de disputas políticas, pois ele se esforçava para denunciar casos de corrupção no município.",

    "text": "Grocery supplier costs also up Food prices in New Zealand rose by 0.6% in the 12 months to July, according to data released by Stats NZ. This follows a 0.3% decrease in the year to June 2024, showing a slight upward trend driven largely by the rising cost of restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food, which saw a 3.7% increase over the year. However, some food categories saw price reductions, with fruit and vegetables experiencing an 8.5% decline, and meat, poultry, and fish prices down by 1.1%. The drop in fruit and vegetable prices was particularly notable, with cheaper kumara, lettuce, and potatoes contributing to the decline, Stats NZ reported. Monthly food prices rise On a monthly basis, food prices increased by 0.4% in July 2024, following a larger 1% rise in June. The main driver of the monthly increase was the 4.5% rise in fruit and vegetable prices, with seasonal produce such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples contributing to the price hike. “Price increases were seen from typical seasonal produce,” said James Mitchell (pictured above left), Stats NZ’s consumer prices manager.
