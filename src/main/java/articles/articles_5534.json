    "title": "Phd Students May Soon Have to Be Japanese to Get Living Expense Grants, as Education Ministry Mulls Rule Change - The Japan News",
    "text": "The education ministry is considering limiting living expense grants for outstanding PhD students to Japanese nationals. At present, about 30% of recipients are Chinese international students. The grant program was originally aimed at Japanese students, and the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry is looking at realigning the program with its original purpose. The ministry presented a plan to revise the program to a meeting of experts on Thursday, and hopes to act on it as early as fiscal 2026. The program, officially called Support for Pioneering Research Initiated by the Next Generation (SPRING), was launched by the ministry in fiscal 2021 and provides up to ¥2.9 million a year per student to cover living costs and research funding for their doctoral studies, with no nationality restrictions. Last fiscal year, 4,125 of the 10,564 recipients were international students, and Chinese nationals made up the largest group at 2,904 students. That led to questions at the Diet. Under the proposed revision, international students will not be eligible for the living expense grants, which can total as much as ¥2.4 million. However, they will still be eligible for research grants, and the ministry will even introduce a new system to adjust funding based on the subject of their research and their performance. Students working full time will also become eligible for grants. The revision comes as the ministry tries to finalize a strategy for developing human resources, which includes support for PhD students, by the end of this summer.",

    "text": "SEATTLE — The Seattle Mariners have signed 32-year-old Mitch Garver to a two-year contract with a mutual option running through the 2026 season.\nThe deal was officially announced by General Manager Justin Hollander on Thursday.\nThe Mariners roster now holds 37 players out of a possible 40.\n“Mitch is a hitter we had targeted from the start of the offseason,” Mariners President of Baseball Operations Jerry Dipoto said. “He’s a proven winner who brings a strong combination of zone discipline, on-base skills, and power to the middle of our lineup, while also adding tough-to-find depth at key positions.”\nIn 2023, Garver hit 19 homers in just 87 games with a .270 batting average and .370 on-base percentage.\nThe 220-pound designated hitter has appeared in a total of 7 Major League seasons with both Minnesota and Texas in 450 career games.\nGarver was named an American League Silver Slugger in 2019 after ranking eighth in the Majors. He is also a World Series champion.\nHe was originally drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 2013 out of the University of New Mexico.\n ",

    "text": "Mercedes-Benz EQS Has More Range And A Nicer Face [Share] The [EQS](https://www.autoguide.com/manufacturer/mercedes-benz/2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-range-test-review-417-miles-in-comfort), perhaps rightfully so, caught a lot of flak for its overly round Chicago-Cloud-Gate shape and odd face. One of those things changes as of 2024, with Mercedes updating the EQS’ looks, specs, and features. The most noticeable change is certainly the new face, which features a more traditional Mercedes emblem on the hood and “fins” across the grille that previously held a load of smaller Mercedes stars. The look is a little more traditional, but from a distance, it gives the EQS a more pronounced face, and we think it helps to assuage some of the criticisms levied at the car’s design when it debuted. The latest EQS sees a renewed focus on rear passenger comfort. Mercedes will offer a new Executive Interior package available on the car’s Pinnacle trim. It features a reclining rear passenger seat and allows the front passenger seat to fold forward for more legroom. Other changes include chrome accenting on the rear b-pillar climate vents and new contrast stitching and leather piping for the rear pillows, because those weren’t bougie enough already. There are more meaningful updates, too. Battery pack size rises from 108.4-kWh to 118.0 kWh. Given that, range increases as well. Mercedes claims an 11% increase in range, or around 50 miles. It’s worth noting these figures could differ slightly, as Mercedes’ figures used the European WLTP cycle to determine the new numbers. We’ll have to see if the EPA’s figures differ in any way. Finally, the automaker updated the EQS’ regenerative braking software to eke out just a little more range. Become an AutoGuide insider.

    "title": "My Grievance on NE4 to PMO gets addressed - Team-BHP",
    "text": "I have been a regular user of NE4 (Delhi Vadodra/Mumbai) Expressway and shuttle almost every month between Noida and Jaipur. I have seen its evolution in the past two years from a desolated empty stretch of road to a bustling and busy highway with a marked increase in heavy vehicle traffic. With time, changes both good and bad have started making their presence felt. On the good side, there is marked increase in the facilities and good eating joints and you really get the experience of a US highway with starbucks and drive through Macdonald outlets along with huge petrol pumps with at least 15 dispensers. World class washroom facilities managed by BVG group are a pleasing sight. Today, you do not have to think twice before taking the road. This is in marked contrast to two years back when there was nothing and the washrooms were two room shacks with 3 urinals and 2 seats. More buses have started plying and in general you do not feel alone. On the bad side, the increase in heavy traffic has led to the usual side effects of trucks hogging the right lanes, oversized trucks with animal fodder packed to the brim driving at slow speeds in the right lanes, trucks occupying three rows sometimes while they jostle with each other during overtaking. Also, lot of illegal dhabas have sprouted near the expressway and you can see queues of 8-10 trucks parked on the expressway while they have their refreshments. There are dedicated stops, the size of 5 football stadiums but the truckers out of their habit stop at these illegal ones. Today these situations are in pockets and manageable. My worry is that if the situation is not addressed, it many become larger and more difficult to manage in future. Once the trucks are used to a specific illegal dhaba and there is money in circulation, many things can be greased. I complained to NHAI twice on their helpline number but nothing happened. The bureaucratic response is we have asked authorities to do this and that. So, I thought to escalate and write grievance to PMO. I was amazed that it got addressed within 3 days including the response from NHAI and their consultants. Although the response is quite bland and tasteless and shows not commitment to action with timelines, at least some effort has been made and something has got into the system. Maybe later my grievance is lucky to picked up during audit and then taken further for deeper scrutiny. My experience with NHAI and then further escalation is that road safety is a policy and governance issue. We still lack the framework and policy and procedure to implement preventive measures with the right intent and commitment. My sincere wish is to have one hour session with Mr. Gadkari to discuss things in detail so that in next 5 years, we eliminate preventable accidents. My only fear is that if steps are not taken while things are manageable, NE4 may become just like old Delhi Jaipur highway where you have all sorts of hazards, risks and issues which are completely not in line even with NHAI manuals, procedures and rules. And if that happens, accidents are inevitable and respected members will start discussion threads lamenting and whining about state of affairs. So, if you find things not in order, it is good to discuss on forums but better to raise your complaint. If there is sufficient push, who knows things will move. If there are 20 complaints on road quality, someone has to notice. Here is the response to my grievance letter: Last edited by Rehaan : 12th July 2024 at 09:44 .

These heavy vehicles do this on non-access controlled highways because its tough for them to decelerate, change lane, accelerate and return to lane quickly when they face slow moving traffic like tractors, auto-rickshaws and two wheelers. Atleast on Hyderabad ORR, I don’t see truckers ever using right two lanes. There is clear markings everywhere to use left two lanes for trucks. The speed limit is also less (80 kmph) for left two lanes compared to 120 kmph on right two lanes. I think proper signage will easily solve this issue. Regarding stopping on the expressway, only heavy fines will deter the truckers. Else, they will stop wherever the food is economical and gives them that rustic & authentic vibes.

    "text": "[United Kingdom](../) Government pledges £22bn for carbon capture and storage technology in net zero drive The government has pledged nearly £22bn to fund projects that capture greenhouse gases from polluting plants and store them underground, as it races to reach strict climate targets. The plans are designed to generate private investment and jobs in Merseyside and Teesside, two industry-heavy areas that will be home to the new “carbon capture clusters”. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the move was “reigniting our industrial heartlands by investing in the industry of the future”, though there are questions about how best to use this expensive technology. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) has been developed to combat climate change. It captures the planet-warming carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels or from heavy industry, and puts it to use or stores it underground. It is expensive and difficult, but the UK’s climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), and United Nations scientists say it is essential to get the world to net zero, which the UK is targeting for 2050. Net zero means cutting emissions as much as possible and offsetting or capturing the stubborn remaining ones. Today the government has committed up to £21.7bn over 25 years, to be given in subsidies to sites in the Teesside and Merseyside “clusters” – from 2028. [Analysis: After warning of tightened purse strings, the public may well be perplexed by Reeves](//news.sky.com/story/after-warning-of-tightened-purse-strings-the-public-may-well-be-perplexed-by-reeves-13227383) It will be split between three projects, which are capturing carbon dioxide released either from making hydrogen, generating gas power or burning waste to create energy from 2028. The gas – up to 8.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions – will be locked away in empty gas fields in the Liverpool Bay and the North Sea. The government hopes it will attract £8bn in private investment, create 4,000 direct jobs and support a further 50,000. The cash will pay for fewer projects than hoped – the last government suggested a £20bn pot of money for similar projects – but the new administration says those plans weren’t properly costed, and the funding hadn’t been allocated. The funding is to come from a mixture of Treasury money and energy bills, but the government has been coy about the split so far. Questions on this might cause a headache for Labour, which has been complaining about an inherited £22bn budget black hole. Sir Keir said the announcement will “give industry the certainty it needs” and “help deliver jobs, kickstart growth, and repair this country once and for all”. Will it help jobs and business? It hopes to fund the first large scale hydrogen production plant in the UK, and help the oil and gas sector and its transferable skills move over to green industries. It has been welcomed by industry and the unions, coming just a week after job losses from [the closures of Port Talbot Steelworks and Ratcliffe coal power station](//news.sky.com/story/how-the-end-of-coal-in-the-uk-and-closure-of-port-talbot-steelworks-are-related-13225486). GMB general secretary Gary Smith said the news “shows what levelling up can really mean: good, well paid jobs reinvigorating communities”. Does carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) work? CCUS has made slow progress: promised for decades but barely scaled, with just 45 commercial sites globally. However, it began to pick up in the last few years, with 700 plants now in some stage of development around the world. The world’s first CCUS plant has stored CO2 under Norway’s waters since 1996, though elsewhere a few concerns linger about whether some projects leak gas. James Richardson, acting chief executive of the CCC, said: “We can’t hit the country’s targets without CCUS, so this commitment to it is very reassuring”. How should CCUS be used? Some believe expensive CCUS should be preserved for areas like cement or lime-production, that are very hard to clean up in any other way, rather than for sectors for which there are greener alternatives. Greenpeace UK’s Doug Parr warned of a “risk of locking ourselves into second-rate solutions”. The government hopes this funding for the three sites that are ready to go will lay the foundations for further CCUS projects.
