    "text": "Myfanwy Schostakowski was about six weeks pregnant when she went to her first pregnancy ultrasound at the end of 2022.\nSchostakowski, of Sydney's Eastern Suburbs, and her husband Benjamin had been trying for about two years to add to their family following the birth of son George in 2017.\nWhen tests confirmed she was pregnant, Schostakowski decided to have an ultrasound two weeks later after becoming convinced she was having twins, despite there being no family history of multiple births .\nBut as the sonographer waved the wand over her stomach, Schostakowski realised something was amiss.\nREAD MORE: 'Best friend's dad's name': The new baby name trend set to take off in 2025\nMyfanwy Schostakowski with her triplets soon after their birth. (Supplied) \"We were with the sonographer and she said, 'Is this natural or IVF?' and 'Do you have any other children?'\" Schostakowski recalled.\n\"Then she starts wiping all the gel off [my stomach] after only a couple of minutes and said, 'I am going to leave the room and grab my colleague.'\"\nFearing the worst, ﻿Schostakowski begged the sonographer for more information.\n\"I said, 'If there is no heartbeat, you have to tell me,' and she said 'No, there are three heartbeats, I think it's triplets.'\n\"Then I just remember my husband nearly fainted and said 'Triplets!' in this high-pitched voice.\"\nREAD MORE: Queen Elizabeth's final diary entry revealed\nThe ultrasound that showed Schostakowski was having triplets (Supplied) Schostakowski, who suffered from gestational diabetes during her previous pregnancy, said her mind raced with fears about her health and that of her unborn babies in the moments that followed.\nWithin hours of the ultrasound, she received a call from The Department of Maternal-Foetal Medicine (MFM) at the Royal Hospital for Women in Randwick.\nThe unit provides integrated multidisciplinary care to women experiencing a high-risk pregnancy.\n\"They rang and said, 'We know you found out today you are pregnant with triplets. How are you?'﻿\" Schostakowski said.\n\"I found out on a Friday and they just said, 'You need to take the weekend to process it and we will talk to you again on Monday.'\"\nREAD MORE: The one place Prince William says he can 'be himself'\nThe Sydney mum with husband Benjamin and son George shortly before she gave birth to triplets. (Supplied) By early in the new year, they had mapped out a plan to proceed with the pregnancy, which was deemed high-risk.\nN﻿atural spontaneous triplets occur one in every 10,000 pregnancies. About half will be born before 32 weeks, and require treatment in a Neonatal or Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU).\n\"All the scenarios were explained. It was all very transparent about the risks,\" Schostakowski said.\nThe pregnancy was closely monitored, with monthly, then fortnightly and finally weekly appointments, with scans sometimes taking 3½ hours.\n\"Everything was explained at every part of their development. How they were measuring, their weight,\" she said.\n\"It was very stressful. Mental health is such a big part of any pregnancy but with a high-order multiple birth, more so.\" ﻿\nSchostakowski weighed more than 100kg and her skin would itch and burn. (Supplied) Schostakowski's health was also closely monitored. Her gestational diabetes was eventually managed with insulin, as her weight ballooned by more than 30 kilograms.\n\"We were never aiming to get to 40 weeks. We were hoping to get to 30 weeks and the maximum was 35 weeks,\" she said.\nAs the weeks went by, and the delivery date drew closer, social workers warned Schostakowski about what to expect.\nNurses also buoyed her spirits when she felt like she couldn't go on.\nFinally, when ﻿Schostakowski was approaching 33 weeks, a decision was made to admit her to hospital to administer the steroids needed to strengthen the babies' lungs ahead of their delivery, which was planned for later that week.\nThe triplets soon after their birth in the Royal Hospital for Women, Randwick. (Supplied) When the day finally arrived, Schostakowski walked herself to the elevator and then the operating suite where an elective caesarean was scheduled to take place.\nInside, she found a team of about 30 people waiting to deliver and care for the triplets.\nShe was able to stay calm by \"thinking about all the team around me.\"\nThe top 10 names for boys and girls in the US revealed View Gallery The couple elected not to learn the sex of the babies, who were born within two minutes of each other on June 15, 2023, at 33 weeks and two days' gestation.\nFirst was Ophelia, then Violet, and finally Ivy. While the two eldest suffered respiratory distress and were immediately whisked away, Ivy, the smallest of the trio, was able to have a quick cuddle in her mother's arms.\nHours later﻿, Schostakowski was reunited with her daughters in the hospital's NICU, where they spent two days before being moved to the special care nursery.\nMyfanwy Schostakowski with her triplets. (Supplied) They went home, on the same day, five weeks later.\nSchostakowski is speaking about the care she and her daughters received to support The Royal Giving Day on Wednesday, November 13, to raise much-needed funds for The Royal Hospital for Women.\nAs the only dedicated women's hospital in NSW, it plays a critical role in the health and well-being of women and newborn babies, but relies heavily on community support to fund state-of-the-art equipment, research and programs.\nIn fact, 80 per cent of the specialised medical equipment in the hospital's Newborn Intensive Care Unit was funded by donations.\nThe triplets are now 16 months old. (Supplied) These include the lifesaving humidicribs and CPAP machines used by the triplets.\n\"My girls needed that and if they didn't have access to that, they wouldn't be the healthy children they are now,\" Schostakowski said.\nThe 12-hour telethon style event is organised by the Royal Hospital for Women Foundation and has raised more than $750,000 since it was first held in 2021.\nThis year is extra special as it marks the hospital's 30th anniversary.﻿ All donations made by the public on the day will be matched by corporate donors.\nNine's Alex Cullen will host the event, which will be attended by former Aussie tennis player Casey Dellacqua, past and present Matildas players Nicola Bolger, Leigh Wardell and Julie Murray, Sydney Swans chief executive Tom Harley and his wife Felicity, Sydney Swans players and former hurdler Jana Pittman, who is now a doctor at the hospital.\n\"If they didn't have access to [the NICU's specialised equipment], they wouldn't be the healthy children they are now.\" (Supplied) Foundation chief executive Elise Jennings said funds raised on day support the hospital's work.\n\"All donations – big or small – make a real difference to the lives of the women and newborns we care for here at the Royal,\" she said.\nMore than 4000 babies were born at the hospital in the past year, while 10,000 women used the hospital's services, which include everything from maternity to oncology.\nYou can support the hospital here .﻿\nFOLLOW US ON WHATSAPP HERE : Stay across all the latest in celebrity, lifestyle and opinion via our WhatsApp channel.

    "text": "A ESPN Brasil afastou seis jornalistas após a exibição de um programa especial sobre a atuação da Confederação Brasileira de Futebol (CBF), presidida por Ednaldo Rodrigues. A decisão ocorreu após o grupo discutir as denúncias feitas pela revista Piauí sobre o comportamento do presidente da CBF. O debate aconteceu no programa Linha de Passe , transmitido na segunda-feira (7).\nA informação foi inicialmente divulgada pelo portal Uol. Os jornalistas afastados, que incluem Gian Oddi, Paulo Calçade, Pedro Ivo Almeida, Victor Birner, William Tavares e o produtor do programa, Dimas Coppede, devem retornar às suas funções nesta quinta-feira (10).\nA principal razão para o afastamento foi a falta de informação antecipada sobre o conteúdo do programa, o que gerou desconforto entre os executivos da ESPN. Em consequência disso, a direção decidiu alterar a formação do Linha de Passe exibido na terça-feira, 8 de abril. Assim, o programa contou com a presença de André Pilhal, André Kfouri, Breiler Pires, Eugênio Leal e Leonardo Bertozzi.\nCBF nega interferência A CBF se manifestou e negou envolver-se na decisão da ESPN. Em nota, a entidade esclareceu que não pressionou a emissora para que tomasse tal medida. Além disso, a Confederação reiterou seu respeito pela liberdade de imprensa e destacou que não interfere na linha editorial dos veículos de comunicação.\n“Não procede. A CBF respeita a liberdade de imprensa com responsabilidade e não pede interferências de nenhum tipo na linha editorial de veículos de comunicação. Qualquer narrativa diferente desta é mentirosa e leviana”, afirmou a entidade.\nJornalista se posiciona O jornalista Gian Oddi também se pronunciou sobre o ocorrido. Em suas redes sociais, ele afirmou que seu retorno ao programa, previsto para quinta-feira, 10 de abril, só aconteceria porque ele tinha a certeza de que continuaria a ter liberdade para expressar suas opiniões, como sempre fez. Dessa forma, Oddi destacou que essa liberdade é fundamental para seu trabalho.\n“Fala, pessoal. Estou gravando para falar sobre a matéria que saiu hoje no UOL e foi replicada em vários outros lugares, a respeito do Linha de Passe da última segunda-feira, 7 de abril. Eu e meus colegas voltamos ao programa na quinta-feira. Sinceramente, se eu vou voltar é porque sei que continuaremos a falar do jeito que sempre falamos, com a liberdade que sempre tive nesses mais de 15 anos contratados pelo Trajano. Essa liberdade é fundamental para o nosso trabalho. Se isso não fosse possível, eu não voltaria. Nem a ESPN, talvez nem o jornalismo esportivo, faria sentido para mim”, disse Oddi.\nEle também comentou a razão do afastamento, explicando que a direção da ESPN alegou que um programa como o exibido exigia que a emissora estivesse preparada para as possíveis consequências.\n“Certos processos precisam ser seguidos, e alguns não foram, essa é a explicação que recebemos”, completou o jornalista.",

    "title": "Differences among hostages’ families complicate Netanyahu’s calculus - The Boston Globe",
    "text": "JERUSALEM — As Israel awaited a signal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators about whether Hamas’s military leaders were prepared to advance talks on a possible cease-fire and hostage release, differences among the families of the more than 100 captives remaining in the Gaza Strip were emerging.\nSome are pushing for a deal at all costs, while others are urging the government to fight on against Hamas until victory. For months, the families of the hostages have been a key — and largely united — voice in putting pressure on the Israeli government to prioritize efforts to secure their release. Now some are backing calls for a tougher stance toward Hamas, including blocking all aid to Gaza, even as the government is under international pressure to increase humanitarian assistance.\nAdvertisement\nThose differences have added to political fighting in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing threats from coalition partners and sparring with the opposition leader, who has offered him political cover for a hostage release.\nHamas’s exiled political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said this week that Hamas had received the outline of a deal, sketched out Sunday by US, Israeli, Egyptian, and Qatari officials at a high-level meeting in Paris. Officials have said the deal describes a phased process beginning with a pause in the fighting for several weeks, to allow for the return of a first group of about three dozen of the most vulnerable hostages, including women and any children left alive, as well as sick or wounded captives, in return for Palestinian prisoners. Further stages could extend the truce and include other categories of hostages, including soldiers.\nHamas leaders have demanded that any deal ultimately brings an end to the war in Gaza — a condition that Netanyahu has rejected. Netanyahu said he would not release “thousands” of Palestinian prisoners but has not publicly ruled out releasing prisoners of value to Hamas, including many convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis.\nAdvertisement\nAs some details of the framework have become public, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the leader of a far-right party that Netanyahu relies on to hold a majority in parliament, has publicly threatened to leave the coalition, warning that “an excessive deal equals dismantling the government.” Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right minister of finance, has declared that ending the war is not an option.\nIn public, at least, Netanyahu was taking a hard line that appeared to be aimed at reassuring far-right coalition partners. In a video statement released late Wednesday, Netanyahu emphasized that he would not accept a deal “at any price” and reiterated that Israel would not withdraw its forces from Gaza or release thousands of Palestinian prisoners.\n“We are constantly working to release our hostages and to achieve the other objectives of the war: Hamas’s destruction and to ensure that Gaza is not a threat to Israel,” he said. “We are working on all three of them together, and we will not concede any of them.”\nWith Netanyahu’s hold on power tenuous, the leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, offered this week to provide him with a political “safety net” for a hostage deal, either by voting for it from the opposition or by temporarily joining his government.\nBut the gesture was received with little enthusiasm by Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party. “Yair Lapid is pushing for an immediate end to the war, without a total victory,” the party said in a statement Wednesday. “We will not agree to that.”\nAdvertisement\nLapid has not called to stop the war and leave the Hamas leadership in Gaza in power, according to a person close to the opposition leader, but he has been critical of Netanyahu’s refusal to present a strategy for the day after the war in Gaza and a vision for the future of the enclave.\nIn an interview published in Thursday’s Maariv newspaper, Lapid said that Netanyahu was “no longer fit” to serve as prime minister and called for an alternative government without him, or for elections.\nThe pressure on Netanyahu has been rising as some relatives of captives in Gaza, alongside far-right politicians, have participated in protests at border crossings to try to block humanitarian assistance from entering the enclave.\nMany relatives of hostages and their supporters have called for releasing hostages to be a higher priority than any other war goal, though others have urged the government not to agree to any cease-fire or “a skewed deal.”\nSome Israeli military reservists and relatives of hostages have planned a multiday march beginning Sunday near the Gaza border and culminating in a demonstration four days later in Jerusalem. “We expect this war to continue until final victory,” organizers said in a statement.\nMore than 240 people were taken hostage during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, in which Israeli officials say 1,200 people were killed. During a seven-day pause in November, women and children were among more than 100 hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Google Classroom launched new analytics and student-engagement features for schools subscribing to Education Plus. Educators can now access an Analytics tab on any class page and view targeted alerts on student progress. These include notices like “3 students’ grades rose by over 25% since last month” or warnings when multiple assignments are late.\nOn the Classwork page, teachers will spot a count showing how many students haven’t opened attached Drive files. This tackles a common challenge: determining whether no submissions mean struggle or forgetfulness. With this signal, teachers can follow up individually or send class-wide reminders .\nAdmin rollouts follow a phased schedule. Student engagement metrics are active now. The Analytics tab appears on class pages by June?30, and the full set of alerts will reach all Education Plus domains by August?1 . However, access requires a Google Workspace for Education Plus license. Super admins automatically see analytics; they must grant access to other education leaders or staff .\nOther recent Google news –\nThe updates build on Classroom’s centralized dashboard, introduced in 2023. Instructors can now act faster. For example, if a student scores below 70% or a deadline looms and no one has begun an assignment, the system flags it. Teachers can intervene early. Insights appear based on performance issues or assignment timing .\nSuper admins and designated staff can temporarily access any class to view analytics or support teachers. This helps during substitute teaching or intervention .\nThese tools aim to reduce guesswork. Rather than relying on end-of-week grading, teachers can spot disengagement, unopened files, late submissions, and declining performance in real time. The rapid-release and scheduled-release rollout ensures districts see these features gradually. The Analytics tab reaches users by June?30, with full insights available by August?1.\nBy tightly integrating engagement tracking and alerts into Classroom, Google gives educators tools to respond quickly. This could improve outcomes and reduce last-minute catchups. The enhancements roll out over the summer to Google Workspace for Education Plus domains.\nYou may also be interested to read –",
