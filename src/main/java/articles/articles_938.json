Este, en septiembre 2022, fue impactado por la nave DART de la NASA, que consiguió desviar su órbita -una media hora-.\nTe puede interesar:\nGoogle lanza robots de IA con razonamiento más avanzado y funciones físicas\nDel tamaño de un automóvil, Hera fue lanzada al espacio en octubre de 2024 y, desde entonces, viaja rumbo al único asteroide cuya órbita ha sido modificada por la acción humana, un destino al que llegará en otoño de 2026 para escudriñar las secuelas de aquel impacto cinético.\nEl sobrevuelo por Marte es una de las maniobras necesarias para completar el viaje. Según datos previos de la ESA y a la espera de que los confirme mañana, la máxima aproximación de la nave a Marte se produjo a las 12:51 horas GMT y a su luna Deimos a las 12:07 horas GMT.\nSegún el director general de la Agencia Espacial Europea, Josef Aschbacher, por medio de una publicación en la red social X, la nave orquestó \"un sobrevuelo exitoso\", aprovechando la gravedad del planeta rojo para orientarla hacia los asteroides de destino, a la vez que probaba sus instrumentos.\nJust in:��SUCCESS!\n[@ESA_Hera]orchestrated a successful flyby of Mars, using the red planet’s gravity to swing it on course towards its destination asteroids, while also testing out its instruments.

    "title": "Does Yellow Mucus Mean You're Getting Better? Snot Colors Explained",
    "text": "Americans are weathering the worst flu season in years, as a number of other respiratory illnesses circulate too, such as COVID-19, RSV and the common cold.\nA telltale sign you’re getting sick is excess mucus, and if you’ve ever been desperate to stop coughing and sneezing, you’ve likely examined your mucus color, from yellow to green, for signs you may be healing.\n“We are in the midst of one of the most severe flu seasons in the past few decades, and it is important to maintain our health by following good hygienic practices and getting vaccinated,” Dr. Aaron Glatt , chair of the department of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York, tells TODAY.com.\nFlu activity tends to increase after the holidays, but this winter’s flu activity is unusually high for mid-February, experts say. Some schools are temporarily closing due to illnesses, and some hospitals are overwhelmed with patients.\nCOVID-19 activity is also high or very high in 30 states, according to wastewater data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, RSV rates are declining but are still higher than they were in early December.\nWhen you have a respiratory illness, excess mucus is an under-appreciated line of defense from your immune system. But can you really tell what kind of illness you have or where you are in your infection based on your mucus? Here’s a breakdown of what goes on inside our body when we’re sick and why mucus changes colors.\nWhat is mucus? Why does your body produce it? Mucus is the body’s natural moisturizer and provides a first line of defense against irritants from the outside environment.\nIt lubricates the lining of the nose when it gets too dry but also traps outside invaders, like germs and dust, because of how sticky it becomes.\n“Our bodies produce mucus as both a normal way to help maintain good health and to help one fight off infection,” Glatt states.\nNormal mucus often looks clear or white for most people, experts say.\nBut mucus changes color, depending on the individual’s environment, in response to various germs and more, he adds.\nWhat does yellow mucus mean? Yellow mucus means your body's immune system has been activated, which can change the color or consistency of your mucus, according to the Cleveland Clinic .\nInitially, during an infection, the mucus will be clear, but it usually changes to yellow within a few days. Many people believe that yellow or green mucus indicates a bacterial infection, but experts caution that color doesn’t correlate to a particular type of infection, as both viruses and bacteria can cause yellow mucus.\nYellow mucus could also be caused by non-infectious triggers, like allergies.\nDoes yellow mucus mean a cold is healing? In a typical viral respiratory infection, such as the common cold, mucus in the nose starts out as clear but gradually turns yellow or green as the infection progresses.\nSo essentially, yellow mucus just means your immune system has been activated. For signs your cold is getting better , look for:\nThe mucus turning clear again Your symptoms becoming less severe, like having fever body aches and less nasal congestion A week has passed and you're feeling overall better Your energy coming back What stage of infection is yellow mucus? It often is an early sign of an infection.\nDr. Scott Roberts , associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, however, cautions to not judge mucus by its color.\nHe recommends paying more attention to the consistency of the mucus — whether there is thick pus or not — to know if you have a sinus infection.\nFor example, thin mucus may be a sign of an early infection, but as the mucus thickens, this suggests more severe congestion in the nose, experts say.\nWhat does green mucus mean? Green mucus is also a sign that your body either has encountered an irritant or is experiencing an infection.\n“Mucus may go from a clearer appearance to a much more infected (pus-like) and green appearance in response to viral or bacterial infection,” Glatt says.\nThe mucus may also change from yellow to green as it becomes more concentrated, often when we are sleeping or not well hydrated.\nA common myth is that green mucus is a tell-tale sign of a bacterial infection, but both viruses and bacteria can cause this color change. In fact, past research has found that nasal discharge turns different colors due to the presence of white blood cells, which battle the infection.\nHowever, one clue you might need antibiotics is persistent thick, green discharge lasting for more than 10 days, according to Mayo Clinic .\nWhat do other mucus colors mean? Mucus often changes colors when dead cells, germs and other substances, like blood or tobacco smoke, gets mixed with it, according to Cleveland Clinic . These colors include:\nPink: Mucus can turn pink after an injury to the nose when it gets streaked with blood. It can also be a sign your nasal passages are so dry that tiny blood vessels that line them have burst and leaked blood. Brown : This may be a sign of a more severe infection like bronchitis or pneumonia. It is also common during colder seasons (when the air in our homes have less humidity), which leads to dry nasal passages that cause small amounts of blood from tiny burst blood vessels in the nose. Black : This could be old, dried blood. The mucus can also turn black when environmental irritants, like dust particles, smoke or other air pollutants, get stuck in the nasal passages. Serious fungal infections can darken mucus as well. How to get rid of mucus Druckman says “fluids and rest are key.”\n“Making sure you’re drinking enough water will help flush out any mucus and help thin it out, and getting adequate rest will help your body heal faster.”\n“Another way to reduce the effects of mucus is to place a humidifier in your room, which can help loosen your mucus a bit and make it easier to manage,” he adds.\n“For optimal drainage, it’s recommended to sleep with your head slightly elevated and to ease symptoms.”\nOther home remedies include:\nNasal rinses, which help clear the mucus from your nose and sinuses Decongestants to temporarily decrease inflammation in the nose and mouth. Expectorants to thin out the mucus so it’s easier to clear it out Antihistamines to calm down the body’s immune system, which causes excess mucus When to see a doctor If you don’t feel something is exactly right about the color or consistency of your mucus, check in with your doctor.\nThe duration of symptoms also matters. You should also seek medical attention if you have persistent colored mucus and symptoms for more than a week, Druckman adds.\nSome other warning signs are:\nDark-colored mucus Too much blood mixed in with mucus Thick nasal discharge with facial pain lasting longer than 10 days Persistent fevers Runny nose with a persistent cough or chest tightness Severe symptoms not improving with home remedies “To stay protected, I recommend getting the flu vaccine, washing hands frequently, and staying home when feeling unwell,” Druckman says.\n“Taking these steps can help reduce the spread and protect yourself and those around you during flu season.”",

    "text": "A group of teenagers travelled from Western Sydney to storm a southern Canberra home where the two occupants were repeatedly stabbed.\nAfter the youngest was arrested, he claimed he thought they left Sydney to go for a camping trip and was shocked and confused by what happened.\nThree 19-year-olds from the suburb of Mount Druitt – Lytrell Eneliko, Raven Pauga and Jacob Crichton – were all jailed over the violent home invasion, while a 17-year-old boy avoided being sent to prison.\nIn the early hours of 4 May 2024, they visited Hungry Jacks in Conder, before leaving behind rubbish from the fast food restaurant at a street near the home where they planned to commit the home invasion.\nEneliko carried a knife when he knocked on the door of the home, then stabbed the female resident four times in her arm and chest when she opened the door.\nThe masked offenders rushed inside yelling: “Where’s the money? Where’s the money?”.\n“There’s nothing here,” the woman screamed back.\nThe group forced the male resident onto a bed before Eneliko stabbed him in the arm and leg.\nAfter spending 10 minutes inside the home, the four fled, although Pauga jumped on the residents’ car as they left, smashing its windscreen.\nThe residents were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises over their bodies.\nDuring the investigation, police linked the DNA found on the discarded Hungry Jacks rubbish to Pauga and Crichton.\nPauga also made admissions to an undercover police officer, admitting they visited the ACT before the attack.\n“S-t went south and now this s-t is happening,” he told the undercover cop.\n“We all agreed to get it over with.\n“Too much hassle, aye.”\nPolice searched Eneliko’s home and found the knife used in the home invasion – still with blood on it.\nThe ACT Supreme Court heard the four all pleaded guilty to charges of burglary, inflicting grievous bodily harm and assault.\nEneliko blamed his involvement on being under the influence of drugs and alcohol, Pauga said he thought there would be a financial reward that he could pass on to his family, while the 17-year-old claimed he thought the group was going on a camping trip and he was shocked by what happened.\nActing Justice Rebecca Christensen SC said the victims were attacked without warning in their own home in an incident that was planned, premeditated and targeted.\nShe said the group didn’t know the victims and the motivation of the offending was not entirely clear.\nThe judge said all the offenders played a role in the violence inflicted on their victims, but Eneliko was the main offender as he stabbed the pair.\nEneliko was sentenced to five years’ jail suspended after 30 months, Pauga and Crichton were sentenced to four years’ jail suspended after 20 months, while the 17-year-old was given a fully suspended three-and-a-half year jail sentence.\nThe three adults were all arrested last year. As their sentences were backdated to take into account time in custody, Pauga can be released from February 2026, Crichton from April 2026 and Eneliko from November 2026.",

Este tipo de acciones se vienen replicando en el cantón ferroviario, desde que se registró la masacre.\nEn tanto que ayer, martes 8 de abril, ejecutaron acciones preventivas en mercados de la ciudad, luego de cinco denuncias ciudadanas respecto a cobros de extorsiones en estos centros de abastos, con la exigencia de montos de dinero diarios a los comerciantes.\n¿Quieres acceder a todo el contenido de calidad y sin límites? ¡SUSCRÍBETE AQUÍ!",

    "title": "2 Black Women Create Sisterhood In Baltimore City’s Fire Department",
    "text": "By Stacy Jackson ,\n2 hours ago\nAfrican American women remain underrepresented in firefighting, comprising just 8% of uniformed firefighters nationwide.\nWith only 7% of Black female firefighters in the Baltimore City Fire Department, Captain Shanntel Wilkins and EMT Tiffany Randolph are trailblazers, confronting challenges as they develop a sisterhood in the workforce.\nOut of over 1,600 employees, there are only 29 African American women in the suppression unit and eight in EMS, according to CBS News who, noted the city’s 2023 Equity Statistics . Creating a sisterhood for support and recruitment is an important mission for the Black female firefighters. Wilkins and Randolph believe their culture and perspective save lives in Baltimore’s predominantly Black communities. “You don’t get that feeling of ridicule or shame when you go to a fellow Black woman who has endured the same type of struggle,” Randolph shared. “We like to think first, especially since it’s such a dangerous job,” Randolph said about women’s approach.\nWilkins, who became a captain in September 2023, said she never saw female firefighters, growing up. “I did not think about a woman being a firefighter, she shared. “I never saw any.” Now a role model for her daughter, Wilkins has endured skepticism, jumping into the male-dominated profession. “I just woke up one day and decided I wanted to get into something my little girl could see and be proud of me,” Wilkins recalled about becoming a firefighter .\nRandolph transitioned from social work seven years ago to fulfill her passion for helping people on the frontlines, but being part of the minority takes a toll . “To come into a white male-dominated career is a second task,” she said. “It’s just task full, but not impossible.”\nWilkins shared that she has faced sly comments questioning her abilities. Her response to critics: “You walk past that.”\nThe latest census recorded Baltimore’s population is predominantly African American, with Blacks comprising roughly 63%. The Fire Department aims to boost diversity through high school training programs and Camp Spark, engaging girls’ interest in firefighting from a young age. Earlier this month, over 300 Baltimore City residents learned “Hands-Only CPR” with the fire department.\nIn January, the department spotlighted Lt. Jenell A. Taylor, who received the Firefighter of the Year Award from “Cure Operation Pulse” at Zion Baptist Church in Northeast Baltimore.\nRELATED CONTENT: BLACK FIREFIGHTERS IN CHICAGO CALL FOR JUSTICE ON MLK DAY\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Ukraine Military Situation: Trends Suggest Further Russian Gains Likely – Analysis By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Battlefield Assessment [Last week](https://rochanconsulting.substack.com/p/ukraine-conflict-monitor-20-january), Russia reportedly captured around 25 square miles of territory from Ukrainian forces, which largely remained relegated to defensive positions. Open-source intelligence and close monitoring of battlefield trends suggest that further Russian gains are likely in the coming weeks. Although its advances are not strategic in scope, the Russian military is accumulating stable tactical gains. Worse, the Kremlin’s political leadership, guided by its Soviet-remnant spy chiefs, has shown few qualms about pushing combat formations into battle even in the face of mounting casualties. Russia’s military brass, led by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, know that retaining their posts depends upon their loyalty to the Kremlin rather than on their warfighting or command prowess. With high-ranking commanders willing to kowtow to political pressure, Russia’s maximalist political objectives are guiding its invasion campaign. In a recent interview, Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), elaborated on those political objectives, claiming that Russia will not stop halfway before getting the job done, [and predicting that a sad](https://lenta.ru/news/2024/01/28/direktor-svr-naryshkin-otvetil-na-vopros-o-dalneyshey-sudbe-ukrainy/) end awaits the government of Ukraine. His words reflect the geopolitical worldview conveyed by Vladimir Putin in 2021 in his irredentist article, “On the Historical Unity of [Russians and Ukrainians](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181),” and suggest that Russia’s ultimate goal remains nothing less than the dismantling of Ukraine as a sovereign political entity. In service of this goal, Russia’s efforts on the battlefield this week continued to revolve around capturing the unoccupied remainder of Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts. Positional fighting continued on most fronts. But Russian units are not statically deployed in trenches; Putin’s war machine is moving forward. In particular, Avdiivka and its surroundings played host to intense fighting, as Russian forces [advanced](https://t.me/khornegroup/1445) near the city, though their gains came with heavy losses of personnel and armored vehicles. In the south, once the staging ground for significant Ukrainian offensive action, Russian combat formations are fighting to maintain and fortify their frontline positions. It is Russian forces who are now taking offensive action, albeit with few territorial gains, near the Robotyne bulge, Ukraine’s most significant gain from its last counteroffensive. Krnyky, the site of the Ukrainian bridgehead across the Dnipro River, also saw combat action this week. Ukrainian combat formations have so far managed to defend the bridgehead successfully. Russian aerial assaults concentrated on southern Ukraine this week. On January 25, Moscow launched waves of missiles and Iran-supplied loitering munitions at civilian infrastructure and industrial [production facilities](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-kryvorizhzhya-dron-vluchannya/32791018.html) in several Ukrainian cities. Official Ukrainian reports suggested that the main targets of the aerial assault were the strategically valuable port city of Odesa and civilian residential units, electricity networks, and gas pipelines in Kharkiv. Most of Russia’s Shahed drones were reportedly intercepted, but despite the high interception rate, the attacks killed and injured several people across multiple cities and [left thousands](https://kyivindependent.com/11-000-people-in-kharkiv-without-power/) without electricity. An open-source intelligence assessment of drone debris suggests that the Shahed-136 loitering munitions being deployed against Ukraine now possess advanced features, including [non-resonant volumetric coating (NOP) that provides these munitions with a lower](https://twitter.com/raging545/status/1751025787384238094)radar signature. Unconfirmed intelligence also suggests thermobaric warheads may have been introduced to the fight. 2. Both Sides Continue to Suffer from Insufficient Supplies of Armor Necessity is proving to be the mother of invention for Russia and Ukraine, as the protracted nature of the conflict is pushing both sides to adopt increasingly innovative concepts to deal with a dearth of supplies amid high-tempo fighting. Intelligence from the battleground shows, for example, that Russian marines [are mounting](https://twitter.com/AndreiBtvt/status/1749538021278376152) leftover RBU-6000 anti-submarine launchers onto T-80 tanks and MT-LB tractors. Ukraine is dealing with similar challenges. According to [German news reports](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/ukraine-krieg-nur-sehr-geringe-zahl-leopard-panzer-wohl-noch-im-kampf-einsatz-a-4af130dd-6c94-48dc-a23d-9a388285407d), a lack of spare parts and supply difficulties are making it difficult for Ukraine to complete regular maintenance and repair on its Leopard-2 tanks. Evidence suggests that most Leopard-2s in Kyiv’s hands are intact. However, according to [field assessments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/01/22/ukraine-isnt-running-out-of-tanks-its-running-out-of-tank-parts/?sh=2deffd0f66ea), some units have as low as 25 percent tank combat readiness. As per [official reports](https://twitter.com/deaidua/status/1749011209909576031), Ukraine is sending tank parts for repair and maintenance to Lithuania and Germany, leading to months-long delays and reducing the capabilities of Ukrainian ground forces. As Ukraine prepares for reloaded counteroffensive efforts, ensuring a sustainable and safe supply of spare parts for its repair facilities is a new strategic priority for the West. 3. As Elections Near, Troubles Haunt Putin’s Russia As the March elections near, Putin is fighting to maintain his hold on the presidency. Several political and economic factors might make Russia harder to run. According to United Kingdom intelligence sources, the Kremlin is troubled by countrywide electricity disruptions that have led to heating and power outages. Findings show that in the [past few months](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1750460042837393493), heating breakdowns affected at least 16 locations across Russia. Some sources trace the problem to an underinvestment in public services during wartime, which has exacerbated existing flaws in the country’s infrastructure. The allocation of state resources from public services to Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine could haunt Putin in the upcoming election. Resupply issues have also struck the Russian food and retail industry. Reportedly, Russians [are complaining](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1750882113891566006) about shortages of in-demand food supplies in supermarkets. A worsening economic climate could spur harsh reactions against Putin, potentially weakening his popularity. Worse, rates of alcohol abuse across the nation have reached [Soviet-era levels](https://www.moscowtimes.ru/2024/01/23/prodazhi-krepkogo-alkogolya-vrossii-stali-rekordnimi-v2023-godu-a119193). Some experts claim that this hike in alcoholism is already being reflected in a serious increase [in violent crime rates](https://jamestown.org/program/russia-faces-spike-in-crime-and-alcoholism-as-war-nears-two-year-mark/). Further worsening the problem, the Wagner private military company’s recruitment from prisons has effectively pardoned a large number of convicts once incarcerated for severe crimes. At the conclusion of their military duty, these criminals have poured into Russian society unchecked. In the meantime, early signs of rising ethnic tensions have been detected in [the recent protests](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-police-make-arrests-protest-moves-regional-capital-2024-01-19/) in Bashkortostan, Russia’s most populous republic. These developments alone will not cost Putin the election, the outcome of which has been predetermined by the Kremlin. Nor are the country’s growing difficulties likely to drag the federation into a civil war, at least not in the near term. But as Putin’s prolonged war continues to radicalize Russian society, he likely will find his fiefdom becoming increasingly unstable. - About the author: Can Kasapoğlu is a Hudson Senior Fellow - Source: This article was published [by the Hudson Institute](https://www.hudson.org/defense-strategy/ukraine-military-situation-report-january-31-can-kasapoglu)",

This represents a 10 percent increase from the previous plan, which was BRL 364.22 billion.\nThe volume of credit will support large and medium-sized rural producers in the country, including those in the National Support Program for Medium-sized Rural Producers (Pronamp), with interest rates ranging from 7 percent to 12 percent. Of the total amount, BRL 293.29 billion—an 8 percent increase—is allocated for costing and commercialization, and BRL 107.3 billion—a 16.5 percent rise—for investments.\nOf the total volume, BRL 189.09 billion will be provided at controlled interest rates, directed at Pronamp (8%) and other producers and cooperatives, while the remaining BRL 211.5 billion will be available at market rates.\nFor the Moderfrota program, which is aimed at the purchase of agricultural machinery, the interest rate will be 10.5 percent for Pronamp producers and 11.5 percent for others. For Renovagro, which focuses on recovering and converting pastures and promoting environmentally sustainable farming practices, the interest rate will be 7 percent, the same rate applied to producers financing the construction of warehouses with a capacity of up to 6,000 tons.\nFor larger warehouses and other sustainable production financing, the interest rate is 8.5 percent. For financing the modernization of production systems and the commercialization of cooperative agro-industries, the interest rate is 11.5 percent per year.\n\"It was during my and Dilma [Rousseff's] administrations that we had the largest harvest plans in the history of this country,\" said Lula in a speech during the launch of the new Harvest Plan, which has the highest nominal values of all editions of the financing program.\nFamily farming\nAt the same ceremony at the Planalto presidential palace, Lula launched the 2024/2025 Family Farming Harvest Plan, earmarking BRL 76 billion for rural credit under the National Program to Strengthen Family Farming (Pronaf). This amount is 6.2 percent higher than last year's allocation and the highest in the program's history.\nTranslation: Mario Nunes - Edition: Maria Claudia",
