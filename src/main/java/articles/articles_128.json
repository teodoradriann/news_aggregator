    "text": "El Universal Yalitza Aparicio luce impactante outfit satinado en color bronce Leer todo el artículo El Universal 5 de enero de 2024, 3:06 p. m. · 2 min de lectura\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO, enero 5 (EL UNIVERSAL).- La actriz nominada al Oscar, Yalitza Aparicio, se ha convertido en un icono de la moda. Además, ha destacado por convertirse en musa de firmas de lujo como Prada y Rodarte. En su última publicación, la actriz lució un conjunto en color bronce, de la diseñadora mexicana Cynthia Buttenklepper.\nSegún Vogue, las tonalidades tierra reinarán en 2024. Haz espacio en tu guardarropa porque el marrón, el beige, el camel, el arena, el bronce o el cobre podrían convertirse en tus mejores amigos este año.\nEl conjunto metalizado de Yalitza\nTanto Yalitza Aparicio como su stylist de cabecera, Pablo Rivera, compartieron una imagen en la que la actriz de Roma aparece posando con un pantalón y un top de textura satinada en color bronce, los cuales le brindaron luminosidad a su rostro.\nEl top, de estilo lencero, tiene un escote en V y tirantes finos. El pantalón es un modelo recto de tiro medio que tiene dos bolsas amplias abajo de la cintura, un detalle que destaca por su autenticidad. Llevó este look de diseño mexicano con unas zapatillas en color negro, con lo que confirma que los tonos tierra se llevan bien con este color.\nLa artista mexicana eligió este outfit para asistir a una presentación especial del largometraje Radical, protagonizado por Eugenio Derbez.\nEn cuanto a accesorios, Yalitza completó su look con pendientes, anillo y brazalete de Cartier y un bolso blanco de Prada. Decidió llevar el cabello lacio suelto, y un maquillaje sencillo con ojos ahumados y unos labios que lucían un tono uva.\n¿Cómo lucir el color bronce como Yalitza Aparicio?\nEste invierno los tonos metalizados se han convertido en tendencia y no solo en el maquillaje, también en la ropa, especialmente en los vestidos. El color oro y la plata, sin duda dejan huella, pero no son los únicos metales, el bronce también es ideal para robar todas las miradas. Además, agrega un toque de glamour a cualquier outfit.\nSi quieres un outfit elegante y discreto, puedes combinar prendas cobre con accesorios negros como unas medias o unos tacones, tal y como lo hizo Yalitza. Aunque también puedes apostar por un total look y conseguir unos zapatos del mismo color. Los tonos tierra suelen ser muy elegantes y combinan perfectamente entre ellos. Aunque si no quieres un look monocromático como el de Yalitza, puedes sustituir el top bronce por una camisa blanca.\nAhora que ya conoce este conjunto en color cobre de Yalitza Aparicio, ¿te gustaría lucir uno similar?\nMÁS POPULARES “La droga de Hollywood”: Kelly Clarkson, otra famosa en el medio de la polémica por el uso de Ozempic LA NACION · 4 min de lectura Rosalía reacciona a sensual anuncio de supuesto novio en ropa interior People EN ESPAÑOL · 1 min de lectura Majo Aguilar sorprende al sumarse a la tendencia \"no pants\" El Universal · 2 min de lectura La memoria se fortalece con estos 10 alimentos Yahoo Vida y Estilo · 7 min de lectura Año nuevo, zapatos como nuevos con este popular limpiador para piel rebajado a US$18 en Amazon Yahoo Compras · 3 min de lectura",

    "text": "AEPA 2015: diez años de defensa del patrimonio de Algeciras\nTribuna de opinión\nEl autor repasa los principales hitos para la creación del colectivo y las actividades promovidas en su primera década de funcionamiento\n\"Amar el patrimonio es un deber compartido, un acto de identidad colectiva\", defiende Barreno\nAlgeciras/Corría el año 2015 cuando un grupo de personas inquietas, amantes de la historia y conscientes del inmenso valor que guarda cada rincón de Algeciras, alumnos del CEPER Juan Ramón Jiménez, decidió dar un paso al frente bajo la tutela del profesor Roberto Godino Hurtado y el apoyo de la directora del centro, Carmen Fuentes Rodríguez. Así nació la Asociación de Emprendedores del Patrimonio de Algeciras -AEPA 2015- cuyo primer presidente fue Francisco López Muñoz, quien no solo vino a cubrir un vacío, sino que desde entonces ha creado un puente firme entre el pasado, el presente y el futuro de la ciudad y su patrimonio.\nDesde el principio, AEPA 2015 no ha dejado de sorprender por su dinamismo, creatividad y compromiso. Año tras año, su calendario se ha llenado de actividades que han sabido combinar el rigor histórico con la divulgación acercando de esta forma el patrimonio local a quienes quizá nunca lo habían mirado de cerca, simplemente porque no lo conocían. Visitas guiadas, rutas temáticas, conferencias, exposiciones, talleres y jornadas culturales o la presentación de libros han permitido la puesta en valor desde la Algeciras de tiempo inmemorial hasta el legado industrial, pasando por la memoria de sus barrios, sus sorprendentes historias cotidianas y la arquitectura olvidada de sus calles.\nLa creación de AEPA 2015 ha contribuido a que el patrimonio de Algeciras haya dejado de ser algo relegado a documentos, vitrinas o simples recuerdos. Se convirtió en un relato vivo en el que cada algecireño y cualquier visitante puede reconocerse y sentirse parte de él. Ha sabido demostrar que conocer es el primer paso para proteger, y que amar el patrimonio es un deber compartido, un acto de identidad colectiva.\nA lo largo de estos diez años se han sucedido bajo su prolífica actividad muchos acontecimientos dignos de remarcar como, a modo de ejemplo, la firma de dos convenios con el Ayuntamiento; la cesión de un local para nuestra sede tras la primera cesión provisional de un aula en el edificio Pérez Villalta; donación de libros y enseres por parte de diferentes algecireños para su custodia; el programa de charlas escolares en los centros de enseñanza; la visita al Parlamento de Andalucía; la rotulación de una calle con el nombre de María de la Iglesia en La Bajadilla; la concesión en 2017 del galardón del Día de Andalucía; visitas con grupos de fuera como la Coral Polifónica de Ciudad Real; innumerables visitas al reloj de la torre de la iglesia; reconocimiento por APM Terminals y subvención de 2.000 euros; nombramiento de José Luis Pavón Manso, nuestro relojero mayor, como hijo adoptivo de Algeciras; fiesta infantil al mediodía de los 31 de diciembre; el tradicional arrastre de latas; instauración del premio Patrimonio de Algeciras, concedido en su primera edición al Puerto de Algeciras o figurar como testigo en la cesión al museo de Algeciras de la importante colección de Antonio Viñas de Roa por parte de su familia, felizmente expuesta hoy en la capilla del Santo Cristo de la Alameda. Tantas y tantas actividades que sería imposible enumerarlas todas, pero que en su día quedaron fielmente reflejadas en nuestro boletín mensual de noticias que tuvo su primera aparición en abril de 2017.\nHoy, cuando echamos la vista atrás, vemos el camino recorrido y solo cabe expresar un profundo agradecimiento. Que vengan muchos años más de trabajo, descubrimiento, reivindicación del patrimonio, tanto del desaparecido, como proteger el existente para que no inicie el camino de la desaparición como ha sucedido en tantas ocasiones. Para ello contaremos con los más de 350 socios capaces de convertir cada hallazgo en un motivo de orgullo y cada historia recuperada en un legado para generaciones futuras. Seguiremos perseverando en la consecución de reivindicaciones que consideramos justas, a pesar de haberlo intentado ya sin éxito, como que un día por fin pueda sonar la guitarra de nuestro algecireño más universal, Paco de Lucía, en la torre de la iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Palma. Es un homenaje y un reconocimiento que su pueblo le debe al genio.\nDesde esta página es de justicia hacer un recordatorio a los que, de una forma u otra, bien como directivos o como socios, se embarcaron en este proyecto y que lamentablemente ya no están con nosotros. Son muchos, pero cito algunos en nombre de todos los que nos dejaron: Manolo Narváez, José María Contreras, Manolo Viñas, Juan López Ortega, Miguel A. Martín Montoya, Reyes Yera, Sofía García Millán, Justo San Salvador… Seguramente habrá algunos más, pero son aquellos que dejaron de asistir a nuestros actos porque se fueron por la puerta del silencio, aquella que impide que hayamos notado su ausencia.\nEn nombre de ellos y de todos los que seguimos componiendo este maravilloso grupo, seguiremos mirando Algeciras con los ojos de cariño y de respeto que nace del verdadero conocimiento de nuestra ciudad.",
