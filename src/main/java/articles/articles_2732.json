    "text": "Trips to the seaside may be reserved for the summer months but there’s a North Yorkshire seaside town that could buck this trend. There’s something rather lovely about a blustery day by the coast but when you combine that with the fact this seaside town is actually warmer than any other part in Yorkshire, it makes it a no brainer. Sandsend in [ North Yorkshire ](https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/all-about/north-yorkshire) is said to have its own microclimate. This means it is warmer than any other part of Yorkshire - something that could be contributing to the town’s reputation as one of the most popular places to visit on the [ Yorkshire Coast ](https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/all-about/yorkshire-coast).

Such is its popularity, [ house prices in the area to surge to around £1,000,000. ](https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/local-news/life-tiny-yorkshire-seaside-hamlet-23282377) The small village is about three miles from Whitby and you can see the famous Abbey and harbour in the distance while on the beach. Its in close proximity to the stunning North York Moors and opportunities to go sailing and golfing nearby also add to Sandsend's appeal. But what makes this tiny place all the more interesting and appealing to visitors is its very own microclimate - which makes Sandsend warmer than any other place in Yorkshire. Day-trippers from near and far flock to the beach on sunny days to enjoy the seaside towns scorching hot and sunny weather. It can often be raining in neighbouring towns such as Whitby or Scarborough but Sandsend will remain bathed in sunshine. This is because coastal town has what is known as a maritime climate or oceanic climate - which essentially gives the town milder seasons, or 'better weather' depending on whether you prefer cold or warmth. It very rarely snows, although conditions did make a treacherous drop when temperatures fell below 0C and 'danger to life' warnings were in place across parts of Yorkshire last month, in December.",

    "text": "Isabel Allende y la censura de libros en escuelas de Estados Unidos: “Es vergonzoso”\nLa escritora chilena Isabel Allende manifestó su oposición “absoluta” a la prohibición de libros, ello tras la inclusión de dos novelas suyas en una lista de casi 700 obras literarias retiradas este año de las aulas escolares de un condado de Florida, Estados Unidos.\n“Es vergonzoso y peligroso en una democracia”, alertó la autora en una declaración escrita enviada a EFE este jueves.\nLas escuelas del condado floridano de Orange retiraron de las aulas un total de 673 títulos este 2023, entre los que figuran la que es la novela más celebrada de la autora, ‘La casa de los espíritus’ (1982), además de ‘Más allá del invierno’ (2017), que en ambos casos abordan asuntos relacionados con la sexualidad.\nEl retiro de las obras se debe a una ley estatal, promovida y promulgada por el gobernador de Florida, el republicano Ron DeSantis, que limita en las escuelas obras literarias que tengan alusiones sexuales o LGBTQ+.\n“Esta medida tendrá el efecto contrario al deseado por el gobernador, ya que basta que algo se les prohíba a los jóvenes para que quieran leerlo”, aseveró la escritora, quien reside en Estados Unidos.\nLa chilena recalcó que no es la única autora censurada en el sur de Estados Unidos, ni tampoco la primera vez que la vetan en las escuelas ya que años atrás “La Casa de los Espíritus” fue censurada en Carolina del Norte, pero “un grupo de maestros defendió el libro ante la Junta de Educación del estado (Board of Education) y lo reinstalaron”, relató.\nEntre los títulos retirados por las autoridades escolares del condado de Orange, donde se asienta la ciudad de Orlando, figuran obras de otros celebrados autores latinoamericanos como Gabriel García Márquez, cuyas novelas ‘El amor en los tiempos del cólera’ (1985) y ‘Crónica de una muerte anunciada’ (1981) ya no están en las aulas.",

    "text": "[Portugal-Croácia](/tag/Portugal-Cro%25C3%25A1cia) Liga das Nações: Portugal-Croácia, 2-1 (destaques) E ele insiste, teimosamente, em continuar a fazer História E ele insiste, teimosamente, em continuar a fazer História A FIGURA: Cristiano Ronaldo Depois de mais uma fase final sem golos, o avançado português respondeu às críticas com um jogo muito positivo. O golo 900 abrilhantou-lhe a noite, mas CR7 foi mais do que esse momento. Jogou de forma associativa e pisou os espaços certos. Antes do golo esteve perto de marcar numa das jogadas coletivas mais bonitas da noite e ainda assistiu Nuno Mendes, já na segunda parte, para uma boa ocasião de golo negada por Livakovic. O MOMENTO: minuto 34. Golo 900 da carreira de Cristiano Ronaldo Aos 39 anos pode não ser o jogador de outros tempos. Perdeu capacidade de drible, velocidade, mas continua a ser um dos homens mais letais nas áreas contrárias. O cruzamento de Nuno Mendes foi perfeito, mas a forma como CR7 finalizou de primeira meteu respeito. A História a escrever-se à nossa frente: na Luz, a 5 de setembro de 2024, o maior goleador de sempre do futebol mundial chegou aos 900 golos oficiais na carreira, 131 de quinas ao peito. OUTROS DESTAQUES Bruno Fernandes: teve, tal como muitos dos companheiros, um Euro 2024 individualmente aquém das expetativas, talvez muito por culpa do peso que uma época inteira teve [num dos jogadores mais utilizados do Mundo](https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/observatorio-do-futebol/cies/estudo-bruno-fernandes-lidera-em-minutos-na-europa-aursnes-em-portugal). A leveza que ainda tem nas pernas em 2024/25 nota-se mesmo à distância, lá bem perto da cobertura do Estádio da Luz. Na forma como procura a bola, como compensa defensivamente as limitações defensivas de Rafael Leão e na agilidade mental que lhe permite tomar, como poucos, boas decisões. Como na assistência para o golo de Dalot e numa triangulação perfeita com Leão e Ronaldo que adiou alguns minutos o golo 900 de CR7 na carreira. Diogo Dalot: inaugurou o marcador ao aparecer com um movimento à ponta de lança numa zona onde é pouco habitual um lateral-direito aparecer. Na segunda parte negou de carrinho uma excelente ocasião de golo de Pasalic numa transição perigosa. Um autogolo foi um percalço num jogo muito consistente. Nuno Mendes: esteve ligado à corrente do primeiro ao último minuto, com desequilíbrios constantes pelo corredor esquerdo. Assistiu Cristiano Ronaldo para o golo 900 da carreira do avançado e ainda apareceu em condições de marcar em pelo menos duas ocasiões. Na primeira parte dividiu o flanco esquerdo com Rafael Leão, mas na segunda reclamou-o todo. E bem! Kramaric: o mais perigoso dos croatas na primeira parte. Disponibilidade física, mobilidade e poder de fogo. Ameaçou o golo, negado por Diogo Costa, aos 31 minutos e desequilibrou num movimento em profundidade na jogada do golo da Croácia a fechar a primeiro. Livakovic: nada podia fazer nos golos sofridos, mas fez muito para negar outros golos de Portugal. A Bruno Fernandes, a Cristiano Ronaldo e fica a sensação que ainda tocou de raspão naquela tentativa de Pedro Neto sacudida pela trave.",
