    "title": "Ramadan in UAE: This Kyrgyz expat misses community iftar, praying together back home - News | Khaleej Times",
    "text": "For Dubai resident Asangaziev Elim, Ramadan brings him memories of his hometown in Kyrgyzstan. A Muslim-majority country, Kyrgyzstan is rich of its cultures and traditions.\nElim, who arrived in Dubai four years ago, said he missed the warmth and togetherness of his hometown Issyk Kul the most during Ramadan.\n“My town is located roughly 3.5 hours away from capital Bishkek,” said Elim. “We have a beautiful lake in our town, and we get a lot of visitors in the area because of that. Most of my cousins and extended family stay in the same locality.”\nFondest memories For him, one of the fondest memories of the month was the community iftar organised at the local mosque. “I would join my friends and cousins at the mosque and all the boys would have different responsibilities,” he said.\nStay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.\n“Younger boys would be in charge of going out and gathering fruits to prepare dessert while the older ones would take up the job of peeling, cutting and cooking. Our responsibilities changed as we grew older. So, after years of being tasked with collecting fruit or laying out the seating, when you are put in charge of ‘older’ people’s jobs like cutting and cooking, it makes you feel very grown up.”\nThe preparation would start at least two hours before iftar. Once the cooking is over, they would invite the less fortunate in the area for iftar and then join them in a communal meal.\nElim, who lives in Dubai with his wife and two-year-old daughter, said he misses that community feeling. “For us, Ramadan meant toiling for the less fortunate,” he said.\n“That tradition instilled in all of us a sense of giving. I hope that once my daughter is a little older, I can take her to the mosque back home and teach her the same values.”\nPraying together Another of Elim’s memories is going for the Taraweeh prayers together with his cousins and friends. “The mosque was just a walking distance away from our home,” he recalled. “After dinner, my friends and cousins — who were also my neighbours — would all come together in one place, and we would walk to the mosque. It was a time of great fun that none of us wanted to miss out.”\nThe prayers in Elim’s hometown began later in the night than in Dubai. “It would almost be midnight by the time we finished,” he said. “So sometimes, we would feel sleepy but just being in the mosque and offering the prayers with our family was a great feeling.”",

    "title": "A cut undersea internet cable is making Taiwan worried about 'gray zone' tactics from Beijing",
    "text": "⁣ ⁢Earlier this month,​ a critical undersea ⁤internet ⁢cable​ near Taiwan was damaged,‌ sparking immediate action from local telecom providers to reroute ⁣traffic⁣ and maintain⁤ connectivity for users ⁤across the⁤ island.​ The incident, though, took a more ominous turn when a “suspicious ‍vessel” was spotted near the affected area, ⁤raising alarms about potential sabotage.\n⁤\n​ Chunghwa Telecom, one of Taiwan’s leading internet service providers, reported the damage⁣ to the Taiwan Coast ​Guard. According to the company’s statement, the vessel was observed along the ⁢same route as the compromised ‍cable.⁢ While no direct evidence has been​ presented linking the⁢ ship to ⁢the damage, suspicions⁣ have fallen on the Shunxin39, a cargo vessel⁣ with ties to China.\n⁢ ⁣ The Taiwan ‍coast Guard has been cautious in its assessment, ​stating that it cannot definitively determine ⁢the vessel’s intentions. In a recent statement, officials called for international cooperation, particularly from South Korea, where the ship was reportedly headed, to assist in the ongoing examination.\n⁣ This incident⁣ has heightened concerns⁣ among Taiwanese authorities about what they describe as “gray zone⁢ operations” – actions that fall‍ short of outright ‍conflict but could still disrupt critical infrastructure. Such⁢ operations,particularly those targeting undersea cables,could severely⁣ impact ⁤Taiwan’s ability to communicate with ​the rest of the world,a vulnerability that has not gone unnoticed.\n‍ The damaged cable is part of a broader network that connects Taiwan to global internet hubs, making it a vital lifeline for both domestic and international communications. While ⁤the immediate impact was mitigated by‌ swift action from‌ telecom providers, the incident ⁣underscores the island’s reliance on these undersea links and the potential risks they face.\n​\n⁣ ⁣As ‍tensions ⁣in the region continue to simmer, this event serves as ⁢a stark reminder of the fragility of global communication networks. For Taiwan, the stakes are particularly high, as‌ any disruption to its internet infrastructure could have far-reaching‍ consequences, both economically and strategically.\nTaiwan’s Coast Guard has identified a‌ Cameroon-⁤ and Tanzania-flagged vessel,operated by seven Chinese nationals,as the suspected ‍culprit‌ behind the damage to an undersea communication cable off ‌the ​island’s​ northeastern coast last Friday. The​ incident ⁣has raised⁤ concerns about potential disruptions to Taiwan’s international communications,with officials suggesting it might very​ well be​ part of a broader strategy by Beijing to prepare for a ‍future blockade⁤ or⁤ quarantine of the self-ruled island.\nAccording to a Taiwanese⁣ official, the use​ of ‍ships with “flags of convenience”​ to target critical infrastructure​ like​ undersea cables might potentially ⁤be a tactic to sever‍ Taiwan’s global connectivity.⁤ “such ⁤an act ​could‍ be part of Beijing-backed efforts to use ships with flags of‌ convenience to cut Taiwan’s international communication as a form of ⁣readiness for future‌ blockade‌ and quarantine,” the official stated.\nhowever, ⁢Beijing⁢ has dismissed these claims, with the Taiwan Affairs⁢ Office describing ⁤the cable ⁣damage as ⁢a ​“common maritime incident.” The office criticized taipei for‍ “conjecturing” and “intentional framing of gray zone threats,” rejecting any⁤ suggestion of intentional sabotage.\nGuo ⁢Wenjie,a Chinese national and director of the company ⁢operating the vessel,also denied involvement in the incident. In a statement ‍to Reuters, Guo asserted that the⁣ ship was not responsible for the damage, adding another layer‍ of complexity to the ongoing investigation.\nThis incident is ⁢not isolated.In recent years, there have been ⁣multiple reports of undersea ⁣infrastructure ⁤being damaged worldwide, including high-profile ‍cases ⁤in the ​Baltic Sea involving Chinese ships.⁤ These events have fueled ⁣speculation about‌ the potential use of maritime operations to disrupt⁣ global communications, particularly in regions with‍ geopolitical tensions.\nTaiwan, which Beijing claims as part of ⁤its territory,‌ has faced increasing pressure from China, including military maneuvers and‍ economic coercion. The island’s authorities ⁤remain vigilant, particularly regarding threats to ‌its critical‌ infrastructure, which plays‌ a vital role in ⁣maintaining its sovereignty and global connectivity.\nAs investigations continue, the ​incident underscores the fragility of undersea cables and the geopolitical ⁤risks they face in an increasingly tense ‌international habitat. Whether accidental or intentional, the damage ⁤to Taiwan’s communication infrastructure highlights the island’s vulnerability and ⁢the broader challenges it faces in ​safeguarding its independence.\nTaiwan’s Submarine Cable Vulnerabilities: A Growing Concern Amid Rising Tensions Recent damage to two submarine internet⁣ cables connecting Taiwan’s ‌outlying island of Matsu has raised alarms about the ⁤island’s digital infrastructure. While authorities ⁤have not definitively labeled⁢ the‌ incidents as deliberate acts, experts⁤ warn⁢ that such disruptions could have severe consequences ‌for Taiwan’s economy and global connectivity.\nSu Tzu-yun, a military analyst at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defense and Security Research,⁣ emphasized ⁣the need for further ‌investigation to determine ​whether‍ the cable damage was intentional. “More evidence is​ required to ​confirm if this was a targeted act,” ‍he said. Though, Su stressed the importance of enhancing maritime surveillance and ​defense mechanisms to protect these critical underwater links.\nSubmarine cables are the backbone of Taiwan’s digital economy, facilitating ‍international trade,​ banking, and communication. “If⁣ these cables​ are sabotaged, Taiwan’s connection to the ‍global ⁢community could be severed,” Su explained.⁣ “We would then have to rely on satellite bandwidth, which ​is far less efficient and ⁤could cripple our​ digital infrastructure.” He‌ described such potential sabotage as a ​form ​of⁣ “psychological warfare,” designed to ⁢destabilize Taiwan’s economy and international relations.\nOther experts have speculated ‌that the recent ‍incidents might be part of a‍ broader strategy. Tom Shugart, a ⁢retired US Navy‍ captain and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American ⁤Security, suggested that the damage⁤ could be ‌a test run for future ‍operations. “While this doesn’t appear to be a serious attempt to⁢ disrupt Taiwan’s ‌connectivity,it might‌ very well be a low-level ​harassment‍ tactic or a precursor to ‍larger-scale coercive actions,” he said.\nThe ⁣incidents have sparked concerns about Taiwan’s vulnerability to‌ such disruptions, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions. ⁤Submarine cables are notoriously arduous to repair, often requiring specialized ships and months of work. Any prolonged disruption ⁤could have cascading effects on ‍Taiwan’s economy, which ‍relies heavily on digital trade ⁤and communication.\nIn response, Taiwan is reportedly exploring ways to ⁣bolster ‍its maritime defenses and diversify its communication infrastructure.Satellite ⁢technology, while a potential backup, is not a‌ viable ⁤long-term solution due to its limited bandwidth and higher costs. Experts agree that protecting submarine​ cables must be a top priority for ⁤Taiwan’s ⁤national security strategy.\nAs tensions in the region continue to escalate,the security of Taiwan’s digital ​infrastructure remains a critical issue. The recent cable damage serves as a stark reminder of the island’s vulnerabilities and the need for proactive measures to safeguard its ​connectivity to the world.\nRising Tensions in ⁢the ⁤Taiwan Strait: China’s Military ⁤and Gray Zone Tactics In recent months, ‍the Taiwan Strait and the⁣ Western​ Pacific have become hotspots ⁤of heightened⁤ military activity, with China substantially increasing its presence‍ in the region. Chinese naval and coast‍ guard‍ vessels have been frequently spotted navigating these⁣ waters, accompanied by a noticeable uptick in aircraft operations around‌ Taiwan. This⁤ escalation aligns with Beijing’s broader strategy of asserting dominance over the area, raising concerns among Taiwanese officials and defense experts.\nWhile conventional military maneuvers remain a focal point, attention has increasingly shifted toward China’s use of “gray zone tactics.” ​These strategies involve non-military actors,‍ such as the China Coast guard, maritime ⁤safety agencies, and even civilian vessels operating as part of a “maritime militia.” ⁢These groups could ‌play ⁤a critical role ⁤in enforcing a quarantine or blockade around Taiwan, should⁢ Beijing decide to take more aggressive steps toward asserting control.\nin a‌ groundbreaking ​move,⁣ Taiwanese ‍authorities recently conducted a “tabletop” exercise​ to simulate potential military escalations by China. This ​exercise, held late last month, ⁢involved multiple⁢ government⁢ agencies tasked with addressing‍ a‍ wide range of threats⁢ beyond ⁢conventional ⁣armed invasion. Among these threats was the growing‌ challenge of ‌information warfare, which has become a ⁢key ⁢component of modern conflict.\nDuring the⁣ simulation, officials highlighted the difficulties⁢ of countering​ misinformation during critical infrastructure disruptions, such as electricity or internet outages. “Government agencies struggled ‌to clarify falsehoods during these⁤ scenarios,” one‌ official noted,emphasizing the urgent⁣ need for Taiwan to develop robust backup systems to maintain ‌the flow ‍of accurate information during crises.\nAs tensions continue to rise,⁣ Taiwan is taking ⁣proactive steps⁤ to bolster its defenses and resilience. The island nation is ‍not only preparing for⁤ potential military confrontations but ‍also addressing the subtler,‍ yet equally dangerous, tactics employed by Beijing. The combination of military pressure ⁢and ⁢gray zone strategies ⁣underscores the complexity of the situation, ⁢making it a critical issue for regional stability and global security.\nFor now, ⁣the focus remains on ensuring that Taiwan can effectively respond ‍to a multifaceted threat landscape,‌ safeguarding​ its ⁢sovereignty and the well-being of‍ its citizens in an increasingly⁣ uncertain geopolitical environment.\n‌ ⁢ ⁤ ⁢ ‌ Taiwan’s Ministry of digital Affairs has recently unveiled plans ⁤to bolster the ⁢island’s communication infrastructure by exploring innovative solutions, including low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites⁤ and the establishment of new submarine cable stations. These initiatives⁢ aim ​to ​enhance connectivity​ and⁤ ensure resilience ⁤in the ⁤face of growing geopolitical tensions.\n‌ ​ ⁢ ‍In a recent briefing, Taiwan’s tech czar,‌ Wu Cheng-wen, revealed‍ that the government is not only collaborating with ‍LEO satellite ⁢provider OneWeb but is also in advanced discussions with Amazon’s Project Kuiper. These ⁣partnerships are expected to‍ significantly expand Taiwan’s satellite capabilities,​ providing a robust alternative⁣ to traditional communication methods.\n⁤ ‌\n​ The⁤ urgency ‌of these efforts has been underscored‌ by a series of‍ incidents⁤ involving Chinese and Russian vessels, which⁣ have raised ​concerns ‌about ‌the vulnerability of undersea infrastructure. For instance, Swedish authorities are currently investigating the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 for its potential​ involvement in‌ the damage of two undersea fiber-optic cables in the Baltic Sea‌ last November. This incident bears striking similarities⁣ to ​a 2023 case⁤ where the Chinese ship NewNew Polar Bear was suspected⁤ of damaging both undersea cables and a gas pipeline in the same⁣ region.\n⁣ ‌\nIn late November, Finnish authorities detained a Russian oil tanker suspected ‍of damaging critical underwater infrastructure. Investigators believe ‌the vessel’s anchor‍ may have⁤ dragged across ⁢the seabed, ‌severing the Estlink‍ 2⁤ power ⁣cable connecting Finland and Estonia, as well as several internet⁢ cables. This​ incident has raised concerns about the vulnerability of undersea networks, which are vital for global communication and⁣ energy⁤ transmission.\n⁤\n‌ ‍ This is not the frist time submarine ‌cables‍ have⁢ been ⁤compromised. Earlier this year,in March,telecom ⁣networks in the Red Sea region where disrupted after multiple undersea cables were cut. The⁤ incident occurred weeks after yemen’s ⁣government warned that Houthi rebels might ‌target these cables. While the group denied‍ duty, the event highlighted the fragility of underwater infrastructure and the potential for geopolitical tensions to spill over⁣ into critical ⁢systems.\n‍\n⁢ ‍ While ‌accidental damage to undersea cables is not⁢ uncommon, experts are‍ increasingly concerned about deliberate acts of sabotage. According ‍to Thomas Shugart of the ⁣Center for a New American Security (CNAS), “There does seem to ⁢be a number of breakages recently that seem to have been deliberate, including those done ‘by ⁣or for ‍Russian or Chinese interests.’” Such actions, whether intentional⁤ or not, underscore the need for enhanced security ​measures ⁢to protect these‍ essential networks.\n​\n‌ ⁤ The recent ‍incidents serve as a stark reminder of ​the ⁢interconnected nature of global infrastructure. Undersea cables, often overlooked, ⁤are the backbone of international communication‌ and energy grids. Their disruption can⁤ have far-reaching‍ consequences,‌ affecting everything from⁣ financial markets to​ emergency services. ‍As tensions rise in various ⁣regions, the ​risk of deliberate interference with these cables ⁢grows, making it imperative‌ for​ nations to collaborate on safeguarding⁣ these critical assets.\n⁢ ‌ ⁣ In an ⁢era where digital connectivity is paramount, the protection of undersea ‍infrastructure must become a global priority. Governments and private entities alike​ must invest in advanced monitoring technologies and international agreements to prevent future disruptions. the stakes are high, and ⁣the consequences of inaction could be catastrophic for ‌global stability and economic security.\nMastering WordPress SEO:‍ A Extensive Guide to Boosting Your Website’s⁢ Visibility Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the backbone⁢ of any ‍prosperous website, and ⁢WordPress, being one⁢ of the most⁢ popular⁢ content management systems, offers⁣ a wealth of tools and strategies ‍to help you dominate search engine rankings. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user, ⁢understanding the ​nuances of WordPress SEO can significantly ⁢enhance ​your‌ site’s performance.Let’s dive into the three core pillars of wordpress⁣ SEO: On-Page, On-Site, and Off-Site optimization.\nOn-Page SEO: Crafting Content That Ranks On-Page SEO focuses on optimizing individual ⁢pages to improve ⁣their search engine visibility.​ This involves creating high-quality, keyword-rich content that ⁢resonates with your‍ audience.

    "title": "Startup’s “AI” tool spams GitHub repositories with bogus commits, without consent",
    "text": "Update: that was quick! GitHub\n[banned the “AI” company’s account](https://github.com/lattaai9). Only GitHub gets to spam AI on GitHub, thank you very much.\nMost of the time, products with “AI” features just elicit sighs, especially when the product category in question really doesn’t need to have anything to do with “AI” in any way, shape, or form. More often than not, though, such features are not only optional and easily ignorable, and we can always simply choose not to buy or use said products in the first place. I mean, over the last few days I’ve migrated my Pixel 8 Pro from stock Google Android to GrapheneOS as the final part of my platform transition away from big tech, and Google’s insistence on shoving “AI” into everything certainly helped in spurring this along.\nBut what are you supposed to do if an “AI” product forces itself upon you? What if you can’t run away from it? What if, one day, you open your GitHub repository and see a bunch of useless PRs from an “AI” bot who claims to help you fix issues, without you asking it to do so? Well, that’s what’s happening to a bunch of GitHub users who were unpleasantly surprised to see garbage, useless merge requests from a random startup testing out some “AI” tool that attempts to automatically ‘fix’ open issues on GitHub.\nThe proposed ‘fixes’ are accompanied by a disclaimer:\nDisclaimer: The commit was created by Latta AI and you should never copy paste this code before you check the correctness of generated code. Solution might not be complete, you should use this code as an inspiration only.\nThis issue was tried to solve for free by Latta AI –\n[https://latta.ai/ourmission]\nIf you no longer want Latta AI to attempt solving issues on your repository, you can block this account.\n[↫ Example of a public open issue with the “AI” spam]\nLet me remind you: this tool, called “Latta AI”, is doing all of this unprompted, without consent, and the commits generally seem bogus and useless, too, in that they don’t actually fix any of the issues. To make matters worse, your GitHub repository will then automatically appear as part of its marketing – again without any consent or permission from the owners of the GitHub projects in question.\nClicking through to the GitHub repositories listed on the front page will reveal a lot about how developers are responding: they’re not amused. Every link I clicked on had Latta AI’s commit and comment marked as spam, abuse, or just outright deleted. We’re talking public open issues here, so it’s not like developers aren’t looking for input and possible fixes from third parties – they just want that input and those possible fixes to come from real humans, not some jank code generator that’s making us destroy the planet even faster.\nThis is what the future of “AI” really looks like. It’s going to make spam even easier to make, even more pervasive, and even cheaper, and it’s going to infest everything. Nothing will be safe from these monkeys on typewriters, and considering what the spread of misinformation by human-powered troll farms can do, I don’t think we’re remotely ready for what “AI” is going to mean for our society. I can assure you lying about brown people eating cats and dogs will be remembered as quaint before this nonsense is over.",

Negotiation is a courageous expression. When you are defeated, when you see things are not going well, you need to have the courage to negotiate. You hesitate, but how will this war end with how many deaths?\n\"We need to look for a country to mediate. Today, there are many countries willing to mediate in the war in Ukraine, for example. Türkiye made a proposal to initiate the process. Do not hesitate to negotiate before things get worse,” he said.\nFrancis, who said he talks with the Catholic community in the Gaza Strip that is under Israeli attack every day, noted that leaders tell him about their experiences and describe it as a war.\n# Pope Francis # Türkiye # Russia-Ukraine war",
