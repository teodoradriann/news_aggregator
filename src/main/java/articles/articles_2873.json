    "title": "Nasos Gavelas: The Paralympian Gold Bent – “They told me maybe you can’t run?” – 2024-09-05 20:47:05",
    "text": "Nasos Gavelas achieved great success for Greece at the Paralympic Games by winning the gold medal in the 100 meters with a time of 11.02″. T11 piloted by Ioannis Nyfantopoulos who is the second for our country in Paris.\nThe athlete and his pilot, Giannis Nyfantopoulos, celebrated this great victory together.\nSee also: Paralympics: Unlikely Gavelas, “Gold” Also in Paris (Video)\nThe Paralympic gold medalist in his statements to ERT, after the great success, said that “I still haven’t understood it” and that it is “very beautiful and very heavy. It’s incredible to hear our national anthem in this stadium.” “When you have worked so hard you have nothing to fear,” he added, among other things.\n“Goodbye… I won’t talk about myself, I’ll talk about the people who helped me and one of them is this crazy guy who has been giving his life for two months now. Like with Mitsos, we put our heart and soul last year but he was injured. We came here to show who’s in charge in the 100 meters, we didn’t come to lose but to win.”\nWith tears in her eyes, she said: “Thank God blessed the gold medal to come. I can’t believe it. Two months with Giannis… I was in a difficult psychological situation, after Dimitris’ injury, no one can imagine how difficult it was. When everyone told me “ What happened to Gavela? Are you done? Can’t you run?” No boy . It’s not that I can’t run, it’s that I want a smile and people who believe in me more than twice to win.”\nHe added: “I’m not alone, Giannis is too. We ran to the end. He said to me ‘listen to me, I’ll run, if you want, fall and crawl, it hurts, you’ll graze yourself’. And I thought: ‘No man, it’s a shame. Don’t get killed, get killed at the finish line and beat them by three centimetres’ and that’s what happened”.\nYannis Nyfantopoulos said: “I am moved and happy for this boy, for the effort he made. I had a difficult task because the previous boys who were in my position had left a heavy legacy. All I wanted was for Nasos to cross the finish line first. I promised his father that I would make him scream and cry, as he asked. I hope I have done it and that he is happy for his son. And above all that Nassos enjoys it.”\n“We will burn it together,” Nassos Gavelas said to Yannis Anifandopoulos, adding “let me tell you, we will burn it. See you in Brussels at the Diamond League. Let’s go celebrate it there with Karalis and Tedoglou because they will not be alone at OAKA.”\n#Nasos #Gavelas #Paralympian #Gold #Bent #told #run",

    "text": "Nearly one million people are food insecure in Tampa Bay. Here at ABC Action News, we’ve teamed up with Feeding Tampa Bay for our Food for Families initiative. A huge part of making their mission happen comes down to the volunteers. “I always tell all the groups that come this is going to be the quickest two hours of your week,” said Diane Martinez. On Thursdays at Feeding Tampa Bay’s Trinity Café off Nebraska Avenue in Tampa, you’ll find Diane and Willie Martinez giving back to the very community they live in. “We moved into this neighborhood a little over five years ago, and we noticed that some of our neighbors, some people in the community had unmet needs, and we were concerned about that, so we went online and were looking for opportunities to help, and we found Trinity Café, and it fit the bill perfect,” said Diane. Diane and Willie have been married for 24 years, and they’re valued members of the team. “We met working in the schools, and we used to work together there, and so when we’re back here again volunteering for those two hours, I look up, and it reminds me of when we first met,” said Diane. At the café, they set up tables, greet guests, and serve lunch. “I’m the floater, so I help everybody else. I help the people who don’t speak English,” said Willie. “I speak to them in Spanish.” Even deeper, they care and get to know the people who walk through the doors, while encouraging everyone to give back their time too. “We make friends with everybody,” said Willie. “We see our customers from Trinity out and about in the community, and sometimes we can help them out a little bit if we can, and so that’s been rewarding for us,” said Diane.",

    "text": "30 nov, 2024 - 05:15 • Lusa O Sindicato dos Trabalhadores do Comércio, Escritórios e Serviços de Portugal (CESP) convocou para este sábado uma greve dos trabalhadores das Santas Casas de Misericórdia, reivindicando um aumento dos salários, anunciou a estrutura sindical. O CESP marcou também para este sábado, quando se realiza uma Assembleia Geral da União das Misericórdias Portuguesas (UMP) em Fátima, uma concentração de trabalhadores em greve no mesmo local, disse à agência Lusa Catarina Fachadas, dirigente do sindicato. Segundo a sindicalista, os trabalhadores reivindicam o aumento pedido para 2024 \"de 150 euros a partir do salário mínimo\" para todos. Em relação à greve, Catarina Fachadas referiu que a falta de funcionários obriga a que em muitos estabelecimentos se trabalhe ao nível dos serviços mínimos, o que dificulta a adesão à paralisação. Além do aumento dos salários de todos, os trabalhadores reivindicam a celebração de um Contrato Coletivo de Trabalho entre o CESP e a UMP, com todos os direitos já conquistados, \"tanto no Acordo de Empresa da UMP, como na Portaria de Extensão do CCT das IPSS [Instituições Particulares de Solidariedade Social], nomeadamente o pagamento de diuturnidades\".",

    "text": "Rauw Alejandro gave fans an unforgettable moment during his sold-out Los Angeles concert when a high-energy dance move led to an unexpected wardrobe malfunction. While performing 'No Me Sueltes' at the Intuit Dome, the front of his pants ripped mid-routine, but the Latin superstar didn’t miss a beat. Laughing it off and handling the moment like a pro, Rauw kept performing as fans captured the incident on camera. The viral moment exploded across social media, adding to the buzz of his historic achievement as the first Latin artist to sell out three nights at the venue. Known for hits like “Todo de Ti,” “Afrodisíaco,” and “Tú Con Él,” Rauw’s performance proved he's as fearless onstage as he is talented.",
