    "title": "La NBA desafía a Estados Unidos",
    "text": "En el Mundial del verano pasado de Indonesia y Filipinas, en el que Estados Unidos sumó un decepcionante cuarto puesto tras caer contra Alemania en las semifinales, su entrenador, el legendario Steve Kerr , cinco anillos de la NBA como jugador y tres como técnico, resumió a la perfección tras la derrota cuál es el panorama del baloncesto internacional en la actualidad. «El juego se ha globalizado en los últimos 30 años, ya no estamos en 1992. Los partidos se han vuelto muy difíciles. Los jugadores son mejores en todo el mundo, los equipos son mejores y no es fácil conseguir una victoria», resumía el estadounidense. Una realidad que tendrá su máxima expresión en los Juegos de París . En la capital gala se batirá el récord de jugadores que actualmente disputan la NBA, un total de 52 de los 144 (36.1%) que integran los 12 equipos que aspiran al oro. En Tokio 2020 fueron 48 y en Río 2016 , 46. Unas cifras que chocan con las de Barcelona 92, edición olímpica en la que Estados Unidos comenzó a convocar a las grandes estrellas de su liga y no a sus promesas universitarias. En la cita española, además de los 11 jugadores NBA de los Estados Unidos, solo había ocho baloncestistas más que brillaban al otro lado del Atlántico. La NBA ya no desafía al mundo. Es la NBA el mayor peligro al que se enfrenta Estados Unidos. Cierto es que la selección estadounidense ha creado un grupo espectacular para tal desafío, liderado por supercampeones como LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers), Kevin Durant (Phoenix Suns) o Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors); bien empaquetado por estrellas como Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers), Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics), Anthony Edwards (Minnesota Timberwolves), Devin Booker (Suns) o Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers); y cimentado con auténticos muros defensivos como Anthony Davis (Lakers), Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat), Jrue Holiday y Derrick White (ambos de los Celtics). Pero la competencia es más que real. Es Canadá el segundo conjunto que más NBA tiene después de sus vecinos, un total de 10. Bronce en el último Mundial , los norteamericanos están entrenados por el español Jordi Fernández y liderados en la pista por Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , que viene de promediar 30 puntos por noche con los Oklahoma City Thunder. Con Jamal Murray (Denver Nuggets) formará una pareja exterior que aspira a ser letal, mientras que Dillon Brooks (Houston Rockets) y Luguentz Dort (Thunder) pondrán la mala leche y el músculo. RJ Barrett (New York Knicks), Nickeil Alexander-Walker (Timberwolves), Trey Lyles (Sacramento Kings), Andrew Nembhard (Pacers), Kelly Olynyk (Toronto Raptors) y Dwight Powell (Dallas Mavericks) completan el grupo de élite de los canadienses. Noticia Relacionada Baloncesto estandar No Sergio Llull amplía contrato con el Real Madrid hasta 2025 Jorge Abizanda El balear, con 1.083 partidos, es ya el jugador que más encuentros ha disputado con la camiseta blancaEl podio lo cierra Australia , bronce en Tokio 2020. Los de las antípodas, uno de los equipos más competitivos de siempre en las citas internacionales, cuentan con ocho jugadores de la liga estadounidense. Son Patty Mills (Atlanta Hawks), Josh Giddey (Chicago Bulls), Joe Ingles (Orlando Magic), Dante Exum y Josh Green (Mavericks), Dyson Daniels (Atlanta Hawks), Jock Landale (Rockets) y Duop Reath (Portland Trail Blazers). Detrás de los australianos aparece Francia , plata hace tres años, anfitriona y con cinco atletas de categoría NBA. Victor Wembanyama , de 20 años, con 2,24 metros de altura, una envergadura de 244 centímetros y estrella de los San Antonio Spurs, es la gran baza para no decepcionar a sus aficionados, pese a que los galos han perdido los últimos cuatro partidos de preparación para los Juegos, ante Alemania, Serbia, Canadá y Australia. Rudy Gobert (Timberwolves), Evan Fournier (Detroit Pistons), Nicolas Batum (Los Angeles Clippers) y Bilal Coulibaly (Washington Wizards) también juegan en Estados Unidos. Alemania , actual campeona del mundo, tiene cuatro: Dennis Schröder (New Jersey Nets), Daniel Theis (New Orleans Pelicans) y los hermanos Wagner, Franz y Mo (los dos juegan en los Orlando Magic). Por su parte, Serbia posee los mismos que los germanos. Son Bogdan Bogdanovic (Hawks), Vasilije Micic (Charlotte Hornets), Nikola Jovic (Heat) y, por descontado, Nikola Jokic , campeón de la NBA con los Nuggets en 2023 y nombrado mejor jugador de la NBA en 2021, 2022 y 2024. En el grupo de cola, con solo un representante, están España, Grecia, Japón, Puerto Rico y Sudán del Sur. Nuestra selección solo cuenta con Santi Aldama (Memphis Grizzlies), pues Usman Garuba vio cómo los Warriors rescindían su contrato el mes pasado. Los helenos están liderados por Giannis Antetokounmpo , MVP de la NBA en 2019, 2020 y campeón de la misma en 2021 con los Milwaukee Bucks, mientras que los asiáticos cuentan con el talento de Rui Hachimura (Lakers). En el conjunto caribeño está José Alvarad o (Pelicans) y en el africano JT Thor (Hornets). El sábado, con el España-Australia, comenzará la lucha entre el \\u0027Dream Team\\u0027 y la NBA por el oro olímpico.",

    "title": "What happened to Japan after WW2?",
    "text": "Unlike Germany, [Japan](https://wegotthiscovered.com/tag/japan) has managed to elude much of the negative connotations attached to the Axis powers during [World War 2](https://wegotthiscovered.com/tag/World-war-2/). By the Cold War, Japan was America’s premier ally in the Asia Pacific region. By the early aughts, it was synonymous with anime, sushi, and its many cultural staples. The enemies-to-allies tale came on the heels of years of war, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the horrific introduction of the atomic bombs over [Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://wegotthiscovered.com/fyi/why-was-hiroshima-chosen-as-the-bombing-site/), and the deaths of more than 2.5 million Japanese citizens. History shows multiple instances where [American involvement bred hostility](https://wegotthiscovered.com/fyi/what-happened-to-vietnam-after-ww2/), but despite 8 years of occupation, Japan remains one of the U.S. most ardent allies. The end of WWII and the American occupation By the time Japan surrendered in August of 1945, the country was devastated. More than 2.5 million people perished during the war — 500,000 among them civilians. The Allied powers, mostly the U.S. Airforce, laid heavy aerial attacks on the major military hubs, firebombing metropolitan areas like Tokyo and Kyoto, leaving massive swaths of the cities little more than ashes. 1/3 of the nation’s wealth was gone, spent on the war effort, or burned away in the siege. The Japanese defeat was largely a product of the American military. Though it was a coalition of Allied forces from multinational backgrounds that determined the country was to be occupied after the war, it was America that took the lead — and at the helm was General Douglas McArthur, the Supreme leader of the Allied Powers. MacArthur’s charisma and leadership style worked well with the Japanese mentality, and his enthusiasm for rebuilding was unparalleled. Building on the monumental changes brought during the Meiji restoration nearly a century before, MacArthur helped shepherd a new era. The occupation objective was more than ensuring that [Japan would not](https://www.jica.go.jp/Resource/dsp-chair/english/chair/modernization/ku57pq00002mpdct-att/modernization_chapter_03.pdf) “become a menace to the United States or to the peace and security of the world.” Using the lessons learned from WWI, the United States used the population’s disillusion with the government and desperate economic state to lay the base work of Democracy — though it elected not to force democracy, rather it aimed to support the Japanese in the creation of a new government of their choosing. [Documents outlining](https://www.history.com/news/post-wwii-us-japan-occupation-allies) the United States plan emphasized its desire for a government that conformed, “as closely as may be to the principles of democratic self-government,” but acknowledged that it was “not the responsibility of the Allied Powers to impose upon Japan any form of government not supported by the freely expressed will of the people.” Rather than humiliate Japan, the aim was to prop it up, ensure that the economy didn’t crash, and that the people didn’t grow resentful of the Allied Powers. Unlike post-war Germany, Japan was to govern itself, albeit with heavy guidance from General McArthur and the Allies. In MacArthur’s official staff reports, it stated that any involvement was to aid the Japanese by encouraging local officials and civilians to participate in the overhaul of the existing civil structure, and to prevent citizens from feeling, “the loss of self-respect and self-confidence.” A key step in this plan was to allow Emperor Hirohito to save face. With Hirohito on America’s side, President Truman asserted that the Japanese people would be more likely to cooperate with the occupation and make the transition from a nationalist imperial state to a democratic one more easily. Though Hirohito made for a valuable ally, the title of emperor was stripped of any authority and reduced to that of a figurehead. Instead, a cabinet of ministers would enact policies and head the Japanese government. To preserve morale, Hirohito never used the word “surrender” during his address to the Japanese people at the end of the war. Rather, he implied that Japan chose peace in the face of overwhelming violence from weapons like the atomic bomb. A narrative was spun accusing the military of betraying the emperor, who was cleared of all war crimes after he agreed to appoint a cabinet of advisors approved by Allied forces. The Japanese military was completely disarmed, a decision that was enshrined in the constitution’s [9th article](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html#:~:text=Article%209.,means%20of%20settling%20international%20disputes.) and is still hotly contested to this day. Military leaders were banned from the political sphere, and trials for their war crimes were held in Tokyo to punish the so-called sedition. Additionally, American forces took drastic measures to redistribute wealth in Japan. Wealthy businesses (Zaibatsu) and landowners were stripped of much of their wealth, which was redistributed from the business conglomerates that fueled the war efforts to agricultural sectors, giving land to farmers and pushing for labor reforms. Before the war, more than half of Japanese farmers were tenant farmers — they owned nothing, and produced for wealthy landowners. A new Ministry of Labor was created to pass laws on trade unions and labor relations, modeled after President Roosevelt’s New Deal. The right to vote was given to not only working-class men but also women; 38 women won the vote in the first election in 1946. Japan and the fight against the Red Menace By 1946, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was sounding the alarm in Europe. The “Iron Curtain” had descended, sowing the seeds of the eventual Cold War. Japan’s position in the Pacific made it a key actor in halting the spread of communism. The US aimed to have Japan a functioning “self-sufficient democracy, strong enough and stable enough to support itself” but simultaneously strong enough to hold the “Far East,” but by 1948, the US had run out of time. The reunification of Korea failed, splitting the country in two. The North was a hotbed of communism, and the South a fledgling democracy. By 1949, the Communist Party defeated the Nationalist Party in China, cementing [ Mao Zedong’s](https://wegotthiscovered.com/politics/why-did-china-enter-the-korean-war/) rise to power. China and the Soviet Union formed a formidable alliance, and by 1950 North Korea attacked the South, launching the Korean War, kicking off the not-so-Cold War. It was more imperative than ever for Japan to be self-sufficient. In 1951, the United States hosted a peace conference to discuss The San Francisco Treaty. The treaty proclaimed Japan an independent nation and ended any claim it might have on Korea. Additionally, it required no reparations to be paid to any nation the country had attacked during WWII — including China, which was not invited to the peace talks. [The Soviet Union](https://wegotthiscovered.com/tag/soviet-union/) opposed the treaty, but the Prime Minister of Japan, Yoshida Shigeru, accepted the conditions and officially ended the American occupation — but only on paper. Japan still had no military might and in the face of the growing threat, Shigeru tapped the United States for a security treaty. America would provide substantial military support, meaning the occupation continued. The U.S. had one condition: That Japan work on bolstering its military might, but Article 9 caused contention. After much deliberation, Japan elected to create a “security force,” a paramilitary that was established in 1954, and never changed the phrasing of Article 9. That same year, Japan reached a treaty with the Soviet Union and officially entered the UN. Japan after the Cold War Despite fears of war, Japan experienced an economic boom between the late 50s and the early 70s. As mechanization made agricultural yields plentiful, rural residents transplanted to metropolitan areas. One out of 9 people lived in Tokyo and less than 20% of the population worked in the agricultural sector — a dramatic shift from the nearly 50% just 20 years before. Though the Vietnam War strained US-Japanese relationships through the 60s, the relationship stabilized by the early 70s. By the 80s, the Japanese economy [was one of the world’s](https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/Political-developments) largest and most sophisticated. It emphasized international exports, inexplicably linking Japan to the delicacies and [ entertainment we all love](https://wegotthiscovered.com/anime/) today.

    "text": "Eastern Cape pupils to show off their robotics skills in Panama\nA pair of tech-savvy Eastern Cape teens are hoping to crack the code to success on the international stage after being selected to represent SA’s “Spring Bots” team competing at the First Global Robotics Challenge in Panama.\nAmy Brown, from Uitenhage High School, and Clyde Snyder, from Paterson High School, have been chosen as the only provincial representatives for team SA as they travel to Panama City in October to compete from October 29 to November 1.\nThe robotics challenge is an Olympics-style, international robotics competition where teams from 190 countries compete to build and program robots.\nClyde and Amy, both 14-year-old grade 9 pupils, were chosen to be part of the national team after excelling at the regional competition in May.\nAmy said she joined the school’s robotics club on a whim and quickly discovered a passion for the field.\n“My friends told me about the new robotics class and I was curious, so I joined it.\n“I am so grateful to the teachers who have taught me so much about technology and robotics.\n“I am excited for the trip to Panama City and to experience a new country.\n“My goal is to win the competition so that I can make my school and my country proud. I also want to encourage other young minds that anything is possible,” Amy said.\nHer teammate, Clyde, has been a part of his school’s robotics club since grade 8.\n“I enjoy learning how the robots are programmed and how they work.\n“I am proud to represent my school and my country. To prepare, I have been doing mini challenges and learning more about robotics.\n“I hope we do well and show more people that robotics is fun,” Clyde said.\nThe pair will travel to Johannesburg for two training sessions before they leave for Panama City.\nGary Hendricks, the robotics teacher at Uitenhage High School, said pupils had shown great interest in the activity.\n“Amy has shown great potential. She has earned this opportunity through her determination and willingness to learn.”\nPaterson High School principal Rose de Doncker said they had been monitoring Clyde’s progress since grade 8.\n“It is so amazing to see a child from our community achieve something so big.\n“He has become a beacon of hope for us, and we are so proud.\n“We can’t wait to see him fly high,” she said.\nThe Herald\nWould you like to comment on this article?\nRegister (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.",

Eldena Bear Don’t Walk, chair of the SKC Board of Directors, reminded students, “you carry with you not only a degree but the hopes and pride of an entire community.” Interim president Stacey Sherwin spoke about the value of resilience – “let’s face it, you all have degrees in bouncing back … it’s not about being perfect, it’s about persistence.” Faced with the setbacks that life inevitably delivers, she coached them to “laugh a little, learn a lot and lean on your friends and family when you need to.” With that skill set, she predicted, “you will be unstoppable.” “The world needs what you have,” she added. “Your ideas, your kindness, your courage and your resilience.” “Give yourself permission to root for yourself, to be proud of yourself,” advised commencement speaker JoRee LaFrance. “… We deserve to thrive in our own communities.” James Douthwaite, who earned his bachelor’s in Forest Management, was named Student of the Year.
