At least 15 fire companies responded, working quickly to successfully evacuate more than 100 people from the the building without loss of life. Some 40 people were treated on site, said Claudio Pavez, a coronel with Chile’s national police force.\nThe building was located near the Plaza the Armas, one of the most bustling central area’s of\nSantiago.\nJuan Pablo Slako, a deputy commander with the firefighters, said that there were no fatalities and no serious injuries with most suffering smoke inhalation or shock.\n“We don’t have fire in the apartments, so we ask for calm,” said Álvaro Lara, vice superintendent of the firefighters, who added that the fire was controled.",

    "text": "Elle King has rescheduled a series of shows following her controversial performance during Dolly Parton's birthday tribute at the Ryman Auditorium earlier this month.\nThe singer-songwriter and daughter of actor-comedian Rob Schneider, has faced much criticism for what some fans have called a \"lackluster\" performance.\nWhat was supposed to a family-friendly program, turned into a chaotic, \"hammered\" performance as the \"Ex's and Oh's\" singer admitted to being under the influence, not knowing the lyrics to Parton's, \"Marry Me,\" and frequently cursed throughout the evening.\n\"I'll tell you one thing more … Hi, my name is Elle King. I'm (expletive) hammered,\" she said onstage.\n\"I don't know the lyrics to these things in this (expletive) town/Don't tell Dolly 'cause it's her birthday.\" She continued. \"I'm not even gonna (expletive) lie … y'all bought tickets for this (expletive), you ain't getting your money back.\"\nKing's performance prompted an apology from the Grand Ole Opry on social media after many fans expressed their disappointment.\n\"Hi Judas, we deeply regret and apologize for the language that was used during last night’s second Opry performance,\" said the Ryman in a post to X on Jan. 20.\nNeither King or Parton have commented about the performance.\nWhat shows did Elle King reschedule? In an Instagram story , King announced a total of 5 rescheduled shows.\nKing's concerts on Feb. 23 and 24 at Island Resort and Casino in Harris, Michigan, have been moved to March 29 and 30, \"due to an unforeseen circumstance,\" according to a news release Thursday from the casino.\nOn Wednesday, Billy Bob's Texas announced that the Fort Worth show set to take place on Friday would be rescheduled to Sept. 21. The venue did not provide a reason for the last-minute cancelation.\n\"Original event tickets will be accepted for the new date. Refunds are available at the point of purchase,\" said the venue in a post to Instagram. \"Thank you for your understanding!\"\nShows in Shipshewana, Ind. and Waukegan, Ill. were also postponed.\nDiana Leyva covers trending news and service for The Tennessean.

    "text": "Attackers have been spotted exploiting two additional vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-9463, CVE-2024-9465) in Palo Alto Networks’ Expedition firewall configuration migration tool, CISA has confirmed on Thursday.\nAbout the vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-9463, CVE-2024-9465) CVE-2024-9463 allows unauthenticated attackers to run arbitrary OS commands as root on vulnerable Expedition instances, leading to disclosure of usernames, cleartext passwords, device configurations, and device API keys of PAN-OS firewalls.\nCVE-2024-9465 – an SQL injection vulnerability – allows unauthenticated attackers to grab data from Expedition’s database (password hashes, usernames, device configurations, device API keys) and to create and read arbitrary files on vulnerable Expedition systems.\nBoth vulnerabilities have been patched by Palo Alto Networks in early October 2024, alongside several other flaws .\nAmong those is CVE-2024-9464, an authenticated command injection bug that could be chained with CVE-2024-5910 (missing authentication for a critical function) – as demonstrated by Horizon3.ai researchers.\nCVE-2024-5910, a patch for which was provided by PAN in July 2024, is also being leveraged in the wild, CISA said last week. (Whether alone or in conjunction with any other flaw is currently unknown.)\nWhat to do? CISA adding CVE-2024-9463 and CVE-2024-9465 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog means that US federal civilian agencies must remediate them within three weeks.\n“Although [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01] only applies to [Federal Civilian Executive Branch] agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice,” the agency noted.\nPalo Alto Networks advises admins to:\nUpgrade Expedition installations to the latest available version Rotate Expedition usernames, passwords, and API keys Rotate firewall usernames, passwords, and API keys processed by Expedition Ensure networks access to Expedition is restricted to authorized users, hosts, or networks Shut down the software if not in use Expedition should not be exposed to the internet, and generally isn’t: Censys recently searched for reachable Expedition instances, and found only 45 of them.\nPAN firewalls under attack via unspecified zero-day RCE flaw Last week Palo Alto urged customers to appropriately configure and secure access to firewall management interfaces exposed to the internet, as they observed threat activity exploiting an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability against a limited number of them.\n“We do not have sufficient information about any indicators of compromise to share at this time. If the management interface was exposed to the Internet, we advise the customer to monitor for suspicious threat activity such as unrecognized configuration changes or users,” the company advised .\nI have read and agree to the terms & conditions Leave this field empty if you're human:",
