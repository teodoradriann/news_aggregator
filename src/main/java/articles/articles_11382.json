    "title": "\"Brilliantly well\" Micah Richards gives his reaction to Arsenal beating Spurs",
    "text": "Micah Richards shared his admiration for Arsenal’s performance in their hard-fought 2-1 victory over Tottenham last night . The Gunners, in pursuit of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table, delivered a crucial result to maintain their momentum in the title race.\nArsenal have shown steady improvement this season, and with Liverpool’s recent struggles, the Gunners had an opportunity to narrow the gap. However, they have also faced their own inconsistencies, meaning every match now carries heightened significance. The clash with Spurs was expected to provide a stern test, but Arsenal rose to the occasion, showcasing both quality and resilience.\nThe Gunners dominated large portions of the game, dictating play with energy and determination. Despite falling behind early on, they remained composed and found a way back into the contest. Their response, both tactically and mentally, proved decisive as they turned the game around to secure an important victory.\nMicah Richards, who was on punditry duty during the match, praised Arsenal’s all-around performance and highlighted the team’s improved cohesion. Speaking on BBC Live , the former Manchester City defender noted: “Spurs were passive, but you have to give credit to Arsenal – you were looking for a reaction. They had higher energy.”\nRichards also pointed out Arsenal’s transformation in their pressing game, emphasising their ability to work as a collective unit. He continued: “At times Arsenal have been a bit passive. Everyone knows where they need to be. With Arsenal when they pressed, at times they have gone by themselves, and today it was as a team. They did all the jobs brilliantly well.”\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images) This result marked one of Arsenal’s most complete performances in recent weeks, a point echoed by fans and pundits alike. The players demonstrated mental toughness by staying in the game after conceding and ensuring they controlled the majority of the match, particularly in high-pressure moments.\nArsenal’s victory over Spurs not only provides a boost in their pursuit of Liverpool but also signals their growing maturity under Mikel Arteta. The performance underlined their ability to handle challenging situations, a quality that will be vital in the final stages of the season.",

    "text": "Bangladesh's transgender hijra community have enjoyed greater legal and political recognition in recent years but still suffer from entrenched prejudice / © AFP\nKicked out of other prayer services, members of Bangladesh's transgender hijra community have been welcomed at a new mosque in the Muslim-majority nation with the promise of worship without discrimination.\nThe humble structure -- a single-room shed with walls and a roof clad in tin -- is a new community hub for the minority, who have enjoyed greater legal and political recognition in recent years but still suffer from entrenched prejudice.\n\"From now on, no one can deny a hijra from praying in our mosque,\" community leader Joyita Tonu said in a speech to the packed congregation.\n\"No one can mock us,\" added the visibly emotional 28-year-old, a white scarf covering her hair.\nThe mosque near Mymensingh, north of the capital Dhaka on the banks of the Brahmaputra river, was built on land donated by the government after the city's hijra community were expelled from an established congregation.\n\"I never dreamt I could pray at a mosque again in my lifetime,\" said Sonia, 42, who as a child loved to recite the Koran and studied at an Islamic seminary.\nHijra have been welcomed at a new mosque near Mymensingh, north of the capital Dhaka / © AFP\nBut when she came out as hijra, as transgender women in South Asia are commonly known, she was blocked from praying in a mosque.\n\"People would tell us: 'Why are you hijra people here at the mosques? You should pray at home. Don't come to the mosques,'\" Sonia, who uses only one name, told AFP.\n\"It was shameful for us, so we didn't go,\" she added. \"Now, this is our mosque. Now, no one can say no.\"\n- 'Like any other people' -\nHijra have been the beneficiaries of growing legal recognition in Bangladesh, which since 2013 has officially allowed members of the community to identify as a third gender.\nSeveral have entered Bangladeshi politics, with one transgender woman elected mayor of a rural town in 2021.\nBut hijra still struggle for basic recognition and acceptance, lacking property and marriage rights.\nThey are also often discriminated against in employment and are much more likely to be victims of violent crime and poverty than the average Bangladeshi.\nHijra still struggle for basic recognition and acceptance, lacking property and marriage rights / © AFP\nHardline Islamist groups have also lashed out at the recognition of transgender Bangladeshis in school textbooks, leading rallies to demand the government abandon its push to include them in the curriculum.\nMufti Abdur Rahman Azad, founder of a hijra charity, told AFP that the new mosque was the first of its kind in the country.\nA similar endeavour planned in another city was stopped last month after a protest by locals, he added.\nDozens of local hijra women donated time and money to build the Dakshin Char Kalibari Masjid for the Third Gender, which opened this month.\nIt also has a graveyard, after a local Muslim cemetery last year refused to bury a young hijra woman inside its grounds.\nThe mosque's imam, Abdul Motaleb, 65, said that the persecution of the hijra community was against the teachings of his faith.\n\"They are like any other people created by Allah\", the cleric told AFP.\n- 'No one can be denied' -\n\"We all are human beings. Maybe some are men, some are women, but all are human. Allah revealed the Holy Koran for all, so everyone has the right to pray, no one can be denied.\"\nThe mosque's imam, Abdul Motaleb, 65, said that the persecution of the hijra community was against the teachings of his faith / © AFP\nMotaleb said that other Bangladeshis could learn from the faith and strength of the hijra.\n\"Since I have been here at this mosque, I have been impressed by their character and deeds,\" he said.\nThe new mosque is already tackling prejudice. Local resident Tofazzal Hossain, 53, has offered Friday prayers there for a second week in a row.\nHe said living and praying with the hijra community has changed his \"misconceptions\" about them.\n\"When they started to live with us, many people said many things,\" he told AFP.\n\"But we've realised what people say isn't right. They live righteously like other Muslims\".\nTonu hopes to expand the simple mosque to be big enough to cater for more people.\n\"God willing, we will do it very soon,\" she told AFP.\n\"Hundreds of people can offer prayers together.\"",
