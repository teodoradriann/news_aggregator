You are their true teacher - beyond the bedtime stories and packed lunches - building moral principles that will mold their character. You have been sowing some powerful lessons in the rich soil of their developing minds. Here they are:\n[readmore](javascript://)\n02/8You get to choose your friend\nRemember when your little one came home upset because a playmate wasn't playing fair? You seized that moment to whisper a life-changing truth into their ear – \"You get to choose your friends.\" It's a lesson that extends beyond the playground. As they grow, they will carry this wisdom, making decisions about the company they keep. Friendship, you tell them, is a garden that should be tended with care.\nRead also:\nBaby names inspired by cute and beautiful animals [readmore](javascript://)\n03/8You have the right to say yes or no\nIt started with them refusing to eat broccoli, and you respected that 'no.' Little did you know, you were planting a seed of self-assertion. You are teaching them that their voice matters, that it's okay to decline things that don't align with their values. This lesson grows with them - from sharing toys to setting boundaries in relationships.\n[readmore](javascript://)\n04/8You are loved and appreciated\nIn the quiet moments, you looked into their eyes and said, \"I love you.\" In those moments, you have given them a lifelong truth – they are loved and appreciated. Your affection becomes the anchor they will cling to during stormy teenage years and turbulent adulthood. The power of unconditional love is a gift that keeps on giving.\n[readmore](javascript://)\n05/8You have the right to dislike someone\nWhen they wrinkled their nose at a relative, you didn't dismiss it. Instead, you acknowledged their feelings, telling them it's okay not to like everyone. You are teaching them to trust their instincts, to understand that personal preferences are valid. This lesson becomes their shield against toxic relationships and a reminder that self-respect is non-negotiable.\nRead also:\nDad Time: 6 reasons why spending quality time with father is a must for children [readmore](javascript://)\n06/8Ask a lot of questions\n\"Why? What? How?\" - your child's relentless curiosity is a treasure chest of wisdom waiting to be opened. By encouraging them to ask questions, you are nurturing a thirst for knowledge. It's more than just quenching their curiosity; it's about building the confidence to seek answers, creating a mindset that makes learning as a lifelong adventure.\n[readmore](javascript://)\n07/8Never forget who you are\nYou have whispered to them in your quiet times of introspection, \"Never forget who you are.\" It's not just a catchphrase related to Disney movies. You are helping them to develop a sense of self by encouraging them to stay loyal to who they are in spite of social pressures. This lesson serves as their compass, pointing them in the direction of their true selves as they make their way through life's maze.\n[readmore](javascript://)\n08/8Dream big and work hard\nYou tell them tales of your lofty goals and laborious efforts as you tuck them into bed. You are planting the seeds of ambition in them, showing them that goals are attainable with enough work and dedication. Every bedtime story turns into a lesson. You are the unsung hero in their tale, so keep imparting knowledge and giving them power.\n[readmore](javascript://)\nTRENDING ARTICLES\n2000-year-old Chinese concept that can make you successful Life lessons to empower kids for happiness COVID may cause brain injury Most amazing statues and sculptures in the world Temples in India where men are not allowed Most weird and unique trains from across the world What happens when magnesium is low in the body?

    "text": "Cheetham Hill Construction (CHC) transitioned to an employee ownership trust (EOT) on 1st August 2025, with 100% of the shares owned by the 100 or so employees.\nThe transition fulfils the long-standing ambition of founder and managing director Howard Chamberlain, who has led the company for the past 59 years.\nHoward Chamberlain set up the business as a limited company in 1966 when he was just 20 years old. In 2016 ownership passed to his daughters, Claire Chamberlain and Katie Myers, who are both directors of CHC alongside their father.\nHoward Chamberlain will remain a director under the new ownership model although Mike Goodier, previously contracts director, has now taken over as managing director.\nCHC is expecting to hit £25m turnover for this year, which is an increase of more than 30% on the previous filed accounts, as delayed projects and frameworks are now in full flow, the company said.\nGot a story?
