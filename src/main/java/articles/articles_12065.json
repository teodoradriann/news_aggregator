    "text": "Trending:\nCongo Man Dies of Hemorrhagic Fever, Indicating Another Mystery Outbreak\nA man with hemorrhagic fever symptoms in western Congo died, leading to the suspicion that a virus, which has remained unidentified for more than three weeks now, might have played a role alongside malaria in a mysterious outbreak that claimed dozens of lives in the country.\nLast week authorities in Congo said they suspected malaria in the disease outbreak signs of which are just like the flu\nA man has died in western Congo with symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, leading officials to suspect that a still-unidentified virus may be involved alongside malaria in a mysterious outbreak that killed over 100 people, according to health authorities.\nLast week authorities in Congo said they suspected malaria in the disease outbreak, signs of which are just like the flu, as more than four out of five patients have tested for the vector-borne disease. However, the new fatality due to hemorrhagic fever, which is not associated with parasite-caused malaria, could indicate another virus alongside as well.\nHemorrhagic fevers are a group of illnesses caused by viruses that damage your blood vessels and can cause severe bleeding. Some fever viruses also lead to symptoms like body aches and fatigue—like Ebola, dengue, Marburg, and yellow fever. According to experts, these viruses are most common in parts of Africa, Asia, and South America.\nHemorrhagic fever victim died at the same place where the malaria outbreak was reported\nAccording to the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the man died in the remote Panzi area of Kwango province, where the outbreak has been recorded. Sgashi Ngongo, an official with ACDCP, told reporters that this has led to a working hypothesis that the outbreak is either “severe malaria on a background of malnutrition” or “a viral infection that is happening on the background of malaria.”\nAuthorities said that based on the first diagnostics, they think it is a respiratory disease, adding that further laboratory results are awaited.\nOfficials say that even though hemorrhagic fever is reported for the first time, malaria is endemic in the Panzi area, marred with high levels of malnutrition, complicating the diagnosis of the latest outbreak.\nAre hemorrhagic fevers dangerous?\nAccording to experts, the viruses in this group range in severity. Many of them cause mild illness. But all of them can damage your blood vessels and interfere with your blood’s ability to clot, leading to life-threatening complications.\nA few signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic fever include:\n- Fever\n- Body aches\n- Dizziness\n- Fatigue and extreme tiredness\n- Headaches\n- Rashes all over the body\n- Bleeding from your nose, eyes, gums or vagina\n- Severe vomiting—sometimes even blood\n- Breathlessness\n- Low blood pressure\n- Seizures\n- Coma\nWhat causes hemorrhagic fever?\nWhile it is not fully understood how hemorrhagic fever viruses cause severe bleeding, studies show that the viruses damage your blood vessels, causing them to leak and also interfere with blood clotting. Several types of viruses can cause viral hemorrhagic fevers, including:\n- Arenaviruses\n- Filoviruses\n- Bunyaviruses\n- Flaviviruses\n- Mosquito bites\n- Tick bites\n- Contact with body fluids like blood, pee, poop, or saliva\n- Contact with the body fluids of an infected animal\nGet\n[Latest News](https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news)Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from[Health](https://www.timesnownews.com/health)and around the world.Trending:\nAshima Sharda Mahindra author\nIs a prolific writer with a varied experience of over two decades of journalism under her belt.

    "title": "Will the Northern Lights be visible in Central Texas Thursday night?",
    "text": "WACO, Texas — Space enthusiasts, plan to look up at the night sky on Thursday night! Plenty of Americans will once again have another chance to witness the aurora borealis, or the Northern Lights. Turns out, a coronal mass ejection from the Sun occurred on Tuesday. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) anticipates it will strike Earth's atmosphere Thursday night and only last 12 hours long. What causes aurora borealis? Earth has a protective magnetic field. When coronal mass injections interact with Earth's magnetic field, it causes geomagnetic storms, according to NOAA. These storms then create displays of aurora borealis, a dazzling light show of green to red to even purple and pink across the sky. NOAA anticipates it will be as spectacular as the May aurora borealis, meaning it will be a light show that's worth seeing. Who will have the best view of the Northern Lights? Those living in northern states have a higher likelihood of seeing the dazzling show. See the map below for the states impacted. Will Central Texans see the aurora borealis? According to our Chief Meteorologist Matt Farrell, the Waco area may be able to view the solar event under special circumstances. \"If you own a good camera and can make it to a dark area far away from city lights, you MAY just be able to get a glimpse of the Northern Lights in photographic form tonight, as far south as Dallas and Waco,\" he said on his Facebook page . In other words, if you are in an area where there's no light pollution near Waco, you may be able to witness the event on your camera or cell phone and not by the naked eye. Instead, the aurora borealis may be viewable to the naked eye in the northern Panhandle and Amarillo. Below are some tips to help your chances of viewing the event: What's the best time to catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights? The best time to view the Northern Lights is between 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. How can you take a picture of the Northern Lights? You can best capture your photo with low shutter speeds and night mode, especially if you are on your smartphone. If I miss it, can I see it again? Farrell said there will be plenty of chances to see the Northern Lights, even in Texas. That's because the Sun is approaching its solar maximum cycle, which is the sun's most energetic phase every 11 years. \"We expect these situations to continue through next July,\" he said.",

    "text": "The Cincinnati Bengals and Kansas City Chiefs have beef fueled by high-stakes battles in a split of the last two AFC championship games.\nThe 2023 stakes are muted thanks to Joe Burrow's season-ending wrist injury. But that's not stopping Ja'Marr Chase from adding \"fire to the fuel\" ahead of Sunday's game. The All-Pro Bengals receiver went out of his way on Thursday to take shots at the Kansas City defense.\n\"I know what I see on paper. I know what I see in game,\" Chase told reporters of the Chiefs defense. \"That's why they double everybody. 'Cause they can't do it one on one.\n\"The best player on their team is [cornerback L'Jarius] Sneed. That's a fact. Everybody knows that. That's why they double everything they see. ... They know I'm good. They know how to play us. It's not like they've got a superstar on their defense.\"\nJa’Marr Chase didn’t back track at all when asked about his assessment of Chiefs defense. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care. … I’m not Ironman. I can’t throw the ball to myself. It’s a team sport.” pic.twitter.com/KmnaKIcLYe\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags) December 28, 2023 Neither Sneed nor Chase are sure to play on Sunday. Sneed's been sidelined at practice this week with a calf strain. Chase has been limited by a lingering shoulder injury that sidelined him last week. But he sounds ready to challenge the Kansas City secondary if he can go with no concern for providing bulletin-board material.\n\"I'm just adding fire to the fuel right now,\" Chase continued. \"They're gonna take this, run with it. Hope they put it in their locker.\"\nAt 9-6, this is not a vintage Chiefs team. They're seeking to clinch the AFC West on Sunday after blowing an opportunity to do so in a stunning Christmas Day loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. But their defense is excellent. Kansas City enters Week 17 ranked second in total defense and third against the pass. Chase is poking a quite capable bear.\nHe also has the receipts to back up his talk. Chase has made the Pro Bowl in each of his two NFL seasons and posted a career game with 266 yards and three touchdowns in 2021 against Kansas City. The 8-7 Bengals will need him Sunday as they fight to keep their dwindling playoff hopes alive.",

The team engaged with local artists and cultural professionals, toured the Han Culture Centre Malaysia, and visited Xiamen University Malaysia (XMUM). To round out their experience, they joined local students for a Chinese language class at the China Cultural Centre in Kuala Lumpur.\nA Malay proverb states, \"Tak kenal maka tak cinta,\" meaning \"You can't love what you don't know.\" This wisdom underscores the importance of cultural understanding.\nThe deepening friendship between China and Malaysia is rooted in the interweaving of languages, arts, literature and education. As the BRI continues to promote bilateral cultural exchanges, both nations are poised not only to reap mutual benefits but also to contribute significantly to global prosperity and development.\n(Web editor: Hongyu, Wu Chengliang)",

    "text": "FRESNO, Calif. -- Moving away for college is always an exciting new chapter. It can also be filled with anxiety and sometimes it can be lonely. \"My roommate didn't move in until the day before classes started,\" said Madelynn Moreno, a third-year and Psychology Major at Fresno State. \"I was there a couple of days by myself and I was really lonely then.\" Feelings that Moreno dealt with when she moved into the dorms at Fresno State when she was a freshman. To fight the feeling of loneliness, she went somewhere that felt comforting. \"I needed something that felt some form of familiarity,\" said Moreno. \"I went to Target. I walked around Target for a little while and called my dad.\" Now as a third-year psychology major, Moreno has found her community on campus. Through the Peer Ambassador of Wellness program, or PAW, which helps promote student health and well-being on campus. \"It's a good opportunity to help connect students with resources that they need for different health reasons,\" said Moreno. \"We push events that we have going on.\" Staff at Fresno State says this year's group of transfer and freshmen students is one of their biggest. Etisha Wilbon, the Director of Counseling and Psychological Services at Fresno State, tells Action News they're seeing an increase in students experiencing loneliness. \"We also have to account for these are also the individuals that experienced the hybrid and the school from home during COVID,\" said Wilbon. \"So a lot of them are having issues socializing, which could really be a trigger for loneliness.\" That's why Fresno State offers a variety of resources from outreach programs to counseling. \"There are workshops, psycho-education, processing groups, and a lot of them are about building community,\" said Wilbon. \"Talking about current events, talking about depression in a very candid way because experiencing that can be a very lonely process.\" Both Moreno and Wilbon say loneliness doesn't have to be a fight you have on your own. \"A million people have felt the way that you do, and a million people will feel the way that you do,\" said Moreno. \"Looking for people to talk to about that is one of the best pieces of advice I can give.\" This story is part of the \"Our America: Mental State - The Loneliness Epidemic\" series.

    "text": "Siga aqui o nosso liveblog sobre o conflito entre Israel e o Hamas Uma jovem que durante meses esteve refém do Hamas na Faixa de Gaza anunciou que se vai juntar as Forças de Defesa de Israel. Aos 18 anos, Noga Weiss revelou que sempre foi seu desejo alistar-se no exército e que com esta decisão encontrou uma forma de “seguir em frente com a sua vida”. “Sempre quis alistar-me e dedicar-me ao meu país. O exército significa, para mim, uma combinação de uma distração face ao que aconteceu, uma estrutura e uma rotina diária, mas principalmente significa avançar com a minha vida da forma como teria sido antes de tudo isto acontecer“, sublinhou a jovem, citada pelo Times of Israel . [UNICEF alerta sobre “riscos catastróficos” para 600 mil crianças em Rafah] Segundo o mesmo jornal, no exército a jovem vai assumir uma função conhecida como mashakit tash. “Cuidar do indivíduo é uma das principais funções da equipa tash. Semelhante ao trabalho de um assistente social, os membros do tash estão disponíveis para resolver problemas de diferentes categorias, como questões financeiras, familiares”, pode ler no site de uma unidade israelita. “[Os seus elementos] devem ter a capacidade de ser sensíveis, de ser generosos e de ter amor pela humanidade. Este trabalho permite uma grande variedade de caminhos de desenvolvimento, desde orientação até comando”, acrescenta. Para Noga Weiss, juntar-se a esta unidade é a “decisão certa” depois de um “período muito turbulento”. “A posição de mashakit tash é um sonho com vários anos. Sinto que posso contribuir muito e ajudar os outros”, afirmou. [Israel anuncia eliminação de célula do Hamas e morte de quatro pessoas] A jovem lembrou o momento em que juntamente com a mãe foi libertada pelo Hamas, sendo recebida na passagem de Kerem Shalom pelas forças israelitas. “A presença dos soldados fez-me sentir segura e só fortalece o meu desejo de ser parte do exército e servir nele”, acrescentou.",
