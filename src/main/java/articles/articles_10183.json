The video then shows a figure, identified as a Russian soldier, approaching and checking the fallen men.\n“This represents yet another egregious violation of international humanitarian law in the treatment of prisoners of war by the aggressor country,” said the prosecutor's office when announcing its investigation on Wednesday.\nEarlier on December 3, Ukraine accused Russia of a war crime after another video emerged showing several soldiers shooting two surrendering personnel emerging from a dugout.\nIn a notable incident last March, a video captured the execution of a captured Ukrainian soldier after he declared “Glory to Ukraine\", a phrase emblematic of Ukrainian resistance since the war's onset.\nUkraine's Zelenskyy Discusses Peace Formula with Pope Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed on Thursday that he had a discussion with Pope Francis about Ukraine's proposed peace formula.\nMr Zelenskyy mentioned in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, about the collaboration to implement Ukraine's Peace Formula.\nHe said more than 80 countries are participating at the representative level, with expectations of further involvement.\nI just had a call with @Pontifex Pope Francis.\nI expressed my gratitude to His Holiness for his Christmas greetings to Ukraine and Ukrainians, as well as his wishes for a just peace for all of us.\nWe discussed our joint work to put Ukraine’s Peace Formula into action.

Niente da fare per la Tennis ta verucchiese nello scontro con la numero due del mondo al secondo turno degli Us Open . Un sorteggio piuttosto sfortunato aveva posizionato Lucia nella parte bassa del tabellone, pronta a incrociare la racchetta con la bielorussa dopo il primo turno vinto con Lulu Sun. Un tonico che ci voleva, quel 6-3 con la neozelandese, che poi per un infortunio allâ€™anca aveva lasciato campo libero. Poca fatica anche per Sabalenka nella sua prima gara sul cemento newyorkese, come dimostra il 6-3, 6-3 in scioltezza sulla Hon. Poi lo scontro diretto, andato in scena sul secondo campo per importanza dello slam americano, il Louis Armstrong. Equilibrio fino al 3-2 Sabalenka , con servizio per Bronzetti e due possibilitÃ di impattare sul 40-15.

    "text": "Don’t Miss Those Sweet Moments\n“But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love;\nfor you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.”Psalm 59:16\nOnce my morning caregivers (I call them my “get-up girls”) have me dressed and sitting up, once I’ve finished breakfast and am ready to head out the door, my friends and I take an important pause. We head for our favorite warm spot—the bay window seat in my bedroom, which looks out over my backyard and the San Gabriel Mountains beyond. It’s one warm spot that invites sitting and lingering. In that cozy corner, the three of us open a hymnbook to harmonize together over some beautiful old hymns.\nSafeguarding a quiet moment, admiring God’s creation, and giving\nGod pleasure each morning with our song warm the soul as well as the body. Don’t be in such a hurry with life that you rush past those warm, quiet places where you meet with the Lord. The peace and perspective that come from those few sweet moments will color the rest of your day.\nFather, the Bible tells how you met with Adam and Eve in the Garden, in the cool of the day. (Genesis 3:8). I imagine there were warm, quiet places in Eden where you loved to talk to our first parents. Help me to find those moments in my day. Please don’t let me hurry past places and times where you seek fellowship with me.\nLiving in God’s Love: A Call to Christian Community\nKay Toombs, a Christian, professor, and author who lives with disability, returns to the podcast to explore the transformational power of intentional Christian community. Over decades living with multiple sclerosis (MS), Kay has reflected and taught on issues related to illness, disability, caregiving, and healing, as well as the role Christianity can play in creating a sustainable culture and caring communities.",
