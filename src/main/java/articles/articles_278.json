    "text": "[Pediatricz Now](https://pediatricznow.com/)provides comprehensive health care to children and teens from birth to 21 years of age in the Houston area. The Pediatricz Now facilities are state of the art facilities that have a full separation of well and sick to include a fully separated ventilation system which allows them the ability to provide comprehensive quality care and same-day sick and well visits. These are the key points to what sets Pediatricz Now apart from other practices. President and CEO Dr. Muhamad Almouie said most pediatric practices limit offerings to a general exam and basic testing and send families to a hospital for additional appointments. Dr. Almouie said this is inconvenient, especially for families with multiple children, and wanted to offer a better experience. “We try to provide everything they need without going to the hospital,” Dr. Almouie said. Services Pediatricz Now [provides](https://pediatricznow.com/services/): - a full range of lab services, including blood testing, urine testing and allergy testing - well exams and sports physicals - a full immunization clinic, including COVID-19 vaccines - mental health services - ADHD and Autism screening - care for acne and other skin disorders - nutrition and weight management “We make every effort to provide the testing, evaluation, treatment and whatever is needed for those patients,” Dr. Almouie said. “They can be tested and treated within 24 to 48 hours. With some practices, this can take months.” Pediatricz Now provides its high-quality care in a welcoming environment. Dr. Almouie said it’s important to have a welcoming staff and space to make children and their families feel comfortable at the doctor. “We made an effort to have the right staff: [people who are] kind, compassionate, smart, friendly and respectful, because those families need every attention possible,” Dr. Almouie said. The office at Pediatricz Now is ocean-themed with colorful murals on the walls. “We added extra features in the office to make it less intimidating and more inviting for the kids,” Dr. Almouie said. Pediatricz Now aims to adapt and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in pediatric care. “Over the years, we never stopped in one place,” Dr. Almouie said. “We’ve always adapted to what's happening in the field to provide the latest care available for any condition or patient right away.” One thing Pediatricz Now has maintained is its commitment to providing same-day care. Dr. Almouie said at most pediatric clinics, it can take three to five days to get an appointment. “We made a commitment: if they call us today, they will be seen today,” Dr. Almouie said. The priority of providing high-quality pediatric care quickly has made Pediatricz Now a trusted clinic in the Houston area. “We are totally committed to providing the best quality care to our children,” Dr. Almouie said. “I want [parents] to feel assured that they can trust coming to us.” Pediatricz Now has multiple locations throughout Houston. The Cypress location is at 17817 FM 529, Ste. 109. To make an appointment with Pediatricz Now, visit [the website](https://pediatricznow.com/)or call 888-995-7339.

    "title": "In his latest book, Calvin Trillin reflects on a colorful career – The Forward",
    "text": "Culture Writers beware: Reading this journalist’s reflections on life may cause extreme jealousy Calvin Trillin is a literary hyphenate. During a career that’s spanned over six decades, he’s written over 30 books and numerous essays and long-form journalism pieces, not to mention his humor columns and doggerel political poetry. Especially annoying to us mere mortals, he does it all exceedingly well, with rare grace, finesse and an eye for the tiniest of detail. His latest book —The Lede: Dispatches From a Life in the Press — is a collection of pieces that bear some relationship to journalism. As he notes in his introduction, he was fortunate to have “the freedom to write about what engaged me.” Here you’ll find profiles of John Irving Bloom, a respected Dallas film critic, who took on the persona of Joe Bob Briggs to review drive-in movies. The collection also includes moving tributes to departed journalists such as Morley Safer, Murray Kempton and Russell Baker. Trillin goes out in search of the best BBQ in Texas and discusses the history of his relationship with The Nation. (More on that later.) For me, this excerpt from a 2003 profile of New York Times journalist R.W. Apple encapsulates Trillin’s style and skills: “Apple famously sees to his early morning tasks … while ensconced in one of the brightly striped night shirts made for him by Harvie & Hudson, of Jermyn Street, the same firm that makes his dress shirts, so that a house guest not yet fully recovered from a late night at the Apple table can be startled by the impression that a particularly festive party tent had somehow found its way indoors.” In just one sentence, we learn that Apple is something of a dandy, a little taken with himself, and overweight — and Trillin communicates these details with a seemingly effortless, almost poetic flair that captures the essence of his subject far better than a camera. We even discover who makes Apple’s pajamas. Trillin’s career began in Kansas City, Missouri. Unlike many Jews from Eastern Europe, Calvin’s paternal grandfather landed in Galveston, not New York City. While Trillin initially believed this decision had to do with the “stubbornness” for which his family was “still renowned,” he eventually learned that his grandfather was a beneficiary of the Galveston Movement. Bankrolled by prosperous American Jews such as Jacob Schiff, the Galveston Movement was an attempt to move impoverished Eastern European immigrant Jews out of New York City, where they were a potential embarrassment to their more established brethren. The discovery sparked an article Trillin wrote for the inaugural issue of Moment magazine, which posed a burning question: “Who is Jacob Schiff that he should be embarrassed by my Uncle Ben Novsky?” In any event, the family settled first in St. Jo, Texas, before moving to Kansas City. Calvin’s father, Abe, who was just 2 years old when he arrived in this country, was less concerned with Calvin being a Jew than being an American. “He wanted me to be president of the United States,” Trillin writes. “His fallback position was that I not become a ward of the court.” The family was largely secular, though Trillin has memories of attending Rosh Hashanah services with his father and grandfather, who would spend the trip home from synagogue arguing about the quality of the cantor. Having read a book called Stover at Yale and learned that this was the university where wealthy American industrialists sent their sons, Abe was determined that Calvin attend. Not only did Trillin get into Yale, he became chairman of the student newspaper, the Yale Daily News. Henry Luce, the founder of Time, had once held the same position, and the connection helped Trillin land a job at the magazine, where he initially covered the American South. “It was a very busy year on what was sometimes called the seg beat,” Trillin reflects in The Lede. He covered the integration battle, returned to the magazine’s New York headquarters and eventually — through a friend — met with William Shawn, the venerable New Yorker editor. Trillin was planning to return to the south to write a book about the integration of the University of Georgia, and wanted to pitch freelance stories generated from his research. Shawn was interested, but suggested Trillin write as a staff writer, a position he’s held ever since, writing features as well as what used to be called casuals (now Shouts and Murmurs). Enter the late Victor Navasky — or as Trillin referred to him, “the wily and parsimonious Victor Navasky.” Trillin had contributed a couple of pieces to Monocle, a humor magazine that Navasky ran while attending Yale Law School. When he took over the liberal Nation, he offered Trillin a humor column. What Navasky didn’t know is that writing this column was destiny for Trillin. He had been cracking jokes — some of them unwanted — since sixth grade Sunday school, when he realized that by taking on the role of class clown, he could “get lucky” and “get kicked out of class and miss the rest of the course.” While the idea of a Nation column intrigued him, the negotiations did not. Navasky offered a rate in the high two figures. Trillin’s agent countered with the low three figures. Ultimately, that is what they settled on: the very low — the lowest — three figures. As Trillin put it, in one fell swoop, Navasky transformed “The Nation from a shabby pinko sheet to a shabby pinko sheet with a humor column.” That eventually morphed into a syndicated humor column and a stint as the “Deadline Poet,” a position he still holds at the magazine. Most recently, for example he wrote: As he lumbers from trial to trial, Exuding great volumes of bile, He says, “Can’t you see: They’re picking on me.” Self-pity was always his style. But of course, man cannot live on bread and low-three-figure paydays alone. Trillin’s mainstay — and the subject of his book — is journalism. The Lede, its title, refers to the journalistic term for the introduction of a story — a sentence or paragraph designed to entice readers to continue. Trillin quotes several, including one from James Thurber, who, when an editor thought an obituary he’d written suffered from wordiness, resubmitted the story like this: “Dead. “That’s what the man was when they found him with a knife in his back at 4 p.m. in front of Riley’s saloon at the corner of 52nd and 12th streets.” Or this from crime-reporter-turned-novelist Edna Buchanan, who covered a death that occurred at Church’s, a fast food restaurant, when a customer who waited in a lengthy line only to get to the counter and discover the store was out of fried chicken. Then came fisticuffs and a shot from a security guard. Wrote Edna: “Gary Robinson died hungry.” Or this from Trillin himself: “In 1993, when The New Yorker for the first time ran a photograph of a bare breasted actress, a subscriber wrote me to express, outrage, and what happened to a magazine, once known for its elegant, understated prose. The only defense I could think of was that they were small breasts, so you could say that the tradition of understatement was still alive.” Trillin’s skills are a gift, like a Steph Curry three-pointer, an innate skill that can’t be taught. As a writer, I of course appreciate them. And I hate him. How’s that for a lede?",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Russell County, Alabama from 1901-2000 was 47.9. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Russell County, Alabama experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Russell County, Alabama history.",

    "text": "By Eric Thomas ,\n7 days ago You might believe that you're winning at the game of email, writes Eric Thomas, but there are always more messages to answer. (Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)\nAs I watched her in the seat next to me on the plane, I could tell that she was a pro. Her finger darted across the screen from right to left at a pace both impressive and frantic. Clearly, she had been on the app for years.\nSwipe. Swipe. Swipe. Swipe. Swipe.\nA quick pause to evaluate. I noticed her unblinking eyes and shallow breathing. Was she holding her breath in concentration?\nAnd then again: Swipe.\nShe was fastened to the screen with her full attention. The flight attendant could have asked her if she wanted to fly the plane, and I don’t think she would have looked up.\nWith the airplane door about to close, she knew time was running out. She would have to stop as soon as her data connection failed. That made her focus even more urgent. Five more to go. Three more to go.\nSwipe. Swipe.\nWould she win?\nYet, as the airplane door sealed shut, she knew her time was up. She could not win — not that day, and perhaps not for decades. Because she was playing the unwinnable game of email.\nIn the game of email, there is no way to win.\nFor many of us, email is equal parts professional obligation and round-the-clock computer game. It demands our full attention, making us resent it even more.\nPlease don’t tell me about your perfect email “system.” The brutal efficiency that you show by pouncing on messages as soon as they bloop into your inbox. The regime of color-coded flags that you impose on the messages you receive. The proud and puritanical discipline of having an empty inbox each day at 5 p.m. Bragging about your bespoke email game theory doesn’t hide the truth.\nEmail is a drag.\nHere’s how we know email is soul-crushing, occupational torture. When was the last time you heard someone gush about the app that they use for email? Reply: Never.\nMeanwhile, millions of people cherish Microsoft Excel — a database app! — to the point of hosting tournaments that showcase their spreadsheet formulas and buying novelty T-shirts reading, “Freak in the Sheets.” (It’s an Excel -lent joke, they would say.)\nPeople in visual arts attend conventions for their apps and party together. People lose their minds when Apple releases a new product. Artificial intelligence is drawing billions in venture capital.\nBut, email … meh.\nThe most fulfilled that I feel when working with my email is when my inbox is empty — the glorious state that I have coined, “Inbox-ification.” Your mail app is open, but all that is staring back at you is glorious empty space. Nothing to click on. No attachments to wrestle. And no reply-all needed. Spoiler alert: “Inbox-ification” never happens.\nThat’s how lame email is. The app is best when it is empty. We wouldn’t say that about a piece of writing software or a photography app or a social media program. Those apps are best when they are full, active and crackling. But I only love my email when it is a silent empty vessel.\nIn those moments of “Inbox-ification,” I get visibly angry about receiving an email. Like a leaf floating onto a freshly raked lawn, that one impertinent email sullies the two hours of banging on the keyboard with my face two inches from the screen.\nOr, maybe to you, the email appearing on your screen is like an evil space invader swooping in. If you are going to win, you must obliterate that enemy. At moments like these, we treat email as a game, just like our friend was “playing” on the plane. To delete is to simply and easily vanquish the enemy. To open an email is to bravely level up. To forward is to ask your teammate to deal with it (Thanks, Janet!).\nThe most sophisticated modern video game joystick is the keyboard. It’s true for email, along with all kinds of fantasy and sports games: The keyboard is king. Those fun video games, which send you to mystic lands with imaginary beasts, have cheat codes and elaborate keyboard flourishes. The same is true for dreary email: The other day I found a shortcut for sending an email. When I mash those keys in unison to send an email, it’s a little visceral victory. Command-Return, baby!\nEmail too has its mobile versions, just like fantasy and sports video games. However, while traditional video games allow you to fight warlocks while waiting for the bus, email catapults our often-bland work lives into every unoccupied minute. How exciting to read the agenda for the third quarter purchasing meeting on a sunny day at the bus stop!\nKids know that email is horrid. High school and college students are notoriously repulsed by email. Ask any teacher or professor. Emailing students is like leaving a note outside your child’s bedroom door, only to hear them step right over it. No matter how urgent the subject line and especially if you tell them about its importance, they can muster a way to ignore it as they eagerly Snapchat with their new friends.\nWhy would kids be excited to check their email? We explain to them how our inboxes are a swirl of unapologetic spam, unpaid bills, wordy announcements and unfinished tasks. Kids have heard us whine about this sour brew for years.\nMy generation didn’t hear much of that from our parents — because our parents didn’t have email. Like many forty-somethings, I was the first person in my family to get an email account when I arrived at college. My email address was more hieroglyphic than anything: c674141@showme.missouri.edu. Very catchy.\n(With this timing, my generation will likely spend five, six or seven decades on professional email. That is not a kind sentence. Please do not re-read it.)\nAs I logged in to my account during freshman year, a nuclear-green screen glowed back at me, hoping that a high school friend might have sent a thoughtful note or replied to my email from the day before. Even in those frontier days of email, the annoyances and spam were there. “Forward this message onto 47 of your closest friends and receive eternal happiness.”\nI should have seen the true nature of email then and there.\nBut even if I had, what would I have done? Nearly every job in 2024 involves firing off a few dozen emails each day and reading many more. We reflexively sit down each morning to sling messages — whether dull or profound — to one another.\nOnce they reach someone else’s inbox, it’s their problem.\nEric Thomas teaches visual journalism and photojournalism at the William Allen White School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.

    "text": "The SPD leader asserts that without the provision of weapons, Ukraine would face total obliteration. Just before the state elections in Thuringia and Saxony, SPD leader Saskia Esken reinforces military support for Ukraine against Russia. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is working towards a fair and sustainable peace, Esken told the Funke media group newspapers. \"As long as Putin doesn't abandon his hostile intentions towards Ukraine, peace cannot be achieved diplomatically.\" Esken connects her remarks to criticism of the co-chair of the Left Party, Sahra Wagenknecht. \"If, like Madam Wagenknecht and others, we were to cease delivering weapons to Ukraine today, the country would be conquered tomorrow and wiped off the map the day after. This would have catastrophic repercussions for security throughout Europe, which would not result in less armament and certainly not in peace.\" 11:48 PM Ukraine Braces for its Toughest Winter EverAs a result of the damage to its power and energy infrastructure caused by Russian attacks, Ukraine anticipates its harshest winter yet. \"We are facing our toughest winter ever,\" says Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Haluschtschenko during a video conference. This winter will be even more harsh than the last, as the damage from ongoing Russian attacks has progressively accumulated. The Russian army employs various weapons in coordinated attacks to inflict as much damage as possible, he says. During a warm winter, electricity consumption is approximately 18 gigawatts, whereas in a cold winter it's 19 gigawatts. Furthermore, a one-gigawatt reserve must be established, says Haluschtschenko. Russian attacks have destroyed around 9 gigawatts of capacity. 11:08 PM NATO Raises Security Level at Geilenkirchen AirbaseDue to a perceived threat, NATO heightens its security level at the airbase in Geilenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia. All non-essential staff have been sent home, according to a base spokesperson. This decision is based on intelligence information indicating a potential threat. \"This is not cause for concern and is a precautionary measure to ensure we can continue our critical operations,\" the spokesperson says. Police are present at the scene, but no further details, such as the number of deployed forces, are provided. 10:07 PM Ukraine Reports Strike on Kursk StrongholdThe Ukrainian military reports another strike against Russian troops in the Kursk region. In the afternoon, they targeted a Russian stronghold using precision-guided US bombs, according to the air force commander, Mykola Oleshchuk. \"A drone command post, a radio-electronic warfare unit, equipment, weapons, and up to 40 Russian military personnel were hit,\" Oleshchuk writes alongside a video claiming to show the attack. 9:43 PM Switzerland's Peace Summit Holds First Follow-up MeetingFollowing the peace summit in Switzerland in June, the first follow-up meeting has taken place, according to Ukraine. Representatives from over 40 countries and organizations participated in the virtual session. Additional such meetings of working groups will be scheduled. 9:08 PM Habeck: More Ukrainian Refugees Should Work in GermanyEconomy Minister Robert Habeck hopes that more Ukrainian refugees in Germany will find employment. Potential obstacles such as family-related circumstances, illness, war trauma, or childcare needs could potentially hinder employment, the Green politician told Welt TV. \"However, in general, it's better for everyone to work – it's better for the people, for their integration, and for the social system.\" Habeck is skeptical of statements like those made by Brandenburg's Minister President and SPD politician Dietmar Woidke, who questioned the allowance for Ukrainian refugees. \"I believe that's due to the somewhat rough eastern German election campaigns and hasn't been thought through completely.\" 8:28 PM Brigade Launches Counteroffensive in Kharkiv Region: Two Kilometers AdvancedThe Ukrainian military has announced a push in the Kharkiv region. Troops have advanced nearly two kilometers into the frontline area, according to the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian ground forces. The primary goal of the operation was to weaken the offensive capability of the 20th Army of the Russian Federation, which the Ukrainian military claims has been achieved. This cannot be independently verified. The brigade also reports that the Russian side has lost 300 soldiers in the last four days, and a substantial amount of equipment and weapons have been destroyed or damaged. The extent of the reported counterattack remains unclear. 8:00 PM Intelligence Service Allegedly Interferes with Russian TV BroadcastThe Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) is said to have interrupted the broadcast of several Russian TV channels and replaced it with a video about the war in Ukraine. \"HUR has hacked Russian television and shown the reality of the war [to the population],\" a source at the intelligence service told the \"Kyiv Post\" newspaper and the RBC Ukraine news agency. The inserted video was shown three times during prime time yesterday evening. Channels affected included Pervouralsk, Evraziya 360, and Pervyj Kanal TV. As a result of the attack, nine channels temporarily suspended their programming, it was reported. There's been a decrease in the number of Russian ground troops situated in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave located between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, according to Lithuanian armed forces commander Raimundas Vaikšnoras, sharing this info with news portal \"Delfi\". He links this reduction to the Ukrainian offensive in the Russian region of Kursk. Upon the start of the conflict with Ukraine, noticeable relocations of equipment and troops from Kaliningrad were observed, the commander mentions. After the completion of rotations, soldiers have returned, but there's now a reduction, particularly in ground troops. 18:40 \"Armenians? Who needs them?\" – Lukashenko sparks furyBelarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko's controversial remarks about Armenia have sparked outrage. Monday evening, protestors reportedly hurled eggs at the Belarusian embassy in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, demanding the expulsion of the ambassador, as suggested by Ukrainian media sources. Prior to this, Lukashenko voiced his disapproval of Armenia's pro-Western course on Russian state television, saying \"Who needs Armenians? No one. Let them develop their economy and rely on their own resources. What is France? Who is Macron? Tomorrow, when Macron is gone, everyone will forget the Armenians,\" referring to the French president. Tensions between Armenia and its long-term ally, Russia, have been escalating since Azerbaijan seized the Nagorno-Karabakh region in a military operation in September, ending three decades of Armenian separatist rule. 18:03 Ukraine reports fatalities from glide bomb attackTwo individuals were reported killed in Sumy region bordering Russia's Kursk region due to an attack using two glide bombs, according to Ukraine's prosecutor's office. The Russian bombs were targeted at infrastructure components. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had visited Sumy earlier on Thursday, stating that attacks on the city had decreased following the capture of parts of Kursk. 17:28 Russian authorities: Oil tanker catches fire after Ukrainian attackA fuel tanker is engulfed in flames in the Russian port of Kavkaz in Krasnodar region, eastern to Crimea, Russian authorities claim. They attribute the incident to a Ukrainian attack. Various Russian media outlets distribute pictures and videos showing the inferno and smoke plumes. Ukrainian military also shares such media on social platforms, stating \"Neptune pays a visit to the port of Kavkaz.\" Unverified reports from Russian Telegram channels suggest that the ship was hit by a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missile, although the weapon's official range is 300 kilometers, and the frontline is farther away. Moscow uses the port extensively to supply its troops engaged in the war against Ukraine. 18:39 Update: The ship is reported to have sank following the fire. It had 30 fuel tanks onboard. 16:41 Russia declares victory near Pokrovsk, Ukraine reports successes in KurskRussian troops claim to have captured another village near Pokrovsk city in eastern Ukraine, moving 10 kilometers close to an important logistics hub. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had earlier announced plans to fortify troops in Pokrovsk region. Meanwhile, he reported Ukrainian victories in the Russian region of Kursk, stating that another village was conquered and \"the exchange fund\" – captured soldiers – was increased. As per the claims, Ukrainian forces now control 94 villages and over a thousand square kilometers of land in Kursk. However, these claims are yet to be verified. 16:12 Ukraine denies attempted nuclear power plant assault: Russia may itself carry out \"nuclear provocation\" Ukraine refutes the claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukrainian troops attempted to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant last night. \"This is an absolute lie,\" states Andrii Kovalenko, head of the department for countering disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. Russia has previously spread false information about Ukrainian preparation for a \"nuclear provocation\" at the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. However, all signs suggest that Russia might be planning this provocation, Kovalenko continues. He considers the \"possibility of a nuclear provocation by Russia\" to be genuine, owing to Putin's active involvement. 15:46 EU gas storage nearly full Two months ahead of the deadline, gas storage facilities in the European Union are nearly 90% full. The EU proclaims itself \"prepared for the upcoming winter,\" as declared by the European Commission. Following the start of Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, the 27 EU countries agreed in the summer of 2022 that gas storage in the EU should be at an average of 90% full by November 1. According to data from the Gas Infrastructure Europe portal, there are variations between countries: the highest level is in Spain at 100%, and the lowest is in Latvia at around 69%. In Germany, storage is 93.6% full. The EU aims to further reduce its dependency on Russian natural gas. Instead, it is importing more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US and natural gas from Norway. 15:21 Putin: Ukraine attacked Russian nuclear power plant Russian President Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of attacking the Kursk nuclear power plant. \"The opposing forces attempted to attack the nuclear power plant last night,\" says Putin without offering any evidence. \"The International Atomic Energy Agency has been informed,\" Putin adds the statement during a cabinet meeting broadcast on television. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had earlier expressed concerns about the potential impacts of fighting on the power plant and urged \"all parties to maintain maximum restraint.\" Read more here. 14:50 IAEA Chief to Visit Controversial Kursk Nuclear Plant The leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, is set to visit the disputed Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia next week. This visit has been confirmed by an IAEA spokesperson, stating it will take place \"next week.\" In early August, the Ukrainian military launched an unexpected large-scale attack on the Russian region of Kursk. The Russian nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom, then issued warnings about a potential threat to the nuclear power plant due to Ukrainian aggression, which is situated roughly 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. 14:21 Russia: 115,000 Residents Fled Threatened Regions 115,000 people have been evacuated from endangered regions along the Ukrainian border in Russia, as reported by Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov. He discusses the assessment of agricultural and industrial damage caused by the Ukrainian offensive during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin and other top officials. \"I've gathered you here to discuss the current circumstances in Russia's border regions,\" Putin says at the beginning of the meeting. 14:00 Tusk Persuaded by India's Potential Role in Ukraine Peace Talks Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk is optimistic about India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's potential role in mediating the Ukraine conflict. \"I'm delighted that the Prime Minister has shown a readiness to personally work towards a peaceful, fair, and swift resolution to the war,\" Tusk said in Warsaw after meeting with Modi. Modi's offer to mediate is important as he will be traveling to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who does not support Western sanctions against Russia.

The state-owned Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne reports this, citing intelligence sources. According to these sources, a MiG-31K supersonic interceptor and two Il-76 strategic airlifters were destroyed, and about five aircraft, likely MiG-31K/I, were damaged in an attack on August 16. A fuel depot was hit in an August 13 attack, and another MiG-31K/I was damaged. 13:06 Investigation into CNN Journalists by Russian Intelligence The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) has initiated criminal investigations against several foreign journalists, including a CNN reporter and two Ukrainian journalists, for reporting in the Russian-controlled region of Kursk. The FSB claims the journalists illegally crossed the state border to film in Ukrainian-controlled Sudja, and FSB plans to issue international arrest warrants soon. The journalists face up to five years in Russian prison for crossing the border and reporting in an unauthorized area. Recently, American journalist Evan Gershkovich was released from Russian custody as part of a prisoner exchange after being sentenced to 16 years in a labor camp for alleged spying. Read more here. 12:34 Zelenskyy in Border Region: Fund for Prisoner Exchange Reinforced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Sumy border region in northeastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops have advanced into Russia for over two weeks. He announced the capture of another town in the Kursk region and the replenishment of the \"exchange fund,\" which refers to the capture of Russian soldiers for future prisoner exchanges with those held by Russia. Zelenskyy mentioned that attacks on Sumy and civilian casualties in the area have decreased since the Kursk offensive. He posted a video of him with the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, who informed him about reinforcements in eastern Ukraine, where Russia continues to advance. 12:06 Possible Russian Spying with Drones Near Critical Infrastructure in Germany? Alleged Russian drones have been reported over the largest industrial park in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. This is reported by the \"Bild\" newspaper. In recent days, strange drones have been sighted flying at high speeds over the decommissioned nuclear power plant and the LNG terminal in Brunsbüttel. The Public Prosecutor's Office in Flensburg is investigating on suspicion of espionage with the aim of sabotage. Internally, sources indicate that the no-fly zone over the nuclear power plant was repeatedly violated, and an enemy object, suspected to be a military drone, was detected. As \"Bild\" further reports, the drones are believed to be operated by Russian agents and might have been launched from civilian ships in the North Sea. Read more here. 11:40 US Embassy in Kyiv Warns of Imminent AirstrikesThe American Embassy in Kyiv issues a warning of an elevated risk of aerial assaults prior to Ukraine's Independence Day on Saturday. In the upcoming days and during the weekend, there's a heightened probability of Russia launching strikes on Ukraine utilizing drones and missiles, as mentioned on their website. Ukraine commemorates its 33rd year of independence from the Soviet Union on August 24. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine over two and a half years ago, this celebration has gained more significance for the Ukrainians. Lately, Ukrainian soldiers unexpectedly crossed into Russian territory in the Kursk border region. Russian President Vladimir Putin labelled it as provocation and threatened retaliation. 11:13 Fire at Military Base in VolgogradFlames erupt at a military facility situated near Marinovka in the southern Russian territory of Volgograd. The populace reports blasts. Authorities in the region attribute the fire to a Ukrainian drone attack. No casualties have been reported. 10:41 Kursk Now Depends on Prefabricated Shelters from RussiaAs reported by local authorities, prefabricated secure shelters are being established for inhabitants in the Russian border region of Kursk. \"At my directive, the Kursk city administration has pinpointed central locations for the deployment of modular prefabricated shelters,\" explains regional governor Alexei Smirnov on Telegram. Shelters are being constructed at high-traffic areas, such as 60 bus stops. Smirnov shares a photograph of a truck transporting one of the modules. Shelters are also being set up in two other sites, including Kursk, where the Kursk region's nuclear power plant resides. Russia alleges that Ukraine intends to attack the facility, which Ukraine denies. 10:10 Ukraine Reports Continuous Advance in KurskUkraine divulges more than 40 assaults by Russian forces near the city of Pokrovsk. The vast majority of them were thwarted. President Zelensky guarantees reinforcements for the troops in the area. Furthermore, the progress in the Kursk region persists. 09:42 Russian Regions Under Attack by Ukrainian DronesBased on official declarations, the Russian military is repelling multiple Ukrainian aerial assaults in the western part of the nation. As explained by the Governor of Volgograd region, Andrei Bocharov, on Telegram, \"Most drones were destroyed\" near the village of Marinovka (see entry at 07:30). In the border region of Kursk, Governor Alexei Smirnov reports that \"Two Ukrainian missiles and a drone were neutralized by Russian air defense.\" In the more southern region of Rostov, Governor Vasily Golubev declares that an attack using five drones was \"Repelled.\" Drones are also reported to have been destroyed in the Russian regions of Voronezh and Bryansk. 09:09 Kyiv Seeks US Approval for Long-range Weapons against Russian TargetsUkrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov meets in Kyiv with a bipartisan delegation from the US House of Representatives. According to the ministry in Kyiv, Republican Representative Rob Wittman and Democratic Representative David Trone discuss the situation at the front and Washington's policy on the use of long-range weapons against Russian targets with Umerov. \"I emphasized that we should immediately receive permission from our allies to fully utilize long-range weapons against targets in Russia,\" said Umerov. \"It's about protecting our peaceful cities and villages.\" 08:36 Star Wars Actor Launches Fundraiser for UkraineAmerican actor Mark Hamill, renowned for his role as Luke Skywalker in \"Star Wars,\" is raising funds for mine-clearing robots for Ukraine. Together with Eastern Europe expert Timothy Snyder, he aims to raise $441,000 through the \"Safe Terrain\" campaign. The robots can clear mines even in inaccessible areas, at a safe distance from the operators. \"One of the most heinous crimes Russia has committed in Ukraine is the scattering of countless mines,\" said Snyder. \"I've visited abandoned areas near the front where people take risks to help others return to their farms and homes. With these robots, mines can be cleared, and lives can be saved.\" Ukraine is heavily mined, and its demining could take decades. 08:01 Kremlin Prepares Russians for \"New Reality\"The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk poses a challenge for Moscow's propaganda. Although the territories are distant, a Kremlin-linked source informed the independent Russian portal Meduza, based in Riga, \"But even the penetration into Russian territory and the seizure of control over villages is a new and quite disturbing event.\" To alleviate the heightened apprehension that has arisen since the invasion of Kursk, the Kremlin is endeavoring to prepare Russians for living in \"a new reality\" and \"a new normality.\" The message is: The enemy has indeed entered Russian territory, its defeat is imminent - but the return of the territory will require time, and the Russians must be patient. In the meantime, they are encouraged to \"transform the negativity and shock into a positive expression\" - mainly by gathering aid supplies for the Kursk region. In general, all officials interviewed by Meduza concur that the fighting in the Kursk region could last for several months. A source close to the government notes that this time frame is \"quite optimistic - if things go well.\" 07:30 Fire in Military Facility Confirmed in Volgograd, RussiaRussian authorities have confirmed reports of a fire at a military installation in Volgograd, a region in southern Russia, following an attack by a Ukrainian drone. The regional governor, Andrei Bocharov, announced on Telegram that the drone had collided with the facility. Thankfully, no casualties were reported. Bocharov didn't specify which military facility was affected but mentioned that the village of Marinovka was targeted where Russia houses an airbase. 06:56 Former Advisor: Putin's Influence over Trump was Near HypnoticAs per former US national security advisor General Herbert Raymond McMaster, Russian President Vladimir Putin had an almost hypnotic influence over ex-US President Donald Trump.
