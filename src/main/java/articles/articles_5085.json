    "title": "Boeing Workers Strike After Nearly Unanimously Vote",
    "text": "Unionized Boeing factory workers asked the company for a 40 percent wage hike to avoid a strike. [Boeing offered them 25 percent.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/boeing-union-workers-pay-hike/) A strike it is! On Thursday, an overwhelming 96 percent of Boeing workers voted in favor of a work stoppage, the first in 16 years for the troubled aviation company. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District 751 [voted almost unanimously](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/13/boeing-union-contract-strike/) to reject a proposed four-year agreement that would address a series of long-standing grievances but didn’t address them well enough. The union says the proposed deal failed to meet the union’s demands for higher wages and better job security. Videos by VICE The Boeing strike affects assembly plants in Washington state, including its Everett and Renton plants, and could disrupt the company’s vast network of suppliers across the United States. The financial impact of the strike could be severe. Analysts [estimate](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/13/boeing-workers-strike-reject-contract.html) that a month-long work stoppage could cost Boeing approximately $1.5 billion, compounding the company’s existing financial woes. Boeing has struggled with safety and manufacturing issues in recent years, including a [significant crisis involving its 737 Max aircraft](https://www.vice.com/en/article/boeing-just-admitted-they-knew-about-an-issue-with-the-737-max-for-a-year/), which faced grounding and production delays due to safety concerns. There was optimism last week after the tentative deal, which featured the 25% raise over four years. But maybe the optimistic folks involved should have spoken to IAM District 751 President John Holden, who, in the immediate aftermath of the proposal, told the [ Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-machinists-union-chief-expects-members-will-reject-deal-strike/) that the deal would likely be rejected. One of the key points of contention was the elimination of an annual bonus program that workers would like to see brought back. Other workers who spoke to the Washington Post want to see a change in the company’s mandatory overtime rules. There’s still a ton of key sticking points to iron out. As one union member reportedly put it before voting for the Boeing strike, “Four years is not enough to make up for the last 16.”",

    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);) Gunmen armed with rocket-propelled grenades have ambushed a police convoy in Rahim Yar Khan district, eastern Punjab, resulting in at least 11 officers killed and seven others wounded. The attack, which occurred on Thursday, targeted the officers as they patrolled a remote area in search of robbers known to operate in the region. The assailants are suspected to be robbers rather than militants. The ambush took place in a particularly challenging area known for bandit hideouts along the Indus River. It is believed that one of the police vehicles broke down due to accumulated rainwater in the fields, which made the convoy vulnerable to the assault. Pakistan has been experiencing heavy monsoon rains since July, which may have exacerbated the situation. This attack is notable for its severity, as such a high number of police casualties in a single incident is rare in recent years. The incident has prompted swift condemnation from national leaders, including President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. They have expressed sorrow, labeled the fallen officers as martyrs, and urged immediate action against the perpetrators. Sharif has also demanded the best medical care for the wounded officers. Earlier the same day, a separate attack saw gunmen open fire on a school van in Punjab, killing two children and wounding six others. No group has claimed responsibility for either attack. The surge in violence and attacks in Pakistan underscores ongoing security challenges, particularly in rural and underserved areas.",

    "text": "Artificial Intelligence and Barbarism: A Critique of Digital Reason, by Alexandros Schismenos. A Provocative Critique of AI's unchecked Influence on Society 08-14-2025 08:25 AM CET | Arts & Culture\nPress release from: Athens School CoOp\nATHENS, GREECE - - As artificial intelligence rapidly reshapes every facet of human existence, a groundbreaking new book, Artificial Intelligence and Barbarism: A Critique of Digital Reason, by Alexandros Schismenos, challenges the prevailing narrative of technological progress. Published by Athens School, this timely work argues that the uncritical embrace of digital reason risks ushering in a new era of \"digital barbarism,\" where human autonomy and critical thought are subtly eroded by algorithmic control and pervasive \"mythinformation.\"\nSchismenos' critique delves into the philosophical underpinnings of AI, exposing how its seemingly neutral logic can mask mechanisms of political control and reshape our understanding of truth and reality. The book offers a vital counter-narrative to techno-utopian visions, urging readers to critically examine the societal implications of AI beyond its immediate functionalities. It posits that true progress requires a re-evaluation of our relationship with technology, emphasizing humanistic values over purely computational efficiency.\nThe author identifies two prevalent and often opposing societal responses to AI: \"technophilia,\" characterized by an uncritical belief in AI's promises and its capacity to enhance human life, and \"technophobia,\" defined by a fearful rejection of AI due to concerns about human enslavement to machines. The book's central contribution lies in its proposal of an \"intermediate path,\" termed \"technoscepticism.\" The book is structured across four chapters:\n○ Chapter One meticulously examines technoscepticism as a socio-historical critique of technology.\n○ Chapter Two delves into the metaphysical foundations of AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as a scientific program.\n○ Chapter Three offers a critical challenge to the prevailing ideology of AI as solely a corporate capitalist venture.\n○ Chapter Four articulates a vision for overcoming \"digital barbarism\" and advancing towards a future characterized by democratic digital humanism.\nThe book's articulation of \"technoscepticism\" as a distinct philosophical position, moving beyond the binary of uncritical acceptance or outright rejection, is a significant intellectual contribution. This nuanced stance is precisely what distinguishes the work within academic discourse, positioning it as a sophisticated and constructive voice in the ongoing debate about AI's societal role. This approach is highly appealing to scholarly audiences who seek rigorous, non-simplistic analyses that genuinely advance intellectual discussions rather than merely reiterating existing viewpoints.\nArtificial Intelligence and Barbarism: A Critique of Digital Reason is an essential read for scholars, policymakers, students, and anyone concerned with the ethical, social, and political dimensions of artificial intelligence. It provides a compelling framework for understanding the challenges posed by unchecked digital expansion and offers a philosophical lens through which to navigate the complexities of our increasingly AI-driven world.\nAbout the Author: Alexandros Schismenos holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy and is a post-doctoral researcher and critical theorist whose work focuses on the intersection of technology, society, and human values. He is also the author of Castoriadis Against Heidegger (Black Rose Books, 2024) and Castoriadis and Autonomy in the Twenty First Century (Bloomsbury Academic). His research is focused on dissecting the philosophical implications of digital advancements and challenging dominant narratives surrounding technological progress in the fields of AI ethics and critical theory.\nAbout the Book: Artificial Intelligence and Barbarism: A Critique of Digital Reason By Alexandros Schismenos.

    "title": "DANNY, KING OF THE BASEMENT Opens This Week at Children's Theatre of Charlotte",
    "text": "This weekend, Children’s Theatre of Charlotte will premiere in-house \"Danny, King of the Basement,\" a heartwarming and imaginative theatrical journey that captures the essence of childhood resilience and friendship. Adapted from the beloved novel by [David S. Craig](/people/David-S-Craig/), this production will move audiences to laughter and maybe a few tears with its touching narrative and vibrant characters. Set in a basement apartment building, \"Danny, King of the Basement\" follows the adventures of Danny, a young boy with an indomitable spirit. Despite facing challenges in his everyday life, including poverty and loneliness, Danny discovers solace and joy through his vivid imagination. With the help of his newfound friends and his unwavering belief in the power of creativity, Danny embarks on a magical quest to find his own place in the world. The play is directed by local artist, [Lakeetha Blakeney](/people/Lakeetha-Blakeney/). She was Children’s Theatre of Charlotte’s first recipient of the Paige Johnston Thomas Directing Assistantship. The program serves as a mentorship for raising directors in the industry memorializing Paige Johnston Thomas’ legacy and passion for theatre. Blakeney started her journey with Children’s Theatre of Charlotte as a Summer Camp student and continued taking classes through the Education programs. As an adult, she worked as a counselor for Summer Camp, toured the state as an actor with Resident Touring Company, and taught aspiring students as a Teaching Artist. Directing this show has become a full-circle moment for Blakeney. “For me, the overwhelming message in the play is that you are not alone,” says [Lakeetha Blakeney](/people/Lakeetha-Blakeney/). “Danny builds a community of friends from the kids that live in the neighborhood, and they support him in a way that he hasn’t gotten from the adults in his life. I think it’s important for kids to see it - those who may be dealing with the same things that Danny, Penelope, and Angelo are dealing with and to be reminded that they are not alone.” She wants children leaving the show to know that, “just because you’re small, doesn’t mean you can’t be big.” “Danny, King of the Basement'' runs from April 20-28.
