    "text": "La extensión del hielo marino mundial alcanzó un nuevo mínimo histórico en febrero\n- El hielo marino antártico alcanzó su cuarta extensión mensual más baja en febrero al estar un 26% por debajo de la media\n- Según Copernicus, el mes pasado fue el tercer febrero más cálido a nivel mundial, con una temperatura media de 13,36 °C\nLa extensión diaria del hielo marino mundial alcanzó un nuevo mínimo histórico a principios de febrero y se mantuvo por debajo del récord anterior de 2023 durante el resto del mes, que fue, además, el tercer febrero más cálido a nivel global, según el Servicio de Cambio Climático Copernicus (C3S).\nConcretamente, el hielo marino del Ártico se situó un 8% por debajo de la media, según el organismo de monitoreo del clima del programa espacial de la Unión Europea (UE).\nA su vez, el hielo marino antártico alcanzó su cuarta extensión mensual más baja en febrero al estar un 26% por debajo de la media.\nEs el tercer mes consecutivo en el que la extensión del hielo marino marca un récord para el mes correspondiente.\nCopernicus recuerda, sin embargo, que el nuevo mínimo registrado en el Ártico en febrero no es un mínimo histórico, ya que el hielo marino del Ártico se aproxima actualmente a su extensión máxima anual, que suele producirse en marzo.\nEl tercer febrero más cálido a nivel mundial\nLa extensión diaria de hielo marino podría haber alcanzado su mínimo anual hacia finales de mes. De confirmarse, sería el segundo mínimo más bajo registrado por satélite, un dato que solo será posible confirmar más adelante.\nA su vez, Copernicus ha señalado que el mes pasado fue el tercer febrero más cálido a nivel mundial, con una temperatura media del aire en superficie de 13,36 °C, 0,63 °C por encima de la media de 1991-2020 para febrero, y solo ligeramente más cálido, en 0,03 °C, que el cuarto más cálido de 2020.\nFebrero también se situó 1,59 °C por encima de la media estimada de 1850-1900 utilizada para definir el nivel preindustrial.\nFue el decimonoveno mes de los últimos 20 meses en el que la temperatura media mundial del aire en superficie superó en más de 1,5 °C la media de 1850-1900, según ha advertido el organismo con sede en la ciudad alemana de Bonn.\nInvierno boreal de 2025\nPor su parte, la temperatura media mundial del invierno boreal de 2025 (de diciembre de 2024 a febrero de 2025) fue la segunda más alta registrada, con 0,71 °C por encima de la media de 1991-2020 para estos tres meses. Se situó solamente 0,05 °C por debajo del récord establecido para el invierno boreal de 2024.\nEl periodo de 12 meses comprendido entre marzo de 2024 y febrero de 2025 fue a su vez 0,71 °C superior a la media de 1991-2020 y 1,59 °C superior al nivel preindustrial.\nSegún Samantha Burgess, del Centro Europeo de Previsiones Meteorológicas a Plazo Medio (CEPMPM), febrero de 2025 continúa la racha de temperaturas récord o casi récord observada a lo largo de los dos últimos años.\n\"Una de las consecuencias de un mundo más cálido es el derretimiento del hielo marino, y el récord o casi récord de cobertura de hielo marino en ambos polos ha llevado la cobertura global de hielo marino a un mínimo histórico\", ha señalado.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Stuttgart, May 24 (IANS/DPA) German authorities have detained an 18-year-old youth after he allegedly discussed carrying out a knife attack on a synagogue in the south-western German city of Heidelberg.\nThe suspect, who comes from the town of Weinheim, is being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, public prosecutors and criminal investigators in the south-western German state of Baden-Württemberg announced on Friday.\nHe allegedly plotted the potential attack with another 24-year-old suspect, who was shot and captured by the police earlier this month after a raid on the man's flat turned violent.\n\"The killing of one or more visitors during the attack on the synagogue with a subsequent martyr's death was discussed as the intended goal, in which both people wanted to be shot by emergency services,\" the authorities said.\nOn May 3, police raided the home of the 24-year-old suspect in the town of Bad Friedrichshall on suspicion of preparing a serious act of violence endangering the state.\nAccording to police, the 24-year-old suddenly took several kitchen knives and fled outside through a window while officers were in his flat.\nHe was caught by officers but, instead of surrendering, he threw a knife toward a policeman and charged. The officer shot the man.\nThe 24-year-old man was treated for his injuries and remains in police custody on allegations of attempted manslaughter and a particularly serious case of assault on police officers.\nAn analysis of evidence seized during the search revealed a link to the 18-year-old man from Weinheim, with whom the 24-year-old is said to have discussed a possible knife attack on visitors to a synagogue in Heidelberg in April 2024, according to investigators.\nThe 18-year-old's apartment was searched on May 18. He was arrested and remains in custody.\nAuthorities said that there are no indications of an imminent threat to visitors to the synagogue.\nMENAFN24052024000231011071ID1108254065\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "Attorney General Ashley Moody files a lawsuit against the Atlantic Coast Conference TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCJB) - Attorney General Ashley Moody on Thursday amped up a legal battle between Florida State University and the Atlantic Coast Conference, filing a lawsuit accusing the conference of violating the state’s public records laws by refusing to hand over media-rights contracts that are a critical element of the dispute. Florida State and the ACC have been fighting in court for months on two fronts: FSU’s home turf in Tallahassee and in North Carolina, where the conference is headquartered. Amid major conference realignments in college athletics, the cases are drawing intense scrutiny. The clashes hinge, in part, on the ACC’s contract with ESPN. Through the contract, the conference collects media revenues and distributes money to member schools to support their athletic programs. Moody in January sent a letter to the ACC seeking a number of documents related to the dispute, including the grant-of-rights agreement and the conference’s contract with ESPN. The ACC’s response to Moody said that some of the records she requested, including the grant-of-rights agreement, were already available publicly but the contract with ESPN was off-limits. Moody’s lawsuit filed Thursday argues that, under Florida’s broad open-records law, the contracts should not be shielded from scrutiny. “It is incredibly astounding that the media agreements would not be given to the State of Florida when the ACC is demanding over half a billion dollars from one of our entities,” said Ashley Moody, R- Attorney General. The ACC says contracts between ESPN and the conference are commercial agreements between two non-governmental entities and should not be considered public records. But the state’s lawsuit disputes that the records should be shielded.
