    "text": "She survived the 1970 Kent State shooting. Here's her message to student activists When Roseann \"Chic\" Canfora arrived at Ohio's Kent State University in 1968, she says she was constantly being given leaflets by anti-war activists on campus — and throwing them away. U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was dragging on and deeply unpopular with a growing number of Americans. Over time, Canfora became one of them. \"It wasn't until I was personally touched, losing friends in that war and seeing the draft that would now take my brothers to that war, that I stopped throwing the anti-war leaflets away and I paid attention,\" she recalls in an interview with NPR. She says she sees similarities with the students who are protesting at college campuses across the country today, calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and university divestment from companies linked to Israel. \"They at least know that they don't want any famine and suffering and death done in their name,\" she says. \"And so it's inspiring to see them having similar conversations that we had, saying 'We don't like what we're seeing and we need to speak out against it.' \" Colleges across the country are grappling with how to respond to the demonstrations, with many administrations calling in local and state police to disperse them. [More than 2,000 people](https://apnews.com/live/college-protests-palestine-updates)have been arrested at protests nationwide in the span of two weeks, with some injured in the process. House Speaker Mike Johnson even called on President Biden to [send the National Guard](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/mike-johnson-columbia-national-guard-00154199) to Columbia University last week, days before New York City police cleared out and [arrested some 300 protesters](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/01/1248401802/columbia-university-protests-new-york) there. Canfora is all too familiar with what can happen when the National Guard cracks down on campus demonstrations. As a sophomore, she was among the protesters rallying on May 4, 1970, when members of the Ohio National Guard [fired into a crowd of students](https://www.kent.edu/may-4-historical-accuracy), killing four and injuring nine — including her brother, Alan, who was one year her senior. \"My brother's roommate pulled me behind a parked car, and it was at that moment that I realized this was live ammunition because the car was riddled with bullets,\" she recalls. \"The glass of the car windows was shattering above us, and we could hear the M1 bullets zipping past our heads and bumping into the ground in the pavement around us. And it was a horrifying 13 seconds.\" Canfora emerged from the car to find Alan and came across several classmates injured, including two who later died. \"I ran to where I last saw him and saw the body of Jeff Miller at the foot of the hill, lying in a pool of blood,\" she remembers. \"I first thought it was my brother until I saw the clothing that he was wearing ... One of our friends came up behind me and said, 'Alan and Tom both got hit.' \" Canfora was one of 25 people indicted in connection with the demonstration, and among the vast majority who were later exonerated. \"Those trials were eventually thrown out for lack of evidence that we had participated in a riot,\" she explains. \"Even though we were grateful that those indictments were thrown out ... we had lost our opportunity to tell the world what happened that day.\" Canfora has spent the intervening decades working to correct the record and preserve the legacy of May 4 — and now works as a professional-in-residence at Kent State, teaching journalism and helping plan its annual commemorative events. The events at Kent State more than five decades ago, she says, hold some especially timely takeaways today. \"It's hard to believe that this will be our 54th year of returning to the Kent State campus to talk about what we witnessed and survived here, and to tell the truth that we know so that ... people learn the right lessons from what happened here so that students on college campuses can exercise their freedom of speech without the fear of being silenced or harmed,\" Canfora says. The words and actions that led to May 4th Anti-war protests on college campuses intensified after April 30, 1970, when President Richard Nixon announced the U.S. invasion of Cambodia — a marked escalation of a war that many hoped was winding down. Students nationwide held protests on May 1, a Friday. The situation in Kent [intensified over the weekend](https://www.kent.edu/may-4-historical-accuracy), as demonstrators — including college students — clashed with police downtown, prompting Kent Mayor LeRoy Satrom to ask the governor to dispatch the Ohio National Guard to the city. They arrived on Saturday night to find Kent State's wooden ROTC building on fire, burning to the ground. On Sunday, Canfora says students held a peaceful sit-on on campus, calling on the university president to get the National Guard off campus, to no avail. \"On Sunday night, three students were stabbed in the backs, in the legs by guardsmen and bayonets,\" she remembers. \"And that was all a foreshadowing of what was to come the next day, on Monday.\" Canfora says she can't talk about the use of excessive force — then and now — without \"tying it to the inflammatory rhetoric that inspired that force.\" Nixon referred to student protesters as \"bums,\" while then-California Gov. [Ronald Reagan](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/19/archives/reagan-remark-a-campaign-issue-bloodbath-comment-fuels-oratory-in.html) said \"if it takes bloodbath\" to deal with campus demonstrators \"let's get it over with.\" On May 3, Ohio Gov. Jim Rhodes [described](https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2020/05/the-failures-and-lies-behind-the-student-killings-of-1968-and-1970-are-still-with-us-just-in-other-forms.html) campus demonstrators as \"the worst type of people that we harbor in America.\" \"We were too young and naïve at 18 and 19 years old to know the danger of those inflammatory words,\" Canfora says. \"But we saw the repercussions of that when American soldiers turned their guns on American people — in fact, on American college students — because they were conditioned to see us as dangerous and an enemy. And we should all learn the lessons from that.\" She points out that the commission on campus unrest that Nixon formed in June 1970 would [issue a report](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED083899.pdf) calling the shootings \"unnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable,\" while an [FBI report](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/31/archives/excerpts-from-summary-of-fbi-report-on-kent-state-u-disorders-last.html) released later that year found reason to believe the Guard's claims of acting in self-defense were \"fabricated subsequent to the event.\" After an almost [decade-long legal battle](https://www.kent.edu/may-4-historical-accuracy), the Guardsmen settled out of court with more than two dozen defendants, though the state paid the families of injured students. The Ohio National Guard signed a statement that began, \"In retrospect, the tragedy of May 4, 1970 should not have occurred.\" Canfora also draws parallels [between the misinformation](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/02/1248634146/columbia-university-mayor-eric-adams-nypd-student-arrests) that ran rampant then and today, noting that \"excuses\" for the use of excessive force on campus began immediately after the shooting. Students had two hours to leave campus, and she remembers watching the theories take off on television from her family's house. \"I had an aunt that came into our home while my brother was still bandaged from his wound saying, 'You know, there was a sniper [threatening the Guardsmen],'\" she says. \"It was very difficult for middle America to believe that American soldiers would turn their guns on American people without some provocation.\" The shooting's legacy on Kent State campus activism Canfora and other students who survived the shooting returned to campus every year to tell their story and try to counter the rhetoric of the National Guard. But the university said in 1975 that \"five years was long enough to remember\" — prompting students to work with survivors to form the May 4th Task Force, which still organizes annual commemorations to this day. This year's includes the traditional candlelit walk around campus, a memorial service and special lectures. Canfora says many years of activism led to wins like markers where the injured students fell on campus, so cars can no longer park there, a May 4th walking tour and visitor center with archives. \"And most importantly, we have a university administration that doesn't ... distance themselves from the tragedy,\" she says. \"But they embrace their history and they feel a responsibility as Kent State University to teach others what we learned from that, to make sure it never happens again on a college campus in this country.\" Kent State University President Todd Diacon told NPR that the importance of kindness, respect, free speech and civic dialogue are \"baked into our DNA now,\" including in its statement of core values and the work of its School for Peace and Conflict Studies, founded in 1971. Students at Kent State University have been gathering on campus for vigils, signing statements of solidarity and advocating for things like divestment from weapons manufacturers, he says, but without breaking school rules on things like encampments. \"I would say literally all of them have really honored who we are as an institution and our aspirations for civic dialogue,\" he says. Diacon acknowledged that the situation is very different at other campuses around the country, and stressed that public universities like Kent State have much less leeway than private universities when it comes to restricting speech, and that even for public schools policies vary according to state law. \"I think there's no one size fits all when it comes to observing, or opining or evaluating how universities are addressing their situation,\" he says. Lessons for schools and protesters today Even so, Diacon says, there are certain lessons from the shooting that are broadly applicable today. One is the danger of armed action on a college campus, he says, particularly when it comes to the National Guard, who are not controlled by the university administration. \"I think a primary lesson from Kent State is you need to have local law enforcement in the lead if you're going to do something,\" he says. He also echoes Canfora's point that the shootings did not happen in a vacuum — both in that they were not the only campus protests, and they followed an \"dehumanization and demonization of opponents\" due to increasingly polarizing rhetoric over the Vietnam War. Canfora says she's inspired by what she's seeing from college students today, noting that they have much less free time for activism than her generation did — in part because so many have to work to afford tuition. Her college tuition was $197 a quarter, and room and board came out to $450 a year, which she was able to pay for with her minimum-wage job and spending money from her mom. In contrast, she sees many of her own students balancing full course loads with 40-hour work weeks. \"These students today don't have that time,\" she says. \"And they are finding that time to act, to make their voices heard.\" And that's important, she says, because — then and now — college students are \"the conscience of America.\" \"If not a college campus, where else in our society, in this democracy, can we count on large groups of people to do exactly what these college students are doing: paying attention to the world, looking at what is being done in the world ... and coming up with strategies for opposing it if they don't agree with it?\" she asks. \"That's healthy. That shouldn't be something that is feared.\" Copyright 2024 NPR",

    "title": "Silica Gel Packets: The Unexpected Heroes of Floral Preservation and Sustainability",
    "text": "In an era where sustainability and resourcefulness are more than just buzzwords, an everyday item found in our homes is emerging as a hero in the quest for preserving the beauty around us. I'm referring to the humble silica gel packets, those tiny sachets that accompany your new shoes, electronics, and even seaweed snacks. Beyond their traditional role of warding off moisture, these packets are now being hailed for their effectiveness in preserving flowers, a technique that breathes life into petals long after their prime.\nRevolutionizing Floral Preservation\nAt the heart of this revelation is a simple, yet ingenious method of drying flowers using silica gel packets. The process involves nestling the blooms among the tiny beads or granular silicic acid within the packets. These materials work diligently to absorb the moisture from the petals, leaving behind flowers that are dried yet vibrantly colored, maintaining much of their original beauty and form. This technique is not just for professional florists; it's accessible to anyone looking to hold onto the memory of a special bouquet or to create their own dried floral arrangements.\nEmpowering Reuse and Sustainability\nThe journey of a silica gel packet does not end with a single use. These packets can be reactivated and reused, a feature that aligns perfectly with today's push towards reducing waste. Reactivation typically involves heating the silica gel in an oven, a process that drives out the absorbed moisture and readies the packets for their next assignment. This cycle of use and reuse not only extends the life of silica gel packets but also underscores the potential of everyday items to serve new, unexpected purposes.\nCommunity Endorsements and Cautions\nThe versatility of silica gel packets has not gone unnoticed. On platforms like TikTok, users like Rachel have been vocal about their unconventional uses, from drying out wet phones and makeup brushes to preventing mold in wardrobes and tarnishing of jewelry. The enthusiasm for these little packets is palpable in customer reviews, with many praising their effectiveness in preserving the beauty of flowers. However, it's important to heed the cautionary note: despite their utility, silica gel packets can cause nausea and vomiting if ingested and pose a choking hazard, particularly to children. This risk is the reason behind the ubiquitous \"do not eat\" warnings that accompany them.\nThe narrative of silica gel packets is a testament to the ingenuity embedded in our daily lives. It highlights a broader theme of looking beyond the surface to find value and purpose in the most unexpected places. From preserving the ephemeral beauty of flowers to championing sustainability through reuse, these packets invite us to rethink our approach to everyday items. As we navigate our world, let's remember the lesson of the silica gel packets: sometimes, the smallest things can hold the key to preserving the beauty and resources of our planet.",

    "title": "BE diz que “uberização” traz “todos os riscos e custos” para os trabalhadores",
    "text": "A coordenadora do BE, Mariana Mortágua, afirmou este sábado que a “uberização” do trabalho traz “todos os riscos e todos os custos” para os trabalhadores, dando-lhes uma “falsa autonomia” e colocando-os a competir entre si pelo preço.\nIntervindo no 13.º Encontro Nacional do Trabalho do BE, que se realizou hoje no Centro de Artes e Ofícios de Ovar (distrito de Aveiro), Mariana Mortágua alertou para “uma nova forma de controlo, de gestão, de organização do trabalho que é mediada por plataformas como a Glovo ou a Uber”.\n“Mas não é só mediada por estas plataformas: é o que chamamos de “uberização””, acrescentou.\nSegundo a deputada, “esta nova forma de trabalho banaliza a transferência de riscos e custos do trabalho do empregador para o trabalhador”, sendo este que “agora tem todos os riscos e todos os custos”.\n“Se ficar doente, se tiver um acidente, qualquer risco associado ao seu trabalho, é da responsabilidade do trabalhador, que é também o gestor do seu próprio tempo, porque o patrão se demitiu da função de organizar o trabalho e de gerir o trabalho”, assinalou.\nMariana Mortágua alertou que “isto é vendido como uma autonomia, mas é uma falsa autonomia”.\n“Se não há um limite de oito horas de trabalho, se não há um limite ou uma obrigação para dias de férias, se não há uma obrigação que diga que quando há riscos de trabalho tu não podes trabalhar àquelas horas, o que vai acontecer é que essa autonomia se transforma numa pressão para que esse trabalhador trabalhe 12 horas por dia, para que trabalhe ao fim de semana”, prosseguiu.\nEstas situações, sublinhou, podem colocar em risco a própria vida e o próprio meio de sustento dos trabalhadores, sem que esteja garantido um salário mínimo e ao mesmo tempo em que é oferecida disponibilidade permanente.\n“Nunca houve uma centralização tão grande de todo o trabalho”\n“Nunca houve uma centralização tão grande de todo o trabalho”, denunciou a deputada, referindo-se ao controlo da localização através das plataformas e ao seu algoritmo informático.\nEstas empresas, acrescentou, têm “ao seu dispor uma multidão de trabalhadores que competem entre si pelo preço”.\nNa sua perspetiva, não é “inevitável que a tecnologia origine estas formas de trabalho”, considerando que “a “uberização” do trabalho é a materialização de décadas de alterações legislativas que visaram enfraquecer quaisquer condições e regulamentação do trabalho”.\nA coordenadora bloquista considerou que o neoliberalismo económico transforma os cidadãos “em indivíduos, atomizados, separados” entre si, sem uma “sociedade, comunidade, Estado”, num contexto em que “não há regra” nem lei e em que a riqueza está “cada vez mais concentrada num pequeno número de verdadeiros patrões”, enquanto todos os outros são “uma multidão de trabalhadores precários, a quem se chamam empreendedores e patrões”.\nMariana Mortágua contestou ainda o “sectarismo na organização laboral e nos sindicatos e o anacronismo na forma como alguns sindicatos veem o trabalho e se organizam”, que os impedem de representar a massa de trabalhadores destas plataformas, alvo de “precarização e exploração”.\n“Queremos encontrar aquilo que une todos os trabalhadores, migrantes ou não migrantes. Os que trabalham em nome individual ou os que têm um contrato coletivo de trabalho. As mulheres que fazem trabalho de limpeza na casa de outras pessoas e as pessoas que trabalham no âmbito de uma estrutura empresarial”, elencou.\nMortágua convida 800 mil trabalhadores por turnos a assinar petição para mudar lei\nA coordenadora do Bloco de Esquerda convidou os cerca de 800 mil trabalhadores por turnos em Portugal a assinarem uma petição para melhorar na lei as suas condições laborais.\n“Deixo aqui esta proposta, este apelo, uma petição para juntar toda a gente que trabalha por turnos. Uma petição para juntar 800 mil pessoas. Tempo para viver e saúde para vivê-la [a vida] com qualidade”, disse Mariana Mortágua no encerramento da sua intervenção no 13.º Encontro Nacional do Trabalho do BE, que decorreu no Centro de Artes e Ofícios de Ovar (distrito de Aveiro).\nEm causa está uma petição, lançada no endereço do partido trabalhoporturnos.bloco.org, dirigida ao presidente da Assembleia da República, José Pedro Aguiar-Branco, que visa a mudança na lei.\n“Lançamos uma petição a exigir uma coisa muito simples, que é tempo e saúde para todas as pessoas que trabalham por turnos”, materializada em medidas como subsídio de turno obrigatório, dois fins de semana a cada seis semanas para poder conciliar o trabalho com a sua vida familiar, descanso de 24 horas entre cada turno, limitação de 35 horas semanais de trabalho ou reforma antecipada com seis meses “por cada ano que passa com a vida ao contrário do relógio, por cada ano que passa no ritmo contrário ao do resto da sociedade e da sua família”, enumerou Mariana Mortágua.\nEstes trabalhadores “trabalham nos hospitais, na segurança, na indústria vidreira, na indústria automóvel, em “call centers” ou até em empresas que fazem batatas fritas ou rolhas de cortiça”, descreveu Mortágua, sendo “800 mil pessoas que têm a mesma experiência de viver ao contrário do relógio”.\n“Sabem o que é ser dia de Natal e não estarem com os filhos. Sabem o que é passar as férias, os momentos de família, longe de quem mais gostam”, além de não terem “tempo para estar, para combinar, para ter uma vida familiar”.\nSegundo a coordenadora do BE, estes trabalhadores vão para a reforma “na verdade, muito mais velhos que todos os outros, apesar de terem exatamente a mesma idade, porque o desgaste dos turnos, do trabalho noturno, de ter a vida sempre em contrarrelógio, conta e tira anos de vida e vida com saúde”.\nTambém há trabalhadores que não necessitariam de trabalhar por turnos porque “há empresas que não têm que estar em laboração contínua”, visando o BE “alterar os critérios que o determinam”, disse Mariana Mortágua.\nPara a deputada, estas 800 mil pessoas “tudo o que esperam e exigem é serem recompensados pelo seu trabalho, pelo seu esforço”, pretendendo a coordenadora do BE que, através da petição, façam “ouvir a sua voz a exigir uma alteração da lei”.\n“Se toda a gente que partilha a experiência do que é viver a vida ao contrário se unir para alterar a lei, então vamos conseguir alterar a lei”, pois “ninguém cala 800 mil pessoas”, vincou.",

    "text": "Firefighters in Snohomish County offer tips for warmth and safety during winter weather SNOHOMISH COUNTY, Wash. - Temperatures are dropping to frigid lows in western Washington this weekend. First responders and local groups are working to ensure people are indoors and safe in the winter conditions. Firefighters with South County Fire have been preparing to respond to emergencies during the cold blast. \"We have some snowplows ready so that we can clear a way for our rigs to get out to 911 calls because they’re always responding, no matter the weather,\" said Leslie Hynes, public information officer for South County Fire. Hynes said this is the peak time of year when firefighters respond to flames at a home sparked by unsafe heating practices. \"And that’s why it’s super important to make sure your smoke alarms are working,\" said Hynes. Those who are using space heaters to warm their home, firefighters suggest placing it three feet away from flammable items like couches and curtains. Anyone using generators to power and heat the home is advised to leave the generator outside. The machine creates carbon monoxide, an odorless gas that can be hazardous, even deadly. \"Making sure that [the generator] is a safe distance from your home and that the exhaust isn’t going into your home. And never use a generator in an enclosed space, like a garage or something like that. Keep it as far away from the home as you can,\" said Hynes. In partnership with King County Regional Homeless Authority, the Salvation Army is setting up extra beds to get as many people experiencing homelessness out of the frigid temperatures. \"This impacts health. Quite frankly, this impacts lives. So, I'm very worried. My hope is that the word gets out there. We know there is wonderful outreach out there spreading the word. I've personally hit the pavement going to encampments and saying, hey, we want you to come in,\" said Arlene Hampton, director of programs for Salvation Army - Seattle Social Service. Aside from its shelter, Hampton said the Salvation Army is setting up warm places to stay at Seattle City Hall’s 4th Avenue entrance, And the Expedition Hall at Seattle Center. \"We're serving up some meals, we have hats, and gloves, please come in because we know we're saving lives. We're helping people to survive throughout these times when the weather is just not sustainable, even for those who are accustomed to being out in the elements,\" said Hampton. Out in the elements, it could be slick on the roads. To reduce the risk of emergencies behind the wheel, Hynes said firefighters are asking people to stay home if they can. \"If we do get snow and ice on the roads, stay home. So, preparing now before the roads get icy, though we’re starting to see snow fall. Make sure you have all the supplies you need on hand, so you don’t have to go out,\" said Hynes. Anyone out driving in those conditions are encouraged to have at least one-fourth tank of gas in the car and keep an emergency preparedness kit in the car. This includes a blanket, water, snacks, and a fully charged cellphone in case of an emergency and waiting for help.",
