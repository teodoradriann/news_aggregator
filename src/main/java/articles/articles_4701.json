    "title": "Police fundraiser Jack Olson pleads guilty to tax evasion, conspiracy to commit wire fraud",
    "text": "Jack Olson, a longtime fundraiser for police organizations, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of tax evasion in federal court in Lincoln on Thursday. Sentencing will be Nov. 5. The 67-year-old from Council Bluffs was indicted in April 2023 alongside former Omaha Police Department Officers Richard Gonzalez and Johnny Palermo in relation to fraudulent fundraising activities for the Latino Peace Officers Association (LPOA). Olson initially faced eight felony charges: Wire fraud conspiracy, three counts of wire fraud and four counts of tax evasion. He will be sentenced to no more than 42 months in prison as part of the plea agreement. Under the plea agreement, Olson will also pay restitution of $27,111.25 to the LPOA and up to $30,883.33 to individual donors. The restitution amounts will be decided at sentencing. Olson would also pay $95,475 to the U.S. Department of Treasury. People are also reading… While both the state and Olson have agreed to the plea agreement, it will have to be approved by Olson’s sentencing judge. Olson can back out of his guilty plea if the judge does not agree to sentence him to no more than 42 months in prison. Under the plea agreement, Olson admitted he conspired with Gonzalez and Palermo between 2017 and April 2023 to defraud LPOA of money. Olson would solicit donations on behalf of LPOA and would keep approximately 65%-80% of the money, according to the plea agreement. The organization’s website stated that 100% of donations went to athletic programs for children, but the LPOA was not organizing and administering any athletic programs for children in Omaha at the time, according to the agreement. Olson spent a significant amount of the funds on personal expenses, the agreement said, and he was primarily paid via cash withdrawal from LPOA’s bank account or via cashier’s check. He deposited checks at the police credit union and received a percentage based on his contract with LPOA, according to the plea agreement. Olson did not file income tax returns from 2018 through 2021, resulting in an estimated tax loss of $95,705. Gonzalez and Palermo both pled guilty to wire fraud conspiracy in connection with the scheme and were sentenced to prison. Gonzalez was sentenced to 18 months and Palermo 24 months . Olson’s case is adjacent, though not directly related, to the prosecution of former Omaha City Councilman Vinny Palermo. Two grand jury indictments were handed down on the same day in April — one naming Gonzalez, Johnny Palermo and Olson; the other naming Gonzalez, Johnny Palermo and Vinny Palermo. Vinny Palermo and Johnny Palermo are not related. What you missed last week in notable Omaha crimes and court cases Last week's local crime and court updates from The World-Herald. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling to dismiss defamation and other claims for a Catholic priest accused of sexual misconduct against the Archdiocese of Omaha on Friday. A new lawsuit filed in Missouri accuses Omaha Archbishop George Lucas of sexually abusing a teen-aged seminarian in St. Louis in the late 1980s, an allegation that Lucas denies. Omaha's new $27 million juvenile detention center sits empty nearly a year after the controversial project's completition. From the Flatwater Free Press An Omaha man was sentenced on Wednesday to 16 months in federal prison for speeding past security at Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue and driving around the base with a gun in his vehicle in 2022. Multiple residents of a midtown Omaha apartment building were forced to evacuate after a fire broke out early Tuesday morning. An Omaha man pleaded no contest and was found guilty of felony motor vehicle homicide last week in connection with a crash that ejected and killed a passenger in his truck as he attempted to flee from a traffic stop. An Omaha man fatally shot another man near Carter Lake in May before setting fire to the stolen car used in the shooting, according to testimony Monday from an Omaha police detective.",

    "text": "6月23日，高考成绩查询通道陆续开启了。\n所有家里有高考生的家庭激动人心的时刻到了，寒窗苦读，拼智力、拼体力，为的不就是金榜题名的这一刻吗？\n可天津一个女生虽取得了701分的成绩，但女生一个提前的决定，却让她与北大清华失之交臂，这让不少人替她感慨太可惜了！\n作者-甜 编辑-*甜\n成绩出来的当时，老天好像和这个女生开了一个不大不小的玩笑。701分，不是因为她的成绩不够高，而是因为她的成绩超乎了她自己当时的预判。\n她的成绩高到了让她在成绩出来之前的一个决定显得无比遗憾。这位女生是天津南开中学理科实验班的一名毕业生，她的成绩在天津全市排名是前五十名的。\n成绩公布不久之后，不出所料，清华大学和北京大学的招生老师便打来了电话，在电话里面老师说以女生的高考成绩可以报考这两所学校当中任何一个非常不错的专业。\n其实正常来说，任何考生接到这通电话的时候都应该是激动无比，或者说这是对她学习成绩的一种认可。但是，这个电话对于这名女生来说是一种对她的最高肯定。\n但是也像是一把尖锐的刺刀一样。一切都来不及了。这都是归于在高考前女生出于对自己的分数过于保守谨慎的预期，权衡利弊报考强基的时候选择了上海交通大学。\n她的档案已经被上海交通大学给牢牢锁分了。“提前锁档”简简单单四个字，却让她的另一只脚无法迈进北大清华的大学校门。\n仔细看看女生的成绩单，让人不得不说一句，这学霸的成绩单就是不一样啊！在三门自选科目当中，有两门物理和生物学，女生都获得了100分的满分成绩。\n这意味着在这两门学科当中女生已经是到了没有上升空间的成绩了。唯一没有满分的化学，也是获得了97分的学霸成绩。再看看语文131分，数学131分。\n也是相当不错的成绩，没有明显的偏科的问题。外语142分，也说明了她的全面发展。这张成绩单上面的每一分都是她自己辛辛苦苦努力得来的。\n而这却因为不自信做出的一个“保守决定”让她与无数莘莘学子都梦寐以求的学习殿堂而擦肩而过。这种遗憾，不是因为她的个人实力问题，而是因为她少了一份和自己“赌一把”的勇气。\n在接到电话的那个时候，当时的心情恐怕只有她和她的家人心里才最清楚。其实上海交通大学也是一所顶尖高校，师资力量那也是相当的雄厚，还有先进的教学设施。\n还有就是从上海交通大学毕业之后，不需要任何条件就可以在上海落户。选择上海交通大学对这名女生来说并不意味着就是一件“坏事”，其实也意味着她将从另一个地方开启她的大学学业之旅。\n不过报考高考志愿选择本来就很就是一件非常个人化的问题，涉及到孩子和父母对未来的规划，和专业的喜好问题。甚至还有考量学校地域的问题。\n也许，报考成绩出来之前上海交通大学里面的一些专业更符合她个人的喜好，或者学校的氛围环境也有考虑在内，觉得更适合她吧。\n以前都是先出成绩，心里有底之后，再根据成绩去填报志愿。但是现在不一样了，现在是各种提前批、提前录取，强基计划这种，是给了考生机会。\n但是一不小心也有可能和梦想中的学校擦肩而过。也给不少考生带来了一些苦恼，同时也从某个角度上面增加了一定风险。其实有时候分数高不一定上名校，要看怎么去填报志愿了。\n好多地方还推出了高考指南，教学生怎么去填报志愿更加稳妥的相关问题。以前说数学拉分的话对成绩影响就会特别严重。但是现在的话语文在高考里面也是越来越重要了。\n这其实也间接性说明全面发展更为重要了。还有就是小科的得分也非常重要。\n现在强基计划成了关键，让很多考生都会遇到这种问题的发生。一旦锁定就无法改变了，这其实也有点像各个学校争先抢人的那个意思，提前早早做决定的人可能放弃成绩出来之后的更好的选择。\n这个女生其实就是一个很好的例子，如果她当时对自己的成绩拿出“赌一把”的勇气，说不定真去了清华北大了。\n事已至此，不管怎么说，还是前面说过的一句话，701分，成绩单上面的每一分，都是女孩通过自己的努力得来的成功果实。是女生努力的证明，也是为她的未来打下了基础。\n无论是擦肩而过的清华北大还是上海交通大学，相信这个女生都会凭借着她自己的努力发光发亮，在以后的人生道路上面实现她的人生价值的！\n声明：取材网络、谨慎鉴别",

    "text": "Il Ministero dell'Istruzione ha inviato una circolare in cui vieta l'utilizzo degli smartphone nelle scuole anche agli studenti delle scuole superiori. La decisione arriva dopo che organizzazioni internazionali come l'OCSE o l'OMS hanno segnalato la possibile correlazione tra l'utilizzo dei cellulari e il peggioramento del rendimento scolastico.\nIn Italia arriva lo stop ufficiale all'uso dei cellulari anche nelle scuole superiori: dopo aver proibito lo smartphone nelle scuole elementari e medie, il ministro dell'Istruzione e del Merito Giuseppe Valditara ha da poco diffuso una nuova circolare per estendere il divieto, a partire dal prossimo settembre, anche agli studenti delle scuole secondarie di secondo grado. Gli smartphone saranno vietati durante le attività didattiche e, più in generale, durante l'orario scolastico, con sanzioni previste per chi viola il divieto.\nLa misura, definita «improcrastinabile» dal ministro Valditara, punta a ridurre i potenziali effetti negativi sui minori derivanti da uso eccessivo o non corretto dello smartphone. In particolare, la decisione ministeriale arriva dopo che diverse organizzazioni internazionali, tra cui l'OCSE (Organizzazione per la Cooperazione e lo Sviluppo Economico) e l'OMS (Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità) hanno segnalato una possibile correlazione tra l'utilizzo eccessivo di smartphone e social media da parte degli adolescenti e il loro peggiore rendimento scolastico, con conseguenze negative che impattano anche sulla loro salute mentale. Secondo questi studi, in particolare, ad abusare di più dei social media è la fascia d'età dei 13 anni, con l'11% degli adolescenti totali che dimostra un uso scorretto degli smartphone.\nL'Italia, comunque, non è l'unico Paese a essere intervenuto in tal senso: Francia, Spagna, Svezia, Regno Unito e Repubblica Ceca hanno già adottato una serie di provvedimenti per limitare l'utilizzo dei cellulari nelle scuole, mentre l'Australia ha addirittura proibito l'utilizzo dei social media ai minori di 16 anni, con una storica legge approvata nel novembre del 2024.",

    "title": "Mysterious symbols found near footprints shed light on ancient humans’ awareness of dinosaurs, scientists say",
    "text": " Prehistoric humans in Brazil carved drawings in the rock next to dinosaur footprints, suggesting that they may have found them meaningful or interesting, a new study has found.\nThe rock carvings, which archaeologists call petroglyphs, are at a site called Serrote do Letreiro in Paraíba, an agricultural state on the eastern tip of Brazil. Researchers first observed the marks in 1975. But they are now interpreted as relating to the footprints following recent field surveys aided by drones, which uncovered previously unseen carvings. The tracks belong to dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period, which ended 66 million years ago.\nThe giant footprint left by a dinosaur was found on the Yorkshire Coast. Marie Woods/University of Manchester Related article Record-breaking dinosaur footprint appears on the Yorkshire coast\n“People usually think that Indigenous people weren’t aware of their surroundings or didn’t have any kind of scientific spirit or curiosity,” said study coauthor Leonardo Troiano, an archaeologist at the Institute of National Historic and Artistic Heritage in Brasilia. “But that’s not true. It’s very clear that they were interested in the footprints. We’ll never know if they knew about dinosaurs, but it is clear that they were curious about the prints and thought they were meaningful in some way.”\nThe Serrote do Letreiro petroglyphs aren’t the first examples of rock art found close to dinosaur prints, but the authors of the study said they believe that the unprecedented clarity of the association between the two at this particular site could have significant implications across paleontology, archaeology and cultural heritage studies.\nA dashed line indicates petroglyphs made by indigenous people, while a continuous line shows theropod dinosaur footprints. Leonardo Troiano Geometric shapes It’s unclear how long ago the petroglyphs were made. But the study — published in March in the journal Scientific Reports — notes that radiocarbon dating has found burial sites in the area to be between 9,400 and 2,620 years old, suggesting the tribes that left them must have lived during that time.\n“These people were probably living in small communities, using natural rocky shelters that are very abundant in the area,” Troiano said.\n“This region in Brazil is like the Outback in Australia — it’s really hot and there’s no shade, so it’s not easy to stand there and carve the rock. It requires a lot of effort, so when they picked this location, they were being very intentional,” he added. “They could have used so many other rock outcrops in the surroundings, but they chose this one.”\nThe drawings are varied in style, suggesting multiple artists might have had a hand in them. Some have shapes reminiscent of plants, while others resemble geometric forms, including squares, rectangles and circles. The circles have crosses or lines inside them, which might look like stars, Troiano said. However, what these markings mean remains a mystery.\n“They all seem to be abstract, and if they represented something to the people who made them, we don’t know what it is,” he said.\nA view of ancient stone carvings on a rocky point of the Amazon river that were exposed after water levels dropped to record lows during a drought in Manaus, Amazonas state, Brazil October 23, 2023. REUTERS/Suamy Beydoun Suamy Beydoun/Reuters Related article Ancient face carvings exposed as Amazon water level drops to record lows\nThe tracks at Serrote do Letreiro belong to three types of dinosaurs: theropods, sauropods and ornithopods. The researchers suspect that the people who carved the rock might have mistaken some of them for the footprints of rheas — large native birds similar to ostriches, which have tracks that look almost identical to those of theropod dinosaurs.\nIt’s harder to imagine what the prehistoric people could have thought of the sauropod prints, left by some of the largest herbivore dinosaurs that ever lived, and therefore unlike any animal that would have been familiar to them. Probably for this reason, an intentional association between the drawings and these particular prints is less clear, the study noted.\nDinosaur rituals Troiano said he believes that the marks might have been left during communal gatherings.\n“I think rock art creation was embedded in some sort of ritual context: people gathering and creating something, perhaps utilizing some psychotropics. We have a plant called jurema, which is hallucinogenic, and it’s still used to this day,” he said. “We can speculate that people were using it in the past as well because it’s so abundant and common in the region. I think they were interested in what the footprints represent, and I suppose they identified them as footprints. They noticed it wasn’t random.”\nA reconstruction of Homo naledi's head by paleoartist John Gurche, who spent some 700 hours recreating the head from bone scans. The find was announced by the University of the Witwatersrand, the National Geographic Society and the South African National Research Foundation and published in the journal eLife. Photo by Mark Thiessen/National Geographic Mark Thiessen/National Geographic Related article Mysterious species buried their dead and carved symbols 100,000 years before humans\nThere are other sites, Troiano said, with petroglyphs in the vicinity of dinosaur footprints — in the United States and Poland — but they are displaying “nowhere near the same level of intentionality,” he said. Intentionality is defined not only by how close the drawings are to the prints but also whether or not they overlap with them. If they don’t overlap, it suggests “thoughtfulness” by the makers, the study suggests.\nTroiano added that he’s working on a follow-up paper that will go deeper into the interpretation and the analysis of the Serrote do Letreiro petroglyphs, building upon the findings of the current study.\nThe direct association of the drawings with dinosaur fossil tracks is unique and may shed more light on rock art importance, meaning and significance, according to Radosław Palonka, an associate professor of archaeology at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland, who has worked on similar petroglyphs but was not involved in the study.\n“The fact that the locations of the rock art panels have been chosen specifically is shown by, among others, the fact that representatives of the communities that created rock paintings or petroglyphs often placed them very close to older images left by other cultures,” Palonka said via email. “This was the case in various parts of the world where rock art was practiced, and it is very clearly visible, among others, in the North American Southwest/U.S. Southwest, where my scientific interests are focusing.”\nThis petroglyph is the most notable and visible one at the site, according to Troiano. The circle is internally divided by lines and is of large dimensions. Leonardo Troiano Jan Simek, a distinguished professor of anthropology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, agreed. “The paper provides an interesting new example of how ancient people observed and incorporated fossils on the landscape into their religious experiences and interpretations,” said Simek, who also was not involved with the new petroglyphs study.\n“The (Stanford University) historian of science Adrienne Mayor has shown how ancient Greeks and Romans saw fossils as evidence of giants and monsters from their own mythologies and how indigenous North American peoples saw their origin narratives in the fossils they observed scattered across their landscapes,’ Simek said via email. “The Brazil case is another archaeological example of this very human tendency to tie the spiritual world created in the imagination to unexplained things in the world around us.”",
