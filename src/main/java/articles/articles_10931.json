    "text": "ROCKFORD, Mich. — On Thursday, residents of Cannon and Courtland Townships heard an update from the state on its now yearlong investigation into new PFAS detections in area residential wells. Near the main offices of Wolverine Worldwide, along and to the east of Courtland Drive — from 12 Mile Road in the north to the Luton Park area in the south — nearly 200 private wells were tested by EGLE and the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team. Of these wells, PFAS were detected in 59 of them, 24 of which exceed the state's standard for safe drinking water. First discovered in two shallow groundwater wells at [5312 11 Mile Road](https://www.michigan.gov/pfasresponse/investigations/sites-aoi/kent-county/5312-11-mile-road-ne) in 2023, the scope of the PFAS site has expanded to an area of multiple square miles as additional wells have yielded positive results. Shortly after the first detection, EGLE ordered Wolverine Worldwide to determine whether PFAS were flowing from its nearby facilities. During this time, documentation also revealed the footwear company had dredged and dumped contaminated sediment from the Rogue River onto its property. \"They know dang bloomin’ well what is happening here,\" said a man who lives \"right next door\" to Wolverine's facility. \"It's devastating to my family.\" During the public comment section of the meeting — held at Rockford High School — the man revealed his family's shared fight against cancer, as high PFAS exposure has been linked to certain types of the disease. His wife battled breast cancer twice and lost a kidney to the disease. His daughter fought it, too. For him, testicular cancer: \"We’re getting a little bit irritated,\" he said. \"I'm sorry for sounding upset, but I am.\" The town hall also featured the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team (MPART), the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS), and Leah Gies, the PFAS site lead for EGLE, who detailed how the state was continuing to confirm the source(s) of the contamination, largely believed to be related to Wolverine Worldwide's activity. The state reiterated that it would continue testing and pay for the installation of water filters at residences where PFAS had been detected, also noting that Wolverine Worldwide recently agreed with EGLE to sample for the forever chemicals both on-site at its Rockford-area facility and at two off-site locations. \"In my opinion, that's woefully short of what should be done,\" said another during public comment. While the drinking water in Linda Brauer's Cannon Township neighborhood is clean, according to city officials, the cancer survivor still showed up to the town hall — in remission and with concerns. \"I thought the PFAS epidemic was over,\" Brauer told FOX 17 on Thursday. \"When I heard this on the news today, I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, that's still a problem.'\" At a young age, Brauer's children — one of them adopted — were also diagnosed with cancer. Regardless of whether they were exposed to PFAS — and whether that possible exposure caused their cancer: \"We're trying to make a difference,\" she said. So, too, is Rick Rediske, who worked with Concerned Citizens for Responsible Remediation (CCRR) in 2012 to help expose Wolverine Worldwide's pollution in nearby Plainfield and Algoma Townships.

There's children that have been exposed,\" Rediske said. \"I want to see Wolverine be held responsible for the contamination.\" If you'd like to learn more about PFAS and the resources provided by the state, click [here](https://www.michigan.gov/pfasresponse/resources).",

    "text": "Competing in the decathlon – at which I won the gold medal at the 1980 and 1984 Olympic Games – I’ve seen performances by some inspirational women.\nBut the truth is, no matter how hard they trained, they could never have matched my times (other than the 1,500metre run, where some women could beat me).\nMy physique was too different – too male. It would have been grossly unfair for me to compete against them. My victory would have been a travesty.\nSo when I see trans women like American swimmer Lia Thomas or Canadian cyclist Veronica Ivy (formerly known as Rachel McKinnon) on the podium, I know they are biologically male and physical advantage has helped them to win.\nAll my sporting instincts rebel against that. For sport to mean anything, it must be fair.\nWomen’s 100m final of the 19th Asian Games at Hangzhou Olympic Sports Centre Stadium on September 30, 2023\nLia Thomas during a swminning meet on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in 2019\nThat’s why we need clarity – such as that offered by Boris Johnson, who said: ‘I don’t think biological males should be competing in female sporting events. Maybe that’s a controversial thing to say, but it just seems to me to be sensible.\n‘I also happen to think that women should have spaces – whether it’s in hospitals, prison or changing rooms – which are dedicated to women.’\nI, too, strongly oppose allowing trans women to take part in female sports. I don’t consider this controversial, nor political. It’s about fairness.\nTrans athletes say they do everything possible to compete fairly, for instance by taking testosterone blockers.\nLet us put aside the fact that I have strong reservations about the use of any hormone-altering drugs in sport.\nBut it seems patently obvious that no pill can wipe out the benefits that come from growing up biologically male in terms of muscular and skeletal strength.\nThese trans women have been through male puberty. They have longer limbs, broader shoulders, thicker bones, better power-to-weight ratios and larger heart and blood volumes.\nNothing they can do will change that: they are always going to outperform biological women.\nCanadian cyclist Rachel McKinnon warms up before competing in the 2019 UCI Track Cycling World Masters Championship in Manchester\nThis is a problem I have witnessed grow from a minor concern into a national controversy in sport – and beyond – although, in recent months, it does feel as though something is indeed changing.\nMy belief is that sport should have a women’s section and a new, open class where transgender women would be welcomed and could compete fairly.\nThere should be space for trans women in sport – but not at the expense of all women.\nLike any decent human being, I fully support the right of everyone to present however they want, use the name and pronouns they feel reflect their true selves, and live their lives as they wish.\nIt is sad that equal rights for transgender people have been suppressed for such a long time.\nOver the past 20 years, we’ve seen the emergence of a more compassionate society – but unfairness to women is the unintended consequence.\nAnd ridding ourselves of old-fashioned gender stereotypes should not result in potentially giving biologically male predators – who identify as female – access to women’s prisons or women’s domestic violence refuges.\nWomen have fought hard to achieve their safe spaces. They have to be respected.\nI’ve been increasingly outspoken about this on social media and people attending my gym in Putney, south-west London, have started to ask me about it.\nDaley Thompson waves to the crowd as he stands on the podium after winning a gold medal in the men’s decathlon at the 1984 Olympic Games i Los Angeles\nHow is any young girl going to feel inspired to take up sport if she knows she’ll be competing against – and losing to – biological males?\nAnd how can any parent feel their daughter is safe in a changing room where biologically-intact male athletes are dressing and showering alongside?\nSir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, found himself unable to say what a woman even is.\nIt’s not difficult – if in doubt, ask any five-year-old.\nI’m not interested in party politics. It doesn’t surprise me, though, that Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens are questioned by voters when they lack the courage to state simple biological facts.\nSome of my good friends, including the Czech-American tennis star Martina Navratilova and the record-breaking British competitive swimmer Sharron Davies, have done so and been on the receiving end of shocking abuse from trans extremists as a result.\nI want the whole world to know I stand beside them.\nI have also been appalled at the violent threats aimed at novelist J.K. Rowling, who has spoken nothing but calm common sense.\nDoes that make me a feminist? Well, no one has ever called me that before, but there’s a first time for everything.\nWhat I do know is that I’m not transphobic or a misogynist – two slurs that have been chucked at me on Twitter.\nIf we become afraid to tell the truth, we really are in trouble.\nAnd if trans women are allowed to compete in female categories, then women’s sport isn’t just in trouble – it’s finished.",
