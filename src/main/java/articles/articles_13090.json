    "text": "DEHRADUN: Several parts of Uttarakhand, particularly the Kumaon region districts that have been worst-affected by raging forest fires, experienced moderate to heavy rainfall on Wednesday. Bikram Singh, director of the regional meteorological centre, said, “A substantial amount of rain fell in Bageshwar, Pithoragarh and Almora. We expect majority of wildfires there have been extinguished by the downpour.”He further added that over the next couple of days, rains would intensify in other parts of the state and the remaining wildfires in Nainital, Pauri Garhwal, and Tehri Garhwal would also be doused.Met issues yellow alert for rain and storm till MondayWhile the fresh spell of downpour helped in controlling wildfires to a large extent, it led to some collateral damage as well. In Bageshwar district of Kumaon, the sudden heavy rain led to a flash flood-like situation, causing damage to some roads. The downpour threw normal life out of gear in the Someshwar area of Almora district, too, where debris entered several houses. The Almora-Kausani highway also got blocked due to the accumulation of slush brought by sudden rainfall. A similar situation was witnessed in Uttarkashi’s Purola region where the sudden downpour caused a flash-flood like situation in Kumola and Hudoli streams, causing the water level to rise quickly and alarming nearby residents. As a precautionary measure, the district administration temporarily halted vehicle movement over the Hudoli stream until the water receded. Devendra Patwal, the area’s district disaster management officer, confirmed that despite the swelling of streams, there was no loss of life or property. However, locals living close to these water bodies have been warned to remain vigilant. Significantly, the met centre has issued a yellow alert of rain, thunderstorm and lightning activities across the state till May 13.

    "title": "Wall Street to Cut 2,00,000 Jobs as AI Advances",
    "text": "Global banks are poised to cut up to 200,000 jobs over the next three to five years as artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly automates tasks currently performed by humans, according to Bloomberg Intelligence (BI).\nA recent BI report, based on surveys of chief information and technology officers, revealed that on average, banks expect to reduce their workforce by a net 3%. Back-office, middle-office, and operational roles are most vulnerable, as AI takes over routine, repetitive tasks.\nCustomer service functions, know-your-customer processes, and other administrative duties are also at risk of automation. However, Tomasz Noetzel, the BI senior analyst behind the report, noted that AI will not completely replace jobs but rather transform them.\nNearly 25% of the 93 respondents anticipate steeper cuts of 5% to 10% of their total headcount. The survey covered major players, including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nThe adoption of AI is expected to drive substantial changes across the industry, leading to improved profitability. By 2027, AI-powered productivity gains could increase banks’ pretax profits by 12% to 17%, potentially adding $180 billion to their bottom lines, BI estimates. Around 80% of respondents expect generative AI to boost productivity and revenue by at least 5% within the next five years.\nBanks have been modernizing their IT infrastructure for years to streamline processes and cut costs. The new wave of AI tools promises even greater productivity improvements. In a June report, Citigroup noted that the banking industry is likely to face more job displacement from AI than any other sector, with 54% of roles having high automation potential.\nDespite these projections, many firms emphasize that AI will transform roles rather than eliminate them entirely. Teresa Heitsenrether, who oversees JPMorgan’s AI initiatives, stated in November that generative AI has so far augmented jobs rather than replaced them.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon echoed this sentiment, highlighting AI’s potential to enhance workers’ quality of life. Speaking to Bloomberg Television in 2023, Dimon remarked that while some positions may be eliminated, technology will bring dramatic improvements. “Your children will live to 100 and not have cancer because of technology,” he said. “And they’ll probably be working three-and-a-half days a week.”",

    "text": "Зеленский: Путин понимает только силу. У США есть сила\nIcma.az сообщает, основываясь на информации сайта Haqqin.\nПрезидент Украины Владимир Зеленский в интервью BILD заявил, что атаки России с применением сотен беспилотников не связаны с операцией украинских спецслужб, а являются частью общей стратегии Кремля по затягиванию войны и поиску поводов для новых ударов.\n«Путин ищет причины для атаки и просто не хочет заканчивать войну», — отметил Зеленский.\nКомментируя переговоры, Зеленский подчеркнул, что Москва пытается создать видимость дипломатического диалога, чтобы избежать новых санкций. «Им важно показать Трампу, что между Украиной и Россией есть дипломатический мост. Путин всегда может сказать: «Мы разговариваем! Если санкции будут введены — переговоров больше не будет». Путин не хочет мира», — сказал он.\nПо словам украинского лидера, Кремль пытается навязать формат переговоров без участия США и Европы, чтобы изолировать Украину. Зеленский считает, что длительная война без поддержки партнеров — идеальный сценарий для Путина.\nГоворя о позиции Дональда Трампа, Зеленский заявил, что президент США «раскусил» Путина: «Россия просто лжет Трампу». При этом он добавил, что готов спокойно воспринимать любую тактику Трампа, если она поможет приблизить окончание войны.\n«Путин ничего не понимает, кроме силы. А у Америки есть эта сила и я очень надеюсь, что Америка это видит и понимает», — заявил Зеленский.\nУкраинский президент также вновь призвал к ужесточению антироссийских санкций. По его словам, главной ошибкой стало то, что санкции вводились слишком медленно, давая Москве время для адаптации. «Путин чувствует, что экономика страдает, но хочет выиграть время, прежде чем будут введены жесткие санкции. А нам нужны эти санкции уже сейчас», — подчеркнул Зеленский.\nОн добавил, что своевременные санкции помогут сохранить жизни украинцев. «Люди — это не дрова, которые мы подбрасываем в огонь. Мы не относимся к своим людям так, как это делают россияне», — заявил Зеленский.\nВ начале июня Зеленский сообщал о предложении Украины прекратить огонь до возможной встречи лидеров. Однако пресс-секретарь президента России Дмитрий Песков заявил, что встреча Владимира Путина, Дональда Трампа и Владимира Зеленского в ближайшее время невозможна.\nhttps://haqqin.az",

    "text": "U.S. Sen. John Fetterman ’s car crash Sunday, in which he was speeding and found “at fault,” was not the first time the senator has been involved in risky driving behaviors, Pennsylvania state records show.\nFetterman (D., Pa.) has received two speeding tickets in his home state — the more recent one of which was in March for exceeding the speed limit in Westmoreland County by 34 mph. Before this year, he was ticketed in April 2016 for going at least 24 mph above the speed limit in Warren County, according to state public records.\nAdvertisement After he received the ticket in March, Fetterman was required by Pennsylvania to take a “driver’s improvement course,” the Washington Post reported , citing unidentified people it said had knowledge of the situation.\nIn addition, the senator’s aides have said Fetterman has texted and FaceTimed while driving, ”prompting concerns among his staff and fears about riding with him,” the Post reported, citing three people with knowledge of staff discussions who spoke about internal conversations on the condition of anonymity.\nFurther, the Post reported, aides recently began to avoid riding in the car when Fetterman is driving and they refrain from contacting him when they know he is driving.\nThe article, written by Liz Goodwin, who covers Congress, said that Fetterman declined to answer specific questions about the allegations but a spokesperson for the senator called them “inaccurate” and “gossip.”\nA spokesperson for Fetterman did not immediately respond to The Inquirer’s request for comment on these allegations.\nThe Washington Post report comes soon after a series of departures from the high-profile senator’s office that included the exodus of his longtime political adviser and his former chief of staff as well as three top communications officials.\nA recent poll from The Inquirer, New York Times, and Siena College found that Fetterman’s overall favorability rating was at 48%, just 1 percentage point lower than that of Sen. Bob Casey , his U.S. Senate counterpart. An additional 41% of registered voters had unfavorable views of Fetterman\nSunday’s car crash, in Maryland, resulted in Fetterman, his wife, Gisele, and a Pennsylvania woman being sent to the hospital after the junior senator’s Chevrolet Traverse rear-ended the woman’s Chevrolet Impala, according to the Maryland State Police report.\nA witness observed Fetterman’s vehicle rear-ending the woman’s vehicle just before the exit for I-68 in Hancock, Md., between Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Fetterman was allegedly going over the posted speed limit, which was 70 mph.\nThe Maryland police report noted that the person who was hit was “not distracted,” while it was “unknown” whether the junior senator was distracted.\nFetterman and his wife were evaluated at a local hospital “out of an abundance of caution,” according to a statement Monday from Carrie Adams, the senator’s spokesperson. The pair’s 16th wedding anniversary was also on Sunday.\nNo citations were issued, and the Maryland State Police are investigating.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement",

    "text": "[Última hora en elEconomista.es15](/slices/web-slice.php?modulo=392)\nLa Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) ha informado de que la semana que viene, del 6 al 12 de enero, el tiempo será diferente al experimentado en la primera semana del año debido al paso de sucesivos frentes atlánticos sobre la Península.\nPor ello, será una semana con precipitaciones abundantes en el noroeste de la Península, que se extenderán a buena parte del territorio, aunque es poco probable que alcancen el extremo sureste. En cuanto a las temperaturas ascenderán, de forma que a partir de mediados de semana las heladas quedarán restringidas a zonas altas. Será una semana más cálida de lo normal para la época del año.\nViernes 3 de enero\nDurante este viernes, seguirán las lluvias asociadas a frentes atlánticos extendiéndose por el tercio norte peninsular, que podrán ser localmente fuertes y persistentes en el litoral gallego y moderadas en el norte de Castilla y León, fachada Cantábrica y Pirineos, donde predominarán los cielos nubosos o cubiertos. Podría incluso nevar a partir de los 2.000 metros en picos de Europa y Pirineos occidental y central.\nEn el resto de España, el tiempo será estable, aún con algunas nieblas en puntos de Madrid, La Mancha, la Meseta Norte y las depresiones del nordeste. Las temperaturas máximas ascenderán en el Valle del Ebro, con descensos o pocos cambios en el resto. El viento soplará del sur y oeste, con intervalos fuertes en áreas montañosas de la mitad este y probabilidad de rachas puntualmente muy fuertes en el extremo noroeste. En Canarias, la situación seguirá estable, con calima ligera en las Islas Orientales.\nSábado 4 de enero\nEl sábado se aproxima una borrasca al noroeste peninsular y continuarán las precipitaciones en Galicia, en cuyo litoral podrían continuar siendo localmente fuertes y persistentes, y también lloverá en el litoral cantábrico, en el Atlántico, Pirineos, aunque de forma más débil, dispersa y ocasional.\nEl tiempo seguirá estable en el resto de España, con probabilidad de nieblas principalmente de madrugada en la Meseta Norte y en las depresiones del nordeste. Continuará el ascenso de las temperaturas en la mitad norte, sin cambios en el resto.\nEl viento seguirá soplando del sur y oeste, y arreciará durante el día, pudiendo ser fuerte con rachas muy fuertes en puntos de Galicia y de la fachada cantábrica. En Canarias, la calima se extenderá al resto del archipiélago.\nDomingo 5 de enero\nDurante el domingo, la borrasca penetrará por el noroeste peninsular, y los frentes asociados dejarán los cielos muy nubosos en gran parte de España, con precipitaciones que, durante la primera mitad del día, afectarán al tercio oeste peninsular, pudiendo ser fuertes en el litoral gallego y sudoeste andaluz.\nPor la tarde, las precipitaciones afectarían a Galicia, Castilla-León, Castilla-La Mancha y Andalucía, así como a Madrid y a Extremadura, pudiendo extenderse a últimas horas algún punto más hacia el este peninsular, aunque de forma débil. Podrá nevar en algunas zonas montañosas.\nLas temperaturas tenderán a subir y el viento soplará del oeste y suroeste arreciando durante el día, con algún intervalo de fuerte en el cuadrante nordeste, en el mediterráneo y en zonas montañosas. En Canarias soplarán vientos flojos y la calima tenderá a disminuir.\nLunes 6 de enero\nDurante el lunes 6 de enero se espera que continúe el paso del frente atlántico impulsado por una borrasca al norte de la Península, con cielos nubosos y precipitaciones afectando a gran parte del territorio, siendo poco probables en el extremo oriental y Baleares y tendiendo a remitir a últimas horas del día. Nevará en zonas montañosas.\nLas temperaturas descenderán en gran parte del país y los vientos seguirán soplando de componente oeste, con algún intervalo de fuerte, más probables en zonas altas y en los litorales.\nEl portavoz de la AEMET, Luis Bañon, ha recalcado que la tendencia para el resto de la semana es que el martes haya cielos nubosos en la mitad norte con algunas precipitaciones; el miércoles se espera el paso de un frente frío de noroeste a sudeste peninsular con precipitaciones en la mitad oeste; el jueves continuarán las precipitaciones en la mitad norte en las primeras horas del día; y el viernes se prevé la llegada de un nuevo frente atlántico con precipitaciones en el noroeste peninsular.\nPor último el fin de semana del 11 y 12 de enero se espera una situación más estable. Las temperaturas se mantendrían en gran parte del territorio ligeramente por encima de los valores normales para la época y seguiría el dominio de vientos de componente oeste con algún intervalo fuerte en zonas altas y en litorales. En Canarias seguirá el tiempo estable con algunas calimas.",

    "title": "¿Por qué Rusia no participa en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024?",
    "text": "(CNN) -- El Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) decidió en octumbre de 2023 suspender la participación en los Juegos Olímpicos de París que están a punto de comenzar al Comité Olímpico Ruso, lo que implicó la pérdida de financiamiento y el hecho de que el COI se reserva el derecho de decidir sobre la participación de atletas con pasaporte ruso en tanto deportistas neutrales.\n¿Por qué el Comité Olímpico Internacional suspendió a Rusia?\nTras la invasión rusa de Ucrania —apoyada por Belarús— en febrero de 2022, el COI recomendó que se prohibiera a los atletas rusos y bielorrusos competir en eventos deportivos internacionales. En enero de 2023, el COI anunció su intención de permitir que estos atletas compitan como neutrales, de forma similar a cómo se presentan los tenistas rusos y bielorrusos en otros eventos deportivos como ATP, WTA y Grand Slam, sin ninguna referencia a su nacionalidad.\nLuego, sin embargo, el COI suspendió por completo al Comité Olímpico Ruso en octubre de 2023, debido a que Rusia había absorvido a las organizaciones deportivas regionales ucranianas en Donetsk, Jersón, Luhansk y Zaporiyia.\nCalendario de los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024: horarios, competiciones y fechas\n\"La decisión unilateral adoptada por el Comité Olímpico Ruso el 5 de octubre de 2023 de incluir entre sus miembros a las organizaciones deportivas regionales que están bajo la autoridad del Comité Olímpico Nacional (CON) de Ucrania (a saber, Donetsk, Jersón, Luhansk y Zaporiyia) constituye una violación de la Carta Olímpica porque viola la integridad territorial del CON de Ucrania, reconocida por el COI de conformidad con la Carta Olímpica\", afirma el COI sobre el episodio de octubre.\nPese a esa dura decisión, la comisión ejecutiva del COI dictaminó que sería injusto castigar a los atletas basándose únicamente en sus pasaportes, lo que abrió la posibilidad de permitir que algunos compitan en París, aunque bajo condiciones muy estrictas.\nMariya Lasitskene, del Comité Olímpico de Rusia, ganó la medalla de oro en salto de altura femenino en los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio. (Noticias de Kyodo/Getty Images)\n\"Sin bandera, himno, ni colores\"\nUn \"Atleta Neutral Individual\" es el nombre utilizado para referirse a los atletas con pasaporte ruso o bielorruso que competirán en los juegos de este año. Se hace referencia a estos atletas con la abreviatura AIN, que proviene de la traducción francesa Athlètes Individuels Neutres.\n¿Qué significa AIN en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024?\nA estos atletas se les permitirá competir siempre y cuando cumplan con los requisitos de elegibilidad.\n\"Las sanciones contra los responsables de la guerra, los Estados y gobiernos de Rusia y Belarús, siguen vigentes para los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024\", afirmó el COI en un comunicado.\n\"No se exhibirá ninguna bandera, ni se cantará el himno, ni se mostrarán colores ni ninguna otra identificación de Rusia o Belarús en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024, en ninguna sede oficial ni en ninguna función oficial\", continúa el comunicado.\nLa vestimenta de competición de los AIN aún no ha sido revelada, por lo que no está claro si llevarán los colores turquesa de la flamante bandera de los AIN, o si vestirán ropa deportiva básica. También se ha encargado un himno, sin letra, para su uso en ceremonias de entrega de medallas.\nAunque los AIN son elegibles para competir y ganar medallas olímpicas, no figurarán en el medallero de las naciones.\nLos AIN también serán excluidos del desfile de delegaciones en la Ceremonia de Apertura por ser atletas individuales y no un equipo, aunque el COI ha dicho que \"se les brindará la oportunidad de vivir el evento\".\nLa versión final de la bandera de AIN asignada por el COI el 19 de marzo. (COI)\nCuáles son los requisitos para competir como AIN\nEn diciembre de 2023, la Junta Ejecutiva del COI decidió que los atletas rusos y bielorrusos que se clasificaron a través de los sistemas de clasificación existentes de las federaciones internacionales tendrían que cumplir requisitos estrictos para ser seleccionados como AIN.\nNo habrá representación rusa ni bielorrusa en las pruebas por equipos y la participación se limitará a la competencia individual.\nSegún el COI, los atletas que apoyen activamente la guerra o que estén contratados por el ejército o las agencias de seguridad nacional rusas o bielorrusas no serán elegibles para inscribirse ni competir. La misma estipulación se aplica al personal de soporte.\nComo todos los demás atletas, los AIN deberán cumplir requisitos antidopaje para ser considerados para la selección.\nLa elegibilidad de estos atletas será determinada por el recientemente establecido Panel de Revisión de Elegibilidad de Atletas Neutrales Individuales.\nEn los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio 2020 (aplazados hasta 2021 debido a la pandemia de covid-19) y en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de 2022 en Beijing, los atletas rusos compitieron bajo el nombre del Comité Olímpico Ruso (ROC) como resultado de un dopaje patrocinado por el Estado.\nCuántos AIN competirán en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024\nEl COI afirmó que, hasta el 28 de marzo, 12 AIN con pasaporte ruso y siete AIN con pasaporte bielorruso se habían clasificado para París 2024. \"El número máximo, que es poco probable que se alcance, sería 55 y 28 respectivamente\", dijo el COI a CNN.\nEn comparación, Rusia envió 330 atletas a Tokio en 2021, mientras que Belarús envió 104.\nTambién está la cuestión de si Moscú aceptará realmente las condiciones establecidas por el COI. Es que Rusia planea organizar sus propios \"Juegos de la Amistad\" a finales de este año, un evento que ha sido condenado por el COI.\nLa identidad de los atletas aún no se ha revelado, pero es posible que el exnúmero 1 del mundo, el tenista ruso Daniil Medvedev, forme parte del campo. El excampeón del US Open dijo que estaría feliz de participar como un actor neutral.\n\"Decidí por mí mismo que siempre que pueda participar en los Juegos Olímpicos, quiero estar allí y quiero representar lo que pueda representar\", dijo a los periodistas el mes pasado. \"Si no es bajo la bandera, (igual) sé quién soy, sé por qué juego tenis y jugué así toda mi vida\".\nCon información de Sam Joseph, de CNN\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
