    "text": "Bomberos de San Sebastián están rescatando a usuarios de la noria ubicada en el Alderdi Eder de la capital guipuzcoana, después de que la instalación sufriera una avería sobre las siete de la tarde de este jueves, dejando suspendidas en el aire a unas 90 personas que ocupaban las 24 cabinas de la atracción. Según han informado fuentes municipales, el incidente ha ocurrido sobre las siete de la tarde, en hora punta de la noria de 32 metros de altura, que tenía ocupadas todas sus cabinas. Los responsables de la misma han intentado arreglar la avería durante una hora, sin éxito. Transcurrido ese tiempo han avisado a los bomberos, quienes tras comprobar que tampoco se podía reanudar la marcha de la instalación, han decidido ir rescatando poco a poco, mediante dos escalas, a todos los usuarios atrapados. Sobre las nueve de la noche los bomberos habían rescatado ya a personal que ocupaba diez cabinas de las 24, y siguen desalojando a más clientes, que se encuentran \"tranquilos\", sin que se hayan producido daños personales.

    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK. The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents. Systems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. Some forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate. Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74 Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34 The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion. – Gwent Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries. – Hampshire & Isle of Wight Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4 – Hertfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record. – Humberside Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2 – Kent Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6 The force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached. Markers are optional and added at the discretion of the inputting officer. – Lancashire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures had been compiled by searching for hate crimes marked as religious, followed by a manual review of each recorded crime to extract only those that were antisemitic and Islamophobic. – Leicestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 17, 2023 – 6 – Merseyside Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 20 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 10 The force said 18 of the 20 antisemitic offences in 2023 are conflict related and one of the 10 Islamophobic offences in 2023 is conflict related. – Norfolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 0 – North Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 – North Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 2 The force said the numbers are for offences “reported” to the police. – Northamptonshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures show crimes with a racial or religious flag against them, where the search was for the words “Jewish” “Hebrew” “Judaistic”, “Hasidic”, “Islam” and “Muslim”. The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures. – Northumbria Antisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim. – Nottinghamshire Antisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19 The force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker. – South Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8 Islamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9 The force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”. – Suffolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0 – Surrey Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10 The force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member. – Thames Valley Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21 Islamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20 – Warwickshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: No information held The force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods. – West Mercia Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4 – West Midlands Antisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22 Islamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25 The force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”. – West Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53 Islamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49 The force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted. The force added: “We continue to work to better improve the investigation of hate crime and the outcomes for victims. The force has specialist hate crime co-ordinators who assist investigating officers in identifying perpetrators, providing after-care support for victims and working with communities to increase awareness of hate crime and reporting mechanisms. They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.” – Wiltshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 Some 15 forces are not included in this list.

    "text": "3-minute read PATERSON — The lawyer representing Spencer Finch, the city police officer fired three years ago over excessive force accusations, is asking the courts to scrap the charges against his client, who was acquitted in a separate case last December. Attorney Eric Kleiner filed his motion to dismiss the indictment Thursday, asserting that Finch has been targeted in “a bad faith selective prosecution,” arguing that prosecutors failed to share evidence that would have helped the former officer’s case. Speaking in court on Thursday afternoon, Kleiner said Finch attended an April 4 Policemen's Benevolent Association meeting where he learned information that Kleiner said the prosecutors should have revealed to him before the first trial. Story continues after photo gallery. The lawyer said someone at the PBA meeting told Finch that Brandon Cosby, the man he was accused of assaulting, had made phone calls in which he spoke to police dispatchers “in a loud, aggressive, and threatening manner that indicated he was out-of-control.” Kleiner said the prosecutor’s alleged withholding of evidence in the first trial showed that Finch was being treated unfairly and should be part of the basis for dismissing the second indictment. The defense lawyer asserted that he still has not received all the records he requested from the Prosecutor’s Office in the second case involving Finch’s use of force while arresting Justin Montgomery in 2018. Montgomery had allegedly stolen ice cream from a convenience store. More: Paterson police officers took the Fifth in a grand jury session involving Spencer Finch “Now, after one acquittal and after the defendant’s family has been robbed of their retirement savings and other funds, the prosecution is moving forward with the remaining weaker indictment,” Kleiner wrote in his motion. “The instant matter,” Kleiner continued, “stems from a frivolous allegation that Finch used excessive force to subdue Montgomery, a strong-arm robbery suspect who attacked Finch and other officers on scene, likely while attempting to flee from the location where the alleged robbery occurred when police responded.” $500,000 settlement for Montgomery from Paterson Paterson officials already have approved a $500,000 settlement for Montgomery in the lawsuit he filed against the city. Chief Assistant Passaic County Prosecutor Peter Foy, head of the Public Integrity Unit, said Thursday afternoon that he has not had a chance to read Kleiner’s motion. Superior Court Judge Marilyn Clark gave Foy until May 31 to respond to Kleiner’s request for the indictment’s dismissal. “I provided everything I have,” Foy told Clark during the court session. But Kleiner said he was not buying the prosecutor’s assurances. “I look at that with a jaundiced eye,” the defense lawyer said. Finch’s termination in 2021 was a milestone in several respects. He was the first Paterson officer charged with crimes based on police body-camera video evidence. He also was the first Paterson officer in many decades who was fired while criminal charges were pending against him. Others accused of crimes were terminated only after they were convicted. Finch’s lawyer has blamed Mayor Andre Sayegh, saying he targeted Finch to score “political points” before his 2022 election run. Kleiner also has called into question the timing of the charges, noting that authorities indicted Finch in the 2021 Cosby incident within a year but waited more than four years before getting an indictment in the 2018 Montgomery encounter. More: What’s next for Paterson after Spencer Finch's acquittal on excessive force charges? “The Montgomery case was dead on arrival until the Cosby case came about,” Kleiner wrote in his brief. “These charges regarding Montgomery were dusted off and taken from the trash bin in order to force Finch to take a guilty plea.” But Finch refused to plead guilty. Kleiner said the courts should dimiss the second indictment so that Finch can resume working as a Paterson police officer.",

    "text": "Ange Postecoglou blamed the tiredness of his injury-ravaged Tottenham squad after they suffered a thumping 4-2 defeat at Brighton on Thursday night. A brace of penalties from Joao Pedro and strikes from teenager Josh Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinan gave the Seagulls a four-goal lead before a late onslaught from Postecoglou's side. Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies pulled back what seemed like consolations, only for Postecoglou's side to bombard Brighton with a flurry of shots in the closing stages. Tottenham had a host of players missing through injury and suspension, with key centre back Cristian Romero ruled out before the game for five weeks and Oliver Skipp missing out after picking up a late knock. 'We probably looked a little bit tired,' said Postecoglou. 'The lads have put in a hell of a shift over the past few weeks. Ange Postecoglou watched his side go four goals down to the Seagulls before a late fightback Tottenham suffered a miserable night on a night where their makeshift defence was exposed Your browser does not support iframes. 'We looked leggy and Brighton are always a good side. We hung in there until the end and I can't fault the effort. 'The team continue to show character.

You can go to the well so many times, the way we play. The players have given everything. That's all we can ask from them.' Brighton forward Danny Welbeck said: 'It was a good performance. 'The first half was brilliant from us and we played some good football in the second half. We hurt them, we exposed their weakness.'",

    "title": "Bugs no Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 fazem notas na Steam e Metacritic despencarem",
    "text": "13 Novembro 2024\n21 de novembro de 2024 [0](#comments)\nO Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 foi lançado em 19 de novembro, mas infelizmente está sofrendo uma péssima recepção pelos jogadores. A causa são os vários problemas encontrados tanto por jogadores quanto pelos gamers que receberam o título antecipadamente para análise.\nDentre os problemas relatados estão travamentos constantes, bugs no streaming e acesso aos servidores. Além disso, vários jogadores criticam a decisão da Microsoft de manter o jogo online até no modo carreira, apontando este como um dos responsáveis pelos problemas que sobrecarregaram os servidores no lançamento.\nA quantidade de reclamações é tão grande que o Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 está com nota 4,5 de 10 no Metacritic e 83% de avaliações negativas no Steam. Confira algumas das avaliações:\nLançamento péssimo e um fracasso total da Microsoft. Empresa de trilhões que não aprendeu absolutamente nada em 4 anos. Impressionante. Você paga R$ 500 pra ficar olhando para uma tela de carregamento por horas, se fosse classificado como um simulador de carregamento ou simulador de fila de espera seria fantástico.\n5h tentando entrar no jogo e não sai do trailer aguardando baixar os complementos.\nEsperava que depois de dois dias já tivesse resolvido isso.\nTenho um Intel i9 10900KF, SSD M2, 64 md de RAM e uma RTX 3070, máquina razoável.... Simplesmente não consegui rodar, frames abaixo de 20 fps!!!\nApós receber a enxurrada de críticas, o CEO do Asobo Studio e chefe de desenvolvimento do Microsoft Flight Simulator emitiu o seguinte pedidos de desculpas no vídeo acima:\nEstamos muito arrependidos, queremos pedir desculpas. Esse vídeo, nós fizemos pois estamos sempre aqui, queremos ser o mais transparente possível. Nós temos alguns problemas hoje, a equipe está trabalhando e vamos seguir em frente.\nO Asobo Studio afirma ter solucionado os problemas, detalhando suas causas:\nLogo no início, quando os jogadores começam a jogar, eles pedem a um servidor que lhes forneça dados e este servidor os salvará em um banco de dados. Este é um banco de dados muito grande, com cache, e esse cache está ficando cheio. Executamos testes de carga simulando 200.000 usuários e esta noite estamos completamente sobrecarregados.\nTentámos reiniciar os serviços, tomámos medidas para limitar o número de pessoas que podem entrar ao mesmo tempo. Funcionou muito bem, aumentamos o tamanho da fila em cinco vezes, a velocidade, e funcionou bem por meia hora e, de repente, o cache travou novamente.\nApesar disso, vários usuários da Microsoft Store ainda publicam avaliações dizendo que o jogo não está bem otimizado nos PCs, apresenta lentidão ao se conectar aos servidores e tem bugs ao iniciar o modo carreira.\nFalando no Flight Simulator, é provável que este seja o próximo jogo da Microsoft a chegar ao PlayStation junto do Forza Horizon 5.\nNada de Black Fraude! Ferramenta do TudoCelular desvenda ofertas falsas\nMicrosoft destaca novos recursos na build 26100.1876 do Windows 11 24H2\nPS5: Sony começará a vender consoles equipados com peças de reposição\nHuawei Kirin 9010L: chipset inédito é encontrado em smartphone intermediário da chinesa",
