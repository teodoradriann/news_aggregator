    "text": "Gli italiani credono nell’importanza dell’informazione, ma non riescono a orientarsi tra le molteplici fonti a disposizione. È quanto emerge dalla ricerca “ Senza filtri: l’informazione nell’epoca della disintermediazione tra opportunità e caos ”, promossa da INC – PR Agency content First , in occasione dei suoi 50 anni di attività, e realizzata da AstraRicerche su un campione rappresentativo della popolazione italiana (1.023 interviste, 18-70 anni).\nIl paradosso informativo: ci si informa dove si ha meno fiducia Il dato più sorprendente riguarda la discrepanza tra canali usati e percezione di affidabilità :\n8 italiani su 10 ammettono di fare fatica a capire se una notizia è vera o falsa. Il 42% ha condiviso almeno una volta notizie che si sono poi rivelate false. Eppure, social media e motori di ricerca – ritenuti poco affidabili – restano tra le fonti più utilizzate. La TV (70,8%) e i quotidiani (40,8%) sono invece considerati i più affidabili, ma vengono consultati meno rispetto a amici e conoscenti (61,6%) , social network (60%) e messaggistica privata (57,1%) .\nUn comportamento che riflette una “ dieta informativa ” guidata più dall’abitudine e dalla comodità che da una vera scelta consapevole.\n“Viviamo in un’epoca di informazione onnipresente ma fiducia intermittente. C’è un forte bisogno di affidabilità e competenza, non solo da parte dei giornalisti, ma anche di influencer, creator e comunicatori aziendali”, sottolinea Pasquale De Palma , Presidente e CEO di INC.\nUn popolo connesso ma disorientato La ricerca mostra un forte consumo di contenuti, ma anche una scarsa profondità di fruizione:\nIl 63,5% dedica meno di mezz’ora al giorno all’informazione. Solo il 13,4% si informa per un’ora o più. Il 59,5% si trova spesso a dubitare della veridicità delle notizie che legge. Nonostante ciò, il 41% considera “così così” la difficoltà di distinguere il vero dal falso : un segnale che il fenomeno della disinformazione potrebbe essere sottovalutato.\nLe fonti più credibili? Non sono influencer né politici Quando si parla di chi fornisce l’informazione, la fiducia va in ordine decrescente a:\nDivulgatori scientifici, ricercatori e docenti (45,7%) Giornalisti (41,7%) Istituzioni e politici (25,6%) Amici e conoscenti (29%) Influencer e youtuber (8,2%) La fiducia nei personaggi pubblici è bassa, mentre si nota un crescente apprezzamento per figure esperte e specializzate, anche non giornalistiche.\nIntelligenza Artificiale e personalizzazione: opportunità o minaccia? La presenza dell’ AI nel mondo dell’informazione genera più timori che speranze:\nIl 58,4% teme notizie false generate dall’Intelligenza Artificiale. Il 57% ritiene che l’AI possa ridurre la propensione a verificare le fonti. Solo il 37,9% la considera un aiuto. Anche la personalizzazione delle notizie online , pur nota al 70% degli italiani, è vista con sospetto: il 60% teme che rafforzi solo le opinioni preesistenti e limiti la varietà delle informazioni.\nServe più regolamentazione (anche per chi non è giornalista) Secondo il 62,3% degli intervistati, le regole deontologiche del giornalismo dovrebbero valere anche per chi comunica online , ma metà degli italiani pensa che nemmeno i giornalisti le rispettino pienamente.\nIl controllo sulle fake news? Deve essere indipendente e imparziale, non lasciato solo agli utenti o agli algoritmi delle piattaforme.\n“Non serve tornare a un passato elitario con pochi detentori dell’informazione, ma costruire un ecosistema dove libertà significhi anche qualità”, afferma Cosimo Finzi , direttore di AstraRicerche.",

    "text": "Credit: Getty Images The recent drama involving Kyle Juszczyk and the San Francisco 49ers took an unexpected turn when former NFL player Isaac Rochell used a pop culture reference to explain the situation. Rochell, who played for teams like the Chargers, Colts, Browns, and Raiders during his seven-season career, compared Juszczyk's release and re-signing to the plot of the teen classic Mean Girls — and the comparison couldn't have been more spot-on.\nIsaac Rochell Compares Kyle Juszczyk’s 49ers Drama to Mean Girls\nKyle Juszczyk, a key figure in the 49ers’ offense, was released by the team on Tuesday, March 11, in a surprising move that left many in the NFL community stunned. However, the shock was short-lived, as Juszczyk re-signed with the 49ers just days later on Saturday, March 14, with a two-year, $8 million contract.\nRochell took to TikTok on Sunday, March 16, to break down the chaotic situation with a humorous twist. \"Kyle Juszczyk is our Cady Heron,” Rochell said, referring to Lindsay Lohan’s character in Mean Girls. He then compared the 49ers to the Plastics, the exclusive high school clique led by Rachel McAdams’ Regina George. Rochell explained that Juszczyk had been welcomed into the 49ers’ offense as a foundational piece. “You are the cornerstone of everything we're doing,” Rochell said, channeling the Plastics' initial embrace of Cady Heron.\nHowever, things quickly changed when the 49ers decided to part ways with Juszczyk. \"Cady Heron cast out by the Plastics,” Rochell said, drawing a direct link between Juszczyk’s abrupt release and Cady's fallout with the Plastics in the movie.\nThe fallout wasn't limited to Juszczyk himself. His wife, Kristin Juszczyk, reacted to the news on her Instagram Story, sharing a picture of one of their dogs looking annoyed, with the caption \"Mood.\" Rochell suggested that the 49ers’ decision sent a message not just to Kyle but also to Kristin. “Kristin Juszczyk, we don’t want you,” Rochell remarked, emphasizing the personal impact of the release.\nFollowing Juszczyk’s release, questions swirled about how the 49ers’ offense would function without their star fullback. Rochell noted that the 49ers were forced to reassess their strategy. “They don’t have a fullback now. That changes the whole dynamic of their offense,” Rochell explained.\nThe story took another twist when Sydney Warner, the wife of 49ers linebacker Fred Warner, posted cryptic messages on Instagram that fueled speculation. On the day of Juszczyk’s release, Sydney posted a cheerful photo with the caption \"The happiest of Mondays,\" followed by another post referencing a “glorious evening.” Although she didn’t name names, fans were quick to speculate that Sydney was subtly reacting to Juszczyk’s departure.\nJust days later, the 49ers reversed course and brought Juszczyk back into the fold. “The Plastics called [Cady] back,” Rochell said, highlighting how the team’s decision mirrored the storyline of Mean Girls where Cady eventually regains her status. Rochell jokingly asked whether 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan was playing the role of Regina George in this real-life drama.\nKristin Juszczyk celebrated her husband’s return with an emotional Instagram post. Reflecting on their eight years with the team, she wrote, “We grew up here. We turned friends into family here. We won championships here and we lost championships here.” She added, “Kyle’s curtain isn’t closed just yet, and we couldn’t be more happy and emotional to stay home!!! ❤️ We’re forever Faithful.”\nAlso Read: \"14 years?\": Cam Newton addresses NFL drug testing loophole after Pacman Jones’ 14-year cheating confession\nThe saga of Kyle Juszczyk’s release and return underscores the unpredictable nature of the NFL — and Rochell’s Mean Girls analogy provided a lighthearted yet insightful lens to view the drama.\nGet the latest IPL 2025 updates on Times of India , including match schedules , team squads , and live scores for CSK , MI , RCB , KKR , SRH , LSG , DC , GT , PBKS , and RR .

    "title": "Electrification of Permian Faces a Problem: Not Enough Shock for the System",
    "text": "Since 2020, a lot of Permian Basin operators have made public commitments to reduce emissions, with electrification of field equipment a top priority.\nThat year, the United Nations Race to Zero campaign launched, encouraging companies and countries to pledge to make their operations neutral by 2050.\n[BP](https://www.hartenergy.com/companies/bp-plc) executives made a net-zero pledge, saying the company would eliminate all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its oil and gas production and reduce the methane intensity of operations by 50%. [Exxon Mobil](https://www.hartenergy.com/companies/exxon-mobil-corp) and [Chevron](https://www.hartenergy.com/companies/chevron-corp) followed suit with similar pledges.\nSince then, many in the basin’s energy industry have faced the electric vehicle owner’s nightmare: What happens if there’s no place to plug in?\nElectrification is a key factor in reducing GHG emissions. Operators sub out the diesel or gas-powered engines that typically drive operations, whether at a production site, a pump station or a processing facility.\nFar West Texas and southern New Mexico are among the most sparsely populated areas on the continent, and the states’ utilities built the electric grid to handle a smaller load.\nDrilling for and transporting oil, however, is an energy-intensive business. A large rig may need 3,000 hp to operate. Power demands for a single production field run into the hundreds of megawatts (MW). A crude pipeline pump station can consume 15 MW a day.\nWhile overall power demand is ramping up nationwide, the Permian’s electric utilities have started to ramp up their supply as well—though catching up is expected to take years.\nIn September, the Permian Basin Petroleum Association (PBPA) discussed the issue at a board meeting. Access to electricity is the biggest concern for the oil and gas industry in the area, Stephen Robertson, PBPA executive vice president, said in a local television interview.\n“If you look at West Texas, we are greatly underserved by the ERCOT [Electric Reliability Council of Texas] grid with electricity delivery and where that impacts greatly is not just prices for people buying electricity for homes and for businesses, but specifically out in the oil and gas industry,” Robertson said.\nLight at the site\nRPower is a Houston-based power company specializing in providing on-site electricity as a back-up, prime or bridge power while the operator waits for a utility plug-in.\nThe company has been busy in West Texas, said Ryan Rudnitzki, senior vice president of sales for energy. The electrification of the Permian kicked into high gear with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which instituted taxes on methane emissions. Much of the equipment at energy sites—drilling, gas processing and pipeline pump stations—has been powered by fossil fuels.\n“The kicker is, a lot of these locations are in very remote areas and it’s hard to get grid power to them, and that’s where we step up,” Rudnitzki said.\nMany oil and gas operations in the Permian faced a two-year wait for a connection to an electrical grid, according to a 2022 report from the Texas Public Utilities Commission. Rudnitzki says some clients now face twice the wait.\nA common construction timeline for a gas processing plant can be about 18 months.\n“It’s very common to hear (gas processing) customers say that the power company or the transmission company is telling them it might be three to four years or longer, depending on the location and how much congestion there is in the area,” he said.\nThe shortage of grid plug-ins has affected some of the largest players in the basin.\n[Enbridge](https://www.hartenergy.com/companies/enbridge-inc), one of North America’s largest midstream companies, confirmed that the region has been affected by the delays.\n“Given Enbridge’s extensive transportation pipeline and export assets, as well as continued interest in new growth across Texas and the U.S. Gulf Coast, we are always vigilant about the reliability and connectivity to the grid,” spokesman Michael Barnes told Oil and Gas Investor.\n“To date, some of our projects and facilities have been impacted by power availability and increased timelines for requests to connect to the electrical grid in the Permian. We have also been impacted by reliability issues at certain locations in the basin,” he said.\nThe company said that electrical infrastructure is a crucial part of a midstream system and will be needed especially as the Permian continues to grow at a frenetic pace.\n“As we assess all risks for new infrastructure, electrical power need is part of our long-term planning,” Barnes said. “We are working with our partners and providers on connectivity but recognize that demands on the grid continue to grow, and that current constraints could likely impact some timelines and projects.”\nOperators have some of the same options as they’ve always had with on-site generation: traditionally diesel-powered generators.\nRPower has taken a different approach and operates typically gas-powered, long-term generation facilities that can electrify a site on its own and provide backup in future power outages after the grid connection is available. The company can also sell power to deregulated grids like ERCOT, splitting revenues with the customer.\nThe Behemoth Behind the Meter\nThe decisions made at each power plant add up to a massive homemade power supply, said Dean Foreman, chief economist with the Texas Oil and Gas Association (TXOGA).\nPermian Basin operators were self-producing more than twice the electricity than they were getting from the grid, according to an S&P Global study in 2022. Today, the ratio is about the same, with operators producing about 12 GW on their own. One GW is enough to power about 750,000 homes.\n“A lot of these were temporary solutions, diesel generators behind the meter,” Foreman said. “They were meant to be put in place until ERCOT could expand both generation and transmission within the region, and months have become quarters, quarters have become years.”\nHistorically, ERCOT has been able to keep pace with the demand for growth, Foreman said. ERCOT is responsible for the Texas part of the Permian; the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) oversees New Mexico. However, once the basin’s production jumped in 2018, utilities started falling behind.\nOverall U.S. consumption of electricity had been flat since 2010. The Permian Basin, thanks to the rapid development of the shale plays, bucked the trend. By 2022, S&P Global noted an 8.3-GW gap between the electric load demand and available grid power.\nCongress passed the Inflation Reduction Act the same year, making electrification a priority. As users sought to meet the new GHG targets, the demand on the grid immediately rose by 50%, S&P reported.\nIn August, ERCOT’s Far West Texas region, which includes the Permian, saw its peak load rise by 20% from 2023, hitting 7.94 GW. Total demand is estimated to be more than double the available load, Foreman said.\nHigher voltage\nThe utilities in Texas and New Mexico are working overtime to catch up.\n“We’re seeing now, in the last year, load growth really ramping up. …And it represents oil and gas getting rid of those temporary solutions and coming back to the grid as more is available,” Foreman said.\nThe basin has seen several electrification success stories.\n[BPX Energy](https://www.hartenergy.com/companies/bpx-energy-inc) reported in early 2023 that a successful hook-up to the grid allowed the company to reduce flaring on BPX’s Permian assets from 16% to less than 1%. BPX is spending about $1.4 billion in infrastructure costs to update its production to almost complete electrification.\nThe energy industry and electric providers in New Mexico have both come forward with plans that will allow other companies to replicate BPX’s success.\nIn New Mexico, the SPP approved a $7.7 billion transmission plan to meet what the agency called “generational challenges” on its electrical grid. Among the list of projects is a 765-kilovolt power line connecting the southeast part of the state to available infrastructure in the Texas panhandle for “uniquely sharp load increases in New Mexico.”\nLast year, the Texas legislature approved House Bill 5066 to study the issue. In September, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) of Texas passed a regional electric reliability plan estimated to cost $13.8 billion over the next 13 years.\nERCOT will direct the building of new and upgraded transmission lines for the region to bring in power from other regions of the state. The buildout will attempt to meet the region’s demands up to 2038, when the PUC expects an additional 26 GW will be needed in the area.\nWhile oil and gas are the primary drivers of the grid expansion, commissioners have also taken into account the growing needs of artificial intelligence data centers and cryptocurrency operations, according to the plan.\nTodd Staples, TXOGA president, said in October that he hoped the public understood the immediate need to ship more electricity to the Permian.\n“A lot of times, folks hear things that are speculative, and what might happen; an ‘if-you-build-it-they-will-come’ type of thing,” Staples said. In the case of the Permian oil and gas industry, however, “they’re here.”\nRecommended Reading\n[Energy Transfer Confirms La Porte Fire, Report of 'Unknown' Vehicle](/exclusives/energy-transfer-confirms-la-porte-fire-report-unknown-vehicle-210434?source=Internal§ion=Popular&platform=reccoengine&article=/exclusives/energy-transfer-confirms-la-porte-fire-report-unknown-vehicle-210434)\n2024-09-16 - Energy Transfer acknowledged reports of a vehicle striking a valve on a natural gas liquids line, potentially leading to a large fire in La Porte, Texas, on the morning of Sept. 16.\n[Exclusive: MPLX's Liquid Lines Support Growing NGL Exports](/exclusives/exclusive-mplxs-liquid-lines-support-growing-ngl-exports-211136?source=Internal§ion=Popular&platform=reccoengine&article=/exclusives/exclusive-mplxs-liquid-lines-support-growing-ngl-exports-211136)\n2024-11-19 - MPLX Executive Vice President and COO Greg Floerke delves into the company evolution in Appalachia and the increase in its liquids exports and production scale, in this Hart Energy Exclusive interview.\n[Energy Transfer Leads the Midstream Consolidation Flow](/exclusives/energy-transfer-leads-midstream-consolidation-flow-210572?source=Internal§ion=Popular&platform=reccoengine&article=/exclusives/energy-transfer-leads-midstream-consolidation-flow-210572)\n2024-10-01 - Energy Transfer co-CEOs discuss pipeline pain points, needed M&A, regulatory woes and much more in this Midstream Business exclusive.\n[Finding a Niche: Midstream Giants Target Private G&P Assets](/exclusives/finding-niche-midstream-giants-target-private-gp-assets-210880?source=Internal§ion=Popular&platform=reccoengine&article=/exclusives/finding-niche-midstream-giants-target-private-gp-assets-210880)\n2024-10-23 - Smaller, non-publicly owned midstream companies are moving quickly for a position in a consolidation-driven market.\n[Private Midstream Executives: More M&A, More Demand, More Gas Pricing Woes](/exclusives/private-midstream-executives-more-ma-more-demand-more-gas-pricing-woes-210824?source=Internal§ion=Popular&platform=reccoengine&article=/exclusives/private-midstream-executives-more-ma-more-demand-more-gas-pricing-woes-210824)\n2024-10-17 - Private midstream CEOs discuss the growth, opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.\nComments\nAdd new comment\nThis conversation is moderated according to Hart Energy community rules.

    "text": "Marcelo ha sido, es y será uno de los mejores laterales de la historia del deporte rey. Pero sus inicios en el balompié estuvieron marcados por el 40x20. El brasileño no dio el salto al fútbol 'once' hasta los catorce años, tan sólo cuatro años antes de llegar al Real Madrid.\nAntes de su llegada a Chamartín y tras pasar por el fútbol sala, Marcelo fichó por Fluminense. Tres años, que le sirvieron para dar el salto al primer equipo del club brasileño con tan sólo 18 años. Una evolución meteórica que culminó con su aterrizaje en el Real Madrid. \" Fueron muy pocos años de fútbol once, sólo tenía el fútbol sala en mi mente todavía, pero con botas \", explicó el brasileño.\nPor eso hacía cosas que la gente decía que no podía hacer, porque el fútbol once es distinto\nMarcelo \" Por eso hacía cosas que la gente decía que no podía hacer porque el fútbol once es distinto. Empecé de delantero y poco a poco fui bajando hasta quedarme en la banda. Hacía regates diferentes y esto fue lo que vieron en el primer equipo, por eso me llamaron. En fútbol once para mí era mucho más fácil meter goles porque la portería era mucho más grande \", continuó Marcelo.\nENTRENAMENTO DEL REAL MADRID DUDEK, MARCELO. CODINA - 20080825 MARCA \" Con 18 vine al Real Madrid, es decir llegué con tan sólo cuatro años de fútbol once . Creo que el fútbol sala es la base de todo. Mucha gente no tiene la experiencia de lo que puede aportar un jugador con la base en el futsal. Te da el contacto con el balón y la visión de juego, hay jugadores que parece que tienen retrovisores y eso te lo da el fútbol sala porque allí no tienes espacios y si consigues hacer en fútbol once lo que haces en fútbol sala te sales. El fútbol sala me lo dio todo \", añadió el brasileño.\nSu 'rivalidad' con Roberto Carlos\nENTRENAMIENTO DEL REAL MADRID EN VALDEBEBAS MARCELO Y ROBERTO CARLOS SE RIEN - 20070616 DIEGO G. SOUTO \"Yo creo que no hay competición porque Roberto es lo mejor de la categoría, otro nivel. Para mí es, siempre lo digo, es un honor que la gente tenga la locura de preguntarse quién es mejor. Desde mi punto de vista, con la experiencia que tengo, Roberto ha sido mucho mejor y va a seguir siendo siempre el mejor de la historia para mí \", concluyó Marcelo.",

    "text": "<a href=\"https://www.pluggedin.com/tv-reviews/evil/\">\nEvil </a>\nParamount+’s faith-themed horror procedural trades its respectful roots for absurd and irreverent sensationalism.\nIt’s been a few years since Darius, Kenji, Sammy, Yaz, Ben and Brooklynn escaped the dinosaur-infested Isla Nublar, as chronicled in\nJurassic World: Camp Cretaceous.\nTheir survival was nothing short of spectacular. But now, dinosaurs don’t just roam a few islands off the shore of Costa Rica: They roam the whole planet.\nIn this neo-Jurassic Age (so dubbed by Dr. Ian Malcolm in\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom), animals and humans must coexist. And thanks to the Department of Prehistoric Wildlife (DPW), it’s not nearly as bad as you might expect. They keep the more dangerous dinos away from humans and relocate the creatures, when possible, to dinosaur reserves.\nUnfortunately, their efforts aren’t always successful. Although Darius (former employee of the DPW and paleontologist) and the rest of the Nublar Six kept in touch for a while, they all drifted apart after Brooklynn (who went into investigative journalism) was killed by a dinosaur during a job.\nDarius blames himself for Brooklynn’s death since he was supposed to meet her the night she died. But Ben isn’t so sure that Darius is at fault. Why did Brooklynn want to meet that night? How did a carnivore mysteriously show up in the middle of the city undetected? And why was the DPW so slow to respond?\nBen thinks Brooklynn was targeted. And while Darius is hesitant to accept this conspiracy theory, when man-eating dinosaurs start showing up at the homes of his fellow Camp Cretaceous survivors, even he can’t deny the suspicious circumstances.\nTheir only hope of survival is to get what remains of the Nublar Six back together, settle their differences, and do a little digging of their own to hopefully solve Brooklynn’s death.\nJurassic World: Chaos Theory is a continuation of Camp Cretaceous. And the show pretty much has all the same content concerns as before.\nAdults in Camp Cretaceous were rare, and most of them were corrupt individuals who had no problem abandoning helpless teenagers on an island filled with prehistoric dinosaurs. Darius and his friends are the adults now, but we still experience quite a bit of that corruption. And the show’s antagonists still have no quandaries with taking human lives.\nThe dinos have no problem killing people either. Some do it out of hunger, but at least a few have been trained to hunt humans by humans. As with Camp Cretaceous, these types of deaths typically occur offscreen, but there’s no doubt what’s happening.\nSammy and Yaz (both women) became a couple during Camp Cretaceous, even moving in together after escaping Isla Nublar. And they’re still a couple here. Brooklynn and Kenji were another couple from the previous show, but they split up just before Brooklynn’s death, leading to some very complicated feelings between foster brothers Kenji and Darius, since Kenji also blames Darius for Brooklynn’s death.\nAnd, of course, you can’t have a Jurassic World show without broaching the topic of cloning and gene manipulation, since that’s how the dinos were created to begin with.\nSo while Chaos Theory is certainly a more kid-friendly approach to ravenous, prehistoric dinosaurs (it certainly doesn’t spill as much blood as the live-action Jurassic World films), the LGBT content, dino creation and humans potentially serving as bite-size snacks may be unnavigable territory for some families.\n(Editor’s Note: Plugged In is rarely able to watch every episode of a given series for review.

Darius and Ben are attacked by three raptors. They use a net gun and stun baton to fend them off. Ben says he received several threatening messages after inquiring into Brooklynn’s death.\nMembers of the Department of Prehistoric Wildlife use tranquilizer guns to subdue a rampaging dinosaur. Before they fire, Darius notices the creature has barbed wire stuck in its foot, and he removes it, calming the dino. Because of his kindness, the herbivore defends them when a carnivore shows up. Darius chases the meat-eater down, but he’s stopped when his car blows a flat tire (which he kicks in frustration).\nA picture of the Nublar Six shows Sammy and Yaz holding hands.\nThere is an advertisement for a lawyer representing folks with dinosaur-related injuries. People lie. Darius teases Ben about conspiracy theories.\nEmily studied film and writing when she was in college. And when she isn’t being way too competitive while playing board games, she enjoys food, sleep, and geeking out with her husband indulging in their “nerdoms,” which is the collective fan cultures of everything they love, such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate and Lord of the Rings.\nParamount+’s faith-themed horror procedural trades its respectful roots for absurd and irreverent sensationalism.\nIf Yellowstone and Stranger Things had a baby, it might look a little like Outer Range.\nTires is a lemon that should be left to rust away.\nPeople from all walks of life learn lessons from God Himself that will change their lives.",
