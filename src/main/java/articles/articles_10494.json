    "text": "Principaux renseignements\n- Les travailleurs de l’usine Boeing votent sur l’opportunité d’une grève et d’un arrêt de la production d’avions.\n- La grève potentielle aurait un impact sur la production des avions les plus vendus tels que le 737 Max, le 777 et le 767.\n- Les travailleurs ne sont pas satisfaits de l’offre contractuelle en raison des augmentations de salaire insuffisantes et de l’absence de pensions traditionnelles.\nLes travailleurs de l’usine\nBoeing votent sur l’opportunité de faire grève et d’arrêter la production d’avions. Cette décision intervient après que les négociations entre l’Association internationale des machinistes et des travailleurs de l’aérospatiale (IAM) et Boeing n’ont pas abouti à un accord. La grève potentielle aurait un impact sur la production des avions les plus vendus de la société, notamment le 737 Max, le 777 et le 767.\nLe nouveau PDG de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, a tenté d’éviter une grève en exhortant les travailleurs à rester productifs. Toutefois, de nombreux machinistes ont exprimé leur mécontentement à l’égard de l’offre contractuelle, citant des augmentations de salaire insuffisantes et l’absence de rétablissement des pensions traditionnelles. Le salaire annuel moyen des machinistes passerait de 75 608 dollars à 106 350 dollars au cours des quatre années du contrat.\nNégociations et impact de la grève\nLe président de district de l’AIM a prédit que les travailleurs voteraient la grève malgré la recommandation du comité de négociation de ratifier l’accord. Le vote s’est déroulé dans des salles syndicales situées dans divers endroits de l’État de Washington et de l’Oregon. Le résultat du vote devait être annoncé plus tard dans la nuit.\nImplications financières et réputation\nUne grève\npotentielle aurait des conséquences financières importantes pour Boeing. La société a estimé qu’elle pourrait perdre jusqu’à 3,5 milliards de dollars de trésorerie en raison de l’impact sur les livraisons d’avions. La réputation de Boeing a été entachée par les récents problèmes de sécurité liés à l’avion 737 Max. L’entreprise fait l’objet d’un examen minutieux à la suite de plusieurs accidents et incidents impliquant l’avion. Si vous souhaitez accéder à tous les articles, abonnez-vous ici!",

    "title": "Sweden's Win Over Germany Sets Up Showdown With Canada - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "[NHL](../) Sweden’s Win Over Germany Sets Up Showdown With Canada The strong Swedish squad has joined Canada at the top of Group “A” with a win over the Germans. Sweden threw down a dominating [ performance in their first game](//thehockeywriters.com/sweden-takeaways-win-latvia-2024-wjc-december-26-2023/) of the 2024 World Junior Championship over Latvia and kept rolling against a German team that has already proven to be dangerous with a massive upset win over Finland on Dec. 27. Sweden must have used that opportunity to scout their opponent because they produced a much better performance against the underdogs, defeating them 5-0. The first period leaned heavily in Sweden’s favor, as the 18-6 shot differential showed, but Germany had managed to hold them off until Otto Stenberg collected his first goal of the tournament to make sure that they went into the first intermission up by one. The second period had some more good chances for Germany, but Sweden once again managed to collect a goal late in the period to put some distance between them, before finally putting the game away in third as Stenberg stayed hot and picked up a hat trick. Sweden’s Forward Depth is Fantastic Offensive depth was always going to be one of [ this team’s biggest assets](//thehockeywriters.com/2024-world-junior-championship-sweden-final-roster/), and while the lines are arranged slightly differently from what everyone thought they were going to be, all four lines have been good, with the top three being especially dynamic. The top line of Noah Ostlund, Anton Wahlberg, and Jonathan Lekkerimaki seemed like they generated a high-danger chance every single time they hit the ice, as is to be expected of three players of their skill level. They seem to favor rush plays and they are seriously dangerous no matter which one of them gets the break towards the net. Related: [2024 Guide to the World Junior Championship](//thehockeywriters.com/2024-world-junior-championship-guide/) Latest News & Highlights The second line of Filip Bystedt, Liam Ohgren, and Fabian Wagner are extremely efficient at transition and holding the offensive zone, as was the case in the second period when defenseman Mattias Havelid managed to rip one through traffic after extended zone time. [Their captain, Ohgren,](//thehockeynews.com/nhl/minnesota-wild/news/wild-prospect-liam-ohgren-to-captain-team-sweden-for-2024-world-junior-championship) may only have a single assist credited to him through two games, but he has been exceptional at winning puck battles and dancing around the opponent’s zone before ripping a shot on the net or setting up a teammate. It feels like only a matter of time before he breaks through. The slightly younger third line of David Edstrom, Stenberg, and Felix Unger Sorum was easily Sweden’s best line of the game as Stenberg, a first-round pick of the St. Louis Blues, collected the first goal of the game, then went on to score two more on his way to putting together an impressive hat-trick. Team Sweden should be in good hands next year with all three of these electric players able to return. Sweden’s Special Teams Stay Solid A team with excellent special teams can typically go a lot further in a short tournament when compared to a similar team that struggles in that department. So far, Sweden has been able to keep their power play hot as they collected another beautiful goal in third period to help put the game in the bag. The team was down a defenseman as Winnipeg Jets second round pick [Elias Salomonsson](//thehockeywriters.com/docs/elias-salomonsson/) was serving [a one game suspension](//www.dailyfaceoff.com/news/winnipeg-jets-prospect-elias-salomonsson-receives-one-game-suspension-from-world-junior-championship) he was assessed for a dangerous boarding play just 35 seconds into their game against Latvia. His five-minute penalty was completely killed — along with the four other penalties they took during that game — but the Swedes obviously realized they need to clean up their game a little bit as they were much more disciplined against Germany. They stayed perfect for the tournament and were only tested twice. Sign up for our NHL Prospects & Draft Substack newsletter The first kill came just six-and-a-half minutes into the game as Anton Johansson got extremely lucky to only get a minor penalty on a very similar boarding play to the one that got Salomonsson suspended. They obviously want to play a heavy, dominating type of game, but that style lends itself to collecting some ill-timed penalties that can kill hard-earned momentum and offer up perfect opportunities for opponents. The second was a critical kill after a penalty to Ohgren late in the second period gave Germany a great chance to tie the game at one. Options Appearing in Net One of the biggest questions about Sweden heading into the tournament was their goaltending. For the last few years, they have been privileged to have some elite prospective goaltenders like Calle Clang (Pittsburgh Penguins 2020 third-round pick), Jesper Wallstedt (Minnesota Wild 2021 first-round pick), and Carl Lindbom (Vegas Golden Knights 2021 seventh-round pick). That was not the case this year as they brought a brand new trio of netminders to hopefully hold the fort. [Hugo Havelid](//thehockeywriters.com/docs/hugo-havelid/), the undersized, undrafted 19-year-old appeared locked in as their starter after he posted a shutout against Latvia. As tonight’s game was the first game in a back-to-back with the second game being against Team Canada, it was a perfect opportunity to get Melker Thelin an opportunity in the net. Thelin, a fifth-round pick in 2023 [by the Arizona Coyotes](//thehockeynews.com/nhl/arizona-coyotes/news/coyotes-prospects-competing-at-world-junior-championship), has a much more typical frame for a goaltender at 6-foot-2 and 170 pounds, and he used it to show that perhaps Sweden has more options in net than people thought they would. Thelin was not subjected to a plethora of chances as the defence in front of him was good at limiting Germany to just 15 shots, but he was there when they needed him to be and also came away with a shutout. He had a massive save early in the second period to keep his team ahead 1-0 showing good positioning and even better reactions to a point-blank chance that could have altered the entire game. He definitely deserves another opportunity at some point in the tournament to show off his skills. Difficulty Ramps Up Drastically The Swedes are rolling with two wins and zero goals against, but they are looking at a much more difficult task for their next game as they will take on Team Canada in less than 24 hours. Both teams [are tied with six points](//www.iihf.com/en/events/2024/wm20/standings/group) at the top of Group “A” and the winner of that game could very well decide which team will sit atop the Group when the time comes to move into the elimination rounds. With the way both teams are rolling right now, we are in for what will likely be the best game of the preliminary rounds as the two heavyweights go at it.

    "text": "Sachin Tendulkar pin-points major cause for India's heavy loss vs South Africa in 1st Test: ‘From whatever I watched…’ Team India went down without a fight during the second innings, facing an innings-and-32-run defeat to the Proteas in the first Test. Plagued by pace and unsettled by the unexpected bounce, an ill-prepared India faced a heavy defeat – by an innings and 32 runs – against a vastly superior South Africa in the opening Boxing Day Test in Centurion, concluding within three days. After posting a fighting total of 245 in the first innings, the Indian batters faltered in the second innings, managing only 131 runs in 34.1 overs. In contrast, South Africa posted a commanding 408 in their initial attempt. With this, South Africa secured an insurmountable 1-0 lead in the two-match series, shattering India's aspirations of winning a Test series in the Rainbow Nation for the first time in 31 years. The only chance for redemption now lies in a 1-1 draw, contingent on India leveling the series in the upcoming New Year's Test in Cape Town. The Indian team put up a shoddy batting show, signifying its cluelessness and lack of preparedness for a tough assignment like this. Former India batter and cricketing legend [Sachin Tendulkar](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/players/sachin-tendulkar-2962) insisted the side's performances left “much to be desired,” emphasising on batting shortcomings.

While I initially felt the South African team would’ve been unhappy after the 1st innings, their pace attack surpassed expectations and showcased remarkable skill in the 2nd innings, in spite of the pitch becoming more favourable for batting as the match progressed. “From whatever I watched, India's shot selection left much to be desired. Throughout the Test, only a few batters, namely Elgar, Jansen, Bedingham, @imVkohli and @klrahul truly seemed at ease with the bat, navigating the conditions with technique and poise,” wrote Tendulkar. It has been a horrible last six to seven weeks for skipper Rohit Sharma, who lost the World Cup final in November, was removed from Mumbai Indians captaincy two weeks back and now didn't look like a leader that made him an instant favourite during the World Cup. The team also looked a bit like its skipper, dishevelled and without any plan B for course correction.

A winter weather system bringing snow, high winds, and sub-zero temperatures has wreaked havoc on a large section of the county in front of the holidays. Strong winds are expected to combine with sub-zero temperatures tomorrow driving the wind chill in Chicago to around -40 degrees. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) By Kff Health News PUBLISHED: June 6, 2024 at 5:16 p.m. | UPDATED: June 6, 2024 at 5:19 p.m. By Vanessa G. Sánchez, KFF Health News\nLOS ANGELES — The party was winding down. Its young hosts, María Rivas Cruz and her fiancé, Raymond Olivares, had accompanied friends to their car to bid them farewell. As the couple crossed a four-lane main road back to the home they had just bought, Rivas Cruz and Olivares were struck by a car fleeing an illegal street race. The driver was going 70 in a 40-mph zone.\nDespite years of pleading for a two-lane road, lower speed limits, safety islands, and more marked crosswalks, residents say the county had done little to address speeding in this unincorporated pocket of southeastern Los Angeles. Since 2012, this half-mile stretch of Avalon Boulevard had logged 396 crashes, injuring 170 and killing three.\nOlivares, 27, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, became the fourth fatality when he was hurled across the street, hit by a second car, and instantly killed. Rivas Cruz was transported to a hospital, where she remained in a coma for two weeks. Once awake, the elementary school teacher underwent a series of reconstructive surgeries to repair her arm, jaw, and legs.\nIn the aftermath of the February 2023 crash, the county installed protective steel posts midway across the street. But residents, who had sought a platformed center divider and speed cameras, said that wasn’t enough.\n“It’s just a band-aid on a cut. This is supposed to solve it, but it doesn’t, and that is what hurts,” said Rivas Cruz, who now at age 28 walks with a cane and lives with chronic pain. “I go to sleep, and I’m like, ‘It’s just a dream, it’s just a dream.’ And it’s not.”\nThe nation’s road system covers 4 million miles and is governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local jurisdictions that often operate in silos, making systemic change difficult and expensive. But amid the highest number of pedestrians killed in decades, localities are pushing to control how speed limits are set and for more accountability on road design. This spring, New York and Michigan passed laws allowing local jurisdictions to lower speed limits. In Los Angeles, voters approved a measure that forces the city to act on its own safety improvement plan , mandating that the car-loving metropolis redesign streets, add bike lanes, and protect cyclists, transit riders, and pedestrians.\nStill, there’s plenty of political resistance to speed enforcement. In California’s Statehouse, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) proposed requiring GPS-equipped smart devices in new cars and trucks to prevent excessive speeding. But after pushback, the state lawmaker watered down his bill to require all vehicles sold in the state starting in 2032 to have only warning systems that alert drivers when they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph.\nAlthough the Biden administration is championing Vision Zero — its commitment to zero traffic deaths — and injecting more than $20 billion in funding for transportation safety programs through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , road safety advocates and some lawmakers argue that the country is still far from making streets and vehicles safe, or slowing drivers down.\n“We are not showing the political will to use the proven safety tools that exist,” said Leah Shahum, founder of Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit organization advancing Vision Zero in communities across the country.\nStill a crisis The need for safer roads took on urgency during the covid pandemic. Fatalities rose even as lockdown mandates emptied streets. In 2022 , more than 42,500 people died on American roads, and at least 7,522 pedestrians were fatally struck — the highest tally of pedestrian deaths in more than four decades.\nExperts cite several reasons for the decline in road safety. During the lockdowns, reckless driving increased while traffic enforcement declined. SUVs and trucks have become larger and heavier, thus deadlier when they hit a pedestrian. Other factors persist as streets remain wide to accommodate vehicles, and in some states speed limits have gradually increased .\nEarly estimates of motor vehicle fatalities show a slight decrease from 2022 to 2023, but pedestrian fatalities are still notably above pre-pandemic numbers . “It’s an encouraging start, but the numbers still constitute a crisis,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote in February of roadway deaths.\nThe Biden administration has directed $15.6 billion to road safety until 2026 and $5 billion in local grants to prevent roadway deaths and injuries. Under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s new “ vulnerable road user” rule , states with 15% or more deaths involving pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists compared with all road deaths must match federal dollars in their safety improvement spending.\nRoad safety advocates argue the federal government missed an opportunity to eliminate outdated standards for setting speed limits when it revised traffic guidelines last year . The agency could have eliminated guidance recommending setting speed limits at or below how fast 85% of drivers travel on uncongested roads. Critics contend that what’s known as the 85th percentile rule encourages traffic engineers to set speed limits at levels unsafe for pedestrians.\nBut the Federal Highway Administration wrote in a statement that while the 85th percentile is the typical method, engineers rarely rely solely on this rule. It also noted that states and some local agencies have their own criteria for setting speed limits.\nIn response, grassroots efforts to curtail speeding have sprouted across communities. In April, Michigan passed legislation granting local governments authority to round down when setting speed limits.\nAnd after four years of lobbying, New York state passed Sammy’s Law, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, who was killed by a driver in Brooklyn in 2013. The law, which will take effect in June, allows New York City to lower its speed limits to 20 mph in designated areas.\n“With this legislation, I hope we can learn more children’s names because of their accomplishments, their personalities, and their spirit — not their final moments,” said Sammy’s mother, Amy Cohen.\nPush for pedestrian safety Advocates would also like the federal government to factor in pedestrian safety on the five-star vehicle safety rating scale. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed a separate pass/fail test that would be posted only on the agency’s website, not on labels consumers would see at the dealership.\nRelated Articles National Politics | Hollywood’s A-listers are lining up behind Joe Biden.

According to the campaign finance site Open Secrets, automakers spent about $49 million lobbying in 2023 compared with $2.2 million spent by advocates for highway and auto safety.\n“The federal government has the biggest punch when it comes to requiring improved vehicle safety design,” said Wiener, the California state lawmaker.\nAlthough Wiener modified his proposal to restrict excessive speeding, he has advanced companion legislation that would require Caltrans, the state transportation agency, to make improvements such as adding crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better serve pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.\nWhen that bill was heard in a committee, opponents, including engineering firms and contractors, cautioned it would remove flexibility and hamper the state’s ability to deliver a safe and efficient transportation system. Lawmakers have until Aug. 31 to act on his bills.\nIn Los Angeles, hope for change arrived in March when voters passed Measure HLA , which requires the city to invest $3.1 billion in road safety over the next decade. Rivas Cruz’s house, however, sits eight blocks outside the jurisdiction of the city initiative.\nIt’s been more than a year since the crash, but Rivas Cruz finds reminders everywhere: in the mirror, when she looks at the scars left on her face after several surgeries. When she walks on the street that still lacks the infrastructure that would have protected her and Raymond.\nStories of pedestrians killed in this Latino working-class neighborhood are too common, said Rivas Cruz. In September, she attended a memorial of a 14-year-old who was killed by a reckless driver.\n“There’s so much death going on,” the Los Angeles Unified School District teacher said from her mother’s living room on a spring afternoon. “The representatives have failed us. Raymond and I were giving back to the community. He was a civil engineer working for the city, and I’m a LAUSD teacher.
