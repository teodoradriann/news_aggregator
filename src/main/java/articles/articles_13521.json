    "title": "The personal life of Íñigo Errejón: his controversies, his relationship with Rita Maestre and his political divorce from Pablo Iglesias",
    "text": "Íñigo Errejón has resigned this Thursday, October 24, through a statement on X, formerly Twitter, after two thirty in the afternoon. Sumar’s until then spokesperson in Congress thus leaves his seat in the Congress of Deputies and retires from politics.\nIn the statement, the politician indicates having reached “the limit of the contradiction between the character and the person. Between a neoliberal way of life and being a spokesperson for a formation that defends a new world. Furthermore, he has alluded to “patriarchy” and «psychological support process» in which he has been immersed for “some time”.\nAt the moment Sumar has communicated that a information gathering process about some rumors that had emerged about Errejón’s sexist behavior with some girls, most of them spread through social networks.\n«I announce thus, as I have already communicated to my colleagues in charge, my resignation as spokesperson for the Plurinational Parliamentary Group of Sumar, I leave the seat in Congress and all my political responsibilities,” explained the former deputy on his Twitter account.\nAfter his resignation, it remains to be seen what the suspicions about the former deputy take shape, of whom we review his personal and private career since he entered the political arena.\nÍñigo Errejón and some controversial beginnings in politics\nBorn in Madrid on December 14, 40 years ago, Errejón has a doctorate in Political Sciences from the Complutense University of Madrid. Errejón was one of the best-known faces of the 15M movement and one of the few who had resisted until now in politics.\nHe was one of the founders of Podemos and managed to become a deputy in Congress and later move away from the purple formation. He moved to Manuela Carmen’s Más Madrid, which later became Más País, a party with which he was also a deputy.\nIn the 2023 elections, the Errejón party joined an electoral coalition with Add . He was again elected as a deputy and became spokesperson in the plenary session for said party since January of this year.\nThroughout this career of more than a decade in politics, there have been several controversies that have surrounded the political scientist. One was known as the ‘black scholarship’, that the politician would have received from the University of Malaga, for which he received 1,800 euros per month without going to school and carrying out work lacking solid research. He was filed and disqualified.\nAnother of his most notable controversies was related to an incident for which he was accused of having kicked you in the stomach to a man in May 2021 in Lavapiés (Madrid). The plaintiff claimed that, when jokingly asking the politician for a photo, he kicked him.\nErrejón denied these accusations and stated that the man was very insistent and annoying, that he grabbed him by the neck to pose for a ‘selfie’, so he got rid of him without any type of aggression. After going through trial, Justice acquitted Errejón .\nRelationship with Rita Maestre and other relationships\nRegarding his personal life, there is no evidence that he maintains any romantic relationship formal today. However, in his past some have transcended, such as those he has had with colleagues in the world of politics.\nThe most striking was Rita Maestre now councilor of the Madrid City Council with Más Madrid. It is said that they had an affair with her for several years, since they began the relationship in 2011 and ended it in 2015, after many comings and goings. One of the proofs were the words that Errejón dedicated to her in his thesis: «Rita knows by heart, despite herself, this thesis, the reflections, questions and hours that are behind this work. I would say that it has the unparalleled merit of having endured me in times of anxiety and, perhaps even more so, in times of good wind. However, that happens in the course of sharing the days in handfuls, like desire, war and hands. AND that would be irreplaceable to me », according to ‘La Razón’.\nAfter this long courtship, Errejón began a new relationship, this time with LaSexta journalist, Glòria Mena whom he met in 2015 but whose romance did not become official until 2019, the year in which they could be seen together on a romantic getaway outside of Madrid. Love also ended in this case and the last girlfriend that the politician would have known would be Mireia Vehí, a CUP deputy in Barcelona, ​​although they would also have ended a romantic relationship in 2023 that was never confirmed.\nThe ‘political divorce’ of Pablo Iglesias\nThe year 2019 It should have been a celebration for Podemos, a party founded, among others, by Pablo Iglesias and Íñigo Errejón, because it was celebrating five years since its inclusion in the Spanish political landscape. However, during the months before the people of Madrid chose their new president, a bucket of cold water fell on the purple formation.\nPablo Iglesias was Podemos’s main candidate to occupy the presidency of the Community of Madrid but, by surprise for him and the majority of his party, your trusted man Íñigo Errejón, gave him a ‘stab’ in the back, by running with Manuela Carmen’s platform for the regional elections and leaving Podemos and, therefore, Iglesias behind. This represented an unprecedented schism, in which Errejón proposed that Podemos, IU and Equo be integrated into his list with Más Madrid, something they did not consider and, in the end, competed among themselves.\nWith what happened, as told by ABC Iglesias shared a statement in which He admitted feeling “touched” and “sad” for Errejón’s decision to start a “new personal political project” together with the then mayor of Madrid, Manuela Carmena, also regretting that they hid it from him, something that he implied was a betrayal:\n«I can’t believe that Manuela and Íñigo they have hidden us who were preparing to launch their own electoral project for the Community of Madrid and who announced it by surprise. “I think our registrants deserve more respect,” wrote Pablo Iglesias, who also resigned and walked away from politics in May 2021.\n#personal #life #Íñigo #Errejón #controversies #relationship #Rita #Maestre #political #divorce #Pablo #Iglesias",

You too were naked, stripped of your clothes. You too were sick and wounded; on the cross, you too were thirsty and hungered for love,\" he added.\n The Pope also reflects on the \"women of Jerusalem\", who \"have no voice, yet they make their presence felt\".\n \"Help us to recognize the dignity of those women who remained faithful and stood by you in your passion, and those who in our own day are exploited and endure injustice and indignity,\" he says.\n In his closing invocations the pope also prays for all those who are suffering persecution and war.\n \"May this prayer of intercession embrace our brothers and sisters who in so many parts of the world are suffering persecution on account of your name; those who experience the trauma of war, and all those who look to you for the strength to bear their heavy crosses,\" says Francis.",

    "text": "|\nSupport\nContact\nPowered by\n|\nBiden: You Know, the Ukrainians Will Probably Have to Cede Territory to Russia to End This War\nVia\nWith U.S. and European aid to Ukraine now in serious jeopardy, the Biden administration and European officials are quietly shifting their focus from supporting Ukraine's goal of total victory over Russia to improving its position in an eventual negotiation to end the war, according to a Biden administration official and a European diplomat based in Washington.

His knee-jerk reaction - and he has no other kind - was that the Russians have to be stopped.\nThat really is a lot of it, I think. Many Boomers and Silents especially. The Cold War is all they know.

I think in many ways this honour is a recognition of the countless late nights chipping away behind the scenes to try and lobby the Government for change.\n“My only hope is that with this honour I am able to continue to drive home that message to get changes that are needed.”\nMasood, a British-born convert to Islam, drove along a pavement on Westminster Bridge, killing four pedestrians, and then stabbed a police officer to death outside Parliament.\nThe attacker was shot dead at the scene.\nLives were torn apart by “82 seconds of high and terrible drama” in the attack, an inquest into the deaths was told.\nMr Frain told the PA news agency: “If I am going to think about the incident – and I will remember it for many, many years to come – I want to be able to look back with not just the negativity of what happened that day and the impact it had on me and my family.\nFlowers left on Westminster Bridge in London on the fourth anniversary of the terror attack (Aaron Chown/PA) “I want to look back with a sense of pride and to know I have done everything in the years since then to make something positive out of something so negative, to try and help other people who have been affected by terrorism but also to try and prevent future attacks.”\nThis has included campaigning for the rights of terror victims to improved support from the state while also trying to prevent future attacks.\nMr Frain campaigned for a plaque to be installed on Westminster Bridge in memory of those affected, goes into schools and colleges to share his experience and has run educational workshops.\nHe created the Resilience in Unity Project in 2021, which records the testimonies of people affected by terror attacks in a bid to prevent people being radicalised.\nHe is also a member of the advisory boards of Counter Terrorism Policing and charities including the National Emergencies Trust.\nMr Frain was a politics and history student on a trip Whitehall when he was stuck by the car driven by Masood.\nTravis Frain (James Manning/PA) Mr Frain, who was closest to the road, took the brunt of the impact.\n“I went over the bonnet and hit the windshield. I was thrown into the air before landing back down on the concrete,” he said.\nHis left leg was fractured in two places and metal and glass from the car caused a deep laceration in his leg, missing an artery by about an inch.\nAll four fingers on his left hand were broken and he had a range of cuts, bruises and other minor injuries across his body.\nHe spent eight days in hospital and had two operations, and one of his visitors was the King, who was then the Prince of Wales.\nMr Frain said: “I spent about six months on crutches, followed by having to use a walking stick and then had about two years of physiotherapy.\nThe then Prince of Wales visited Travis Frain in hospital after the Westminster terror attack (Angela Frain/PA) “The one thing I had a hell of a lot of during that period was literally time.\n“I just felt that what I had experienced had changed my mindset and made me realise there was a lot of work that needs to be done in this area to try and counter extremism and try to prevent these attacks from happening in the future.\n“I figured that if there was something, however small, I could do to contribute then I absolutely should do it once I was back in full working order.”\nMr Frain described himself as “immensely proud and humbled” by the OBE which he hopes may “shine a light” on the dedication of thousands of people around the country trying to counter violence and extremism.\nHe said: “At the end of the day we are all trying to prevent future terror attacks. There are a lot of people out there who may not have a story like mine but may be working behind the scenes and will never get recognition.\n“We had a lot of attacks in this country in 2017, the year I became a victim of terrorism.\n“We often hear that lessons will be learned. You would hope those lessons are being learned but I think it is still important that we bang the drum about why changes and improvement are necessary.\n“Since the pandemic young people are increasingly being exposed to extremist content, often online but also since coming out of the lockdowns.\n“I think it is really concerning, not just the speed but also the scale of the radicalisation.”",
