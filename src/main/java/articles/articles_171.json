    "text": "‘Incorrect translation’: Assam CM Himanta Sarma apologises after his post on Vaishyas, Shudras triggers row\nTwo days after his social media post on “Swabhabik Karma” or “natural duties” of Vaishyas and Shudras triggered a row, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday apologised for the post and deleted it saying that one of his team members had posted a verse from the Bhagavad Gita with an “incorrect translation”.\nSarma also sought to emphasise that Assam has a “casteless society” due to the social reforms spearheaded by Shrimant Sankardeva, who is considered a major spiritual leader in the state.\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, chief minister Sarma wrote, “As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas. Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation. As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. The state of Assam reflects a perfect picture of a casteless society, thanks to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva…”.\n“…If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,” he added.\nOn December 26, the BJP leader had posted a verse on his X handle which can be translated as follows, “Bhagwan Shri Krishna himself describes the natural duties of Vaishya and Shudras”. Sarma had also posted a video citing the 44th verse from ‘Sanyas Jog’ in the 18th chapter of the Gita. The video explains that agriculture, cow rearing and business are the “natural duties” of Vaishyas, while serving Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the “natural duty” of Shudras.\nSharply criticising the post, the CPI(M) shared a screenshot of it and wrote, “We strongly denounce Assam CM Himanta Biswas tweet claiming that “Shudras are to serve Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas”.\nIn its post on X, the Communist party also slammed the chief minister’s statement, calling it “BJPs Manuvadi ideology in full play”.\nMeanwhile, Sarma put up another verse from the Gita on Friday in continuation of his daily posts from the Hindu scripture.\nFor the latest news from across India, Political updates, Explainers, Sports News, Opinion, Entertainment Updates and more Top News, visit Indian Express.

    "text": "LEWISTON, Idaho — On Saturday, thousands of anglers will take to Minnesota lakes for the annual fishing opener.\nTheir sights are set on walleye, the state fish and easily the most popular, but there are statewide daily bag limits.\nKARE 11's Jennifer Hoff visited a place where walleye are all you can catch, anywhere, anytime — if you're willing to go there.\nWelcome to Lewiston, Idaho, located in the North Central region, known for being the state's only port city and the gateway to Hells Canyon. The Snake River runs through the canyon that's more than 100 miles long and 7,993 feet from its highest rim to the river below.\nIdaho Department of Fish and Game Conservation Officer John McLain has long patrolled these parts that are particularly popular for fishing salmon and steelhead.\n\"Two summers ago, about 50 miles upstream, I checked a 25\" walleye that a guy had,\" said McLain. \"When he was holding it up, I thought it must have been a catfish because it was so big.\"\nWalleyes that big would make any Minnesota angler envious.\nExcept, the favorite fish is anything but in Idaho, as they continue to move upstream. Fish and Game is asking anyone who catches a walleye to kill it, take a photo and contact state biologist Marika Dobos.\n\"I think they're big, toothy predators,\" said Dobos. \"There are these areas where they’re keying in on the food that’s available to them and I think that if that continues to happen, we’ll see more problems and more predation.\"\nDobos says walleyes aren't bad, they're just wrong for Idaho, where it's not the whitefish, but salmon, that reign supreme.\n\"We have spring and summer Chinook, we have fall Chinook, we have Coho, so it's busy,\" said Dobos. \"That’s why we’re here and that’s why this is such a hot topic.\"\nSalmon have significant recreational, cultural and economic importance, bringing in a billion dollars every year. But the species is being threatened, some say, due to rising water temperatures, declining habitat and dams.\n\"When you have those anomalies that we can't control, you're taking a small population that's already depressed and then you're just adding more factors to it, that's further affecting them in a negative way,\" said Dobos about the salmon, that swim several local rivers to reach the Pacific Ocean and back to spawn.\nDobos says walleye are making that long, treacherous journey more difficult as they keep migrating further down river.\nAnglers are catching some in Lewiston, but even more at Lower Granite Dam, which is some 60 miles away. It's where Dobos is trapping the fish and tracking their activity.\n\"Up until 2016, we haven't caught any walleye at the trap and from 2016, we've seen nothing but this exponential increase in walleye,\" said Dobos.\nThe fish was never meant to be here in the first place. It was illegally introduced in Oregon by so-called \"bucket biologists\" about 70 years ago. The invasive species is now an apex predator that has a penchant for none other than juvenile salmon.\n\"They're sitting in places where there's a lot of food available,\" said Dobos. \"These are areas where these juvenile fish are rearing and just trying to survive the winter and get big enough so they can migrate out and that's part of why we reach out to the angling community to get that support from people, to get the help from anglers and the buy-in that these are bad things and we're going to do our part to remove them.\"\nDobos is asking anglers to not release them back to the river alive and instead, enjoy a very tasty dinner.\n\"Part of our fear is that the folks that know about walleye and want that opportunity are going to get the word out that they’re moving into these areas and they’re going to capitalize on that,\" said Dobos.\nAt North 40 Outfitters in Lewiston, there's an aisle dedicated to walleye fishing gear.\n\"We've expanded it a lot in the last two years just because walleye has gotten so popular,\" said former guide turned salesman John Snaza.\nHe has long fished for walleye and says the booming business shows no signs of stopping.\n\"I don’t think they’d do too much damage below Lower Granite (Dam) and that’s why I think it’d be great for them to stay,\" said Snaza. \"If a person wants to walleye fish, you go down there and if you want to salmon fish, you come up here, and I think that’d be perfect if we could regulate that somehow.\"\nExcept, Dobos admits angler harvest is not an ideal tool for removing a fish species. She says the department also has a proposal to allow spear fishing in select waters to support the message that they want them removed.\nDobos and McLain are undoubtedly caught up in what has become a complicated relationship between Minnesota's most revered fish and the salmon it's putting at risk — whose value is as vast as the Idaho landscape they both now live in.\n\"The fact that we have people reporting walleye caught here, when there's so few people up here, is pretty mind-boggling and that's the struggle,\" said Dobos.\nThere are three reservoirs where Fish and Game have allowed some walleye fishing. The department has been extremely selective and limits it only to Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir, Onieda Reservoir, and Oakley Reservoir.",

[PTI](/pti-stories)| Bengaluru | Updated: 29-12-2023 15:08 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 15:06 IST - Country: - India The Save Sharda Committee (SSC) here on Friday sought the help of the Indian government to remove the ''encroachment by the Pakistan Army'' on the Sharda temple premises in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK), in order to pave way for its restoration. Addressing a press conference at Press Club of Bangalore, SSC founder Ravinder Pandita alleged that the Pakistan army had encroached upon the dilapidated old Sharda temple premises and opened a coffee home there despite a court order in the committee's favour. “Save Sharda Committee requests the Government of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to raise the issue of encroachments and removal of a coffee home recently erected on Sharda Peeth premises by the Pakistan army. This is despite the Supreme Court of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir’s landmark judgment on January 3, 2023 pronounced in favour of Save Sharda Committee based on its representation seeking to stop encroachments,” he said. He added that civil society in PoK has also raised their voice in tandem with SSC on this issue as well as about the damages to the boundary wall. Pandita demanded that Sharda Peeth be reopened for devotees to go on pilgrimage. ''We will give a call for a march to the LoC and cross it if the coffee home is not removed by Pakistan authorities and its army. All Sharda supporters should be ready for this march in the near future,'' he said. He also called for Sharda Peeth to be declared a UNESCO heritage site. The SSC founder told reporters that a website has been launched with the aim of providing complete information and a travel guide for pilgrims and tourists on the newly reconstructed Sharda temple at Teetwal and a Sikh gurudwara that stood at the same place before 1947 but was burnt down in tribal raids. The construction of the new Sharda Yatra Temple at Teetwal in Kashmir, which was virtually inaugurated on March 22 by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, was supported by the Dakshinamnaya Sringeri Mutt in Karnataka. Teetwal, where the temple has been built now, was the historic base camp for devotees who would go to Goddess Sharda's shrine before partition, according to reports. Nearly 10,000 pilgrims have visited the new Sharda Yatra temple and gurudwara since its inauguration in March this year.
