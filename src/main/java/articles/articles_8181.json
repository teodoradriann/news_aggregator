    "title": "In praise of Barbara Lee, a truly courageous voice for peace in an era of perpetual war",
    "text": "True, genuine courage is rare among politicians. They’ll declare themselves brave for having done the predictable.\nThis is not the case for Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, whose signature political stand over her long career was no doubt her truly brave stand just days after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on our nation.\nAs genuinely mournful as the rest of us in that terrible time, Lee nevertheless saw what most were not able or willing to see. In response to the Sept. 11 attacks, something of course had to be done. But what was put forward for a vote was a blank check for the executive branch to wage war, which Lee understood was the wrong response.\nAnd so, Lee stood as the lone member of Congress to vote against the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force.\n“However difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint,” she said on the House floor. “Our country is in a state of mourning. Some of us must say, let’s step back for a moment. Let’s just pause, just for a minute and think through the implications of our actions today, so that this does not spiral out of control.”\nShe continued, “Now I have agonized over this vote. But I came to grips with it today, and I came to grips with opposing this resolution during the very painful, yet very beautiful memorial service. As a member of the clergy so eloquently said, ‘As we act, let us not become the evil that we deplore.’”\nDeath threats and vicious attacks on her character followed, yet she stood firm on her principles. And in the end, she was right.\nAccording to the Costs of War project out of Brown University, the 2001 AUMF has been invoked to justify military operations in at least 22 countries. It was also invoked to justify unconstitutional surveillance of the American people by the federal government. And it would be only the beginning of a long, costly and deadly campaign of military interventions around the world.\nAccording to the Costs of War project, “Over 940,000 people have died in the post-9/11 wars due to direct war violence.” Millions more are estimated to have lost their lives due to the indirect impacts of war, including economic devastation and environmental contamination. Many millions of people were displaced or forced to flee their countries entirely. And on top of al that, this came at a cost of roughly $8 trillion spent or obligated to cover the long-term costs of war.\nBarbara Lee, in the decades since her bold 2001 vote, has been a consistent and powerful voice for peace. And, notably, an advocate of returning decision-making about war to Congress, as the constitution demands.\nLee has been willing to speak up and speak out regardless of who is president. This included the Obama years, when the Obama administration chose to escalate tensions in the Middle East with ill-fated interventions in Yemen, Libya and Syria.\n“We must learn the lessons of the past. Lessons from Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and others,” she warned in 2013. “We must recognize that what happens in Syria does not stay in Syria; the implications for the region are dire. This letter is calling for a specific action: debate. Congress has a vital role in this process and constitutional power that must be respected. The American people are demanding this debate before we commit our military, our money, or our forces to Syria.”\nThis approach is one she righteously maintains to this day. Just two months ago, this newspaper was pleased to run an\n[op-ed](/2024/01/11/barbara-lee-if-we-learned-anything-from-the-disastrous-war-on-terror-nows-the-time-to-show-it/) from Lee making the case for restraint, diplomacy and peace in Gaza.\n“It is our responsibility as the United States to wield our power and vast wealth to support our common humanity,” she wrote. “In this case, that means upholding international law, providing critical aid to Palestinians, supporting negotiations for the freedom of hostages, and helping to advance a political and diplomatic solution that allows Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side with security and peace.”\nThough she came up short in her run for U.S. Senate, these pages will always remember her truly courageous and righteous stand for peace and diplomacy during a time of perpetual war.",

    "title": "Roman Catholic High Alum Dom Colasante Gifts $500K, Boosting Scholarships in Philadelphia",
    "text": "PHILADELPHIA -- In a heartwarming act of philanthropy, Dom Colasante, a South Philadelphia native and Roman Catholic High School graduate, has generously donated over $500,000 to his alma mater. This significant contribution was made through the Business Leadership Organized for Catholic Schools (BLOCS), marking a milestone in the organization's history of supporting education in the Philadelphia region.\nEmpowering Future Generations\nColasante's donation is set to provide substantial support for Roman Catholic High School's educational initiatives and scholarship programs. BLOCS, the largest scholarship organization in the state, will manage these funds, aiming to distribute approximately 17,000 scholarships to deserving students across Philadelphia. This generous act reflects Colasante's deep appreciation for the education he received and his desire to give back to the community that shaped his success.\nA Celebrated Return\nThe donation ceremony was a reunion of sorts, with Colasante's former teacher, Pat Shanahan, in attendance. Shanahan, who also hails from South Philly, reminisced about Colasante as a standout student with a keen eagerness to learn. The event was further highlighted by the presence of Roman Catholic basketball senior guard Kabe Goss, fresh off a game-winning shot that clinched the Philadelphia Catholic League championship for his team. Goss's achievement, alongside Colasante's donation, underscored the day's theme of extraordinary accomplishments within the Roman Catholic community.\nA Legacy of Giving\nDuring his time at Roman Catholic High School, Colasante benefited from student aid, which he credits as instrumental in his journey to becoming the founder and CEO of B2B marketing firm 2X. His donation through BLOCS not only honors his personal history but also strengthens the fabric of the school's future. By supporting educational opportunities for current and prospective students, Colasante's contribution is poised to inspire a new generation of leaders, thinkers, and achievers.\nThe impact of Dom Colasante's generosity extends beyond the immediate financial assistance it provides. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of community support and the profound difference one individual can make in the lives of many. As Roman Catholic High School and its students move forward, they do so with enhanced resources to pursue academic excellence and personal growth, thanks to the legacy of giving embodied by alumni like Colasante.",

    "text": "SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash. – As communities across Washington state continue to face affordability crises, the state's annual cost-of-living adjustment to its minimum wage seeks to offer respite in the New Year.\nBut owners of some Spokane area businesses say the new minimum wage will force them to make some adjustments, and even threaten the sustainability of their operations.\nGage Lang, the owner of Breaüxdoo Bakery in Spokane Valley, says that since opening three years ago, 2023 was the worst year yet.\n“We almost closed several times,” said Lang.\nWith the state-wide minimum wage set to increase on Jan. 1, 2024, small businesses like Breaüxdoo Bakery will have to cough up a lot more dough.\n\"Everything skyrockets, so really nobody's making more you're just spending more.\"\nThe state minimum wage is set to increase to $16.28 an hour, a ¢.54 increase from 2023. It's part of an annual process of minimum wage increases set by the Washington Department of Labor and Industries that began with a law passed in 2019.\nLang says it costs him $62,000 a month, all expenses included, to run his business, and although he wants to give his employees a livable wage, he now has to change the way he runs his business.\n\"We're now getting into machinery to lower that labor cost and to, you know, stretch that margin,” Lang said.\nLang added that since opening his business, he has had to increase prices yearly, and customers sometimes have a sour response to the cost of their sweet treats.\n\"Customers do come in here and complain about the prices – nobody wants to spend $6 on a cookie,” Lang said.\nAlthough there may be a rocky road ahead, he is ready to weather the storm.\n\"We're just going to hang on tight,\" Lang said. \"I've got a really good team that has put up the fight with me, so we just keep marching for given our all.\"",

    "text": "Sobrarbe-Pirineos revalida la distinción de Geoparque Mundial para cuatro años más Un comité examinador visitó la comarca en julio de 2023 para evaluar el trabajo que se está haciendo. La [Unesco](https://www.heraldo.es/tags/instituciones_empresas/unesco.html) ha revalidado la distinción de Sobrarbe-Pirineos como Geoparque hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2027, con el voto unánime de todos los miembros, resaltando que ha logrado \"avances impresionantes\" y que hoy es un geoparque bien gestionado, que sólo necesita armonizar aún más las diferentes acciones que ha emprendido. Además, destacó su compromiso educativo. El Geoparque Mundial Unesco Sobrarbe-Pirineos ha pasado un riguroso examen para comprobar la calidad de las infraestructuras y de los servicios. En julio de 2023, y durante cuatro intensos días, el comité evaluador recorrió todo el territorio para revisar que se mantienen los estándares de calidad que se exigen. Dos evaluadoras del servicio geológico británico y del Geoparque Karawanken/Karavanke de Eslovenia y Austria visitaron Sobrarbe acompañadas por los gestores y técnicos del Geoparque Sobrarbe-Pirineos. Sobrarbe cuenta con esta figura desde el año 2006 y esta es la quinta renovación de la distinción que otorga la Unesco. Para llegar hasta aquí ha sido imprescindible la colaboración de todos los actores del territorio. \"Los que trabajan por mejorar el espacio y ayudar a su difusión y conocimiento, al público que asiste de manera masiva a todas las acciones que se organizan, a las entidades colaboradoras del Geoparque y a administraciones públicas y asociaciones privadas que lo apoyan\", agradecen. En cuanto a posibles mejoras que se pueden introducir para fortalecer el Geoparque y alcanzar los objetivos que plantea la Unesco, los evaluadores que visitaron el territorio proponen seguir trabajando en un enfoque coherente para la señalización junto con otras organizaciones del territorio, para mejorar su visibilidad. Con este mismo fin proponen trabajar en coordinación con otras entidades como por ejemplo, los museos locales. El Geoparque comienza este periodo de revalidación 2024-2027 con energías renovadas y nuevos programas y proyectos que ayudarán a cumplir los objetivos que marca la Unesco y que consolidarán sus infraestructuras, geo recursos y las numerosas actividades de formación, divulgación e investigación que programa anualmente. Durante este año se ha puesto en marcha del Plan de Sostenibilidad turística de Sobrarbe “Sobrarbe-Pirineos 365”, concedido a la Comarca al gestionar un territorio que coincide plenamente con un espacio natural protegido, en este caso un geoparque. En este PSTD se contemplan algunas actuaciones que van a reforzar directamente las líneas de trabajo del Geoparque en cuanto a la potenciación del ecoturismo, la creación de nuevas geo rutas, la gestión de paneles interpretativos, la edición de una guía geológica o la edición de materiales promocionales, entre otras.

    "title": "Over 60 international, domestic flights face delays owing to low visibility",
    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 29 : Over the past few days, dense fog has engulfed the city, especially in the mornings. A layer of fog blanketed the national capital and its adjoining areas even on Friday morning with moderate to dense fog in isolated pockets of Delhi. Visibility is likely to improve over the day and the minimum temperature recorded stands at 10.7 degrees Celsius -- four notches above the season's average, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. \"Dense to very dense fog conditions are very likely to continue during night/morning hours in many parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and some parts of Uttar Pradesh during Thursday night till Saturday (December 30) morning and in some parts for subsequent three days,\" said the IMD. The IMD classifies fog intensity into four types -- shallow, moderate, dense and very dense fog. The visibility ranges from 999m to 500m, 499m to 200m, 199m to 50m and < 50m, respectively. Delhi's Palam station recorded 150m and Safdarjung 200m visibility, according to IMD. As the day unfolds, the fog is forecasted to gradually dissipate, revealing a clearer atmosphere by the afternoon. Flight and train schedules are also being affected, with many flights experiencing delays and some possibly facing cancellations. Over 60 international and domestic flights arrival and departure faced delays, owing to low visibility. In a fog-induced challenge for commuters, several trains arriving in the Delhi region are also dealing with delays, causing frustration among passengers. Delhi's air quality remained in the 'severe' category. The AQI scale categories levels from 0 to 500, with Anand Vihar breaching the 'severe' threshold. At the Anand Vihar area, PM2.5 levels remained into the 'severe' category standing at 473 and PM10 reached 447, and CO plummeted to 107, classified as 'moderate', according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The Air Quality Index (AQI) between zero and 50 is considered 'good'; 51 and 100 'satisfactory'; 101 and 200 'moderate'; 201 and 300 'poor'; 301 and 400 'very poor'; and 401 and 500 'severe'. The Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport T3 witnessed PM2.5 levels at 425 and PM10 at 405, both falling under the 'severe' category. The CO level was recorded at 104, maintaining a 'moderate' rating.",

    "title": "7 ideas para dar gracias a Dios por un año nuevo",
    "text": "Cerca de recibir el Año Nuevo, es momento de mirar atrás y dar gracias a Dios por todas las bendiciones que hemos recibido. Estas ideas te pueden ayudar a agradecer a Jesús por todo lo que nos ha entregado este año. En un artículo del [Semanario Desde la Fe,](https://desdelafe.mx/noticias/sabias-que/dar-gracias-a-dios-por-ano-nuevo/) la periodista Tannya Jaime indicó que dar gracias a Dios por un nuevo año permite “ponerlo en el centro de nuestras vidas” y reconocer que todo lo que tenemos se lo debemos a Él. “Comenzar el Año Nuevo con gratitud por las bendiciones recibidas, nos recuerda que [Dios]está con nosotros siempre y su amor es tan grande, que Él nos sostiene ante los desafíos”, agregó. Jaime enumeró 7 ideas para dar gracias a Dios por este nuevo año y por las bendiciones que hemos recibido. 1. Oración personal Dedica tiempo a la oración personal. Habla con Dios directamente, expresando tus pensamientos, emociones y agradecimientos por el año pasado, pidiendo Su guía y bendiciones para el año que comienza. 2. Enciende una vela Puedes encender una vela, reflexionar, escribir tus agradecimientos y tus intenciones para el nuevo año en tu diario de oración. 3. Ayuno Considera la posibilidad de dedicar tiempo al ayuno como una expresión de humildad y búsqueda de la guía divina. 4.

    "text": "How’s your English, hacker? , there's a 78% chance you’re located in a non-native country, meaning English probably isn't your mother tongue. If you find yourself struggling to express thoughts in this language, understand others, get your points across, and find time and motivation to upgrade, you're not alone. According to Similarweb Been there, done that, and managed to sort out the issue; I've got something valuable to share with you. Below, I'll tell you how I boosted my English speaking skills using a helpful yet lesser-known I now work for, along with other AI tools and methods like my grandma which have nothing to do with ML but are still effective. English learning app Contents: I. The Backstory: My Journey to Improve My English II. Exploring AI Speech Analyzer Pronounce III. My Approach: How I Use Pronounce, Other Tools, and Achievements IV. Unlocking Native English: Why AI-Language Assistants Are Game-Changers Personal experience, tips, product description, and more are waiting for you below ⬇️⬇️⬇️ I. The Backstory: My Journey to Improve My English 1. Why I Needed to Work on My Language Hello, hackers! I'm Veronika, a marketing and product prof, and a non-native English speaker. While I've been using English at work for years, it was primarily in non-native regions like the Middle East (shoutout to Dubai folks reading this!). A few years back, I entertained the idea of exploring the US market, but that required elevating my language proficiency. The challenge was compounded upon returning home, resulting in less practice and my English regressing. 2. The Motivation Problem As my language proficiency declined, the mission seemed impossible. I might never have mustered the motivation to tackle it head-on, but then, out of the blue, I was approached about a dream opening. Despite possessing all the required skills, language proficiency became the stumbling block, forcing me to decline the offer. Surprisingly, that rejection served as the push I needed, and I finally decided to take action to improve my English. 3. What I Tried To dig out my fluency, Americanize pronunciation, and improve comprehension and vocabulary, I immersed myself in American English content across various channels, formats, and aspects of life. And replaced reading with watching. 4. Why It Didn't Boost My Speaking Skills This approach improved all my language skills except speaking because it failed to provide the necessary practice for work-related topics and, more crucially, lacked professional feedback on my speech. Unfortunately, I saw no viable options for obtaining that: 👎 Speaking clubs offered conversations with and . non-natives no valuable feedback 👎 Tutors were either or sky-high-priced for my third-world salary at the time. unfamiliar with business topics 👎 Friends were more interested in casual chatting than teaching (again, ). no feedback While studying the old-fashioned way, the folks from Pronounce came across my profile and offered me the job I wanted. However, what impressed me even more was that they were building just the right product for my needs. II. Exploring AI Speech Analyzer Pronounce is an English learning app focused on spoken communication. It's a grammar, fluency, and pronunciation checker that helps master the skills necessary for talking, understanding, and being understood. Pronounce Those having speaking practice can progress with nearly zero time spent studying: simply record calls or meetings, review the reports, and work on correcting mistakes ( ). Those lacking real-life conversations can practice using the app. no motivation or time required!! because they can analyze the practice you already have.

As throughout the product, we provide both default cases and the option to create your own. III. My Approach: How I Use Pronounce, Other Tools, and Achievements 1. How I Use Pronounce 📞 Record My Speech I record all my calls, meetings, and voice messages to friends — everything in which I speak English. 📖 Read Aloud When I need to prepare a speech (e.g., a product demo), I add the text to the app and read it aloud. If you need to prepare any speech, start by reading it aloud. If your pronunciation is far from perfect, speech analyzers, like people, can misunderstand some of your words or phrases. By providing the AI with the copy, you give yourself proper feedback. If you don’t know how to pronounce some words, voice them with AI first. For example, Pronounce has a for that purpose. Chrome extension I always begin by reading my speeches aloud and switch to recording only when I get nothing more than minor corrections. 🤖 Speak with Bots When I have no one to talk to in a spare moment, I say, \"Hey Blake/Jenny…,\" and discuss work, books, movies, the weather — whatever I want. Siri Even 5 (!) minutes of practice a day can lead to progress. 🏋️♂️ Do Personalized Exercises Frankly, much less than I should. Non-repetitive pronunciation mistakes I often skip, for instance. 2. What Else I Do Keep Watching and Reading Content in English Ever wanted to give up binge-watching? I’ve got a solution for you! Simply start rewinding every single moment you didn’t get and write down every new word or phrase — and voila, you hate watching Netflix more than visiting dentists! 😄 Well, the above is how I began. Nowadays, I still get back to unclear moments and take screenshots, but not always. After several months of dedicated learning, I’ve realized that, in the long run, I need my productive habits to be enjoyable. Otherwise, I find myself skipping them. Don't push yourself too hard; otherwise, you might end up procrastinating due to excessive pressure. Keep your learning enjoyable! Check All My Writing and Speeches by Grammarly Primarily to check grammar and vocabulary. Its paraphrasing could be better, so, for that purpose, I prefer ChatGPT (see below). Based on my experience, Grammarly excels at finding errors but may not capture non-nativeness or paraphrases effectively. I’d recommend using it primarily for the first purpose. ❗️ Like generative AI tools, sometimes it may make mistakes! From my observations, the longer the copy, the higher the chances it will miss something. Double-check my Writing and Speeches by ChatGPT I haven’t found anything better than ChatGPT (even the free version is fine) for checking the naturalness of language. It also provides quite good alternative wording. From my experience, the prompt doesn’t matter much, while the subsequent tuning does (btw, the OpenAI showed the same result). So I use super simple prompts like the following one and keep guiding the model. study . Check if the following is written in correct American English and appears native. Can be informal, but it’s fine. If it doesn’t meet any requirements, suggest what to correct and how 3. My Results After several months of non-regular use of the tools mentioned above, I’ve experienced the following results: Better Grammar and Pronunciation, Bigger vocabulary Now, about 97% of my speech is grammatically correct, well-pronounced, and filled with the right words. At the starting line, only 85-90% was so, and I spoke like in the screenshot (🙈😂). Better Listening Comprehension I haven’t tried to evaluate it, but I see significant progress. I usually face difficulty in understanding only when I come across unfamiliar words. I also capture errors in my pronunciation much better. More Native Speech I don’t have proof for this, but my speech is undoubtedly getting more native. Have you noticed any unnatural wording while reading this article? I speak quite the same way. Pronounce, Grammarly, and ChatGPT guide me in formulating my thoughts better. I add new phrases to my personal dictionary on Pronounce, revisit them from time to time, and incorporate them into my speech. Only after several months with AI, I realized how unnatural my language was. And . No human will analyze every sentence you write and say and come up with the most significant feedback. I doubt that anyone can get a clear understanding of their language proficiency without AI IV. Unlocking Native English: Why AI-Language Assistants Are Game-Changers Let me summarize: Almost if you have some practice in the language you want to learn. no extra time is required writing, speaking, voicing, translating, etc. There are AI tools for pretty much anything you may need : The use of writing fixers and chatbots has already become the norm. Speech analyzers and speech bots are equally useful, just less known. Speech bots are incredibly useful for improving auditory comprehension and vocabulary. IMO, only AI can give you a clear understanding of your language level. Disagree? Have questions? Or anything to share? Please let me know in the comments or in . I've tried to make this article useful and would love to hear your feedback; that's my purpose in engaging with communities. Any reaction will be greatly appreciated!!
