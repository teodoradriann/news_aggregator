    "text": "Lou’s drinking creates a problem for the whole family when Shantel goes looking for justice. Kanan assimilates into Ronnie’s crew, and Raq formulates a new plan for Unique’s former heroin operation.\nThis week’s episode started with Paul getting a very unpleasant surprise in the form of Ronnie and some of his goons. While he was watching TV, they busted into his house and roughed him up a bit before taking him to Kanan. Kanan explained to Paul that he and Ronnie didn’t like the stuff he was talking about going to the police. While this is happening, Famous unknowingly walks in. As soon as he peeps the scene, he offers to leave and come back and get his stuff another day. Ronnie tells him that he can stay. Before they leave, Ronnie makes sure that Paul (who had pissed himself out of fear at this point) understands that saying he was going to go to the cops was even worse than doing it. After Paul clearly got the message, Ronnie and Kanan walked him to his apartment. Kanan told Famous to get his stuff and be gone by the time he got back. Elsewhere, Raq made her way to discuss business with Quân. She wanted to keep the same deal with him that Unique had. Quân told her about Unique’s plan to expand and how he had trouble doing it, especially with the transportation aspect. He didn’t think the spot Unique had was worth all the trouble. Raq was able to convince him to work with her on pretty much a 2 month probational period. Back at the spot, Fanous quickly packed his stuff in his bag, including his gun. As he was trying to speed out, Kanan and Ronnie were coming back in. Ronnie started to grill Famous with a whole bunch of questions while Kanan sat by and watched. Ronnie went on to share how Kanan told him that Famous likes to talk. Famous denied the allegations and told Ronnie he didn’t have anything to worry about. Ronnie took offense and got very close as if he was going to harm Famous. Kanan had to step in and tell Ronnie that Famous keeps things close for the most part and if he didn’t, he’s handle him himself.\n1. Intercepting The InterrogationSource:Starz\n2.

    "title": "Scientists discover first nitrogen-fixing organelle",
    "text": "Modern biology textbooks assert that only bacteria can take nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into a form that is usable for life. Plants that fix nitrogen, such as legumes, do so by harboring symbiotic bacteria in root nodules. But a recent discovery upends that rule.\nModern biology textbooks assert that only bacteria can take nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into a form that is usable for life. Plants that fix nitrogen, such as legumes, do so by harboring symbiotic bacteria in root nodules. But a recent discovery upends that rule.\nIn two recent papers, an international team of scientists describe the first known nitrogen-fixing organelle within a eukaryotic cell. The organelle is the fourth example in history of primary endosymbiosis — the process by which a prokaryotic cell is engulfed by a eukaryotic cell and evolves beyond symbiosis into an organelle.\n“It’s very rare that organelles arise from these types of things,” said Tyler Coale, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Santa Cruz and first author on one of two recent papers. “The first time we think it happened, it gave rise to all complex life. Everything more complicated than a bacterial cell owes its existence to that event,” he said, referring to the origins of the mitochondria. “A billion years ago or so, it happened again with the chloroplast, and that gave us plants,” Coale said.\nThe third known instance involves a microbe similar to a chloroplast. The newest discovery is the first example of a nitrogen-fixing organelle, which the researchers are calling a nitroplast.\nA decades-long mystery The discovery of the organelle involved a bit of luck and decades of work. In 1998, Jonathan Zehr, a UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of marine sciences, found a short DNA sequence of what appeared to be from an unknown nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium in Pacific Ocean seawater. Zehr and colleagues spent years studying the mystery organism, which they called UCYN-A.\nAt the same time, Kyoko Hagino, a paleontologist at Kochi University in Japan, was painstakingly trying to culture a marine alga. It turned out to be the host organism for UCYN-A. It took her over 300 sampling expeditions and more than a decade, but Hagino eventually successfully grew the alga in culture, allowing other researchers to begin studying UCYN-A and its marine alga host together in the lab.\nFor years, the scientists considered UCYN-A an endosymbiont that was closely associated with an alga. But the two recent papers suggest that UCYN-A has co-evolved with its host past symbiosis and now fits criteria for an organelle.\nOrganelle origins In a paper published in Cell in March, Zehr and colleagues from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Institut de Ciències del Mar in Barcelona and the University of Rhode Island show that the size ratio between UCYN-A and their algal hosts is similar across different species of the marine haptophyte algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii .\nThe researchers use a model to demonstrate that the growth of the host cell and UCYN-A are controlled by the exchange of nutrients. Their metabolisms are linked. This synchronization in growth rates led the researchers to call UCYN-A “organelle-like.”\n“That’s exactly what happens with organelles,” said Zehr. “If you look at the mitochondria and the chloroplast, it’s the same thing: they scale with the cell.”\nBut the scientists did not confidently call UCYN-A an organelle until confirming other lines of evidence. In the cover article of the journal Science , published today, Zehr, Coale, Kendra Turk-Kubo and Wing Kwan Esther Mak from UC Santa Cruz, and collaborators from the University of California, San Francisco, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, National Taiwan Ocean University, and Kochi University in Japan show that UCYN-A imports proteins from its host cells.\n“That’s one of the hallmarks of something moving from an endosymbiont to an organelle,” said Zehr. “They start throwing away pieces of DNA, and their genomes get smaller and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell for those gene products — or the protein itself — to be transported into the cell.”\nTyler Coale worked on the proteomics for the study. He compared the proteins found within isolated UCYN-A with those found in the entire algal host cell. He found that the host cell makes proteins and labels them with a specific amino acid sequence, which tells the cell to send them to the nitroplast. The nitroplast then imports the proteins and uses them. Coale identified the function of some of the proteins, and they fill gaps in certain pathways within UCYN-A.\n“It’s kind of like this magical jigsaw puzzle that actually fits together and works,” said Zehr.\nIn the same paper, researchers from UCSF show that UCYN-A replicates in synchrony with the alga cell and is inherited like other organelles.\nChanging perspectives These independent lines of evidence leave little doubt that UCYN-A has surpassed the role of a symbiont. And while mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved billions of years ago, the nitroplast appears to have evolved about 100 million years ago, providing scientists with a new, more recent perspective on organellogenesis.\nThe organelle also provides insight into ocean ecosystems. All organisms need nitrogen in a biologically usable form, and UCYN-A is globally important for its ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Researchers have found it everywhere from the tropics to the Arctic Ocean, and it fixes a significant amount of nitrogen.\n“It’s not just another player,” said Zehr.\nThe discovery also has the potential to change agriculture. The ability to synthesize ammonia fertilizers from atmospheric nitrogen allowed agriculture — and the world population — to take off in the early 20th century. Known as the Haber-Bosch process, it makes possible about 50% of the world’s food production. It also creates enormous amounts of carbon dioxide: about 1.4% of global emissions come from the process. For decades, researchers have tried to figure out a way to incorporate natural nitrogen fixation into agriculture.\n“This system is a new perspective on nitrogen fixation, and it might provide clues into how such an organelle could be engineered into crop plants,” said Coale.\nBut plenty of questions about UCYN-A and its algal host remain unanswered. The researchers plan to delve deeper into how UCYN-A and the alga operate and study different strains.\nKendra Turk-Kubo, an assistant professor at UC Santa Cruz, will continue the research in her new lab. Zehr expects scientists will find other organisms with evolutionary stories similar to UCYN-A, but as the first of its kind, this discovery is one for the textbooks.",

No Santuário Estadual Nossa Senhora Perpétuo Socorro, as cerimônias começaram às 5h.\nJá na paróquia São João Bosco, que fica na região central, as celebrações começaram às 7h e tem toda uma programação ao longo do dia com novena da divina misericórdia, encenação da via sacra e celebração da paixão de Cristo.\nAntes mesmo da paróquia abrir, a Cleunisse Maria já aguardava na calçada. Ela, que frequenta a paróquia desde 1991, contou que acordou cedo na expectativa e vem se preparando desde o início da quaresma, fez a via sacra toda sexta feira, e caminhadas como procissão, que eram projetos da igreja.\n(Nathalia Alcântara, Midiamax) “Além de dar uma certa tristeza em lembrar do sofrimento que ele teve para carregar as custas dos nossos pecados e angústias, é também um dia de celebrar o que Jesus fez para salvar a humanidade. Dia de exercitar e crescer na fé”, afirma.\nO pároco, Wagner Roberto da Silva, explica que A Sexta-feira Santa faz parte do Tríduo Pacal, sexta-feira, sábado e domingo, que é a paixão, morte e ressurreição de Cristo. ‘É a data mais importante para o cristianismo, até mesmo, mais que o Natal. Resume-se na passagem desta vida terrena para a espiritual”, disse.\nWagner ainda lembra que é época de servir a Cristo. “A quaresma foi uma escola de oração. Houve uma preparação em relação a orações, jejum, pertinência, reflexão da ida e momento de repensar em falas, pensamentos, omissões, transformar o que não está legal para o mundo para que haja um desenvolvimento espiritual”.\n(Nathalia Alcântara, Midiamax)",

    "text": "La Alcaldía de Bucaramanga busca construir la vía que busca acabar con los ‘trancones’ de la calle 56 y darle una nueva alternativa de movilidad a la Ciudadela Real de Minas.\nPor cerca de 15 años la obra del Par Vial de la 54 y 55 ha estado en pausa. Sin embargo, el proyecto fue radicado nuevamente ante el Concejo de Bucaramanga.\nDe acuerdo con el jefe de la Oficina de Valorización de Bucaramanga, Jairo Jaimes Yañez, “en 2023 la UIS actualizó los estudios de esta obra de acuerdo con las necesidades de movilidad de la zona”. Lea también: Denuncian falta de apoyo del Gobierno Nacional para superar crisis de Metrolínea\nJaimes Yañez agregó que, según el estudio, se deben declarar 104 predios como de utilidad pública para construir el Par Vial. Para que esto sea posible, el Concejo deberá aprobar que dichos predios tengan la mencionada declaratoria.\nActualmente, se designaron dos concejales ponentes y el proyecto se encuentra en estudio. Se espera que durante la última semana de abril se debata la propuesta en comisión y en plenaria del cabildo.\nDe aprobarse la iniciativa, el paso siguiente es la inscripción de los 104 predios, como de utilidad pública, ante el catastro e iniciar el proceso de gestión predial. Le puede interesar: Futuro de Metrolínea en manos de un juez: ¿será finalmente liquidada?\nLa Alcaldía de Bucaramanga cuenta con cerca de $16.000 millones para adelantar la mencionada compra de predios, recursos que fueron obtenidos hace algunos años a través de un impuesto por valorización. Sin embargo, este cobro se viene realizando a morosos, concepto que, a la fecha, está en cerca de $22.000 millones.\nAl respecto, el jefe de la Oficina de Valorización de Bucaramanga, Jairo Jaimes Yañez, la obra está planteada en dos fases, “una de la 15 hacia arriba y otra de la 15 hacia bajo. La vía conectaría la vía antigua del Mutis y terminaría donde actualmente se encuentra el Restaurante Dimarco”. Vea además: ‘Jalón’ de orejas a Invías por el “pésimo estado” de algunas vías de Santander\nEl funcionario aclaró que los recursos faltantes para compra de predios y ejecución de obra se adelantarían por medio de un empréstito. No se descarta hacer gestión ante el Gobierno Nacional para solicitar recursos.\nSe estima que la obra de infraestructura costaría más de $100.000 millones.",

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nEn España hay más de medio millón de personas trabajando en el sector del empleo del hogar y cuidados, el país con más empleados en ... este ámbito de la Unión Europea. De ellas, el 87% son mujeres y un 70% es de nacionalidad extranjera o doble nacionalidad. Los datos, extraídos del informe 'Trabajo invisible y cuerpos rotos' publicado por Oxfam Intermón constatan que el empleo del hogar es un sector «esencial» pero «profundamente precarizado» en España.\nLos sueldos medios apenas alcanzan los 1.000 euros al mes, por lo que el 38% de las trabajadoras en este sector declaran tener problemas severos para llegar a fin de mes. El 32% de ellas no están dadas de alta en la Seguridad Social, «lo que limita su acceso a derechos laborales como la cotización por desempleo y las prestaciones correspondientes», advierten desde Oxfam. Además, el 24% de los contratos en el sector son temporales y un 59% de las trabajadoras tienen jornadas parciales, factores que contribuyen a la inestabilidad y la pobreza laboral.\nLa falta de protección laboral es otra de las preocupaciones: solo cuatro de cada diez trabajadores reciben la indemnización por despido que les corresponde, las enfermedades profesionales no están reconocidas, no son posibles las inspecciones laborales en el lugar de trabajo y no siempre se cumplen las horas de jornada y los descansos pactados, indica el informe.\n«Muchas de esas mujeres se ven obligadas a trabajar en régimen de interna haciendo jornadas infinitas y sin tener apenas horas de descanso o días libres, se encuentran solas y sin red familiar que las apoye», dice Nerea Boneta, autora del informe y experta en empleo de hogar y cuidados de Oxfam Intermón. «No son reconocidas ni atendidas por la administración pública, se les niegan derechos tan básicos como el derecho a paro con carácter retroactivo», denuncia.\nAdemás, la ONG indica que estas precarias condiciones laborales impactan directamente en la salud de las trabajadoras del hogar. La encuesta revela que el 91% de ellas han sufrido dolores musculoesqueléticos en el último año, el 66% han experimentado estrés y el 59% ansiedad. En un 74% de los casos necesitan consumir habitualmente analgésicos para afrontar sus jornadas laborales.\nPor todo ello, Oxfam Intermón subraya la urgencia de establecer un sistema público y universal de cuidados que garantice plenos derechos a los trabajadores del sector. Entre las medidas planteadas, en colaboración con organizaciones de trabajadores del hogar y cuidados, destacan la equiparación en la indemnización por despido, el control estricto de los límites de la jornada laboral, el reconocimiento de las horas extraordinarias y el derecho a desempleo con carácter retroactivo.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?
