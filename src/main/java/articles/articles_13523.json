    "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has called on Inspector-General of Police Olukayode Egbetokun to expedite efforts towards the arrest and prosecution of Hudu Yunusa-Ari, the suspended INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Adamawa.\nPDP’s national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, made the call at a news conference on Thursday in Abuja, saying that arresting and prosecuting Yunusa-Yari would be in obedience to court order.\nYunusa-Ari was suspended over an attempt to usurp the powers of the state returning officer when he declared the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Aishatu Binani, the winner of the April 15, 2023 Adamawa governorship election.\nAt the point of the declaration, the compilation of the election results was incomplete.\nOlogunagba described the action as a civilian coup and an attempt to subvert Nigeria’s constitutional democracy.\nThe High Court of Justice of Adamawa State, No. 9, Yola Division, has issued a warrant of arrest against Yunusa-Ari, dated May 21, 2024.\nThe court ordered the IGP to apprehend and produce Yunusa-Ari to appear before it to answer to the charges preferred against him.\nThe order of court was received at the office of the IGP on May 23.\nOlogunagba said that since his removal, Yunusa-Ari has been on the run, forgetting the saying that “time does not run against the state in criminal matters.”\nHe, however, said that the delay in the prompt and diligent prosecution of Yunusa-Ari constitutes a clear and present danger to Nigeria’s democracy and the rule of law.\n“The failure of the Nigerian police so far to apprehend and bring Yunusa-Ari to justice is capable of creating bad precedence and encouraging other public officers to act with impunity.\n“There is a tendency for them to behave as if there are no consequences for acts contrary to the law and their oath of office,” he said.\nPDP charged the Inspector General of Police to, in compliance with the order of the court, immediately fish out, arrest and bring Yunusa-Ari before the court for prosecution.\n“This is especially urgent as there are allegations and apprehensions in the public space that Yunusa-Ari has perfected plans to escape from the country and evade trial.\n“The PDP insists that Yunusa-Ari must be made to face the full wrath of the law for his assault against our democracy,” he said.",

    "title": "Alumnus from US finds school in shambles, announces annual aid of Rs 10 lakh for 10 yrs | Chandigarh News - The Indian Express",
    "text": "When ex- Sainik School student Anurag Kumar returned from the US after 33 years, he was pained to see his alma mater’s infrastructure, which was in shambles. A son of a teacher of the only Sainik School of Punjab in Kapurthala, Anurag cleared the NDA and IIT both in the same year in 1977, but chose to pursue the latter and moved to the US. On a visit to Sainik School in Kapurthala after 33 years with his daughter this month, Anurag, a senior executive in a software firm in US, has now pledged to donate Rs 1 crore – Rs 10 lakh every year for ten years. Anurag was the first student from the school who got admitted into IIT and later built a career in the US, where he currently resides. While speaking to [The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com) over call from US, Anurag said his daughter, Mala, wanted to visit his school and that is how he came to Kapurthala. He further said that he has not been inside his school since 1990. “I was casually walking the campus and the main building, and they were not in the same shape as I remembered when I grew up. I lived there from 1966 to 1982. The back of the campus required significant improvement. I used to play badminton during my years and there was no badminton court today, I used to play tennis and there was no tennis court today,” Anurag elaborated. While speaking to the principal, vice-principal and other senior teachers, Anurag said, he got to know that securing funding to run the school was a major issue as there was not enough support from the government. “And that is when I immediately decided to support by school, to whom I owed so much of my success. I decided to give the school Rs 10 lakh every year for the next ten years,” he added, Not just when he went back to the US, he contacted two other alumni of the school, Inderpreet Singh Dhillon and Rajesh Bajaj, both successful doctors in the US, and they too have agreed to match his donation. “I am so excited for the school as other alumini here have also agreed to contribute,” Anurag said. During his schooling at Sainik School, Anurag stayed on the campus itself as his father, SN Agrawal was the head of Chemistry department there. “I have grown up in this school, I learnt so much there, and this is the least I can do. That year in 1977, I had cleared the NDA and IIT both, and I chose the latter. I did my IIT from [Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/) and then went to the US to pursue my career” he said. While in the US, Anurag started five technology companies but wasn’t successful every time. He kept trying, something he learnt from his teachers and the military education, that “you never give up” and “perseverance pays”. The software firm which he started in 2010 was then bought by a known firm in 2020 and now Anurag is a senior executive there. Currently, he presides as the managing director and president of Improving Austin offices. Prior to this, Anurag was the co-founder and CEO of iTexico, established in 2010, which was acquired by Improving in 2020. He has been a founder, president and CEO of several other US and international firms over the years as well as holding a variety of leadership development/ coaching CEO roles for the Austin Business Board and Vistage, a global business coaching and advising firm. Anurag stated that here in India, there wasn’t any system by schools to reach out to alumni as they can help a lot in raising funds for the school. “Here in India, schools do not have a system of reaching out to the alumni and then raising funds, the way it is abroad. Had I known earlier, I would have got back quite before to help the school. I am just hoping to connect to the other alumni to try and seek more help for the school,” he said. Anurag said that he just wanted to give back a bit to the school. “I just want to give back a little to the school who helped me reach here. I thought if my help can help make a difference,” he said. A teacher at the school told The Indian Express, requesting anonymity, that this school was the only Sainik School of Punjab opened in 1961 and the state of affairs is such that they are somehow managing to run it in the absence of any help from the government.”",

SUSCRÍBETE VER MÁS SECCIONES Diario QueTal Negocios Salud Ciencia y Tecnología Autos y Motos Moda y belleza Cultura y entretenimiento Viajes y Gastronomía Estilo de vida local Hay anomalías y posibles delitos en entrega-recepción de ayuntamientos Plano Informativo | 24/10/2024 | 14:37 San Luis Potosí, SLP.- El titular del Instituto de Fiscalización Superior del Estado, Rodrigo Joaquín Lecourtois López, señaló que en el caso de la Entrega – Recepción, el plazo legal de 30 días hábiles posteriores al Acto Protocolario sigue su curso y las autoridades entrantes están en tiempo de notificar irregularidades a sus Contralorías Internas, con la finalidad de que éstas emitan las acciones correspondientes. Agregó que a la fecha el Instituto ha recibido reportes de anomalías en los municipios de San Vicente Tancuayalab, Axtla de Terrazas, Cedral y Villa de Pozos, donde presuntamente ocurrieron incluso hechos con apariencia de delito, siendo los dos primeros Ayuntamientos en los que se han presentado los casos más graves. En San Vicente Tancuayalab, los ex funcionarios formatearon todos los equipos de cómputo y las nuevas autoridades se vieron ante la imposibilidad de funcionar administrativamente, sin datos ni para pagar la nómina. “Los actuales funcionarios se acercaron a nosotros y les dimos un respaldo de la información que resguardamos, con el fin de que tuvieran los elementos mínimos para operar”, reveló Rodrigo Lecourtois. “Lo anterior amerita sanción administrativa, y estando dentro del plazo de 30 días hábiles para informarlo a su Contraloría Interna, ésta tiene la obligación de iniciar un procedimiento de responsabilidad administrativa y en su caso, presentar la denuncia o denuncias que correspondan”, agregó. Asimismo, en el ámbito de la obra pública se detectaron obras pagadas y no ejecutadas, y en lo relativo a apoyos sociales, falta de padrón de beneficiarios y presunción de falsificación de éste, lo que se amplifica a alrededor del 40% de los Ayuntamientos. Esto representa una falta grave por el desvío de recursos que implica y su impacto negativo en la población más necesitada. Por otra parte en Axtla de Terrazas, con una elección muy reñida y posteriores impugnaciones, el expresidente municipal hizo caso omiso al proceso de Entrega – Recepción y llegó en ceros al Acto Protocolario; es presuntamente responsable de la sustracción de documentos físicos y digitales, ante lo cual la Contraloría Interna debe iniciar el procedimiento administrativo pertinente, enviar el recurso al Tribunal Estatal de Justicia Administrativa y determinar sanciones tales como inhabilitación, multa y/o resarcimiento económico. Finalmente, el titular del IFSE detalló otras irregularidades reportadas como la falta de formatos, entregas a destiempo, saqueo de mobiliario y equipo, mismas que deberán ser atendidas por el órgano interno de control, según lo establecen las leyes de la materia.

    "title": "Holocaust survivors recall sheltering in Shanghai - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "Ellen Chaim, who later changed her name to Ellen Kracko, received this teddy bear when she was 2 years old.[Photo provided by Minlu Zhang/China Daily] Jerry Lindenstraus is a 95-year-old Holocaust survivor who lives in an apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side in New York. People around him sometimes find it odd that the elderly Jewish man can speak a few Japanese words.\nWhenever the topic arises, Lindenstraus tells the story of how his family fled Germany and traveled to Shanghai in 1939 to escape the Holocaust.\nAfter Japan fully occupied Shanghai, all schools in the city were obligated to teach Japanese, and the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association School where Lindenstraus was living was no exception.\nIn 1939, one month before the outbreak of World War II, the 10-year-old Lindenstraus arrived in Shanghai from Gumbinnen, a small German town in what was then East Prussia.\nStepping off the boat, the young boy was sweating profusely under the layers of his heavy German suits and shirts. More than 80 years later, he still remembers Shanghai's brutally hot and humid summer.\nArriving with Lindenstraus were about 18,000 Jewish refugees who fled Nazi-occupied areas of Europe, settling in Shanghai from 1933 to 1941 to escape the Holocaust, as the Chinese city was among the few places that Jewish refugees were guaranteed acceptance in the early days of the war, according to the Shanghai Jewish Museum.\nA passport belonging to Mr Chaim when his family left Nazi Germany and sought refuge in Shanghai in 1939.[Photo provided by Minlu Zhang/China Daily] Lindenstraus' family did not realize it was time for them to leave until Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, occurred in 1938 when Nazis burned synagogues, vandalized Jewish homes, schools and businesses, and murdered close to 100 Jews and sent thousands of Jewish men to concentration camps.\n\"The next day I went to school but it was no longer there,\" Lindenstraus said.\nHowever, the family had limited options. In July 1938, representatives from 32 countries attended the Evian Conference in France, and none agreed to accept a significant number of Jewish refugees, including the United States, the United Kingdom and France.\nOnly two destinations were available to the Jewish family — Shanghai or the island of Madagascar on the coast of Africa. They chose the former, an open city where no visa was required for entry.\nThe family of Ellen Chaim, who later in life changed her name to Ellen Kracko, had never considered leaving Berlin before Kristallnacht, a place where her family had been living for generations.\n\"We are Germans, my grandfather fought for the Germans during World War I,\" Kracko said. \"They considered themselves good German citizens. But then Kristallnacht happened and they realized that they could not stay there anymore.\"\nThe Shanghai residence certificate of Jerry Lindenstraus.[Photo provided by Minlu Zhang/China Daily] In 1939, Kracko's parents joined the more than 10,000 Jewish people who sought refuge in Shanghai before and after World War II.\nLindenstraus lived in Shanghai from the age of 10 to 17. He attended a Jewish school with about 600 students and 17 teachers. He learned English, chased girls, and even met his best friend, Gary Kirchner, who was from Berlin.\nThe boys joined the British Boy Scouts in Shanghai, which became an illegal group after Japan declared war on the UK and the US at the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941.\nHowever, life in Shanghai was not easy. Sanitation was poor and health conditions such as diarrhea were rampant in the Jewish refugee community.\nIn the cold, humid winter, Lindenstraus' father died of pneumonia four months after the family arrived in Shanghai because of a lack of antibiotics. Following the death of his father, Lindenstraus and his stepmother moved to Hongkew, now Hongkou district of Shanghai.\nKirchner's living conditions were even worse than Lindenstraus'. While Lindenstraus' stepmother was able to manage a small place to live, Kirchner and his parents lived in a big, barracks-like room that lacked privacy.\nAfter the outbreak of the Pacific War, policies toward Jewish communities in Shanghai grew increasingly worse, leading up to the Meisinger Plan, an agenda to kill all Jewish refugees in Shanghai.\nIn 1941, the Nazis tried to convince the Japanese, who were their allies, to exterminate all Jewish refugees in Shanghai. Two years later, a compromise was reached with the establishment of a \"Designated Area for Stateless Refugees\".\nA ghetto in the neighborhood of Hongkew was built, where all Jewish refugees had to relocate and were strictly isolated by Japanese soldiers. Jews could only leave the area with special permission.\nEllen Kracko.[Photo provided by Minlu Zhang/China Daily] Recreating life\nIn the war-torn Hongkew district, Jewish refugees started establishing small businesses and set themselves up as doctors and teachers. People wanted to recreate what they were doing back home, Kracko said.\nGradually, a Jewish area inside Hongkew came to be known as \"Little Vienna\" for its European-style cafes, delicatessens, nightclubs, shops and bakeries. Kracko's mother worked in a German bakery there.\nMaterial conditions were austere in the Jewish ghetto. On Kracko's first birthday, her grandfather baked a cake. She had no idea where he got the flour. The eggs and strawberry jam were from neighbors. The cake was taken to the bakery, where Kracko's mom worked, to be baked.\nThose memories were so deeply rooted in the family that many years after the war, when life had improved, Kracko's aunt would still stop people from throwing out used tea bags and would steep them repeatedly to make tea until the bags were no longer useful.\nKracko, now 77, has short, light, blonde hair. She was wearing a pink shirt and silver earrings during an interview with China Daily in her house by the sea in Westchester County, New York.\nShe is quite familiar with modern technology and uses an iPhone well. During the day, Kracko's phone was full of family messages. The great-grandmother was preparing for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, which was only a week away.\nWhen asked about her place of birth, Kracko's husband would often quip, \"You'd never guess where she was born.\"\nEllen would respond, \"I was born in 1947 in Shanghai after World War II.\"\nPeople would then look wide-eyed and ask, \"How?\"\nIt has been estimated that around World War II, more than 400 Jewish babies were born in Shanghai and were called \"Shanghai Babies\". Kracko is one of them.\nChinese, Japanese, Indians and other refugees from Germany and Austria lived in Hongkew. Shanghai at that time witnessed 1,000 monthly refugee arrivals, and Hongkew residents faced dire conditions since the start of the full-scale war in China in 1937, according to the Shanghai Jewish Museum.\nIn a less than 2.6-square-kilometer area, the ghetto was home to some 10,000 native Chinese residents living side by side with thousands of Jewish refugees, the museum said.\nThe Chaim family lived next to a Chinese family and Kracko's mother would send cookies to the Chinese lady who lived downstairs. The Chinese lady, even though she could not communicate with them, would give her noodles in return.\nJerry Lindenstraus.[Photo provided by Minlu Zhang/China Daily] Lindenstraus also had a Chinese family as neighbors in Hongkew. The Chinese family lived downstairs with their children and chickens, while Lindenstraus' family lived upstairs.\nThey were friendly with each other, but they did not understand each other's languages. Therefore, they communicated using pidgin English, a combination of English, German and Chinese words, Lindenstraus said.\n\"Believe it or not, the Chinese (who lived in Hongkew) were (treated) worse than we were,\" he said. \"The Japanese treated them terribly. The Chinese had to bow (when they saw the Japanese). We didn't have to bow. But I've seen it. If the Chinese didn't bow deep enough, boom, they were killed. It's terrible.\"\nOne school day, Lindenstraus' class went to a public swimming pool outside the ghetto. It was a hot, muggy day, and he and Kirchner spent hours in the pool. When it was time to leave, the two boys did not hear the signal and were left behind, Lindenstraus said.\nThey were picked up by a Japanese army truck.\n\"We were very scared,\" he said. When they finally arrived home, they found Lindenstraus' stepmother was so worried that she blamed everything on Kirchner and his mother, and the two mothers had a big fight.\nSheltered in Shanghai, Lindenstraus, along with many other Jewish refugees, did not know what had happened in Europe and the Holocaust — in which 6 million Jews across Europe were murdered — until Japan surrendered in 1945.\nThe day the war ended — at first no one knew Japan had surrendered — Kracko's mother remembered waking up early that morning and it was very quiet outside. She had never heard the street so quiet.\nThen, she heard people crying in the distance. Then came the laughter. Kracko's mother opened the door to find that all the Japanese stationed at the entrance of the ghetto had evacuated in the middle of the night — the war was over, she realized.\nThe Chaim family retained almost all evidence of their life in Shanghai, including a dog license issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Jewish couple had a Pekingese when they were living in Shanghai.\nIn 1949, when the Chaim family was preparing to leave Shanghai and packing their luggage, their dog, not knowing what was happening, chased after their car as they drove away. The small dog, of course, could not catch up to the car and the Chaim family never saw it again.\nAfter the war, Lindenstraus traveled to South America and the United States. Soon after settling in New York, he founded his own company.

    "title": "El papa Francisco dice que hay que tener el valor de \"negociar\" el fin de la guerra en Ucrania",
    "text": "El papa Francisco , en una entrevista con la Radio Televisión de la Suiza Italiana , declaró este sábado que en la guerra de Ucrania se debería tener \"el coraje de la bandera blanca\" y \"negociar\", matizando que este último término, es una \" palabra valiente \" para lograr el final del conflicto.\n\"Creo que es más fuerte quien ve la situación, quien piensa en el pueblo, quien tiene el valor de la bandera blanca, de negociar . Hoy se puede negociar con la ayuda de las potencias internacionales . La palabra negociar es una palabra valiente\", admitió el pontífice recogiendo la expresión \"bandera blanca\" usada previamente por el entrevistador.\n\"Cuando ves que estás derrotado, que las cosas no van, debes tener el valor de negociar \", añadió el pontífice. En el mismo sentido, y refiriéndose a la guerra de Gaza, el papa dijo: \"Negociar nunca es rendirse\".\nUnos sacerdotes rezan para que el papa \"pueda ir al cielo cuanto antes\" EFE \"No se avergüencen de negociar, antes de que la situación empeore\", dijo Francisco, que hizo numerosos llamamientos a favor de la paz en la \"martirizada Ucrania\" y que mandó a su enviado para el conflicto , el cardenal italiano Matteo Zuppi , a reunirse con las autoridades en Kiev, Moscú y Washington.\nhttps://twitter.com/vaticannews_it/status/1766499834834366736 La Embajada ucraniana: \"¿Alguien habló de las negociaciones de paz con Hitler?\" La Embajada de Ucrania ante la Santa Sede respondió este domingo al papa que durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial nadie habló \"de negociaciones de paz con Hitler \".\n\"¡Es muy importante ser coherentes! Cuando hablamos de la Tercera Guerra Mundial que tenemos ahora, debemos aprender las lecciones de la Segunda Guerra Mundial\", escribió la legación diplomática en sus redes sociales.\nPunto de Fisión - Rezo para que se muera el Papa David Torres https://twitter.com/UKRinVAT/status/1766557043320582252 \" ¿Alguien habló entonces seriamente de las negociaciones de paz con Hitler y de la bandera blanca para satisfacerlo? Así que la lección es sólo una: ¡si queremos terminar la guerra, tenemos que hacer todo lo posible para matar al Dragón !\", concluye.\nLa Santa Sede matiza que el papa Francisco no habla de \"rendición\" Tras publicarse los fragmentos de la entrevista –que será emitida íntegra el próximo 20 de marzo– la Santa Sede matizó que el papa no habla de rendición sino de negociación, según el portavoz vaticano, Matteo Bruni , citado por los medios italianos.\nhttps://twitter.com/vaticannews_it/status/1766549574473130445 \"El papa utiliza el término bandera blanca , y responde tomando la imagen propuesta por el entrevistador, para indicar con ella el cese de las hostilidades , la tregua alcanzada con el valor de la negociación. En otro momento de la entrevista, hablando de otra situación de conflicto, pero refiriéndose a cualquier situación bélica, el papa afirma claramente que la negociación nunca es rendición \".\nSegún Bruni, el deseo del papa sigue siendo el que ha repetido siempre en los últimos años (...): \"Mientras renuevo mi más profundo afecto por el atormentado pueblo ucraniano y rezo por todos, en particular por las innumerables víctimas inocentes, imploro que encontremos esa pizca de humanidad que nos permita crear las condiciones para una solución diplomática en la búsqueda de una paz justa y duradera\".\n¿Te ha resultado interesante esta noticia?\nMás noticias de Internacional",

She made it up. Kamala Harris is not \"working tirelessly\" to do anything at this time besides become the next president. Her own staff are saying she is opposed to an arms embargo on Israel and won't consider cutting or conditioning military aid, which is the only way the Israeli government can be effectively forced to stop sabotaging a peace deal so that the US-backed genocide can finally end. Saying you'll continue pouring military explosives into a regime that is using those military explosives to conduct regular massacres of civilians is the exact opposite of working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire. \"This is false, it's propaganda, and it's making people misunderstand the issue,\" Current Affairs' Nathan Robinson said of AOC's statement. \"The Biden administration could have imposed a ceasefire anytime it wanted to. The only reason there isn't one is that Biden has made sure Israel has no incentive to agree to one.\" As we deal with this crap, the DNC has approved a 2024 [party platform](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf) whose section on the middle east is so surprisingly hawkish that it largely reads like it could have been written by some of Washington's most war-horny Republicans. It repeatedly calls its support for Israel and the continuation of arms shipments thereto \"ironclad\". It criticizes Trump as having been too soft on Iran, for god's sake. After boasting about the Biden administration's bombing campaign against the \"Iranian-linked Houthi forces\" in Yemen, its \"precision airstrikes on key Iranian-linked targets,\" and its success in neutralizing Iran's retaliatory strikes on Israel after Israel assassinated multiple Iranian military officials in Syria, the platform says that this \"stands in sharp contrast to Trump's fecklessness and weakness in the face of Iranian aggression during his presidency.\" New Democratic Party Platform Pledges 'Ironclad' Commitment to Israel— Antiwar.com (@Antiwarcom) Platform also boasts of Biden's new military interventions in the Middle East, including the bombing campaign in [#Yemen] by Dave DeCamp [@DecampDave] [#Israel] [#Gaza] [#Palestinians] [#DNC2024] [https://t.co/mOmlFVEJhh] [pic.twitter.com/YPqlalFmAk] [August 20, 2024]",
