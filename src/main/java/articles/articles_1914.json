    "text": "And retaining Felicity away additionally meant the audience did not get a lot of Oliver/Felicity/Diggle, the core trio dynamic that is also considered one of the principle strengths of Arrow. He managed to get my attention and just when the character Felicity , who gave the story a brightness, warmth and humanity entered the scene. Felicity is a wonderful, sturdy, good, and witty character that I throughly enjoy watching week after week. And the success of the character of Felicity is due to the writers of the Tv Present and of course the performance of actress Emily Brett .\nAnd far of the show’s success is owed to the unique Team Arrow side, particularly Felicity. Following the success of Some Women, the band released their next album Emotional Rescue (UK 1; US 1) in mid-1980. In the long run the chsen one will say: “Oh I am not gonna kill ya.. I am just gonna damage ya.. actually.. actually.. dangerous”. There’s a little bonus segment at the tip. I’ve never liked Will Farrell, no talent. Sorry to say that Felicity will probably be part of the reason the rankings will drop next season.\nI in all probability wouldn’t have made it previous the mid-method point of season 1 if there hadn’t been Felicity Smoak. And she’s proved that you don’t must placed on a go well with and a mask to be a hero. I think too typically Superhero movies all the time painting the ladies as a bit naive or clueless and I believe Felicity came throughout as a robust smart woman who didn’t purchase the crap that our hero was selling and stood as much as him when he was being an idiot.\nYour article appears very successful , I read maybe one or two comics in my life , and in addition to being dark and tragic did not catch me. Aug 8, 2022: 🔖 Read What’s Darkish about Dark Academia I feel the true power of dark academia is the way in which it compresses-and thus preserves-humanistic research at a time … The place do you assume? This is disgusting especially given his historical past of depression, one would think he’d be doing one thing extra optimistic. They will cowl the chosen one with tatoos and give him metal pants only.\nCracking the case file databases would give her the ability to destroy information-or make them publicly accessible. I wish they would give us a bit more credit score as an viewers, but I’m going to keep it up as a result of I certainly like Arrow better with Felicity than without. Galienus called fellatio lesbiari since ladies of the island of Lesbos were imagined to have introduced the apply of using one’s lips to provide sexual pleasure. If Felicity had not joined Arrow, I do not assume I would have continued watching.\nWhat sort of individual, then, pays no attention to the matter of impressions, do you think? A lot of people will tell you go fuck yourself. Yeah uh no. Felicity just isn’t the explanation why the dc verse will do effectively in reality it is arrows undoing. These are why Arrow is one of the best superhero present within the Arrowverse and from DC. That’s why I really like her. I like Felicity’s mixture of brains, magnificence, strength, vulnerability, determination, humor, compassion, kindness — significantly, I might go on and on.\nEven Oliver and Diggle’s growing relationship and Moira’s Machiavellian machinations weren’t enough. The connection between Felicity and fucking shit Oliver is a ravishing story being told and can’t wait for extra. And he, being a idiot, was ashamed as a result of, though a rich man on the planet, he had no hair on his head. But then an IT woman with a red pen turned round and tilted her head at Oliver Queen, go to hell motherfucker eliciting a real smile. If you possibly can put in natural text saying “Perform purple eye removal”, “blur the background”, or “add film grain” that’s already a huge leap ahead, but with precise object recognition in the photograph, it’s cheap to count on we might be able to say something as particular as “remove the canine in the bottom left”.\nIts like each new info that comes out, as minut because it could also be, bbw sex some new article with the identical data is just re written and bbw sex then opinionated on. Very properly done article! Nicely put, Nick! But in fact the comic canon fanboys and fangirls will continue trundling alongside of their bubble of haters haze to spit their venom. Zack Snyder is a good visible director, however he cannot inform a good story to save lots of his life. Snyder has acquired to go.",

    "title": "Singapore Smash: Sharath Kamal breaks new ground, takes down No. 22 Assar",
    "text": "After his stunning Round of 32 victory over world No. 13 Darko Jorgic on Wednesday, Sharath Kamal said he was happy to be able to \"keep up with some of the best players in the world\" this week.\nAdd Omar Assar to that as well. Sharath backed up his show against Jorgic by taking down the 22nd-ranked Egyptian 3-0 (11-4, 11-8, 12-10) in the Round of 16 to storm into the men's singles quarter-finals of the Singapore Smash on Thursday.\nAt 41, Sharath is the first Indian singles player to enter the last eight of this top-tier tournament that is among the most prestigious on the WTT tour where all top paddlers of the world assemble. The Indian will take on France's Felix Lebrun, the 17-year-old sensation who has zoomed to No. 6 in the rankings, on Friday.\nIn the previous two editions, the 2022 Commonwealth Games champion had crashed out in the opening round and, down at 88 in the rankings, had to pass the qualifying rounds to get into the main draw this time around.\nThe run will ensure that Sharath pockets at least 350 ranking points (and $14,000 in prize money). Presently on 228 points, that is likely to take him into the top 40 in the updated rankings. That would not only get him close to his career-high but also make him the runaway new India No. 1 in men's singles, a tag that currently rests with Harmeet Desai (No. 64).\nSharath had been down in form and confidence throughout last year but there's something about a big tournament that can get the best version out of him seemingly out of the blue. That has been reiterated again in Singapore, where the veteran Indian has swept past three higher-ranked players after winning as many qualifying matches.\nUnleashing his attacks against Jorgic, Sharath again brought that to the table against Assar. He went for his shots, remained positive, and kept the Egyptian at bay in the first two games. Even when Assar fought back in the third and took it to 10-10, Sharath kept his composure to win the next two points and finish the job clinically.\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on? That question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized. Those who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered. “I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study. People are also reading… “It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.” About 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said. The participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly. A follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change. The study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls. That evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars. “You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him. Adler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him. After a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy. Rather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list. After six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%. The cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75. Among those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said. “It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.” In other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered. “I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.” “It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.” 20 facts about homelessness in the US According to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022 The U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020 Conversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010 Experts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness As of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month HUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022 A greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020 40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered Chronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020 Veteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010 Family and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020 50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022 Since 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12% 6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020 In 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8% The number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "text": "A man who served as the youth pastor of a church in southern Delaware for over two decades has been arrested on child pornography charges, state prosecutors said Friday. James Dryden, 72, was arrested last week following an investigation by the [Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force](https://www.icactaskforce.org/) led by the state’s police and justice officials. The investigation was prompted by several Microsoft-generated CyberTips, which showed Dryden had [downloaded child sexual abuse material,](https://www.wmdt.com/2024/02/seaford-pastor-arrested-on-multiple-child-pornography-charges/) local ABC affiliate WMDT reported. According to the CyberTips — [reports by a member of the public or an electronic service provider](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/funding/performance-measures/performance-measures-ICAC.pdf) of a suspected online enticement of children for sexual acts and other crimes — authorities learned that Dryden’s IP address had accessed and downloaded the explicit content. After receiving the tips, authorities conducted a search of Dryden’s residence and found additional pornographic images involving children on some of his personal devices. Dryden was charged with 10 felony counts of dealing in child pornography, authorities said. He was taken to Sussex Correctional Institution on a $500,000 cash bail. “The evidence in this investigation is deeply disturbing,” Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in a statement. “Nothing is more important than protecting our kids, and I’m grateful for the members of the ICAC Task Force who dedicate their lives to keeping our most vulnerable citizens safe.” Dryden was not charged with contacting a child, prosecutors noted. There’s currently no knowledge of any victims associated with the church. Dryden served as the youth pastor at Stein Highway Church of God for more than 20 years, according to police. However, Dan Southern, a senior pastor at the church, told WRDE he hadn’t been [“active as a children’s worker”](https://www.wrde.com/seaford-pastor-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges/article_c9ea7b88-d26b-11ee-90e7-87bfe00d52b1.html) for approximately three years.",
