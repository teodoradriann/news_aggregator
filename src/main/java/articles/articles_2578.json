    "title": "\"Warning sign\": Panic in Ma'ale Adumim after Palestinian workers entered the industrial zone without inspection | Israel today - The Limited Times",
    "text": "Individual security guards, most of them untrained as fighters, in front of hundreds of Palestinian workers.\nThe location: the industrial area at the entrance to Mishor Adumim, which suffered an attack just a few months ago.\nThis is what one of the main industrial areas in Judea and Samaria looks like every day.\nYesterday, in the early hours of the morning, a serious security incident occurred at this point of friction.\nHundreds of Palestinians flocked into the compound without any checks.\nThe soldiers of the standby squad, who arrived on the field on their own accord and without any order, stood aside and rubbed their eyes in astonishment.\nThe guard post in Mishor Adumim, after the attack at the end of December,\nThe Ma'ale Adumim municipality issued a clarification and claimed that it was a one-off glitch: \"This is a misleading video, in which Palestinians were seen breaking through a barrier and entering the industrial zone without inspection. As a result, shock and panic reigned throughout the city.\"\nAccording to them, the load on the checkpoint \"came as a result of an electrical fault at the check-in terminal. Everyone who enters Meshar Adumim and Ma'al Adumim goes through a comprehensive check, and everything is in order.\"\nOn the municipal Facebook page, they asked for reassurance and clarified that \"only 50 workers, all with an entry permit, walked to their workplace and were stopped by the security department 100 meters from the entrance barrier.\"\nAttack in Maale Adumim (archive), photo: Oren Ben Hakon\nHowever, eyewitnesses are convinced that the municipality played down the omission, in an attempt to curb criticism of it.\n\"Everyone is trying to protect themselves because they don't want panic.\nIn practice, hundreds of undocumented Palestinians entered Mishar Adumim, and the members of the standby squad were almost trampled,\" said one of those present at the event.\nAn attack every few months\nThe allegations raise glaring question marks regarding the municipality's conduct regarding the entry of workers into the city, against the background of the security history in the area in recent months.\nIn August, a cleaning worker at the municipal community center, Mahand Almazareh, opened fire on passers-by near a mall in the city. Six Israelis were injured before he was neutralized. During the interrogation, he said that he was not feeling well, so the resident of the city drove him home. There he armed himself, and then returned without being checked. into Maale Adumim.\nThe Palestinian workers enter the inspection, yesterday, photo: use according to Section 27 A of the Copyright Law\nA month ago, another attack was carried out, in the exact place where the hundreds of workers flocked yesterday.\nA terrorist stabbed a security guard at the guard post.\nHe was shot, injured and later took control of a weapon and tried to use it to shoot the security guards.\nAfter the serious attack last August, the municipality announced that every worker who comes to work in the city - will undergo a check using a magnetometer.\nIt was also decided that workers will be prohibited from entering with a bag, and that all bags in their possession will be checked before entering.\nBut statements are separate and reality is separate.\nAlthough a magnetometer was placed at the entrance to the city, but according to the residents, the terminal has been hacked, and it does not include a mirror device and is not adapted to deal with hundreds of Palestinians, so the checking is not optimal.\n\"They go through the magnetometer, but move the bags and bags aside. It's a joke,\" say eyewitnesses.\nUrgent letter to the Minister of Defense\nThe Minister of Settlements and National Missions, Orit Struck, wrote an urgent letter to the Minister of Defense Yoav Galant, so that he would address the failure that occurred at the entrance to Mishor Adumim at the upcoming cabinet meeting.\n\"According to evidence from the field, the security check system (terminal) is far from being normal,\" she wrote and demanded to examine the multiple claims heard from the field.\nstroke\nWill an inspection team be established for the event?, Photo: Oren Ben Hakon\nStrock requests answers from Galant regarding the status of the inspection systems in all the industrial areas where Palestinian workers work;\nHow does the system intend to prevent a similar invasion in the future, and if an investigation team will be established for the incident.\n\"This serious incident, which has ended for the time being with no casualties, must be a warning sign for the future,\" she said.\nThe Ma'ale Adumim municipality denied the evidence: \"The security situation has been upgraded in recent times, especially with the opening of the inspection terminal about two months ago. The inspection is done for each employee personally, the bags are opened and the contents are checked.\"\nThe municipality claimed that \"the security system at the site provides the best and maximum response, especially in the current period\", and emphasized that the security system and security patrols at the site will even be increased.\nwere we wrong\nWe will fix it!\nIf you found an error in the article, we would appreciate it if you shared it with us",

    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis has said in an interview that Ukraine should have what he called the courage of the \"white flag\" and negotiate an end to the war with Russia that followed Moscow's full-scale invasion two years ago and that has killed tens of thousands.\nFrancis made his comments in an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI, well before Friday's latest offer by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war.\nErdogan made the fresh offer after a meeting in Istanbul with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy has said while he wants peace he will not give up any territory.\nThe Ukrainian leader's own peace plan calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine and the restoration of its state borders. The Kremlin has ruled out engaging in peace talks on terms set by Kyiv.\nIn the interview Francis was asked for his position on a debate between those who say Ukraine should give up as it has not been able to repel Russian forces, and those who say doing so would legitimise actions by the strongest party. The interviewer used the term \"white flag\" in the question.\n\"It is one interpretation, that is true,\" Francis said, according to an advance transcript of the interview and a partial video made available to Reuters on Saturday. It is due to be broadcast on March 20 as part of a new cultural programme.\n\"But I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,\" Francis said, adding that talks should take place with the help of international powers.\n\"The word negotiate is a courageous word. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate,\" Francis said.\nIt was believed to be the first time Francis has used terms such as \"white flag\" or \"defeated\" in discussing the Ukraine war, although he has spoken in the past about the need for negotiations.\nLast year the 87-year-old pope sent a peace envoy, Italian Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, to Kyiv, Moscow and Washington to sound out leaders in those countries.\n\"One may feel shame,\" Francis said about negotiating, \"but how many dead will it (the war) end up with? (One should) negotiate in time, find a country that can be a mediator,\" Francis said, mentioning Turkey among the countries that had offered.\n\"Do not be ashamed of negotiating, before things get worse,\" said Francis, who has made hundreds of appeals for what he calls \"martyred Ukraine\". Asked if he was willing to mediate, Francis said \"I am here\".\nIn another part of the interview, speaking of the war between Israel and Hamas, Francis said: \"Negotiating is never a surrender\".\nLast month Zelenskiy said that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the Russian invasion in February 2022 and that tens of thousands of civilians had been killed in the occupied areas of the country.\n(Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Frances Kerry)\nBy Philip Pullella\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Apoio questionado\nDiante da repercussão sobre o apoio financeiro do governo estadual à escola de samba Portela para o Carnaval de 2026, o deputado Rodrigo Lorenzoni (PL) protocolou pedido de informações ao Executivo. No documento enviado ao Piratini, o parlamentar questiona valores já aportados ou previstos, bem como a origem orçamentária desses recursos — se da cultura, do turismo ou do fundo de reconstrução. Em justificativa, o deputado alegou que, diante das perdas causadas pelas enchentes no RS e das dificuldades enfrentadas por hospitais, empresas e famílias, o patrocínio à escola de samba “não parece ser, neste momento, a melhor escolha”.\nDívidas em pauta\nEm conversa por telefone, o governador Eduardo Leite dialogou ontem (18) com o ministro da Agricultura, Carlos Fávaro, sobre a situação crítica do endividamento dos produtores rurais do RS. Leite tornou a defender a utilização de recursos do Fundo Social – abastecido com verbas da exploração do pré-sal, inclusive dos royalties da cessão onerosa – além da simplificação dos processos de comprovação de perdas de produtividade por parte dos produtores, como condição para acesso às prorrogações previstas em resolução do Conselho Monetário Nacional. Em resposta à articulação, o chefe ministerial sinalizou que o governo federal deve publicar, nos próximos dias, a criação de um grupo de trabalho voltado à construção de uma solução estruturante para as dívidas do campo.\nApuração de denúncias\nA deputada estadual Luciana Genro (PSOL) encaminhou ofício à presidência da AGERGS cobrando providências diante de denúncias envolvendo a CEEE Equatorial. Segundo relatos recebidos pela parlamentar, a concessionária estaria realizando ligações de energia de forma unilateral em comunidades de Porto Alegre, instalando medidores sem consentimento prévio e posteriormente emitindo cobranças retroativas, baseadas em estimativas e sem contrato formal. As queixas se concentram entre famílias em situação de vulnerabilidade social, que também relatam falta de informação sobre como contestar os valores. No documento, Luciana solicita à agência reguladora informações sobre as medidas adotadas para apurar os casos e eventuais descumprimentos contratuais por parte da empresa. A parlamentar também pede a criação de um passo a passo acessível para orientar os consumidores lesados e a ampla divulgação de materiais informativos.\nVolta às aulas\nO deputado Luciano Silveira (MDB) reuniu-se nesta semana com o vice-governador Gabriel Souza para debater o início do ano letivo em 2026 no RS. O parlamentar propôs que as aulas não retornem no dia 18 de fevereiro, que será na quarta-feira de cinzas, diante dos potenciais prejuízos econômicos para a região do Litoral Norte, além dos transtornos gerados para as famílias que estarão de férias neste período. Em resposta ao pleito, Gabriel se comprometeu a buscar o diálogo com a Secretaria de Educação, para transferir o início das aulas para 23 de fevereiro.\nSaúde mental\nOs vereadores de Porto Alegre aprovaram nesta quarta-feira a proposta legislativa da vereadora Psicóloga Tanise Sabino (MDB) que institui o Programa Permanente em Saúde Mental, destinado à comunidade das escolas públicas da rede municipal de ensino. A ação trabalhará para garantir o acesso à atenção psicossocial a integrantes do meio, além de distribuir materiais didático-informativos e promover encontros para sensibilizar a comunidade sobre a importância da temática. Tanise propôs também atenção especial à educação permanente de gestores e profissionais da educação na área da saúde mental, capacitando-os a identificar problemas relacionados à questão. Validado pelo Legislativo, o texto segue para sanção do prefeito Sebastião Melo.\nBruno Laux\n@obrunolaux",
