    "title": "Punjab Sees 15% Surge in Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) adoption",
    "text": "/ Punjab’s ongoing Kharif sowing season has reached its midpoint, witnessing a significant 15 percent increase in the adoption of the water-conserving Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) technique. This year, over two lakh acres have been sown using DSR, compared to 1.72 lakh acres during the entire Kharif season the previous year. Crediting the increase to the persistent efforts by the Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, Punjab Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Gurmeet Singh Khudian on Thursday hailed this as a great success and expressed optimism about achieving the target of five lakh acres under DSR this season, as set by the Agriculture Department. The Minister highlighted that the Punjab Government is providing financial assistance of Rs 1,500 per acre to encourage farmers to adopt the DSR technique. The Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department has allocated Rs 50 crore for this purpose during the 2024-25 fiscal year. “In the previous year, the Punjab Government provided Rs 20.33 crore in financial assistance to 17,116 farmers for adopting DSR,” said the Minister, urging more farmers to join hands with the State Government in conserving groundwater by opting for this efficient technique. Farmers who have chosen to use DSR must register on the government portal — agrimachinerypb.com — by July 15, 2024, to receive the financial assistance. Minister emphasized that the DSR technique not only conserves water but also reduces labour costs and results in higher yields.",

    "text": "MultiVersus could be coming to an end. A new rumor from known MultiVersus leaker AusilMV suggests that the game’s upcoming Season 5 could be the last one.\n“[MultiVersus] Season 5 may be the final season of MultiVersus, depending on how it performs,” they said while prefacing that this isn’t confirmed yet.. “A notable source shared this rumor with me, stating that Season 5 may be a “last-ditch effort” for the game.”\nInsider Gaming has reached out Warner Bros. Games and developer Player First Games for comment on the rumor. Should a response be received, it will be amended to this story.\nRELATED: Year In Review—MultiVersus Had it All And Threw it Away\nThe idea that MultiVersus could be heading towards a tipping point shouldn’t come as much of a surprise to players and outsiders alike. Since the game launched with high player numbers nearly three years ago, its popularity has dwindled. The game saw a peak player count on Steam of 153,433 players before it fell by 99% within its first few months.\nAfter it struggled to regain traction, Warner Bros. Games announced it was taking the game down in June 2023 after what it then started to call an “open beta” period. It was re-released in May 2024 with numerous updates and changes in the months since. However, it has yet to return to the numbers it had when it first launched and the hype from players was there.\nMultiVersus Season 5 is scheduled to start in early February. It’ll be interesting to see what the developers have planned to try and get players to not only pick up their game, but stick around after.\nWhat do you make of the rumors that Season 5 could be MultiVersus’ last? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.\nFor more Insider Gaming, check out the free games coming to PlayStation Plus members in February and and check out the leaked new expansion pack for The Sims 4.

    "text": "The European Commission announced it has imposed a fine of €797.72 million or $840.24 million on Meta Platforms for allegedly abusing its market position to benefit Facebook Marketplace, an online classified ads service.\nMeta Quest Pro VR headset According to the Commission, Meta breached EU antitrust rules by linking its classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace, with its social networking platform, Facebook. This practice, the Commission stated, imposed unfair conditions on other online classified ad services.\nThe size of the online classified ad platform market is expected to grow by $27.86 billion over a five-year period, achieving a CAGR of 11.53 percent from 2023 to 2028.\nMeta Platforms, the # social media platform, has generated digital ad revenue of $9.358 billion from Europe alone during the third-quarter of 2024.\nThe penalty follows a lengthy investigation that began in June 2021, with EU regulators formally examining Meta’s business practices.\nBy December 2022, the Commission raised specific concerns about Meta’s alleged anti-competitive tactics, arguing that bundling Facebook with Marketplace limited competition and potentially disadvantaged other digital classified ad platforms.\nAll Facebook users are automatically exposed to Facebook Marketplace, providing Marketplace with a distribution advantage that competitors cannot easily replicate. This arrangement, the Commission argues, limits competition by preventing other online classifieds services from competing fairly.\nMeta allegedly imposed conditions on advertisers using Facebook and Instagram that allow Meta to use ad data solely for the benefit of Facebook Marketplace, thereby disadvantaging competing classified ads services.\n“Meta tied its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace to its personal social network Facebook and imposed unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers,” Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy, said.\n“Meta did so to benefit its own service Facebook Marketplace, thereby giving it advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behavior,” Margrethe Vestager said.\nWhile Meta claims that users have the option not to engage with Marketplace, the Commission insists that Meta’s approach constitutes an illegal “tying” practice.\nIn response, Meta has expressed its intention to appeal the decision, though it plans to comply with the ruling in the interim. The company is working on a solution to address the issues highlighted by the Commission.\nUnder EU antitrust law, companies can be fined up to 10 percent of their global turnover for violations, reinforcing the European Union’s commitment to regulating fair competition among major tech corporations.\nBaburajan Kizhakedath",

    "text": "Title: John F. Kennedy’s Houston Speech: A Defining Moment for Religious Freedom Introduction: In a pivotal moment that shaped his presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy delivered a remarkable speech before the Houston Ministerial Association. This speech, captured in the “Great Speeches Volume 4” from Educational Video Group, Inc., stands as a testament to Kennedy’s unwavering commitment to religious freedom and the separation of church and state. Through his eloquent words and unwavering conviction, Kennedy addressed the concerns of religious leaders and reassured the nation of his dedication to upholding the principles enshrined in the First Amendment. The Houston Speech: A Context: As a Catholic running for president in a predominantly Protestant nation, John F. Kennedy faced skepticism and concerns regarding his religious beliefs and their potential influence on his political decisions. To address these concerns head-on, Kennedy chose Houston, Texas, as the setting for a crucial speech that would define his stance on religious freedom. Key Themes and Arguments: - Separation of Church and State: Kennedy emphasized the importance of maintaining a clear separation between religious institutions and government affairs. He affirmed that the government should not endorse or favor any particular religion, ensuring equal treatment and respect for all faiths. - Religious Freedom as a Fundamental Right: Kennedy passionately argued that religious freedom is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. He stressed that individuals should be free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or persecution. - The Role of Religion in Public Life: Kennedy acknowledged the significant role religion plays in American society, but he also emphasized that religious beliefs should not dictate public policy. He advocated for a government that respects and accommodates religious diversity while upholding secular principles. Impact and Legacy: John F. Kennedy’s Houston speech proved to be a turning point in his presidential campaign. It effectively dispelled doubts about his commitment to religious freedom and resonated with voters across the nation. His speech is widely regarded as a defining moment in American history, reaffirming the importance of religious freedom as a cornerstone of American democracy. Conclusion: John F. Kennedy’s Houston speech stands as a powerful reminder of the enduring significance of religious freedom in American society. Through his eloquent words and unwavering conviction, Kennedy reassured the nation of his commitment to upholding the principles of separation of church and state, ensuring equal rights and respect for all faiths. This speech continues to inspire and guide future generations in their pursuit of religious freedom and the preservation of a diverse and inclusive society.",

    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests. If you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported. The once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website. The date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported. Here’s what we know about the date. Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated. FYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches. A palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. Numerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated. Here are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac : Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today 30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",
