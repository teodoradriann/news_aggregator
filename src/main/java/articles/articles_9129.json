    "title": "Gemini Cleared by SEC as Dexboss Emerges as the Next Big Cryptocurrency to Watch",
    "text": "With the SEC’s decision to take no further action against Gemini, the exchange joins the ranks of an ever-more-expanding list of crypto firms that are, for now, sidestepping regulatory penalties. Cameron Winklevoss shared the SEC’s notice that “based on the information we have,” the case is closed.\nThis result provides immense relief to Gemini and, indeed, investors, attesting to how compliance can help result in positive outcomes amid the growing pressure of regulatory scrutiny. While the crypto market is still coming to terms with evolving regulations, the case of Gemini shows just how crucial compliance and transparency are in providing a glimpse of predictability in a space that’s constantly in flux.\nWith regulatory clarity emerging and market dynamics shifting, now is the perfect time to explore the next big cryptocurrency opportunities. As Dexboss continues to gain momentum with its innovative DeFi solutions, savvy investors are keeping a close eye on promising crypto projects.\nTop 5 Promising Crypto Coins for 2024 The phenomenon of cryptocurrencies presents expansion and a variety of ways for investors to invest in a project that is innovative and has a strong opportunity to grow. Whether in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, or blockchain infrastructure, these are the crypto assets that our technology is the core of and which have high use cases as well as growth potential that were shortlisted.\nDexBoss ($DEBO) Aureal One (DLUME) Adobe (ADBE) Polkadot (DOT) Chainlink (LINK) 1. DexBoss ($DEBO) – A New Era of Decentralized Trading DexBoss brings the concept of decentralized trading to life by offering problem-free transactions, providing large liquidity, and employing state-of-the-art trading tools. The $DEBO token, which was sold at a mere $0.01 during the presale, will provide early buyers with a chance to earn up to 405% instantly following exchange debut.\nClick here to know more about DexBoss\nKey Features:\nMarket orders are almost executed in real time to enable easy trades. A combination of controlled fees and deep liquidity pools that consequently lead to lower slippage. Tools for margin trading and liquidity farming that are meant for experienced traders. With a total amount of money raised of $50 million over 17 funding rounds, DexBoss is standing against the competition and wants to play a bigger role as a DeFi player. The project’s structured incentivizing model and incredibly high usage should tell you that $DEBO will most likely be one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies in 2024.\n2. Aureal One (DLUME) – Powering Gaming and the Metaverse The Blockchain focuses on gaming with high throughput and low transaction costs. The currency, DLUME , is both a proprietary trading asset and an intermediary for transactions in the ecosystem.\nA level of trustlessness that was never seen before is ensured by zero-knowledge rollups. A blockchain that is designed with gaming in mind and is easily integrated with BSC was the smooth gateway to success. The system that has a stacked-up facility to offer early investors the best perks ever is directly related to realistic, lifelike decisions. At this point, the DLUME token is worth $0.0011, and the presale is held through 21 rounds until hitting a listing price of $0.0055, which is the first game, Clash of Tiles, presented by Aureal One produces an investment opportunity not to be missed by the metaverse and gamers.\n3. Adobe (ADBE) – Revolutionizing Digital Art with Blockchain Although not a cryptocurrency, Adobe (ADBE) is a major Web3 and digital assets company. The company has blended blockchain verification tools with their creative software creating a new era of artists’ empowerment and a secure environment for their transactions.\n NFTs and digital art that are guaranteed by the blockchain In the Web3 phase, decentralized content production is in progress thanks to the adoption of this technology. It shows everywhere, it is a good time to buy. The price is $490. For those investors who need their portfolios to include all the new digital assets that blockchain has delivered to the world, they can find it by investing in stocks of Adobe.\n4. Polkadot (DOT) – Leading Blockchain Interoperability Designed to be one of the most developed blockchain platforms in the world, Polkadot provides a unique feature that allows various networks to be interconnected easily. The multiprocessing is achieved through its parachain technology that ensures simultaneous operating between numerous blockchains and effective working scaled information.\n DeFi applications benefit from the presence of interoperability between various chains. Parachain auctions are a catalyst for the cryptocurrency network growth One way Degens (DAO) supports the most profitable and sustainable way to borrow and earn is by lending at a variable rate and borrowing at a fixed rate. Together, these lending and borrowing actions allow for this type of system to keep functioning and expand. With the growth of the blockchain network, Polkadot will be a strategic player in the DeFi sector.\n5. Chainlink (LINK) – The Backbone of Smart Contracts Chainlink is the leading oracle network that allows smart contracts to work with off-chain data like real-life data. This is done through the point-by-point bridge between the blockchain and the off-chain sources. LINK is a significant contributor to the decentralization of the financial, gaming, and large-scale industry.\nTrustworthy data feeds for smart contract automation. The DeFi platforms want to form more collaborations with Chainlink. Trading at $7.35 and adoption is strong. Defi and Web3 are perhaps two of the fastest-growing spaces that expand, and Chainlink play a major role in applying it to the security of the data flow in the blockchain systems.\nConclusion The crypto sector is very dynamic, and names like DexBoss and Aureal One illustrate the vast possibilities of blockchain in the fields of trading and gaming. Yet, Adobe, Polkadot, and Chainlink are the three companies paving the way for necessary technological developments.\nThus, for prospective investors, the high-growth offerings of the videocoin service, namely DEBO and DLUME, are the most attractive, and the industry backends offered by Adobe, Polkadot, and Chainlink should be at the top of the list. The continuous talk about these projects will be a huge help for investors when they commercialize the future of decentralized finance and blockchain innovation.",

However, even after losing his belt and retiring, he remains a key fixture of the show. He even appeared on a Superbowl advert last year , giving the NWA more promotion than they’ve had in years.\nFNC's @greggutfeld ad airs during Super Bowl halftime pic.twitter.com/IbqpukwU7c\n— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) February 13, 2023 In a recent episode of the show, Tyrus was sat next to former US President Donald Trump . The WWE Hall of Famer is still campaigning for this year’s election, as he aims to beat Kamala Harris and sit in the White House again.\nWanting to show his appreciation for Trump, the former NWA Champion handed him his own custom championship. The gold belt was emblazoned with “Trump 2024” on the front, showing Fox’s support for his campaign.\n“Thank you for WrestleMania IV and V, by the way” Tyrus said, referencing the events that were held at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City. “Thank you very much. But if you’re going to sit in that chair. If you’re going to do the Tyrus experience, you have to do it right. Because you are the people’s champion, Mr Trump.”\nDonald Trump was impressed at how heavy the belt was, exclaiming that it was a “real one”.

    "text": "Creation of small reservoirs across Chennai vital for flood mitigation: WRD\nTo create new channels between Thiruneermalai and Padalam along the Adyar, approximately 900 hectares of land is required.\nPublished: 02nd January 2024 11:25 AM | Last Updated: 02nd January 2024 11:25 AM | A+A A-\nCHENNAI: In a bid to reduce the impact of floods in future, the WRD is planning to create tiny reservoirs across several places in the city and its outskirts to divert and conserve floodwater since constructing new channels to tackle floods in these areas does not seem feasible.\nA senior WRD official told TNIE, “Following heavy rain in 2015 and 2023, areas like Mudichur, Mannivakkam, west Tambaram and the nearby regions witnessed severe inundation. Recognising the need for a solution, WRD inspected Adyar belts and concluded that building tiny reservoirs and new channels is imperative to redirect excess water.\nTo create new channels between Thiruneermalai and Padalam along the Adyar, approximately 900 hectares of land is required. However, these areas are densely populated with residences, industries, and commercial establishments, making land acquisition practically impossible. The state government’s move in this direction could lead to legal challenges, and the financial burden alone would exceed `10,000 crore, considering the inability to secure additional loans.”\nAnother official said, “Currently, six reservoirs - Cholavaram, Chembarambakkam, Poondi, Red Hills, Kannankottai-Thervoykandigai, and Veeranam - with a combined capacity of 13 tmcft address Chennai’s drinking water needs against an annual demand of 22 tmcft. This is projected to rise to 32 tmcft by 2035 due to population growth. Building new reservoirs will help to meet future needs while also curtailing the impact of floods.”\nTo meet escalating water demands, the government plans to inaugurate a new reservoir at Orathur near Padappai on the city’s outskirts. The upgrade of Orathur and Arambakkam tanks will also contribute to the creation of this waterbody at Orathur capable of storing 500 million cubic feet.",

Con 15 años sabes de sobra que matar y torturar a otros está mal.\n[#18](c18#c-18) Si, pero ¿Te puedes fiar de ella ahora? Si se puediese tener la certeza al 100% de que fue una estupidez de adolescente que se le.paso por completo y que ya no sie te ninguna simpatía hacia las ideologías extremistas, deberían devolverle la ciudadanía.\nPero no hay forma de saberlo, y devolvérsela puede ser meter al enemigo en casa.\nYo tampoco correría el riesgo, prefiero que ella tenga que asumir las consecuencias de sus actos a que por confiar sea otro el que resulte lastimado.\n[#2](c2#c-2) ya lo podríamos hacer con los españoles y españolas que se van a Israel a hacer el servicio militar y si además han participado en Gaza acusarles de asesinato, genocidio y crímenes de guerra.\n[#2](c2#c-2) “Que le den por saco, por unirse a una banda terrorista.” — Dijo Cherenkov con la bandera palestina de avatar.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Con 15 años no eres responsable y consciente de tus actos, pero si ves mierda de perro en una acera si eres consiente y responsable para saber que eso no se come, o sea, esos \"menores\" son menores para unas cosas y para otras no\".\nEn España, a principio del siglo XX, mucha gente a los 15 años ya estaba casada y todo, era gente adulta... pero ahora es menor.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Sí, pero... ¿y si la mierda la han pintado de colores y luego le han puesto purpurina por encima?\n[#3](c3#c-3) Bueno, al parecer la tipa una vez mayor de edad se dedicaba a recaudar fondos para el Estado Islámico y\n\"Shamima se casó con un combatiente del Estado Islámico y tuvo tres hijos, todos los cuales murieron.\"\nLa BBC rastreó a Shamima después de recibir un aviso sobre una cuenta de redes sociales que estaba usando. El medio británicotambién dijo que encontró pruebas de que estaba recaudando fondos en línea para miembros del EI, lo cual es ilegal.\nun periodista la contactó después de que escapase de la prisión Camp Hol de Siria para mujeres que estaban con el grupo terrorista y sus hijos.\nDurante dichos intercambios, Shamima despidió a su ex amiga por “vivir de los beneficios” y se burló de ella como una fracasada y una no creyente.\nUn ex miembro de la organización terrorista le dijo a la BBC que la joven era fanática incluso para los estándares del Estado Islámico.\nhttps://www.larazon.es/internacional/shamima-begum-novia-yihad-britanica-que-indigno-pais-creyente-segun-amigo-que-inspiro-unirse-estado-islamico_20230322641b5d82079ac90001803bb2.html\n[#6](c6#c-6) Sí, ahora con ~25 tacos ya tiene que ser consciente de su mierda y que ella se la ha buscado (No me parece mal que le retiren la ciudadanía). Pero las raices de eso son de hace 10 años. Por eso no lo veo tan blanco o negro. Quizás ahora simplemente es tarde para una mejor solución.\nY que mira, que si la tía es tan fanática, con su pan se lo coma.\n[#6](c6#c-6) A ver, lo que pone en esa noticia es verdad aunque esté fatal explicado.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65031943\nEsta es la fuente original y en ella no consigo entender cuándo fue lo de \"pedía dinero a través de internet y ese dinero acababa en manos de EI\".\nLo de \"se casó y tuvo hijos\" es lo que se dijo en el 2019, por lo que se casó y tuvo tres hijos teniendo entre 15 y 19 años. Que no ha pasado de 15 años a mayor de edad sin nada de por medio.\nPero vamos, que todo apunta a que apenas se arrepiente y que está demasiado vinculada al radicalismo como para dejarla volver sin vigilancia continua.\n[#6](c6#c-6) \"vivir de los beneficios\" es una traduccion horrible de \"live off benefits\" (o como sea el originbal). Basicamente, es vivir de las ayudas sociales que en Inglaterra se llaman benefits. T\n[#26](c26#c-26) No, vivir de la beneficiencia es vivir de instituciones y demas. Yo, por tener hijos, tengo derecho al child benefit. Eso no significa que mis hijos estan en la benficiciencia, sino que el gobierno me da unas cuantas libras al mes como ayuda para mantener a mis hijos.\n[#33](c33#c-33) Como va a ser la traduccion correcta si cambia el significado? Las ayudas economicas a los parados en España, en Inglaterra se llaman benefits. Cualquier ayuda economica del gobierno, se llama benefits como palabra generica.\nAqui estan los benefits a los que me refiero:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/low-income\nNo creo que eso sea beneficencia.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Beneficencia = donaciones, charities, comedores sociales, etc. Benefits = prestaciones, subsidios y ayudas del estado (ver https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits ).\nQuien vive de benefits aquí en UK es alguien que vive de las diferentes ayudas/prestaciones del estado (por hijo, por desempleo, por discapacidad, etc), no de donaciones/charities, que sería vivir de beneficencia.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Cierto, luego piensas que esta gente ponian videos de decapitaciones y quemar vivos a prisioneros y ....\nhay cosas que son dificiles de perdonar.\nBastante lógico. Los fanáticos, mejor cuanto más lejos, sin importar la edad a la que se fanatizó.\nSi les podemos denunciar por captar a personas y esto es delito deberiamos aceptar que hay personas en situacion de vulnerabilidad o incluso de falta de capacidad d raciocinio al completo (Menor de edad) como para que puedas asumir que no son totalmente libres de tomar esas decisiones (Puedes ser mayor de edad y tomar decisiones de manera coaccionada)\nQue sera lo siguiente? Te han estafado pero.. como eres mayor de edad, deberias haberte dado cuenta. Ah si, te ha violado... pero, deberias haber sido lista para no ir con esa persona que tenia malas pintas....\n[#10](c10#c-10) Saludos. Creo que la diferencia con esos ejemplos que das es que la víctima no se volvió victimario. Si el estafado se metió en un esquema ponzi y terminó estafando a otras personas posiblemente algo le caería también; igualmente si el violado termina considerando que ese comportamiento es correcto y él mismo viola a otros, impune dudo que salga. Podrán considerarse atenuantes, pero la responsabilidad existe, en el caso de ella igualmente habrá atenuantes, y tal vez por eso no sufriría una pena mayor como pasar el resto de su vida en una cárcel (al menos por ahora, otra cosa es que siga acumulando delitos), sino sólo la pérdida de la nacionalidad que es una medida que busca proteger a la sociedad.\nAleluya!!! Por fin llega el sentido común y la cordura.\nTe vas a esclavizar yazidíes, a apedrear mujeres, a colaborar con terroristas. Pues ya quedate allí.\nSe unio a un protoestado cuyo objetivo era destruir -entre otros- al Reino Unido, pues que se joda. Que la manden a Siria donde seguro cumplira pena en condiciones. Bonus extra por quitarse el velo para no parecer lo que seguro que sigue siendo. Me recuerda al psicopata aquel Rodrigo Lanza que en el juicio por asesinato iba bien vestido, peinado y aseado para disimular que es un antifa\nPues porque nunca fue británica para empezar. Solo es británico el que tiene sangre británica, del mismo modo que solo es Español el que tiene sangre española. Lo de la nacionalidad oficial es un papel con valor legal con fines organizativos, pero la verdadera nacionalidad, la que realmente cuenta, se lleva en los genes, se lleva en la sangre. Es de puro sentido común.",
