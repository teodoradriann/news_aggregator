    "title": "5 Steps to protect your hair from summer heat",
    "text": "Shutterstock ALBAWABA As the summer months roll in, the combination of heat, humidity, and exposure to the sun can wreak havoc on your hair. To keep your locks healthy and looking their best, it&#039;s essential to take proactive steps to protect them from the harsh summer conditions. Here are five key steps to help you shield your hair from the damaging effects of the summer heat. 1. Hydrate Your Hair Regularly One of the most crucial steps in summer hair care is keeping your hair hydrated. The sun can strip your hair of its natural moisture, leaving it dry and brittle. To counteract this, use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner designed to replenish moisture. Consider incorporating a leave-in conditioner or a deep conditioning treatment into your routine once a week to give your hair an extra boost of hydration. Pro Tip: Use products containing natural oils like argan, coconut, or jojoba oil for additional moisture and nourishment. 2. Minimize Heat Styling Summer heat combined with heat styling tools can lead to excessive damage and breakage. To protect your hair, limit the use of blow dryers, curling irons, and straighteners. Embrace your natural hair texture or opt for heat-free styling methods, such as braids, buns, or air-drying your hair. Pro Tip: If you must use heat styling tools, apply a heat protectant spray to shield your hair from the high temperatures. 3. Shield Your Hair from the Sun Prolonged sun exposure can lead to hair damage, including dryness, color fading, and split ends. To protect your hair from harmful UV rays, wear a hat or a scarf when you’re outside for extended periods. Additionally, you can use hair products that contain UV filters to provide an extra layer of protection against sun damage. Pro Tip: Apply a leave-in conditioner with UV protection before heading to the beach or spending the day outdoors. 4. Rinse After Swimming Chlorine from pools and saltwater from the ocean can strip your hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry and prone to damage. Always rinse your hair with fresh water immediately after swimming to remove any residual chlorine or salt. Follow up with a gentle shampoo and conditioner to restore moisture and protect your hair from potential damage. Pro Tip: Apply a leave-in conditioner before swimming to create a barrier against chlorine and saltwater. 5. Trim Regularly to Prevent Split Ends Regular trims are essential for maintaining healthy hair, especially during the summer when hair is more susceptible to damage. Schedule trims every 6-8 weeks to remove split ends and prevent them from traveling up the hair shaft, which can lead to more significant breakage. Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

    "title": "Review: Shure MoveMic Two Receiver Kit",
    "text": "Good quality content in 2024 is pretty much reliant on two main things, great ideas and quality gear to capture it. Whilst there are some specialised pieces of equipment geared towards content creators from some relatively new names in audio, having an industry stalwart such as Shure in the content creator game is kind of a big deal and with it a sense of legitimacy, especially when it comes to the requirements of audio equipment in this particular corner of the market. Having released some pretty exciting gear over the past few years such as the MV7+podcasting mic and the MV6 USB gaming mic, Shure have been making serious strides in the content creator world with these products being quickly adopted by many, but the pro audio veterans aren’t stopping there. Catch up on all the latest music gear reviews [here.](https://mixdownmag.com.au/reviews/) Having been established in broadcast for decades, namely with the iconic SM7B being a mainstay in this sphere, it’s no surprise with the epic rise of podcasting and other varieties of online content that these mics alone can be spotted in the studio spaces of some of the biggest names in podcasting. Whilst this has secured the brand’s name in this space, for the countless creatives who don’t have the luxury of a dedicated studio space, let alone the budget for one let alone a handful of these microphones, the SM7B may not be the most suitable option. With so much content being created in various locations and audiences still expecting “studio quality” production value, more compact, elegant and quality audio solutions have become a priority for those creating on the move. Shure have certainly recognised this and their new line of MoveMic solutions speaks to this directly. Far from being a compact lavalier mic, the new MoveMic is a compact clip-on mic system which boasts high fidelity audio transmitted wirelessly, direct to a connected device. Coming in three options being the MoveMic One, MoveMic Two and MoveMic Two Receiver Kit, each option caters to a variety of users from the solo creator/instructor, through to interviewers/journalists or the full kit for videographers and higher production needs. Designed by the same team of engineers behind Shure’s legendary wireless microphone systems which are used day-in day-out by some of the world’s bigger touring artists, festivals, production houses and venues, these petite little microphones mean business. Providing the ability to capture 2-channels of audio at 48kHz via Bluetooth is pretty wild and being spec’d with a 30m range is particularly impressive for field recordings and on location shoots where the capture device, be it a connected phone, computer or the MoveMic receiver (which is cold shoe mountable for easy attachment to cameras) is set up a distance away from the mics. What’s more, MoveMic transmits via Bluetooth, making setup for an interview or video shoot incredibly fast, alleviating the need to work with and attach cumbersome transmitters, a massive plus. Capturing audio from the MoveMic is equally as convenient as it seems the Shure team have gone to lengths to make this system as streamlined and user friendly as possible being able to near instantly start recording directing to your phone via one of the ShurePlus MOTIV apps. But for those with existing gear, setups and associated apps, simply connecting the MoveMic receiver via the included 3.5mm cable to a camera or via USB-C to a phone or computer is equally as easy and simple to set up. MoveMic Two Receiver Kit In practice, the MoveMic Two Receiver Kit really is dead simple to use. Wanting to see the differences between the ShurePlus MOTIV apps, I downloaded both the audio and video apps. Both were a breeze to set up and use immediately, pairing with the mics straight away I was recording in no time. The presets available for speech and singers I found were a solid starting point, with the ability to quickly tweak settings further with convenient control over gain, high pass filter, EQ and compression. Having the mics connected to my phone to BlueTooth via the app there was some latency, as to be expected when monitoring with headphones, but this wasn’t a big deal and in reality when using these mics for the intended scenarios you’d typically just be checking monitoring for levels and tweaking a couple of settings before hitting record anyway. Both apps are well laid out, intuitive and incredibly easy to use, with clear indications for input level, metering, input monitoring and muting of the mics. The ability to custom name the connected mics both within the app and on the MoveMic receiver as well as the captured media is super useful too, helping keep track of things in editing and post. The noise reduction feature works really well, and as for the audio quality, it’s pretty damn impressive. Voice was incredibly clear and I didn’t find it was overly hyped or brittle sounding, but rather nicely isolated, crisp, detailed and polished, with little or no need for further processing. This neat mic kit is a game changer for content creators and for those needing an affordable high quality solution for their audio needs particularly for those creating content on the move need not look further. The convenient carry pouch makes the MoveMic Receiver Kit ideal for throwing in the backpack or production kit with all the included accessories being practical, well thought out and never feeling overdone. With a total of 24 hours record time available (8 hours per mic with 2 charges from the charging case) there’s very little the MoveMic Receiver Kit doesn’t cover, if only it could take care of editing your content too.

    "text": "- Posibilidad de intrusión en el territorio aéreo de la OTAN Según Informes, la instalación de la OTAN en Geilenkirchen, la base aérea de Renania del Norte-Westfalia, ha pasado al segundo nivel más alto de alerta de seguridad. A continuación, lo que sabemos hasta ahora: LA SITUACIÓN La Escena: La Fuerza de Advertencia Temprana y Control de la OTAN estacionada en Geilenkirchen cerca de Aquisgrán ha elevado su nivel de alerta a Charlie. Como precaución, se ha aconsejado a los personal no esencial que se queden en casa, según el portavoz de la base. Esta decisión se basa en advertencias de inteligencia que sugieren un posible riesgo. Nivel de Alerta Charlie: En este nivel de seguridad, se ha producido un evento o hay una alta probabilidad de atentados terroristas contra la alianza. \"Esto no es motivo de preocupación y es simplemente una medida precautoria para poder continuar con nuestras actividades vitales\", aclaró el portavoz. El nivel más alto, Delta, se activa una vez que se ha producido o es inminente un atentado terrorista. La Base: La OTAN opera su plataforma de advertencia aérea AWACS en Geilenkirchen. Esta base alberga catorce aviones Boeing 707 reconfigurados que escanean el espacio aéreo en busca de posibles amenazas y alertan a la alianza. La unidad multinacional realiza tanto vigilancia aérea como marítima y actúa como centro de mando volador en operaciones. La unidad ha participado en diversas operaciones, incluyendo las del Balkanes y Afganistán. Después de la invasión rusa de Ucrania, la OTAN desplegó temporalmente aviones en Rumanía. Investigación: La policía de Colonia asumió el control de la investigación por la noche. No se han revelado más detalles sobre el número de fuerzas desplegadas. Un reportero de dpa observó vehículos policiales en el lugar. Alertas Previas: En julio, se habló de una mayor vigilancia en las bases militares de EE. UU. en Alemania y otros países europeos debido a advertencias terroristas. CNN informó de que el nivel de seguridad más alto, Charlie, se había elevado en estas bases durante el fin de semana. La naturaleza de la amenaza alegada no se reveló. LO QUE NO ESTÁ CLARO El Origen de la Alerta: Las razones detrás del aumento del nivel de alerta en Geilenkirchen siguen inciertas. Ni la policía, el Ministerio de Defensa ni la OTAN han compartido ninguna información al respecto. Posibles Conexiones: Esta semana se informaron varios drones volando sobre una zona industrial en Brunsbüttel. El origen y los objetivos de los drones siguen desconocidos. No está claro si esto está relacionado con el aumento del nivel de alerta en Geilenkirchen. De manera similar, la conexión entre los incidentes de sabotaje en varios sitios militares alemanes la semana pasada y la alerta en Geilenkirchen sigue sin aclararse. Después de la investigación, se reanudaron las operaciones normales en estos sitios. La policía y la protección del estado llevaron a cabo una investigación en Colonia-Wahn después de que se sospechara de contaminación del agua en las instalaciones de agua de la base de la fuerza aérea.

Abogo por más información directa, concreta, constante, para que poco a poco los sinvergüenzas queden cada vez más arrinconados en una sociedad cada vez más autocrítica.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Hasta que te informas y resulta que te obligan a hacer chorrocientos trámites y papeleos, además de visitas a parroquias buscando tu registro. Este coñazo echa a mucha gente para atrás.\nYa que en Hacienda se integran tan bien con la iglesia para la X del IRPF, a ver cuándo ponen otra casilla al lado de \"QUIERO APOSTATAR\".\n[#4](c4#c-4) [#2](c2#c-2) https://www.google.com/amp/s/cadenaser.com/nacional/2023/04/06/apostatar-en-espana-sin-datos-oficiales-y-con-un-proceso-relativamente-sencillo-cadena-ser/%3foutputType=amp gracias a los 2, al menos me habéis hecho replantearme la necesidad de intentarlo.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Me parece estupendo, pero no creo que tenga consecuencias reales.\nLo que hay que hacer es no darles ni un céntimo, ni a nivel particular, ni desde el gobierno, aunque esto es bastante difícil hoy por hoy.\nY hacer proselitismo del ateísmo como si fuera otra religión, que mucha gente simplemente pasa.\nDe toda maneras, tienen tal capital inmobiliario, que es imposible dejarles en la ruina. Como suelo decir, se van a convertir en una multinacional inmobiliaria.",
