The scheduled game between LG Twins and Lotte Giants was called off as temperatures soared above 35 degrees Celsius. This marks a significant event influenced by rising average annual temperatures. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 02-08-2024 14:27 IST | Created: 02-08-2024 14:27 IST South Korea's professional baseball league cancelled a scheduled game on Friday due to extreme temperatures. This marks the first instance in the league's 42-year history where a game was called off because of excessive heat. The match between LG Twins and Lotte Giants was to take place in Ulsan, but was cancelled as local temperatures surpassed 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). The Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) official noted that ground temperatures in the Ulsan stadium exceeded 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day. The extreme heat event follows a week after the conclusion of the monsoon season, which brought flooding and landslides to the central regions. Experts and officials have indicated that South Korea, which typically has four distinct seasons, is experiencing warmer annual temperatures. Several regions have been under daily heat warnings since July 21, issued when highs surpass 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit). (With inputs from agencies.)",

In honor of World Refugee Day, Airbnb.org continues to expand housing support for refugees.\nExpanding housing pathways for refugees\nSince its founding, Airbnb.org has provided over 1.4 million nights of free, temporary housing to more than 210,000 refugees and asylum seekers, including Zyad and Souzan.1\nZyad and Souzan fled civil war in Syria and then lived for over a decade as refugees in Jordan, where life was difficult. Thanks to the generosity of Airbnb.org hosts, partners, and donors, Zyad, Souzan, and their four children were able to start anew in Connecticut. Upon arrival, the family stayed for free in an apartment they found through Airbnb.org. They arrived five days before Ramadan and were surprised to find the refrigerator stocked with dates and other staples for Suhoor, the pre-fasting meal Muslims eat before sunrise during the holy month.\nZyad and Souzan’s Airbnb.org stay was made possible through a $2 million Sponsorship Initiative Airbnb.org\nlaunched last year on World Refugee Day. Sponsors provide emotional and financial support to refugees resettling in the US and help them adjust to life in their new community, but identifying housing is often a challenge. Airbnb.org’s Sponsorship Initiative helps address this barrier by providing grants for housing support to select refugee-focused nonprofit organizations that connect newcomers with sponsors in the US.\nThe sponsorship group supporting Zyad and Souzan has helped them transition to life in a new place. Led by Sue and Mike Sames in partnership with\nIntegrated Refugee & Immigrant Services (IRIS), a Connecticut-based nonprofit, the group has helped them fill out essential paperwork, enroll the children in school, apply for jobs, and secure permanent housing.\nAirbnb.org’s work with refugees like Zyad and Souzan would not be possible without the support of Airbnb hosts, partner organizations, and donors. To date, over 43,000 hosts across 167 countries have opted in to welcome refugees in need through Airbnb.org.\nJay Carney joins Airbnb.org’s Board of Directors\nAs Airbnb.org continues to scale its work with refugees and others displaced around the world, Airbnb.org is excited to welcome Jay Carney, Global Head of Policy and Communications at Airbnb, on its Board of Directors. Consisting of seven leaders spanning the technology, design, nonprofit, academic, and global humanitarian sectors, Airbnb.org’s\nBoard of Directors guide its work and mission.\nJay brings a wealth of experience in both the public and private sector. Prior to joining Airbnb, Jay established and led Amazon’s Global Corporate Affairs organization for seven years, overseeing public policy, communications, and community engagement, including investments in affordable housing, disaster response, and refugee relief. He joined Amazon from the White House, where he served as press secretary to President Obama from 2011 to 2014 and, before that, as director of communications for then-Vice President Joe Biden. Jay also sits on the board of the Urban Institute, a research organization focused on housing and equity, as well as Human Rights First, which supports asylum-seekers and combats violent extremism and human rights abuses worldwide.\n“Airbnb.org is a powerful example of how technology can be a force for good. I’m honored to be part of Airbnb.org’s efforts to support communities in times of crisis by providing people free, temporary housing as they rebuild their lives.”\n—Jay Carney, Head of Policy and Communications at Airbnb and Airbnb.org Board Member\nSupporting Airbnb.org’s work with refugees\nAs a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Airbnb.org relies heavily on the generosity of donors and its broader community to continue providing temporary housing to families like Zyad and Souzan.

    "title": "Munich Re Pioneers Parametric Insurance Solutions for Natural Catastrophes",
    "text": "In a significant move that underscores the growing importance of innovative insurance solutions in the face of escalating climate-related risks, Munich Re, a titan in the reinsurance industry, has unveiled its latest strategic initiative. The company has established a global parametric team dedicated to fine-tuning natural catastrophe risk transfer solutions. This move is not just a testament to Munich Re's commitment to leadership in the reinsurance market but also a clear signal of the sector's dynamic shift towards parametric insurance solutions. With the recent appointment of Oliver Kaufmann as Senior Underwriter at Munich Re in Japan, the company is not only bolstering its expertise but also its geographic footprint, especially in regions vulnerable to natural catastrophes.\nThe Dawn of a New Era in Catastrophe Risk Management\nParametric insurance represents a paradigm shift in how we approach risk management for natural disasters. Unlike traditional insurance, which typically involves assessing and compensating for losses after they occur, parametric solutions offer a proactive approach. These innovative insurance products trigger payouts based on predefined parameters, such as the magnitude of an earthquake or the speed of a cyclone, ensuring swift post-disaster liquidity. This is particularly critical in regions like Southeast Asia, where the insurance penetration rates are alarmingly low, especially in the agricultural sector. In these areas, the aftermath of a natural catastrophe can be devastating, with many farmers lacking the necessary financial protection against such unpredictable events.\nExpanding Horizons: Munich Re's Strategic Focus on Asia\nMunich Re's recent endeavors, including the formation of the global parametric team and the strategic placement of Oliver Kaufmann in Japan, signal a focused effort to address the unique challenges faced by regions vulnerable to climate risks. Kaufmann, whose career at New Reinsurance Company Ltd. (NewRe) spanned a decade across various pivotal roles, brings a wealth of experience and insight into the parametric insurance market. His expertise will be instrumental in Munich Re's quest to educate and provide effective risk transfer solutions to the agricultural markets in East Asia, including South Korea, Japan, and China. The region's increasing exposure to climate risks makes it a critical area for the deployment of parametric insurance solutions, which can offer a lifeline to those affected by natural catastrophes.\nMunich Re's Vision for the Future of Insurance\nThe formation of Munich Re's global parametric team and the strategic appointment of Oliver Kaufmann underscore the company's vision for the future of insurance. By focusing on parametric solutions for natural catastrophe risk transfer, Munich Re is not only addressing the immediate needs for post-catastrophe liquidity but also pioneering a shift towards more resilient and sustainable risk management practices. This initiative reflects a broader trend in the reinsurance industry towards embracing innovative solutions that can meet the challenges posed by a changing climate. As the market for parametric insurance continues to evolve, Munich Re's efforts in regions like Southeast Asia could play a pivotal role in shaping the future of global risk management.\nIn conclusion, Munich Re's establishment of a global parametric team, coupled with the strategic appointment of Oliver Kaufmann in Japan, marks a significant milestone in the reinsurance industry's journey towards innovative and sustainable risk management solutions. By focusing on the dynamic and still-evolving market for parametric natural catastrophe risk transfer solutions, Munich Re is not only demonstrating its leadership in the reinsurance sector but also its commitment to addressing the pressing challenges posed by climate change. As the company continues to expand its presence and expertise in the parametric insurance market, its efforts could herald a new era of resilience and protection for vulnerable regions across the globe.",

    "text": "MANILA, Philippines – Outgoing Ateneo Blue Eagle Jared Brown said he thinks it is already “God’s plan” for him to turn pro and leave the collegiate ranks after a season in the UAAP.\nBrown last week announced that he will be leaving Ateneo to possibly turn professional.\nIt was a surprising announcement, as this turned the shifty guard to a one-and-done prospect for the Blue Eagles, which also lost Kai Ballungay.\nBallungay also announced his decision to turn pro a few weeks ago.\n“I definitely could have come back for one more year, it wasn’t really do or die but I just felt… I had the gut feeling of leaving my old school in the States for Ateneo and I really trusted God’s plan and it worked out,” Brown said in an interview aired over CNN Philippines’ Sports Desk.\n“I feel like this is God’s plan for me to start my next chapter in life,” he added.\nBrown earlier played for the Westmont College in California.\nHe then became one of the main guns for the Katipunan-based squad in UAAP Season 86.\nIn the elimination round, Brown averaged 9.1 points, 2.2 assists and 1.6 rebounds per game.\nHe helped the Blue Eagles reach the Final Four, but they were eliminated by finalists UP Fighting Maroons.\nThe lefty combo guard underscored that his decision was tough for him, especially since he still has one more year left.\nHowever, he reiterated that he is ready to go pro.\n“It was my first year in the UAAP, but I played for three years in the states so for me, I was getting a little older with me being 23. So I thought it was time,” he said.\nThe Ateneo coaching staff, including head coach Tab Baldwin, also told him that he is already ready to take the next step, the guard bared.\nWith the departures of Brown and Ballungay, Ateneo will be led by Chris Koon and Mason Amos in Season 87.",
