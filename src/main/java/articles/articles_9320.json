    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Remote Kiwi Population Growing For First Time In Conservation History Kiwi numbers are increasing in a remote part of Fiordland for the first time in the history of their conservation, thanks to recent aerial predator control operations. Ranger holding up a Kiwi. Photo:Belle Gwilliam, DoC The population of Fiordland tokoeka at Shy Lake is growing about 2% per year, officially turning the tide and reversing their decline. DOC’s Project Lead for Tokoeka / Kiwi Chris Dodd says 2% represents a significant win for the species at a population level. “It means not only are chicks surviving long enough to replace the adults, enough are making it to adulthood to officially grow the population.” Prior to the use of 1080 bait to control predators, chick survival in the area was zero. Every year kiwi chicks were hatching and dying, overwhelmingly due to stoat predation. The Shy Lake population, which DOC has been monitoring since 2017, is representative of the wider Wet Jacket peninsula – what happens there, is happening across the entire area, Chris says. “Adult kiwi are typically more resilient to stoat attacks, but natural mortality - old age, misadventure, disease - means the population was declining by about 2% per year with no chicks surviving to replace the adults. “Without action, the Shy Lake kiwi population was on a downward slide to extinction.” The first ever aerial 1080 operation in this remote area took place in winter 2020. It successfully knocked back stoats for the following year, before they began to reinvade from untreated neighbouring areas. A second operation took place in winter 2023. So far, there has been no stoat predation on this season’s chicks, but there have been some deaths due to weather and misadventure. “Fiordland tokoeka live in harsh, rugged terrain. Even without the threat of predation, it can be an uphill battle surviving through to adulthood. We can’t control the environment, but we can do something about the stoats and give these chicks a better chance. And these latest population figures show it’s working.” Alongside the Shy Lake kiwi study, DOC has also been documenting the efforts to save this species in a three-part miniseries called the Fiordland Kiwi Diaries, released in winter 2023. It highlights the challenges of undertaking critical conservation work in some of the country’s remotest, most unforgiving terrain. Chris Dodd says it's important to never underestimate the challenges faced in caring for these taonga. “Shy Lake and Wet Jacket Peninsula are beautiful but remote – most people will never set foot in the place. But that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t know about what’s happening there, so it was great to be able to bring the public along on the journey with us.” One of this season’s chicks has also recently reached 1kg – or what’s known as “stoat safe weight” months earlier than would normally be expected. This is likely due to the healthy number of invertebrates available for kiwi to eat that aren’t being lost to introduced predators. While the tide may be turning for the Shy Lake and wider Wet Jacket Peninsula population, there’s still plenty of work to do to reverse the decline across the whole species. Currently only around a quarter of Fiordland tokoeka habitat receives any type of predator control, and the Wet Jacket Peninsula is only about 4.5% of their total habitat. We need to think bigger if we’re going to stop the decline of Fiordland tokoeka overall, says Chris. The next step is a predator control operation at the Seaforth-Grebe block, east of the Wet Jacket Peninsula, which is currently planned for winter 2024. Alongside the Fiordland tokoeka, it will also protect rockwren, kea, mohua, long-tailed bats and several types of native snails. “Despite the challenge ahead, we’ve made a great start. The purpose of the study was to find out how to protect these remote kiwi populations and we now know it’s an effective method for protecting tokoeka kiwi.",

Syracuse University Food Services [issued](https://www.instagram.com/sufoodservices/p/C2iXTYgJdHS/?hl=en) an apology over a post it made regarding the university’s 39th Annual MLK Dinner. Before the apology was issued, Food Services deleted the previous post, which detailed the food that was served at the dinner. The graphic, originally published on Wednesday, stated the catering team served 700 pounds of fried chicken, 150 gallons of lemonade, 100 square feet of chocolate cake, 130 gallons of mac & cheese and 275 dozen corn muffins for the event. To the left of the list was a drawing of Martin Luther King Jr. “To celebrate our catering colleagues’ contributions to the annual MLK Celebration, we shared a post highlighting some of the foods that were made for the event. We recognize that our content was insensitive, and we regret that our actions have negatively impacted the people we serve every day,” Food Services wrote in the Instagram post published Thursday afternoon. Food Services added that students, faculty, staff and community members on the MLK Celebration planning committee selected the menu and “worked hard to be inclusive.” When asked for comment, a university spokesperson directed The Daily Orange to the statement shared by Food Services. Instagram account [barstoolcuse](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2iS_pIP7NP/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) posted a screenshot of the original post on Thursday afternoon and, as of 4:30 p.m., it has over 1,000 likes.

    "title": "Sweden Finally Joins NATO in Expansion Spurred by Putin’s Ukraine War - The Japan News",
    "text": "Sweden officially joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Thursday, a historic shift that highlights how Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is transforming European security in ways he may not have foreseen. At a meeting in Washington, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson deposited the final paperwork with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the last step needed for the former militarily nonaligned nation to become NATO’s 32nd member. Sweden’s neighbor, Finland, joined last year. To justify his aggression in Ukraine, Putin cited the possibility of NATO expansion. Now, in one of the conflict’s many twists, his war has brought a bigger, stronger alliance to his door. Russia will have to live with the consequences for years. “There is no clearer example today of the strategic debacle that Ukraine has become for Russia,” Blinken said Thursday, standing beside an elated Kristersson. “Everything that Putin sought to prevent, he has actually precipitated by his actions, by his aggression.” The addition of Sweden and Finland will strengthen NATO in the far north, where Russia keeps much of it second-strike nuclear capability, and boost its presence around the Baltic Sea, particularly around the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Sweden’s navy has experience operating in – and under – Baltic waters, and its fighter jets will patrol the region’s skies, making it easier for NATO to supply or defend Baltic allies, should the need arise. Stockholm has already said it will send troops to join a multinational force based in Latvia. “Sweden’s accession makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer, and the whole Alliance more secure,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on X. Kristersson said it was a “historic moment” and pledged that his country would meet the alliance’s defense spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product from this year onward. “Unity and solidarity will be Sweden’s guiding light as a NATO member,” he said. “We will share burdens, responsibilities and risks with other allies.” Although Sweden’s NATO bid was blocked at various points by Turkey, and then by Hungary, its admission Thursday sends an important signal to Putin as he wages war in Ukraine and threatens other neighbors, said Anna Wieslander, director for Northern Europe at the Atlantic Council. That message: “That he cannot dictate, and if he does, there will be pushback.” Russia did not immediately comment on the news. The country’s response to Finnish membership was muted, though Russian officials have talked in general terms about the need to adjust their military posture in response to NATO’s new borders and plans. A few years ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Sweden joining NATO. Military nonalignment was a part of the country’s identity. But Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine seemed to rouse Europe from a post-Cold War slumber, spurring deep changes in how the region’s relatively wealthy democracies think about their own security. The European Union began the process of weaning itself off Russian oil and gas. It dug into its stockpiles to send weapons to Ukraine. And it has started to step up defense spending – albeit more slowly than many at NATO headquarters or in Washington might like. NATO, meanwhile, began its biggest overhaul since the Cold War, drawing up new battle plans that are more squarely focused on deterring Russia and defending every inch of NATO territory from day one should Moscow try anything. When Russian tanks rolled on Kyiv, Finnish sentiment about NATO shifted quickly. Sweden took slightly longer to come around but applied for membership alongside its neighbor in May 2022. In his remarks Thursday, Blinken noted that most Swedes were not interested in NATO before Russia’s invasion but that Moscow’s actions prompted a dramatic rethink. “Swedes realized something very profound,” he said, “that if Putin was trying to erase one neighbor from the map, then he might not stop there.” Both countries – and much of the alliance – expected a smooth accession process. But approving newcomers requires unanimity, and it soon became clear that Turkey would object at every step. What followed was more than 20 months of obstruction and delay from Turkey, followed by stalling from Hungary – public feuding that no doubt pleased Putin. When it became clear that Turkey’s problem was with Sweden, not Finland, their bids were split. Finland joined last spring, while Sweden kept negotiating. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sought F-16 fighter jets from the United States and insisted that Sweden crack down on groups that Turkey considers to be terrorists. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban pressed Sweden’s prime minister to visit Budapest and cut a deal to get more Swedish-built fighter jets. In the end, after much drama and fraught diplomacy, both countries extracted what they could and agreed to welcome another new member. The Swedish flag will not rise outside NATO’s Brussels headquarters until Monday, officials said, but NATO’s key protection – the collective defense clause known as Article 5 – goes into effect immediately. “We will go to sleep here tonight with Article 5 embracing this country,” Wieslander, of the Atlantic Council, said in a phone call from Sweden. “That is a huge shift for us.”",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "El expresidente Donald Trump dijo el jueves que, si es elegido para un segundo mandato en noviembre, despediría inmediatamente al fiscal especial Jack Smith, quien presentó dos acusaciones federales en su contra.\nEl presentador de radio conservador Hugh Hewitt le preguntó a Trump si planea indultarse a sí mismo o despedir a Smith el día en que tomará juramento.\n“Es tan fácil, lo despediría en dos segundos”, dijo Trump, quien agregó que obtuvo “inmunidad en la Corte Suprema” y llamó a Smith una “persona corrupta”.\nEl expresidente también dijo que no cree que los demócratas, si recuperan la mayoría en la Cámara, lo sometan a un juicio político si despide a Smith del Departamento de Justicia.\nEstados Unidos 2 Oct Trump “recurrió a delitos para intentar permanecer en el cargo”, según el fiscal Smith Estados Unidos 27 Ago Fiscal presenta nueva versión de caso penal contra Trump tras fallo de impunidad presidencial La oficina de Smith se negó a hacer comentarios sobre las declaraciones de Trump. Despedirlo como fiscal especial podría potencialmente poner fin al procesamiento del gobierno federal contra Trump.\nSi bien Smith apeló el fallo en Florida que desestimó el caso de documentos clasificados contra el expresidente, el fiscal especial todavía está llevando adelante el caso de interferencia electoral en su contra en Washington, D.C.\nTrump ha retrasado con éxito los procedimientos judiciales en el caso de interferencia electoral debido a sus reclamos de inmunidad presidencial, que finalmente fueron resueltos por la Corte Suprema en julio, por lo que no se ha fijado un juicio en el caso.\nLa jueza Tanya Chutkan permitió la publicación de cientos de páginas de documentos muy censurados la semana pasada que contenían evidencia que el fiscal especial estaba usando para el procesamiento.\nEn respuesta, Trump llamó a Chutkan “la persona más malvada” y a Smith “un cachorro enfermo” y calificó la liberación como una “interferencia electoral”.\nEl expresidente los ha menospreciado a ambos en numerosas ocasiones, lo que llevó al juez a emitir una orden de censura contra él. Prohibía a Trump hacer declaraciones sobre posibles testigos o los fiscales federales que lo acusaron.\nEl año pasado, Trump advirtió que Smith y otros funcionarios del Departamento de Justicia terminarían en una institución mental si es reelegido.\nEn un esfuerzo por anticiparse a cualquier movimiento de Trump si regresa a la Casa Blanca, el representante Adam Schiff, demócrata por California, un feroz crítico de Trump, presentó una legislación el mes pasado con copatrocinadores demócratas que impediría que un presidente en funciones desestime un proceso penal activo en su contra, una medida que no irá a ninguna parte en la Cámara controlada por los republicanos.\nEste artículo se publicó originalmente en inglés en NBC News .
