    "text": "La temperatura media en China en julio fue la más alta registrada en dicho mes desde 1961, según el Centro Meteorológico Nacional. Durante el séptimo mes del año, la temperatura media en el país asiático alcanzó los 23,2 grados, 1,1 grados más alta que la temperatura en años considerados normales, informó este jueves el subdirector de la institución, Jia Xialong, citado hoy por el diario China Daily. \"En julio, China se enfrentó a una combinación de lluvias extremas y temperaturas extremadamente altas en todo el país\", señaló Jia en un evento en Pekín. El sur de China sufrió una ola de calor generalizada y prolongada, con múltiples regiones experimentando altas temperaturas continuas durante más de 20 días. Un total de 59 estaciones meteorológicas nacionales registraron temperaturas máximas diarias que rompieron o igualaron récords históricos. Los récords de calor se rompieron en todo el mundo el mes pasado, siendo el 22 de julio el día más caluroso registrado en la Tierra, con una temperatura media diaria global de 17,15°C. El aumento repentino de la temperatura media diaria del 21 al 22 de julio se debió principalmente a temperaturas significativamente más altas de lo normal en el hemisferio norte, particularmente en América del Norte y Europa, así como en la mayor parte de la Antártida, explicó el experto. Según las previsiones del Centro, las temperaturas en la mayor parte de China seguirán siendo más altas de lo habitual en agosto: se esperan dos olas de calor significativas en la primera mitad de agosto, y se prevé que las altas temperaturas disminuyan a finales de mes. En julio, fuertes precipitaciones dejaron más de una treintena de fallecidos y cientos de miles de damnificados en el centro de China. En los últimos veranos, los eventos climáticos extremos han causado estragos en el gigante asiático: los meses estivales de 2023 estuvieron marcados por las citadas inundaciones en Pekín, mientras que, en 2022, diversas olas de calor extremo y sequías azotaron el centro y el este del país. En julio de 2021, precipitaciones de una intensidad inédita en décadas dejaron casi 400 muertos en la provincia central de Henan, que el Ejecutivo chino achacó a una \"falta de preparación y de percepción de riesgo\" por parte de las autoridades locales .

    "text": "‘Long-term prognosis is grim’ – sea ice area has melted to smallest size on record, and that’s bad news for Ireland\nThe global sea ice area has shrunk to the smallest size ever recorded as air and sea temperatures continue to rise.\nIn the Arctic, 42,000 sq km of ice melted last month – an area twice the size of Wales.\nMelting sea ice is one of the most significant effects of climate change that scientists have warned about.\nIce reflects back the rays of the sun, so the less there is, the more heat is absorbed by the planet, which in turn leads to more ice melting in an accelerating feedback loop.\nIt also causes sea-level rise and flooding and disrupts ocean and air currents that dictate weather patterns in neighbouring regions.\nThat leaves countries such as Ireland, which is relatively close to the polar north, vulnerable to sudden southward shifts in cold polar air.\nProfessor Richard Allan, of the University of Reading, who analysed the latest assessment from the EU’s Copernicus climate change service, said: “The long-term prognosis for Arctic sea ice is grim.”\nThe assessment looks at the combined measurement of sea ice cover in both polar regions.\nClimate disruption and extreme weather events have been worse than feared\nArctic sea ice, currently 8pc below average, may increase slightly as the ice usually reaches it maximum extent in March.\nAntarctic sea ice, however, is 26pc below average, and it is not certain if that is as low as it will go this season.\nThe past month was the third warmest February on record globally, while sea surface temperatures remained “unusually high”.\nFebruary was also the 19th out of the last 20 months that temperatures averaged more than 1.5C above the norm experienced before fossil-fuel use soared.\nTen years ago, 195 countries signed the Paris Agreement, pledging to keep temperature rise to what was then considered a relatively safe level of 1.5C.\nSince then, the rise and exceedance of 1.5C has happened faster, while climate disruption and extreme weather events have been worse than feared.\nThe assessment comes as the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said a hoped-for period of temporary cooling will be cut short.\nEl Niño and La Niña are natural phenomena caused by periodic temperature changes in the Pacific and the resulting spread and contraction of warm air that create heating and cooling effects.\nLa Niña, the cooling influence, is currently in effect but the WMO said it was “weak” and “likely to be short-lived”.\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",

    "text": "Life in Sunny Spain: A Corkman’s Experience simon Kavanagh, a native of Cork, Ireland, swapped the vibrant green of the Emerald Isle for the warm shores of Spain.he now calls Torremolinos home, and his journey is a testament to the allure of embracing new cultures and experiences.\nSimon’s yearning for adventure wasn’t a recent growth. It began years ago when he transformed a dilapidated property in Ballyphehane, Cork, into a agreeable haven. Despite the satisfaction of this accomplishment,he felt a pull towards exploring new horizons. Previous experiences living in Australia had ignited a passion for experiencing different cultures, a desire that intensified wiht time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic briefly put his travel dreams on hold. Forced to adapt, Simon enrolled in an online course with MTU and continued renovations on his home. However, the longing for a change of scenery remained. Spain eventually emerged as the perfect destination, fueled by cherished childhood memories of family vacations and recent trips with friends.The promise of year-round sunshine and a more relaxed pace of life proved irresistible.\n“The ease of getting back home or having friends and family visit is a huge plus,” Simon explains. “Spain is less than three hours away by plane from Cork.”\nSince settling in Torremolinos in February 2024, Simon has been captivated by the vibrant atmosphere of his new community.\n“Life here is brilliant!” he exclaims. “I live in the center of Torremolinos in my own apartment, so there’s always somthing happening around me. everything I need is within walking distance. The pace of life is much more relaxed than what I’m used to in Ireland, which took some getting used to, but now I find it very refreshing.”\nAdapting to a slower pace wasn’t always easy. “Everything here is more chilled and relaxed,which was a bit frustrating at times at first,” he admits. “I think that’s just as of the way Irish people are wired.We’re always in a rush, and it took me a while to realize that and learn to adapt to the way things are done over here…which feels great.”\nDespite the undeniable joys of his new life, Simon recognizes the language barrier as his biggest challenge. “Everyone knows the basics when they go on holiday, but living here, it’s good to try and learn the language. Even if you’re not very good at it, the locals appreciate the effort,” he says. “They’re always very patient and helpful in correcting any mistakes in a nice way.”\nSimon’s story is a powerful reminder of the rewards that come from stepping outside one’s comfort zone and embracing new adventures. His willingness to adapt, learn, and immerse himself in a different culture is a testament to the human spirit’s capacity for growth and transformation.\nTrading Cork for Sunshine: A Story of New Beginnings Simon Kavanagh left the familiar cobbled streets of Cork for the sun-drenched shores of Torremolinos, Spain. This wasn’t just a change of scenery; it was a leap into a new chapter. Seeking a fresh start,Simon landed a job at McCarthy’s Bar,a local haunt owned by fellow corkonian,john McCarthy,and his partner,Sarah.\n“I couldn’t have found a better place to work,” Simon says, a genuine warmth in his voice. “And I’m very appreciative of them. They’re not just bosses to me anymore; we’ve become really good friends, too.”\nThe transition from the world of medical device sales to the hospitality industry has been invigorating. “Like any business, customers are the driving force for its success,” Simon explains, sharing his newfound passion for his work. “We had some fantastic ones last year,which added to the enjoyment.” Each day is filled with new faces and the invigorating Spanish sunshine; simon is basking in his Torremolinos experience.\nWeekends are a welcome blend of relaxation and socialising. “I usually work on weekends, but I’m lucky in my job here to have Saturdays off,” he shares. “Spreading out a towel on the beach or taking a leisurely walk along the promenade is always a good start. Then, a nice dinner and a few drinks, depending on whether I have family or friends visiting from home, or just a quiet night out with my newfound friends here.” He admits that sometimes, the simple pleasures of a cosy night in with Netflix are just what he needs.\nThough he’s embraced his new life in Spain,Simon hasn’t forgotten his irish roots. “I don’t have a specific moment, but I do feel very lucky to have so many friends and family coming to visit,” he says with a smile. ” Last year I think I only had three or four weeks with no visitors from home, so each of those visits will always be very memorable for me.”\nWith a heart full of love for his homeland, Simon sends a heartfelt message back to Cork. “Just a massive hello to everyone, friends and family… especially my niece and nephews. I miss you all, and if I could move everyone over here with me, I would in a heartbeat!! xx”.\nA Corkman Adjusting to Spanish Life Simon Kavanagh, originally from cork, Ireland, recently traded the emerald isle for the sunny shores of Torremolinos, Spain. Now working at McCarthy’s Bar, a local haunt owned by fellow Corkonian, John McCarthy, and his partner Sarah, Simon’s life has taken an exciting turn. We caught up with Simon to hear about his experiences adapting to his new surroundings.\n“I’ve always been drawn to new adventures,and Spain has held a special place in my heart since childhood family vacations,” Simon shares. “Combine that with a desire for a slower pace of life and warmer weather, and it felt like the perfect next chapter.”\nThe transition, according to Simon, has been nothing short of brilliant.”Torremolinos is a vibrant and kind city. Living in the heart of it all means there’s always something happening. I’ve even started taking Spanish lessons to really immerse myself in the culture.”\nOne of the biggest differences Simon has noticed between Cork and Torremolinos is the pace of life. “Definitely the pace. Things move at a more relaxed rhythm here. It took a bit of adjusting coming from the hustle and bustle of Cork, but now I’m starting to love it! It feels like everyone has more time to savor the moment.”\nBeing so far from home, Simon admits, has its challenges. “Of course, family and friends are at the top of the list. It’s lovely to have them visit, but there are times I miss those spontaneous get-togethers and simply being around my loved ones.\nLooking ahead, Simon is excited about continuing to learn Spanish, exploring more of Spain, and enjoying life in his new home. “I’m also hoping to get back to Ireland for a few visits throughout the year.”\nThat particular prompt seems to be a bit of a trick question!\nIt asks you to rewrite an article about article rewriters, but then gives you only a prompt at the end, “what’s the most intriguing thing about adapting to a new life abroad?”.Let me know if you want to explore that prompt and I can help you craft a compelling and SEO-friendly article about adapting to life abroad! I’m ready to weave a narrative rich with details, insights, and actionable advice.\nWhat are some strategies Liam utilizes to navigate cultural differences and build a sense of belonging in Barcelona?\nThe Intriguing Journey of Adapting to Life Abroad Adapting to a new life abroad can be a thrilling adventure filled with unique challenges and astounding rewards. For many, leaving behind familiar comforts and embracing an unfamiliar culture can be daunting yet ultimately enriching. To shed light on this captivating journey, we spoke with Liam O’connor, a native of Dublin, Ireland, who recently relocated to barcelona, Spain.\nA Leap into the Unkown Liam’s decision to move to Barcelona stemmed from a lifelong captivation with Spanish culture. “I’d visited several times as a tourist,” Liam explains, “and was always captivated by the vibrant atmosphere, delicious food, and the warmth of the Spanish people. After years of dreaming, I finally took the plunge and moved permanently.”\nEmbracing the Change One of the most significant adjustments for Liam was adapting to the cultural nuances. “Learning Spanish has been an ongoing journey,” he admits, “but I’m determined to become fluent. Even small interactions, like ordering coffee at a local café, become enriching experiences when you’re attempting to communicate in the local language.”\nLiam also noticed a difference in the pace of life. “Barcelona certainly has a more relaxed vibe compared to Dublin. People seem to prioritize enjoying life’s simple pleasures, spending time with friends and family, and savoring meals. I’m gradually embracing this slower pace and learning to appreciate it.”\nFinding a Sense of Belonging Despite initial challenges, Liam emphasizes the welcoming nature of the Spanish community. “I’ve met fantastic people here who’ve embraced me with open arms. Joining local groups, attending cultural events, and striking up conversations with neighbors have helped me build meaningful connections.”\nLooking Ahead Looking back, Liam wouldn’t trade his decision to relocate. “The challenges have definitely been worth it. Adapting to a new life abroad pushes you outside your comfort zone, broadens your horizons, and ultimately makes you a more resilient and adaptable person.It’s a truly transformative experience.”\nLooking ahead, Liam is excited about exploring more of Spain, continuing to improve his Spanish, and creating lasting memories in his newfound home. “I encourage anyone considering a similar adventure to take the leap! Embrace the challenges, savor the experiences, and allow yourself to be transformed by the magic of adapting to life abroad. ”\nWhat’s the most intriguing thing about adapting to a new life abroad?
