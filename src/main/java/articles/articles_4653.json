    "text": "【大公報訊】記者張銳報道：旺角大球場昨晚上演國際足球友誼賽，由中國香港隊主場迎戰中國澳門隊。港足於上半場便鎖定勝局，憑着鐘樂安的建功和李小恆的首次國際賽「地標」入球而贏2：0，取得國際賽7連勝。\n開賽初段，澳門反客為主，佔據控球權之餘兼有3次射門機會。15分鐘後，港足才逐漸控制形勢，在前鋒安永佳錯失兩次絕佳機會後，憑着鐘樂安於27分鐘接應黃威開出的角球近門建功成1：0。40分鐘，港足擴大領先優勢，艾華頓在右路禁區展現超強個人能力後地波傳中，伏兵前柱的李小恆輕鬆撞入成2：0。\n易邊再戰，港足後備入替的茹子楠、孫銘謙、余在言等都表現出色，連接製造入球機會，但皆無功而還。最終，港足保持2：0的勝局至完場。",

De acordo com o sindicato, a suspensão, decidida em assembleia, valerá até que a empresa apresente nova proposta de jornada de trabalho na próxima quarta-feira (4).\nÉ + que streaming. É arte, cultura e história.\nOs funcionários estavam parados desde o início da semana em protesto contra a implantação da jornada 6x1 – seis dias de trabalho por um de folga, assim como a jornada 6x2.\nNa unidade de Itaquera, os trabalhadores continuam em greve e a empresa opera parcialmente.\nA decisão pela paralisação foi motivada, segundo o sindicato da categoria, pela postura intransigente da empresa e recusa em dialogar sobre a jornada de trabalho. Na próxima segunda-feira (2), está marcada audiência no TRT-2.\n“Diante da tentativa arbitrária da PepsiCo de implementar a jornada 6x1 e 6x2, propusemos a jornada de trabalho espanhola como alternativa [alternar entre uma semana de 48 horas e uma semana de 40 horas]. Porém, mesmo com nossas insistentes solicitações para um diálogo construtivo, a empresa se manteve inflexível”, divulgou o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Indústrias de Laticínios e Alimentação de São Paulo e Região (Stilasp).\nO tema ganhou repercussão nacional em novembro em razão da proposta de Emenda à Constituição Federal (PEC), de autoria da deputada federal Erika Hilton (PSol-SP), que propõe jornada de trabalho de, no máximo, 36 horas semanais e quatro dias de trabalho por semana no Brasil.\nEmpresa\nA PepsiCo disse, em nota, que “cumpre rigorosamente as leis do país e, ainda que em discussão no Congresso, a jornada 6x1 está de acordo com a legislação brasileira em vigor.”\n“A PepsiCo permanece aberta ao diálogo com seus colaboradores e representantes sindicais em busca de soluções equilibradas para todas as partes, reafirmando o seu cuidado e compromisso com as pessoas com base em relações éticas e responsáveis que sempre orientam as suas decisões”, informou.\n[Fale com a gente](https://www.opovo.com.br/falecomagente)",

    "text": "New Delhi: Following reports of hate graffiti being sprayed on a Swaminarayan temple in California, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar said that India has lodged a complaint with the United States and urged action.\nAccording to the police department in Newark, California, a report was received on Friday (December 22) morning that graffiti had been sprayed on the compound wall and signpost of the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu temple.\nThe graffiti included the word ‘Khalistan’, as per photos circulated on social media.\nSpeaking to reporters in Gandhinagar on the sidelines of the convocation at Rashtriya Raksha University, Jaishankar said that India has formally lodged a protest with the United States and reiterated that extremists and separatist forces targeting India should not get space outside the country.\n“I have seen the news. As you know, we are concerned about this. Extremists and separatist forces outside India should not get space. Our consulate has lodged a complaint with the [US] government and the police there over whatever happened, and I believe the matter is being inquired,” he was Quote: d as saying by PTI.\nThe Indian consulate in San Francisco denounced the alleged vandalism of the temple.\nWe strongly condemn the defacing of SMVS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir at Newark, California with anti-India graffiti. This incident has hurt the sentiments of the Indian community. We have pressed for quick investigation and prompt action against the vandals by the US authorities in…\n— India in SF (@CGISFO) December 23, 2023\nAccording to PTI, the Newark police said any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority.\nEarlier this year, there were a series of reports of graffiti being sprayed on temples in Australia and cities in other parts of the Western world.\nIn September, the Times of India reported that in one of the cases, Australian investigators had proposed that Hindus may have defaced their own temple after intentionally shutting off CCTV cameras.\nDocuments pertaining to the investigation that compiled internal deliberations were released in response to a right to information application by an Australian Sikh author.\nWhile one theory pursued was of a Hindu being behind the graffiti to incite hatred, no evidence was ultimately found.\nAnother part of the documents also talked of a theory involving “Sikh involvement” linked to an upcoming so-called referendum.\nAnother report filed by The Australia Today , a local media outlet focused on multicultural communities and the Indian subcontinent, Quote: d a Victoria Police spokesperson as saying that it had exhausted all avenues of investigation and found no suspects.\nMake ",

Democrats are systematically altering America’s demographics to make the country more like the hellhole Haiti :\nSince fiscal 2021, more than 485,000 Haitian illegal border crossers, a record, have been reported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nThat’s only the ones who are reported.\nGiving an indication of what we can expect under a Harris/Walz regime, the trend line is shooting straight up:\nThe overwhelming majority were reported this fiscal year, nearly 216,000, compared to 48,727 in fiscal 2021.\nOnce they are here, Democrats make sure they stay:\nAdditionally, since July, 205,000 Haitians have been released through the CHNV parole program, according to CBP data . Of the more than 765,000 illegal foreign nationals released into the country through the CBP One app, the top nationality is Haitian. Through these programs, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also extended Temporary Permanent Status to them and granted work authorization.\nBut isn’t it illegal to facilitate the colonization of our country by unlawful invaders? Of course it is:\nAll of these programs are illegal, state attorneys general who’ve sued to stop them, argue. U.S. House Republicans also cited them as among the many illegal actions Mayorkas caused them to impeach him. Mayorkas has since only expanded the programs and extended TPS .\nRuined Springfield is not alone:\nIn Sylacauga, Alabama, residents have been demanding answers about busloads of Haitians being dropped into their community.\nElsewhere in Alabama,\nIn Coffee County, one resident claimed, “30,000 illegal aliens are scheduled to arrive in the first week of October, 1,000 of them in Baldwin County,” and that human trafficking was involved, 1819 News reported .\nThey say Pennsylvania is like Alabama, except with moonbat-infested Philadelphia at one end and Pittsburgh at the other turning it into a swing state. If Democrats remain in power, Alabama and Pennsylvania will both be like Haiti:\nIn Charleroi, Penn., the immigrant population has grown “by over 2,000% in just the last two years,” primarily due to a Haitian influx, 11 News reported .\nA dysfunctional country like Haiti could not successfully invade the United States without help from traitors:\nUnder current law, the majority of Haitians being released into the U.S. are inadmissible but have been ordered to be released by the Biden-Harris administration and given “notice to appear” documents for an immigration court hearing years into the future.\nBy the time their hearing comes up, they will have long since been amnestied.\nOn a tip from ABC of the ANC.",

    "text": "【看中国2025年4月3日讯】(看中国记者谢心宇编译报导)马里兰大学巴尔的摩郡分校（UMBC）的一名大二学生说，他只需用脚踢足球，就想出了一种制造更好电池的方法。\n来自哥伦比亚的萨缪尔·本德克（Samuel Bendek）说，他在16岁时在一间足球制造公司工作时，得到了这个灵感。他当时正弹着一个足球，打算研究它如何回收来自天然橡胶制成的足球的动能，然后他发现了如何将这些能量应用于电池中。\n本德克说：“我们的做法是，每四、五年，你只需要更换橡皮筋。这大约是总初始成本的不到20％。你只需要更换橡皮筋，电池就能再用四年，就像新的一样。”\n他的电池比锂离子电池更不易燃，而且不需要提取会留下废物的矿物或其它元素。相反，本德克说，这就像是从树中提取枫糖浆。他说：“树汁从树中提取，对树木没有任何伤害。这是一个非常相似的过程。你不需要砍树，也不会对它们造成任何伤害。”\n现在21岁的本德克是名为Elastic Energy的公司的首席执行官，该公司利用橡胶树的树汁制作橡皮筋，并将它作为电池的主要燃料来源。这款电池重约200磅，大小像一个大号行李箱。他说：“当电池充电时，我们会将橡皮筋拉长到原来长度的八到九倍。我们在充电时利用马达将其拉长，当你需要能量时，我们只需进行反向过程。橡皮筋在恢复过程中移动发电机，将弹性潜能转换为电能。”\n他预见这些电池将用作医院、数据中心等无法承受停电的建筑物的备用电源，同时可能寻求更具价格竞争力的方案。\n本德克说：“其它电池的初始价格非常高，并且它们的使用寿命不长，只有六到八年。你必须在电池耗尽后将其丢弃。”\n他的设计初期成本较低，未来还能节省更多。尽管本德克的公司已有投资者，但尚未准备好进入市场。目前的目标是与能源部提供的研发资金计划合作，进一步开发这个产品，并最终在2027年准备好进入大规模市场。\n来源:【看中国讯】\n短网址: 版权所有，任何形式转载需本站授权许可。 严禁建立镜像网站.\n【诚征荣誉会员】溪流能够汇成大海，小善可以成就大爱。我们向全球华人诚意征集万名\n荣誉会员：每位\n荣誉会员每年只需支付一份订阅费用，成为《看中国》网站的\n荣誉会员，就可以助力我们突破审查与封锁，向至少10000位中国大陆同胞奉上独立真实的关键资讯，在危难时刻向他们发出预警，救他们于大瘟疫与其它社会危难之中。",

    "title": "The Mommyheads to Release New Record 'One Eyed Band'",
    "text": "The album will be released on November 9th. The Mommyheads will release their new album, One Eyed Band, on November 9th, 2024, after delving deep into concept record territory with last year’s Coney Island Kid. They return again to pushing boundaries while not seeming the least bit concerned about any genre or classification and still sounding like they’re enjoying themselves. Releasing seven LPs in the last six years has only fueled their commitment to originality in an ever-changing landscape: well-crafted songs, progressive arrangements, and deft musicianship keep their sound fresh after 37 years together. Complexity mixed with simplicity like chocolate mixed with sea salt is the strength of One Eyed Band. The influences are strong but never cluster originality or sentiment. “Chicken Soup” opens the album with a swirling barrage of 12-string guitars and synths setting the stage for a bittersweet yet rebellious undertone found in all those late 70s, early 80s dusty record collections. Adam starts off by singing the mantra: “Breathing , Searching, Failing, Dreaming,\" leaving us wondering what Genesis would have done if they had made Duke: Part Two? Meanwhile, “Life is a Dream” kicks the door in with a passionately dissonant attack of guitars, disco-inspired horns, and string arrangements that would keep any Elvis Costello or ABBA fan humming along. One Eyed Band draws us in through fearless sonic exploration and intimate storytelling prevalent from the first guitar note of “Season of Our Sound” until the last strum of “Human Being.” Side two continues the journey, starting with the reggae-influenced “Risk It All” which musically begs the question: \"Has anyone ever played a reggae groove in 7/8?\" The song was inspired by the recent events of Russian political prisoner Alexei Navalny. Adam's plaintive lyrics: “They want to silence you ’Cause they see that many can be changed by one” now seem more current than ever. “The Gift” could be at home on a modern version of the Who’s “Tommy” soundtrack. Over-the-top horns and synths shift back and forth between serene acoustic verses as the band powers through to the final uncompromising note. One Eyed Band defines the band’s continued quest for originality that ebbs and flows like a river making its way through our cultural landscape. You never know where the journey will take you yet you’re keenly aware that the voyage is as fruitful and as fun as ever. At this point in their career, The Mommyheads don’t feel the need to musically placate or compromise and we are the beneficiaries. The band also recently found their 1989 debut record original master tapes Acorn in a Rockville, MD attic. They decided to give them a proper remaster for a re-release on January 27, 2025, via the Mommyheads Music Label. They’ve added the bonus track, “At The Mall” from the original Simple Machines 1990 Series to round out the offering. Now is a perfect time to compare and contrast the last 35 years for this enduring band.

    "title": "Water Main Break Causes Lane Closure, Hours-Long Shut-Off in Hillsborough",
    "text": "A faulty valve on a water main led to several Hillsborough residents’ water being shut off on Thursday and a system pressure advisory being put into place.\nA release from the town government first alerted people to a water main break shortly after 10 a.m., saying one lane of Orange Grove Road was closed as utility crews sought to make repairs. The break was fixed by mid-afternoon, but led to a service shut-off for residents along part of Orange Grove Road, and all of Timbers Drive and Binford Street. The area includes the Heritage Apartments complex, Patriots Pointe Apartments neighborhood, Terra Bella Senior Living, Bentley Woods Apartments and residences on Virginia Cates Road.\nFollowing crews’ repair of the water main, the local government said the workers will flush water lines to remove any possible sediment from the break. Water samples will be taken for bacteriological testing, which will take around 24 hours to complete. Hillsborough said any affected properties will be under a system pressure advisory until those test results determine whether the water is safe to drink.\nA system pressure advisory is when a loss of pressure in water lines could cause contamination, but the change in quality has not yet been confirmed. The Town of Hillsborough recommends affected residents to boil water or use bottled water for any consumption until the test results come back and the advisory is lifted. Properties and residents that did not lose water service on Thursday are not affected by the advisory.\nThe full release from the town government can be found\non Hillsborough’s website.\nPhoto via the Town of Hillsborough.\nChapelboro.com does not charge subscription fees, and you can directly support our efforts in local journalism here.
