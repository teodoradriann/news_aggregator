    "text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Mumbai is likely to receive heavy rainfall at isolated places for three days starting Friday. Heavy rainfall is also possible in isolated areas in Thane for the next 24 hours starting 1pm on Friday. Raigad and Pune are likely to receive extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places on Friday. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature is likely to be 30 degrees Celsius and the minimum at 25 degrees Celsius. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in its Mumbai weather update, stated that a high tide of height 3.49 meters is expected to hit the citys coast at 10.51 pm while a low tide of height of 1.89 meters will hit Mumbais coast at 5.10 pm. The civic agency further stated that the island city, in the 24-hour duration that ended at 8 am on Friday, received 10.83 mm of rainfall while the eastern and western suburbs received 17.22 mm and 8.62 mm of rainfall, respectively. Meanwhile, at least five people have been evacuated while two are still missing after a tractor overturned while crossing the Krishna River in Ichalkaranji, on Friday, officials said. According to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), there were seven people onboard the tractor in Akiwat at Shirol taluka in Kolhapur. Soon after getting the information, the NDRF team stationed at Shirol moved to the location to conduct a search and rescue operation. The local authorities have already reached the spot, NDRF said and a search operation is underway to trace the two missing people, ANI reported. Further details are awaited. Several regions in Maharashtra are currently facing continuous heavy rainfall, leading to severe waterlogging and extensive traffic snarls in many cities. Meanwhile, Delhi witnessed light showers on Friday. According to IMD, the national capital is likely to receive sporadic showers through August 5. Rains have brought much relief from the humid weather to those living in the National Capital Region (NCR). However, it led to traffic gridlock and other rain-related problems, stated a PTI report. According to the report, IMD has previously warned that the rains could result in slick roads, reduced visibility, traffic interruptions, and localised waterlogging in low-lying areas. As per airport sources, 10 flights were diverted due to severe weather in Delhi. (With ANI and PTI inputs)",

[PTI](/pti-stories)| Kathmandu | Updated: 20-01-2024 20:53 IST | Created: 20-01-2024 20:53 IST - Country: - Nepal A top Indian Army official on a visit to Nepal has recalled the invaluable sacrifices of gallant Gorkha veterans and assured of the continued meaningful welfare activities for them in the Himalayan nation. India has traditionally had Nepalese, especially the valiant Gorkhas, as soldiers in her Defence Forces from during the British rule. Post-independence, the Nepal government continues to maintain the Gorkha connection with the Indian Army following the Tripartite Agreement signed between the representatives of the governments of UK, India and Nepal on November 9, 1947. Lt Gen AK Singh, GOC-in-C Southern Command and President, Gorkha Brigade, Indian Army, who embarked on his Nepal visit Friday, discussed \"furtherance in military bilateral relations\" between India and Nepal along with bolstering army to army connect with Gen Prabhu Ram Sharma, COAS, Nepal. \"Lt Gen AK Singh, AVSM, YSM, SM, VSM, GOC-in-C Southern Command & President Gorkha Brigade, IA called on Gen Prabhu Ram Sharma, COAS, @NepaliArmyHQ to discuss furtherance in military bilateral relations of India-Nepal & bolstering Army to Army connect,\" the Indian High Commission in Nepal posted on X along with photos from the meeting. On Saturday, the second day of his visit, Lt Gen Singh visited revered MuktiNath Temple, about 375 kms northwest of Kathmandu, and paid obeisance at the 'Bipin Bell' installed on February 18 last year in memory of late Gen Bipin Rawat, former COAS of the Indian Army by four former Indian COAS and honorary generals of Nepali Army. Later, Lt Gen Singh visited the Welfare & Military Pension Branch, a Polyclinic in Defence Wing at Kathmandu and appreciated the initiatives undertaken for veterans' welfare. He also inaugurated a newly built portion of the Bhartiya Gorkha Sainik Niwas, the Southern Command said. Earlier on Friday, the top Army official addressed 3,000 Gorkha Veterans, Veer Naris, widows & dependants at a rally in Pokhara. He also highlighted key welfare issues and honoured Veer Naaris & Gallantry Awardees. At the Pokhra rally, \"the General recalled the invaluable sacrifices of our gallant Gorkha veterans and affirmed the continued commitment of IA & GoI for their meaningful welfare,\" said another post from the Indian High Commission. At the beginning of his Nepal visit, Lt Gen Singh visited the Embassy of India and interacted with the Indian Ambassador Naveen Srivastava. As per the Indian Embassy's data, there are over 1.22 Lakh pensioners (of Indian Army) residing in Nepal as on date. \"The Government of India has made every effort to ensure that these pensioners, their families and dependents are looked after in the best possible manner,\" it said.",
