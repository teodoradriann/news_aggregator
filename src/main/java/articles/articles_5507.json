    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. Video above: Large Santa Cruz waves toss kids The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, sister station [KSBW](https://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-flooding-and-evacuations/46243230) reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Diante da maior cheia dos últimos anos no estado do Amazonas, o Governo Federal intensificou sua atuação emergencial para apoiar a população afetada. Já são 40 municípios em situação de emergência reconhecida, 18 em estado de alerta e 4 em situação de normalidade, conforme boletim do Comitê Permanente de Enfrentamento a Eventos Climáticos e Ambientais. O número de pessoas impactadas chega a mais de 530 mil, com cerca de 133 mil famílias diretamente atingidas pelas inundações que vêm assolando a região desde março.\nO Ministério da Integração e do Desenvolvimento Regional (MIDR), por meio da Secretaria Nacional de Proteção e Defesa Civil (Sedec), já autorizou R$ 17 milhões em repasses federais para ações de assistência humanitária. Os recursos são voltados à compra e distribuição de itens essenciais como alimentos, água potável, colchões, kits de higiene e combustível para transporte de equipes e mantimentos.\n“Os recursos da Defesa Civil podem ser empregados naquele primeiro momento que acontece o desastre para fazer assistência humanitária, bem como para o restabelecimento dos serviços essenciais. Também podemos utilizá-los para reconstruir infraestruturas públicas destruídas”, explicou o ministro Waldez Góes.\nGoverno atua em múltiplas frentes\nA atuação do MIDR se dá em coordenação com os governos estadual e municipal, buscando garantir resposta rápida e articulada. Até agora, 26 planos de trabalho emergencial de municípios foram aprovados e outros três estão em análise — dois para assistência e um para reconstrução.\nAlém da ajuda imediata, o governo já iniciou capacitações para agentes locais e prepara o lançamento, ainda no segundo semestre, da ferramenta Defesa Civil Alerta, que vai fortalecer o monitoramento e resposta a desastres em toda a região Norte.\nEm Manaus, o nível do Rio Negro ultrapassou os 28,90 metros, chegando perto da cota de inundação severa. A estabilidade nos últimos dias indica aproximação da vazante, segundo o Serviço Geológico do Brasil (SGB). Ainda assim, cidades como Manacapuru, Itacoatiara e Humaitá enfrentam níveis alarmantes nos rios Solimões, Amazonas e Madeira.\nCausas da cheia prolongada\nDe acordo com a geóloga Jussara Cury, do SGB, a cheia persistente é explicada pelo acúmulo de chuvas na parte norte da bacia amazônica, somado ao represamento natural do Rio Solimões. “Esse represamento impede o escoamento do Rio Negro, mantendo os níveis elevados por mais tempo, inclusive em Manaus”, explicou.\nApesar de as chuvas em julho parecerem atípicas, elas já estavam previstas em boletins climáticos, causadas por correntes de umidade do Atlântico.\nAções locais complementam resposta federal\nNo interior, a cheia já comprometeu o funcionamento de escolas em diversos municípios. Em Anamã, Itacoatiara, Novo Aripuanã e Uarini, 444 alunos seguem com aulas remotas por meio do programa Aula em Casa. A Secretaria de Educação do estado ainda não divulgou o número total de escolas afetadas.\nEm Manaus, ações emergenciais incluem:\nConstrução de mais de 800 metros de pontes provisórias; Entrega programada de cestas básicas, água e kits de higiene; Monitoramento de áreas rurais e urbanas; Implantação de um plano habitacional de 15 mil moradias, parte delas para famílias em áreas de risco. A Secretaria Municipal de Limpeza Urbana (Semulsp) já recolheu mais de 2.500 toneladas de lixo e bloqueou 1.359 toneladas com ecobarreiras, evitando o agravamento da poluição dos igarapés e do Rio Negro. Governo do Amazonas também reforça ajuda\nO governo estadual já enviou:\n580 toneladas de cestas básicas; 2.450 caixas d’água de 500 litros; 57 mil copos de água potável; 10 kits purificadores do programa Água Boa; 1 estação de tratamento móvel (Etam). Municípios como Humaitá, Manicoré, Borba e Boca do Acre estão entre os mais atingidos e recebem atenção especial nas ações de distribuição.\nDefesa Civil mantém alerta\nA Defesa Civil Estadual segue monitorando os níveis dos rios em tempo real. A população pode acionar o órgão pelo telefone 199 ou pelo número alternativo (92) 98802-3547. O Sistema Integrado de Informações sobre Desastres (S2iD) continua recebendo novos planos de trabalho dos municípios afetados.\nCompromisso com vidas e reconstrução\nA resposta coordenada do Governo Federal reafirma o compromisso com a proteção da vida, o socorro às populações vulneráveis e a reconstrução de áreas afetadas. A crise climática na Amazônia revela a urgência de ações estruturantes que combinem prevenção, adaptação e combate à desigualdade socioambiental.\n“Vamos seguir atuando com celeridade e responsabilidade. O povo do Amazonas pode contar com o apoio do governo do presidente Lula para superar esse momento difícil com dignidade e segurança”, concluiu o ministro Waldez Góes.",

    "text": "French Priest And Holocaust Expert Counters Attempts To Exploit Jesus For Anti-Israel Agenda By [CNA](https://www.eurasiareview.com/author/cna/) By Peter Pinedo A French priest and Holocaust expert criticized Israel’s detractors, especially viral social media claims that Jesus would be a Palestinian targeted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) if he were alive today. Father Patrick Desbois, a renowned Holocaust researcher honored for his work identifying the mass graves of Jews killed by Nazis in Eastern Europe, decried recent attempts to claim Jesus as a Palestinian to further an anti-Israel agenda. In an interview this week, he said: “If he had been born today, Jesus would be a target of missiles or a hostage in Gaza,” referring to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israeli civilians. He made his comments in an interview with the French-language channel of [i24 News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWoZy-w0SCg&t=3s) published Tuesday that was covered by the Jewish Middle East news source [The Algemeiner](https://www.algemeiner.com/2023/12/26/jesus-would-be-hostage-gaza-if-alive-today-says-french-catholic-priest-who-pioneered-holocaust-research/). Priest takes on social media Desbois took aim at a claim that circulated on social media that Jesus was Palestinian and not Jewish. “What we see in Bethlehem today, this need to affirm that Jesus was not Jewish, is political,” he argued. Syrian-British influencer Richard Medhurst, for one, asserted in a Christmas Eve video that “you cannot be a Christian and support Israel.” “If Jesus were born today, he would be born under the rubble, he would be persecuted in his mother’s womb like so many Palestinians who have died stillborn because of Israeli bombardment,” Medhurst shared. Desbois countered: “If he had lived in 1942, Jesus would have been deported to Auschwitz, and if he had been born today, he would be the target of missiles or be a hostage in Gaza.” A researcher of the Nazi mass murder of Jews in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, Desbois also suggested that much of the criticism of Israel comes from hatred toward the Jewish people. “I always say: If there were no Jews in Israel, few people would look out for the Palestinians,” he said. Desbois said in a 2018 interview, The Algemeiner reported, that Hamas terrorists and those arguing for the end of the state of Israel are motivated by the same antisemitic sentiments as the Nazis. “The Nazis wanted to eliminate every last Jew, even the babies and the old people,” he told The Algemeiner in 2018. “[Now,] they say to the Jews, ‘get out of France,’ ‘get out of Germany,’ ‘get out of Britain,’ ‘get out of Palestine.’ And at the end, who will stay?”",

    "title": "How This Denver Baker Got On Netflix’s Is It Cake?",
    "text": "The Local newsletter is your free, daily guide to life in Colorado. For locals, by locals. Sign up today! Grace “Grey” Pak hasn’t always been a baker, but she has always had a penchant for art. After majoring in fine art at New York University, she worked as a web designer for a decade and started a wedding stationery business on the side. After a nearly two-year-long stint doing e-commerce for New York’s [Museum of Modern Art](https://www.moma.org), Pak was inspired to expand her studies. Her interest in artists’ minds and how their brains process information led her to pursue a master’s degree in neuroscience at Columbia University. But shortly after earning her degree, personal loss forced her to reassess her life path. “I was having a lot of fun in the neuroscience field and doing research, but one week I lost a few people in my life I was close with, which was just a complete pause moment,” Pak says. “I know people say, ‘If you were to die tomorrow, what would you do?,’ but [those events] put me in an existential crisis.” After some soul searching, Pak decided to turn her shared love for food and art into a career by baking cakes for a living—an aspiration complicated by the fact that she had no professional experience baking. “I signed up for culinary school that week,” Pak says. “At the time, everyone thought it was just a phase or a coping mechanism, but I stuck to it.” Pak started culinary school in 2016 and eventually folded her cake design into the wedding stationery business, [Duchess of Cameron](https://www.duchessofcameron.com/index.html). Later that year, Pak decided to make baking the sole focus of Duchess of Cameron. Around the same time, she and her husband began splitting their time between New York and Denver. That’s why Duchess of Cameron doesn’t have a storefront: Pak fulfills her orders through the use of commercial kitchens in both cities. Regardless of where she makes them, her custom cakes, usually made for weddings or corporate events, are intricate. They often incorporating floral motifs or hand-painted designs that resemble fine china—work so impressive that it grabbed the attention of Netflix producers, who were casting the third season of their hit show [Is It Cake?](https://www.netflix.com/title/81333845). The premise of Is It Cake? is simple: Over the course of eight episodes, cake designers are challenged to bake sweet replicas of everyday objects (think: pool floaties or a club sandwich on a plate) in aims of producing the most hyperrealistic creation. This season, Pak went up against seven other bakers in hopes to win the grand prize of $100,000. Celebrity judges are involved, too: Stars like Oscar Nuñez, Storm Reid, and Ego Nwodim try to guess which items are real or cake, and every episode, the contestant who doesn’t fool the judges is eliminated. The show requires attention to detail, which Pak had previously perfected with her signature cake design, but the competition also forced her to learn new skills. “When making hyperrealistic cakes, I’m really focusing on the 3D shape and sculpting,” Pak says. “If I’m making a shoe, it needs to look like a shoe, and I don’t need to pay too much attention to the tiny details. With the painted cakes, the tiny details are all I focus on, so the priorities are different.” Plus, contestants on the show have to make their cakes in eight hours, something Pak says added to the stress of competing. “The set is huge and I’m short, so it was a commute to get to the other side of the set but the clock is always ticking,” Pak says. While we won’t spoil the outcome of the show—tune in to season 3 of the show, which debuted in late March to find out if Pak wins the grand prize—Pak is still baking her detailed creations in both New York City and Denver. She and her husband spend winter and summer here in Colorado and spring and fall in New York, something Pak says aligns with the wedding seasons in each state. Through her baking, Pak also works closely with art therapists and nonprofits. She has collaborated with [Womankind](https://www.iamwomankind.org), a New York–based organization that works with survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, by leading participants in cupcake decorating sessions. “One woman decorated her cupcakes with butterflies and shared how it signifies her freedom now,” Pak says. “It was so beautiful yet simple. It’s always so empowering for people to have something they can create after feeling like they had no control in their lives.” In Colorado, Pak has recently connected with the City of Denver to bring cake therapy to the local migrant and unhoused populations. “There’s just not enough mental health support for these groups, and art therapy works regardless of any language barriers,” Pak says. While she doesn’t have any concrete plans yet, she hopes to start working with the city at some point this year. Since the show’s filming, Pak has started incorporating more sculptural, 3D elements into her cake design. While it’s not clear yet if her appearance on the show will draw more customers to her business, Pak remains busy as ever. She’ll be spending the next few weeks baking in New York before returning to Colorado this summer. “Things are always crazy, but this is what I love doing,” she says.",

    "text": "Sister Wives star Janelle Brown shared an update about her 156-acre Taeda Farm, which has become her passion project after she moved to North Carolina.\n“Clearing the Way for Taeda Farm. In our small town, word of mouth is gold — and that’s how we found Earl Brock, with Brock’s lot development,” the company, which is run by Janelle, 55, and her daughter Maddie Brush (née Brown), wrote via its Instagram account alongside clips that showed off the land. “He is the skid steer whisperer and a storyteller extraordinaire. Imagine Barry Corbin with a Southern drawl, a tractor and enough stories to keep you entertained for days.”\nThe duo continued to praise the work Earl had done in the caption, as the video showed him clearing paths on the property. “Earl rolled onto our land with a big grin and left us with clear space for a garden, chicken coop and our future home. (Not to mention some very happy kids who think watching trees turn to mulch is the greatest show on Earth),” they continued.\n“He didn’t just clear the land—he gave us an afternoon of laughter, knowledge and the kind of community connection that makes small-town life so special,” the caption concluded. “Here’s to Earl, his skid steer, and the first big step in building our dream on Taeda Farm — one mulched tree at a time.”\nSister Wives' Janelle and Madison Brown Announce New Flower Business Shortly after the post was shared, several fans took to the comments section to congratulate Janelle and Maddie, 29, on breaking ground on the business.\n“How exciting! Congrats! I hope you find a way to balance the farm and production with the natural area, wildlife and environment we’ve been blessed with. It’s always a juggling act, but you can do it!” one person commented. Another added, “Oh wow! So excited for you and your family! Maybe get a few goats.”\nSister Wives' Janelle Brown Wants to Sell Coyote Pass Land After Kody Split Janelle, Maddie and Maddie’s husband, Caleb Brush , first announced that they founded the company in September 2024. Taeda Farms is a “flower farm in the works” and is considered “halfway homesteading,” according to the company’s Instagram bio.\nShe revealed her latest career venture nearly two years after she announced her split from ex-husband Kody Brown in December 2022. The former couple share six kids, including Maddie and their late son, Robert Garrison Brown, who passed away at the age of 25 in March 2024.\nFollowing their split, Janelle stayed in Flagstaff, Arizona. However, In Touch exclusively revealed that she purchased a property in Chocowinity, North Carolina , for $289,000 in March 2024, and it was listed as agricultural for the company Taeda Farms, LLC.\nThe town is located less than 30 minutes away from where Maddie and Caleb, 37, live with their three kids. Not only did the move allow Janelle to spend more time with Maddie and her grandchildren, but she will also be nearby when Maddie gives birth to baby No. 4.\nCrosswords Celebrity Crossword 126 Play now Janelle has clearly invested a lot of time and energy into Taeda Farms, and she previously shared an update about her living arrangements in a December 2024 social media post.\n“Not West Virginia but my new home,” she wrote alongside a video – which was set to John Denver’s song “Take Me Home, Country Roads” – that captured trees and unpaved roads on a vacant plot of land.",
