    "text": "India to maintain growth velocity in 2024: Assocham “India’s macro picture looks convincing with the economy following a trend growth of seven per cent with critical building blocks combining to give it brighter prospects,’ Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said. NEW DELHI: India is likely to remain the fastest-growing major economy in the world in 2024 on the back of strong consumer demand leading to a pick up in investment across sectors such as construction, hospitality and infrastructure including railways and aviation, Assocham said on Thursday. India retained the tag of the world’s fastest-growing major economy, with its GDP expanding by a faster-than-expected rate of 7.6 per cent in the July-September quarter on booster shots from government spending and manufacturing. The country’s Gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.6 per cent beat most estimates, including 6.5 per cent projected by the RBI. The growth compares to 6.2 per cent in the same quarter last year and 7.8 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter, official data showed. India’s GDP growth beat China’s 4.9 per cent rise in July-Sept, while the Western economies are getting crushed under high-interest rates and energy prices. “India’s macro picture looks convincing with the economy following a trend growth of seven per cent with critical building blocks combining to give it brighter prospects,’ Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said. According to the industry body, India Inc led by financials, construction, hotels, aviation, automobile and other manufacturing areas like electronics are on a strong pitch to further improve performance in the coming year.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD: Religious scholars and leaders representing various schools of thought, along with the Pakistan Ulema Council, on Friday observed the ‘Children’s Protection Day’ across the country. On this significant occasion, they used their Friday sermons to urge the public to fearlessly ensure their children receive the polio vaccine, thereby safeguarding them from potential lifelong disabilities. Ulema and Mashaykh said it was imperative to emphasise that the administration of polio drops was entirely lawful and these drops had no adverse impact on human structure and did not induce weakness in children. They said, “Islamic Shariah directives also advocate avoiding risks to oneself and one’s children. Thus, it becomes a parental responsibility to administer polio drops, and those who neglect this duty may unfortunately, subject their children to the consequences of polio. Such negligence would be viewed unfavorably by Allah and the society.” The religious scholars unanimously asserted that the opposition or resistance to polio vaccination in Pakistan was rooted in ignorance. “Those who spread propaganda against this vital campaign were, in essence, jeopardising the health of children,” they added. They said historically, polio was prevalent in different parts of the world, including America, Great Britain, European countries, and India. “However, these nations dedicated relentless efforts to control and eventually eliminate the disease. Today, they stand free from its grip. Regrettably, Pakistan still grapples with polio,” they maintained. They said the international health organisations were diligently working to eradicate the disease by administering vaccinations to children, adding that they actively supported these initiatives. Despite these efforts, they said certain elements, driven by ignorance or ulterior motives, continued to obstruct the progress in combating polio. The religious scholars emphasised that vaccines were a form of medicine, and the teachings of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) regarding the use of medicine were unequivocal. They said polio was an ailment for which there was no cure once contracted. Quoting Allah’s guidance in the Holy Quran against self-harm, they highlighted the moral imperative of not allowing a child to suffer a lifelong disability by withholding necessary medication. They further asserted that “the choice lied between nurturing a nation of sound mental and physical health or one burdened with mental and physical handicaps. “Those impeding children from receiving polio vaccinations should reflect on this consequential decision.” The religious scholars who expressed these views included Pakistan Ulema Council Chairman Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi, Allama Ziaullah Shah Bukhari, Pir Naqibur Rahman, Pir Hasan Hasibur Rahman, Maulana Muhammad Khan Leghari, Allama Arif Wahidi, Allama Abdul Haq Mujahid and others.",

    "text": "Seattle | Microsoft said it would eliminate 1900 roles in its video game division, including at Activision Blizzard, which it acquired for $US69 billion ($105 billion) three months ago.\nThe job cuts will be made at Activision Blizzard, the maker of hit games such as Call of Duty and Guitar Hero , as well as at Xbox, according to a staff memo from Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft Gaming, that was obtained by The New York Times .\nAt Microsoft, gaming has become the company’s most important consumer business.\nThe cuts amount to a reduction of nearly 9 per cent of Microsoft’s 22,000-person video game division, but less than 1 per cent of the company’s roughly 220,000 employees overall.\n“Looking ahead, we’ll continue to invest in areas that will grow our business and support our strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world,” Mr Spencer said in the memo.\nThis month, thousands of employees across the video game industry have been told they are facing layoffs, as the pandemic boom in playing continues to recede.\nAdvertisement Riot Games, which makes League of Legends , said it would lay off about 11 per cent of its workforce. Twitch, a video streaming platform owned by Amazon that is used heavily by gamers, announced that it would cut 35 per cent of its staff. Discord, a social platform beloved by gamers, is cutting 18 per cent of its ranks. And Unity Software, which provides software for game developers, said it was cutting one-quarter of its staff, or roughly 1800 jobs. They all had layoffs last year as well.\n‘Unprecedented’ turn Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming researcher at the analytics firm Ampere Analysis, said some trims at Activision Blizzard were expected after the acquisition, but the extent of the industry cuts was “unprecedented.”\n“I’ve been really surprised by the scale and extent in terms of the number of companies that have laid people off in the new year,” he said. “It seems like a lot of companies waited for the end of the year and pulled the trigger in January.”\nAt Microsoft, gaming has become the company’s most important consumer business, surpassing $US15 billion in annual sales, largely under the Xbox brand. The company’s ambitions became clear two years ago, when it announced the blockbuster deal to acquire Activision Blizzard, whose valuation had fallen over concerns about its workplace culture, which the company denied.\nThe deal faced intense regulatory scrutiny around the world, and the company had to delay the closing date to October, from August.\nAdvertisement In the meantime, as the world reopened after the pandemic retreated, consumers started going out again instead of staying in and playing. Microsoft’s gaming revenue fell $US764 million, or 5 per cent, in its last fiscal year, which ended June 30.\nBobby Kotick, who led Activision Blizzard since 2008 and built it into a powerhouse, left the company at the end of last year. The president of Blizzard Entertainment, Mike Ybarra, announced on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that Thursday would be his last day at the company.\n“Having already spent 20+ years at Microsoft and with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard behind us, it’s time for me to (once again) become Blizzard’s biggest fan from the outside,” Mr Ybarra wrote.\nThe layoffs were reported earlier by The Verge . Microsoft declined to comment.\nThe video game industry is “suffering through a winter right now”, said Joost van Dreunen, a New York University professor who studies the gaming business.\nThis year is expected to be slower for the industry than 2023, which had a series of blockbuster releases including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and a remake of Resident Evil 4 .\nAdvertisement In the meantime, companies are shedding workers and cutting costs to stay competitive. “If everybody around you is cutting their overhead and you don’t, you’re going to invoke the wrath of your shareholders at some point,” Mr van Dreunen said.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times .\nSave Log in or Subscribe to save article\nShare Introducing your Newsfeed\nFollow the topics, people and companies that matter to you.\nFind out more\nRead More Video games\nMicrosoft\nJobs\nSponsored Advertisement Latest In Technology Fetching latest articles\nMost Viewed In Technology",

    "title": "Russia-Ukraine War: What is ‘Oreshnik’ missile and its impact on global defence?",
    "text": "In a significant escalation of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had deployed its newest hypersonic medium-range ballistic missile, the “Oreshnik” (Hazel Tree), targeting a Ukrainian defence facility. The missile strike came in response to Ukraine’s use of US and British-supplied weaponry against Russian targets, signalling heightened tensions with global implications, reports Reuters.\nWhat is the “Oreshnik”? The “Oreshnik” missile represents a new era of Russian hypersonic weaponry. Capable of travelling at speeds ten times faster than sound, it is designed to be nearly impossible to intercept. With a reported range of 5,000 kilometres (3,100 miles), the missile can strike targets across Europe and even reach the west coast of the United States.\nEquipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs), the “Oreshnik” can carry six to eight warheads, conventional or nuclear, hitting multiple targets simultaneously. Russian military experts suggest the missile, likely based on the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), is already in active service.\nWhat Did Putin Say? In a stark warning, Putin declared that the Ukraine war is inching toward a global conflict. He justified the missile strike as retaliation for Ukraine’s use of Western-supplied missiles, which he claimed had been used to target deeper into Russian territory.\nOn November 21, the “Oreshnik” was launched at Pivdenmash (Yuzhmash), a missile and space rocket manufacturing hub in Dnipro, Ukraine. Putin emphasised that such actions were necessary to protect Russia’s interests, hinting at potential future strikes if Western nations continue arming Ukraine.\nWhat Does Ukraine Say? Ukraine’s response was swift and unequivocal. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy labelled the missile attack a “clear and severe escalation,” urging the global community to condemn Russia’s actions.\nUkraine’s air force initially claimed that an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had been used, but this was refuted by US intelligence. ICBMs are defined by their range of over 5,500 kilometres (3,400 miles), while the “Oreshnik” falls under the intermediate-range category.\nThe RS-26 and Hypersonic Evolution\nThe “Oreshnik” is believed to share its design lineage with the RS-26 Rubezh, a solid-fuel, road-mobile missile developed in 2008. This missile system became a point of contention between the United States and Russia, particularly after the U.S. exited the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019. The treaty had previously banned the development of such weapons, citing their destabilizing potential.\nThe RS-26 program exemplifies how Russia has prioritized hypersonic advancements, aiming to outpace Western missile defences. The withdrawal from the INF Treaty has further emboldened Moscow’s development of intermediate-range systems like the “Oreshnik.”\nEconomic and Geopolitical implications The deployment of the “Oreshnik” underscores the financial and strategic investments Russia is channelling into its military. Hypersonic missile technology is costly, with individual missiles potentially exceeding $20 million in production costs. Sustaining such advancements amid Western sanctions adds further strain to Russia’s economy.\nFor Ukraine, the attack on Pivdenmash signifies not only a military setback but also a blow to its industrial infrastructure, complicating post-war recovery efforts. The strike raises concerns about the vulnerability of critical economic assets in wartime.\nGlobal defence budgets are also under pressure. Western nations, particularly the United States and NATO allies, may need to accelerate investments in missile defence systems to counter hypersonic threats. Such developments could trigger an arms race, with economic ripple effects on both military and civilian sectors worldwide.\nWhat’s Next? As tensions escalate, the “Oreshnik” could become a symbol of the broader technological and strategic shifts in modern warfare. For Russia, it represents a show of strength. For Ukraine and its allies, it underscores the urgent need for robust defence strategies and sustained international support.\nThe use of hypersonic missiles in the conflict signals a dangerous turn, with potential implications for global security and economic stability. As the situation unfolds, the world will closely watch how nations navigate this precarious moment in history.",
