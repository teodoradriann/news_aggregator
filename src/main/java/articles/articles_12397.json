    "text": "A mum-of-two is one step closer to being Australia's first female astronaut. [Australian Space Agency](/story/8449301/) employee Katherine Bennell-Pegg announced she was halfway through her year-long training at the European Astronaut Centre in Germany. While other Australian women have trained to go to space, they've always done so under the flags of other countries. Ms Bennell-Beg and her family relocated to Europe for the intensive training process. More than 22,000 people applied to the coveted position in hopes of becoming an astronaut candidate. The job requires rigorous physical training, as well as a year of intensive study. \"I have always dreamed of being an astronaut,\" she said. \"When I was young, it was for the adventure but after more than a decade working in space it's now because I know the role it plays in tackling real-world problems.\" The next six months are expected to include intense exercise, sea survival, studying space station robotic arm simulations and centrifuge training. \"We need to know the basics around medical procedures - not just in case something goes wrong, but because astronauts are basically medical guinea pigs,\" she told the [ Australian Space Agency](/story/8338233/). \"In space, as your body adapts to weightlessness any medical issues you may have on Earth - such as osteoporosis, or muscle degradation - are put on fast forward and we can support research on that.\" The Adelaide-born astronaut candidate previously served as Director of Space Technology at the Australian Space Agency, and as part of the space robotics and automation team. In early December, Ms Bennell-Pegg travelled to the United States where she underwent specialised training with NASA in Houston and met with Australian Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd in Washington DC. \"I'm excited - not just for me - but for what my training and experience can unlock for Australian scientists, engineers and operators, and all the value that can bring,\" she said.

    "text": "By Rudi Keller ,\n1 hour ago Gov. Mike Parson discusses his plans for the coming fiscal year's budget Thursday following groundbreaking for a new multiagency state laboratory in Jefferson City. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)\nHundreds of earmarked items in the $51.7 billion budget passed by lawmakers this year will be vetoed, Gov. Mike Parson said Thursday, just days before the new fiscal year begins.\nSpeaking with reporters after groundbreaking for a new multi-agency state laboratory, Parson had two criticisms for the budget plan — it goes overboard on earmarks and shortchanges essential state services.\nParson said the administration’s budget staff had identified more than 600 earmarked items throughout the 16 appropriation bills for the fiscal year that begins Monday.\n“We’re going to veto a lot of the earmarks, especially some of them that maybe were not even ready to be done, that just people put different things in there,” Parson said. “There’s gonna be a lot of the those making it across the finish line, but not everybody’s gonna get what they want.”\nState budget loaded with earmarks nears deadline for action by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson\nThe Independent analyzed the budget and found more than 400 earmarked items – with 284 new this year – totaling $2.1 billion in spending.\nParson called those earmarks “a lot of overspending.” The state services that are not fully funded will require a large infusion of additional cash, he said, but lawmakers won’t have to return this fall to pass a supplemental budget.\n“You’ll see one of the largest supplementals at the beginning of next year that you’ve seen,” Parson told reporters.\nThe state is sitting on a large surplus, but Parson said it is not as large as the fund balances in the treasury would make it appear. The budget passed by lawmakers spends $15.3 billion in general revenue — including $700 million on earmarked items identified by The Independent.\nWhen they were finished with the budget in May, legislative leaders claimed two achievements – a total $1 billion less than Parson requested in January and ongoing general revenue spending that was less than ongoing revenues.\nIn legislative language, that means that spending above the expected $13.1 billion in general revenue would be one-time expenses met by tapping the surplus.\nWhen the total after his vetoes is added to the amount of the supplemental budget needed to maintain services, he said, that will no longer be true.\n“That was more of a political gesture than it was anything,” Parson said.\nThe House Budget Committee chairman, state Rep. Cody Smith of Carthage, and the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, state Sen. Lincoln Hough of Springfield, are both running for statewide office.\nEven with spending from the surplus, Parson said, the state will have about $1.5 billion in extra cash at the end of the coming fiscal year.\n“I’m gonna make sure,” Parson said, “that there’s enough finances available for the next administration.”\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nThe post Missouri Gov. Mike Parson says he plans to veto hundreds of earmarked spending items appeared first on Missouri Independent .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "FOR DISCHARGE | Rimberto Salvanera receives his commutation papers on Dec. 27, 2023, while still a patient at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute. (Photo from the Bureau of Corrections)\nMANILA, Philippines — One of the country’s oldest prisoners was released after 16 years behind bars on Wednesday, his sentence commuted on humanitarian grounds, according to the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor).\nThe murder convict Rimberto Salvanera, 86, was confined at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute in Quezon City when he received his release order as one of the 1,227 BuCor inmates who were freed this month.\nADVERTISEMENT Salvanera was given a certificate of discharge, a grooming kit and a transportation allowance that should be enough for him to return home, BuCor said in a statement.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO 14-year-old kills older sister in deadly Christmas gift dispute NEWSINFO Police car veering into bus lane causes road crash on Edsa; 5 hurt NEWSINFO LTO suspends license of overcharging taxi driver The prisoner was sent to New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City on March 10, 2012, after being found guilty of the murder of a man in General Trias, Cavite province, on Oct. 23, 1995.\nThe Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 41 sentenced him to reclusion perpetua, which carries a minimum term of 20 years in prison and a maximum term of 40.\nWhy the delay According to BuCor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed an order on Dec. 29, 2022, commuting Salvanera’s sentence to between 20 and 25 years. However, all other terms of his sentence, including civil liabilities, remained in effect.\nAsked why it took a year for the commutation order to be implemented, a BuCor official explained that Salvanera had not fully served his term when it came out, despite the reduction of his sentence and the good conduct time allowance (GCTA) credits he had earned.\n“Based on records, Salvanera has fully served his sentence upon computation of actual time served,” BuCor said.\nThe prisoner’s actual time served was 16 years, seven months, and 22 days, while his GCTA credits earned him nine years, five months, and one day. That amounted to a total of 26 years and 23 days, well past the 25 years of his maximum commuted sentence.\nADVERTISEMENT BuCor chief Director General Gregorio Catapang Jr. said Salvanera was “qualified for release from confinement upon expiration of maximum sentence and there is no other legal grounds for him to be further detained.”\nBased on court records, Salvanera had masterminded the murder of Ruben Parane by hiring Edgardo Lungcay as the gunman and Feliciano Abutin as the driver of the getaway motorcycle.\n‘Political detainee’ Another person linked to the crime, Domingo Tampelix, delivered the money to the hitman.\nAll of the accused were arrested, except Lungcay.\nThe Court of Appeals later allowed the prosecution to drop Abutin and Tampelix as respondents and turn them into state witnesses while upholding Salvanera’s conviction. He elevated the case to the Supreme Court, which denied his appeal in 2007.\nThe BuCor statement described Salvanera as a “political detainee,” but court records did not identify him as a member of any political group, such as the Communist Party of the Philippines or its armed and political wings, as in the case of most of over 800 political prisoners in the country.\nDela Peña case Rights organizations like Kapatid consider another octogenarian, Gerardo dela Peña, to be the country’s oldest political detainee. The group has been clamoring for the release of Dela Peña, 84, citing his advanced age and poor health.\nA farmer who hailed from Camarines Norte, Dela Peña was convicted by a Daet, Camarines Norte, court in February 2014 of murdering his nephew Melchor on April 21, 2001. The case dragged on as Dela Peña was arrested only in March 2013.\nThe prosecution then alleged that Dela Peña and his brother Armenio were members of the New People’s Army and suspected Melchor of being an intelligence asset of the military.\nThe Supreme Court denied Dela Peña’s appeal and affirmed his conviction in November 2019.\nSickly, elderly Earlier this month, the Department of Justice, which supervises BuCor, said nearly 1,000 inmates may be recommended for executive clemency this holiday season.\nAfter his appointment as BuCor chief last year, Catapang urged the president to consider granting clemency to more than 3,000 sickly and elderly inmates over 65 years old to help decongest the seven facilities run by the bureau across the country.\nIn August, a 100-year-old female inmate convicted of drug trafficking was released from the Correctional Institution for Women in Mandaluyong City, the oldest inmate to be released in recent years.\nYour subscription could not be saved.
