    "title": "For the First Time in 130 Years, Mount Fuji Remains Snowless",
    "text": "For the first time since 1894, Mount Fuji , Japan’s highest peak, remains snow-free at its summit as October draws to a close—a stark reminder of the potential impacts of global warming.\nLast year, snow blanketed the mountaintop by October 5, but this year, unusually warm weather has delayed its arrival.\nJapan’s meteorological agency originally expected snow to cover the summit starting on October 2, around the same time as last year’s first snowfall. However, no snow has yet appeared.\nMount Fuji without Snow at the End of October: A Record Statistic\nThe absence of snow on Mount Fuji is an extraordinary phenomenon. Known for its constant snowy peak, the mountain typically has at least some snow cover, though it varies in amount throughout the year. This year, however, it seems unusual for the mountain to be completely snowless.\nRead also: Images Reveal the Devastating Impact of DANA in Spain\nScientists believe one key reason for this anomaly is Japan’s record-breaking summer heat, with temperatures from June to August averaging 1.76 degrees Celsius higher than normal.\nOther possible factors, according to reports from Livedoor News via SoraNews24, include two typhoons that recently swept through eastern Japan, which may have affected weather conditions at the mountain’s high altitude.\nWhile Mount Fuji remains bare, clouds near the summit hint at the potential return of snow as temperatures drop and typhoon activity lessens in the coming months.\nSo… When Will It Snow on Mount Fuji?\nAccording to tenki.jp, a weather forecast website run by the Japan Meteorological Association, rain may fall around Mount Fuji on November 6. «Cold air will move in, changing the rain to snow at the summit,» the site reported.\nIf accurate, this forecast suggests the first snowfall could arrive on the morning of November 7. Another forecast company, Weather News, told AFP that «the first snowfall will likely be delayed until November.»",

    "text": "'A Complete Unknown' (2024) Review: Bob Dylan Biopic Is Pretty Good\nAnother OutKick movie review — Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, ya filthy animals.\n\"A Complete Unknown\" may rank as my favorite movie of the year … that or \"Dune 2.\"\nOn Christmas, the Bob Dylan biopic came out, titled \"A Complete Unknown\" (famous lyrics from one of Dylan's songs, of course).\nDirected by the same cat (James Mangold) who made \"Walk the Line\" and \"Ford V. Ferrari,\" the expectations were high for what felt like a long-awaited biopic of a fabled American musician.\nWell, we finally got it (starring College GameDay's Timothee Chalamet).\nWhat we got was another strong Mangold movie that'll make dads throw a thumb in the air (maybe even two thumbs) and say, \"hell yeah.\"\nAnd since most people like Bob Dylan, I believe most people will enjoy this movie.\nOutKick's Non-Spoilery Bob Dylan Biopic Review — A Complete Unknown (2024)\nFirstly, the film doesn't glorify Bob Dylan as an otherworldly being.\nBob Dylan is human and sometimes an a**hole, but what makes him a different a-hole is his immense talent.\nThe movie's Best Hits include its storytelling, direction, acting, and sound production.\nEvery strum of the guitar is richly heard, and every puff on the harmonica is sweet.\nThe young star in Chalamet keeps the film moving at a good pace with a rousing portrayal of Dylan that never feels like parody.\n\"A Complete Unknown\" features plenty of scenes where the artist(s) perform songs you've definitely heard before, and the magic of the scene makes you gawk at this fabled artist.\nSweetening the movie's narrative were well-known characters like Joan Baez, Pete Seeger and Johnny Cash, all strongly performed by their respective actors.\nEven in 2024, this biopic of a generally beloved musician is never highbrow.\nJames Mangold specializes in these sleek, accessible films about complex characters.\nMangold's task is to make you sympathize with Dylan (an a-hole in the film) through his talent for music, which I think worked for my Christmas Day audience at the local AMC.\n\"A Complete Unknown\" is worth watching. Any movie that inspires you to start wearing sunglasses indoors and talking real nasally has to be decent.\nNine out of 10.\n(Will you watch the Bob Dylan biopic? Why or why not?

    "text": "Struggles in the weight loss journey Coach Kelly Fitness Correspondent Overcoming Challenges and Finding Success Embarking on a weight loss journey can be a daunting task. The path to achieving your health and fitness goals is often filled with challenges that can make you question your commitment. But rest assured, you’re not alone in this struggle. Many individuals encounter similar obstacles along the way. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll delve into the common struggles faced during a weight loss journey, offering valuable insights, practical advice, and inspiring stories to help you overcome these challenges and find success. The Battle with Fatigue and Aches Picture this: you’ve committed to a new workout routine and are determined to stick to it. However, a few weeks in, you find yourself tired, your muscles aching, and the allure of your cozy bed becomes irresistible. This battle with fatigue is a common struggle. Your body is adapting to the increased physical activity, and it’s perfectly normal to feel tired. Listen to your body, and remember that rest is crucial to your fitness journey. Instead of pushing yourself to exhaustion, consider incorporating rest days into your routine to allow your muscles to recover and rebuild. Conquering Cravings and Resisting Temptation Cravings are like a siren’s call, pulling you toward unhealthy food choices. Imagine you’re diligently following a well-balanced diet, but suddenly, a powerful craving for something sweet or salty hits you. You find yourself reaching for a bag of chips or a sugary treat, despite your best intentions. Cravings are a formidable opponent, but there are strategies to conquer them. Stay hydrated, as sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger. Opt for healthier alternatives to satisfy your cravings, such as a piece of dark chocolate or a handful of nuts. The key is finding a balance that satisfies your taste buds while keeping you on track. The Procrastination Pitfall Procrastination is a silent saboteur that can derail your weight loss efforts. You may find yourself delaying workouts or meal prep, rationalising that you’ll start tomorrow. Tomorrow turns into next week, and soon, your goals feel out of reach. Beating procrastination requires planning and commitment. Set specific times for your workouts and meal prep, and stick to them as you would any other important appointment. Having a structured plan helps overcome the temptation to procrastinate and ensures that you stay consistent. Breaking Through Plateaus Hitting a plateau is a common frustration in the weight loss journey. After initial progress, your weight loss may stall, leaving you feeling disheartened. Remember, plateaus are a sign that your body is adjusting to your new routine. To break through this phase, consider altering your workout routine or tweaking your diet for example reducing certain carbohydrates and bad sugar (Please ensure you confirm with a healthcare professional to ensure safe dieting). Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to challenge your body and boost your metabolism. Evaluate your caloric intake to ensure you’re still creating a deficit. Plateaus are a natural part of the process — staying patient and persistent will lead to eventual breakthroughs. Redefining Cheat Days and Self-Compassion As you navigate the challenges of weight loss, remember that perfection is not the goal. A cheat day once in a while can have benefits. It allows you to indulge in your favourite treats guilt-free, and it can prevent feelings of deprivation that might lead to binging. Embrace self-compassion and acknowledge that setbacks are part of the journey. When you have a less-than-ideal day, don’t let it discourage you. Get back on track with your next meal or workout, and keep moving forward. The Power of Support and Accountability Connecting with others who share your goals can be a game-changer. Whether it’s a friend, family member, or an online community, having a support system can provide motivation and accountability. Share your successes and challenges, celebrate victories together, and lift each other during tough times. Additionally, seeking professional guidance from a nutritionist, personal trainer, or therapist can provide expert insights tailored to your unique journey. Invictus Gym is a great place to find support for your fitness goals.

When you open up about your challenges, you create a connection that fosters understanding and motivation. By discussing how you overcame obstacles and the strategies you employed, you offer valuable insights to those who may be facing similar difficulties. Conclusion: Embrace the Journey In your pursuit of weight loss, remember that every hurdle you encounter is an opportunity for growth. The road to success is rarely linear; it’s filled with twists, turns, and occasional setbacks. By understanding and acknowledging the challenges you face, you are better equipped to overcome them.

    "text": "Intitolato a Gardini l’edificio di Marina che ospita il Centro di ricerca Ambiente, energia e mare. L’emozione di Maria Speranza e Ivan\n\"Mio padre sarebbe orgogliosissimo oggi, se fosse qui, nel vedere realizzato un suo sogno, il sogno di una Ravenna capitale dell’ambiente\". Viene intitolato a Raul Gardini, l’imprenditore ravennate della chimica, il complesso di Marina di Ravenna che ospita, dopo anni di abbandono, il Centro di ricerca Ambiente, energia e mare. In simultanea, la consegna del Premio per tesi in sua memoria voluto dalla Fondazione creata dai figli Eleonora, Ivan e Maria Speranza, che si emoziona: \"Attraverso questo centro Ravenna porterà avanti sguardi verso una prospettiva futura nell’ambito della ricerca industriale e dello sviluppo sostenibile\". \"È un dovere verso il passato – dice il sindaco Michele de Pascale -, il Centro fu realizzato da lui, poi abbandonato e riqualificato dal Comune di Ravenna. Ora, con l’Università di Bologna, è tornato a essere un centro di ricerca\".\nUn dovere condiviso dalla professoressa Mirella Falconi, presidente anche di Fondazione Flaminia, e dal prefetto Castrese De Rosa che ha sollecitato i giovani a costruire il futuro. \"Un futuro in mano a giovanissimi ricercatori, con la mente sgombra, come piaceva a lui\", aggiunge Ivan Gardini. Il programma di borse di studio messo a disposizione dalla Fondazione che porta il nome dell’imprenditore \"consolida il ruolo del Centro nell’ambito della ricerca industriale sulle tecnologie per l’ambiente\", dichiara l’assessore all’Università Fabio Sbaraglia. Il Premio di 7mila euro è stato suddiviso equamente tra Alessia Alcantarini e Sara El Yamani, membri del team della futura start up, che hanno svolto gran parte del lavoro accademico col professor Andrea Contin per un progetto che valorizza gli scarti agroindustriali facendone materiali e fertilizzanti sostenibili. A consegnarlo il Rettore dell’Università di Bologna, Giovanni Molari, che nei giorni scorsi ha attribuito la laurea ad honorem in Scienze Agrarie a Emmanuelle Charpentier, premio Nobel per la Chimica nel 2020, la stessa assegnata a Raul Gardini nel 1987. \"A distanza di quarant’anni hanno lanciato lo stesso messaggio – sottolinea Molari -. La ricerca deve essere fatta insieme alle imprese e uscire all’esterno\". Per l’esponente repubblicano Giannantonio Mingozzi fu fondamentale l’intuizione di metterla a disposizione della crescita economica del Paese per creare brevetti e lavoro. Il progetto di istituire un premio per tesi, con il professor Fabio Fava referente scientifico per la Fondazione Gardini, è anche frutto del legame di Raul con il suo amico di sempre, scomparso di recente, il giornalista del Resto del Carlino Vanni Ballestrazzi. \"Anche lui – racconta Ivan Gardini - desiderava ricordarlo in questo modo: premiare teste giovani che mettano a terra progetti lungimiranti per l’ambiente e il nostro territorio. Questo amava nostro padre e questo vorremmo fare con la Fondazione\".\nMaria Vittoria Venturelli\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",

Parlando infatti della \"fedeltà alla democrazia\" come loro \"tratto distintivo\", il Pontefice rimarca che \"oggi ne abbiamo tanto bisogno\". Una sottolineatura significativa da parte di Francesco, alla vigilia della Festa della Repubblica e a una settimana dal voto per le Europee.\n E il Papa non manca di rilevare che \"democratica è quella società in cui c'è davvero un posto per tutti, nella realtà dei fatti e non solo nelle dichiarazioni e sulla carta\". Il suo riferimento è a \"chi rischia l'emarginazione: i giovani, ai quali in particolare destinate le iniziative di formazione professionale; le donne, che spesso continuano a patire forme di discriminazione e disuguaglianza; i lavoratori più fragili e i migranti, che nelle Acli trovano qualcuno capace di aiutarli a ottenere il rispetto dei propri diritti\". E infine \"gli anziani e i pensionati, che troppo facilmente si ritrovano 'scartati' dalla società. E questa è un'ingiustizia\".\n Il servizio a queste persone, \"non deve soltanto restare nell'ambito dell'assistenza - avverte il Pontefice -, ma promuovere la dignità di ogni persona e la possibilità che ciascuno possa mettere in campo le proprie risorse e il proprio contributo\".\n Nell'udienza nell'Aula Paolo VI, davanti a seimila 'aclisti' con in prima fila il presidente nazionale Emiliano Manfredonia e l'accompagnatore spirituale, il gesuita padre Giacomo Costa, il Papa mette in evidenza il loro \"stile pacifico, cioè da operatori di pace\", e assicura che \"in un mondo insanguinato da tante guerre, so di condividere con voi l'impegno e la preghiera per la pace\".\n \"Le Acli siano voce di una cultura della pace - raccomanda -, uno spazio in cui affermare che la guerra non è mai 'inevitabile' mentre la pace è sempre possibile; e che questo vale sia nei rapporti tra gli Stati, sia nella vita delle famiglie, delle comunità e nei luoghi di lavoro\". Secondo Francesco, \"costruisce la pace chi sa prendere posizione con chiarezza, ma al tempo stesso si sforza di costruire ponti, di ascoltare e comprendere le diverse parti in causa, promuovendo il dialogo e la riconciliazione\". Ed \"intercedere per la pace è qualcosa che va ben oltre il semplice compromesso politico, perché richiede di mettersi in gioco e assumere un rischio. Il nostro mondo, lo sappiamo, è segnato da conflitti e divisioni, e la vostra testimonianza di operatori di pace, di intercessori per la pace, è quanto mai necessaria e preziosa\", aggiunge.\n \"Avendo ottant'anni siete un po' più giovani di me\", scherza Bergoglio nel suo discorso, suscitando l'ilarità dei presenti. E rileva che nelle Acli \"è possibile incontrare dei 'santi della porta accanto'\", che \"non finiscono sulle prime pagine dei giornali, ma a volte cambiano concretamente le cose, in bene!\": questo ricordando le \"tante persone che, attraverso le Acli, hanno dedicato la loro vita al servizio dei lavoratori, dei pensionati, dei giovani, degli stranieri e di tanti che si trovano in situazioni di bisogno\". E dell'associazione, oltre che lo stile \"democratico\" e \"pacifico\", evidenzia quello \"popolare\", \"sinodale\" e \"cristiano\".\n Durante l'incontro, viene portata alla presenza del Pontefice la statua di San Giuseppe Lavoratore che papa Pio XII benedisse nel 1955. E a fine udienza l'appuntamento è in Piazza San Pietro, dove i partecipanti danno vita a un flash mob per la pace srotolando due bandiere giganti da 20 per 30 metri.",
