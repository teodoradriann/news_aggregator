    "text": "Unions have urged schools still using performance-related pay (PRP) to ditch the “shoddy practice”, after polling reveals some have retained it.\nThe government removed the “bureaucratic requirement” for schools to use PRP this academic year, after its workload reduction taskforce secured a pledge it would be axed in January.\nBut 10 per cent of teachers surveyed this month said they still had performance targets related to exam results that were tied to pay progression.\nHowever, Teacher Tapp also found the number of teachers with targets related to pay had almost halved since its last survey in 2022 – and that it has been on the wane since 2018.\n“There is no longer a requirement for schools to continue the shoddy practice of [PRP], which is workload intensive, and damaging to morale and industrial relations,” said Dr Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT.\nHe said any school that continued to use PRP could “expect to be challenged robustly”.\nPepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the ASCL leaders’ union, urged leaders “still using this approach to review the policy as a matter of urgency”.\nPRP ‘works poorly in practice’ The government’s workload reduction taskforce concluded PRP “works poorly in practice and does not have a commensurate positive impact on teaching and learning”.\nIt has since been removed as a requirement from the school teachers’ pay and conditions document.\nBut elements still exist when it comes to teachers progressing on to the upper pay scale. Academies are also not obliged to follow national pay and conditions.\nTen per cent of the 9,321 teachers surveyed by Teacher Tapp this month said they still had PRP.\nDi’Iasio But the proportion who reported they had targets linked to pay and results had nearly halved since Teacher Tapp last asked the question in November 2022.\nGrainne Hallahan, Teacher Tapp’s head of community, said the DfE might “take credit” for the fall.\nBut Teacher Tapp also noted “fewer and fewer” teachers had been reporting they had targets related to pay progression in surveys since 2018.\n“This suggests many schools were moving away from a results-based form of PRP long before the government removed the requirement to base pay increases on performance,” said James Zuccolo, the director for school workforce at the Education Policy Institute.\nChanges will take ‘some time to implement’ Alistair Wood, the chief executive of Edapt, which provides legal support for teachers, suggested PRP persisted “mainly due to a logistical issue rather than a strong ideological one”.\nWhile the announcement about PRP was made in January, the DfE did not release guidance until July and the pay and conditions document was not updated until September.\n“It’s not particularly surprising that there is a bit of a lagging effect as schools wait for certainty before changing a policy that is likely to be met with a large degree of scrutiny,” Wood said.\nPay policies also need to be approved by governors.\nColin Lofthouse, the chief executive of Smart Multi-Academy Trust, which has 11 academies in Newcastle and Gateshead, said its new policy would not be in place until next September.\n“We haven’t officially moved policy to say that there is no link between one and the other, but in practice that’s exactly what happens.”\nWood added that in theory PRP went beyond exam results, and that schools might have other metrics for measuring performance. The data could therefore “under-report the amount of PRP still going on”.\nEvidence suggests impact of PRP limited Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) research in 2021 found the impact of PRP was “low”.\nIt suggested schools consider more “cost-effective ways” to boost teacher performance, such as quality professional development.\nChris Paterson, the co-chief executive at the EEF, said there was a risk of “unintended consequences – such as teachers focusing disproportionately on tested outcomes, rather than the wider curriculum and pupil learning experience”.\nZuccollo added that the goal of PRP was to motivate teachers, retain good staff by rewarding them well, and attract people to the profession.\nWhile a large study by UCL in 2021 found there was no evidence of a link between PRP and retention, internationally the evidence is mixed.\nZuccollo said this meant it would work well in some schools but not in others.\n“England has a diverse range of settings and the government is right to leave choices about remuneration to school leaders, rather than mandating any single approach for all.”",

Sem a proteção na frente, o motorista resolveu usar um capacete com viseira enquanto dirigia, segundo a Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF), que fez o flagrante durante uma fiscalização na rodovia.\nAlém das partes amarradas com cordas na cabine, a fiscalização encontrou ainda diversas peças soltas, quase caindo para fora do veículo. O tanque de combustível da carreta também estava tampado apenas com um elástico e um saco plástico.\nO motorista, de 63 anos, confessou aos policiais que sofreu um acidente com a carreta na divisa entre o Mato Grosso e Pará, mas decidiu seguir rodando mesmo assim, no caminho de volta até Garibaldi, no Rio Grande do Sul. A viagem total duraria três dias, percorrendo mais de 3 mil quilômetros.\nLeia a reportagem completa em NSC Total, parceiro do Metrópoles.",

    "title": "Surge in California electric vehicle sales could hurt state's fight against pollution",
    "text": "News\nSurge in California electric vehicle sales could hurt state’s fight against pollution\nCalifornia leaders who want to fight pollution now face a quandary - and it stems, oddly, from the rise of electric cars.\nAs more people buy fuel-efficient or zero-emission vehicles, the public's consumption of gas has declined, and so has the revenue that California draws from gas taxes.\nWhat might seem like environmental progress at first glance has become \"increasingly problematic,\" said Brian Taylor, a professor of urban planning and researcher at UCLA's Institute of Transportation Studies, addressing a committee of state legislators on Monday.\nTaylor and others have laid out the conundrum in stark terms. Gas tax revenues, estimated to be $13.3 billion last year, could fall to as low as $4.8 billion by 2040, according to modeling by the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose. That money pays to fix crumbling roads and repair bridges, but it also helps bolster public transit, bicycle infrastructure and other car alternatives that are essential if the state plans to go carbon neutral by 2045.\nAsha Weinstein Agrawal, education director at Mineta, presented the institute's predictions in a series of charts during Monday's joint hearing of the state Assembly and Senate transportation committees. The charts showed how dramatically the state's revenue could fall, depending on how quickly electric vehicles overtake the market.\n\"We are going to lose revenue soon - visibly - within the next few years,\" Agrawal said.\nFor all their benefits, Taylor said at the hearing, electric vehicles still create problems. Equipped with heavy batteries, these fuel-efficient cars and trucks tend to weigh more than their counterparts with internal combustion engines, so they do more damage to roads. They also accelerate more quickly, which increases the risk of collisions, and they contribute to traffic congestion, just like any other vehicles.\nClearly, electric vehicles \"impose costs on society and on the road system,\" Taylor said, but they aren't burdened with the same fuel taxes as gas-powered cars.\nGas taxes serve multiple goals. One is to fund a sprawling, intricate transportation system that requires constant maintenance. Another is to get drivers to pay for use of a precious utility. A third purpose, Taylor said, is to \"influence behavior\": people who drive more, pay more.\nBut the whole calculus fails with the shift to fuel-efficient vehicles.\n\"The way we see it, we're staring both down a steep slope of declining revenues, as well as an absolute cliff,\" said James Corless, executive director of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments.\nHe tried to convey the depth of the state's predicament while acknowledging that it stems, at least partly, from successful efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Not only are people buying electric vehicles; regional planning has made communities more walkable and bikeable, enabling people to travel without driving.\nAgarwal suggested various policy solutions, including new taxes or fees that could hinge on how many miles a driver travels, or how many cars a household owns. She encouraged the state to act soon, given the daunting cost of maintaining a statewide transportation network.\nTanisha Taylor, executive director of the California Transportation Commission, echoed that point. As gas tax money dwindles, she said, counties throughout the state will have fewer funds to pave streets, fix potholes and build bike paths.\nIn a particularly cruel irony, California may even lose money to build zero-emission freight infrastructure, a key component of the effort to go carbon neutral.\nReach Rachel Swan: rswan@sfchronicle.com\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

    "text": "Electric vehicle drivers throughout Oregon will have a more reliable public charging experience over the next few years thanks to a federal grant program sending $10 million to Oregon for public EV charger repairs and station upgrades.\nThe $10 million grant will repair broken EV charging ports at public EV charging stations throughout the state. The funding can also be used to install more Level 2 or DC fast charging ports at project sites.\nThe ODOT Climate Office will oversee the grant fund distribution in Oregon.\nGiven this is a new federal grant program, we’re still working on the best, most efficient way to distribute the funds and how to engage the private sector. The charging stations are owned by private companies, so we’ll work with them to repair broken charging ports and upgrade stations.\nPer federal rules, private companies are required to contribute 20% matching funds in order to receive grant funding.\nWe expect charging port repair and station upgrade projects to start by the end of 2024. We’ll update you on the timeline later this year via email.\nThe grant comes from the federal Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program . It’s part of the $5 billion investment in public EV charging nationwide from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and overseen by the Federal Highway Administration.\nODOT was among 24 grant recipients in 20 states, and one of the 14 state DOTs to receive funding.\nThe Federal Highway Administration has identified 135 public EV charging stations in Oregon that have at least one broken EV charging port — either Level 2 or DC fast chargers — that are eligible for repairs or upgrades using grant funds.\nWe created an online map of those public EV charging stations identified by the FHWA: view the map on Google Maps.\nNote: This map is not the final list of charging stations that will receive funds for repairs or upgrades. It’s the pool of potential sites from which the final sites will be selected.\nWe do not have details yet on the final list of stations, but we’re working on that process now, and we’ll share more information with you later this year via email.\nSign up for email updates about our EV charging infrastructure work .\nHere’s more specifics on the potential work to be covered by these funds. These are estimates because private sector participation and project costs will vary.\nLevel 2 charging ports repaired: Up to 148. New Level 2 charging ports installed: Up to 208. DC fast charging ports repaired: Up to 35. New DC fast charger ports installed: Up to 30. As of January 2024, there are about 2,900 public EV charging ports in Oregon (Level 2 and DC fast chargers) among 1,160 stations. There are roughly 80,000 registered EVs in Oregon, as of the latest data from September 2023.\nEV charger reliability is critical to speed EV growth and foster confidence among EV drivers throughout Oregon. If more people can imagine an EV fitting into their daily lives, then they may consider an EV for their next vehicle purchase.\nSpurring the transition to EVs is one of the ways we’re working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in Oregon. By 2050, our data says we’re on track to reduce emissions by about 60% below 1990 levels. Learn how we’ll get there on Oregon’s transportation emissions website\nSource: ODOT",

    "title": "Low snow, drought concerns UM climate office",
    "text": "Snowpack this winter continues to be at an all-time low across several river basins in western Montana, indicating that this year could see water shortages, according to recent projections from the Montana Climate Office. The MCO is based at the University of Montana in the W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation. MCO produces daily summaries of drought conditions for the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB), Washington, Oregon and Idaho to help state and local governments make timely and informed decisions about drought. “At this point in the season, we don’t anticipate a recovery in many locations,” said Kyle Bocinsky, MCO director of climate extension. “The public should know that it really is not looking good for our water supply going into the spring and summer.” He said this is especially true in basins experiencing the most significant snowpack deficits, including the Blackfoot, Middle and South Forks of the Flathead, and Sun and Smith River basins. Based on the current projections, Bocinsky said, there will be less water for agriculture and recreation, with bad news as well for fisheries. He anticipates that there will be earlier closures for rafting and fishing and limitations for anglers such as hoot-owl restrictions. Data on snowpack conditions are included as part of the UMRB Drought Indicators interactive dashboard, available at https://drought.climate.umt.edu/. The dashboard presents data from the SNOTEL snowpack monitoring network, which is composed of over 900 automated monitoring sites located in high-elevation mountain watersheds across the western U.S. For each SNOTEL station in the Upper Missouri River Basin the climate office derived the likely trajectory of future snowpack changes through the end of the season in order to provide information on water supply going into the spring and summer. Several SNOTEL stations in the northern Rockies continue to show near or below record-low snowpack. Water held in snowpack is a crucial resource for hydrological systems like streams and rivers, and this year’s deficits could lead to water shortages for various users at lower elevations. According to MCO Assistant State Climatologist Zachary Hoylman, streamflow and soil moisture are extremely important for Montana’s ecosystem and economy, and snowpack is the biggest source for both. The MCO drought indicators dashboard was created to help inform the Montana Drought and Water Supply Monitoring Committee on what to expect in the coming warmer months. Hoylman said among scientists who study snow there tends to be a sentiment that “there’s always a chance,” suggesting that things can recover. Oftentimes, forecasts won’t be taken seriously until closer to the end of the winter season, which in Montana is roughly April 15. But he said this wait-and-see approach can be harmful, particularly in low snow years. He said tools such as the MCO dashboard can help estimate how much water conservation is needed to sustain water throughout the year. Providing real-time data to drought monitoring committees can help give early warnings to communities so that they can adapt accordingly. With a more proactive approach, agricultural producers, land managers and watershed alliances can start preparing for potential drought scenarios. “The snow story is complicated, and there are a lot of pieces to it,” Hoylman said. “We’re trying to effectively tie everything together to provide accurate assessments of how much moisture there is in the snowpack across all elevations.” Both Hoylman and Bocinsky said that at this point it’s fairly certain 2024 will be the lowest or near lowest snowpack seen to date for some critical Montana watersheds. With three major American river headwaters here in Montana, this year’s dismal winter and subsequent low snowpack also could send ripple effects to communities downstream. Bocinsky said now is the time to start making a plan of action. Using the dashboard, policymakers and water managers can start to look at other low snowpack years, what the impacts were and how they might strategize for mitigating those impacts. For individuals who would like to monitor the situation themselves, the drought dashboard is available for the most up-to-date conditions. MCO researchers plan to write a paper codifying their work with the data. The paper will explain the methods, the utility of those methods in snow forecasting and how the model can also forecast streamflow in different watersheds come warmer months. They anticipate publication by next winter and hope the paper will help provide more accurate predictions for environmental conditions linked to snowpack in Montana.",

    "text": "Nuevas órdenes de aprehensión contra ocho militares por caso Ayotzinapa La Fiscalía General de la República (FGR) obtuvo nuevas órdenes de aprehensión en contra de los ocho militares acusados de participar en la desaparición de los 43 normalistas de Ayotzinapa. Esta vez el Ministerio Público Federal les imputará la comisión del delito de delincuencia organizada, confirmaron defensores de los integrantes de la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Sedena). De acuerdo con información proporcionada por el abogado Alejandro Robledo, alrededor del mediodía el mandamiento judicial fue cumplimentado en contra de tres de los elementos que recién habían obtenido el beneficio de enfrentar en libertad el proceso en el que se les acusa de desaparición forzada. A ese respecto, el litigante dijo desconocer las causas que se les imputan en esta nueva acusación, sin embargo, un testigo protegido de la FGR señaló que los militares colaboraban con el Cártel Guerreros Unidos, organización a la que se ha atribuido participaron directa en la desaparición de los 43 normalistas de Ayotzinapa. Robledo señaló a La Jornada que en este caso los militares que no han sido detenidos serán puestos a disposición del Ministerio Público y del juez que emitió el mandamiento judicial, “toda vez que no hay nada que ocultar y se trata de una chicana (como se conoce en el argot jurídico a realización de una nueva acusación a fin de mantener en cautiverio a una persona), y no tienen responsabilidad”. Los ocho militares que recién enfrentan su proceso penal en libertad y en contra de quienes ya se libró el nuevo mandamiento de captura son: Gustavo Rodríguez de la Cruz, Omar Torres Marquillo, Juan Andrés Flores Lagunes, Ramiro Manzanares Sanabria, Roberto de los Santos Eduviges, Eloy Estrada Díaz, Uri Yashiel Reyes Lazos y Juan Sotelo Díaz. Estos integrantes de la Sedena permanecieron detenidos desde junio del año pasado en el Campo Militar 1-A, en la Ciudad de México, y ahora de nueva cuenta serán internados en la misma prisión, y puestos a disposición del juez de la causa para que la audiencia inicial se realice a través de videoconferencia.
