    "title": "India Gold price today: Gold falls, according to FXStreet data",
    "text": "Gold prices fell in India on Thursday, according to data compiled by FXStreet.\nThe price for Gold stood at 9,221.16 Indian Rupees (INR) per gram, down compared with the INR 9,237.28 it cost on Wednesday.\nThe price for Gold decreased to INR 107,553.80 per tola from INR 107,743.10 per tola a day earlier.\nUnit measure | Gold Price in INR |\n---|---|\n1 Gram | 9,221.16 |\n10 Grams | 92,211.62 |\nTola | 107,553.80 |\nTroy Ounce | 286,807.10 |\nGold price continued to trade sideways, capped by the $3,300-$3,380 range on Wednesday. Bullion’s spike happened on reports of Powell’s firing. Bloomberg revealed that “A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity earlier Wednesday, said they expected Trump to move soon against the Fed chief. That was also the impression of some lawmakers following a Tuesday evening meeting, where Trump polled them on the possibility of moving against Powell.”\nWhen asked on Wednesday, Trump said that while “it’s highly unlikely,” he could still see removing the Fed chair for “fraud.”\nThe US Produce Price Index (PPI) in June dipped from 2.6% to 2.3% YoY, below estimates of 2.5%. Excluding volatile items, PPI cooled from 3% to 2.6%, below forecasts of 2.7%.\nAlthough factory inflation eased, the latest consumer inflation report in the US showed that prices jumped in June and are closing in on the 3% threshold, far from the Fed’s 2% goal.\nUS Treasury yields dipped on Wednesday, with the US 10-year Treasury yield, which usually correlates negatively with Gold, falling three basis points (bps) to 4.459%.\nInterest rate probability indicates that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current rates, with odds standing at 95% for a hold and 5% for a 25-basis-point rate cut at the July 30 meeting. Money markets had priced in less than 50 basis points (bps) of easing, with investors pricing in over 46 bps of rate cuts toward the end of the year.\nUS President Trump stated that another deal with India is forthcoming. He added that they would deal with Japan with the tariffs letter. He announced on Tuesday that the US reached an agreement with Indonesia, in which the latter will pay 19% tariffs, while US producers will pay 0%.\nFXStreet calculates Gold prices in India by adapting international prices (USD/INR) to the local currency and measurement units. Prices are updated daily based on the market rates taken at the time of publication. Prices are just for reference and local rates could diverge slightly.\nGold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.\nGold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.\nThe price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.\n(An automation tool was used in creating this post.)",

    "text": "Una perturbazione in arrivo provocherà forti piogge, nevicate e un generale peggioramento delle condizioni atmosferiche, coinvolgendo numerose regioni italiane. La causa di questo cambiamento repentino è il transito di masse d’aria fredda provenienti dal Nord Europa, che alimentano una vasta circolazione ciclonica nel Mediterraneo.\nAttualmente, il vortice depressionario si trova sopra la Spagna e sta influenzando l’Italia con piogge e temporali. Un secondo nucleo ciclonico si sta formando nei pressi delle Isole Baleari, diretto verso l’Italia. I primi effetti si sono già fatti sentire il 12 dicembre, in particolare su Sardegna e Sicilia, e ora si avvicinano le regioni tirreniche e il Nordovest, soprattutto basso Piemonte e Liguria di Ponente.\nLe previsioni per le prossime ore Nel corso delle prossime ore, la perturbazione proseguirà il suo movimento verso est, estendendo il maltempo su gran parte del Paese. La mattinata di venerdì 13 dicembre sarà caratterizzata da nubi dense, piogge sparse e possibili temporali, che si sposteranno dalla Sardegna verso la Toscana, il Lazio, l’Umbria e successivamente verso la Campania. Piogge persistenti si registreranno anche sulla Liguria di Ponente e sul basso Piemonte.\nLa fase di maltempo più marcata si registrerà nel pomeriggio e in serata, con piogge diffuse al Centro, soprattutto su Lazio e Toscana. La serata porterà un peggioramento anche al Nord, con fenomeni intensi nella Valle Padana centrale e orientale. Nel Sud, invece, il tempo resterà asciutto, con condizioni più miti.\nLa perturbazione porterà anche un ritorno della neve. Le precipitazioni nevose saranno più significative sulle zone montuose: sui rilievi del Nord, le nevicate saranno sporadiche, mentre sulla dorsale appenninica settentrionale e centrale, i fiocchi scenderanno già da 800/900 metri di quota, con accumuli fino a 1400/1500 metri nelle zone centrali.\nChe tempo farà nel weekend? Forti piogge e nevicate, le Regioni coinvolte (foto ANSA) – Blitz quotidiano Che tempo farà nel weekend Il maltempo si protrarrà per gran parte del weekend, concentrandosi soprattutto sulle regioni tirreniche del Centro e parte del Sud, con piogge che potrebbero intensificarsi.\nIl Dipartimento della Protezione Civile ha emesso un avviso di condizioni meteorologiche avverse . Per il 13 dicembre è stata valutata un’allerta gialla per il Lazio, la Campania, la Basilicata, la Sicilia e la Sardegna, a causa dei fenomeni meteo intensi previsti nelle prossime ore. Il vortice ciclonico che ha interessato l’Italia nei giorni scorsi sta tornando, quindi è necessario prestare attenzione.",

    "title": "“No es mentira”: Petro entró a la polémica de la ministra de Trabajo y la empresa Van Camp’s | Noticias hoy | EL ESPECTADOR",
    "text": "A través de su cuenta de X, el presidente Gustavo Petro compartió varios mensajes sobre el choque que generó la ministra del Trabajo, Gloria Inés Ramírez, al señalar que la empresa de atún Van Camp’s tendría colaboradores bajo supuestas malas condiciones laborales. Luego de que la compañía señalara que eso no es cierto, Petro defendió la postura de Ramírez y dijo que “tienen trabajadoras tercerizadas desde hace 20 años”. En uno de sus trinos compartió una denuncia contra Seatech Internacional, fabricante de la marca Van Camp’s, en la que se habla de una “actitud férreamente antisindical” de la empresa y de los supuestos contratos a través de bolsas de empleo, con los que trabajarían miles de empleados por 15, 16 y hasta 20 años. Lea también: Tras orden de la Contraloría, Petro suspendió al director de Gestión del Riesgo En otra publicación, el mandatario se refirió al testimonio de dos empleadas que denunciaron maltratos como descuentos del salario por el tiempo que requieren para ir al baño. “Mujeres trabajadoras y negras. Por eso las explotan, por eso no las escuchaban. Toda la fuerza del gobierno respaldándolas. Estamos con ustedes”, dijo. Más temprano, el presidente ya había compartido uno de los videos de las trabajadoras, en el cual una de ellas denuncia que la empresa las está “obligando a usar paños desechables porque nos descuentan del día las idas al baño; eso no está produciendo, a futuro, enfermedades”. No se pierda: Gobernador electo de Antioquia insiste en referendo de autonomía para departamentos Según la empresa productora de Van Camp’s, las declaraciones de la ministra no son ciertas y atentan contra los más de 35 años de trayectoria de la compañía, por lo que se defenderán en instancias legales. Sin embargo, el Ministerio del Trabajo asegura que ha hecho dos visitas a Seatech International Inc, en la sede de Cartagena, y que investiga 26 hallazgos por presuntas violaciones laborales. En un comunicado publicado este jueves, la cartera señala que se investigan las querellas de las trabajadoras por un “descuento ilegal en salarios por control del tiempo en las necesidades fisiológicas”. Además, explica que la compañía en cuestión enfrenta 10 procesos activos, uno de ellos por presuntamente “realizar retenciones o descuentos a los salarios de los trabajadores sin autorización”. Por último, advierte que el ministerio adelantó ocho procesos sancionatorios que ascienden a más de $3.500 millones, tres directamente contra Seatech Internacional y los cinco restantes a la empresa temporal con la cual la compañía terceriza algunos servicios, Tiempo Servicios S.A.S. 👁‍🗨 Conozca cómo votan los senadores y representantes a la Cámara en ‘Congreso a la mano’. 👉 Lea más sobre el Congreso, el gobierno Petro y otras noticias del mundo político.",

    "title": "Pedro Sánchez, sobre la ruptura de Vox y PP: 'Es un gran día para España'",
    "text": "Pedro Sánchez, sobre la ruptura de Vox y PP: \"Es un gran día para España\" El presidente del Gobierno, que asiste a la cumbre de la OTAN de Nueva York, espera ahora que el Partido Popular de Feijóo rompa acuerdos en los ayuntamientos. El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, ha celebrado la [salida de Vox de los gobiernos autonómicos en los que gobierna con el PP](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/abascal-confirma-ruptura-todos-gobiernos-coalicion-pp-vox-pasara-oposicion.html) y en la rueda de prensa en la que pone fin a la agenda oficial de España en la cumbre de la OTAN celebrada en Nueva York, le ha puesto deberes al líder de los populares, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, al que le ha exigido ahora que dé un paso más allá, rompiendo los pactos con la extrema derecha en los ayuntamientos y, además, derogue [las \"contrarreformas\" aprobadas este último año](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/unno-gobiernos-pp-vox-factura-deja-memoria-democratica-igualdad.html) y se sume a la reforma de la Ley de Extranjería propuesta por su Ejecutivo. \"Hoy es un gran día para España\", ha afirmado Pedro Sánchez después de subrayar que el hecho de que Vox no vaya a estar en los gobiernos autonómicos hace a \"España un país mejor\". El presidente del Gobierno, en todo caso, ha destacado que pese a que en los próximos días habrá mucha \"politiquería\" para interpretar qué va a pasar después de este divorcio, los españoles son los que van a salir beneficiados de esta separación política. \"El responsable de meter a la ultraderecha en los gobiernos es uno, pero los beneficiarios de la salida de Vox de las Comunidades Autónomas somos todos. Especialmente todas\", ha recalcado un sonriente Pedro Sánchez, quien ha sido incapaz de ocultar su \"alegría y felicidad\" respecto a [una separación anunciada](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/vox-advierte-entiende-pp-roto-acuedos-partidosbr.html) y que Santiago Abascal se ha encarado de consumar este jueves después de la convocatoria de una reunión urgente y extraordinaria del Comité Ejecutivo Nacional del partido ultra. \"La prueba del algodón para el PP\" Más allá de la salida de Vox de los [gobiernos autonómicos en los que gobernaba junto al Partido Popular](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/los-gobiernos-autonomicos-pp-vox-todas-consejerias-controlan-abascal.html), una decisión que toma el partido de Santiago Abascal y no el de Núñez Feijóo, como ha destacado el presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez ha instado a que la dirección del PP vaya más allá y rompa también con todos los acuerdos firmados con la formación ultra y le dé la vuelta a todas las políticas restrictivas aprobadas hasta hoy. Por ello, Pedro Sánchez exige al Partido Popular que acepte la propuesta de reforma de la Ley de Extranjería que ha rechazado al no haber tenido tiempo para su análisis y en la que se establecería como obligatorio el reparto de los menores migrantes no acompañados de las Islas Canarias, entre las comunidades autónomas de la Península. \"Sería la prueba del algodón de que el PP ha roto con las políticas de Vox\", ha indicado el presidente del Gobierno, quien ha señalado que es el momento de que el Partido Popular sea un partido de Estado y dé soluciones a los problemas de los ciudadanos, vivan donde vivan. Según indica, sería \"la prueba del algodón\" de que el PP \"ha roto con las políticas de Vox\", dado que esta crisis viene provocada por la negativa de esta formación a aceptar el reparto de menores migrantes. El presidente considera que ha quedado demostrado que la estrategia de \"gobernar con la ultraderecha ha fracasado\" y reitera que es una gran noticia para los españoles, porque estos gobiernos han aprobado políticas \"ultraderechistas\" en materias como violencia de género, memoria democrática, servicios sociales y calidad de servicios públicos, transición ecológica y también sobre cambio climático, según ha enumerado. Preguntado por la posibilidad de que el PSOE garantice la estabilidad de los gobiernos autonómicos del PP de los que sale Vox, se ha limitado decir que en aquellos territorios donde el PSOE ejerza de oposición, seguirá haciéndolo de forma constructiva. \"Por tanto, dependerá de las políticas que proponga el Gobierno autonómico de turno a la Asamblea correspondiente el que cuente con el apoyo o no del Partido Socialista\", ha añadido. El presidente del Gobierno cree que la estrategia de Alberto Núñez Feijóo de gobernar con la ultraderecha, con la ruptura de PP y Vox, queda demostrado que \"ha fracasado\" y, tal y como ha reiterado, eso supone una gran noticia teniendo en cuenta todas las cosas que han aprobado esos gobiernos en materia de violencia de género, servicios sociales y calidad de servicios públicos, cambio climático y memoria democrática, como la [ley de Concordia aprobada este jueves en las Cortes valencianas](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/pp-vox-derogan-ley-memoria-democratica-valenciana-iguala-democracia-franquismobr.html) antes del divorcio político.",

    "title": "After TikTok, Venezuela blocks VPN websites",
    "text": "Venezuela has reportedly blocked more than twenty websites from some of the country’s top VPN providers.\nThese online restrictions came a day after President Maduro imposed a ban on TikTok for failing to appoint a local representative.\nIndeed, people have turned to VPNs in droves as a means to continue accessing the video-sharing app. Proton VPN confirmed to Ny Breaking a 1,600% increase in signups across the country to date.\n🚨EN DESARROLLO:Amanecieron bloqueados en Venezuela 🛑 With the 30 DNS públicos como 8.8.8.8🛑 With the 20 sites web the VPN🛑 TikTokhttps://t.co/XDUUBHBwic #9Ene Esto has much more difficult information and estar communication, and other cases may result in a connection operation… January 9, 2025\nToday, January 9, 2024, Venezuelan digital rights group Ve Sin Filtro reports this that more than 20 VPN provider websites have also been blocked. These include Proton VPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN and IPVanish.\nA virtual private network (VPN) is security software that encrypts your Internet connections while spoofing your real IP address location. This last skill is exactly what is needed to circumvent restrictions such as those currently in place in Venezuela.\nAccording to Ve Sin Filtro, Tor Browser and more than 30 DNS services are also restricted.\nThis is not the first time that the government has focused on circumventing tools to prevent citizens from circumventing online restrictions. In July, ahead of the presidential elections, citizens complained about problems using VPN apps.\nAt the time, Proton VPN suggested searching for applications directly through the AppStore or Google Play Store when using a mobile device. On the desktop you can download the VPN via the GitHub platform by clicking the “Code” button.\nNy Breaking has contacted some of the companies involved to confirm this, but at the time of writing we are still waiting for a response.\n21 VPN providers affected This is the full list of the VPN websites that are restricted in Venezuela as we write this, according to data from Ve Sin Filtro:\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA) is one of the big names not currently on this list. Jack Buckley, Privacy Advocate at PIA, confirmed to Ny Breaking that both the PIA VPN app and the provider’s official website are working as usual.\nHe said: “Even though we are not directly affected by this issue and the data is still coming in, we are seeing the impact of Venezuela’s lockdown efforts. While full figures are not yet available, PIA is already seeing a 270% increase in website traffic from Venezuela at this early stage.”\nThe TikTok ban remains in place The Ven Sin Filtro team also confirmed that the TikTok blocking continues in Venezuela at the time of writing.\nInternet watchdog NetBlocks first reported the block will begin at midnight on January 8, 2025, “following a pattern of daily multi-hour restrictions.”\nThe blocking comes as the popular Chinese video-sharing app failed to meet the eight-day deadline set by the Venezuelan Supreme Court to appoint a local representative.",
