    "text": "By Ehren Wynder ,\n4 hours ago June 6 (UPI) -- A federal judge on Thursday ordered former White House adviser Steve Bannon to report to prison by July 1 after an appeals court upheld his conviction.\nSteve Bannon, former adviser to Donald Trump, would be the second Trump aide to serve prison time for defying the House Jan. 6 subcommittee after Peter Navarro, who was ordered to begin his sentence in March. File Photo by Jemal Countess/UPI Bannon, who briefly served in Donald Trump 's White House, was found guilty in July 2022 on two counts of contempt of Congress for failing to testify and provide documents to the now-disbanded House Jan. 6 subcommittee.\nHe was sentenced to serve four months behind bars in October that same year, but he has been able to avoid prison time as he pursued his appeal.\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols revoked the pause in Bannon's sentence after a three-judge D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel last month rejected his appeal.\nNichols on Thursday said, after the appeals court's decision, he did not believe the basis for continuing to hold off Bannon's sentence \"exists any longer.\"\nSteve Bannon (pictured, 2022) would be the second former Trump adviser to serve prison time for contempt of Congress. Former Trump aide Peter Navarro is currently serving four months -- also on contempt of Congress charges for defying the Jan. 6 subcommittee. File Photo by Jemal Countess/UPI The judge's ruling is a victory for federal prosecutors, who after the appeals court's ruling called for Bannon to begin his sentence , arguing \"there is no longer a 'substantial question of law that is likely to result in a reversal or an order for a new trial.'\"\nBannon's lawyer, David Schoen , argued there was \" no basis \" for his client to begin his sentence immediately, as he can still appeal Nichols' ruling to the full appeals court and then to the Supreme Court .\nA federal judge on Thursday ordered former White House adviser Steve Bannon (pictured, 2022) to report to prison by July 1 after an appeals court upheld his conviction.

On Wednesday, he sentenced a rioter who assaulted Capitol police with bear spray to more than six years in federal prison.\nHe also has rejected the governments use of the obstruction of an official proceeding charge, which has been leveled against hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, including Trump.\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case in April, with justices in the court's conservative majority arguing the use of the statute against a Jan. 6 defendant was over broad.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "TORRANCE, Calif. — A woman was killed after she was attacked with a sledgehammer at a college on Christmas Eve in Torrance, California. The assault happened Sunday just after 7 a.m. in the 16000 block of Crenshaw Boulevard, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said, according to KABC . Investigators say that the victim was collecting recyclables at El Camino College in Torrance when she was attacked, the news station reported. A man with a sledgehammer attacked her and fled the area before law enforcement arrived, according to KTLA. The victim was spotted by the gymnasium by someone passing by the area. Officers found her unconscious and she appeared to be bleeding from her head, the news outlet reported. Her dog stayed at her side. The victim was taken to the hospital where she died a day later on Christmas from her injuries, KTLA reported. The sheriff’s department only identified the victim as an Asian woman between the ages of 60 and 65, according to the Los Angeles Times. Investigators identified the suspect through surveillance footage as Jeffrey Davis, 40, according to KTLA. “The person that we had an idea of who was on the security footage is, we believe, a homeless person we’ve had contact with before,” said Sgt. Francisco Esqueda of El Camino College Police, according to the news outlet. “So we were able to go to the neighboring county park where he sometimes hangs out and that’s where we found him.” Davis was arrested shortly after the incident, the LA Times reported.",

    "text": "To the person who has never left,\nApproaching a new decade of my life means I am closing the door to my current one. I have spent another ten years watching others and learning, otherwise known as people-watching. I have spent a lot of time on the sidelines when it comes to a few things, one in particular is watching people our age experience love: real, true love. For years, I’ve been waiting to get the chance to understand what that feels like, to understand how it feels to have someone who really, truly cares about me. I’ve been waiting to understand how it feels to have someone who never wants to leave my side, someone who wants to experience life with me, someone who chooses to love me. But recently I have realized that I do understand how it feels to have someone like that: it’s you. You choose to love me, you care for me and you want to experience life with me. I may have not yet found the person I’m going to be in a romantic relationship with, but I have without a doubt experienced being loved.\nA way I know I’ve learned what real love is from your sincerity. Having a person in my life as sincere as you is all I can ask for. There’s never been any competition between us. We never compare, but rather challenge each other. We truly want each other to succeed and be the best version of ourselves.\nTo be a good person is to be half the person you are, and I think we both know I’m not even that. You once wrote, “I keep you aligned, and you keep me on edge.” It’s incredibly true but as any person who loves another, you have made sure to give it to me straight always. You call me out when I need to be, letting me know that you genuinely want the best for me always.\nDespite the distance and our individual journeys of life, we have always made sure to remain constant in each other’s lives. We make sure to hold each other accountable. We encourage each other. We are proud of each other. For as long as I can remember, we have always been planning our life together. I mean, if we can survive distance, we can survive anything, right?\nIt seems like all I hear about is romantic relationships, but, truthfully, platonic relationships are just as strong and meaningful. The strength of our friendship is beyond words. We will be at each other’s weddings, not getting married to each other, but standing right behind the other as they say “I do” to the love of their life. We will get a house, not together, but close enough so we can have movie nights every night. We’ll start a family, not together, but we’ll be the ‘madrina’ to each other’s firstborn. We’ll experience life together. To think I was never going to find someone who loved me is bizarre because I’ve already been lucky enough to find you: someone who has loved me for years. There has been so much change in our life- school, jobs, friends, homes- but there has been one constant; that constant is you, which is just as incredible as a boyfriend or husband.\nLove,\nYour Best Friend",

Dijo que estaba “cada vez más desquiciado e inestable” y citó los comentarios críticos sobre Trump que realizó John Kelly , el exjefe de gabinete en los tiempos en que el republicano estuvo en la Casa Blanca.En una entrevista con The New York Times , Kelly describió a Trump como alguien que “ciertamente entra en la definición general de los fascistas” y que había expresado palabras favorables hacia Adolf Hitler en varias ocasiones.Harris aseguró que su rival quería tener “poder sin control”. Más tarde, durante un debate ciudadano auspiciado por la cadena CNN, le preguntaron si creía que Trump era un “fascista”, a lo que respondió: “Sí, lo creo” . Recomendamos Poco después, Trump publicó en sus redes sociales que los comentarios de Harris eran una señal de que estaba perdiendo. Dijo que ella estaba “elevando cada vez más su retórica, llegando a llamarme Adolf Hitler, y cualquier otra cosa que se le ocurra en su retorcida mente”.En la recta final de las campañas políticas, especialmente en una tan reñida como la presidencial de 2024, los mensajes de los candidatos tienden naturalmente a volverse negativos . Los ataques suelen ser más eficaces para motivar a los simpatizantes a acudir a las urnas y perturbar las campañas de los contrincantes.Sin embargo, la actitud más dura de Harris hacia Trump contrasta con los mensajes optimistas y “alegres” de los primeros días de su campaña.Harris se apartó en gran medida del mensaje central de la campaña del presidente Joe Biden de que Trump suponía una amenaza existencial para la democracia estadounidense.Sin embargo, según el estratega político Matt Bennett, del grupo demócrata centrista Third Way, está claro por qué Harris se ha decantado cada vez más a amplificar el oscuro retrato de Kelly de Trump como un hombre con tendencias autoritarias. “Todo lo que hace ahora es por táctica” , dijo. “El imperativo era asegurarse de que el mayor número posible de votantes conociera lo que dijo Kelly”.Las últimas declaraciones de la vicepresidenta se producen tras una estrategia de varias semanas de su campaña para atraer a votantes independientes y republicanos moderados que podrían estar abiertos a apoyar la candidatura demócrata.Las encuestas sugieren que la competencia está muy reñida y que ninguno de los candidatos tiene una ventaja decisiva en ninguno de los estados clave.Los suburbios alrededor de las ciudades más grandes en los estados “bisagra” - Filadelfia, Detroit, Milwaukee y Phoenix, por ejemplo - están poblados por profesionales con educación universitaria que tradicionalmente han votado por los republicanos, pero que las encuestas indican tienen dudas sobre el regreso de Trump a la Casa Blanca .“Su argumento para ganar es crear una coalición lo más amplia posible y atraer a los republicanos descontentos, gente que no cree que pueda volver a votar a Trump”, dijo Bennett.Devynn DeVelasco, una ciudadana de 20 años en Nebraska que se declara independiente, es una de las que ya se habían convencido de no votar a Trump por la larga lista de republicanos de alto rango, que trabajaron para el entonces presidente y que dicen que su exjefe no es apto para el cargo.Aunque espera que algunos republicanos se unan a ella para apoyar a Harris, le preocupa que los señalamientos que se hacen sobre el expresidente generen cansancio entre los votantes.“Cuando estos reportes [sobre los comentarios de Kelly] salieron, no me sorprendió, no son muy novedosos”, dijo DeVelasco a la BBC.La estratega republicana Denise Grace Gitsham dijo que los votantes han estado escuchando una retórica similar sobre Trump desde 2016 , por lo que era poco probable que cualquier nueva acusación moviera la balanza.“Si vas a votar en contra de Donald Trump porque no te gusta su personalidad, ya eres un votante decidido”, explica Gitsham a la BBC. “Pero si eres alguien que se fija en las políticas y eso te importa más que la personalidad, entonces vas a elegir a quien sentiste que lo hizo mejor en la Casa Blanca”.Tanto Harris como Trump han afilado sus dardos en los últimos días. El lunes, durante una gira por los estados más disputados del Medio Oeste, Harris advirtió repetidamente de las consecuencias de una presidencia de Trump sobre el derecho al aborto, la salud, la economía y la política exterior estadounidense.El viernes celebrará un mitin en Texas, el estado que, según ella, representa de forma más dramática el futuro antiabortista del país si Trump vuelve al poder.El próximo martes se concentrará en Washington DC, con un mitin en el National Mall, donde Trump habló antes de que algunos de sus partidarios atacaran el Capitolio el 6 de enero de 2021.Trump, por su parte, ha continuado con su batería de ataques contra su rival demócrata. En un foro en Carolina del Norte , dijo que Harris era “perezosa” y “estúpida” y que solo llegó a ser candidata de su partido por su etnia y género.También lanzó su propia advertencia, diciendo que “puede que no quede un país” si gana Harris.Sin embargo, ninguna de estas frases supone un cambio especial para Trump, que ha pasado la mayor parte de su campaña atacando a los demócratas y ciñéndose a su mensaje central sobre inmigración, comercio y economía.El discurso de cierre de Harris, mientras tanto, dirigido a ganarse a los republicanos anti-Trump y a los independientes, no está exento de riesgos, dijo el estratega demócrata Bennett.“Siempre debes recortar una cosa para tratar de ayudar a promover otro mensaje”, explica Bennett. “El tiempo del candidato y el tiempo gastado en publicidad son los dos bienes más preciados. Y cómo los gastas importa”.Trump lleva más de ocho años siendo una figura polarizadora en la política estadounidense. La mayoría de los estadounidenses tienen opiniones muy arraigadas sobre él.Si el sentimiento anti-Trump lleva a Harris a la cima el día de las elecciones, su último énfasis estratégico habrá valido la pena. Si no, las dudas llegarán de forma rápida y furiosa. (I)",

    "title": "Dólar perde força na reta final do pregão e recua 0,22% com Lula no radar",
    "text": "27/06/2024 - 17:56\nEm dia marcado por volatilidade e trocas de sinal, o dólar à vista se firmou em baixa moderada na última hora de negócios e encerrou a sessão desta quinta-feira, 27, em queda de 0,22%, cotado a R$ 5,5075. Na máxima, no início da tarde, a moeda havia superado R$ 5,53, com máxima a R$ 5,5390.\nO movimento de apreciação do real na reta final do pregão se deu em meio a declarações do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sobre a política fiscal e a uma diminuição dos ganhos do dólar em relação a outras divisas latino-americanas, em especial o peso mexicano.\nEm entrevista à rádio Itatiaia, em Minas Gerais, Lula deu sinais de que está atento à pauta da redução de gastos. O presidente afirmou que “sempre há lugar para cortar no orçamento” e que o “Brasil tem muito subsídios e desoneração”.\nAo mencionar que o governo realiza uma “operação pente-fino” em todos os ministérios, Lula disse que por mais que “queria fazer política social”, o país não pode “jogar dinheiro fora”. Mais uma vez, o presidente comentou a depreciação do real, dizendo que “há muitas pessoas que querem viver de especulação, apostando na alta do dólar”.\nAlém disso, o presidente elogiou o atual diretor de Política Monetária do Banco Central, Gabriel Galípolo, nome mais cotado para substituir o presidente do BC, Roberto Campos Neto. Para Lula, Galípolo é um “menino de ouro, competente e honesto”, com “todas as condições de ser presidente do BC”. Parte do tombo recente do real esteve relacionado, segundo analistas, a temores de que Lula indique para a presidência do BC um nome historicamente ligado ao PT ou um economista heterodoxo.\n“A sensação que se tem é que esse patamar do dólar e a maneira com que o câmbio se depreciou começam a afetar Brasília. Temos ver o que vai sair agora de medidas. A parte difícil de fazer o ajuste fiscal é cortar gasto”, afirma o economista-chefe da Western Asset, Adauto Lima.\nPara o economista, medidas mais duras, como mudança de regras de crescimento de despesas, trariam resultados claros. Já revisão de gastos a partir da passagem de um “pente-fino” nas despesas pode até trazer até ganhos pontuais, mas não têm o poder de afastar a desconfiança dos investidores, uma vez que os números podem ser superestimados.\nOperadores afirmam que a formação da taxa de câmbio também esteve muito suscetível hoje a movimentos técnicos, com movimentos típicos de rolagem de posições no segmento futuro na virada do mês e a preparação para a disputa amanhã, 28, em torno da formação da última taxa Ptax de junho, do segundo trimestre e do primeiro semestre. O contrato de dólar futuro para julho teve giro forte, ao redor de US$ 20 bilhões.\nApesar do refresco hoje, o dólar ainda acumula alta de 1,23% na semana e de 4,89% no mês, o que leva a valorização da moeda americana no ano a 13,48%. O real é a segunda divisa global relevante que mais perde em relação ao dólar em 2024, atrás apenas do iene.\n“O real foi muito mal recentemente e hoje foi melhor que as outras divisas. O principal driver para a depreciação do real no ano é externo, com a valorização global do dólar, que acelerou recentemente. Mas os fatores idiossincráticos fizeram o real ir bem pior que os pares nos últimos três meses. É algo bem forte”, afirma Lima, da Western Asset.\nApesar da queda das taxas dos Treasuries e do leve recuo do índice DXY, as principais divisas latino-americanas, à exceção do real, perderam força hoje, em especial os pesos chileno e mexicano. O real andou na contramão na maior parte do dia, mas era perceptível que o maior ou menor grau de desvalorização dos pares se refletia no comportamento da moeda brasileira.\nOs momentos em que o dólar permaneceu abaixo de R$ 5,50 no fim da tarde coincidiram que com a diminuição dos ganhos da moeda americana em relação ao peso mexicano, na esteira da decisão do Banco Central do México (Banxico) de manter a taxa básica de juros do país em 11% ao ano.\nPela manhã, durante apresentação do Relatório Trimestral de Inflação (RT), em São Paulo, Roberto Campos Neto disse que o “câmbio apresentou uma desvalorização que está em linha com algumas várias que também simbolizam o prêmio de risco no Brasil”, como o juro da NTN-B longa. O presidente do BC reiterou que a autoridade monetária não vai intervir no câmbio para mirar uma cotação, mas apenas para corrigir eventual disfuncionalidade do mercado.",

    "text": "Venezuela anuncia ejercicio militar y acusa al Reino Unido de “provocación hostil” por buque en las costas de Guyana\nmacamilarincon\n(CNN Español) –– El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, anunció este jueves que ordenó una acción conjunta defensiva en respuesta a lo que señaló como una “provocación del Reino Unido” luego de que inicialmente la BBC reportara, citando al Ministerio de Defensa británico, que se enviaría un buque patrullero a las costas de Guyana.\n¿Cómo es la riqueza del Esequibo y cómo contribuyó al crecimiento exponencial de Guyana?\n“Por eso he ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la fuerza armada nacional militar bolivariana sobre el caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensiva como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país”, afirmó Maduro durante la ceremonia de salutación de fin de año a la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB).\nLa reacción de Venezuela sigue a un reporte de la BBC del domingo en el que indicaba, citando al Ministerio de Defensa, que el Reino Unido se preparaba para “enviar un buque de guerra a Guyana en una muestra de apoyo diplomático y militar a la antigua colonia británica”.\n¿Qué sigue ahora en la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana por el Esequibo? Puntos claves del acuerdo y posibles escenarios\nEl HMS Trent, un patrullero de la Marina británica, agregó la BBC, visitará Guyana, “aliado regional y socio de la Commonwealth, a finales de este mes como parte de una serie de compromisos en la región durante su despliegue de tareas de patrulla en el Atlántico”. El Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido confirmó a CNN en Londres esta declaración.\nMaduró calificó a la respuesta venezolana como “acción conjunta militar general Domingo Sifonte” en honor al general que Maduro considera héroe de la Guyana Esequiba y a quien, además, se le rendirá homenaje en enero “trayendo sus restos a que descanse definitivamente en el panteón de los héroes de Venezuela”.\nVenezuela y Guyana acuerdan seguir con diálogo sobre disputa del Esequibo\nLa Cancillería de Venezuela publicó un comunicado en rechazo a la llegada del buque británico y advirtió a la Comunidad del Caribe (Caricom) y a la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac) de que las acciones contradicen el entendimiento acordado el 14 de diciembre entre Venezuela y Guyana.\n“La presencia de la nave militar es extremadamente grave, ya que viene acompañada de declaraciones por parte de voceros políticos y militares de quien fungió como despojador de la Guyana Esequiba, el cual insiste en inmiscuirse en dicha controversia”, dice el comunicado.\nEl encuentro que se llevó a cabo el 14 de diciembre entre los mandatarios de Guyana y Venezuela en San Vicente y las Granadinas cerró con el compromiso de mantener la vía diplomática como el único camino para resolver el conflicto, y se estableció el acuerdo de 11 puntos suscrito por las partes y los mediadores de ambos países.\n“Venezuela insta a las autoridades guyanesas a tomar medidas inmediatas para el retiro del buque HMS Trent, y abstenerse de seguir involucrando a potencias militares en la controversia territorial”, afirma el comunicado.\nCNN está intentando comunicarse con el Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido por los informes de que personal militar venezolano participará en ejercicios militares en el golfo de Paria en respuesta al despliegue del HMS Trent en Guyana.\nOsmary Hernández colaboró con este reporte.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
