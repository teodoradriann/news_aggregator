    "text": "La tranquilidad de una noche en Boedo se vio interrumpida por un violento asalto en una pizzería local. Cuatro ladrones armados ingresaron al establecimiento, sembrando el pánico entre los clientes a punta de pistola y desatando una escena de caos. El saldo: tres personas heridas y todo un restaurante conmocionado. Crimen del taxista de Boedo: el delincuente tenía una condena a 5 años por robo, pero estaba libre Boedo: cuatro ladrones asaltaron una pizzería y golpearon a los clientes El hecho ocurrió en “Jaimito”, pizzería ubicada en México al 3400, entre Virrey Liniers y Maza, en Almagro. La estrategia de los ladrones fue ingresar por distintas puertas del local, aprovechando que estaba lleno de clientes, para sorprenderlos y atacarlos simultáneamente. La situación generó desesperación entre los presentes. Algunos entregaron sus pertenencias de inmediato, mientras que otros se escondieron debajo de las mesas, gritando por el miedo. Los delincuentes , además de robar dinero y celulares a los clientes, golpearon a aquellos que intentaban resistirse. Posteriormente, se llevaron la recaudación del local antes de darse a la fuga. Los delincuentes se dieron a la fuga El asalto quedó registrado por las cámaras de seguridad del establecimiento y el impactante video evidencia la brutalidad con la que actuaron los agresores. Tras recibir la denuncia, la Policía de la Ciudad se dirigió al lugar, pero los delincuentes ya habían escapado en un vehículo Ford Fiesta blanco por la calle México en dirección a Sánchez de Loria. Ambulancias del SAME atendieron a tres personas que presentaban lesiones en el cuero cabelludo y las trasladaron al hospital Ramos Mejía. La Fiscalía Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional N°57, a cargo del doctor Anselmo Castelli, y la Secretaría a cargo del doctor Eduardo Bossie, intervinieron en el caso. Se ordenó un relevamiento de cámaras públicas y privadas para identificar a los delincuentes y se labraron actuaciones por robo a mano armada y lesiones.",

    "text": "June 22, 1955—December 17, 2023\nRobbie Maxwell Williamson was called home in the early hours of Sunday, December 17, 2023, with her loving family by her side.\nVisitation will be Thursday, December 28, 2023, from 5:00 p.m.—8:00 p.m. and Friday, December 29, 2023, 9:00 a.m. – 11:00 a.m., with the funeral services following at 11:00 a.m. Burial following the service will be at Chippiannock Cemetery, Rock Island, IL. Services and repass will be held at Second Baptist Church Family Life Center immediately following the interment. Orr's Mortuary, Rock Island, is assisting the family with arrangements. Memorials in Robbie's name may be made to SBC Outreach Music & Arts Academy and the Second Baptist Food Pantry.\nRobbie Maxwell was born on June 22, 1955, to Henry and Vally Maxwell in Chicago, IL. Robbie was raised under the matriarch of a strong Black family where she was taught to fear the Lord, to be determined, and to persevere. Robbie was devoted to her stepfather, Sonny Hampton, and became his main caregiver until he died on January 9, 2012.\nPeople are also reading…\nAs First Lady of Second Baptist Church, Robbie did not like to be in the spotlight. As a woman of Christ, she still got a lot of work done both at Second Baptist and in the community. She loved working with the children and served as the Director of the Second Baptist Tutoring program and worked anywhere in the church that needed her. Robbie was the inventory clerk for Second Baptist Church and a member of the Usher Board, all while being a wonderful First Lady, loving wife, nurturing mother, and an extraordinary grandmother. Robbie was a longtime member of the Quad City Negro Heritage Society.\nPossessing a magnificent taste for the finer things in life, she could be relied upon for her expertise in impeccable clothing choices and other accessories—especially hats. Robbie was a connoisseur of hats. She had over 100 hats from her husband's travels all over the country as well as from friends and family. Everyone who met her loved her gentle, sweet spirit, and most importantly, a generous pure heart and beautiful smile. She could be defined as a virtuous woman. Among the things that she loved and enjoyed were cooking, gardening, dancing—especially the \"Electric Slide.\"\nLeft to cherish her memory are her loving husband, Rev. Joseph D. Williamson III; sons: Joseph D. Williamson IV, Lewisville, TX, and Charles Maxwell Williamson, Rock Island, IL; grandsons: Charles Maxwell Williamson II, and Malakai Williamson; sister, Rita Johnson; and nieces, nephews, relatives, and friends. Robbie had a special love for her Second Baptist Church Family where she will be greatly missed.\nShe was preceded in death by her parents Henry and Vally Maxwell, stepfather Sonny Hampton, and brother Charles \"Chuckie\" Maxwell.",

    "title": "Fantasy Hockey Waiver Wire: Durable Dawson Mercer is a prime roster upgrade – KIRO 7 News Seattle",
    "text": "By Evan Berofsky, RotoWire Special to Yahoo Sports Enough time has passed since you overindulged on holiday food and drinks, so there's no excuse to forget about fantasy. There's still over three months left in the NHL regular season, which means there's a lot left to play for.\nAs mentioned last week, we'll be reintroducing players who were previously covered this season who haven't recently appeared here and remain available in at least 50% of Yahoo leagues (with certain exceptions). Will any be included below? Guess you'll have to read on and find out…\n(Rostered rates as of Jan. 5)\nForwards Vladimir Tarasenko, Ottawa Senators (Yahoo: 47%) Tarasenko was brought in during the summer to complement a promising young offensive core, and for the most part he's been dependable, with eight goals, 16 assists and 66 shots in 32 games. The lack of a lead power-play role has left Tarasenko at five points, with nothing coming the last month. He's within Ottawa's top six – alongside Tim Stutzle – and remains an established sniper who can strike at any time, like the two pucks he potted Tuesday. As the Sens have been struggling, Tarasenko's name has come up in trade talks. A move to another team may hurt his potential output, though his current prospects are solid.\nJake DeBrusk, Boston Bruins (Yahoo: 41%) DeBrusk's career has generally alternated between super short-term stats and a bunch of zeroes on the scoresheet. A great start to the season was followed by a dry spell from early November to the holidays, but he's recovered to ride a five-game scoring streak consisting of three goals and four assists — with four of those points coming on the man-advantage. DeBrusk has also been mentioned as a player who could be dealt, yet that's been the case in previous years without any result. For now, he's on a nice run and is playing with a good group of forwards. That should be enough to earn additional fantasy interest.\nDawson Mercer, New Jersey Devils (Yahoo: 45%) Hard work and talent can get you far, but it sometimes takes being around the right group of people to level up. Take Mercer, a 2020 first-round pick who hasn't missed an NHL game in two-plus years. He's operated as a center, but seems to perform better as a winger alongside one of Jersey's stars. Mercer's latest situation has him next to Nico Hischier at even-strength, though he was already accomplishing enough with lesser linemates since he's produced 10 points and 17 shots from 10 contests. In the last five, he's averaged 20:16 while continuing his responsibilities in all situations. As long as the prime partnership holds, Mercer is in position to post above-average totals.\nDavid Perron, Detroit Red Wings (Yahoo: 33%) Perron has been the model of consistency the last decade with at least 41 points from nine of 10 seasons (and 36 in the other) stretching from his mid-20s to mid-30s. It's been a mixed bag this year with a few great performances, some not-so-good ones and a recent six-game suspension. When Perron is on, it's often the result of skating with the first line, and that's where he's currently positioned, though his PP status is sometimes secondary. No worries, as Perron notched a point in consecutive matchups with the man advantage. If that place beside Dylan Larkin goes away, you can always cut him loose.\nDakota Joshua, Vancouver Canucks (Yahoo: 23%) The Canucks have been one of the league's elite clubs thanks to ongoing defensive improvements and greater depth production. Their third forward trio has not-so-quietly taken on a more prominent offensive role the last month, and Joshua has become the featured player as he's been able to provide with his stick and body. Going back to Dec. 5, he's reeled off six goals, five assists, 14 shots, 11 PIM and 48 hits at over 15 minutes a night. There's no power-play job and that 23.1% shooting is bound to dip, but Joshua will do enough in multiple categories to make it worth your while.\nStefan Noesen, Carolina Hurricanes (Yahoo: 8%) Noesen received attention when he registered 36 points — with 15 PPPs — in his second season with the Canes. And despite similar low ice times, he's managed to maintain his fantasy relevance by accumulating five goals, seven assists, 20 shots, 14 PIM and 23 hits across 17 appearances. Noesen's numbers have been boosted beside Martin Necas and Jesperi Kotkaniemi and as part of Carolina's backup power play, where he holds the net-front presence. It was reported that he missed Thursday's practice due to illness, so check his status for Friday and beyond before giving him a shot.\nAnthony Mantha, Washington Capitals (Yahoo: 7%) Injuries have ruined most of Mantha's pro career as he's never really fulfilled the immense potential he carried over from the junior ranks. There were glimpses of it in Detroit and at the beginning of his days with Washington, but physical problems would end up stopping any sustained run. This has been a mainly healthy year for Mantha (knock on wood), and that's resulted in 14 points and 36 shots through the last 18 games, a period where he's been in the top six and on the second power play. Let's hope he doesn't get hurt again soon because the Caps really need all their attacking pieces around so they don't fall off from what's been a better-than-expected campaign.\nPhilipp Kurashev, Chicago Blackhawks (Yahoo: 4%) Nick Foligno was discussed last week as a perennial fantasy performer who had been gaining traction as a result of joining forces with Connor Bedard. So let's not forget about Kurashev, who's been the mainstay beside the young star. All three also participate on the Blackhawks' lead man-advantage, where Kurashev has already supplied a personal best of seven PPPs. You may also not realize he's teamed up with Chicago's savior since returning from a wrist issue near the end of October. Kurashev also comfortably ranks second in team scoring and average forward ice time (less than a minute behind Bedard). Before you rack your brain trying to figure out how he's still available in 97% of Yahoo leagues, maybe you should go out and grab him.\nDefensemen Josh Manson, Colorado Avalanche (Yahoo: 32%) Other than a 37-point effort with Anaheim back in 2017-18, Manson hasn't really been involved offensively over his 10-year career. That continued into this season as he only posted an assist from his first 19 games. December was a pretty good month for Manson as he'd go on to total four goals and six assists on top of 28 shots, a plus-10, 34 hits and 19 blocks. Don't expect the points to keep flowing, but the contributions will come elsewhere as he's securely within Colorado's top four.\nJamie Drysdale, Anaheim Ducks (Yahoo: 18%) Congrats to those who guessed Drysdale as the first column repeat! He was first featured here in the opening week and promptly missed over two months with a lower-body issue, so let's hope this latest inclusion doesn't result in a similar situation. Drysdale has jumped right back into a decent amount of ice time and a place on Anaheim's top power play, though nothing has come there yet. And in the six contests since returning, he's recorded an even-strength goal, a shorthanded assist, 12 shots and 13 blocks.\nTimothy Liljegren, Toronto Maple Leafs (Yahoo: 6%) Liljegren also had his season halted for a while after suffering an ankle injury in early November. He came back seven weeks later and has since been provided with sufficient ice time by logging an average of over 20 minutes. Liljegren has converted the extra work into five points, eight shots, 16 hits and a whopping 29 blocks across nine outings. He also maintains a spot on the point of the Leafs' fairly talented second man-advantage, where he's supplied a PPA.\nWill Borgen, Seattle Kraken (Yahoo: 3%) We bookend this section with another blueliner significantly surpassing scoring expectations. Borgen produced 20 points while appearing in all 82 games during his first full year in the NHL. Not bad, but nothing exciting. With a slightly heavier workload, Borgen is up to 14 in 38 — including eight over the last 12. That last stretch has also seen him chip in 12 shots, 26 hits and 19 blocks. Like Manson, Borgen probably won't continue to overachieve on offense. At the same time, he'll be given plenty of opportunities as a trusted defender who also skates on the penalty kill.\nGoaltenders Samuel Ersson, Philadelphia Flyers (Yahoo: 27%) Since allowing 12 goals in the first two starts, Ersson has excelled with a 2.03 GAA, .922 save percentage, and two shutouts. Carter Hart started off December with three straight wins but has since stumbled. He's also spent multiple stints on the sidelines this season, which allowed Ersson to shine. Hart should still be considered Philly's lead goalie, though Ersson will earn more work based on better overall consistency.\nNico Daws, New Jersey Devils (Yahoo: 17%) Daws lost the first two months of the season due to injury and performed well in the AHL between brief call-ups. The Devils have been horrendous on the back end throughout and clearly needed a spark in net. And so far, Daws has delivered with victories in both outings. Vitek Vanecek has put in some solid efforts of late and remains Jersey's No. 1, but Daws should pick up enough appearances on a club that boasts a top- 10 attack.\nPlayers to consider from past columns: Pavel Zacha, Seth Jarvis, Ryan O'Reilly, Troy Terry, William Karlsson, Trevor Zegras, Wyatt Johnston, Matty Beniers, Nick Schmaltz, Quinton Byfield, Sam Bennett, Owen Tippett, Josh Norris, Robert Thomas, Nazem Kadri, Mikael Granlund, Cole Perfetti, Nikolaj Ehlers, Chandler Stephenson, Adam Fantilli, Mason McTavish, Dylan Strome, Brayden Schenn, Ivan Barbashev, Charlie Coyle, Jesperi Kotkaniemi, Marco Rossi, Nick Paul, Trevor Moore, Marcus Johansson, Ryan Strome, John-Jason Peterka, Blake Coleman, Morgan Geekie, Yegor Sharangovich, Zach Benson, Sean Couturier, Eeli Tolvanen, Oliver Bjorkstrand, Kirill Marchenko, Rickard Rakell, Gabriel Vilardi, Tyson Foerster, Michael Bunting, Matias Maccelli, Alex Kerfoot, Colton Sissons, Jake Sanderson, Owen Power, Mike Matheson, Brock Faber, Filip Hronek, Torey Krug, Zach Werenski, Noah Hanifin, Oliver Ekman-Larsson, Thomas Harley, Neal Pionk, Travis Sanheim, Mattias Ekholm, Ivan Provorov, Simon Nemec, Elvis Merzlikins, Connor Ingram, Pyotr Kochetkov, Scott Wedgewood, Karel Vejmelka, Martin Jones, Petr Mrazek, Alex Lyon, Joey Daccord, Sam Montembeault, Joel Hofer",

    "text": "MADRID, 22 Feb. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl ministro del Interior de Francia, Gérald Darmanin, ha anunciado este jueves la expulsión a Túnez del imán \"radical\" Mahjub Mahjubi, que dirigía sermones desde la mezquita de Bagnols-sur-Cèze, ubicada en el departamento de Gard, en los que realizaba comentarios antisemitas, machistas e intolerantes.\n\"Esta es la demostración de que la ley de inmigración, sin la cual una expulsión tan rápida no habría sido posible, fortalece a Francia. No dejaremos pasar nada\", ha indicado Darmanin en la red social X, anteriormente conocida como Twitter.\nSegún el decreto de expulsión, el imán \"transmitía una concepción literal, retrógrada, intolerante y violenta del islam, susceptible de fomentar comportamientos contrarios a los valores\" de Francia, ha recogido la cadena francesa BFM TV.\nEntre este tipo de comportamientos, se encuentra \"la discriminación contra las mujeres\", a quienes define como \"inferiores\" y que \"deben ser guiadas y controladas por los hombres\", así como comentarios de odio contra los judíos, a quienes tilda de \"aliados del Anticristo\".\n\"Los comentarios que llaman al odio hacia los judíos e Israel y que defienden la yihad pueden incitar a seguidores a llevar a cabo un acto violento\", reza el texto, que agrega que el imán llegó a asegurar en otro de sus sermones que \"las mezquitas no crean combatientes como en la época del profeta\" Mahoma.\nMahjubi, nacido en Túnez y afincado en Francia desde 1986, está casado con una mujer de nacionalidad francesa. Sus sermones levantaron polémica después de que saliese a la luz que había calificado la bandera tricolor de \"satánica\".\nLeer más acerca de: Francia Túnez",

    "text": "There’s something seriously wrong here. When did America get to the point where one of the two major parties we allow ourselves would see fit to nominate someone like Donald Trump for president? When did that become ‘normal’ — and why only for one party? (IOKIYAR is now the law of the land.) What our news media seems unable to process is that the Republican Party is no longer a legitimate participant in the normal workings of our political process or our government. The party’s candidate for president is a twice-impeached, convicted felon, a tax cheat, a business fraud, a sexual predator, a leader more beloved by our adversaries than our allies. He is still facing serious charges for inciting mob violence, voter fraud, and stealing national secrets. A million Americans died from his incompetence during the pandemic; many more became sick. Everything he says is a lie. The media barely acknowledges it — and are completely unable to connect the dots about what that says about a political party that has no problems with any of that. Let Biden slur a word or stumble though, and they are all over that. WTF is wrong with the press and more importantly the GOP that brought us to this point? David Corn can tell you. The Republican Party has been headed towards this moment since the Eisenhower years. Corn has documented how the GOP lost its mind with his 2022 book American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy (Updated paperback edition.) At a recent Zoom conference with subscribers to his Our Land newsletter, I asked him about it: During our recent Our Land Zoom get-together, the kind-of-monthly gathering of premium subscribers to this newsletter—during which we commiserate, share stories, and kvetch about politics, the world, and other matters—one participant noted that he had recently re-read the introduction to my book American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy, which charts the long history of the Republican Party’s cozy relationship with right-wing extremism. He said he found it useful for understanding the 2024 campaign and asked if I could post that portion of the book so it could be widely shared. I am flattered that he thought these words of mine might be influential in the final months of a crucial election. I’m not sure the publisher would grant permission for such a giveaway. But there is a second-best course of action. When the book came out, Mother Jones published an essay adapted from the book that covered many of the ideas included in the introduction. That article remains available for reading and sharing here. And the updated paperback edition is still highly relevant and available wherever you find your books.

An excerpt: ...Both Pelosi and Biden have bolstered the notion that the current GOP, with its cultlike embrace of Trump and his Big Lie, and its acceptance of the fringiest players, is a break from the past. But was the GOP’s complete surrender to Trumpism an aberration? Or was the party long sliding toward this point? About a year ago, I set out to explore the history of the Republican Party, with this question in mind. What I found was not an exception, but a pattern. Since the 1950s, the GOP has repeatedly mined fear, resentment, prejudice, and grievance and played to extremist forces so the party could win elections. Trump assembling white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Christian nationalists, QAnoners, and others who formed a violent terrorist mob on January 6 is only the most flagrant manifestation of the tried-and-true GOP tactic to court kooks and bigots. It’s an ugly and shameful history that has led the Party of Lincoln, founded in 1854 to oppose the extension of slavery, to the Party of Trump, which capitalizes on racism and assaults democracy. ...Both Pelosi and Biden have bolstered the notion that the current GOP, with its cultlike embrace of Trump and his Big Lie, and its acceptance of the fringiest players, is a break from the past.

You might think the media has had plenty of time to realize how unhinged the Republican Party has become — they haven’t been hiding it. In his latest issue of Our Land, Corn recalls how crazy the 2016 Convention that nominated Trump was: When I covered the 2016 Republican convention in Cleveland, I filed several dispatches focusing on what should have been a central theme of that election year: The party had gone nuts. It was not just that a failed-casino-operator-turned-phony-reality-TV-celebrity had captured the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. The GOP had become dominated by far-right extremists pushing tribalistic grievances and irrational paranoia. During convention week, defeated presidential candidate Ben Carson compared Hillary Clinton to Lucifer. A prominent Trump supporter named Al Baldasaro declared on a radio show that Clinton deserved to “be put in the firing line and shot for treason.” A variety of delegates told me that Hillary and her husband, Bill, had achieved power by committing numerous murders (and covering up the assassination of White House aide Vince Foster). As I wrote at the time, “This is what you need to know about Donald Trump’s GOP. At the convention in Cleveland, Alex Jones, a prominent peddler of conspiracy theories, was in the hall as a special guest.” Of course, there were chants of “Lock her up!” during the official proceedings and at other events. This gathering was a clear sign that extremists motivated by assorted resentments and enthralled with political hatred were aiming to seize power. Eight years later, with the latest GOP convention due to open in Milwaukee in three weeks, the Republican Party has become even more Trumpified and crazier. That’s obvious from its embrace of Trump’s Big Lie and its fervent support of a felon who tried to overturn the 2020 election and who incited an insurrectionist assault on the US Capitol. And in recent days, we’ve seen the extremism virus continue to spread unimpeded throughout the Republican Party.

And in recent days, we’ve seen the extremism virus continue to spread unimpeded throughout the Republican Party. The only reason Trump will be able to take the stage tonight is because of the inability — if not outright refusal — of the media and too many of our fellow citizens to see what is happening right before our eyes. And before anyone jumps in to say Democrats should be talking about this loud and clear, keep in mind several things. Some of them are, but... Republicans have spent decades portraying the Democratic Party as the one that is extreme, corrupt, and out of control. They have an extensive media apparatus of their own catapulting the propaganda 24/7 — and Democrats don’t. They’ve spent decades ‘working the refs’ with their accusations of “liberal media bias” to the point where the media dares not call them out on their crazy. Remember when Biden tried to talk about just how extreme the GOP has become — and how the media dismissed it as too divisive, too over the top? How so many people dismissed it as an empty ‘both-sides’ thing? Republicans have spent years moving the Overton Window ever more to the right. It takes an examination of the long term as Corn has done in American Psychosis to be able to appreciate how long the frog has been boiling, to use an analogy. The question is, have we finally reached the point where what the Republican Party has become is too obvious to ignore? The Dobbs decision from the Republican Supreme Court got some attention; the latest ruling allowing anyone to buy a bumpstock so they can turn firearms into machine guns will be another wakeup call the next time someone uses one in a mass shooting. The extreme anti-abortion laws, anti LGBTQ Trans laws, the bans on talking about climate change, synthetic meat, and attacks on wind turbines and electric cars — the flood of crazy coming out of Red States is getting hard to brush off. Look again at the picture at the top of this page. How is it we’ve shoved that down the memory hole while the party who made it happen is staging a comeback? They’re not hiding it. Will it be on stage tonight, and will anyone see it if is? Find time to look at Corn’s piece in Mother Jones and get the book if you want to understand how we got here. The crazy isn’t going to go away with Trump — it will still be around long after him. We need to recognize it and deal with it. Fingers crossed over the debate...",
