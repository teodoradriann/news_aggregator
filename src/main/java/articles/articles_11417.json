But the rest went ok.,\nThen I waited for the box to reappear in the LAN, and soon after, the ping was working again.\nSSH worked too, but NO WEBINTERFACE\n(and of course, all the unraid stuff has not been started too)\nI looked for \"emhttpd\", but even \"which\" told me, there was none on the stick anymore!\nSo, what to launch???\nI reverted to the old 6.12.14 just by copying \"previous\" to \"/\" and rebooting. Reboot got stuck again... had to use the reset switch!\n6.12.14 came back up fine again, not even a parity check was needed! Fine.\nSo once more trying to update... this time without a stuck file.\nUpdate went ok, rebooting... NO GUI! again.\nSame procedure as before, no emhttp, no unraid started. just a minimal linux. (this time again I was in the garage, dispite the cold)\nReverted to 6.12.14 again, giving up on 7!\nI have a 7 beta box (fresh install) which works fine, but updating a real one obviously does not work!\nSo, what am I missing (or what did the update forgot to change? \"emhttpd\" now elsewhere, renamed, whatever???)",

    "text": "Shandong is harnessing the power of outdoor sports to revitalize its rural areas. By transforming its abundant natural and cultural resources into outdoor recreation destinations, Shandong is attracting visitors, creating jobs, and boosting local economies.\nShima town, Zibo, a prime example of this transformation, once struggled to attract attention despite its stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. However, by embracing outdoor sports, the town has become a popular destination for hiking, cycling, and other activities. The Wuyang Lake Sports and Culture Park receives over 300,000 visitors annually and provides jobs for over 200 rural residents.\nRecognizing the potential of outdoor sports, Shandong has launched initiatives to support and develop the sector across the region. A sports carnival kicked off in Shima Town on June 29, featuring diverse competitions, including a swimming race, a climbing competition, and a kayaking show.\nAthletes sprint fiercely in a marathon held as part of the sports carnival. [Photo/WeChat account: shandongshengtiyuju]\nThe success of events like the 2023 World Triathlon Cup held in Weihai last year further demonstrates the economic impact of outdoor sports. The event generated 47 million yuan ($6.46 million) in direct economic benefits and a quantifiable brand value exceeding 400 million yuan.\nShandong plans to develop rural characteristic outdoor sports industries such as mountaineering, cycling, water sports, air sports, and camping. It will also cultivate and create rural characteristic outdoor sports consumption scenarios, deepen the integration of sports with various industries, and aid in rural vitalization.\n来源：chinadaily.com.cn 编辑：孔垂頔 责编：宋基金 主编：韩信",

    "text": "Wolfspeed will be taken over by creditors including Apollo Global Management under a proposal that would put the struggling chipmaker into bankruptcy, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the plan.\nThe company will soon announce a deal for a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy, that would be long enough to slash billions in debt, the report said. After a restructuring support agreement is signed, Wolfspeed will ask creditors to vote on the plan and then file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nShares of Wolfspeed, which makes chips using silicon carbide — a more energy-efficient material than traditional silicon, rose about 3% to $1.29 on Wednesday. The stock had fallen about 81% so far this year.\nWolfspeed and Apollo did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nThe chipmaker raised going-concern doubts earlier in May, as deepening economic uncertainty stemming from changing U.S. trade policies, combined with weakening demand, triggered a series of financial challenges for the company.\nAs of March, the company had about $1.33 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and about $6.5 billion of debt obligations, it said in a regulatory filing in May.\nIn a prepackaged bankruptcy, companies and their creditors agree on a reorganization plan prior to the bankruptcy filing and creditors even vote on the plan.\nShareholders could recover as much as 5% in the proposed scenario, the report said. In a typical bankruptcy, shareholders are usually wiped out because creditors must be paid first, and there often is not enough value left for equity holders.\nIn 2023, Wolfspeed announced $1.25 billion in debt financing led by Apollo, with the option to increase the total to as much as $2 billion to support the company’s U.S. expansion plans.

Mercury has begun to plummet with minimum night temperature falling below the normal in several regions.\nDespite the late onset, the chilling cold is gradually intensifying. In the coming days, temperatures in interior districts could reach as low as 9 degrees Celsius. Moreover, urban areas are also expected to see the mercury dip below 15 degrees Celsius.\nThe\nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that temperatures will remain relatively stable over the next week, with predominantly dry conditions likely. The IMD has also forecast an increase in fog across various parts of the state over the next two days.\nAlso Read:\nOdisha braces for cold wave as mercury to dip further by 2-4 degree Celsius\nFor today, various districts, including Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, Bargarh, Ganjam, Kandhamal, Kalahandi, and Koraput, are anticipated to experience mild to moderate fog, according to the IMD.

It is caused by a poxvirus and results in skin lesions that usually resolve within a year without scarring, but can take a lot longer in some cases.\nThe drug will compete with Verrica Pharmaceuticals' Ycanth, which last year became the first U.S.-approved treatment for the infection, but requires medical supervision during application.

The city requires 2,600 MLD of water, out of which 1,470 MLD is sourced from the Cauvery River and 650 MLD from borewells, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah had told reporters.\nSeveral other states, including Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (two combined projects in both states), and Tamil Nadu, also reported lower storage levels compared to last year.\nThe total live storage capacity of these 150 reservoirs is 178.784 BCM, which accounts for about 69.35 per cent of the nation’s total live storage capacity estimated at 257.812 billion cubic metres, according to official data.\nAccording to the reservoir storage bulletin Thursday, the live storage available in these reservoirs is 67.591 BCM, representing 38 per cent of their total live storage capacity.\nHowever, during the corresponding period last year, the live storage available was 80.557 BCM, with an average of 72.396 BCM over the past decade.\nThus, the current live storage in these 150 reservoirs amounts to 84 per cent of the storage during the same period last year and 93 per cent of the average storage over the past decade.\n“The overall storage position in the country is lower than the corresponding period last year and also falls short of the average storage over the past ten years for the same period,” stated the bulletin.\nThe Southern region, which includes states like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (two combined projects in both states), Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, monitors 42 reservoirs with a total live storage capacity of 53.334 BCM.\nAs of the Reservoir Storage Bulletin dated 21.03.2024, the total live storage available in these reservoirs is 12.287 BCM, which constitutes 23 per cent of their total live storage capacity.\nThis marks a decrease compared to the storage levels during the corresponding period last year (39 per cent) and the average storage over the past ten years (32 per cent).\nThus, the current storage levels in the Southern region are lower than those observed during the same period last year and also fall below the average storage over the past ten years.\nPTI",

    "text": "INO, Japan (Reuters) - Over the last decade, Masato Shiota brought his papermaking business back from the brink, paying down debt and buying machinery to automate some production. But he struggles to find workers to keep output at full capacity.\n\"We have three machines but only have two running on any day,\" said Shiota, president of Wako Seishi, which produces tissues, disinfectant wipes and toilet paper in Ino, a town on the smallest of Japan's four main islands known for its paper industry.\n\"If we don't have the people we can't make products and we can't turn a profit. We'll go under. This is the biggest problem for small and medium-sized companies.\"\nShiota's experiences and those of several other Ino business owners show how a labour shortage is a growing threat to smaller companies that provide seven out of every 10 jobs in Japan. The country faces a deficit of 3.4 million workers by the end of this decade and 11 million by 2040, according to a 2023 study by Recruit Works Institute.\nIn the first half of this year, a record 182 companies went under because of worker shortages, according to research firm Teikoku Databank, up 66% on a year earlier. Overall bankruptcies look set to surpass 10,000 this year, the highest since 2013, data from Tokyo Shoko Research showed this month.\nWhile labour shortage-related bankruptcies are a small portion of the total, the surge will ripple through to these companies' suppliers and customers, potentially causing a \"chain of bankruptcies or mergers\", according to Takayasu Otomo, a researcher at Teikoku Databank.\nJapan in March raised borrowing costs for the first time in 17 years, signalling the world's fourth-largest economy had turned a corner after years of stagnation.\nYet Reuters interviews with 16 people, including business leaders in Ino, industry experts and officials, reveal challenges for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's efforts to revitalise rural economies facing ageing and shrinking populations.\nWhile Japan is allowing more underperforming businesses to fail, the accounts suggest the worker shortage is threatening firms that are otherwise robust, including those that have invested in automation and creative hiring.\nJapan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry did not respond to questions about the experiences of business owners in Ino.\n'ECONOMIC METABOLISM'\nShiota, who also heads the local papermaking association, has 42 employees and saw demand for disinfectant wipes surge during the pandemic.\nHe has cut out unprofitable products and, with government support, invested 80 million yen ($520,000) to automate his lines. But Shiota said he has little ability to pay workers more beyond a recent increase in the minimum wage, which will rise again next year.\nJapan remains resistant to large-scale immigration, so some companies have plugged labour gaps by employing short-term workers from Vietnam and other Asian countries. But a weakening yen makes it harder to attract foreign workers.\nSome Japanese officials see bankruptcies triggered by labour shortages as an inevitable effect of what they call \"economic metabolism\" - whereby less-dynamic companies are swept away, allowing workers and capital to migrate to more productive ones.\nWhen asked about the rise in these bankruptcies, one senior official, granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said it was \"natural\" for such economic metabolism to take place.\nThe bankruptcy rate remains low compared with some countries, the official said, adding that if such bankruptcies did not occur, workers would be stuck at low-wage companies.\nLEARNING TO ADAPT\nNestled alongside the Niyodo river, Ino is known for traditional products such as \"Tosa washi\" paper, made by hand for 1,000 years and used in calligraphy and on \"shoji\" sliding doors.\nGiven its population of 20,000 and location off the beaten track, Ino's papermakers have carved out niches to survive. Toyo Tokushi, owned by the Moriki family, diversified into adult diapers in 1970, which now account for 70% of sales.\nFaced with a staffing crunch, the company for the first time is considering hiring graduates straight out of high school, said Kei Moriki, the 32-year-old director.\nEven so, he said he isn't sure that the company can muster the resources to train employees with no work experience.\nOld trophies from an annual softball tournament held by the local paper manufacturers association adorn the company headquarters. Toyo Tokushi hasn't fielded a team in around 20 years, Moriki said, as his workforce has aged.\nElsewhere in Ino, there are few izakaya pubs left and only one fish shop, down from a dozen in 2007, according to locals.\nIshiba has given few details about how he plans to revitalise rural areas, but has promised to lay out a plan by early next year to raise the minimum wage by 42% by the end of the decade.\nMeanwhile, the government is on a push to help small and medium-sized enterprises raise prices so they can hike wages that lag the OECD average. Higher wages would also help smaller companies attract workers.\nBut in Ino, business owners say it's not straightforward.\nKashiki Seishi, a maker of washi paper, used to source everything from local farmers, according to chief executive Hiromasa Hamada. But since 2017 the six-person company has also depended on volunteers from a programme that allows people to work on farms in exchange for room and board.\n\"I don't think it's healthy for a business to rely on volunteers,\" said the 44-year-old Hamada, a seventh-generation papermaker.\nBut he appears to have little choice, as there are fewer farmers in the nearby ranges to collect wood and other materials he needs.\nIn 10 years, he said, \"there might be no one left in the mountains\".\n(Reporting by Anton Bridge and Makiko Yamazaki; Additional reporting by Ritsuko Shimizu; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by David Crawshaw.)\nBy Anton Bridge and Makiko Yamazaki\nShare © Reuters - 2024",
