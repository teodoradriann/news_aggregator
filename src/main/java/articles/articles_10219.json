    "text": "AAT Kings Group Unveils Loyalty Program as Bali Abandons Proposed Entertainment Tax\nSouth Korea Probes Alleged Tech Theft of KF-21 Fighter Jet by Indonesian Engineers\nSouth Korean authorities have instigated an investigation into a group of Indonesian engineers under suspicion of stealing technology related to the development of the KF-21 fighter jet. The engineers, employed at Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), caused alarm when it was discovered they may have stored sensitive data regarding the jet’s development on a USB drive.\nThe Investigation\nThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Defense Counterintelligence Command have taken the helm in this probe, drawing support from the National Intelligence Service. The Indonesian engineers are currently prohibited from leaving South Korea, as the investigation is ongoing and seeks to determine if the data includes strategic technologies.\nIndonesia’s Role in the KF-21 Project\nIndonesia is partnered in the development of the KF-21 project but has been lagging in its financial commitments. It has contributed only 278.3 billion won of its promised 20 percent share of the 8.8 trillion won total cost. This financial shortfall, coupled with the alleged theft of technology, is casting a shadow over the partnership.\nSouth Korea’s Ambitious Fighter Jet Program\nDespite these setbacks, South Korea is steadfast in its plan to produce the KF-21 fighter jets. The nation is intent on deploying 120 units by 2032, marking a significant step in its military aviation ambitions. The KF-21 is a symbol of South Korea’s technological prowess, and any compromise of its intellectual property is seen as a threat to the country’s strategic interests.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/world/chitungwiza-municipality-launches-verification-process-for-land-stand-offer-letters-amid-fraud-concerns/",

    "text": "People wanting to study in US universities will now have to make their social media accounts available for vetting, in a bid to identify any applicants who may be 'hostile'.\nAccording to an internal State Department cable reviewed by Reuters, US consular officers will be required to conduct a \"comprehensive and thorough vetting\" of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who \"bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.\"\nThe cable, dated June 18 was sent to US missions on Wednesday.\nOn May 27, the Trump administration ordered its missions abroad to stop scheduling new appointments for student and exchange visitor visa applicants.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said updated guidance would be released once a review was completed.\nThe June 18 dated cable, which was sent by Rubio and sent to all US diplomatic missions, directed officers to look for \"applicants who demonstrate a history of political activism, especially when it is associated with violence or with the views and activities described above, you must consider the likelihood they would continue such activity in the United States.\"\nThe cable authorised the consular officers to ask the applicants to make all of their social media accounts public.\n\"Remind the applicant that limited access to....online presence could be construed as an effort to evade or hide certain activity,\" the cable said.\nThe move follows the administration's enhanced vetting measures last month for visa applicants looking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose, in what a separate State Department cable said would serve as a pilot program for wider expanded screening.\nDuring the vetting, the directive asks officers to look for any potentially derogatory information about the applicant.\n\"For example, during an online presence search, you might discover on social media that an applicant endorsed Hamas or its activities,\" the cable says, adding that may be a reason for ineligibility.\nRubio, Trump's top diplomat and national security adviser, has said he's revoked the visas of hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, including students, because they got involved in activities that 'went against' US foreign policy priorities.\nThose activities include support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza.\nA Tufts University student from Turkey was held for over six weeks in an immigration detention centre in Louisiana after co-writing an opinion piece criticising her school's response to Israel's war in Gaza. She was released from custody after a federal judge granted her bail.\nTrump's critics have said the administration's actions are an attack on free speech rights under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.\nWhile the new directive allows posts to resume scheduling for student and exchange visa applicants, it is warning the officers that there may have to be fewer appointments due to the demands of more extensive vetting.\nAt Harvard, the oldest and wealthiest US university on which the administration has launched a multifront attack by freezing its billions of dollars of grants and other funding, foreign students last year made up about 27 per cent of the total student population.",

    "text": "Waco teen sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2021 shooting death WACO, Texas (KWTX) - An 18-year-old Waco teen, one of four defendants charged with capital murder in the 2021 shooting death and robbery of a man who was lured to South Waco through a fake social media account, was sentenced to 30 years in prison Thursday. Edgar Alfonso Castillo pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of murder in exchange for a recommendation from the McLennan County District Attorney’s Office that he serve 30 years in prison in the September shooting death of 22-year-old Israel Martinez. Judge Susan Kelly of Waco’s 54th State District Court approved the plea agreement and sentenced Castillo in accordance with the plea bargain. Castillo, who was 16 at the time of the offense, must serve at least 15 years in prison before he can seek parole. He will be given credit for the 618 days he spent in custody waiting for his case to be resolved. Castillo’s attorney, Jonathan Sibley said Castillo has taken responsibility for his role in the incident. “Obviously, when a case involves a tragic death, you understand the loss the victim’s family must be feeling,” Sibley said. “In this case, Mr. Castillo was a minor at the time of the incident, and this is every parent’s nightmare when their child gets involved with a group of boys who make decisions that will affect the rest of all of their lives.” “I know Mr. Castillo’s family loves him and will certainly feel and be affected severely by his absence while he serves his sentence in this case.” Assistant District Attorney Kristi DeCluitt declined comment Thursday because the other cases remain pending. Two other juveniles who also have been certified to stand trial as adults, Cyle Flores, 16, and Jeremiah Marquez, 18, also are charged with capital murder in the death of Martinez, an insulation company worker and the father of a young son. Waco police say the teens worked with Justin Angel Hernandez, 22, to use Facebook Messenger to lure Martinez to a home in the 2200 block of Gurley Avenue. Hernandez also was indicted on a capital murder charge. The charges remain pending against the other three defendants. According to arrest records in Hernandez’s case, Martinez was shot multiple times in front of a home on Gurley Lane that had been broken into through a back window. Police reported finding spent shell casings from a number of different types of firearms at the scene. Witnesses saw multiple people flee the scene. Officers found Martinez’s wallet, cell phone and other items near his body, police said. After examining his phone, investigators said his Facebook account showed he had been communicating with a woman named Kaelani Moore on Facebook Messenger. A photo that purported to be Moore’s was on the phone, along with a message telling Martinez to come to 2212 Gurley Ave., according to an arrest warrant affidavit. The message described a vehicle that would be parked in front of the house. Officers later discovered that the Facebook account was deleted or deactivated, the affidavit states. Detectives found the conversation Martinez was led to believe was with the woman came from Hernandez’s Facebook account, the affidavit alleges. Hernandez directed Martinez to send money to a money transfer application with the screen name “Kaelani M,” the reports state. Waco police allege in the affidavit that the account associated with the email address on the Kaelani Moore Facebook account was used to “set up the murder victim.” The subscriber name on the account came back to Hernandez, the affidavit alleges. Martinez is the brother of 24-year-old Valarie Martinez, who was found shot to death at Tradinghouse Creek Reservoir park along with her 1-year-old daughter, Azariah, in November 2017. Christopher Paul Weiss was convicted of capital murder after an April trial in Waco’s 19th State District Court and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Copyright 2024 KWTX.

Questo fenomeno meteorologico, di origine sub-tropicale, porterà temperature elevate e condizioni climatiche anomale. L'anticiclone Caronte, proveniente dal deserto del Sahara, porterà un aumento significativo delle temperature in tutta Italia. Le masse d'aria calda, unite al sole intenso, faranno salire i valori termici a livelli estremi. Secondo le previsioni, questa nuova fase di caldo intenso durerà per diversi giorni, con picchi di temperatura che potrebbero superare i 40 gradi in alcune regioni. L'ondata di caldo di luglio 2024 ha evidenziato gli effetti tangibili del cambiamento climatico indotto dall'uomo. Secondo uno studio del World Weather Attribution, le temperature raggiunte sarebbero state praticamente impossibili senza il riscaldamento globale causato dalla combustione di combustibili fossili. Questo fenomeno mette in luce la necessità di adottare misure urgenti per contrastare il cambiamento climatico e ridurre le emissioni di gas serra. A Firenze, l'allerta da bollino rosso è stata estesa fino a domani, venerdì 2 agosto. Questo significa che la città ha registrato temperature superiori ai 35 gradi per 18 giorni consecutivi. Il bollettino elaborato dal dipartimento di epidemiologia SSR Regione Lazio, nell'ambito del sistema operativo nazionale di previsione e prevenzione degli effetti del caldo, ha evidenziato l'importanza di adottare comportamenti e misure di prevenzione per ridurre le conseguenze nocive delle ondate di calore. Per affrontare al meglio questa nuova ondata di caldo, è fondamentale seguire alcune semplici misure di prevenzione. Bere molta acqua, evitare l'esposizione diretta al sole nelle ore più calde della giornata e indossare abiti leggeri e traspiranti sono solo alcune delle raccomandazioni per proteggersi dalle alte temperature. Inoltre, è importante prestare particolare attenzione alle persone più vulnerabili, come anziani e bambini, che sono maggiormente a rischio di colpi di calore e disidratazione.",

This surge has been driven by various factors, including robust economic growth and a young, affluent demographic with an appetite for luxury goods and innovative investment opportunities. This trend is particularly significant for HNWIs in the region, who are not only consumers of luxury goods but also open to diversifying their investments to include new and exclusive assets in their portfolios. As a result, the luxury market in Asia is not only expanding but also evolving, with new technologies and investment strategies emerging to meet the sophisticated demands of this affluent consumer base. Tokenization of What? At the intersection of this growing wealth and an evolving luxury market lies one innovative concept built on blockchain technology: the tokenization of luxury goods. Tokenization involves creating digital representations of physical assets, such as jewelry, watches, or fine wine, thereby allowing these assets to be divided into smaller, more accessible fractions. Asset tokenization is projected to become a $10 trillion asset market by 2030, and this process is opening up new investment opportunities for HNWI in Asia as well as enhancing liquidity and transparency in the market. Traditionally, luxury assets have been illiquid investments, often taking months or years to sell. But tokenization means that investors can now trade their shares of a given asset quickly and efficiently on digital exchanges, and respond swiftly to market dynamics. The underlying blockchain technology ensures that each asset's provenance is meticulously recorded and verified, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities and enhancing investor confidence. This technological advance is reshaping how luxury goods are perceived and traded, offering a modern solution to challenges in asset ownership. Luxury Goods for Luxury Lovers Tokenized luxury assets can be traded on digital exchanges, providing increased liquidity and flexibility for investors. This ease of trading is appealing in a market where traditional luxury goods often suffer from illiquidity. Digital platforms facilitate global access, connecting buyers and sellers across borders and time zones. This enhanced liquidity transforms luxury goods from static holdings into dynamic components of an investment portfolio. Tokenized luxury goods offer HNWIs the opportunity to diversify their portfolios with investments that are less correlated with traditional financial markets. By incorporating tokenized luxury goods into their investment strategies, HNWIs can capitalize on the unique value propositions of rare and exclusive items. And with this new ability to invest easily in a diverse range of tangible asset classes, investors can tailor their portfolios according to their individual tastes. However, the benefits extend beyond investment opportunities. Tokenization also addresses one of the luxury market's persistent challenges: authenticity. Each tokenized asset comes with an immutable digital record verifying its origin, ownership history, and authenticity. This transparency builds trust among investors and consumers alike, which is particularly crucial in a region where counterfeit luxury goods have long been a concern. A Gateway to Prestige Assets Tokenized luxury goods align perfectly with the digital-first mindset prevalent among many Asian HNWI investors, offering them the chance to participate in the global luxury market with unprecedented ease and flexibility. For instance, an investor in Singapore could own a fraction of a rare vintage car stored in Switzerland or a share in a limited-edition watch collection housed in California, all without leaving a single digital platform. This global access, combined with the transparency and security offered by blockchain technology, makes tokenized luxury goods an attractive proposition for discerning HNWIs in Asia as they look to expand their investment horizons. Beyond mere ownership, owning a fraction of luxury goods enables investors to rebalance their portfolios with greater agility, selling or acquiring specific percentages of assets as market conditions change. The digital nature of these tokens allows for the creation of secondary markets, where investors can trade their luxury asset shares 24/7, potentially increasing the overall market efficiency and price discovery mechanisms. As this ecosystem matures, we may see the emergence of new financial products, such as luxury goods index funds. Stability and Trust through Regulation While tokenization offers unprecedented access and flexibility, it also brings forth a new set of challenges and complexities that require careful navigation. As the market for tokenization evolves, thoughtful regulation emerges, becoming a crucial step toward ensuring long-term viability. Regulatory frameworks will play a pivotal role in addressing key concerns such as asset authenticity, investor protection, and market stability. By establishing clear guidelines and standards, regulation will help create a more secure and reliable environment for both investors and luxury goods platforms. For instance, blockchain-based provenance tracking can be standardized to combat counterfeit luxury items, while regulatory oversight can ensure proper valuation methods for fractional ownership. These measures will not only protect investors but also enhance the overall credibility of tokenized luxury goods as an asset class. As we embrace these changes, regulatory frameworks will amplify trust in tokenized luxury goods, fostering greater participation of investors. Luxury Goods on Blockchain The tokenization of luxury goods represents a paradigm shift in how we perceive, trade, and invest in high-value assets. For Asia's HNWIs, it offers a compelling blend of tradition and innovation: the timeless appeal of luxury combined with cutting-edge technology. As this market matures, we can expect to see more sophisticated offerings and potentially even the emergence of new asset classes tailored to the preferences of Asian investors. But the overall message for HNWIs in Asia is clear: the tokenization of luxury goods represents a new frontier in investment and consumption. Those who embrace this technology early stand to gain from increased portfolio diversification, enhanced liquidity, and access to previously intangible luxury assets.",

    "text": "El temporal precipita las cancelaciones de última hora en los hoteles de Huelva durante el puente de Tosantos\nLa DANA alimenta la incertidumbre de un sector turístico que considera que se 'ha perdido' el puente, \"aunque conservamos muchas de las reservas del fin de semana\"\nRecomendaciones ante el aviso naranja por lluvias y tormentas este viernes en Huelva\nIncertidumbre ante el puente de Tosantos en el sector turístico de Huelva. Las lluvias que arrastra consigo la DANA que azota la provincia desde las últimas horas redunda en cancelaciones de última hora, sobre todo, para los días jueves y viernes. No obstante, según sostiene a este diario la presidenta de la Asociación de Empresas Turísticas de la Sierra -enmarcada en la Federación Onubense de Empresarios, FOE-, Cinta Aguilar, \"las reservas del fin de semana se mantienen\", por lo que \"hemos 'perdido' el puente y nos vamos a limitar, sobre todo, al fin de semana\", añade.\nLa Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche es uno de los destinos más apropiados para el otoño en la provincia de Huelva y, por ello, desde la Asociación de Empresas Turísticas de la Sierra tenían una previsión del 80% de ocupación, \"un porcentaje que ha caído, aunque no podemos dar una cifra concreta hasta este mismo fin de semana\", sostiene Aguilar, quien manifiesta la \"preocupación\" del sector ante las previsiones de lluvia, que alimentan \"una posición más conservadora de los clientes\". Eso sí, prosigue, \"en la Sierra llueve, pero no de forma tan intensa como en otros puntos de la provincia de Huelva, por lo que no es un destino peligroso a la hora de desplazarse por carretera\", puntualiza la presidenta.\nCabe recordar al respecto que la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha activado para este viernes los avisos naranja en el litoral, Andévalo y Condado, mientras que en la Sierra permanecerá en amarillo. Pronósticos -estos últimos con aviso naranja- que desfavorecen el turismo durante el Puente y que, a buen seguro, reducirán los porcentajes de ocupación que manejaban desde la FOE para estos días. Así, estaba previsto un 65% de ocupación en la Costa Oriental, un 75% en El Rocío -a partir del día 1-, un 80% en la Costa Occidental y un 70% en la capital. No obstante, como subrayó Cinta Aguilar, las cancelaciones de última hora reducirán estos porcentajes, aunque aún es pronto para saber hasta cuánto.\nDesde la Asociación Provincial de Hoteles de Huelva (Aphh), miembro del Círculo Empresarial de Turismo (CETH), también se pronunciaron este jueves respecto al puente de Tosantos, cifrando en un 30% las cancelaciones de reserva en los establecimientos adheridos a la misma. Esperan así, \"y siendo optimistas\", que la oferta de alojamientos turísticos de la provincia tenga finalmente una ocupación de un 30%.\nLa Aphh presentaba a finales de septiembre unas previsiones de ocupación para octubre que se situaba en un 56,02% con carácter general, sin contar con los establecimientos enfocados al segmento sénior y al segmento golf que a finales de setiembre ya contaban con ocupaciones que se situaban en el 81,46% de las plazas dirigidas a esos segmentos. Al respecto, han mantenido ya en otras ocasiones que las pernoctaciones generadas en los puentes, \"si bien suman y son positivas a la hora de concretar el resultado del ejercicio, en el cómputo anual no son suficientemente sustanciales y determinantes\".\nA este respecto, es importante resaltar que la comparativa con respecto a 2023 no procede, dado que el 1 de noviembre fue miércoles y, por ende, aquel puente fue inexistente.\nTambién te puede interesar\nLo último\nHistorias del fandango\nLa Iglesia y el fandango\nEl mundo de ayer\nRafael Castaño\nUn millón\n¡Oh, Fabio!\nLuis Sánchez-Moliní\nLa despedida de don Amadeo\nContenido patrocinado por Coolroms Palacio de Villapanés & Nissan",

    "text": "\"Usually it's young people who aren't aware of how bad things can get, and then it's the parents who can then end up in debts of millions for the sabotage,\" says security guard Lars Lindell. Reduction of unauthorised fireworks shooting The City of Helsingborg has seen a decrease since the municipality introduced the double-staffed resource a few years ago. \"The problem is still big because it violates the regulations, but I still think I see a trend in fewer sales outlets in the Helsingborg region,\" says Christian Orsing (M), chairman of the municipal board. Lasse Lindell shares this view, but adds that there may also be other factors that play a role in the fact that it has decreased. \"It may be due to the pandemic, the economy and other things, but it feels safe that we are doing this,\" says Lars Lindell. Consequences of fireworks shooting Lasse Lindell sees several disadvantages with fireworks shooting, such as personal injuries, damage to buildings and that it can scare residents. \"There are those who have fled war and who are terrified by the sound of rockets,\" he says.
