    "title": "Northern lights appear in Minnesota amid 'severe' geomagnetic storm: Photos | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul",
    "text": "article MINNEAPOLIS (FOX 9) - The northern lights lit up the sky in Minnesota Thursday night as a \"severe\" geomagnetic storm is underway.\nBackground NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) issued a severe (G4) geomagnetic storm alert lasting through Friday, setting the stage for the northern lights to appear across Minnesota. Although the northern lights are typically visible in polar regions, more intense solar events can cause the aurora borealis to appear farther south.\nSWPC rates solar storms on a five-level scale, with G5 being extreme conditions. It also uses the planetary K index, or Kp, to indicate the level of geomagnetic activity.\nOn Thursday night, the Kp reached a peak of 8.4, with the SWPC describing northern lights in the 8 to 9 Kp range as becoming \"very bright and very active,\" adding that \"these are the events that create the best aurora,\" the website read in part.\nThe alert was just one of several recent geomagnetic storms that helped set the stage for the possibility of seeing the northern lights. The aurora borealis was spotted in Minnesota on Monday after a G3 geomagnetic storm alert was issued.\nIf you missed the northern lights on Thursday, there’s a chance to see them again on Friday night. For the latest aurora forecast, visit NOAA’s website here .\nNorthern lights photos The northern lights were reported in several states from Thursday night into Friday morning, with spectacular colors dancing across Minnesota skies. People submitted pictures from around the Twin Cities and across the state, showcasing the pinks and greens of the aurora borealis.\nHave photos of the northern lights? Submit them to fox9.com/photos .\nTips for viewing the northern lights NOAA recommends the following tips for the best chance to see the northern lights.\nGo north or away from the cities. Go to areas with less light pollution. This map can help you find the best spots near you. Often, the best times to see the aurora are two hours around midnight, so from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. The spring and fall are often the best times to see the aurora, because \"the subtleties in the way the solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetosphere\" can create larger geomagnetic storms.

Foto Rubicela Morelos / archivo\nUn balacera registrada en una tienda “Del Sol” ubicada en plena zona centro, dejó como saldo a un hombre muerto y tres mujeres lesionadas.\nDe acuerdo a versiones de testigos, sujetos armados perseguían a un hombre quien intentó esconderse en el interior de dicha tienda, la cual se ubica a unos metros de la Presidencia Municipal, pero éstos no se detuvieron y sin más dispararon, hiriendo a personas que realizaban compras para los festejos de fin de año, para luego darse a la fuga.\nDe manera inmediata se alertó al servicio de emergencias 911 para alertarlos y pedir ayuda para las personas lesionadas, mientras que en el exterior del establecimiento la gente corría atemorizada y con crisis de pánico ante la balacera.\nAl lugar llegaron elementos de seguridad de los tres órdenes de gobierno, quienes acordonaron el sitio para asegurar los indicios balísticos por parte de la Fiscalía General de Guanajuato.\nEn tanto, paramédicos de cuerpos de emergencia trasladaron a las 4 personas heridas; el hombre murió cuando recibía atención médica, en tanto, una mujer no requirió de hospitalización pues sufrió heridas leves.\nLa Secretaría de Seguridad Ciudadana de Irapuato confirmó el hecho y señaló que pese a que se montó un operativo especial de seguridad no se logró dar con los responsables de dicho ataque armado, y refrendó su disposición por coadyuvar con la Fiscalía de Guanajuato para dar con los responsables.",

    "text": "The war in Gaza featured prominently in Monday's Pulitzer Prizes, which included a special citation for journalists covering the Israel-Hamas conflict.The New York Times won a Pulitzer in international reporting for its \"wide-ranging and revelatory coverage of Hamas's lethal attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7,\" as well as reporting on \"the Israeli military's sweeping, deadly response.\"Reuters meanwhile won the award for breaking news photography for its \"raw and urgent\" coverage of the October 7 attack and Israeli response, while a special citation recognized \"journalists and media workers covering the war in Gaza.\"\"This war has also claimed the lives of poets and writers,\" the committee said. \"As the Pulitzer Prizes honor categories of journalism, arts and letters, we mark the loss of invaluable records of the human experience.\"The prize also recognized jailed Russian opposition politician and Washington Post contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza \"for passionate columns written at great person risk from his prison cell warning of the consequences of dissent in Vladimir Putin's Russia and insisting for a democratic future for his country.\"Kara-Murza is serving a 25-year jail sentence in Russia, the longest known sentence of all of President Vladimir Putin's jailed critics, on charges of \"treason\" after using a speech in the United States to say Russia had committed \"war crimes\" against Ukraine.The awards, given out at Columbia University, come as the New York college has faced backlash after it called in police to clear out pro-Palestinian protesters. The police largely blocked media from the scene and threatened student journalists covering the events with arrest.Two of Columbia's student newspaper editors outlined in an article over the weekend the university's \"suppression\" of its reporting, including arrest threats from police and demands from the university to hand over videos and photos.Other awards honored US journalists' reporting on migrant child labor, racial disparities in the legal system and gun violence.Author Jayne Anne Phillips won the fiction prize for her novel \"Night Watch,\" about a mother and daughter during and after the US Civil War, while the nonfiction prize went to Nathan Thrall's \"A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy.\"The committee praised the \"finely reported and intimate account of life under Israeli occupation of the West Bank, told through the portrait of a Palestinian father whose five-year-old son dies in a fiery school bus crash when Israeli and Palestinian rescue teams are delayed by security regulations.\"© ",
