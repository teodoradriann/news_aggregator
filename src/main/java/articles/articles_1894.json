    "title": "Our ancient ancestors cut off their fingers to worship prehistoric deities, study finds",
    "text": "Say what you want about the body modification trends of the 21st century , but our prehistoric ancestors did a number to their digits. Men and women of the Palaeolithic era in Western Europe may have chopped off their own fingers as part of religious rituals, according to researchers. The proof? Hundreds of cave paintings depict hands missing at least a portion of their phalanges. “There is compelling evidence that these people may have had their fingers amputated deliberately in rituals intended to elicit help from supernatural entities,” archaeologist professor Mark Collard of Simon Fraser University in Vancouver told The Guardian. Collard recently presented a paper on his long-peddled self-mutilation theory at a European Society for Human Evolution, pointing to 25,000-year-old hand paintings in France and Spain. At least one finger was missing from each of the 200 prints. Some only parted with an upper segment, while others lost several. Collard’s presentation built upon his original idea — published in a 2018 study — that our prehistoric ancestors purposefully amputated to appease deities. As evidence, he and Ph.D. student Brea McCauley pointed to 100 other ancient societies where people practiced finger amputation and memorialized their lives with print and stencil hand paintings. “This practice was clearly invented independently multiple times,” they state in the paper. “And it was engaged in by some recent hunter-gatherer societies, so it is entirely possible that the groups at Gargas and the other caves engaged in the practice.” Scientists previously theorized the amputations could have reflected the use of sign language or a counting system, while others suggested it could have been caused by frostbite or that painters simply bent their fingers to create an illusion. Collard and McCauley argued that finger amputation is not the only form of self-mutilation practiced by ancient — and even some modern — societies. Other communities turned to fire-walking, face-piercing with skewers and putting hooks through skin so a person could haul heavy chains behind them instead, all of which accomplished similar, ritualistic goals. They also pointed to the Dani women of New Guinea Highlands, who continue to this day to chop off their fingers to signify the death of a loved one. “Quite a few societies encourage fingers to be cut off today and have done so throughout history,” he told the outlet. “We believe that Europeans were doing the same sort of thing in palaeolithic times, though the precise belief systems involved may have been different. This is a practice that was not necessarily routine but has occurred at various times through history, we believe.”",

    "title": "Relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane ‘honoured’ by OBEs | Hackney Gazette",
    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. The newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder. Kempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year. Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”. They described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”. Ms O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to. “She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.” Love Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls. Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive. “If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that. “We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area. “This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter. “So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace. “We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.” The handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said. She added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag. “Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace. “We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.” The next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide. Ms O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it. “Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.” Since Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women. The body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland. In February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far. He was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane. The rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane. The sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.",

Most of us know by now that using appropriate plants is the best choice for helping the local ecosystem, particularly the insects and other animals.\nThe thing about using native plants is that the animals and even other flora have evolved to coexist with them. The problem with introducing non-natives is that they can seed readily, outcompete native herbs and shrubs, and offer nothing to local animals.\nAlso, some of the most popular plants to put in ornamental gardens are harmful to the environment around them. In other words, these plants are best avoided when creating a luxurious landscape to bask in.\nBushes, Shrubs, & Trees The biggest problem with non-native bushes, shrubs, and trees is those species that are especially adept at seeding themselves quickly. They’ll often form a blanket of botanical prowess over landscapes such that natives have no space to grow anymore. Here are some of the biggest offenders.\nBradford pear ( Pyrus calleryana ) are beautiful flowering trees that bloom in spring and make a lasting impression. Unfortunately, they have a weak structure that makes them susceptible to storm damage, and they don’t Support local animals very well. Natives to check into instead of Bradford pear trees are serviceberry and shadbush. Burning bush ( Euonymus ssp ) has fiery red leaves that impress onlookers by standing out in the waves of greenery. However, they don’t offer native fauna anything, and worse yet, birds spread their seeds far and wide. Burning bush, then, quickly forms a dense thicket that snuffs out local plants. Fragrant sumac, ninebark, and red chokeberry might be native alternatives. Butterfly bush ( Buddleja davidii ) has amazing flowers that attract an abundance of butterflies . The problem is that they do not Support the life cycle of butterflies. Caterpillars don’t work on butterfly bushes. Plus, they will self-seed readily and form carpets of butterfly bushes instead allowing native plants to grow. Azaleas, hydrangeas, and other native bushes are more responsible options. Japanese barberry ( Berberis thunbergii ) is a fast-spreading, invasive plant with attractive foliage and berries. That said, they are thorny and grow densely because they spread so well. They are great habitats for mice and similar rodents, but they can cause issues in human habitats. Why not plant blueberries instead? Privet ( Ligustrum ssp ) is a very popular choice for hedges , and in fact, it’s used widely in the UK. Like these other plants, though, privet has the habit of spreading to places it hasn’t been planted and overtaking the native plants. That deprives local animals of foodstuff and habitats they have grown to rely on. Instead, look for local viburnum species. Vines Where invasive shrubs and trees tend to outcompete native plants not evolve to compete with them, many non-native vines can outcompete native species as well as grow so rampantly that they pull down and/or smother trees and shrubs. Beautiful or not, these are bad choices for the local ecosystem.\nAsiatic Bittersweet ( Celastrus orbiculatus ) is highly invasive, able to both seed itself via its pretty red autumn berries and spread via runners underground. Bittersweet can pull down trees in just a season or two. Maybe try trumpet honeysuckle instead. English Ivy ( Hedera helix ) can conjure regret as it spreads over every inch of the ground, climbs up every tree trunk, and invades the house. It’s evergreen and an impressive groundcover, but wild strawberry, Virginia creeper, and native clematis might be a better choice. Japanese Honeysuckle ( Lonicera japonica ) undeniably has a wonderful fragrance which is why it has been such a popular home garden plant for decades. Unfortunately, it is voracious and spreads like mad into wild spaces. Trumpet, aka coral, honeysuckle is a native that can work in place. Periwinkle ( Vinca ssp ) puts out an abundance of petite blue-purple flowers as it carpets the ground. It doesn’t, however, offer much to native animals, and it suppresses the native plants that would. Again, creeping phlox could be a great native for doing a similar landscaping job. Wisteria ( Wisteria sinesis ) is gorgeous in early spring before trees have leafed out. Its amazing purple blooms look like scrumptious bunches of grapes hanging through the forest. The Asian varieties of wisteria will take over an entire landscape and envelope a house in no time at all. There is a less aggressive American wisteria that has similar, though admittedly less impressive, blooms. In short, it’s entirely possible to make the garden stunning, diverse, and colorful without introducing problematic invasives. The trick is to look for native plants fulfilling the same natural niche and use them instead. Hopefully, that seems a little more possible now.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Comments Cancel reply You must be Login to post a comment.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

    "text": "Actualmente, VinFast lidera el desarrollo de la infraestructura al respecto con 150 mil puertos de carga para coches y motos eléctricos en todas las ciudades del país. Su red de estaciones de carga alcanza una densidad de aproximadamente 3,5 kilómetros por estación, lo que facilita el acceso a los usuarios. Junto con VinFast, la empresa EVIDA ha desarrollado el sistema de carga inteligente de vehículos eléctricos EBOOST, con más de 850 puntos de carga en todo el país. El Grupo de Electricidad de Vietnam (EVN) también se ha sumado con productos desarrollados por su centro de fabricación en la región central. Algunas otras marcas internacionales prestigiosas como Porsche, Audi o Mercedes-Benz instalaron sistemas de estaciones de carga para los clientes, pero el número aún es limitado y la mayoría se ubican en sus salas de exposición o fábricas. Entretanto, varias corporaciones mundiales líderes en el campo como Siemens, Charge y ABB también expresaron su intención de expandir el mercado comercial de estaciones de carga eléctricas en Vietnam. Tran Quang Ha, subdirector del Departamento de Ciencia, Tecnología y Medio Ambiente del Ministerio de Transporte, dijo que el desarrollo sincrónico de estaciones de carga es una medida importante para promover la conversión del transporte en Vietnam. Por tal motivo, la cartera recomienda políticas para desarrollar puestos de carga de vehículos eléctricos, especialmente en terminales, paradas, zonas urbanas, plazas de aparcamiento, centros comerciales, hoteles, oficinas y edificios. El ministerio se empeña en estudiar la exención de permisos de construcción y ajustar políticas de inversión en esas obras, además de proponer políticas preferenciales para las actividades de producción e importación de equipos y componentes para servir a esa labor, entre otros.",

    "text": "Itanagar: The second joint scientific expedition to Khangri Glacier in Tawang district was flagged off by Arunachal chief secretary (CS) Manish Kumar Gupta on Thursday. Centre for Earth Sciences & Himalayan Studies director (CES&HS) Tana Tage said, the expedition team consists of scientists, research associates, and technical officers from the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), Goa, CES&HS Itanagar, and researchers from IIT-Roorkee.“The Arunachal Himalayas are ecologically sensitive and face significant challenges related to climate change, including glacial melting, changes in freshwater availability, and the risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods,” Tage said. He added that the understanding of these dynamics are crucial for ensuring the sustainability of local ecosystems, economies, and communities dwelling in high altitudes.Tage said the aim of the expedition is to conduct in-depth glaciological and cryosphere studies in the Arunachal Himalayas, hydrological changes and their impact on the region’s ecosystem. Also various scientific activities like measuring glacier flow discharge, riverbed profiling, steam ice drilling and installation of water level markers and stacks for long-term observation would be conducted. Tage further said the team will also identify a suitable location to establish a permanent base camp as part of the Polar and Cryosphere Studies (PACER), which will serve as a logistical hub for future glaciological studies in the region, with a focus on the Khangri Glacier and other glaciers in Arunachal. He added that they will also engage in mass balance studies, which are crucial for understanding the gain and loss of ice mass from the glacier system. We also published the following articles recentlyKyrgyzstan opens rare probe into glacier destructionKyrgyzstan has initiated a criminal investigation into a private company's illegal destruction of glacial ice in the southern Osh region for a road to a coal mine. Glaciers in the country, crucial for freshwater, are at risk due to climate change and mining. This action underscores growing concerns over water shortages in Central Asia.114174395Researchers study Vijayanagara inscription in BarkurUnique research on two Vijayanagara-Tuluva inscriptions at Bhandarakeri Mutt in Barkur reveals historical details about Jain tradition and land donations dating back to the reigns of Krishnadevaraya and Achyutaraya. The study offers new insights into regional governance and religious practices, providing valuable timelines and context for Tulunadu's history.114176860Apple researchers conduct study on AIs reasoning ability in mathematics: What they foundApple researchers found that large language models (LLMs) show significant variability in mathematical reasoning when presented with different versions of the same question. They discovered that LLMs rely on pattern-matching rather than true logical reasoning, leading to inconsistent performance, especially in complex tasks. This calls into question the reliability of current metrics used to evaluate LLMs.114173142",
