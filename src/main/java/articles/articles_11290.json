    "title": "Former Lakewood Councilwoman Running for State Rep Attacks Lakewood Councilwoman for Using Position to Run for State Rep",
    "text": "Recent mailers sent out by Republican candidate Ramey Johnson’s campaign decry her Democratic opponent, Lakewood City Councilwoman Rebekah Stewart, for using her City Council position as a “stepping-stone” for a statehouse run. But on the other side of that same mailer, Johnson touted her own 10 years of prior experience on Lakewood’s City Council as a reason why she herself should be elected in November. Johnson and Stewart are both running for Colorado House District 30. The district is currently represented by Democrat Chris Kennedy, who defeated his Republican opponent by over 30 points in 2022. The mailer argued that Stewart’s campaign for the Colorado legislature shows she “lacks commitment to her current constituents.” In an emailed response to the Colorado Times Recorder, Johnson claimed that this statement was based on her own conversations with with Stewart’s constituents. “She served on city council for just a short time before making it known that she would run for a state office,” Johnson wrote. “That is a significant jump from one level of government to another. Her constituents who I talked with are concerned that she is using her councilor position as a steppingstone to a state office.” Stewart was first elected to Lakewood City Council in 2021. Her current term is set to end just over a year from now, in November 2025. Johnson has been a fixture in Lakewood politics for multiple decades: she ran multiple times to represent Lakewood in House District 23, succeeding in 2002 but failing to be reelected for a second term. She later won a 2011 vacancy election for Lakewood City Council, and was reelected to her seat twice in 2013 and 2017. Her final term ended in 2021. Johnson also unsuccessfully ran for Lakewood Mayor twice, in 2015 and 2019. Both runs took place while she was still in the middle of a City Council term. In an email to the Colorado Times Recorder, Stewart referenced these frequent runs, writing, “I find these kinds of statements ironic, given that my opponent has run for office more than 10 times, including two failed runs for mayor while she was still serving on the Lakewood City council.” She continued, “I’m running to continue to represent the constituents I already have the honor of serving and bring more power to their voices, needs, and hopes at the state level. The people of House District 30 deserve a Representative who is focused on the issues that affect them most—like housing affordability, protecting our clean air and water, and increasing access to mental healthcare. They’re not interested in dirty politics and mudslinging and neither am I.” In recent years, Johnson helped organize [a screening of a documentary](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2023/10/panelists-at-climate-denier-documentary-premiere-claim-climate-activists-are-anti-human/56558/) claiming climate change is a hoax, which starred her husband Walt Johnson. Along with over 100 other Colorado Republicans, she also [signed onto](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/01/qanon-promoters-pro-trump-supreme-court-brief-signed-by-several-colorado-gop-leaders/59368/) QAnon promoter Terpsehore Maras’ amicus brief intended to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to allow Donald Trump to remain on the Colorado Ballot. Maras’ brief claimed that Trump did not engage in insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. Johnson’s full response to the Colorado Times Recorder is included below. Thank you for asking me these pertinent questions. First, my opponent Rebekah Stewart is a nice lady. We have a cordial relationship. Early on, I invited her out for coffee to start things off on a “good foot”. She served on city council for just a short time before making it known that she would run for a state office. That is a significant jump from one level of government to another. Her constituents who I talked with are concerned that she is using her councilor position as a steppingstone to a state office. Additionally, some of her constituents have told me they believe it is because she is anxious to leave this position and that she is not committed to her ward, its issues or her city council responsibilities. As you know, I am a former state legislator and served on the city council for 10 years. This service has given me a depth and breadth of experience that only comes from time serving in an elected position. When I met with Rebekah, I asked her, “Why are you running”. She had only served for such a short time in her current position. She could not give an answer. I hope this helps you understand more fully the language in the mailing. Respectfully, Ramey Johnson",

    "text": "Japan’s factory output declined in November, weighed by falls in autos production and clouding the outlook for the export-reliant economy.\nIndustrial production fell 0.9% in November from the previous month, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) showed on Thursday. The reading was better than the median market forecast for a 1.6% drop.\nMotor vehicle production, which has underpinned industrial output, fell 2.5% in November from the prior month due to slowdowns in the manufacturing of small cars and engines, a METI official said.\nOutput of electrical machinery and information and communication electronics equipment also fell 3.5%, due to sluggish demand in semiconductor and integrated-circuit testing equipment, the official said.\nManufacturers surveyed by the industry ministry expect seasonally adjusted output to increase 6.0% in December and decline 7.2% in January. METI maintained its assessment of industrial output as “seesawing”.\n“We’ll continue to monitor the impact of the global economic downturn and rising prices,” the official said.\nFurthermore, a production halt at Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM)’s small car-unit Daihatsu due to safety scandal is expected to add downward pressure on output from January onward, the METI official said.\nThe small car specialist has suspended output in Japan until the end of next month, the company said this week.\n“Automobile-related production has recovered steadily (this year) thanks to easing supply constraints, but the risk of production cuts will need to be watched carefully in the near term,” said Kota Suzuki, an economist at Daiwa Securities.\nRegarding the outlook on semiconductor production, the METI official expected a gradual recovery.\nSeparate data showed Japanese retail sales expanded 5.3% in November from a year earlier. That was roughly in line with the median market forecast for a 5.0% gain and marked the 21st consecutive month of expansion since March 2022.\nCompared with the previous month, retail sales grew 1.0% in November, following a 1.7% decline in October, the data showed.\nSource: Reuters\n2023-12-29 hellenicshippingnews...",

    "title": "French fries vs. baked potatoes: New study reveals one raises diabetes risk by 20%",
    "text": "For decades, potatoes have been demonized as a carb-heavy dietary villain, blamed for weight gain and blood sugar spikes. But new research suggests the real culprit isn't the humble spud itself; it's how people prepare it.\nA groundbreaking Harvard University study reveals that eating french fries just three times a week may increase Type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk by a staggering 20 percent. Meanwhile, baked, boiled or mashed potatoes show no such danger. The findings challenge long-held assumptions about nutrition, forcing Americans to reconsider what's really on their plates.\nFor 30 years, Harvard researchers tracked the diets of more than 205,000 U.S. adults, analyzing how different potato preparations impacted long-term health. The results were striking: Every three servings of french fries per week raised diabetes risk by 20 percent, while non-fried potatoes had no significant effect.\nThe study published Aug. 6 in The BMJ, confirms that not all potatoes are created equal. Deep-frying transforms them from a simple starch into a metabolic time bomb. (Related: Defaulting to french fries could fry your health: How America's favorite side dish is fueling a diabetes crisis.)\nThe science is clear – french fries aren't just potatoes, they're a chemical and caloric disaster. Deep-frying at high temperatures produces acrylamide, a toxic compound linked to inflammation and insulin resistance.\nDeep-frying also strips away resistant starches, replacing them with trans fats and excessive oil, which further disrupt blood sugar control. Registered dietitian Melissa Mitri, who was not involved in the study, notes that fries are \"much higher in calories than baked or mashed potatoes.\"\nPotatoes naturally have a high glycemic index (GI), meaning they can cause rapid blood sugar spikes. But preparation matters: Boiled or mashed potatoes digest quickly, raising glucose levels fast.\nSurprisingly, fries – despite their fat content – have a slightly lower GI due to the crispy outer layer slowing digestion. Yet the trade-off isn't worth it. The harmful compounds and empty calories far outweigh any minor metabolic benefit.\nPerhaps the most alarming finding? The damage takes decades to surface. The study found that potato consumption 12 to 20 years before a diabetes diagnosis had the strongest link to risk. Type 2 diabetes doesn't develop overnight – it's a slow burn of insulin resistance fueled by years of poor eating habits.\nThe study adjusted for genetics, exercise and overall diet – yet the fry-diabetes connection remained strongest in two groups: People with higher BMIs and White participants. Excess weight exacerbates insulin resistance, meaning those already struggling with obesity face even greater danger from frequent fry consumption. Worse, fry lovers tended to eat more red meat, sugary drinks and processed foods – compounding the risk.\nThe good news? Small changes make a big difference. Replacing fries with whole grains (like farro or whole-wheat pasta) slashed diabetes risk by 19 percent.\nEven swapping baked potatoes for whole grains reduced risk by four percent. The only bad trade came in the form of white rice, which increased risk by three percent due to its lack of fiber and rapid digestion.\nThis study isn't about banning fries; it's about informed choices. In an era where Big Food pushes processed junk, individuals must take ownership of their health. Potatoes aren't evil, but drowning them in oil and salt is a recipe for disaster.",

    "text": "El Sevilla se despidió del último sueño que le mantenía distraído de su verdadera y triste realidad , que no es otra que salir del problemón del día a día, con la salvación como único objetivo de lo que resta de curso. En diciembre se le cayeron las competiciones europeas. Anoche, la Copa del Rey. La única ilusión que mantenía con algo de ilusión a una afición que encima tuvo que asistir al que entendieron como un nuevo error arbitral contra su equipo, con esa caída de Erik Lamela en el área en el último minuto del alargue. Gil Manzano señaló penalti y Hernández Hernández le llamó a capítulo . La imagen no aclaraba del todo la jugada, pero a este Sevilla no le sonríe ni la suerte, ni los arbitrajes, ni nada. Y menos con un colegiado principal que le tiene hace tiempo cogida la matrícula.\nY eso que la intención del Sevilla en el partido, por encima del asunto deportivo, no era otra que homenajear a esos tres sevillistas fallecidos en accidente de tráfico de camino a Madrid para ver a su equipo. Y eso que el Sevilla compitió como pocas veces en el curso. Con personalidad, poniendo nervioso a su adversario y aprovechando ciertos momentos del partido para llegar con peligro . Marcao y Ramos tuvieron remates en jugadas a balón parado para anotar. Sólo acertó Depay tras burlar Correa a un poco contundente Marcao. El central brasileño y Ramos estuvieron mejor en área rival que en la propia. Al menos, no cometieron errores imperdonables, ya que ambos pueden hacer mucho más en el 1-0 final.\nAhora, la realidad que le queda al conjunto de Nervión es evidente: salvar la categoría . Pensar que más que un año de transición, pueden ser varios si no logra mantenerse en la elite. Quique ha dado un pequeño paso afianzando el modelo de equipo que necesita en los próximos partidos: sin conceder en defensa y mediante el orden ir imponiendo su calidad en el otro área. Aunque sin victorias nada vale. Necesita puntos como el comer. Suma tres de 15 en Liga y ha caído eliminado en Copa. La mano del entrenador se ha frenado en el cuello de un equipo moribundo .",
