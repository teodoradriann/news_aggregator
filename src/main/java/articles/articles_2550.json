    "title": "West African Juntas Complain to UN Over Ukraine's Alleged Support for Rebels - allAfrica.com",
    "text": "The military rulers of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have written to the United Nations Security Council to denounce what they said was Ukraine's support for rebel groups in West Africa's Sahel region, according to Mali's foreign ministry.\nIn a joint letter, the three countries denounced the \"open and assumed support of the Republic of Ukraine for terrorism internationally, particularly in the Sahel\".\nThe countries asked the UN to \"take responsibility\" for Ukraine's actions and to prevent \"subversive acts\" that threaten regional and continental stability.\nThe letter was dated 19 August and circulated to the 15-member Security Council the following day, diplomats told Reuters news agency.\nThe text was also posted on the Malian foreign ministry's social media account.\nThe complaint marks a new stage in the deterioration of relations between these countries and Ukraine, according to experts.\nAccusations\nThe row arose over comments by a spokesperson for Ukraine's military intelligence agency about fighting in northern Mali that killed dozens of Malian soldiers and mercenaries from the Russian Wagner group in late July.\nBoth ethnic Tuareg separatists and jihadist insurgents operate in the region.\nSpeaking to Ukrainian media, spokesperson Andriy Yusov said rebels had received \"all the necessary information they needed\" to conduct \"a successful military operation against Russian perpetrators of war crimes\".\nMali interpreted the remarks as an admission of Ukraine's direct involvement in the conflict, accusing the country of supporting terrorist groups.\nMali's military government consequently cut diplomatic ties with Ukraine in early August, followed days later by Niger.\nAlong with Burkina Faso, the neighbours are allied by a mutual defence pact signed last year.\nRussian presence\nUkraine said it regretted the \"short-sighted and hasty\" decision by Mali and Niger to sever ties.\nThe Ukrainian government has since repeatedly called the allegations groundless, while an alliance of Tuareg rebels denied receiving its support.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines West Africa Arms and Armies Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

    "text": "La DANA va a complicar el puente y dejará mañana más de 100 litros en sur de Cataluña y Castellón Se recomienda evitar desplazamientos La presencia de la DANA va a seguir complicando el tiempo durante el puente de Todos los Santos y podría dejar este viernes más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2) en el sur de Cataluña y el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana, según la predicción del portavoz de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET), Rubén del Campo. Por ello, ha pedido consultar el estado del tiempo y de las carreteras si se va a emprender un viaje. Del Campo ha explicado que la situación más complicada de este viernes estará en el suroeste peninsular. En concreto, Huelva (Andalucía) registrará chubascos muy fuertes y podrá superar los 40 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2). A su vez, también caerán probablemente chubascos fuertes en otras zonas de Andalucía occidental y sur de Extremadura. Además, ha añadido que la situación seguirá siendo complicada en el área mediterránea, en el sur de Cataluña especialmente y en el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana. Allí, los chubascos podrán ser persistentes y los acumulados podrán superar los 100 l/m2. Esto puede provocar de nuevo crecidas en cauces e inundaciones en zonas bajas, por lo que el portavoz de AEMET ha recomendado alejarse de este tipo de zonas. A su vez, ha advertido sobre el clima en Baleares durante la jornada de mañana. En las islas, las lluvias podrán ser muy intensas y podrán dejar 50 l/m2 en sólo una hora o incluso 120 l/m2 en unas pocos horas. Al igual que en el caso de la Comunidad Valenciana, Del Campo ha pedido precaución en el archipiélago, dado que también pueden producirse crecidas e inundaciones en zonas bajas. El sábado continuará la inestabilidad con chubascos de nuevo fuertes y persistentes en el sur de Cataluña, en la Comunidad Valenciana y de nuevo en el archipiélago Balear. De forma más débil, se podrán registrar en puntos del tercio sur de la península. El portavoz de AEMET ha avanzado que la tendencia para el domingo y el lunes es la de que la DANA vaya desapareciendo y que la situación sea más estable. Aún así, ha indicado que todavía se producirán chubascos en el Levante, en Cataluña, en el área del Estrecho y en Baleares. Estos podrán ser fuertes aún durante el lunes, en especial en el sur de Cataluña, en la Comunidad Valenciana y en el sur de Aragón. De cara al martes y días siguientes probablemente se dará una situación más estable en todo el país, aunque a día de hoy, Del Campo no descarta posibles chubascos, una vez más, en el área Mediterránea. Todo esto estará acompañado con unas temperaturas que no van a variar demasiado y que serán en general algo más cálidas de lo habitual para esta época del año.",

    "text": "Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love helped fan stranded in blizzard before Packers win This might be the most Wisconsin story of all time: A Green Bay Packers fan goes to a hair appointment in the middle of a blizzard. Her car gets hopelessly stuck in a snow drift, and then none other than the Packers’ QB pulls up and offers his help. The best part? It’s all true: Lucy Kurowski braved Blizzard Bennett on Friday as she headed to her hair salon in De Pere, Wisconsin. The roads were treacherous, but she made it there safely. However, on her way home, she wasn’t so lucky. As she left the salon, [her car](https://www.dontwasteyourmoney.com/7-items-teen-drivers-need-for-their-cars/) got stuck in a snowdrift, leaving her unable to accelerate forward or reverse. But luckily a superhero of the green and gold variety arrived to offer his strength. MORE: [Snowed in, couple gets married in blizzard](https://www.simplemost.com/snowed-in-couple-gets-married-blizzard/) Over the weekend the area received up to 14 inches of snow, causing hundreds of accidents and disabled vehicles. Motorists were stranded on roadways across the state, but only 20-year-old Kurowski was lucky enough to get assistance from the Packers’ starting quarterback Jordan Love. The story quickly went viral after Kurowski’s aunt tweeted about her niece’s brush with the football star: Omg Jordan Love helping my niece out of a snow drift…what can’t he do? That’s my qb 💚 [pic.twitter.com/qv0p3Q5Jiz] — allie adames (@AllieKurowski) [January 12, 2024] Kurowski explained the situation to her local Fox 11 station, saying: “He gets out of his car and he’s like, ‘Are you OK?'” Kurowski told Fox 11. “And I was like, ‘Are you Jordan Love?!’ I was fangirling. I couldn’t even believe it.” Watch WLUK-TV Fox 11’s Michelle Melby interview Kurowski about the experience on YouTube below: Although Love tried his best, they both quickly realized that one man wouldn’t be able to budge the car out of the snow, despite being a top-tier athlete on a legendary football team. And, most importantly, Kurowski didn’t want her team’s QB risking an injury before his game on Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys. MORE: [High school football players save woman following car crash](https://www.simplemost.com/high-school-football-players-save-woman-car-crash/) “This is not a good idea, you have a game on Sunday,” she told him, and Love agreed. So she thanked him for his help, snapped a pic and sent Love on his way. Her caution proved worthwhile, as the Packers went on to destroy the Cowboys in a wildcard victory that has been [described](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-latest-playoff-failure-pours-fuel-on-a-potential-dallas-pursuit-of-bill-belichick/) as “arguably [the Cowboys’] most embarrassing playoff loss in recent memory.” Perhaps Love’s team can thank him, not only for his prowess on the field but also for racking up good karma off the field as well. And let’s not forget Wisconsin’s real MVP: Kurowksi’s hair stylist, out here styling hair even in the middle of a blizzard and making sure that Cheeseheads are ready to say cheese in all kinds of weather.
