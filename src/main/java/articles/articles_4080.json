    "text": "（马六甲26日讯）大马技职教育与培训（TVET）课程尚未“深入民心”，高等教育部联合公共服务局（JPA）推出包含助学金的TVET课程，逾9000个名额，仅有3000人接受被录取。\n该部副部长拿督慕斯达法说，昨日是大学招生系统（UPUOnline）申请入大专的最后一天，他发现高教部联合JPA推出的9530个TVET课程名额，只有3000人愿意接受就读。\n“那还有超过6000人去了哪里？不接受TVET，实在很可惜。”\n据他了解，多名被录取就读TVET课程的学生，在拒绝了这些学额后，一些会选择修读大学预科班（Matrikulasi）或者中六。\n他指出，JPA提供助学金的TVET课程，分布在全国各地的TVET中心、工艺学院（Politeknik），可能中学毕业生对TVET还很陌生，不了解其前景，因此才会拒绝。\n“看来，高教部、工艺学院要加倍努力，让TVET课程可以深入社区，特别是郊区及B40群体，让他们知道，通过TVET除了掌握一技之长，还可以改变他们的命运。”\n慕斯达法说，在TVET课程中，JPA提供的助学金包括学杂费，数额视不同课程而定，一些课程还提供津贴，等于学员不用花一分钱，在训练期间还有“收入”。\n他强调，他并不是说念中六还是大学预科班不好，但学生在选修科系时，应该多方面考量，做出最好的选择。\n慕斯达法是今日在马六甲，为“2025年第18届大马FIRA机器人大赛闭幕礼”主持仪式后，在记者会上如是指出。\n在场者计有工艺学院及社区学院教育局总监拿督扎哈里、甲州教育、高等教育及宗教事务副行政议员罗斯里等。\n上述比赛共获得1584名来自国内外的123所马专院校学生参与，雪州苏丹依德利莎工艺学院获得全场总冠军。",

    "text": "It's weird to be a grown-up orphan. It forced my siblings and I to reckon with faith Two years ago, my dad was in the ICU at a hospital in Salt Lake City. He'd been transferred there from a hospital in my hometown of Idaho Falls, Idaho, because his ruptured aorta demanded more experienced surgeons. My brother and sister and I flew in to be with him, but after a few days, the signs were trending positively, and he looked at us and deadpanned, \"What are you still doing here? I'm fine! Go!\" So we all kissed him on the cheek and flew back to our respective homes. He died a couple weeks later. Our dad, Stephen, was the parent who was supposed to stick around for a while. It's not like he was young. He was 74. That's a pretty good life. But he was in such good shape. He lifted weights most days and had no serious health issues, and so when he died it felt like we had been robbed again. Our mom, Linda, died of cancer in 2009. She was just 60 years old. She died before I met my husband. She never got to meet our kids. It felt very much like a life interrupted, cut way too short by a disease that made no sense in a woman who was such a life force herself. I had convinced myself that because God, or the universe or whatever, had taken away Mom so early, we were definitely going to get to hang out with Dad until he was shuffling around his house like the old man he was supposed to become. It didn't work out that way. Being a grown-up orphan is weird. I know I'm supposed to focus on how lucky I was to have my parents for as long as I did. But I still feel ripped off when my 9-year-old gets a hit in his little league game and I want to call my dad and give him the play-by-play. Or when my 11-year-old busts out in a song and dance in the kitchen, and I so desperately want to send a video to my mom because she would just love it – and him – so much. But it's deeper than that. After my dad died I felt an existential void. He and my mom both had rich and textured spiritual lives. With both of them gone, I realized I had never built that for myself. And I was consumed with questions about whether I had to in order to lead a meaningful, happy life. Last spring, I set out to try to answer that question by [talking to a lot of different people](https://www.npr.org/series/1175750522/enlighten-me-with-rachel-martin) who were swimming around in the same murky existential waters, but had emerged with some kind of clarity. One of the first conversations I recorded for this series was with my siblings, Abigail and Paul. I wanted to ask them direct questions about what they believe and how that did, or did not, help them navigate their own grief. We put that conversation in the vault for a while because it was so personal. But now, during the holidays, it feels OK to let it out into the world. I'm not in the same emotional place as I was eight months ago. I'm far more comfortable in my not-knowing-ness. I am finding meaning in my work and my community and my family in new ways. I don't feel empty anymore. But this conversation captures where I was at a particular point in time – my brother and sister too. And a level of honesty I don't think the three of us had shared before. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Rachel: My first question, I mean, I know the answer to these questions, some of them, but can each of you try to define Mom and Dad's spirituality? Abigail: Dad always seemed very pragmatic about spirituality. Like, he was all about scripture. Not that he was taking scripture literally, but he was really steadfast in what he believed. And yes, he would be open to conversations and challenges, but Mom morphed. When we were young, I didn't perceive Mom as this like hardcore Christian. Rachel: She was a dabbler. Abigail: Yeah. Past lives... Rachel: Right! Reincarnation, some meditation. Abigail: And then when she got sick, everything changed. And she became more in line with what Dad believed. Paul: I agree that Dad had maybe a more rigid view. He came from the Presbyterian tradition and Baptist before that. He had studied all of these other religions, but he studied them at arm's length. Whereas when Mom studied the other religions, she was open to the possibility that there were shared values, shared connections and philosophies that connected her spirituality to people of other faiths. Rachel: Yeah. Like when Dad would study other stuff, it was more like an intellectual exercise. Whereas Mom was studying with a practitioner's eye and heart. Like maybe she was going to incorporate that stuff into her own faith. Paul: Yeah. Rachel: So do you believe in God? Paul: I do. Yeah. I don't believe in a God in the sky pointing his finger like on the Sistine Chapel. I think the death of Mom and Dad made me go through a process of understanding, or made me think critically about what I do believe, you know, because it's no longer a theoretical thing. Of course I thought about it when we lost all our grandparents, but with Mom and Dad, that's every day you're thinking about, where are they, you know? What happened to them? So you have to process it differently. It did take some adaptation. I came to realize that when you think about what God is, it's a spark, it's the thing we all share that makes us unique. I think that resonates through a lot of different religions, and I think there's a lot of commonality to that concept. And so my belief of God is born of the Christian tradition, but certainly encompasses the idea that energy is special and it's in all of us and we all share it. Rachel: Do you think that it took Mom and Dad dying for you to be able to develop language around what you just said? To come to that conclusion about what God is to you? Paul: I think it was always there because we had been taught about other religions and other ideas. We'd never been told that other religions are wrong, that wasn't part of our upbringing. So it was that process of thinking critically about what I believed, and that was spurred by their deaths. Rachel: Abi, do you believe in God? Abigail: I did. I was so angry after Mom died. Towards the end, there was so much discussion about God and her faith and Dad's faith in the afterlife, and I still really struggle with understanding how someone so good could be taken from us. Going back to something that Paul was saying is that I believe in energy, because there are too many coincidences that occur for there not to be some power of some sort. I've had some really lovely happenstances with birds. And as we know, birds were Mom's thing. Rachel: She felt really connected to birds, seagulls in particular. Abigail: And so, I've had circumstances where I'm like, maybe there is a god. Maybe there is something. But I completely shut it down and cut it off when Mom died. And then when Dad died, it felt like we were going through the motions. Using the language that he had, what we grew up with, those traditions. Prayer is not something that happens in my life and sometimes I think I should pray because it's what we were taught we should do. But yeah, there's a lot of anger and sadness about it because I feel like I am missing something because I don't have that spirituality – I don't know if that's the right word. But God is not something that's present in my life. And I feel like there's a hole. Rachel: Yeah. I get that. Part of how I've been describing this, it's like Mom and Dad built this scaffolding, like spiritual scaffolding. They gave us the foundation, built like the exterior beams of what a spiritual life could look like. And then it was sort of up to us to build the rest of our spiritual home. And I feel like I never really got around to that part. Because they had such rich faith and strong religion, I felt like I didn't really have to do any of that work because it felt like it was there for me just whenever I needed a dose of it or something. I could retreat and I could take shelter in their faith. And then bail. So then when they died, I feel like all that's left is the scaffolding of it and it feels unsteady and empty. There's nothing there and I feel compelled to fill it up, but I'm not really sure how because the faith that we were raised in doesn't quite feel like it gives me everything that I'm looking for. Does any of that make sense to you or does any of that ring true to you? Abigail: Yes. Paul: Yeah, so the idea that we were beneficiaries or, like, the box was sort of checked by Mom and Dad, having that tent for us to be inside of, that resonates. You know, at some point it's up to you, cause it has to be a personal thing, right? It's abrupt for us to have a change when our home base is no longer there. But that doesn't mean it has to fulfill everything either. I also don't think it's bad or awful that we don't have our tent fully built out as soon as Mom and Dad are gone, because it's supposed to be an ongoing thing for our whole lives. And so we can always seek to work on our own tent. Rachel: Thank you for extending the metaphor. [laughs] Paul: It's a good metaphor. I like it. Rachel: Remember when Mom was sick, she started planting this idea in our minds that she was going to live in the wind, right? Which is why she gave us these beautiful wind chimes. And I've got mine hanging up and the wind will blow and I will think about her. And that's a useful story, you know, for thinking about what happens when the people we love aren't here anymore. That's what religion does in large part for people, it helps us make sense of that question. How have each of you thought about that? Do you believe in an afterlife? Paul: Well, you know, dust to dust. I think the energy goes back into the universe, like the law of thermodynamics. You can't create or destroy energy. So, like, I do believe in an afterlife, but I don't think it's one where we have a house and it's populated with all our dogs and friends and family and toys that we want and stuff like that. It's not something that we can really conceive of. I don't try to define what the afterlife is too much. I think there's limitations on our ability there. Rachel: Abi? Abigail: I want to. I want to believe that there's an afterlife. But the answer would be no. I think there's something. There's energy. What that is, I don't know, but it certainly is not that Mom is in heaven with Dad and our grandparents and they're having a dinner party. That logically doesn't make any sense to me. What about you? Rachel: Oh, me? I don't know. I think a lot of religious inquiry comes out of people trying to make sense of death and dying and the scariness of it and the uncertainty of it. And also parenting, explaining that stuff to your kids, you know? It's like, do I really tell them that there's, like, this place called heaven where Ima and Papa are? Paul: I mean, you think about whether people have gravesites or they are cremated and how we handle remains. A lot of that is for the survivors, right? And so you can help the survivors process the way they need to be able to do it. And I feel like, being the ones left behind, the concept of heaven or hell or an afterlife is one for the survivors again. And if we as a survivor need that, we have all of those memories and those things that our parents gave to us, which we're lucky to have, by the way. I mean, we had real lives with our parents. Rachel: Yeah. Paul: We can manifest them ourselves and have them with us when we want to. Rachel: I like that idea. Paul: We carry heaven in our pocket. Rachel: What? Did you just come up with that? Paul: I did. Abigail: That's good, Paul. Rachel: That's so good! Hurry, write it down! [laughs] Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "By Oliver O'Connell,Joe Sommerlad and Alex Woodward ,\n5 hours ago\nDonald Trump is back on the campaign trail following his conviction in New York last week.\nThe former president is doing a sweep of western states, beginning in Arizona, where at a town hall rally he mocked Joe Biden and brought Sheriff Joe Arpaio on stage during a segment on the border calling the president’s immigration order “bulls***”.\nMr Trump also this week sat down for an interview with TV psychologist Dr Phil . He was asked what he says to himself when the crowds aren’t cheering, and about his “hardest, darkest moment”.\nIn a separate interview with Fox News , Mr Trump downplayed the threat of climate change , insisting that international unrest is of greater concern and declaring: “The only global warming that matters to me is nuclear global warming.”\nThe Republican presidential candidate and convicted felon maintained that, while he remained a “very legitimate” candidate for the White House, the US had become a “banana republic”.\nMeanwhile, the judge in the classified documents case in Florida will allow several parties not involved in the case to argue in favor of the former president’s attempt to dismiss the charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Yo paraba guerras con llamadas de teléfono\", dijo.\nTrump repitió su denuncia de que el actual presidente, Joe Biden, y la vicepresidenta, Kamala Harris, \"nos están llevando al precipicio de la III Guerra Mundial\". Él, según afirmó, devolverá la paz al mundo.\nLA PROMESA DE UNA CÚPULA DE HIERRO\nEl exmandatario también incidió en la promesa de erigir en Estados Unidos una Cúpula de Hierro como la israelí.\nLos demócratas usan la Torre Trump para proyectar mensajes antirepublicanos\nhttps://www.expreso.ec/actualidad/mundo/democratas-torre-trump-proyectar-mensajes-antirepublicanos-210707.html\n\"Ayudamos a Israel y otros países.

Vance, intentan contrarrestar el foco mediático que se cierne sobre la Convención Nacional Demócrata de Chicago, que ha oficializado la candidatura de Harris a la Casa Blanca.\nTrump y su equipo acudirán estos días a cuatro estados clave: Pensilvania, Míchigan, Carolina del Norte y Arizona, en los que se centrarán en cuestiones cruciales para los conservadores de cara a las presidenciales del 5 de noviembre, como la inmigración, la seguridad o la economía.\nDe momento Harris encabeza las intenciones de voto con un porcentaje del 46,6 %, 2,9 puntos más que Trump, según la media de sondeos efectuada por la web FiveThirtyEight.\n\"Van a mentir como demonios para ganar las elecciones porque no tienen límites\", dijo este miércoles Trump del bando demócrata. \"Si nosotros no ganamos vamos a estar en un problema muy grande como país. Ya lo estamos, pero yo lo voy a arreglar\", concluyó.\n¿Quieres acceder a todo el contenido de calidad sin límites?\n¡SUSCRÍBETE AQUÍ!",

    "title": "The Traitors Series 2: Best Tactics for Survival | Den of Geek",
    "text": "[Features](https://www.denofgeek.com/features/) The Traitors Series 2: Best Tactics for Survival Season 1 of The Traitors taught us some lessons in tactics. Will the season 2 contestants learn? This article contains spoilers for The Traitors s1 and episodes 1-3 of The Traitors s2 [The Traitors](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-traitors-best-moments-so-far-the-drama-the-deception-the-hilarious-tears/) is back for a second series and with it a castle, a Winkleman, challenges, amateur detective work and some slowly emerging villains of the show. A game show (of sorts), with contestants competing for a share of a large sum of money accumulated each episode by winning tasks, the meat of [The Traitors](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/bbc-the-traitors-review-reality-show-backstabbing-lies/) is mind games that bookend each episode, when one player gets banished, and another gets “murdered”. Three episodes have landed – all at once on iPlayer, one a night on BBC One. From episode four they’ll arrive on iPlayer in line with their broadcast dates. Three eps in and we’ve had enough time with the contestants to start to get a sense of who the runners and riders will be, and what tactics will get you banished quicker than a bad smell. End of ep three brought an amazing cliffhanger. Diane! Ross! Zack! Brian! Ash! Winkleman teasing more big reveals! There’s a lot to come. Winners of series one were Hannah, Aaron and Meryl, three faithful, who managed to out Wilf in the last round. Wilf played a really good game but the show’s logistics kind of turned him over with the option given not to become a traitor early in the game knocking the number of traitors down too quickly. This meant in the final rounds Wilf was the only traitor left, leaving the possibility for him to be knocked out and derailing the final episode of the show – no murder, no end game tension. Instead a final player was forced to become a traitor (or be murdered, but what would be the point of that?). This was Kieran, who became a scapegoat, got voted out and then threw Wilf under the bus. It seems like series two has learned by not giving Miles an option to say no when he was invited to be the fourth traitor. But what else can the contestants learn from series one? A woman not raising a glass of water is not a sign someone is a traitor The first person to get banished in series one was a woman called Nicky, who gets accused of being a traitor because she didn’t raise a water glass in a toast. Nicky has one hand, and the glass was on the other side of her. Plus it’s a drink of water people!! Early doors in The Traitors it’s obviously quite difficult to find reasons to identify someone as a traitor but trying to pick up on idiosyncrasies like this is a hiding to nothing. You’re better off picking the most innocuous looking person at the table. As in, if you were the producers who would you choose to be a traitor? So when Sonia tries to take Zack down like a cut-price Miss Marple, for making some stupid-arse remark about having a good night’s sleep, it backfires. In a “whoever smelt it dealt it” move, Sonia was banished first. Being abrasive isn’t a good move The real reason Nicky got banished in s1 is because she was just a bit rude. This time around Anthony’s neck was almost on the block for the same thing – he was a bit rude to Diane, he was really defensive with Zack, and when called out on these things his response was stroppy. Doesn’t make him a traitor though, and in fact you’re almost less likely to be a traitor if you’re a bit of a git. Sadly if the gang don’t like you you’ll probably get booted out anyway. Being annoying also does not help Series one had Tom the magician who was incredibly annoying. He was cocky and embarrassing and when the big series 1 reveal came out, that Tom and Alex were a couple, it was because he totally lost his cool (and we suspect it was because Alex was having a little flirt with Matt and awful Tom wanted to mark his territory). Series 2 has Zack and Brian. Zack is a weird, giggly conspiracy theorist who says stupid things that rub people up the wrong way. You get a sense that he doesn’t mean to upset people but can’t hold his tongue. Take his interaction with Anthony, where his plan seemed to be just to say “ha ha, I hear you can’t row”. What reaction did you think he was going to have, Zack? The thing is Zack is quite smart, and somehow guessed that Diane was someone’s mum in the competition. He just guessed wrong who her kid was. Then there’s Brian. Voted by the others as the biggest “sheep” of the contestant, he got upset during the ep 3 task. Then at the roundtable, he basically lost his mind. Having been gently accused by Jasmine of behaving a bit strangely he doubled down and behaved like an absolute mad man, taking the floor at the very last minute of discussion time to ask the whole table to discuss whether “I am or I amn’t” a traitor. Selfish for a start, bonkers to follow. This move earned him a three-way tie as traitor in the initial vote. Don’t fluff the big twist! Episode 3 comes with the big reveal that Diane is Ross’ mum (and not Paul’s as Zack had guessed). The similar twist in season 1 was the Tom and Alex relationship and Tom absolutely ruined this for them and sealed their fates. You don’t want to go into a game of deception already lying. So they need to NOT give the game away. Fortunately Ross seems fairly switched on, and Diane, who is clearly a very smart cookie, might well find herself voted out for being too damn clever. The quiet ones Mollie, Meg, Charlie, Tracey, Jaz, there’s not that much about you right now. That can help but it can also line you up for a murdering – they are collateral damage which the traitors can knock off without implicating themselves. The noisy ones You don’t wanna be too far above the parapet either though. Kyra got murdered for being forthright at the table (and probably for being a bit shady over the shields), Aubrey was knocked off for his aggressive sleuthing and Ash has put herself squaring in front of the firing squad for being way too overt. So much so her fellow traitors vote for her – let’s face it, she’s a liability. Who do we like? At the end of episode 3 we still don’t know who’s being banished (it’s a tie right now, gulp!), and we don’t know who is being murdered. But that taken into account, here’s who we think has a reasonable chance of winning. Faithful: Charlotte. She’s likeable, smart and quite funny. But not so conspicuously smart that she poses a threat right now. Jasmine. Level-headed and can do amazing bird noises. Has a sense of fairness and seems to stay calm easily. If she goes it’ll be murder. Jonny. Second most popular in the group, good competitor in the tasks, relatively smart but not good at picking out the traitors. A safe bet so far. Traitors: Harry. Looks like a sweet baby angel and is playing up to that. Least likely to be thrown under the bus by other traitors. Miles. A later traitor but no one suspects him yet. Very calm. Paul. Third choice. Paul is riding high right now but he’s a stone cold psycho. I think he’s the least likely to win from the traitors because of his hubris. He’s popular but people can turn on the popular very fast. Miles and Harry are far more unassuming. Ash is out the door. A.N. Other. It’s quite likely after Ash inevitably gets booted they pick someone new. This will almost certainly be a woman. Meg is a reasonable choice because she’s made no enemies but no decisions either so will be easy to knock off. Ultimately the traitors need two of them to get to the last round to win (see [Traitors USA](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-traitors-us-vs-uk/)) and it’ll be Harry and Miles unless some major curveballs arrive. Who do you like? Let us know in the comments.",
