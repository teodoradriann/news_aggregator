    "text": "A Moroccan man who stabbed to death a passer-by in the street in northeast England in what he later told police was revenge for Israeli action in Gaza was found guilty of murder on Thursday. Ahmed Alid, 45, who had sought asylum in Britain, killed his 70-year-old victim after approaching him from behind on a road in Hartlepool the early hours of Oct. 15 last year, having previously attacked his housemate with two knives, prosecutors said. After his arrest, he told detectives he had committed the acts because of the war in Gaza, and in revenge for Israel killing innocent children, and blamed Britain for creating Israel, Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Alid said if he had had a machine gun and more weapons, he would have killed more people. \"By his own admission, Ahmed Alid would have killed more people on that day if he had been able to,\" Nick Price, head of the CPS Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said in a statement. \"Whatever his views were on the conflict in Gaza, this was a man who chose to attack two innocent people with a knife, and the consequences were devastating.\" Alid had first used two knives to attack his sleeping housemate, to whom he had become aggressive after learning of his conversion to Christianity, stabbing him six times while shouting \"Allahu Akbar,\" or \"God is greatest,\" the CPS said. The 32-year-old housemate, one of five asylum seekers who shared the property, managed to fight him off and another occupant came to his aid. Alid left the house with one of the knives and walked toward the center of Hartlepool. He passed Terence Carney, 70, on the opposite side of the road before circling back and attacking him from behind, stabbing him six times in the chest, abdomen and back. Carney died shortly after police arrived. Following his interview with police, he attacked the two female detectives, with one suffering injuries to her shoulder and wrist. He was found guilty at Teeside Crown Court of murder, attempted murder and two counts of assaulting an emergency worker. He will be sentenced on May 17, when the judge will decide if his actions were related to terrorism.",

    "text": "It’s been 25 years since Major M Saravanan laid down his life at Kargil, but his heroics continue to inspire generations of youth in his home town Trichy. New cadets of 2TN NCC Battalion Trichy, of which the Vir Chakra awardee was a part in college, are told his valiant story.On May 28, 1999, Major Saravanan’s unit was tasked to capture point 4268 on Jubar ridge on the western side of Batalik, the second highest battlefield in Ladakh. The next day, he killed two enemy soldiers by firing a rocket launcher at them. He was wounded in the stomach by shrapnel, but Saravanan soldiered on ignoring calls by his seniors to return. He killed two more enemy soldiers before being hit by a bullet in his head and falling into a ravine. His family said his mortal remains were recovered 37 days after his death, after his Bihar regiment recaptured the point.Trichy corporation has renamed two city roads, Royal Road and Lawsons Road, as Major Saravanan Road to honour the war hero. The road has a Major Saravanan memorial and campus of 117 Infantry Battalion (TA) The Guards. The memorial with his portrait in Trichy city resembles a ‘hero stone (Natu Kal)’, an ancient practice in Tamil tradition commemorating the honourable death of a war hero.Saravanan was born the eldest son of Lt Col Adi Mariappan, an officer in Army Medical Corps, and Amirthavalli Mariappan on August 10, 1972, in Rameshwaram. His father died in an accident in Bengaluru in 1989. Saravanan was president of the students union while doing BA Economics at St Joseph’s College in Trichy (1989-91). Being part of the college’s NCC unit, he was persuaded to join Officers Training Academy, Chennai, from where he graduated in 1995. Commissioned into 1 Bihar, he was promoted as captain in 1996 and as major in 1999.“He was initially shy in the first year of college as he was new to Trichy, having completed schooling in Bihar. But later he caught up,” recalls S Karthikeyan, a close friend. “Two months before his martyrdom, he visited us for a vaca tion. I was at the railway station to send him off. Little did we know, that was the final goodbye,” said 53-year-old Karthikeyan, now a businessman in Theni.According to Colonel Arun Kumar, commanding officer, 2 TN NCC Battalion Trichy, the martyr’s heroics are narrated to cadets during training. “We clean his memorial with cadets on special occasions and pay floral tributes. No matter how many years pass, his heroics will inspire local cadets to protect the nation,” he said“We are planning to erect an 80-foot pole at the memorial to fly the national flag round the clock,” said M Senthil Kumar, Major Saravanan’s brotherin-law and managing trustee of Major Saravanan Memorial Trust.",

    "text": "Se revelaron detalles escalofriantes sobre la muerte del ladrón de 16 años abatido por un comerciante después de un robo en el partido bonaerense de La Plata. A menos de una semana del fatídico suceso que conmocionó a la localidad de Tolosa, el informe forense reveló que Ariel Rubén Darío González recibió cinco disparos, tres de los cuales impactaron en su espalda mientras intentaba escapar. El documento oficial, emitido por la Morgue Judicial de La Plata, detalla que la causa directa del fallecimiento de González fue un \"shock hipovolémico, secundario a lesión pulmonar, cardíaca y de los grandes vasos, producidas por herida de proyectil de arma de fuego\". El asaltante recibió cinco disparos cuando intentaba huir de la distribuidora \"Don Otto\", ubicada en calle 520 de la capital bonaerense, después de haber asaltado el lugar junto a un cómplice el pasado viernes 19 de abril. Fue trasladado de urgencia al hospital zonal pero murió a causa de las múltiples lesiones en varias partes del cuerpo, incluido el tórax, región escapular, inguinal, sacra y glúteo derecho. Suscribite Detalles del informe Según las doctoras Lorena Bologna y María Florencia Picone, peritos médicos legistas de la Asesoría Pericial de La Plata, estas heridas ocasionaron lesiones graves en órganos vitales como los pulmones y el corazón, provocando un \"hemotórax masivo bilateral, hemopericardio y sangrado en retroperitoneo\", lo que desencadenó el fatal desenlace, según la pericia citada por Infobae. El informe además detalla minuciosamente la trayectoria de cada uno de los proyectiles, desde el ingreso en el subescapular izquierdo hasta el último balazo en la región inguinal izquierda. - Primer disparo: Ingresó por el subescapular izquierdo, con trayectoria de abajo hacia arriba y de derecha a izquierda, sin ingresar a la cavidad torácica, con salida por orificio a nivel escapular izquierdo. Felicitas Alvite, la tiktoker que se hace llamar “La Toretto” y atropelló y mató a un motociclista en La Plata - Segundo disparo: Impactó en la región dorsal derecha del tórax, con trayectoria de atrás hacia adelante, de derecha a izquierda y de abajo hacia arriba. En este caso, la bala sí ingresó a la cavidad torácica. - Tercer disparo: Ingresó a la altura del sacro, con trayectoria horizontal, de atrás hacia adelante ligeramente hacia arriba, generando \"lesión ósea, y compromiso de estructuras vasculares de retroperitoneo\". - Cuarto disparo: Impactó en el glúteo derecho, con trayectoria de atrás hacia adelante. - Quinto disparo: Ingresó en la región inguinal izquierda. La hipótesis de legítima defensa El fiscal Álvaro Garganta, titular de la UFI N°11, sigue trabajando para dar con el paradero del cómplice de González, que aún permanece prófugo desde el fatídico suceso. Las primeras pruebas incorporadas al expediente, incluyendo las grabaciones de las cámaras de seguridad del local, apuntan a que los hechos se desarrollaron en una única secuencia, con el ladrón en fuga tras el asalto. Ola de robos en colegios de Palermo: ocho ladrones detenidos, algunos de ellos menores y reincidentes Si bien las investigaciones preliminares sugirieron dudas sobre la secuencia de los disparos y la legítima defensa del comerciante, eventualmente fueron descartadas tras el análisis de las pruebas, incluyendo las imágenes de las cámaras de seguridad del local. En tanto, el fiscal Garganta sostiene la hipótesis de que el comerciante actuó en legítima defensa, una postura que mantiene incluso después de conocer los detalles de la autopsia que dictaminaron que disparó al ladrón por la espalda, emulando la doctrina Chocobar. Según fuentes judiciales, \"el peligro continuaba latente para el comerciante, podía darse vuelta y disparar\", lo que habría reforzado su actuación. Cómo fue el asalto El hecho ocurrió el mediodía del viernes pasado en la distribuidora de fiambres y lácteos Don Otto, ubicada en 12 y 520 de Tolosa, en La Plata, cuando dos ladrones intentaron asaltar a los empleados a punta de pistola, exigiendo que entreguen el dinero que había en la caja. Uno de los empleados pudo escapar y dio aviso al dueño de la firma, un hombre de 46 años, quien se encontraba en un piso superior. Fue entonces cuando bajó con una pistola y enfrentó a ambos ladrones . Uno de los disparos abatió a uno de ellos, dejándolo tendido en la vereda junto a su arma; mientras que su cómplice huyó. En la puerta de local, en tanto, quedó una moto marca Blitz que tenía pedido de secuestro ya que había sido robada días antes del hecho. El incidente entre el propietario del comercio y los asaltantes quedó registrado en una de las cámaras de seguridad ubicada en el sector de la caja, imágenes que quedaron a disposición de la justicia al igual que la moto de los asaltantes. Según contó a la prensa el abogado del comerciante imputado, Marcelo Mazzeo, el delincuente fallecido intentó abrir fuego contra el comerciante pero no le salió el disparo. “Su arma tenía una munición percutada. Mi cliente respondió cuando escuchó gatillar el revólver del delincuente”, indicó. Por su parte, el comerciante postergó su declaración y se espera que ocurra esta semana. CD / Gi",

    "text": "Premier League\nEl Liverpool sale aún más reforzado de un Boxing Day en el que pincharon Chelsea, United y City\nLos 'reds' remontaron al Leicester (3-1) y son más líderes\nLos de Guardiola empataron (1-1) en casa contra el Everton\nEl Chelsea se vio sorprendido por el Fulham y los 'red devils' por los Wolves\nEP\nEl [Liverpool](/tags/liverpool-fc/) disfrutó del Boxing Day de la [Premier](/tags/premier-league/) con una remontada (3-1) ante el Leicester con la que aumentó su condición de líder, gracias también a la derrota (1-2) del [Chelsea](/tags/chelsea-fc/) ante el Fulham, mientras que el [Manchester City](/tags/manchester-city/) y el [United](/tags/manchester-united/) alargaron sus crisis en un 1-1 contra el Everton y un 2-0 ante el Wolves.\nEl equipo 'red' tuvo más emoción de la esperada en Anfield, ante el tercer equipo por la cola de la tabla, pero no tardó en enderezar un camino que no parece tener quién lo tuerza. En medio de la niebla apareció Jordan Ayew para adelantar a los 'Foxes', a los cinco minutos, cuando el Liverpool ya había tenido un par de ocasiones.\nLos de Ruud van Nistelrooy fueron valientes y tuvieron la opción incluso del segundo, pero el cuadro local sacó el rodillo. Aunque se hizo esperar el gol, justo antes del descanso, Cody Gakpo firmó un disparo perfecto para el 1-1. El asedio siguió en la reanudación y Curtis Jones rubricó la remontada, con algo de suspense del VAR. Sin duda era cuestión de tiempo, como el gol de Mo Salah, un pase a la red en el 82' del mejor jugador de la Premier.\nAsí, el líder Liverpool sumó 42 puntos, siete más y aún con un partido menos que un Chelsea que dejó escapar la victoria en los últimos minutos del derbi contra el Fulham, que logró su primer triunfo en 45 años en Stamford Bridge.\nLos de Enzo Maresca se adelantaron con el 1-0 que firmó Cole Palmer al cuarto de hora, prometiendo una jornada navideña redonda para los 'blues'. Sin embargo, los de Marco Silva, en busca de una sexta jornada seguida sin perder, no dejaron de intentarlo y encontraron una épica remontada con los cambios. Harry Wilson, en el 82', y Rodrigo Muniz, en el 95', bajaron las aspiraciones de título de un Chelsea que venía de empatar con el Everton.\nPor otro lado, el Boxing Day sonrió a un Nottingham Forest que sigue volando para asentarse en el 'Top 4', con un 1-0 sobre un Tottenham tocado, solo una victoria en seis jornadas. Mientras, Newcastle y Bournemouth también alargaron su buena dinámica en puestos europeos a costa del Aston Villa (3-0) y el Crystal Palace.\nLa racha goleadora de Alexander Isak continuó en el triunfo local en St. James' Park, donde el Villa de Unai Emery jugó con uno menos desde la roja a Jhon Duran a la media hora. Mientras, el Bournemouth de Andoni Iraola no pudo (0-0) con el Palace en un encuentro igualado y sin grandes ocasiones pero sigue sumando en zona noble.\nPesadilla de los de Manchester en Navidad\nAdemás, en el duelo que abrió la jornada, el Manchester City alargó su crisis con un 1-1 ante el Everton. Los de Pep Guardiola no encuentran fin a su pesadilla: una victoria en los últimos 13 partidos entre todas las competiciones. En el Etihad Stadium, el City perdonó y volvió a ver los fantasmas de otro tropiezo más, sobre todo cuando Erling Haaland falló un penalti ante Jordan Pickford en el inicio del segundo tiempo.\nEl partido había empezado de cara para el campeón con el 1-0 de Bernardo Silva y el propio portugués perdonó el segundo, pero pronto empató el Everton, en la primera que tuvo, con Iliman Ndiaye. Tampoco acertó el equipo de Guardiola en un quiero y no puedo en el segundo tiempo, para quedarse séptimo en la tabla (28), a cinco puntos de la zona Champions y a 14 del Liverpool con un partido más.\nAdemás, el Manchester United encajó otro mal resultado con un Ruben Amorim que parece lejos de resucitar a los 'red devils'. La roja de Bruno Fernandes y el partidazo de Matheus Cunha, con gol olímpico y asistencia ya en el descuento para Hee-Chan Hwang, sirvieron el dos de dos del nuevo técnico del Wolves, un Vitor Pereira que sí funciona como revulsivo.\nResultados\n- Manchester City - Everton 1-1.\n- Bournemouth - Crystal Palace 0-0.\n- Chelsea - Fulham 1-2.\n- Newcastle - Aston Villa 3-0.\n- Nottingham Forest - Tottenham 1-0.\n- Southampton - West Ham 0-1.\n- Wolverhampton - Manchester United 2-0.\n- Liverpool - Leicester 3-1.\n-Viernes 27.\n- Brighton - Brentford.\n- Arsenal - Ipswich.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=El%20Liverpool%20sale%20a%C3%BAn%20m%C3%A1s%20reforzado%20de%20un%20Boxing%20Day%20en%20el%20que%20pincharon%20Chelsea%2C%20United%20y%20City%20https://www.laopiniondezamora.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941091.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.laopiniondezamora.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941091.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.laopiniondezamora.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941091.html&text=El%20Liverpool%20sale%20a%C3%BAn%20m%C3%A1s%20reforzado%20de%20un%20Boxing%20Day%20en%20el%20que%20pincharon%20Chelsea%2C%20United%20y%20City%20%20https://www.laopiniondezamora.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941091.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40laopiniondezamora)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=El%20Liverpool%20sale%20a%C3%BAn%20m%C3%A1s%20reforzado%20de%20un%20Boxing%20Day%20en%20el%20que%20pincharon%20Chelsea%2C%20United%20y%20City%20&body=https://www.laopiniondezamora.es/deportes/2024/12/26/liverpool-sale-reforzado-boxing-day-112941091.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",
