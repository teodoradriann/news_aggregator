    "text": "（台北讯）F4近日在五月天演唱会惊喜合体，让无数粉丝回忆涌现。F4成员之一的朱孝天日前直播时罕见分享多年来F4情谊，直认与F4三子“不熟”，而谈到已故女星大S（徐熙媛）时数度落泪，直言她是“贯穿我们四个人生命的女孩”，一席真情流露感动无数粉丝。\nF4睽违12年在五月天演唱会合体，其中阿信更是最大功臣。朱孝天16日透过直播表示，五月天的经纪人艾姐总共约了2、3次，而他也把其中的利与弊、个人现况等通通讲给对方听，进而婉拒邀约，但艾姐依旧不肯放弃。\n“她说，还是希望约我出来再谈一次，第二次还是第三次吧，我直接坐下来说，‘我不知道你在坚持什么，你可不可以跟我讲一下，你的执念是什么？’。”\n结果艾姐转述了阿信的理念，“阿信啊！觉得我们年轻的时候，所有的美好东西，都正在逐渐消失中，他想把这些仅存的美好再次集结，其中一个就是你们的合体。”这让朱孝天不禁直呼：“我听了就不好拒绝了！”\n面对网友好奇是不是真的和其他F4成员不熟？朱孝天也坦承“是真的！”但他解释彼此的关系不怎么样，“就是凑在一起聊聊天、在一起工作、唱唱歌、演演戏，会很开心，但是日常生活里就是找不到点，已经有9年的时间，没有跟他们3个聚在一起！”\n朱孝天坦言，当年能因《流星花园》一炮而红，全赖与大S的合作，形容她是将F4连结起来的重要人物。“我相信我们四个人，在年轻时都用不同的方式爱过她，这是一种超越爱情的情感。”对于大S于今年2月骤逝，朱孝天仍难掩哀痛。\n他提到自己原本不想公开谈论，“不想吃人血馒头”，但随着时间过去，这份感情仍压抑不住。他坦承，近日遭酸民质疑为何替汪小菲的品牌“麻六记”直播带货，对此，他回应：“我真的希望他能赚很多钱，不然2个小孩谁照顾？需要被照顾。”他表示，孩子失去母亲后，父亲的责任更重大，“我只希望他能撑起整个家。”\n朱孝天直播画面中浮肿的面容也引发关注，事实上他近年受“纤维肌痛症”所苦，需长期用药，导致体态变化明显，但他表示自己很享受当下的自在生活，对外型转变并不在意。不少粉丝留言表示感动：“他不是为了流量，而是真心的惋惜”、“这才是真正的兄弟情”、“愿孩子平安长大，愿大S安息”。朱孝天也宣布短期内将暂停直播，“现在的氛围不适合卖货”，再度展现对大S的尊重与哀悼。\n中国报官方WhatsApp平台！\nhttps://t.me/chinapressonline",

    "text": "The DUP Health Spokesperson stated:\n“On 10th December, I raised concerns in the NI Assembly with the Minister, Mike Nesbitt, about the lack of accreditation for cervical screening within the Belfast Trust and the awarding of the regional HPV testing contract to the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH).\nSince then, I have received additional information, including the resignation letters of two senior medics and a further letter to the Minister questioning these same issues. Alarm bells should ring when professionals with oversight of such a critical programme raise such serious concerns. What is needed now is full disclosure, openness, and transparency from both the Department and the Trust regarding these matters.\nConfidence in the effectiveness of cervical screening is of paramount importance to women across Northern Ireland. Accreditation is designed to ensure that policies and processes are followed and that standards are met. It is therefore incomprehensible that, despite having its accreditation suspended, the Belfast Trust was still permitted to submit an expression of interest for the regional HPV cervical screening service. Why was this allowed?\nI have also written to ask whether the new HPV laboratory is still operating without accreditation, and whether smear tests are being sent to Gateshead. If so, at what additional cost to the public purse?\nI have previously called for a public inquiry into the scandal within the Southern Trust, which impacted 17,000 women, eight of whom developed cancer after their smear tests were misread. Tragically, two of these women have since passed away. However, there is now mounting concern about the cervical screening programme on a province-wide level. Any inquiry must be broadened to investigate beyond the Southern Trust.\nWomen across Northern Ireland deserve prompt and decisive action to restore their trust in cervical screening. The public demands answers and accountability from those responsible for creating this appalling situation.”",

Mickaëlle Paty : (…) Après l’attentat terroriste ayant coûté la vie au professeur Dominique Bernard, on est en bon droit de se demander : qu’avons-nous fait concrètement pour que cela ne se reproduise pas ? C’est simple, j’ai le sentiment que nous avons perdu trois ans ! Et si nous continuons ainsi, [d’autres professeurs seront assassinés](https://www.lepoint.fr/societe/jean-pierre-obin-ne-pas-laisser-chaque-prof-seul-face-a-sa-classe-19-10-2020-2397162_23.php). Car nous ne sommes pas dans « l’après »-Samuel Paty, mais encore dans le « pendant »… [Les perturbations recensées lors du dernier hommage](https://www.lepoint.fr/societe/attentat-a-arras-179-eleves-ont-perturbe-l-hommage-a-dominique-bernard-17-10-2023-2539815_23.php) qui lui a été rendu, le 16 octobre dernier – soit trois jours après l’attentat d’Arras –, parlent d’elles-mêmes. Et [la dernière enquête de l’Ifop menée sur le sujet](https://www.ifop.com/publication/abayas-burqa-attentat-darras-enquete-aupres-des-musulmans-sur-la-laicite-et-la-place-des-religions-a-lecole-et-dans-la-societe/) en atteste : 38 % des musulmans de 15 à 17 ans n’expriment pas une condamnation totale à l’égard de l’assassin de Dominique Bernard. C’est deux fois plus que chez les musulmans adultes. Force est de constater que certains refusent purement et simplement de faire société avec nous. (…) Il reste de l’incompréhension après ce procès, avec le sentiment d’une deuxième chance accordée bien facilement alors qu’on a ôté à mon frère la sienne. C’est peu dire que les condamnations des mis en cause nous paraissent légères au regard des conséquences. Il n’y a pas de justice, disait Camus, il n’y a que des limites. Mais que reste-t-il des limites si on les franchit presque sans incidence ? Pour moi, la clémence de ce jugement, qui privilégie l’éducation plutôt que la punition, n’envoie pas le bon message. (…) Regrettez-vous, comme Mickaëlle Paty, le message envoyé ? L. C. (avocat) : Le huis clos n’est pas un vase clos. Cette décision était attendue. La résonance était inéluctable. On parle d’une affaire inédite [qui a sidéré, bouleversé et traumatisé toute une société](https://www.lepoint.fr/debats/begle-professeur-decapite-ce-sera-eux-ou-nous-17-10-2020-2396852_2.php). Or, il est clair qu’il manque dans les peines prononcées une dimension punitive vraiment dissuasive pour les justiciables du monde scolaire : élèves, enseignants, encadrants, parents d’élèves… Et pour cause, la peine prononcée à l’encontre de Zohra* – menteuse obstinée et calomnieuse acharnée sans qui Samuel Paty serait encore en vie – ressemble plus à une réprimande indulgente qu’à une sanction électrochoc. Il faut quand même se rendre compte de ce qu’on leur annonce : la justice française accorde un sursis intégral à la première responsable de la cabale islamiste ayant mené à la décapitation d’un professeur ! C’est incompréhensible. La perspective d’une fermeté pénale absolue en cas d’atteinte à un cheveu d’un professeur devrait être une certitude pour tout collégien, alors que la France est confrontée à [une flambée de violences dans l’enceinte de l’école](https://www.lepoint.fr/education/un-eleve-interpelle-pour-des-menaces-de-mort-contre-son-professeur-sur-instagram-18-12-2023-2547427_3584.php). L’occasion est manquée… (…) L. C. : La question de l’empathie à l’égard de la famille Paty a, en effet, été scrutée. Et pour cause, le point commun de ces adolescents a été leur manque abyssal d’empathie à l’égard d’un professeur, qu’ils appréciaient par ailleurs. Il y a eu chez eux une dissociation mentale sidérante entre leur intérêt égoïste immédiat et le mal causé à ce dernier. Or, trois ans plus tard, on est bien forcé de déplorer la persistance d’une empathie sélective pour certains d’entre eux… [https://www.fdesouche.com/2023/12/28/lavocat-de-mickaelle-paty-soeur-de-samuel-il-faut-quand-meme-se-rendre-compte-que-la-justice-francaise-a-accorde-un-sursis-integral-a-la-premiere-responsable-de-la-cabale-islamiste-ay/](https://www.fdesouche.com/2023/12/28/lavocat-de-mickaelle-paty-soeur-de-samuel-il-faut-quand-meme-se-rendre-compte-que-la-justice-francaise-a-accorde-un-sursis-integral-a-la-premiere-responsable-de-la-cabale-islamiste-ay/)",

The severe drought area covers Boston and the rest of Suffolk County as well as parts of Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk counties.\nThe rest of the state is experiencing moderate drought or “abnormally dry” conditions, with the exception of southeastern Mass., including the Cape, which has received a substantial amount of rain over the past three months, according to the Monitor.\nAdvertisement\nFirefighters across the state have been battling brush fires for more than a week, according to state officials.\nAccording to forecasters at the weather service, only a “smattering of rain” is expected in eastern Massachusetts in the near future.\nHowever, there will be a noticeable drop in temperature starting later Friday that will be very apparent on Saturday and through the rest of the weekend, which is expected to be sunny and dry.\n“A significant cool down is on the way for the weekend as high temperatures will drop 20+ degrees from Friday to Saturday!” forecasters posted on X. “Don’t get used to it, though, as another abnormally warm period arrives for the middle of next week.”\nA significant cool down is on the way for the weekend as high temperatures will drop 20+ degrees from Friday to Saturday!
