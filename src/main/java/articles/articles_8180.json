He scored 22 points and made multiple timely buckets. Collin Sexton and Lauri Markkanen combined for 50 to lead the way for Utah.\nheading back home 🏡\n[#TakeNote] [pic.twitter.com/1ASaUb2cLa]\n— Utah Jazz (@utahjazz)\n[December 29, 2023]\nFirst Quarter\nThe Pelicans were without guard CJ McCollum when they lost the back-to-back games in Salt Lake City.\nMcCollum looked to get revenge for those losses as he got out to a hot start.\nThe Pelicans big three of McCollum, Zion Williamson, and Brandon Ingram combined for 18 of their first 22 points.\nFor the Jazz, it took just five minutes for all five starters to get on the board.\nCJ McCollum and Zion Williamson are carrying the load for New Orleans early in the first. Utah responded with a balanced attack and trail by one halfway through the quarter.\n1Q 6:24\n[@PelicansNBA]19 [@utahjazz]18 [#TakeNote]\n— KSL Sports (@kslsports)\n[December 29, 2023]\nThe Jazz were able to stay within striking distance despite the offensive fireworks from the Pelicans.\nIronically, right after Zion Williamson subbed out, New Orleans went on a 10-0 run with their best player on the sideline.\nA Jazz timeout was followed by a scoring bunch that brought Utah back within three points.\nJordan Clarkson and John Collins led in scoring after one with 7 points each.\nNot a bad quarter from the Jazz by any means. They weathered the Zion and CJ storm and combated the Pelicans 70% from the field by shooting 65%. Down two going into the second.\n[#TakeNote]\n— KSL Sports (@kslsports)\n[December 29, 2023]\nUtah trailed by two, 39-37, after the first quarter.\nSecond Quarter\nAfter blistering hot shooting from both sides in the first, Smoothie King Center cooled down in the second.\nUtah and New Orleans both shot 33% from the field to start the quarter.\nIt seemed like the Pelicans had an answer for everything the Jazz threw at them.\nWhenever Utah threatened to take the lead, New Orleans splashed a three or got an easy look at the basket.\nThe Pelicans cooled off a bit in the second but so did the Jazz. Utah trails by two with six minutes left before halftime.\n[#TakeNote]\n— KSL Sports (@kslsports)\n[December 29, 2023]\nEven though Lauri Markkanen wasn’t playing his best, the Jazz stayed competitive.\nThe lack of production from the all-star wasn’t even really noticeable until late in the second quarter.\nUtah went cold and allowed a 12-3 run in the closing minutes of the half.\nThis put New Orleans up by ten with a minute left.\nA 12-3 run at the end of the half put the Jazz down eight. CJ McCollum and Zion Williamson combined for 27 first-half points. Markkanen leads the way for Utah with 10.\nHALFTIME\n[@PelicansNBA]59 [@utahjazz]51 [#TakeNote]\n— KSL Sports (@kslsports)\n[December 29, 2023]\nKelly Olynyk stopped the bleeding with a putback and the Jazz trailed by eight at the break, 59-51.\nThird Quarter\nSexton came out with a vengeance after the half, scoring nine of the Jazz’s first 11 points.\nThe Young Bull’s scoring run brought Utah back within one point.\nA corner three from Walker Kessler tied the game at 65. After a DNP Coach’s Decision against the Spurs, Talen Horton-Tucker subbed in and gave the Jazz their first lead since the first quarter.\nJazz take their first lead since 20-19 behind a scoring explosion from Collin Sexton who scored 9 of Utah’s first 11 in the half.\n3Q 7:24\n[@utahjazz]66 [@PelicansNBA]65 [#TakeNote] [pic.twitter.com/blsTJOeoyz]\n— KSL Sports (@kslsports)\n[December 29, 2023]\nThe difference in three-point shooting started to become apparent in the third quarter.\nThe Pelicans were able to get back out in front when behind and build on their lead when ahead thanks to a surplus of positive shooters.\nUtah shot under 30% from behind the arc through three quarters while New Orleans shot over 40%.\nThe Jazz’s struggles from three told the tale in the third as they took a lead but were unable to keep up with the Pelicans shooting and fell back behind.\n3Q\n[@PelicansNBA]81 [@utahjazz]76 [#TakeNote]\n— KSL Sports (@kslsports)\n[December 29, 2023]\nUtah made up some ground and trailed by five going into the final quarter, 81-76.\nFourth Quarter\nAfter three easy looks at the rim to start the fourth for New Orleans, the Jazz took a timeout as they found themselves down 10.\nUtah responded with a 7-0 run.\nNew Orleans put the Jazz in a tough position on defense. They showed that they could bury shots from deep but also had an 18-point advantage in the paint.\nPelicans have done a great job of bending but not breaking. Every Jazz run has come to a quick halt seemingly right before they can take a lead.\n4Q 6:00\n[@PelicansNBA]97 [@utahjazz]90 [#TakeNote]\n— KSL Sports (@kslsports)\n[December 29, 2023]\nAfter the Pelicans went back up by double-digits, Sexton came in for the rescue with back-to-back triples.\nWith three minutes left, Utah trailed by one, 99-98.\nIn the final stretch, the Jazz buckled down on defense and forced multiple deflections. Unfortunately, the Pelicans bailed themselves out with contested makes from three on consecutive possessions.\nUtah wasn’t out of it yet though. They trailed by four with a minute left.\nThe Jazz were unable to complete the comeback and fell to New Orleans, 112-105.\nSign up for the new Jazz Notes newsletter!

    "text": "I’m hoping someone understands the situation better than I do. Twitter/X is changing their terms of service tomorrow, and it sounds like they will be using AI to train on your data (perhaps taking copyright too), with no way to opt out – that’s what I’m seeking clarity on.\nAdding to the confusion, is a checkbox to opt out of Grok under the Privacy settings, that specifically says it won’t train on AI. That option has been there for at least a month, and some people think the new TOS superseeds that checkbox, thus making it pointless.\nIs deleting posts and content the only option for a hint of protection? Thanks for any thoughts.\nI wouldn’t be surprised if the only way to opt-out is to stop using X…but it probably will still have access to all your data to use however it likes even if you close your account (Meta does the same thing, by the way).\nIn any case, whether or not a site’s TOS allows AI training doesn’t matter much from a privacy perspective. AI builders scrape data from all across the Internet with most not caring about copyrights or target sites’ TOS. If something is accessible online, an AI is going to slurp it up at some point.\nA notorious example is how Clearview AI—and this predates the even hungrier generative AIs—built up its database of images:",

    "text": "'Men don’t know how to keep space. They touch you inappropriately, they talk to you inappropriately, and are in your space inappropriately,' the woman blasted the man in the video. Editor's note: This article was originally published on August 3, 2021. It has since been updated. Most men have little to no regard for invading personal space when it comes to women. It is common to see them come uncomfortably close to women and \"accidentally\" brush against their bodies and act as if nothing happened. The chances of them doing this to another man is minuscule. A woman's personal space is something they think is negotiable. When women do object they try to gaslight them into thinking they are overreacting for no reason. But calling out this predatory behavior and holding men accountable is necessary. A woman is being praised for doing just that in a [TikTok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@haleymcquinn_/video/6989263586954661125?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1). Haley McQuinn managed to capture her friend, Calla calling out a man for coming in way too close to her and then inappropriately touching her despite being told not to. The video captioned: \"Normalize checking men\" has racked up over two million views. In the video, an unidentified man has his chair placed right behind Calla's and has his arm resting on the back of her chair. It is obvious from the very beginning that she is not comfortable with the man's proximity to her. Her expression and body language are telling of how she is uncomfortable. As the man continues to claim Calla's personal space, his elbow touches her back. She immediately recoils from his reach and the man dramatically and mockingly states: “Oh, s***! I touched her again!” He tries to act like the victim in the situation and still does not back off. When Calla continues to show her discomfort he tries to badly explain himself saying he was talking to the girl sitting next to her. The girl then points out that he was indeed talking about her. An exasperated Calla then tells him off. “You were talking to her about me and talking about my trauma because, yes, for the last f***ing 30 years of my life [men] don’t know how to keep space. They touch you inappropriately, they talk to you inappropriately, and they be [sic] in your motherf***ing space inappropriately,” she stated. It is unsure what followed but other TikTok users were frustrated with the man's behavior as well. One person wrote: \"I cannot stand people that act like him! ‘I don’t have an issue with me getting in YOUR personal space, you should relax’.\" Another person commented: \"Triggered. When they gaslight you and try to make you feel like you’re overreacting for normally reacting to their disrespect.\" One user noted that the guy knew exactly what he was doing while others stated the six-feet social distancing rule should continue even after the pandemic is over. \"I just know someone out there thinks she’s dramatic,\" another person noted, \"it’s called respecting personal space and education. How were some of y’all raised.\" Calla [stitched](https://www.tiktok.com/@callalatrice/video/6989355277124373766?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1) the video and captioned it: \"So obtuse...obviously can't read facial expressions or body language.\" People usually have an invisible bubble a few feet around them that comprises their personal space. This space varies in size depending on gender, culture, the relationship between the people, and the setting, among other factors. Unsurprisingly, men occupy more space than women. A woman's boundaries are not respected and are invaded more easily. According to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/he-speaks-she-speaks/201005/the-incredible-hulk-and-the-shrinking-violet-women-men-and-personal), a woman's territory is overtaken more quickly than a man's. Linda Manning, a communication professor, says it is possible for women to \"grow\" their space using markers. \"I suppose it was my nonverbal way of saying, ‘I'm in charge here because look at how much territory I have marked with my possessions,'\" she explained. Understand that when men invade a woman's personal space it is never about sex. It is all about power.— Chekhov’s Gin (@_pea_green_boat) Teach other men that.

    "text": "Tennessee wound up losing 14 scholarship players to the NCAA transfer portal off its 2024 football roster, but running back Dylan Sampson had been the lone junior to leave the Volunteers early for the NFL.\nThen the obvious happened.\nEdge rusher James Pearce, who has been projected as NFL first-round material since the end of his sophomore season, announced late Wednesday night that he would be forgoing his senior year with the Vols. The 6-foot-5, 243-pounder from Charlotte, North Carolina, revealed his intentions via a social media video roughly two hours before the NFL's deadline for underclassmen to declare.\nTwo mock drafts released Wednesday project Pearce to be among the first 20 selections, with CBS predicting him 14th overall to Indianapolis and The Athletic pegging him 19th to Tampa Bay.\nPearce's 2023 season consisted of only three starts, but he played in all 13 games and racked up 28 tackles, 14.5 tackles for loss, 10 sacks and 16 quarterback pressures. He was the highest-graded defensive end in the Southeastern Conference that season at 90.9, according to Pro Football Focus, and he made the most of the Citrus Bowl stage against Iowa.\nIn the 35-0 thrashing of the Hawkeyes, Pearce tallied 1.5 sacks, forced a fumble and had a 52-yard interception return for a touchdown.\nPearce received far more attention this past season from opposing offenses but still compiled 38 tackles, 13 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks and 10 quarterback hurries. He played just a handful of snaps in Tennessee's early season routs of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and Kent State and addressed his downtick in lost-yardage stops midway through the season.\n\"It's my job to play in the scheme of the defense, and the coaches are going to dial up what we need to win,\" Pearce said. \"I feel like everybody is playing great and that we're playing as one, and that's what has us confident. We're just going to keep getting after it.\n\"Numbers are cool, but you like to win more than the numbers. I said that before the season started.\"\nWith only Monday night's championship game between Notre Dame and Ohio State remaining in the 2024 season, Tennessee ranks sixth nationally in total defense (having allowed an average of 293.2 yards a game) and seventh in scoring defense (16.1 points allowed per contest).\nContact David Paschall at dpaschall@timesfreepress.com.",

    "title": "Canadian sentenced to life in prison for 'terrorist' murders of Muslim family - Breitbart",
    "text": "A white supremacist committed terrorism when he ran down a Muslim family out for an evening stroll, a Canadian judge said Thursday as she sentenced him to life in prison for the murders. The ruling is the first in Canada to make a link between white supremacy and terrorism in a murder case. Nathaniel Veltman, 23, was convicted in November of four counts of first degree or premeditated murder, and one count of attempted murder in the killing of three generations of the Afzaal family that also left a young boy orphaned. He acknowledged striking the family with his pickup truck in June 2021 in London, Ontario. The prosecution argued at trial that he sought to intimidate and terrorize Muslims, while the defense said he’d suffered a mental decline — which did not, however, meet the requirements for an insanity plea. His lawyers also said he was in “a state of extreme confusion” after consuming hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms that weekend. Judge Renee Pomerance, of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, said Veltman “had planned a murderous rampage for months and took steps to ensure that he would kill as many Muslims in this brutal manner as he could.” Recalling Veltman’s statements to police, she said: “He wanted to intimidate the Muslim community. He wanted to follow in the footsteps of other mass killers, and he wanted to inspire others to commit murderous acts.” “I find that the offender’s actions constitute terrorist activity,” she concluded. Outside the courthouse, extended members of the Afzaal family expressed their grief, describing “a hollowness” and “scars.” “The verdict will not bring back what was stolen. It will not mend the fractured pieces of our lives, our identity and our security,” said relative Tabina Bukhari. But, she added, “the terrorism designation acknowledges the hate that fueled this fire, the ugliness that took the lives of Talat, Salman, Madiha and Yumnah.” Defense lawyer Christopher Hicks, meanwhile, told reporters he is considering appealing both the conviction and sentence. The jury in the almost 10-week trial heard Veltman had penned a “terrorist manifesto,” found on his computer, in which he espoused white nationalism and described his hate for Muslims. The judge noted that he wore “combat gear” including a helmet and bulletproof vest during the attack. Veltman passed the Afzaal family on a London street on that warm Sunday evening, turned his newly purchased truck with a heavy grill guard around, jumped the curb and slammed into them. Salman Afzaal, 46, his wife Madiha Salman, 44, their 15-year-old daughter Yumnah and her grandmother Talat Afzaal, 74, were killed. A nine-year-old boy orphaned in the ramming suffered serious injuries. The slaying was the deadliest anti-Muslim attack in Canada since a shooting at a mosque in Quebec City in 2017 that left six dead. The perpetrator of that shooting was not accused of terrorism.",
