    "text": "2023-12-28 22:00:29 Argentina’s largest union has called for a general strike to protest against new President Javier Milei’s radical economic reforms. The strike is scheduled to take place on January 24th, as the CGT trade union federation announced on Thursday. Union leader Héctor Daer also announced a protest demonstration in front of the Argentine parliament during the debate on Milei’s first draft laws. Milei’s decrees and draft laws for comprehensive economic deregulation were “targeted against the entire society,” Daer said. Milei wants to concentrate all political power “with the president.” When he took office on December 10th, Milei promised the heavily indebted South American country a “shock therapy”. First, the ultra-liberal right-wing populist introduced a decree with which he wants to change or abolish 350 existing laws, for example in tenancy and labor law. In order to reduce government spending, 7,000 jobs in the public sector are to be cut. Milei, a 53-year-old political newcomer, has taken over Latin America’s third-largest economy in the midst of a severe economic crisis: Inflation has risen to more than 160 percent and more than 40 percent of the population lives in poverty. 1703801412 #General #strike #Argentine #President #Milei",

O alerta foi dado pelo Centro de Previsão do Clima Espacial dos Estados Unidos. Segundo a agência, a tempestade geomagnética deve chegar ao nível G4, o segundo mais alto em uma escala de cinco níveis, e os efeitos disso estão previstos para chegar à Terra entre esta sexta-feira (9) até o próximo domingo (12). [+ Tempestade solar pode causar apagão em 2024](https://sbtnews.sbt.com.br/noticia/mundo/265819-tempestade-solar-pode-causar-apagao-em-2024) De acordo com a Administração Nacional Oceânica e Atmosférica (NOAA), desde quarta-feira (8) o sol tem produzido fortes explosões solares, que resultaram em cinco explosões de plasma. Cada uma delas pode conter bilhões de toneladas de plasma solar. A NOAA chama isso de evento incomum, apontando que as explosões parecem estar associadas a uma mancha solar com 16 vezes o diâmetro da Terra. Uma tempestade geomagnética extrema em 2003 cortou a energia na Suécia e danificou transformadores de energia na África do Sul. Interesse nas redes O tema virou assunto nas redes sociais nesta sexta-feira (10). De acordo com os dados apresentados pelo Google Trends, houve um aumento repentino de interesse sobre a tempestade solar.",

    "text": "【基本案情】　湖北省宜都市紧邻长江，水资源丰富，素有“楚蜀咽喉”“三峡门城”“鄂西门户”之称，域内白溪河属长江水系。近年来，宜都市畜禽养殖业蓬勃发展，畜禽养殖场达600余家，但是部分养殖场违规处置污染物的现象较为突出，造成河流水体被污染、富营养化，产生的恶臭气体也严重破坏了乡村人居环境。\n　　2023年8月12日，宜都市检察院接到群众反映，称宜都市王家畈镇某村有生猪养殖户向白溪河直排污染物。该院公益诉讼检察官随即前往白溪河上游三溪口处实地核查，发现大量黑色粪污沿白溪河顺流而下，恶臭难闻。2023年8月16日，该院对此线索立案调查，并商请该市生态环境部门协助取样检测。经检测，白溪河下游水体中氨氮含量为1.72mg/L，超出《地表水环境质量标准》（GB3838-2002）氨氮含量评价标准。\n　　因涉案地属于喀斯特地貌，山高林密，畜禽养殖户多，排污隐蔽性强，调查取证难度高、专业性强，宜都市检察院再次商请该市生态环境部门提供专业支持。经调取、分析、比对王家畈镇某村生猪养殖户出栏数、化粪池设计库容、粪污消纳台账等数据，工作人员发现白溪河上游三溪口处2家生猪养殖场的粪污处理数据异常。结合该情况，检察官进一步开展了实地勘查，并询问了养殖场负责人，最终查明这2家生猪养殖场利用喀斯特地貌溶洞私设暗管、直排粪污破坏生态环境的违法事实。\n　　2023年8月25日，宜都市检察院向该市生态环境部门制发检察建议，建议其依法履行水生态环境保护监管职责，加大对畜禽养殖污染的行政执法力度；向该市农业农村局制发检察建议，建议其依法履行畜禽养殖废弃物综合利用监管职责；向王家畈镇政府制发检察建议，建议其协助有关部门做好畜禽养殖污染防治工作。\n　　与此同时，宜都市检察院联合宜昌市生态环境部门开展白溪河畜禽养殖污染问题调研工作，发现白溪河上游周边畜禽养殖项目空间布局规划不合理、畜禽养殖场过于集中，养殖场产生的粪污超过周边农田生产需求，加上公共粪污消纳池不足，造成粪污还田与粪污库容之间的周期性供需矛盾较为突出，养殖场违法处置污染物现象时有发生。对此，该院组织召开联席会议，推动相关行政机关形成监管合力，合理规划畜禽养殖项目空间布局，加强畜禽养殖废弃物综合利用工作，推动问题综合治理。\n　　在检察建议的督促下，相关行政机关依法履职，积极整改，联合开展白溪河畜禽养殖污染专项整治行动，并按期书面回复。宜昌市生态环境局宜都市分局在查清事实的基础上，依法责令上述2家生猪养殖场对暗管直排粪污行为进行整改，并对2家养殖场负责人作出行政处罚，同时加大对白溪河周边畜禽养殖场的巡查力度，逐步提升养殖户的守法经营意识。宜都市农业农村局对2家生猪养殖场下达整改通知书，促使其正常运转粪污消纳设施，及时清运生猪粪污；同时对全市畜禽养殖场粪污消纳设施运转情况进行专项检查，下达整改通知书187份，推进畜禽粪污资源化利用项目建设。王家畈镇政府落实属地监管责任，新添吸粪车、新建公共消纳池，优化现存畜禽养殖项目的空间布局，并逐步迁移白溪河沿岸规模化畜禽养殖场。\n　　经综合治理，白溪河沿岸的畜禽粪污直排行为得到有效遏制，河面颜色由黑转绿，粪污异味消散不见。经检测，白溪河下游水体中氨氮含量降为0.622mg/L，水质明显好转。2023年11月，宜都市检察院开展“回头看”活动，受邀参加的人大代表、“益心为公”志愿者等均对白溪河整改成效予以认可。2024年，该案入选最高人民检察院、生态环境部联合发布的检察监督与生态环境执法协同推进长江保护修复典型案例。\n　　（整理：本报记者蒋长顺　通讯员薛峰）\n　　【评析】　随着规模化畜禽养殖业的快速发展，地方畜禽养殖污染问题日益凸显。检察机关针对个别规模化畜禽养殖场私设暗管逃避监管、违法排污污染长江水系河流的行为，依法履职，督促生态环境、农业农村等部门及属地政府加大行政执法力度，依法协同整治违法排污行为，改善农村人居环境，助力长江流域水环境保护。此案办理主要有以下三个方面的经验值得总结：\n　　一是府检联动突破技术壁垒。为有效破解调查取证中的技术性障碍，弥补行政公益诉讼调查取证保障性措施缺乏的现实问题，检察机关通过府检联动协作机制商请生态环境部门提供专业支持，包括开展联合调查、协助进行水质检测、及时固定水体污染证据等，实现了法律监督与行政执法的优势互补，有效保障了案件办理质效，是构建长江协同共治大保护格局的生动实践。\n　　二是数据导向破解调查困局。面对涉案地点属于喀斯特地貌、山高林密，排污隐蔽性强，养殖户众多、难以锁定具体违法行为人的办案难题，检察机关及时调整调查思路，通过调取、分析、比对生猪养殖户出栏数、化粪池设计库容、粪污消纳台账等数据，在发现数据异常的基础上结合调查笔录等间接证据，形成完整证据链条，协助生态环境部门查明2家规模以上生猪养殖场私设暗管直排粪污的违法事实，有效提高了调查效率和精准性。\n　　三是深入调研推动治理转型。面对畜禽养殖污染乱象，为实现由“点上突破”到“面上提升”的治理效能升级，检察机关联合生态环境部门针对性开展调研，在系统梳理乱象成因的基础上组织召开联席会议，将调研成果及时转化为现实可行的治理方案，凝聚行政监管合力，推动全市开展畜禽养殖污染专项整治行动，有效助力畜禽养殖污染问题从“被动应急”到“主动防控”的治理转型。\n　　（点评人：湖北省宜都市人民检察院副检察长刘源）",

    "text": "The Vivekananda Rock Memorial, a serene retreat imbued with spiritual significance, stands majestically in the southern part of India. This iconic site, where Swami Vivekananda envisioned Ek Bharat, Shresht Bharat, recently hosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his hectic campaign schedule. Upon his arrival in Kanyakumari, the Prime Minister's first stop was the revered Bhagavathi Amman temple. Clad in traditional attire, he engaged in prayers, circumambulated the sanctum, performed aarti, and received prasad, embodying the deep spiritual connection of the visit. Later, at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, PM Modi commenced a 45-hour meditation session at 6:45 PM on Thursday. During this period of silence, he will sustain himself solely on coconut water, grape juice, and other liquids. This meditative retreat not only offers the Prime Minister a respite from his demanding duties but also underscores the Memorial’s enduring symbolism of national unity and the vision for a developed India. The Rock Memorial, with its tranquil beauty and historical significance, continues to inspire and invoke a sense of profound reflection and patriotism.",
