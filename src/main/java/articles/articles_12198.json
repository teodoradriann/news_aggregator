    "text": "La armonía del lugar que se habita influye en el bienestar y en el ánimo, es parte de esa estampa que seduce a la mirada, inspira y queda en la memoria como grato recuerdo. Si de armonía se habla, es necesario mencionar la belleza de cada espacio, la naturaleza vista desde los verdes que definen la existencia de árboles, plantas silvestres, ornamentales y, además, como rasgo distintivo, la higiene. “…la belleza en lo que nos rodea ayuda a la vida” afirmó el más universal de los cubanos, quien también en la Revista Universal de México, el 13 de noviembre de 1875, había catalogado a la belleza como un dulcísimo poder. La pretensión de que San José de las Lajas sea una hermosa ciudad, implica aunar todas las maneras para procurar su armonía, esa donde la belleza anide desde la higiene, el cuidado de cada espacio y la responsabilidad ciudadana para que sea este terruño, lo que muchos recuerdan, un lugar limpio. “Hallamos algo bello, y hallamos algo de nosotros mismos.” escribió José Martí y, en esa afirmación está implícita la relación que establecemos con el sitio que habitamos, ese pacto de cuidado y protección con el entorno, esa forma de salvar el equilibrio que propicia un ambiente sano. La armonía de un lugar a ojos vista es alimento para el espíritu, es la belleza abrigada por la higiene y el cuidado, es ese confort natural que nos merecemos y que no deben empañar basureros ni hedores. San José de las Lajas puede ser una ciudad bella, más que una utopía es un gran desafío que vale la pena enfrentar con todas las fuerzas.",

    "title": "Phil Collins, 73, Shares Heartbreaking Health Update After Retiring From Playing the Drums in 2022: 'To Not Be Able to Do That Is a Shock'",
    "text": "By Jaclyn Roth ,\n46 minutes ago Phil Collins shared some rare insight into what he's been up to in the past few years. mega Phil Collins , who joined the band Genesis in the 1970s and retired from playing the drums in March 2022, is giving fans a rare glimpse inside his life at 73 years old.\n\"It’s still kind of sinking in a bit…\" the musician said in the documentary Phil Collins: Drummer First , which was released on Wednesday, December 18, and filmed in 2022. \"I’ve spent all my life playing drums. To suddenly not be able to do that is a shock.\"\nPhil Collins retired from the drums in 2022. mega The \"You'll Be in My Heart\" crooner , who has been playing drums since he was 5 years old, said playing the instrument \"has taken its toll on my hands, legs.\"\n\"If I can’t do what I did as well as I did it, I’d rather relax and not do anything,\" the Tarzan composer continued. \"If I wake up one day and I can hold a pair of drumsticks, then I’ll have a crack at it. But I just feel like I’ve used up my air miles.\"\nPhil Collins' son Nic filled in for him when he couldn't play the drums. mega The star's son Nic, who is a rock drummer known for playing with his father's band, Genesis, and his own band, Better Strangers, also gave more details about how the U.K. native is holding up.\n\"Musicians, people in bands in general had this thought that they were invincible,\" he said.\n\"I think that's really what it is with my dad is just this kind of sense of you're a drummer, you're invincible, you do what you do. But you don't know it's gonna take a toll in the long run,\" he continued.\nPhil Collins hasn't released an album since 2010. mega Ever since Genesis wrapped up their farewell tour in 2022, Phil has been pretty quiet, but according to Simon Napier-Bell , who has managed the likes of like Wham!, Sinead O’Connor , The Yardbirds and Asia, he believes new tunes from the artist should be out at some point in the future.\n“THE MARQUEE MOVIE…Yesterday we filmed Phil Collins at his house by Lake Geneva. He was in top form, full of wicked stories, hugely fun. And he’s just had his studio revamped. For sure, before too long we’re going to hear some new music,\" he captioned a photo of himself with Phil earlier this year.\nPhil Collins said it's a 'shock' to not be able to play the drums anymore. mega Phil hasn't released a new album since 2010's covers album, Going Back . When he toured solo from 2017 to 2019 and with Genesis from 2021 to 2022, he was unable to play the drums, which is why his son Nic filled in for him.\nPhil Collins: Drummer First is available to stream on YouTube.\n1",

    "text": "-- Timeline has reached £10 billion in assets under management, underscoring its rapid growth and transformative impact on financial planning through its integrated, adviser-focused technology ecosystem.\nPhoto 1: Timeline's CEO & Founder Abraham Okusanya and some of his Executive team (CCO Ed Carey, COO Karthica Underwood, CIO Nicki Hinton-Jones, CMO Tom Newbould, CFO Richard Preston, and CPO Thomas Hogg)\nTimeline, a pioneering integrated technology ecosystem designed for financial advisers, today announced it has surpassed £10 billion in assets under management (AUM). This milestone marks a significant step in Timeline’s rapid expansion within the UK financial services sector and underscores its growing influence in modernising financial planning.\nSince launching, Timeline has delivered a suite of adviser-centric tools, evidence-based investment portfolios, and streamlined workflows that collectively aim to enhance the efficiency and scalability of financial advice practices. The firm’s achievement of £10 billion in AUM is a significant validation of this mission.\n“This isn’t just about numbers,” says Abraham Okusanya, Founder and CEO of Timeline. “It’s £10 billion of people’s hopes and dreams. We don’t take the trust that these people have placed in us lightly. We’re working to help them to plan, invest and retire with confidence, through an army of trusted financial planners.”\nHe continues: “Our journey to this point and beyond is about more than amassing assets, it’s about creating meaningful impact, helping advice firms thrive, enabling better client outcomes, and making financial planning more accessible, efficient and effective.”\nTimeline's journey to £10 billion in Assets Under Management has significantly impacted both the UK's tech and financial services sectors, creating 77 jobs. Their platform has also allowed 650 advice firms to effectively grow and scale their businesses.\nTo empower individuals in managing their financial futures, Timeline has facilitated the creation of 60,000 financial plans. Additionally, they have served 45,000 end clients through low-cost portfolios, making quality investing more accessible to a broader audience. This approach has also led to savings of up to £35 million in fees when compared to traditional Managed Portfolio Services (MPS) offerings.\nAdvisers using Timeline’s platform have completed 13,622 attitude-to-risk questionnaires, allowing for more tailored and suitable financial plans.\nThe platform has streamlined administrative processes with over 2,500 digital Letters of Authority submitted, significantly reducing friction for advisers and clients. Notably, Timeline’s PensionLab integration has resulted in an 80% time saving on LOA administration alone.\nPromoting financial literacy has been another key focus, with over 104,000 educational video views recorded.\nTimeline has also invested in the future of the profession by sponsoring a Financial Planning degree at Coventry University and funded more than 30 trainee tickets for Adviser 3.0, their flagship conference, demonstrating a commitment to nurturing the next generation of financial planners.\nTimeline’s growth trajectory positions it among the fastest-expanding discretionary fund managers in the UK, with a clear emphasis on digital integration and evidence-based investment strategies aligned to clients’ long-term financial goals.\n“The future of financial advice is digital, integrated and human-centred,” adds Okusanya. “We’re proud of the legacy we’re building - and this is just the beginning.”\nFor further information on Timeline’s platform and its adviser ecosystem, visit www.timeline.co.\nAbout Timeline\nTimeline is the integrated ecosystem built for modern financial advisers.
