    "text": "To make way for the expansion of Avengers Campus and a possible new bathroom facility, the guest walkway leading to the area from Cars Land has now been closed.\nWalkway Closed Between Avengers Campus and Cars Land\nAs we reported last week, the walkway connecting Avengers Campus to Cars Land on the side of Disney California Adventure has now been closed.\nThe path in question has one entrance on the right side of Cars Land between Radiator Springs Curios and Luigi’s Rollickin’ Roadsters. The opposite end of the walkway placed guests in the back corner of Avengers Campus, between the Ancient Sanctum and the Avengers Vault store. The Ancient Sanctum used to be the home of the “Dr. Strange: Mysteries of the Mystic Arts” show before it was cut last year.\nBoth sides of the path are now blocked completely with construction walls. The walls are painted differently on either side to match the theming of the respective lands. The walls on the Avengers Campus side of the walkway are bright blue.\nThe edges of the walls are lined with additional green tarps to prevent guests from slipping around the corner.\nThe closure of this walkway is temporary due to construction work, but it is not expected to reopen until sometime next summer.\nOn the opposite side of the walkway, the path in Cars Land has also been blocked with construction walls. These are painted a bright brown color to match the fence on the left.\nUnlike the walls in Avengers Campus, the Cars Land walls extend all the way around the back of the gardens. None of the work taking place around the walkway will be visible to guests as a result.\nWith this walkway closed, guests wanting to reach Avengers Campus from Cars Land will need to head back down the main walkway to the edge of Pacific Warf and take the larger path on the right into the campus.\nDisney has announced a planned expansion of Avengers Campus in Disney California Adventure that is expected to double the size of the land as part of the wider DisneylandForward expansion project. Avengers Campus will receive two new attractions called Avengers: Infinity Defense and Stark Flight Lab. This guest walkway is also rumored to rumored to receive a new bathroom facility, though Disney has not confirmed it yet.\nWhat do you think of the Avengers Campus expansion project? Let us know in the comments.\nFor more Disneyland Resort news and info, follow Disneyland News Today on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. For Disney Parks news worldwide, visit WDWNT.",

Leftover showers will taper off Saturday afternoon. SYLVA, N.C. (WLOS) — The Sylva Board of Commissioners voted to deny a parade permit for Sylva Pride on Thursday, March 21. During the morning meeting, commissioners expressed concerns about the logistics of the parade. Only one commissioner, Natalie Newman, voted against denying the permit application. They said they were worried about closing off roads, including Main Street, and that they are trying to push larger events to happen at Bridge Park instead. SYLVA TOWN COUNCIL NARROWLY APPROVES CONTROVERSIAL PANHANDLING ORDINANCE Sylva Pride has held its annual event for the last three years, which includes live music, drag shows and the parade down Main Street. Last year, the Town of Sylva had changed its permit requirements, that in order to close any streets within town limits, the event must be town-sponsored. The first two Sylva Pride events took place prior to the permitting rules change. On Friday, March 22, News 13 has reached out to Sylva Mayor Johnny Phillps for a comment on this decision, but he was unavailable. News 13 is speaking with Natalie Newman, the only commissioner who voted against denying the application, and a crew is working to get in touch with Sylva Pride to see what its plans are for the event moving forward. This story will be updated throughout the day with more details.",

    "text": "Joburg may face thirsty festive\nResidents plead with city as Joburg Water says it can’t guarantee supply\n[Koena Mashale](/authors/immigration)Journalist\nAs Christmas inches closer and the heatwave gets worse, Joburg Water says it can't guarantee there won't be any water supply interruptions this festive season.\n“This is because there are issues such as burst pipes that occur which are unplanned. However, Johannesburg Water does assure residents that the entity endeavours to respond to service delivery issues as timeously as possible,” said spokesperson Nolwazi Dhlamini.\nFor many Turfontein residents, having water constantly coming out of their taps is a pipe dream as they have been grappling with intermittent water supply since the beginning of the year.\nSpeaking to Sowetan, some residents said they had gone a week without water and would not be surprised if they spend Christmas with dry taps.\nInconsistencies of water takers in the area, having to pay for the water they don't get as well as the inconvenience of not being able to adhere to a strict hygiene regimen were other issues that added to their frustrations. “My bill [for water] would come up to R1,000 and yet I didn’t have water for half of the month. I pay for that but I also buy water because the tankers are unreliable,\" said resident Casper Sibanda.\n“We see leaking pipes in the streets, the water is flowing down the street but we don’t have water in our taps and we are suffering. Our children can’t bath, you can’t cook. I won’t be shocked if they were to say there’s no water during Christmas.”\nWhile the city has provided water tankers to the area, another resident, Lorraine Makgethe, said they were inconsistent, and that it was frustrating her. “I am at work when they come, and that’s if they are coming. We would go days without seeing one. Sometimes it’s like a shock when one comes by and people would flood them with their buckets,” she said.\nJohannesburg Water does assure residents that the entity endeavours to respond to service delivery issues as timeously as possible.Nolwazi Dhlamini\n“There was once a time when we went close to a whole month without water. I mean, half of the year was spent with me saying to my children, 'There’s no water’. Imagine a family of four bathing with water from a 2l bottle. My son gets out of the tub and I bathe with the water he bathed in. Not only is it unfair but it’s also costly. In a day, I refill five 2l bottles for R10 at least three times, and then we're still expected to pay the water bill?”\nJoburg Water attributes the water crisis to ageing infrastructure, financial constraints and population growth.\nWhile areas like Turfontein are the worst hit, others like Brixton and Crown Gardens have to contend with intermittent schedules.\nA Brixton businessman who asked to remain anonymous said they had received information from the councillor that they should expect no water in this coming weekend.\n“The councillor sent it in the group chat that the entire weekend there would be no water. Now I have to go collect water in buckets from my home where I have a jojo tank and bring it to the restaurant,” he said.\nThe man, who sells fast food, said the water issue was affecting his business negatively.\n“This water situation has been a problem because at some point I had inspectors asking why I had water in buckets, listing that as unsanitary. I told them I don’t have a choice because there was no water and they suggested I close on days like that. However, I can't; this is my income,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, Joburg Water CEO Ntshavheni Mukwevho said the city faced a backlog of R27bn for infrastructure upgrades and needs R3.1bn annually for the next decade.\nThe water entity has since proposed solutions such as repairing leaking reservoirs, building new facilities and tackling illegal water connections to deal with the crisis.\nAccording to Joburg Water, there are about 42 leaking reservoirs identified but only 11 are undergoing repairs.\nMeanwhile, in Turffontein, a 17-year-old boy carrying two buckets and a 2l container in a wheelbarrow he filled at a nearby warehouse, said to fill up one container cost R20 and he made at least five trips a day.\nHe said he lived with his mother and four brothers on the fifth floor of a multi-storey building that has no lift. “My mother doesn't make enough for us to have to go up and down and give the warehouse R20 five times. \"Sometimes we don't bathe, we don't even flush the toilet. I want water during Christmas so that it's easier for my family, especially my mother. Let us have water,” said the boy.\nAsked what was behind Turffontein's water issues, Dhlamini said she was not aware of the situation.\n\"Please provide more information that we can provide to the depot and they can investigate the matter. Please provide the reference numbers for the calls logged by the customers who are struggling with water supply, as well as street names and addresses so that the depot can have sufficient information to investigate,\" she said.\nSowetanLIVE\nWould you like to comment on this article?\nRegister (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\nPlease read our [Comment Policy](/pages/comments/) before commenting.",

    "text": "henry 发自 凹非寺\n量子位 | 公众号 QbitAI\nAI图像的水印技术要变天了！\n一款全新的去水印技术—— UnMarker ，能在 5分钟内 去除市面上 几乎所有 的AI图像水印。\n其中，谷歌水印工具HiDDeN已被 完全破解 ，SynthID也已被攻破79%！\nUnMarker在高效去除水印的同时，还保持了 较高的图像质量。\n目前，UnMarker已经在GitHub上免费开源，用户仅凭 消费级显卡 就可实现本地部署。\nUnMarker的出现，让原本被视为有效对抗AI造假的水印技术变得 不再可靠\nUnMarker创作者Andre Kassis表示：\n我就想知道，这些水印技术是否真像他们说得那么厉害。\nAI图像水印技术\n想知道UnMarker是怎么去除AI图像水印的，有必要先了解一下AI图像的水印是怎么回事。\n与一般直接在图片上打上品牌名的 显性水印 （Visible Watermark）不同，AI图像的水印主要是藏在 频谱特征 等图像深层信息中的 隐性水印 （Invisible Watermark）。\n频谱特征描述的是图像中像素值彼此之间的变化方式，由 频谱幅度（Magnitude） 频谱相位（Phase） 两个要素构成。\n当前，水印技术主要通过 修改频谱幅度这一频谱特征，在图像中嵌入隐性水印。\n举例来说，在下面人类和熊的两张图片中，虽然内容截然不同，但它们的 频谱幅度 分布模式却非常相似 ，而频谱相位却差别较大。\n由此，对内容高度敏感，在不同图像之间变化巨大的频谱相位就 不适合 作为可靠的通用载体来嵌入水印。\n相反，对具体的像素位置依赖性较低的频谱幅度成为了嵌入水印的 绝佳载体 ，其对裁剪、模糊、压缩等常见操作具有抵抗力，具备较好的鲁棒性。\n同时，我们还可以观察到图像的主体（人物和熊）与频谱幅度图中心的蓝色区域相对应，而图像的背景则对应着四周的橙色区域。\n这是因为，主体中平滑的区域，如衣物和毛发，拥有大片相同的色彩，导致 像素值变化较慢 ，属于频谱中的 低频部分\n而细节丰富的区域，如轮廓和纹理， 像素值变化较快 属于频谱中的高频部分。\n在Google的水印技术SynthID中，水印信息就被嵌入在图片的低频部分。\n不过，水印嵌入有时候会改变图像的输出，如下图所示。\n（注：上图从上到下按逆时针方向分别是：Google Imagen、Google SynthID，以及使用UnMarker去除水印后的图片）\n值得一提的是，在UnMarker之前，水印检测器并非通用工具。\n每一种水印都有自己专属的检测器，以及用来寻找该水印隐藏的频谱模式。\n而UnMarker以其强大的通用性，在不同的水印中实现了一种“通吃”的方法。\n那么，UnMarker是怎么去水印的呢？\n新的水印Killer\n就像上面提到的，不可见的水印存在于频谱幅度中。\n于是，UnMarker就专门针对这一点进行攻击。它忽略图像的像素值，直接修改整个图像的频谱信息，从而有效扰乱水印。\n正如Andre Kassis所说的：\nUnMarker并不试图寻找水印隐藏的位置，也不精准定位水印编码的频谱特征。它只需扰乱图像，就能去除水印。\n这种 忽略像素层，专攻频谱特征 的方式使UnMarker不限于单一种类的水印去除，能够应对多种水印。\n实验表明，根据AI图片使用的水印方法不同，UnMarker能移除 57% 100% 的可检测水印。\n其中HiDDeN和Yu2两种水印能被完全破解，而在Google SynthID中，UnMarker也成功移除了79%的水印。\n在一些较新的水印技术，如StegaStamp和Tree-Ring Watermarks中，UnMarker依旧表现不俗，能去除60%的水印。\n不过，UnMarker也非完美无缺，在去除水印的同时，往往也会对图像造成一些轻微的改动（如果你仔细观察上面女生的头发）。\n针对这一问题，Kassis表示，稍微裁剪图像可以取得更佳的去水印效果。\n在论文中，UnMarker被部署在一张40GB显存的Nvidia A100 GPU上，而据Kassis透露，在经过一些针对性的调整后，UnMarker应该也能在Nvidia RTX 5090这样的消费级显卡上运行。\n这将大大降低普通用户部署的成本和门槛。\nOne more thing\n最近，微软一项覆盖全球12500名参与者的研究表明，人们识别AI图像的平均 成功率仅为62%\n不客气地说，也就比瞎猜好一点。\n为了在“乱花渐欲迷人眼”的图像世界中“去伪存真”，水印作为一种解决方案就被提上了台前。\n例如，欧盟的《人工智能法案》要求大多数AI图像生成工具必须加入水印，许多拥有AI图像生成器的公司已经实施了水印，或计划在不久后实施。\n但就在大家寄望于水印技术的时候，像UnMarker这样的去水印技术已悄然登场。\n[1]https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-watermark-remover?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=hero&utm_campaign=2025-08-11&utm_content=hero1\n[2]https://github.com/andrekassis/ai-watermark\n[3]https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08363\n[4]https://x.com/yyolk/status/1948824571987329166\n— 完 —\n量子位 QbitAI · 头条号签约\n关注我们，第一时间获知前沿科技动态",

    "text": "Este lanche reduz o risco de síndrome metabólica nos jovens A condição – que aumenta o risco de diabetes e doenças cardiovasculares – está crescendo em todo o mundo, especialmente em adultos jovens A síndrome metabólica é uma das patologia que geram maior risco de [problemas cardiovasculares](https://catracalivre.com.br/saude-bem-estar/saude-dos-pes-ajuda-a-prever-doencas-cardiovasculares/) na população ocidental. Também conhecida como síndrome de resistência à insulina, ela é a soma de um conjunto de cinco distúrbios metabólicos. São eles: excesso de peso ou obesidade na região abdominal, níveis baixos de colesterol HDL (o bom), [pressão alta](https://catracalivre.com.br/saude-bem-estar/hipertensao-5-alimentos-que-combatem-a-pressao-alta/), níveis elevados de [glicose](https://catracalivre.com.br/saude-bem-estar/os-alimentos-que-causam-um-pico-de-glicose-no-seu-sangue/) no sangue (pré-diabetes ou diabetes) e níveis elevados de triglicerídeos. Cada um desses fatores separadamente já representa um risco cardiovascular significativo. Juntos, a probabilidade dispara. Assim como em outras condições, a alimentação é a chave da questão. Uma dieta rica em frutas e vegetais e pobre em [gordura saturada](https://catracalivre.com.br/saude-bem-estar/duas-gorduras-para-cortar-da-dieta-e-evitar-risco-de-doenca-cardiaca/) é capaz de prevenir a síndrome metabólica. Agora, um novo estudo publicado na revista [Nutrients](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients) sugere que comer um lanche todos os dias reduz significativamente o risco, sem necessidade de restrição calórica, em adultos jovens. Descobertas Os autores do estudo afirmam que esse lanche reduz o risco de síndrome metabólica melhorando a circunferência da cintura, os biomarcadores lipídicos e/ou os níveis de insulina. Eles falam, especificamente, de um consumo diário de frutas secas e nozes. No estudo randomizado de intervenção dietética, pesquisadores do Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Tennessee, Estados Unidos) recrutaram 84 homens e mulheres com idades entre 22 e 36 anos. Eles tinham pelo menos um fator de risco para síndrome metabólica no início do estudo. A maioria deles tinha sobrepeso ou [obesidade](https://catracalivre.com.br/saude-bem-estar/estudo-conclui-que-obesidade-tem-efeitos-parecidos-aos-do-alzheimer-no-cerebro/). Como o estudo foi feito? Os participantes consumiram 30 gramas de nozes mistas sem sal ou 28 gramas de um lanche rico em carboidratos, duas vezes ao dia. Ambos os lanches forneceram o mesmo número de calorias, proteínas, fibras e sódio e fizeram parte de um cardápio de manutenção de peso de 7 dias que foi repetido ao longo das 16 semanas do estudo. Os resultados mostraram que mulheres que consumiram nozes como lanche reduziram a circunferência da cintura. Além disso, mostraram tendência a reduzir a gordura visceral (intra-abdominal) em comparação com aqueles que consumiram lanches com carboidratos. Homens que consumiram salgadinhos de nozes tiveram uma diminuição nos níveis de insulina no sangue. Um efeito nos triglicerídeos e nas taxas de colesterol foi observado em homens e mulheres que consumiram nozes como lanche, em comparação com aqueles que consumiram lanches com carboidratos. No geral, os pesquisadores observaram uma redução de 67% na pontuação da síndrome metabólica em mulheres e uma redução de 42% na pontuação em homens. De acordo com eles, substituir lanches típicos ricos em carboidratos por nozes (amêndoas, castanhas do Pará, castanhas de caju, avelãs, macadâmias, nozes, pinhões, pistache e nozes) provavelmente teria um impacto positivo na redução do risco de síndrome metabólica e suas consequências entre os jovens.",

    "text": "Nos prognósticos olímpicos, o ouro para os Estados Unidos no basquete masculino é quase sempre barbada . Desde 1936 no programa, os americanos levaram a medalha dourada em 16 dos 20 torneios, em 19 participações (houve o boicote em Moscou, 1980). Mas desta vez o cenário parece apontar para uma maior dificuldade do Dream Team em atropelar a concorrência. Será que o ouro para LeBron James e companhia está em risco?\nEntre agora nas disputas de Paris no Cartola Express e fature prêmios em dinheiro!\n1 de 1 EUA x França, basquete, Olimpíadas de Tóquio 2020 — Foto: REUTERS/Brian Snyder EUA x França, basquete, Olimpíadas de Tóquio 2020 — Foto: REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nVeja como funcionam os scouts das disputas do basquete em Paris\nA vitória por apenas um ponto de diferença para o Sudão do Sul , em amistoso disputado na última semana, aumentou a discussão sobre o poder de fogo da seleção americana. Mesmo assim, é bom ressaltar que a convocação estadunidense tem nomes de peso, como Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis e Kawhi Leonard. Confira o que pode ameaçar uma nova vitória americana.\nMVPs nas Olimpíadas\nDos últimos seis prêmios de MVPs da NBA, apenas Joel Embiid serve a seleção americana (mesmo tendo nascido em Camarões). Nos outros anos, o domínio foi dos pivôs Nikola Jokic, da Sérvia, e Giannis Antetokounmpo, da Grécia. Ambos estão convocados por suas respectivas seleções. O primeiro desafio do Dream Team, aliás, é contra os sérvios, no domingo, às 12h15 (horário de Brasília).\nInternacionalização\nDos 144 jogadores convocados para os Jogos Olímpicos, 76 jogam ou jogaram na NBA em algum momento, mostrando que a internacionalização da principal liga de basquete do mundo não só vem atraindo estrangeiros, como eles têm dominado o cenário diante dos americanos.\nAlém disso, as regras serão as da FIBA, a Federação Internacional de Basquete: 40 minutos divididos em quatro períodos, quadra menor e exclusão com cinco faltas. A favor dos americanos está a linha de 3 menor em relação à NBA, mais convidativa para Stephen Curry.\nDonos dos principais scouts não são americanos\nNa última temporada da NBA, os donos de alguns dos principais scouts foram estrangeiros. O esloveno Luka Dončić foi o cestinha, com 2370 pontos (33,9 por jogo). O reboteiro foi Domantas Sabonis (Lituânia), com 13,7 por partida. Apenas nas assistências aparece Tyrese Haliburton, com 10,9 por duelo. Nenhum dos três está nas Olimpíadas .\nVictor Wembanyama, líder em tocos por partida (3,6) e primeira escolha no Draft ano passado é francês e está convocado. Em arremessos de quadra, Giannis Anetokounmpo também está na área pela Grécia. Quantos americanos convocados foram líderes dos principais scouts da NBA na última temporada? Nenhum .\nDerrota na última Copa do Mundo",

    "text": "Las declamadas intenciones benéficas destinadas a nuestros clubes vienen en papel de envoltorio con la palabra libertad. Una libertad malversada, que nadie pidió, a no ser inversionistas de dudosos o turbios antecedentes para hacer negocios con bienes ajenos. Desde el gobierno de Javier Milei repiten como un mantra la mentirosa ecuación pseudolibertaria. Quieren forzar a instituciones más que centenarias, que se dieron un formato jurídico con el que llegaron hasta acá, a que acepten sin chistar la demolición de su propia historia e identidad. Una historia que continúa en el presente como comunidad asociativa donde la prepotencia mercantil de uno, dos o tres potenciales accionistas no tiene cabida.\nEstamos llegando a un punto crucial donde se definirá el futuro de estas entidades civiles sin fines de lucro que, como pocas otras cosas, se reconocen en el ADN de la argentinidad.\nLa inmensa mayoría de los hinchas de esos clubes sabe de su capacidad de convocatoria. Los mueve la pasión transmitida por generaciones. La defensa de sus colores, su escudo, su gloria, sus obras, sus tierras. En marzo de 2012, unos 100 mil hinchas de San Lorenzo coparon la Plaza de Mayo para pedir \"la restitución del predio de avenida La Plata\". Marcharon desde Boedo por avenida San Juan en caravana y generaron un acto de espesura política. Nunca se había dado tal movilización de socios y simpatizantes con un objetivo ajeno a la celebración deportiva.\n¿Por qué no tantear ahora la posibilidad de que se repita o amplíen los márgenes de aquella jornada histórica?\nLlegó la hora de pensar, evaluar y avanzar en un proyecto semejante que reúna a miles de hinchas, de todos los clubes posibles. Debe sintetizarse la bronca que se respira en los sectores populares. Enojo que se discute en reuniones de las organizaciones político-deportivas que empiezan a proponer una agenda, como la Confederación Argentina de Deportes (CAD), los clubes de barrio sometidos a tarifas impagables, los socios integrados en la Coordinadora de Derechos Humanos del Fútbol Argentino y la sociedad que sostiene en el día a día proyectos comunitarios que no entrarían en el presupuesto de una Sociedad Anónima Deportiva.\nLa ultraderecha 2.0 en el gobierno, azuzada por Mauricio Macri, el primer privatizador de lo privado en el fútbol –los clubes son de sus socios, no de un jeque o un fondo buitre– carece de escrúpulos. Ya demostró que está dispuesta a forzar un cambio en la AFA, que votó en contra de las SAD para incorporarlas a su estatuto. Un hecho para analizar que podría generar un conflicto con la FIFA, aunque esta FIFA tiene a Macri como presidente de su fundación. Lo que no es poco. Envalentonado, el expresidente desafió desde su cuenta de X : \"Ahora es el turno de la AFA, que tiene un año para adaptar sus reglamentos. No tiene sentido resistirse, ¿a qué le tienen miedo?\", se interrogó.\nLa pregunta para los dirigentes la respondemos desde este humilde espacio. Le tenemos miedo a usted y los intereses que representa. Le tenemos miedo al futuro de los clubes en manos de depredadores de adentro y de afuera. Sociedades offshore, CEOS de Wall Street, lavadores, narcos, anónimos accionistas con bandera de conveniencia. No se la vamos a hacer fácil. Se lo aseguro.",
