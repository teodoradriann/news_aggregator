    "text": "Two of the “hardliner” candidates in Iran’s sham presidential “election” dropped out on Thursday, urging their followers to unite against the lone “moderate” among the four remaining candidates, Masoud Pezeshkian.\nTwo of Iran’s former “moderate” presidents likewise urged voters to show their “opposition to blatant oppression” by supporting Pezeshkian against the hardline theocrats.\nIran’s degenerate election season begins with a Guardian Council of hardline theocrats disqualifying about 95 percent of the candidates, deeming them insufficiently loyal to the regime and its notions of Islamic law. The Guardian Council has disqualified every single female candidate in the 45-year history of the Islamic Republic.\nThe remaining handful of candidates are often difficult to distinguish politically, but one of them is usually a “moderate” relative to the others. All are expected to remain obedient to the actual despotic ruler of Iran, the Supreme Leader, currently the aging Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nA great number of Iranians have simply given up on participating in this poor simulation of an election, bringing turnout to record lows in the last few races. Current polling suggests more than half of Iranian voters will boycott the 2024 special election. The regime finds these low participation rates embarrassing, so it does everything it can to pump up the ballot totals.\nThat includes opening “ballot stations” on U.S. soil to harvest Iranian absentee ballots this year, a flex the Biden administration has bizarrely chosen to permit even though the Biden State Department says it “has no expectation” that the election on Friday will be “free or fair.”\nThe moderate candidate in the snap election to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi is Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, a former health minister and cardiac surgeon who spoke out against the regime’s brutal crackdowns on dissidents over the years. Pezeshkian ran for president twice before, in 2013 and 2021, but he did not perform well, so he entered the 2024 special election as a dark-horse candidate.\nPezeshkian quickly gained the support of Mohammad Javad Zarif, former Iranian foreign minister and a chief architect of the 2015 nuclear deal with former President Barack Obama. Pezeshkian has hinted he might bring Zarif back as foreign minister if he wins.\nZarif held his office during a brief period of presidential control by “moderates” Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, both of whom endorsed Pezeshkian on Wednesday. Pezeshkian has adopted Khatami’s campaign slogan, “For Iran,” as his own – a slogan that deliberately suggests marginalizing the theocracy in favor of looking after the best interests of Iranians.\nPezeshkian’s campaign also picked up endorsements from a few prominent dissidents, including activists Hossein Ronaghi and Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is the daughter of former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\nRonaghi and Rafsanjani were both arrested during the 2022 “Women, Life, Freedom” protests, also known as the Amini uprising , which began with the killing of a young Kurdish woman named Mahsa Amini by Iran’s theocratic “morality police” because she allegedly wore her mandatory female head covering incorrectly.\nRonaghi was released from jail, although he was detained again this month because he was carrying the forbidden emblem of the Women, Life, Freedom movement. Ronaghi, a blogger who has contributed to the Wall Street Journal, has said the regime intends to harass him until he flees the country, but he stubbornly refuses to go into exile.\n“The most peaceful way to show your opposition to this blatant oppression, and to send the message of ‘No to the Islamic Republic,’ is to boycott the upcoming farce of an election,” he said in a video message on Wednesday.\nHashemi was sentenced to five years in prison for “propaganda against the regime” and “disturbing public order and peace” during the Amini uprising, beginning her second lengthy stint in prison. She has dismissed Iranian elections as farcical and urged voters to boycott them, because voting made them accessories to the “corrupt policies” of the regime.\nAnother leading dissident figure, jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, announced on Friday from her cell in Evin Prison that she would “not participate in the illegal elections of the oppressive and illegitimate government.”\n“How can you, while holding a sword, gallows, weapons, and prisons against the people with one hand, place a ballot box in front of the same people with the other hand, and deceitfully and falsely call them to the polls?” she said.\n“The only purpose of holding elections for a regime that believes in repression, terror, and violence as the sole means to maintain power is not to uphold democracy and the rights of the people but to consolidate power and tyranny. Such elections will not bring legitimacy to the Islamic Republic,” she declared.\nOther prominent dissidents and human rights groups have called for a boycott of the election, including a group of over 500 activists who issued a joint statement last week announcing they would not vote – not even if Pezeshkian seemed like he had a decent chance of winning.\n“Participation in the elections, even under the assumption of a victory by a reformist candidate, is futile, offering no resolution to ongoing issues. Moreover, it risks bolstering [government’s] legitimacy and intensifying suppression of dissent and protest,” the group of 500 contended.\nHardline candidates Alireza Zakani, the mayor of Tehran, and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi dropped out of the race on Wednesday. They were polling at 1.7 percent and two percent respectively.\nBoth of the hardliners urged the other handpicked theocratic candidates to band together to ensure Pezeshkian does not win.\n“I call upon Saeed Jalili and Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf to unite and not leave the demands of the revolutionary forces unanswered,” Zakani said, referring to two of the remaining hardline candidates.\nGhazizadeh-Hashemi said his purpose for entering the race was “defending the legacy” of fallen hardliner Raisi and he now believed that dropping out was the best way to accomplish that goal. He took pride in “sparing no effort” to defend Raisi’s record during his campaign and he pledged to continue supporting the “martyred” Raisi’s foreign policy accomplishments, by which he meant terrorism .\nSupreme Leader Khamenei publicly threatened Pezeshkian on Tuesday, using theocratic parables mixed with political bluster to suggest that the “moderate” candidate will not be allowed to take office if he is friendly toward the United States and its allies.\n“Some politicians in our country believe they must kowtow to this power or that power, and it’s impossible to progress without sticking to famous countries and powers. Some think like that. Or they think that all ways to progress pass through America,” Khamenei mused, concluding that “such people” could not possibly run Iran well.\nThe ayatollah’s audience responded with chants of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel.”\nHandicapping the race is difficult and, of course, no matter what the ballots actually say, the regime might select a different winner. Pezeshkian does seem to be pulling larger crowds than the regime anticipated, which is one reason the cellar-dwelling hardline candidates dropped out and called for unity against the moderate threat.\nIranian election rules call for a second round of voting if none of the candidates gets past 50 percent in the first round, so consolidating the hardline vote might be the best way to avoid a second-round showdown.\nAnalyst Abbas Abdi told Voice of America News (VOA) on Tuesday that Pezeshkian has vaulted past his designated role as dark-horse punching bag and has a real chance to win. In fact, if the vote is fair, he might even be the frontrunner.\n“Pezeshkian is leading and over the next three days he will definitely widen the gap with others. Withdrawing is not going to help them,” Abdi said, shortly before Akani and Ghazizadeh-Hashemi did exactly that.\nAl Jazeera analyst Zeina Khodr was more pessimistic about Pezeshkian’s chances on Thursday. Khodr said that while the hardliners probably would not rally around a single candidate to crush Pezeshkian, too many reform-minded voters were going to boycott the sham election entirely.\n“It will all depend on voter turnout, and what we’ve seen in previous elections is that there have been record low numbers of people heading to the polling station,” she predicted.\nQalibaf, speaker of the Iranian parliament and a slavish Khamenei loyalist, entered the race as the presumed front-runner. His candidacy and near-certain “victory” in the rigged election was seen as a warning from the regime to human rights activists, as he is a former member of the terrorist Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who oversaw two murderous crackdowns against protesters in 1999 and 2003.\nUnlike Ghazizadeh-Hashemi, Qalibaf has been somewhat critical of Raisi’s poor economic policies, running on promises to raise the Iranian standard of living. He said during the final Iranian presidential debate on Tuesday that if the economy does not improve, the next president might be “forced to either sell Iran to Trump or spark a dangerous tension in the country.”\nGhazizadeh-Hashemi also assumed Donald Trump will return to the White House, and urged voting for a hardline president so “we can negotiate with Trump and impose our demands on him.”\nOne of the other remaining candidates is a cleric and former prosecutor named Mostafa Pourmohammadi who chose to run as a more theocracy-friendly reformer than Pezeshkian – although he has been notably critical of the “morality police” that killed Mahsa Amini. Pourmohammadi’s campaign produced a poster that showed him defiantly facing off against the 45th and possibly 47th U.S. president and declaring: “I am the one who can stand against Trump!”\nIsrael / Middle East National Security Ali Khamenei Ebrahim Raisi Elections Hassan Rouhani Iran Mahsa Amini moderate Mohammad Javad Zarif theocracy",

Devant le succès du premier Café itinérant organisé par l’association France Alzheimer à Saint-Cyprien en avril dernier, à l’attention des personnes atteintes de la maladie et de leurs aidants (ces cafés itinérants sont organisés tous les mois dans une ville différente), la commune a travaillé avec l’association pour que des Haltes-relais Alzheimer soient programmées dorénavant à Saint-Cyprien tous les mois. Les deux premières se sont ainsi tenues vendredi 25 octobre et le dernier en date le mardi 5 novembre à la médiathèque Prosper-Mérimée, en présence d’une douzaine d’aidants et des personnes qu’ils accompagnent au quotidien. De précieux moments d’échanges, animés par une aide médico-psychologique (AMP), Christine, et une bénévole de France-Alzheimer, Marie-José. Ce moment a permis aux malades de se prêter à des ateliers mémoire avec Christine et aux aidants de discuter entre eux et avec Marie-José, ce que les uns comme les autres, souvent isolés, ont de toute évidence apprécié.Tous les Cypriannais accompagnant des proches atteints de la maladie d’Alzheimer, ou d’une autre affection neurodégénérative comme la maladie de Parkinson, sont invités à participer à ces haltes-relais qui sont toujours des moments extrêmement riches, qui leur permettent en outre de partager des informations précieuses. Il leur suffit pour cela de s’inscrire (gratuitement) à la médiathèque au 04 68 37 32 70. La prochaine halte-relais Alzheimer de Saint-Cyprien aura lieu mardi 3 décembre de 14 h à 16 h à la médiathèque.",

    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
