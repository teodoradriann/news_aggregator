    "text": "El gobernador de la Provincia de Buenos Aires Axel Kicillof acusó al presidente de la Nación, Javier Milei, de no trabajar, al considerar que “esos que se dicen eficientes son bien vagos”. “No es una cosa o la otra. De la misma manera que no hay que elegir entre Estado y mercado, son las dos juntas”, empezó el mandatario bonaerense en un acto realizado en el parque industrial de Florencio Varela. Pero siempre es más fácil firmar un decretazo y mandar una súper ley, que dedicarse a laburar y a generar trabajo e industria. Esos que se dicen eficientes además son bien vagos, los decretos se los escriben otros”, deslizó. Martín Guzmán reapareció y cruzó a Milei: “¿No era que tomar deuda era inmoral?” Además aseguró que fue a la reunión con los gobernadores a la que citó el Presidente porque reconoce su legitimidad. “Fue votado en un balotaje, no ganó en primera vuelta. Tiene sus votos y los del balotaje, que son votos entre dos opciones... pero evidentemente hay que reconocer su legitimidad. Ahí estuvimos”. “¿Qué dijo? Sobre el plan económico que empezó el 12 con la devaluación más grande de la historia, con caída de los salarios y aumento de los alimentos, y que sigue con un tarifazo, apertura importadora y destrucción del crédito publico, dijo: ‘Esto no es lo que yo quiero hacer’”, reveló sobre lo manifestado por el mandatario nacional.",

    "text": "As artificial intelligence becomes more common not just in healthcare, but in every industry worldwide, Forbes has released its sixth annual \"AI 50\" list , recognizing 50 of the most promising privately held artificial intelligence companies for 2024. This year, one company in the top 50 focused on AI in healthcare: Pittsburgh-based Abridge. Abridge was founded in 2018 by practicing cardiologist Shiv Rao, MD. The company has now grown to 75 employees. Dr. Rao founded Abridge to free clinicians of time spent doing time-consuming paperwork following patient visits. Abridge records conversations between physicians and patients and uses AI to summarize these interactions. The startup is now worth $850 million and has 10,000 clinician users nationwide, according to Forbes . Forbes compiles the list in partnership with data partners Sequoia and Meritech Capital, considering both qualitative information — such as business models, technical talent and how they're building and using AI-enabled technology — and quantitative figures such as fundraising, valuation and revenue history.

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "Global AI Conclave: India will be at a disadvantage if it doesn’t join the LLM race, says General Catalyst’s Hemant Taneja",
    "text": "In the long term, India will be at a disadvantage if it does not build its own large language model (LLM), Hemant Taneja, CEO and Managing Director of General Catalyst, one of the most prominent venture capital (VC) firms, said while speaking at the CNBC-TV18 &amp; Moneycontrol Global AI Conclave 2024. “If you take the long view, and say that you’re not going to have your intelligence infrastructure or compute infrastructure, that problem is going to keep perpetuating. I do think India needs to think about its own infrastructure. All the way from semiconductors to foundational models,” Taneja said. His view is at odds with what notable Indian tech leaders have maintained. Nandan Nilekani, Infosys chairman and Aadhaar architect, speaking at a recent industry event said, “Let other people build LLMs, we will make sure it works for people.” “Our goal should not be to build one more LLM. Let the big boys in the (Silicon) Valley do it, spending billions of dollars. We will use it to create synthetic data, build small language models quickly, and train them using appropriate data,” he added. LLM is an advanced AI system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. It can answer questions, write text, and assist with tasks by predicting words based on context. The rationale given is that LLMs are capital-intensive and require years of development—an area where companies like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and other tech giants have already invested substantial time and resources in recent years. Taneja also said, in India, there is a shortage of engineers who know how to use AI and that new categories need to emerge. Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy also cited India’s lack of problem-solving abilities in certain technologies, adding that the country should not yet invest in building its own large language models (LLMs). “We have not been able to build large databases, and without big data, AI (artificial intelligence) has no value. A large language model (LLM) doesn't make any sense. Basically, the Indian mindset is still not oriented towards problem definition and problem-solving,” Murthy had said in an interview with Moneycontrol earlier.\",",

That made him the perfect person for the job when he took over as president and CEO of Wings Over the Rockies in January 2017. Colorado is full of devoted entrepreneurs, business leaders and tech-savvy visionaries who are constantly taking the business world to new heights. It’s no secret that here, at ColoradoBiz, we love the Colorado business community. That’s why, every year, we spotlight the most impressive CEOs throughout our Centennial state and give credit where credit is due — to the forward-thinking minds constantly chasing the next great idea and upholding their business practices to the most purposeful ideals. We’re proud to introduce our finalists for CoBiz’s prestigious 2022 CEO of the Year award. John Barry President and CEO Wings Over the Rockies Denver, Colorado Website: [www.wingsmuseum.org](http://wingsmuseum.org) Managing, inspiring and leading large groups of people during challenging times is John Barry’s superpower. That made him the perfect person for the job when he took over as president and CEO of Wings Over the Rockies in January 2017 and was tasked with opening a second site at Centennial Airport, now known as Exploration of Flight (EOF). Barry, a retired U.S. Air Force major general with a long list of career accomplishments, quickly assembled a team from the Wings board and staff that worked to negotiate a zero percent loan from the Walton Family Foundation for $3.3 million that allowed the first building to be completed within 18 months. This second Wings site also houses a charter middle school for more than 200 students that opened in 2020. In the works and slated to open in 2024 are a Food Hall and additional hangar. Other notable accomplishments of the past year under Barry’s watch include: welcoming more than 135,000 visitors representing 50 states and 31 countries to Wings; continuing the “Behind the Wings” video series on PBS, with airings in 100 markets and in 39 states and more than 9 million YouTube views; completing and updating two new Wings exhibits; developing new and innovative educational pathways that are at the core of Wings’ mission to help prepare and inspire Colorado’s youth for careers in aerospace; facilitating students building 80 percent of Wings’ RV–12iS aircraft with support and help from Wings staff and volunteers (Barry flew all the test flights for certification); awarding 22 Colorado students the James C. Ray Foundation Flight Training Scholarships in 2023, bringing the total to more than 125 flight training scholarships worth more than $1 million since 2019. Barry, who grew up in a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, served in the U.S. Air Force for more than 30 years before retiring in 2004. He was a fighter pilot, logging 270 hours of combat time. He served as president and CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metro Denver (BGCMD) from 2014 to 2016 and was superintendent of Aurora Public Schools for seven years, from 2006 to 2013.",
