    "text": "Libya’s Mabruk Oil Operations has resumed production at the Mabruk oilfield after a decade-long shutdown, the Tripoli-based Government of National Unity said in a statement on Wednesday.\nProduction officially restarted on Sunday at an initial rate of 5,000 barrels per day, according to the statement, with plans to increase to 7,000 bpd by the end of March and 25,000 bpd by July.\nLibya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) had previously announced plans to reopen the Mabruk oilfield in the first quarter of 2023, targeting production of 25,000 barrels per day, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\nThe field was closed in 2015 following what the NOC described as a “terrorist” attack, which resulted in $575 million in field equipment losses.\nLibya, which holds Africa’s largest proven oil reserves, has faced challenges in maintaining consistent output due to internal conflicts and infrastructure damage since 2011.\n“This marks a significant step forward in Libya’s oil sector, reflecting improved stability and confidence in our capacity to rebuild and boost the national economy,” Wednesday’s statement said.",

    "text": "SEOUL - Six months after he started work at an agricultural machinery factory in South Korea in 2021, Mr Ajit Roy, who is from Bangladesh, started having a severe cough that would not go away.\nHis work at the factory in Anseong city, an hour’s drive from Seoul, required him to sand down metal parts for more than eight hours a day, and he was provided with only a cotton mask as protection.\nThe industrial practice for such a task usually includes hearing protection, safety glasses, a face shield, gloves and flame-resistant clothing.\nWhen Mr Roy finally sought medical attention at a hospital in Seoul after his symptoms became worse and he had trouble breathing, he was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease – an ailment commonly associated with extended exposure to hazardous particles.\nThe disease causes lung damage that is often irreversible and worsens over time.\nAfter undergoing surgery, Mr Roy is now left with only 60 per cent lung function. He is unable to work and remains in South Korea for treatment. He has been told that the life expectancy for patients like him is four years from diagnosis if he does not undergo treatment.\nHe is receiving shelter at a church which takes care of his living and medical expenses. In return, he helps to interpret for other migrant workers in need.\nMr Roy, now 39, is among the growing number of foreign workers in South Korea who are helping to plug the country’s labour shortfall caused largely by an ageing population and falling birth rates.\nThe foreign workers take on low-paid manual jobs in labour-intensive industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and fisheries that are shunned by locals.\nBut as the number of foreign workers rise – with the yearly quota for new work permits for such workers more than doubling from 60,000 in 2022 to 165,000 in 2024 – a growing number of cases of migrant worker abuse such as that faced by Mr Roy are also coming to light.\nApart from facing discrimination and language barriers, migrant workers are being owed wages, endure poor working conditions and are exploited by job brokers who charge high commissions.\nBrokers’ exploitation of workers is so rife that it prompted the National Human Rights Commission of Korea to issue a statement on Nov 5, calling on the government to come up with measures to protect foreign workers from unscrupulous brokers. Foreign workers rely on brokers to find employment in South Korea.\nThe commission said the current system lacks a central oversight that would better protect such workers.\nA coalition of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) held a press briefing for foreign media on Nov 27 to highlight the plight of migrant workers and to push for reform of the foreign labour employment scheme which began in 2004.\nMr Udaya Rai, who heads the migrant workers’ union under the influential Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, said at the briefing: “The scheme has changed a lot over the past 20 years, but most of the changes are favourable to the employers and the pain and difficulties experienced by migrant workers have not improved much.”\nSouth Korea’s migrant worker scheme sources workers from 16 Asian countries including Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam, with 560,000 currently in the country.\nWhen Philippine national Mary Kris Omangay came to South Korea in May 2024 for three months of seasonal farm work, she was hoping to earn money to support her youngest sister through nursing school.\nThe understanding with her broker was that she just needed to transfer half of her monthly salary of 1.28 million won (S$1,228) to the broker as commission, over a period of three months, which Ms Omangay complied with.\nBut when the 35-year-old’s contract was extended for a further three months, the broker continued to demand the commission, which Ms Omangay felt was too much and refused to comply.\n“He threatened to send me back to the Philippines if I do not cooperate,” said Ms Omangay at the briefing.\nShe stopped working from September, and has since lodged a complaint with the labour authorities against the broker, to recover the extra month of commission paid.\nShe is being assisted by the non-governmental organisation 1218 For All that helps migrant workers in need, whose representative Ko Gi-bo told The Straits Times that while the amount is small, the action is about taking steps to stop brokers’ exploitation of workers like Ms Omangay.\nMr Ko thinks that the rising demand for migrant workers has led to local governments being unable to cope with the management of the workers.\nHe said: “The work should be better coordinated at the regional or national level, or even with a dedicated government agency established to prevent intermediaries from wielding too much authority while profiting at the same time.”\nA graver issue facing migrant workers is wage arrears.\nLabour ministry data released in September 2024 showed that wages owed to some 15,000 foreign workers in the first seven months of 2024 amounted to a record 70 billion won. This works out to each foreign worker being owed at least 4.6 million won.\nOn Nov 18, the ministry released a statement pledging “swift and strict investigations” into such complaints, while doubling down on on-site inspections where migrant workers are employed.\nEarlier in June 2024, the ministry had launched a multilingual counselling service to provide support to foreign workers, such as helping them to adjust to life in South Korea and to arbitrate employment-related disputes, at 27 local labour offices across the country.\nAmong those seeking payment of owed wages is Ms Thlang Tepy from Cambodia, who has been waiting for the past two years to recover 29 million won from her former employer. The 28-year-old had come to South Korea four years ago to work on a farm. Although she worked more than 11 hours a day, her employer paid her for only eight hours of work and deducted up to 40 per cent of her monthly wage for living expenses.\nShe was housed with three other workers in a container on the farm.\nWhen she asked her employer for a raise two years ago, she was threatened with the cancellation of her work permit, and was forced to give her employer one million won to get out of her contract. As she had left before the monthly payday, she was not paid for that month of work and did not receive her severance pay.\nThe 29 million won include her owed wages, severance pay and the one million won she gave her employer.\n“My complaint was filed a year ago, but my former employer refuses to cooperate with the authorities and the authorities say they cannot do much,” she said through an interpreter.\nShe has been unemployed in the meantime and worries about her future.\n“But if I leave now, I will lose all my money. I feel like I’m stuck in limbo!” said Ms Tepy, who is being assisted by two NGOs.\nLike Ms Tepy, Mr Roy is also still waiting for a resolution of his case.\nHe had applied for industrial accident compensation from his employer two years ago but his application was rejected by the Korea Workers’ Compensation And Welfare Service, a government agency in charge of labour welfare and social security issues, which had reviewed the case based on the employer’s statement.\nMr Roy and his pro-bono lawyer Choi Jung-kyu say that the factory had cleaned up its workplace practices for the agency’s inspection. They are appealing for a review.\n“My plan was to work for just two years in South Korea and then go back to my country to become a public official. But now with my lung disease, all my hopes are dashed. My only wish now is to live longer despite my terminal disease,” said Mr Roy, who broke down while talking and needed time to compose himself.\nHe now takes eight pills a day and goes for a check-up every six months. Mr Roy says he cannot return to Bangladesh yet as he would not be able to receive the treatment he needs there.\n“It is the only way for me to live longer, to hopefully get better and have a job again to support my family back home.”\nMr Ko, whose NGO started helping migrant workers in 2022, said: “There has been intense local media attention on the migrant workers’ plights since we started, but still nothing has changed.”\nCalling for reform, he said that the foreign labour employment scheme’s “failings should be scrutinised to strengthen public interest and ensure procedural transparency and accountability”.",
