    "text": "Accusations of a cover-up have surfaced after an illegal alien allegedly kidnapped and raped a 15-year-old girl in upstate New York and was allowed to wander about freely for more than a month before he was arrested by police, who did not notify the public that a violent rapist had been taken off their streets.\nThe horrific incident occurred shortly after midnight on May 14. A 15-year-old girl had run away from a group home in Albany, New York, and was walking along New Scotland Avenue when a man in a Toyota Prius pulled over and forced the girl into the car, brandishing a metal pipe and threatening to brutalize her with it if she refused to cooperate.\n‘If an asylum-seeker snatching a kid (off a public street) and raping them and remaining on the loose is not a threat to public safety, then what is a threat to public safety?’\nOnce the girl was in the passenger seat, the car drove away and parked in an isolated area near South Pearl Street. The driver of the vehicle then forced the girl into the backseat, removed her clothes, and forcibly raped her. Scratches on the girl’s legs, noted in the police report, indicated that the girl had fought back against the vicious assault.\nThe man then let the girl go, and she ran to a nearby residence for help. The girl gave consistent statements to police during at least two different interviews, both of which occurred weeks apart, and surveillance footage appeared to corroborate at least some of the girl’s story, the Albany Times Union reported.\nThe girl was also able to pick her attacker out of a photo line-up, pointing to Sakir Akkan, a 21-year-old Turkish national who illegally entered the U.S. in San Diego late last November. At the time, he was arrested by Border Patrol and charged with “alien removal,” but he was later released into the U.S., reportedly because of lack of bed space, and ordered to appear at an immigration hearing in February 2025. He has since attempted to be granted asylum.\nExactly when Akkan was first identified as a possible suspect in the rape of the 15-year-old New York girl is unclear. However, he was not arrested until June 18, more than a month later. Even then, Albany police did not announce the arrest to the public as they have about the arrests of other violent alleged rapists, including one who was arrested earlier this month.\nWhen news outlets pressed about the department’s apparent lack of communication, Officer Megan Craft, a spokeswoman for the Albany Police Department, indicated that police didn’t see any need to spread the news widely.\n“It was determined that there was no immediate threat to public safety during that time,” Craft said. “Had there been a perceived threat to the public, appropriate information would have been released.”\nCraft also indicated that, so long as alleged sexual assaults “do not pose a threat to the public,” the department has a “general” policy not to issue press releases about rape arrests “to prevent retraumatization of the victim.”\nHowever, someone familiar with the investigation who spoke with the Times Union on condition of anonymity countered: “If an asylum-seeker snatching a kid (off a public street) and raping them and remaining on the loose is not a threat to public safety, then what is a threat to public safety?”\nCraft also made references to “inconsistencies” in the investigation into the rape, though the Times Union could not find any inconsistencies in the police reports or the available evidence. The outlet also expressed confusion about why such alleged inconsistences would have “had any bearing on the department’s decision not to notify the public about the abduction and sexual assault.”\nAlbany County legislator Steve McLaughlin was likewise dumbfounded by the apparent secrecy surrounding the rape. “We are suppose [sic] to believe this wasn’t covered up by the city administration?” he posted to his personal X account . “Bulls**t. This is a national story. What the hell went on here?”\nRepublicans in the state Senate likewise claimed the secrecy was “disgraceful” and accused city leadership of showing “a shocking lack of concern for New Yorker’s [sic] safety.”\nAlbany Police Chief Eric Hawkins slammed the accusations and claimed the department had been “grossly mischaracterized” regarding this investigation. He also insisted that Akkan’s immigration status “was simply not a factor in the media release decision.”\nA spokesperson for Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan denied any knowledge of the rape or the immigration status of the suspect. “We were not aware of the individual’s immigration status prior to your inquiry,” the spokesperson told the Times Union.\nWRGB rose to the defense of “police and Democratic lawmakers in Albany,” claiming that allegations of a cover-up have been made “without evidence.”\nAkkan remains in custody at the Albany County Correctional Facility on a charge of first-degree rape. ICE issued an immigration detainer against him two days after his arrest.\nThe New York Post reported that illegal immigrants from Turkey have been known to cross the southern border in the San Diego area. According to the outlet, approximately 15,000 Turkish natives were apprehended by Border Patrol in that region in both 2022 and 2023.\nLike Blaze News?

    "text": "Rio Tinto and Edify Energy have signed two new solar and battery hybrid services agreements (HSAs) to increase the supply of reliable, competitively priced electricity to Rio Tinto’s Gladstone aluminium operations in Queensland.\nUnder the agreements, Rio Tinto will purchase 90% of the power and battery storage capacity generated by the Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations for 20 years. Edify Energy will build, own, and operate the projects, with construction due to begin in late 2025 and targeting completion in 2028.\nLocated in Central Queensland, the adjacent Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations, will together feature 600MWac 1 of solar and 600MW / 2,400MWh of battery storage.\nRio Tinto Chief Executive, Australia, Kellie Parker said: \"These agreements are integral to repowering our Gladstone aluminium operations with affordable, reliable and lower carbon energy for decades to come.\n“For the first time, we have integrated crucial battery storage in our efforts to make the Boyne aluminium smelter globally cost-competitive, as traditional energy sources become more expensive.\n“We continue to investigate further renewable energy investments to repower our Gladstone aluminium operations.”\nEdify Energy Chief Executive, John Cole, acknowledged the importance of this new services agreement in providing clean, reliable and cost-effective electricity to energy consumers.\n“The Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations deliver the latest in solar, battery and inverter technology to support Australia’s power needs.\n“This collaboration is an important commitment to supporting the sustainable future of Australia's industrial sector. We are proud to advance Rio Tinto's goals to repower its Gladstone operations and to play a role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.”\nWhen combined with the 2.2GW of renewable wind and solar PPAs Rio Tinto announced for its Gladstone operations in 2024, the Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap agreements help secure a total of 2.7GW 2 of future wind and solar energy in Queensland.\nTogether, the four contracted projects are expected to supply 80% of Boyne smelter’s annual average electricity demand, reducing the smelter’s scope 1 and 2 emissions by 70% 3 , or 5.6Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. This is the equivalent of removing about 2 million internal combustion engine cars from the road.\nRio Tinto's 90% share of the Smoky Creek & Guthrie's Gap battery system capacity amounts to 2,160MWh, which will provide about 30% of the firming required to repower the Boyne smelter with renewable energy. It will store green energy for reliable use during peak demand periods or low solar output, which will improve stability and resilience of Queensland’s power network.\nRio Tinto's integrated aluminium production chain in Queensland is a significant economic driver for the state and Australia, directly employing over 4500 people and supporting thousands more livelihoods. The company's operations in Gladstone alone account for more than 3000 jobs, with 1000 of those at the Boyne smelter.\nRio Tinto’s three production assets in the Gladstone region are the Boyne aluminium smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland alumina refinery.\nFurther information on the Smoky Creek & Guthrie's Gap Power Station is available here .\n1 The solar farm will have 720MWp (megawatt peak) of installed solar panels – the theoretical maximum potential output– and will deliver 600MWac (megawatts alternating current) of usable power to the grid.\n2 This comprises of the following contracted renewable energy projects: 1.1GW of Windlab’s proposed 1.4GW Bungaban wind project, 1.1GW from European Energy’s proposed Upper Calliope solar farm and 540MW from Edify Energy’s combined 600MW Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations.\n3 5.6Mt CO2e and 70% reduction are on a 100% managed basis.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312396623/en/\nContacts Please direct all enquiries to media.enquiries@riotinto.com\nMedia Relations,\nUnited Kingdom\nDavid Outhwaite\nM +44 7787 597 493\nMedia Relations,\nAustralia\nMatt Chambers\nM +61 433 525 739\nMichelle Lee\nM +61 458 609 322\nRachel Pupazzoni\nM +61 438 875 469\nMedia Relations,\nCanada\nSimon Letendre\nM +1 514 796 4973\nMalika Cherry\nM +1 418 592 7293\nVanessa Damha\nM +1 514 715 2152\nMedia Relations,\nUS\nJesse Riseborough\nM +1 202 394 9480\nInvestor Relations,\nUnited Kingdom\nRachel Arellano\nM: +44 7584 609 644\nDavid Ovington\nM +44 7920 010 978\nLaura Brooks\nM +44 7826 942 797\nWeiwei Hu\nM +44 7825 907 230\nInvestor Relations,\nAustralia\nTom Gallop\nM +61 439 353 948\nAmar Jambaa\nM +61 472 865 948\nRio Tinto plc\n6 St James’s Square\nLondon SW1Y 4AD\nUnited Kingdom\nT +44 20 7781 2000\nRegistered in England\nNo. 719885\nRio Tinto Limited\nLevel 43, 120 Collins Street\nMelbourne 3000\nAustralia\nT +61 3 9283 3333\nRegistered in Australia\nABN 96 004 458 404\nriotinto.com\nCategory:General\nStock Quote API & Stock News API supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted.\nLeo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital.\nThere has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city.\nThat scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school.\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar made the comments during his end of year media briefing (Niall Carson/PA) Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected.\nMr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists.\n“There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said.\n“If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world.\n“But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places.\n“(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.”\nA burned out bus is removed from O’Connell Street in Dublin in the aftermath of violent scenes in the city centre on November 23 (Brian Lawless/PA) Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician.\n“Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed.\n“The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country.\n“Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else.\n“While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”",
