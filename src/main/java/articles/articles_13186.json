    "title": "Ottobrata e temperature più che godibili. Sottocorona: dove si arriva fino a 25 gradi",
    "text": "Meteo, ottobrata e temperature più che godibili. Sottocorona: fino a 25 gradi\nChe tempo c’è da aspettarsi nei prossimi giorni a cavallo della metà di ottobre? A spiegarlo è il meteorologo d La7, Paolo Sottocorona, che nel suo appuntamento quotidiano durante Omnibus prima di tutto mostra la carta meteorologica inglese: “Salta all'occhio questa zona di alta pressione, quindi sull’Italia il tempo brutto non può essere, può essere grigio, ma è un tempo stabile, perché siamo proprio al centro dell'alta pressione. Anticiclone tirrenico se vogliamo dargli il nome. Vedendo la giornata di martedì addirittura il centro dell'alta pressione sale, con un buon valore di alta pressione, un valore piuttosto alto, sull'Italia non passa neanche un’isobara. Sulle coste atlantiche del continente c'è la fine del mondo di maltempo, noi qui in questo caso restiamo protetti”.\n\"Cambierà tutto all'improvviso\". L'annuncio di Giuliacci: quando arriva il ribaltone\nEd ecco le previsioni del tempo giorno per giorno: “La previsione per la giornata di oggi, domenica 13 ottobre, è di tempo stabile, che significa in questa stagione anche un po' di grigio, appena al sud, un po' più presente al nord, dove sui rilievi alpini e prealpini, sulla Liguria, forse qualche debolissima precipitazione, ma è il massimo che può succedere. Nella giornata di lunedì 14 ottobre situazione molto simile con schiarite anche più ampie per quanto riguarda il centro e il sud, al nord sempre un cielo un po' grigio, forse qualche pioviggine. Il tempo stabile in Pianura Padana è tipico poi per formare delle nebbie, delle foschie dense, perché l'aria è piuttosto ferma. Nella giornata di martedì 15 ottobre c’è un cielo grigio e coperto al nord, piogge no, pioviggini nemmeno, però una situazione un po' un po' grigia. In parte anche al centro, molto meno al sud, che in questo contesto avrà delle giornate da ottobrata e anche forse qualcosa di più”.\nIl meteorologo crolla in diretta tv: \"È orribile\" | VIDEO\nSottocorona termina il suo focus con le temperature massime previste per la giornata di oggi: “I colori diventano un po' più carichi, al sud siamo anche sui 24-25 gradi, ma i 20 gradi si prendono anche al nord, al centro 22-24. Insomma per essere la data che è quindi siamo oltre la metà di ottobre non è male. La tendenza nelle prossime 24 ore evidenzia che c'è una linea con piccoli assestamenti. Al sud e al centro positivi, sulla Pianura Padana forse leggermente a scendere le massime rispetto a ieri. Bisogna vedere la situazione delle nebbie come può influire sull'andamento delle temperature”.\nDai blog\nQui Lazio\nLa ricetta di Baroni per far volare la Lazio\nLuigi Salomone\nControtempo\n\"Tanta Roma nelle mie canzoni\".

    "title": "They’re Going to Try to Kill Trump Again",
    "text": "Have you ever seen a presidential election turn as dark as this one has, courtesy of Kamala Harris and the Democrat Party?\nYes, we've lived through the complicit media taking so-called \"October surprises\" – which are always aimed at Republicans – as proven fact and exploiting them grotesquely in order to get Democrats across the finish line. Remember the Steele Dossier?\nIn 2024, however, it looks like Democrats are taking things to such an unprecedented level that it's not at all crazy to draw this conclusion: They need him dead.\nThis is the party of Hillary Clinton, after all.\nIt's clear to even the most casual political observer that Kamala is a terrible candidate who is in way over her head. On any given day, many of us are left wondering if her campaign staff actually want her to lose, so bad is the advice she seems to be getting from them. She's embarrassingly bad on the campaign trail, and there are murmurings that she regularly unloads on her team for not preparing her better. Unfortunately for Kamala, there's no amount of preparation that will make her a better candidate. She's just that bad.\nNow, here we are, less than two weeks out from the election, and things have gotten so bad for Kamala Harris that there is an obvious effort afoot to take out Donald Trump by any means necessary. Since she couldn't do it through talent or charisma, she'll have to do it another way.\nThe two assassination attempts, so far, against Trump are proof that Democrats have been successfully telegraphing to their foot soldiers that the \"orange man\" isn't just bad, he's a \"threat to democracy.\" She's been beating that drum for a while.\nMost sane people just blow off that kind of rhetoric as political posturing, but the Democrat Party isn't exactly teeming with sane people these days. They cater to society's most unhinged elements, then throw the red meat of \"threat to democracy\" and \"literally Hitler\" to them. And then they sit back and watch what happens; that slanted roof in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the sniper's nest in West Palm Beach, Florida, is what happens when Democrats eat the red meat thrown to them by their overlords.\nBut, neither of Trump's would-be assassins was successful, much to the chagrin of the left. That brings us to today, where we find the latest dog whistles from Democrats to their brownshirt underlings: an entirely fabricated article in The Atlantic and Kamala Harris's highly inflammatory words.\nIf you need to come up to speed on The Atlantic article, RedState's Neil W. McCabe has done an excellent job of covering the story and all of the developments related to it. The gist of it is that The Atlantic activist/editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, penned an article entitled: “Trump: ‘I Need the Kind of Generals That Hitler Had,'\" and relied on the recollections of those oh-so-reliable \"unnamed sources\" to paint an altogether false narrative that Donald Trump disdains the U.S. military and is obsessed with fascist dictators.\nTo prove this, Goldberg falsified a story about Trump refusing to pay the funeral expenses of Army soldier Vanessa Guillen, who was brutally murdered in 2020.\nThe best part is that numerous named sources, including Vanessa Guillen's sister and Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows, went on record and denied everything that Goldberg shamefully and dishonestly claimed happened. It's your standard leftist dreck, but the goal is pretty clear: convince certain people that Donald Trump is an existential threat to the United States, and if Kamala Harris doesn't have the chops to beat him fairly at the ballot box, and she doesn't, then something needs to be done to make sure he doesn't make it to Election Day.\nBecause she is just that desperate, Kamala Harris came along and threw gas on the ignominious flames ignited by Goldberg and, as RedState's Jennifer Van Laar reported, clownishly proclaimed Wednesday:\n\"Yesterday we learned that Donald Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired four-star general, confirmed that while Donald Trump was president he said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had. Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the U.S. Constitution; he wants a military that is loyal to him. He wants a military who will be loyal to him personally, one that will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the Constitution of the United States.\"\nThe subtext isn't hard for us sane people to grasp, namely that Kamala is sinking fast and isn't capable of stopping it, but her words aren't meant for us; her words are meant for her unhinged base in the hopes that they'll see the words \"Trump\" and \"Hitler\" and take action. All of this despite the fact that Donald Trump was president for four years and nary a Nazi-like tactic was deployed during all of that time.\nThe Atlantic article and Kamala's \"literally Hitler\" rhetoric are trial balloons being floated for the next few days to see just how much outrage they can gin up ahead of her \"closing argument\" scheduled for next Tuesday. Kamala will reportedly make her last-ditch appeal to voters from the National Mall near the White House, and you can bet she, her advisors, and the Democrat Party elite are salivating over the idea that this fallacious line of attack will finally be Donald Trump's undoing, whether literally or figuratively.\nExpect her speech next week to be filled with violent histrionics about Donald Trump being a \"threat to democracy\" because that's all she's got. Unless, of course, one of her followers decides to take matters into their own hands, as we've seen twice over the last few months.\nLet's be honest here: Kamala would rather not have to do the hard work of being a good candidate who wins the election on her merits, and she doesn't have the time or ability to pull off that feat, anyway. Someone else is going to have to save her at this point, and that's what this most recent news cycle is all about.\nThis is way beyond politics as usual. It is dark, it is sinister. It's what happens when Democrats are on the ropes and seeing power slip from their grasp. The last week of the election is going to be brutal, friends, so buckle up. And let's pray that Donald Trump has the security around him that he needs, particularly in the wake of the left's not-so-subtle calls to violence.",

    "text": "We reported a preview only days ago, and here it is, the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe. It will enter the ring to stake its claim on the compact coupe SUV market.\nIt’s going to be Mercedes-Benz’s answer to the BMW X4 and it will make its public debut at the Shanghai auto show tomorrow. It is only a concept at this stage but it is set to spawn a production version in the near future. Mercedes even describes the vehicle as a “near production” creation.\nThe GLC Coupe concept features a 4.73m long body with a 2.83m wheelbase, rising to only 1.6m tall. With a sloping roofline, quad-outlet exhaust pipes, a sophisticated side profile and intimidating front grille, Mercedes is pulling out all the stops to try and pinch some of BMW’s near-monopoly on the segment.\nBeneath the bonnet the concept is powered by a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 producing 270kW at 5500 rpm, and 520Nm between 1400 and 5000rpm. The powertrain is mated to a 4MATIC four-wheel drive system via a nine-speed automatic transmission. Gorden Wagener, head of design at Daimler AG, said,\n“With its modern and sensual design idiom, the Concept GLC Coupe gives a foretaste of future SUV models from Mercedes-Benz. At the same time, it embraces the typical values of tradition-steeped Mercedes-Benz coupes.”\nA production version is expected to appear in the next 12 months. It will sit beneath the new GLE Coupe and become part of the company’s new naming structure, sitting in as the C-Class SUV four-door coupe.",

    "text": "[Osdransky](/user/Osdransky)a [eldiario.es](/go/link/3891544)\nLa plaza consistorial de Pamplona parece sanfermines en esta moción pero el PP sigue sin entender absolutamente nada!!!!\nIdos a tomar por culo!!!!!!!\n[#1](c1#c-1) llevan así desde la recogida de firmas para derogar el estatut catalán. Pero que sigan, que sigan.\n[#10](c10#c-10) y eso que allí ponen todos los impedimentos posibles para que la gente no vote (sobre todo los grupos poblacionales que no suelen votar a los republicanos).\n[#1](c1#c-1) Positivo por el elefante uso del imperativo del verbo ir con el enclético \"os\". Aunque la real academia admite desde hace años \"iros\" y todos recordamos con cariño aquel \"si me queréis, irse\" de la gran Lola no es menos cierto que \"Idos a tomar por culo\" destila elegancia, clasicismo, ritmo, gracia y donaire en cada sílaba.\n[#9](c9#c-9) No hay ningún clasismo, todo lo contrario, está reconociendo la dureza de ese trabajo y el mérito que tiene hacerlo.\nEs como si dijera \"preferiría trabajar en la mina\". Se refiere a la dureza del trabajo.\nNo va a decir \"preferiría trabajar como CEO de un eléctrica\", lo cual no suena a trabajo físico duro.\nNingún clasismo, pero lo dice elpanfleto.es, manipulando, y os lo tragáis todo sin masticar. Qué pena. Un poquito de capacidad crítica no os vendría mal, deberíais intentarlo, aunque os cueste, debido a que hay que pensar y eso no es fácil para vosotros. Es más fácil formar parte del rebaño.\n[#21](c21#c-21) te voy a explicar porque es clasismo. No hace muchos años estas señoras de bien lo primero que veían cuando salian por la puerta de su casa era una mujer fregando escaleras. Y las miraban con desprecio porque sabian que si no se hubieran casado con un hombre de bien posiblemente serían una de ellas, y ahi estaban las limpiadoras de escaleras para recordárselo. Por eso muchas veces estas nobles condesas trataban de la peor manera a estas limpiadoras, porque veían en ellas lo que podían llegar a ser ellas si la vida les daba un revés. Por eso es Clasismo del rancio.\nA mí el que me hace gracia es Feijó diciendo que el PSOE ya no es un partido constitucionalista.\nPues no sé, creo que debió quedarse dormido en el artículo 1 porque en el 140 ya te dice de forma general cómo se eligen los concejales y como son éstos los que eligen a un alcalde.\nEn fin, que habrá quien le compre el discurso, pero no hay por donde cogerlo\n[#14](c14#c-14) ¿Que se modere?\n¡Le pagan y muy bien por eso!\nY le sacan en El Hormiguero cada vez que escribe un libro.\nNo conoces a los Lara, los del Planeta, ni a Mauricio su jefe directo.\nEl aislamiento del PP,UPN, muestra que estos partidos como la frase demuestra son partidos para defender los intereses de las clases privilegiadas; y que al no poder presentar su programa: defender los intereses de los ricos, el único argumento que han tenido y tienen es ETA, al no existir ETA ya, se han quedado sin argumentos con los que conseguir votos de los que no son de su clase social\nCreo que les ha retratado muy bien. Estoy un poco cansado de eldiario pero este artículo es bastante adecuado.\n[#0](c0#c-0) gracias\n[#2](c2#c-2) Tranquilo, tienen todo el escudo mediático. No lo verás en el telediario de A3, salvo que esa misma frase la hubiera dicho una alcaldesa del PSOE o de SUMAR.\n[#5](c5#c-5) Al hilo de lo que dices, hoy he visto las noticias de la noche de A·, con Vicente Vallés, y, en algún momento creía que le iba a dar un infarto: los independentistas, Bildu, traición del PSOE, traición de Sánchez y así así... Uno, si sigue escuchando cree que va a llegar el final de la democracia y el apocalipsis, como mínimo.\n[#6](c6#c-6) es indecente lo de ese señor... verlo vomitar bilis de esa manera, da muchisima grima, no se como no le aconseja alguien que se modere un poco",

Macron também disse que a França não quer que o Líbano se torne uma nova Faixa de Gaza. Ele pediu que Israel pare com os ataques aéreos e que o Hezbollah pare de retaliar.",

    "title": "Weekend dell'Epifania con perturbazioni in vista e i primi fiocchi di neve del 2025",
    "text": "Ci attende un weekend dell'Epifania piuttosto perturbato. Le correnti in quota oscilleranno tra nordovest e sudovest. Questa situazione porta a cambi di temperatura repentini con passaggi freddi e perturbati piuttosto veloci, e condizioni meteorologiche molto variabili.\nAl Nord Ovest quindi avremo questa situazione:\nOggi venerdì 3 e domani sabato 4 gennaio\nCielo generalmente sereno o poco nuvoloso ma con possibili nebbie stanotte e domani mattina in pianura. Da domani pomeriggio precipitazioni deboli o localmente moderate sui rilievi di confine norodccidentali e della Val'Aosta, con neve a quote estremamente variabili causa infiltrazioni di aria più calda alle medie quote, che potranno generare episodi di piogga gelata.\nTemperature massime in pianura ancora generalmente oltre i 10/12 °C oggi. In serata calo netto per l'arrivo di aria più fredda dal Nord Europa che renderà rigida la giornata gia dal mattino di oggi in montagna. Domani mattina quindi minime diffusamente sotto lo 0 (fino a -2/-3 °C) , con gelate e brinate estese. Le massime difficilmente andranno oltre i 5/7 °C. Sulle coste invece ancora qualche zona potrà raggiungere i 10 °C.\nVenti pressoché calmi o deboli variabili ovunque, in intensificazione sui rilievi alpini occidentali dalla serata di domani.\nDomenica 5 e sabato 6 gennaio\nCielo molto nuvoloso domenica, con deboli precipitazioni sui settori orientali del Piemonte e sulla Liguria. Lunedì cielo coperto ovunque per il transito di una perturbazione, che porterà precipitazioni di un certo rilievo sui settori alpini settentrionali e tra Liguria occidentale e Alpi marittime, a partire dalla sera. Tuttavia la quota neve sarà piuttosto alta, almeno oltre i 1200/1300 m.\nTemperature minime in aumento domenica mattina con basso rischio di gelate, mentre le massime rimarranno stazionarie e piuttosto basse. Lunedì temperature in ulteriore lievissimo aumento sulle pianure, oltre i 12/13 °C di massima sulle coste liguri.\nVenti assenti o deboli variabili su pianure. Moderati o localmente forti da sudovest su Alpi e su Liguria di levante, in particolare sui rilievi appeninici.\nDa martedì 7 gennaio\nAncora piogge diffuse nella notte di martedì, in spostamento verso est ed esaurimento nella mattinata. Ritorno a condizioni più stabili soprattutto in pianura poiché le correnti in quota si orienteranno perlopiù da ovest, con annuvolamenti quasi continui e precipitazioni diffuse sulle Alpi di confine.\nCon i-Gate segui le spettacolari immagini in diretta live da Sant'Anna di Vinadio, Castelmagno, Pietraporzio, Busca, Grinzane Cavour, etc. qui https://www.i-gate.it/streaming.php#live-streaming\nCuneo",
