    "title": "Former Hong Kong independence group leader seeks asylum in Britain",
    "text": "By Kanishka Singh\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) – The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group, who was sentenced under a national security law imposed by China, fled to Britain and will seek asylum over there, he told the Washington Post.\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\nIn November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under the sweeping national security law in 2020 and denied bail.\nBeijing imposed the national security law on the Asian financial hub in 2020 after months of anti-government protests. The law punishes acts including subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces, and extremism with up to life in prison.\nKEY QUOTES\nThe trauma of detention and continued surveillance left Chung with a feeling of “immense pressure and fear,” compelling him to leave, he told the newspaper.\nChung also said he was made to take part in a compulsory “deradicalization” program in detention.\nGuards “kept telling us (him and others in prison) that the United States government is really bad and that we had been manipulated by the United States,” Chung was quoted as saying. “We felt like we had to agree with them, that we couldn’t disagree or argue back.”\nChung was eventually released in June 2023 after his time was reduced for good behavior, according to the Washington Post. He plans to continue his studies and told the Post he will contribute everything he can in exile, “just as before.”\nCONTEXT\nChung is the former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism that dissolved in 2020 before the security law came into effect.\nProsecutors had said at the time he was charged that he acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party. They also said pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were seized from his home.\nThe former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise, an allegation that Beijing denies.\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio)",

    "title": "'There's So Much Of Us In This Novel', Union Minister Hardeep Puri Told Wife Lakshmi On Her Debut Fiction | MENAFN.COM",
    "text": "New Delhi, 14 March (IANS) While she wears many hats, and many addresses befit her, what do we call her? Mrs Puri or Ambassador Puri?“Lakshmi\", she insists, as she shares the stories behind the theme of her debut novel, 'Swallowing The Sun'. A top diplomat, gender rights advocate, the wife of a Union Minister, and a daughter to the parents who made her all that and more, Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri launched her first fiction 'Swallowing the Sun' (Aleph) earlier this year with much fanfare. But on Thursday evening, during a close and cozy gathering in the national capital, it was all about her and the stories she lived to create 'Swallowing the Sun'. The story, a historical fiction, is in many ways contemporary and forward-looking. This“coming of age” story of Malti, who is ahead of her times, is the thread of this“feminist” work. Education being an instrument for neutralising gender disparities, pursuing that on the eve of Independence was tantamount to taking part in a revolution to not subject a girl to child marriage and child motherhood, and make her identity secondary to the roles she did not choose to play. Lakshmi is a living example of this \"revolution\". And her story is the story of“sheroes”, her protagonist that explores heroism in her time and space. Raised in an intellectually stimulating household, Lakshmi delighted in her mother's storytelling and her“restrained” father's poetry. “We lived in poetry,” she said. With plentiful engagement and indulgence in poetry and literature, it was only too natural for her to have a flair for storytelling. Sparing a thought to the nearly extinct art of exchanging letters, which is largely the means of communication between the lovers in the story, the author seems to be fancying the idea of a book based only on letters. It was an editorial decision to cut down the number of letters in the novel that Lakshmi had to make peace with. Reading excerpts from the book where an angry Malti signs off to her lover with“Yours' sincerely\", instead of“Yours' affectionately\", was a reminder of how powerfully emotive letters could be. When Lakshmi finished writing the book, it was her husband, Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas and Housing and Urban Affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri, who first read the manuscript and said to his wife:“There is so much of us in this novel.” (Kavya Dubey may be reached at ...)

Share this: ROCHESTER, Minn. — People who are overall healthy and living with well-controlled Type 2 diabetes can donate a kidney, thanks to a change in national policy. The [Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network](https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/issa-naim-s-m-d/bio-20235178?mc_id=us&utm_source=newsnetwork&utm_medium=l&utm_content=content&utm_campaign=mayoclinic&geo=national&placementsite=enterprise&invsrc=other&cauid=100721) updated its [living donor criteria](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/d2hlvxv1/policy-notice_modify-ld-excl-crit_ldc.pdf) . It makes some people with Type 2 diabetes eligible to donate a kidney. This marks a \"significant shift\" in criteria for living kidney donors, says [Naim Issa, M.D.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/issa-naim-s-m-d/bio-20235178) , Mayo Clinic transplant nephrologist. \"This policy change may offer a lifeline to some people with end-stage kidney disease, providing them with a better chance for a successful transplant and improved quality of life,\" he says. Nearly 89,000 people in the U.S. are on the waiting list for a potentially lifesaving kidney transplant, according to the [United Network for Organ Sharing](https://unos.org/data/) . The average wait for a kidney from a deceased donor is three to five years. People who receive kidneys from living donors also tend to have better outcomes, says [Shennen Mao, M.D.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463?mc_id=us&utm_source=newsnetwork&utm_medium=l&utm_content=content&utm_campaign=mayoclinic&geo=national&placementsite=enterprise&invsrc=other&cauid=100721) , Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon. \"People in need of a kidney transplant typically receive a living donor transplant much faster than a deceased donor transplant, avoiding many years of dialysis and its associated complications,\" Dr. Mao says. \"On average, kidneys from living donors also last longer than those from deceased donors.\" What led to policy change? Historically, people with diabetes have been prohibited from being living kidney donors because diabetes can [cause kidney disease.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-nephropathy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354562?mc_id=us&utm_source=newsnetwork&utm_medium=l&utm_content=content&utm_campaign=mayoclinic&geo=national&placementsite=enterprise&invsrc=other&cauid=100721) People with Type 1 diabetes remain ineligible to be a living kidney donor. By expanding eligibility criteria, there's potential to save more lives through increased kidney availability while maintaining a commitment to the safety and well-being of donors. What is the policy? The national policy allows people with Type 2 diabetes to donate a kidney if there is no evidence of organ damage or an unacceptable lifetime risk of complications. Mayo Clinic Transplant Center adopted its own more stringent policies to minimize potential risks for the donor. In addition to national criteria, Mayo Clinic patients with Type 2 diabetes also must meet the following criteria to be a donor: - Be age 60 or older. - Have well-controlled diabetes and not use insulin. - If over age 65, can be using up to two oral medications for diabetes. - Not be overweight. - Have no family history of kidney disease. - Undergo a rigorous health assessment and individualized risk evaluation. \"Mayo Clinic donors undergo thorough health evaluations and risk assessments, ensuring that only those with minimal risk of complications are approved to donate,\" says [Pooja Budhiraja, M.B.B.S.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/budhiraja-pooja-m-b-b-s/bio-20486288?mc_id=us&utm_source=newsnetwork&utm_medium=l&utm_content=content&utm_campaign=mayoclinic&geo=national&placementsite=enterprise&invsrc=other&cauid=100721) , Mayo Clinic nephrologist. \"Criteria such as age limits, weight requirements and the absence of a family history of kidney disease help mitigate the long-term health risks for donors.

    "text": "Boston Dynamics y Toyota Research Institute ( TRI ) announced a new alliance to advance the development of humanoid robots by incorporating advanced artificial intelligence and cutting-edge robotic platforms. The main objective of this collaboration is to accelerate progress in general-purpose robotics and offer innovative solutions that improve people’s lives in everyday and industrial activities.\nThe technology partnership of Boston Dynamics and Toyota Research Institute This partnership lies in uniting the robot Atlas of Boston Dynamics known for its ability to perform complex tasks with extreme mobility, with large-scale behavioral models ( LBM ) from TRI, designed to improve the physical intelligence of robots. The integration of these technologies would allow explore new capabilities in humanoid robots especially in bimanual manipulation and the performance of complex physical tasks.\nRobert Playter, CEO de Boston Dynamics highlighted the impact of this alliance: “ We are excited to work together with TRI to tackle the most complex challenges in robotics. Our Atlas robot , together with TRI’s artificial intelligence, will allow us to develop new skills in robots that could revolutionize several sectors ”.\nFor his part, Gill Pratt, executive director of Toyota Research Institute highlighted the importance of implementing cutting-edge AI in highly advanced robots: “ We are at a key moment where artificial intelligence and robotics converge. Our collaboration with Boston Dynamics will allow us to amplify human capacity, improving both safety and quality of life through advanced automation ”.\nBoth companies have led the field of robotics in their respective areas. Boston Dynamics is recognized for its innovative Atlas humanoid platform, which has been developed to perform tasks that imitate human behavior with precision and efficiency. On the other hand, TRI has advanced applied AI, especially in multitasking model creation conditioned by vision and language, which allow robots to perform complex manipulations.\nThe project will focus on collecting data from the physical tasks performed by robots, to then train more advanced behavioral models. These models will be used to equip the humanoid robots with robust and agile abilities ready to be deployed in industrial and everyday environments.\nThis alliance represents an important step in the future of humanoid robotics, with implications for multiple industries, from manufacturing to healthcare. With the merger of Boston Dynamics and TRI, humanoid robots are expected to be able to perform tasks that previously seemed beyond the reach of machines, providing practical and effective solutions to improve human life.\nFollow us on social media and don’t miss any of our posts!\nYouTube LinkedIn Facebook Instagram X\nFuente: Toyota\nFoto: Boston Dynamics",
