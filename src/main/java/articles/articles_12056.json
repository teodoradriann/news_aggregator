    "text": "It was a Thursday night. Temperature was inching towards zero all afternoon. Wind chill factor high, yet cosy Gianninos was packed and the atmosphere was terrific. It was our first visit and we were impressed with the service and the food. We were with two regulars who have not had a bad meal there. A good recommendation. And the verdict? Good meal, great surroundings and really attentive, pleasant and efficient staff. It’s a extensive menu with 13 starters, you could, of course, have nibbles and there were six of them, and there were 15 pasta alternatives, 12 pizza (12in) alternatives plus four grill picks, plus sauces, three veal alternatives plus catch of the day fish and three other offers and three chicken choices. That’s more than enough for even the most discerning and picky diner. Cozze Marinara, freshly cooked mussels steamed in white wine, garlic, tomato sauce, served with a slice of home made Italian bread was irresistible. It lived up to expectations and we had to use the spoon provided to scoop up the juice. Prociutto Melone was another pick and was well received and then on to mains. Two rump steaks – no sauce – were appreciated, big beefy flavour and juicy, and so was the pollo surf and turf, chicken with king prawns with pancetta, garlic, wine and chilli served with potatoes and veg. The house penne also went down well. No room for desert for three but one could not resist the apple pie and, on this occasion, custard. Enjoyable? Yes, and we were one of the last to leave.

    "title": "CBN Gummies To Improve Sleep Quality: Natural Restful Sleep Solutions Announced | FinancialContent Business Page",
    "text": "The Trusted Lab announces a new product line of Good Night CBN Gummies, a natural remedy developed to improve sleep quality.\nIrving, United States - April 4, 2024 —\nThe recently released, all-natural sleep aids harness the sleep-enhancing benefits of CBN (cannabinol) in combination with CBD (cannabidiol). Together, the two compounds work synergistically to promote deep, restful sleep and relaxation. The gummies support the body’s natural sleep mechanisms for refreshing and rejuvenating rest and a better start to the day upon waking.\nMore details are available at https://www.thetrustedlab.com/product/good-night-cbn-gummies-150-mg/\nEach gummy is carefully crafted from high-quality, lab-tested, organic, gluten-free ingredients and contains five milligrams of fast-acting CBN. One jar of Good Night CBN Gummies contains 30 pieces for a total of 150 milligrams of CBN, The Trusted Lab says.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one-third of adults report they often don’t get enough sleep to be at their best the next day. Such a high proportion of sleep-deprived adults suggests natural sleep remedies would be welcome on the market.\nThe Trusted Lab’s Good Night CBN Gummies may be a superior alternative to melatonin-containing sleep aids. For some consumers, these supplements may have side effects such as headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and some users may develop dependency on them.\nThe company recommends users take one or two gummies with food just before bed and allow 15 minutes for maximum absorption. They also note that users should always listen to their bodies and adjust the dosage accordingly. The gummies are made from the highest-quality CBN concentrate, ensuring high absorption and bio-availability.\nAbout The Trusted Lab\nThe Trusted Lab crafts premium, hemp-derived CBD products for better health, relaxation, and performance. The manufacturing process is completely controlled by the company to ensure products’ maximum purity and potency. All products contain no more than 0.3% THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and are independently third-party tested.\n“The Trusted Lab was founded to provide you the highest-quality, organic, natural, lab-tested, and safe American-grown hemp CBD products in the market today,” a company representative said. “Our powerful tinctures, edibles, and topical creams are the result of months of research and development, leading to top-of-the-line products for each of our categories. Every single product on our website has been tested for potency, quality and consumer tested.”\nInterested parties can learn more at https://www.thetrustedlab.com/product/good-night-cbn-gummies-150-mg/\nContact Info:\nName: Bianca Allison\nEmail: Send Email\nOrganization: The Trusted Lab\nAddress: 1251 East Airport Freeway, Irving, Texas 75062, United States\nPhone: +1-909-328-6829\nWebsite: https://www.thetrustedlab.com/\nSource: PressCable\nRelease ID: 89126311\nShould you detect any errors, issues, or discrepancies with the content contained within this press release, or if you need assistance with a press release takedown, we kindly request that you inform us immediately by contacting error@releasecontact.com .

    "text": "NFL fans are already getting worried about\nJoe Burrow after a worrisome video from Cincinnati Bengals practice yesterday surfaced.\nJoe Burrow missed the Bengals’ final 10 games in 2023 after suffering a wrist injury in a Thursday night game against the\nBaltimore Ravens. Burrow underwent season-ending surgery, and the Bengals missed the postseason after finishing 9-8.\nWell, NFL fans are already growing concerned for Burrow after his pass protection quickly broke down in a drill during yesterday’s training camp session. Here’s a video of the drill, courtesy of WCPO’s Caleb Noe:\nThis one short video clip was enough to start sending NFL fans into panic mode on Joe Burrow’s behalf:\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google!\nFollow Us\nAlso Read:\n Bengals QB Joe Burrow Reveals The Most Hilarious Reason For Dying His Hair Bleach Blonde And Going For The Eminem Look\nJoe Burrow has already been sacked 148 times in 52 games, per\nPro Football Reference. This included a league-high 51 sacks taken in the 2021 season to go along with 19 sacks in four playoff games.\n2023 marked the second time in four years where Burrow suffered a season-ending injury. He tore his ACL and MCL during his 2020 rookie season, having taken 32 sacks in just 10 games.\nCincinnati signed veteran offensive tackle Trent Brown and used their first-round pick on Amarius Mims to shore up the o-line depth. But only time will tell if de facto GM Duke Tobin and company did enough to ensure Burrow has adequate pass protection here in 2024.\nBengals Will Contend If Joe Burrow Stays Healthy\nIf Joe Burrow can stay healthy, the Bengals will unquestionably be one of the top players for the Super Bowl this year. In his two healthy seasons, Cincinnati has played in two AFC Championship Games and one Super Bowl.\nBurrow also holds a 3-1 record against Patrick Mahomes and the\nKansas City Chiefs, with all three games being decided by a single score. So if he’s on the field, the Bengals are by far Kansas City’s biggest threat in the AFC.\nAlso Read:\nRUMOR: Two Interesting AFC Teams Planning To Go “All-In” For Bengals Superstar WR Tee Higgins",

    "text": "Crackdown on illegal MTP centres: 379 shut, 16 suspended in state\nIn a move to strengthen efforts toward improving the state's sex ratio, a meeting of the State Task Force (STF) was held under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Sudhir Rajpal. The meeting focused on reviewing the current status and identifying targeted interventions in areas with skewed sex ratios.\nKuldeep Singh, Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Haryana, informed the task force that village-wise data on sex ratio from 2019 to March 2025 has been compiled. “Special attention will be given to villages showing persistently low sex ratios,” he said.\nVirender Yadav, convener of the STF, said the state’s sex ratio, as per the Civil Registration System (CRS) portal data up to April 22, 2025, stands at 911 females per 1,000 males. He disclosed a significant disciplinary action, stating, “Licence of one BAMS doctor in Sonepat district has been cancelled by the Council of Indian Medicine, Haryana, for violating provisions of the PC & PNDT Act and the MTP Act.”\nIn a broader crackdown on non-compliant facilities, Yadav said, “Out of the 1,500 MTP centres in Haryana, 379 have been closed, and the registration of 16 centres suspended in the past one month. There is a declining trend in the sale of MTP kits in Haryana.”\nA show-cause notice has also been issued to the Drug Control Officer (DCO) of Sonepat for submitting an unverified or incomplete report and for failing to ensure that MTP kits are sold only through registered MTP centres.\nHighlighting further regulatory measures, Yadav said, “Pre-implantation Genetic Testing (PGT) must be conducted only with approval from the competent authority. The outcome of each In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) procedure is to be reported to the respective Civil Surgeon every month.”\nTo improve ground-level oversight, districts have now been assigned to officers from the State Drug Controller’s Office, who will conduct field visits to monitor and prevent the unauthorised or illegal sale of MTP kits.\nAll Civil Surgeons have been directed to closely monitor MTP kit sales in their respective districts. In addition, special Beti Bachao Beti Padhao camps will be organised on April 25 in villages with a sex ratio below 700, jointly managed by the Senior Medical Officer (SMO) of the local Community Health Centre (CHC) and the Programme Officer (PO) from the Women and Child Development (WCD) Department.",

    "text": "CENTURION, Dec 28: Jasprit Bumrah lacked support from other end as there was no reason to concede 400 plus runs on a bowling friendly track where South African speedsters showed how to go about the job, a dejected Indian skipper Rohit Sharma said on Thursday. India lost the opening Test inside three days by an innings and 32 runs after scoring 245 and 131 in the two innings but the game-changer certainly was being taken for 408 runs by South Africa in their first innings. Save Bumrah, who took four wickets and to an extent Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur and Prasidh Krishna got pasting of their lives. “This was not a 400-run wicket and we gave too many runs. We sprayed the ball all around, but it happens. One can’t depend on one particular bowler (Bumrah), the other three pacers also needed to perform their roles, we could learn from how South Africa bowled,” Rohit said after the match. He admitted that although there wasn’t lack of effort but Bumrah couldn’t alone keep the pressure on Proteas batters. “Bumrah bowled well and we all know his quality. All he wanted was a bit of support which he didn’t get. That happens. All three tried hard, bending their backs but didn’t happen the way we wanted to. But games like these teaches you a lot as to what you want to do as a bowling unit,” the skipper observed. Young Prasidh, who has just had 12 first-class matches under his belt, couldn’t get the measure of bounce and carry at Supersport Park and went for 93 runs in 20 overs on Test debut. The skipper conceded Prasidh is a bit under-cooked but also insisted that his team would show faith in him. “Of course, he is a little bit inexperienced. He has got the tools to come out here and play the game. Obviously, if I look at the bowlers that we have back in India, some of them are injured, some not available, so we tried picking guys who are available, based on conditions,” he reasoned. “I completely agree that he (Krishna) hasn’t played a lot of (red ball) cricket but there are three guys in their team also, who haven’t played a lot of (red ball cricket) but they showed what is required. “More than what’s there in the legs, I think it’s in the mind. How you treat your mind and how you play the game is more important. If you think that oh, I haven’t played, lot of Tests or FC cricket, then it’s not going to help,” the skipper was clear. “When you get an opportunity, you should be grateful and come out and do the job for the team. Obviously, it didn’t work out well for him and playing your first game, we all would have been nervous, he would have been nervous as well. “These things happen, the guy has game to excel but we will back him and has a great attitude about his game which holds us in good stead going forward.” Batters need to devise own gameplan",
