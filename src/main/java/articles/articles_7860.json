    "text": "Aoife Johnston\nA VERDICT OF medical misadventure has been returned at the inquest into the death of teenager Aoife Johnston at University Hospital Limerick in 2022.\nThe verdict is unopposed by the HSE and UL Hospitals Group.\nAoife died of bacterial meningitis, after a 12-hour wait in the hospital’s emergency department, on 19 December 2022, which was overcrowded at the time.\nShe had initially presented to the hospital on 17 December, and was eventually admitted to intensive care, but passed away shortly after.\nThe inquest which has taken place this past week has been another period in which the family of Aoife Johnston have experienced great distress, and this has been publicly visible to all of us.\nIn a statement this afternoon, HSE CEO Bernard Gloster said he wanted to “restate for the record our unequivocal apology, conscious that no words” will take away the pain of Aoife’s family and friends.\nGloster thanked the Coroner for “his careful attention to this tragic case” and remarked that over the past four days, “we have heard great detail on the events surrounding this unnecessary death”.\nGloster added: “I know we have considerable work to do to ensure that the people of the Mid West, and the staff of University Hospital Limerick, have a service they can feel confident in and proud of, and we are working to that end.\n“The details of this inquest will be very much in our minds as we do so.”\nMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly offered his condolences to Aoife’s parents and sisters in a statement this afternoon.\n“I met with Aoife’s parents in January and my thoughts are with them after what must have been an immensely difficult week,” Donnelly said.\nHe thanked the Coroner for his work, “but I am aware that nothing will ever make up for the enormous loss the Johnston family has experienced”.\nHe said the Coroner’s recommendations will be fully considered, along with the work of retired Chief Justice Frank Clarke who is due to conclude his independent investigation in the coming weeks.\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said urgent government action is required to “address the health crisis in Limerick and the Mid West”.\nShe also called on the government to immediately review the re-opening of emergency departments in Ennis and Nenagh.\n“Aoife Johnston’s death was an avoidable tragedy,” said the Sinn Féin leader.\n“Aoife and her family’s experience at University Hospital Limerick was one of acute trauma. They have had to relive that trauma this week, and no doubt relive it every day.”\nMcDonald added: “It is clear that Aoife’s death was a result of catastrophic system failure which resulted in an emergency department that was overcrowded, understaffed, and completely unsafe.\n“Aoife’s case speaks in the most heartbreaking way to the depths of the crisis at University Hospital Limerick.\n“The chaos in the emergency department that Aoife and her family faced that weekend is what faces patients and staff all the time.”\nShe added that the recruitment embargo in University Hospital Limerick “needs to be lifted and 288 beds need to be delivered”.",

    "title": "Jaishankar says Global South believes in India; China does not participate in voicing their concerns - Defence News | The Financial Express",
    "text": "Highlighting India’s leadership in the Global South, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday said the 125 countries of the platform placed their trust in India and that China skipped the two meetings convened by India last year to listen to their concerns. Addressing the Nikkei Forum on the India-Japan partnership here, India’s top diplomat said that countries of the Global South feel for each other on several issues.“On a lot of issues, these countries feel for each other. The feeling has been intensified by COVID because many countries of the Global South felt that they were the last in the line to get the vaccine. They even felt at the time when India became G20 President that their concerns were not even on the agenda of the G20.“So we did last year two meetings of the voice of the Global South because we wanted to listen to these 125 countries and then put before the G20 a set of issues which were the collective views of these 125 countries.Within Asia and Africa, Global South is very popular in those continents. They know exactly what is happening, who’s speaking up for them, and how their issues are getting on the table.“They don’t think it is a coincidence that it was under the Indian presidency that the African Union, which had long been promised a seat in the G20, got a seat. So the Global South believes us,” he said.“The two summits which we convened last year to listen to their concerns, I don’t believe China was present,” Jaishankar said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping not attending the G20 summit and deputing Premier Li Qiang instead.About India’s relationship with Russia and its criticism of Moscow’s war in Ukraine, he said: “Sometimes in world politics, countries pick one issue, one situation, one principle and they highlight it because it suits them. But if one looks at the principle itself, we in India know better than almost any other country.“Immediately after our independence, we experienced aggression, an effort to change our boundaries and even today parts of India are occupied by another country but we did not see the world respond saying, oh, there’s a great principle involved and therefore, let us all go with India.“Today we are being told that there are principles involved. I wish I’d seen that principle in play for the last 80 years. I’ve seen those principles cherry-picked,” Jaishankar said.“I would say injustice was done to us. I’m not advocating it should be done to everybody else. We have been very clear. My Prime Minister has stood next to President Putin and said we want to see the end to this conflict,” he said.Talking about India’s strategic importance as an Asian neighbour, the minister said: “Due to the tragic conflict taking place in Ukraine, energy costs went up, food costs went up, fertiliser costs went up and a country like Sri Lanka had this huge economic crisis. If you see which countries stepped forward to help Sri Lanka, India put together a package within a matter of a few weeks, in fact, a few months which was four and a half billion dollars. Just so that you understand, the IMF packet which took much longer was less than USD 3 billion. So our direct bilateral support we gave to Sri Lanka was 50 per cent larger than what the IMF gave.” Jaishankar said that India as a big economy understood its obligations and took its Global South responsibility very seriously.“We do recognise today that as a big economy, we have more responsibilities. But I also would like the world to recognise that we may be a big economy but we are still an economy whose per capita income is below USD 3,000. So when we give something to the world, it is done with a great deal of sacrifice and a great effort on the part of the people of India. Indians’ sense of international obligation is very strong. As I said during vaccination while we had not completed our vaccination yet we gave vaccines. So we take our global south responsibility very, very seriously.” In response to a question whether India would impose sanctions on China if it invaded Taiwan, Jaishanakr said: “Let me make two or three observations here. By and large, it has not been India’s foreign policy method. We rarely do sanctions.” China views Taiwan, a self-governing island, as a rebel province that must be reunified with the mainland even by force.“The sanctions are something which is very much rooted in a Western way or I would say a G7 way of working because they control the means to apply the sanctions. I’m trying to think the only time when we have very strongly advocated sanctions ourselves was against South Africa during the apartheid period when most of the developed countries did not want to do sanctions.“In today’s situation, there is a big debate about whether sanctions work or they don’t work. What is the cost? What is the cost to people? I just want to make one point: it has nothing to do with Taiwan or China or Russia.” Talking as to how a stable government can significantly carve a country’s foreign policy, Jaishankar said: “Every country, every society is different. So what can apply to India need not always be the same for other countries. But our own experience is that the lack of stability in politics affects foreign diplomacy. To have majorities in Parliament to take bold steps makes a very big difference. Here, I am certain that we have a stable government for at least a decade or even more.” He said huge changes were happening in terms of development in India and that India’s economy was growing rapidly along with employment opportunities.“And that is one of the changes which is happening today. Today India stands third in the number of startups in the world and the number of unicorns which have come up in this period is inspirational. On the semiconductor side, this is the industry of the future. This is where the jobs will grow. We’ve had companies from abroad actually employ people in India,” he said. PTI",

    "text": "A Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment blueprint should limit sharing sensitive business information with the AI assistant.\nThis week’s Microsoft Ignite conference focused on the challenge of internal oversharing. Indeed, sharing too much sensitive data poses significant security risks and can clash with corporate guidelines. In theory, this increases the likelihood of data breaches or misuse. Moreover, when sensitive information is shared with generative AI, there is a risk that it could end up outside the organization.\nMicrosoft’s new blueprint thus aims to counter oversharing by guiding the pilot, implementation, and operational phases of Copilot.\nThe three phases\nIn the pilot phase, companies follow steps to set up Microsoft 365 Copilot. The blueprint recommends identifying the most used and potentially at-risk SharePoint sites. Based on this analysis, which sites can or cannot be accessed by Copilot during the testing period can be determined. This process is carried out with a limited group of users so that any adjustments can be made easily.\nIn the implementation phase, Copilot is rolled out organization-wide. This phase focuses primarily on identifying oversharing risks and restricting access to sensitive information. This helps prevent inadvertent data sharing. Finally, the operational phase focuses on generating regular oversharing reports. These reports allow you to identify potential risks and take corrective action.",

    "title": "El chocolate en polvo que sí tiene cacao, es mejor que el Abuelita y tiene aval de Profeco en $26",
    "text": "¿Siempre preparas tu chocolate con el de Abuelita, pero quieres probar una marca mejor? [La Profeco estudió varios tipos de chocolate ](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/estilo-de-vida/2024/10/21/que-ingredientes-tiene-el-peor-chocolate-en-polvo-segun-la-profeco-837816.html)y el de esta marca sí se llevó el aval, además de que sí contiene cacao, contrario a muchos otros analizados, y cuesta sólo 26 pesos. Un delicioso chocolate calientito se debe preparar con una buena tablilla o chocolate granulado. Si eres fan de este tipo de bebidas, sabes que no todos los chocolates son igual de buenos para agregarles leche, por eso la Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor sometió a varias pruebas a 32 productos y no todos resultaron cumplir con las normas, como el Abuelita. ¿Cuál es el chocolate con aval de la Profeco, mejor que el Abuelita? No obstante, el de Great Value se llevó la 'palomita' ya que no sólo tiene bien su etiquetado, cumple con lo que promete y la mayoría de su contenido está entre los mínimos y máximos permitidos. Para determinar si un chocolate es \"bueno\" o no, la Profeco estudió la información comercial de cada marca, el contenido energético, la proteína, azúcares y grasa. Hubo exámenes que se llevaron a cabo en la presentación original y también caliente, en leche descremada y licuado. Te podría interesar ¿Qué tan bueno es el chocolate en polvo de Great Value? El chocolate que logró pasar bien por todas las pruebas fue el Great Value en polvo granulado. Este productor, según señaló la Profeco en la Revista al Consumidor, cumple con la información de su etiquetado y pasó todas las pruebas de la Profeco. ¿Qué contiene el chocolate de Great Value? De acuerdo a la Procuraduría, el contenido de este chocolate por cada 100 gramos de producto, es: - Azúcares: 85.3 gramos - Contenido energético: 418 kcal. Si lo preparas en leche descremada, el contenido por cada 100 ml, según la Profeco, sería: - Grasa: 1.3 gramos - Azúcar: 12.0 gramos - Proteína: 3.8 gramos - Contenido energético: 75 kcal. El motivo por el que es mejor que el Abuelita se debe a que no cumple con la información completa para el consumidor ya que no tiene el sello de \"Exceso de calorías\". Y es que, de acuerdo a lo que dijo la Procuraduría, es de 418 kcal, lo mismo que el Great Value, pero la diferencia es que el Great Value sí tiene el etiquetado correcto. ¿Cuál es el chocolate de Great Value que sólo cuesta 26 pesos? El precio del chocolate Great Value en polvo es de sólo 26 pesos en la presentación de 320 gramos, que es mucho menor al de otros productos similares. Ahora ya sabes cuál es uno de las mejores marcas en polvo para que te prepares tu chocolate calientito, pero[ si no quieres dejar el Abuelita, esta es una receta para que te salga delicioso y espumoso](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/estilo-de-vida/2024/7/10/el-secreto-para-hacer-chocolate-abuelita-espumoso-con-el-delicioso-toque-tradicional-823852.html).",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#1](c1#c-1) país que vive en gran parte del turismo alentando cargarse el turismo.\nNada nuevo señores, es la izquierda y es España\nYa subiremos los impuestos\n[#18](c18#c-18) cuatro gatos viven del turismo???? jajaja 14% del pib estatal depende de esa actividad, en el caso de solo Andalucía es aún mayor, con los millones de puestos de trabajo asociados a esa actividad solo de forma directa. Si sumamos a eso todas las actividades económicas que se generan a partir de eso, el porcentaje económico y de puestos de trabajo es enorme.\nIdea brillante la tuya, pero que sepas que primero se hundirá el turismo y después irá tu sector, no te quepa duda.\n[#53](c53#c-53) El porcentaje de empleos del sector del turismo en España es del 12.5%, en Andalucía en concreto el 17%.\nHacen un total de 2.550.000 trabajadores solo de forma directa. Diles tú a todos esos y sus familias que el mundo continua perfectamente igual con ellos en el paro, a ver que te dicen.\n[#58](c58#c-58) No subió el paro porque no hubo despidos por los ERTES y la deuda apenas subió. La realidad es que durante la pandemia España siguió funcionando sin hostelería ni turismo. La construcción funcionaba, la industria funcionaba, funcionamos todos menos hostelería y turismo y qué pasó? Nada. Y ten claro una cosa; como estalle un conflicto serio en Europa y tambores suenan, el turismo se acaba de un plumazo.\nEl turismo ha de ser un complemento, no un pilar económico y mucho menos permitir que pase por encima del bienestar de una mayoría del país. Y se ha vuelto un atropello en todos los sentidos.\n[#67](c67#c-67) La deuda apenas subió, solamente del 98% al 120% (sobre el PIB). El paro solamente subió de un 13% a un 16%. Poca cosa, 2 o 3 hilitos de plastilina.\nLo mejor es seguir viviendo de ERTEs ya que supongo que en tu cabeza los hizo un mago.\nEn cuanto al comentario sobre el turismo estoy de acuerdo. En lo único que no es un dato es en lo que dices la verdad, que ya manda huevos. El Gobierno no solo la luchado para no vivir del Turismo y generar empleo precario, sino que además lo ha fortificado.\n[#70](c70#c-70) Del 2008 al 2010 se duplicó la deuda y siguió creciendo. Eso es aumentar deuda. En una pandemia, invertir en tu propio capital humano vía ERTES, fue una inversión, aumentó deuda para posteriormente descender vía fortaleza laboral (e inflación). Y hablar de un 3% de incremento de paro en una pandemia con confinamiento es percata minuta. Las cifras depende de cómo las presentes pueden parecer una u otra cosa.\nY que conste que a mí el sector turismo siempre me ha parecido algo positivo hasta que han metido el turismo en nuestras casas, literalmente vía viviendas turísticas, con todo lo que ello conlleva. El turismo ha de ser un complemento, España tiene potencial para más sectores y me consta que el Industrial vuelve a crecer, más con la lotería de energía casi gratis vía renovables, deberíamos de ser un motor industrial de Europa, no sólo la sala de fiestas.\n[#88](c88#c-88) Primero, que coño me hablas de cambio climático en una noticia de malagueños cansado de los putos guiris?\nSegundo, donde he negado yo el cambio climático?\nTercero, cuanto le sacaron de indemnización al pediatra por resbalarte de sus brazos y el golpe en la cabeza?\nPosmo al rescate del posmo usando hombres de paja. Algunos no dais para más.\n[#18](c18#c-18) hijo mio españa es turismo , mira el pib, culpa de los politicos que no saben fomentar otra cosa\nCuando la \"izquierda\" posmoderna se vende y pierde la conciencia de clase tenemos comentarios tan asquerosos como este:\n[#18](c18#c-18)\nNo fuiste, ni eres, ni serás de \"izquierdas\" en tu vida, eres un votante del partido demócrata norteamericano.\nMillones de compatriotas tuyos viven del puto turismo. 4 gatos son tus representantes en el parlamento, no los que viven del turismo.\n[#16](c16#c-16) no le quites la heroina a un heroinomano, ¿no ves que depende de ella y que si no va colocado no funciona?\n[#16](c16#c-16) patriota que presume de patria pero vendiendo España\nNada nuevo señores, es la derecha y es SU España\nYa socializaremos los impuestos para compensar(nos a nosotros mismos)\n[#16](c16#c-16) pues el mercado se auto regulará el solo, si no hay turismo habrá que buscar otras formas de riqueza y empleo, no es la máxima neoliberal?\n[#16](c16#c-16) a lo mejor se podría vivir de un turismo de calidad en lugar de turismo de vuelos baratos y borrachera. Habrá gente que viva del turismo (aunque la mayoría del empleo que genera sea de malisima calidad), pero también hay gente que sufre el turismo y la gentrificacion que conlleva.\nSi más de la mitad de los guiris no vinieran a España de vacaciones, yo me alegraría.\n[#32](c32#c-32) el turismo cada vez es más calidad, cada vez deja más dinero\nTú cuando viajas gastas mucho??? Eres turista de calidad???\nEs por saber\n[#16](c16#c-16) Lo que quisiera la derecha es un país de putas y camareros.\nPues lo siento, en Málaga están evolucionando a ser una ciudad tecnológica por mucho que eso les duela a los que pagan cinco o seis euros la hora.\n[#33](c33#c-33) Lo que quiere la derecha es fortalecer al sector privado, al contrario que la izquierda, que quiere parasitarlo y hundirlo\n[#91](c91#c-91) para parásito de lo público la derechita española, eh? a quién sino se le ocurrió lo del impuesto al sol para que no perdieran ni media las eléctricas? en cuanto que el negocio pierde \"el debido rigor o se afloja\" rápido que váis a su rescate con, SIIII, DINERO PÚBLICO. Tienes una jeta que te la pisas.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Los que odian a los turistas, los que se manifiesten contra ellos, se merecen que se queden sin turismo.\nYo me considero turista, cuando tomo \"vacaciones\" es de menos de un día de duración. Voy en tren a una ciudad, visito sus monumentos, museos, playas, parques, etc. Es algo que me gusta. A mí no me gustaría que me tachasen de criminal solo por viajar a una ciudad en la que no residoy comer en un restaurante o tomarme un helado.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Lo es chusco es como hay xenofobias buenas. Voy a cooiar el texto cambiando algunas palabras\nLos immigrantes han sido calificados como una ‘plaga’ por los lugareños en el sur de España antes de una gran protesta planeada para este fin de semana.\nEscribió: “Nuestro café central ahora se llama La luna de Tetuan y a las 11 de la mañana apesta a moros y a tes morunos\n“Se han cargado nuestra identidad, han prostituido todo lo que han podido a nuestra ciudad. Esto merece un cambio.”\nMoro es un término utilizado para describir a los immigrantes típicamente marroquies u otros del norte de Africa.\nSe insta a los manifestantes a reunirse en la Plaza de la Merced este sábado, donde se espera que levanten pancartas y canten consignas anti-immigracion.\nOtros lugareños respondieron al post de Navarrete, uno calificando a los ‘moros’ como una ‘plaga’.\nJesús Toboada escribió: “El centro de Granada apesta a bares con menús en arabe. En lugar de bares tradicionales con tapas y bocadillos, están proliferando locales de kebabs, restaurantes de cuscus y bares donde no pueden entrar las mujeres.\n“Los moros están menospreciando a los locales en su propia ciudad.”\n[#1](c1#c-1) Lo es chusco es como hay xenofobias buenas.

Unos pocos sacan tajada, los demás protestan y esos pocos dicen que si no se abren en canal al turismo descontrolado se van a quedar sin trabajo y a la vez tienen untados a los políticos para seguir manteniendo el chiringuito, sean extranjeros o nacionales. Si son tantos pueden ponerse de acuerdo en votar a alguien que cambie la situación o incluso montar un partido para solucionar este problema. Lo que no se puede hacer es protestar y poner a dirigir a gente que ha creado y promueve esta situación.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Yo eso de culpar a la ciudadanía que por tener derecho a voto se merece cualquier cosa que le pase me suena a psicopatía.\nNingún programa electoral habla de \"turistificar\" el centro, tenemos unos añitos ya para creer en promesas electorales del mismo modo que tampoco creemos en los Reyes Magos y conocemos un caso reciente de que cuando un partido le toca las bolas al poder de verdad, al del IBEX, ese que no necesita presentarse a las elecciones, lo hunden desde los medios, la policía y la judicatura.\nPues oye, ciduadanía y democracia no se limita a unas elecciones, también incluye organizarse, protestar, hacer manifestaciones, boicotts y, en este caso, hacerle entender al turista que no es bienvenido.\nSi pesras que esto se resuelva en unas elecciones, coge sitio y échate a vegetar.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"hacerle entender al turista que no es bienvenido\", eso es un error de base, el turista jamás pero jamás se siente responsable de la turistificación masiva, siempre piensa que un sitio masificado o degradado es por los demás, el nunca se siente partícipe de eso, sino más bien, y como mucho, se siente víctima, pues se suele percibir como que él es un viajero especial, no un turista más.\nAdemás, en el caso de que haga todas las turistadas y se le señale por parte de los locales, tampoco se sentirá responsable, porque pensará que total, por 3 días que voy a estar aquí no contribuyo al deterioro, eso serán los demás que están más tiempo que yo.\nAdemás, si ve carteles o pintadas en contra de los turistas una vez que está ya en el lugar eso no va a hacer que deje de ir a los sitios que pensaba ir, y cuando vuelva a su casa y sus amigos le pregunten que tal la experiencia la anécdota de las 4 pintadas que vio contra el turismo le van a parecer del todo insignificantes, ni siquiera las nombrará cuando cuente su viaje a sus allegados.\nEn fin, hacerle sentir al turista que no es bienvenido es un acto totalmente en vano, cuanto antes os deis cuenta antes dejaréis de perder el tiempo.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Según leo en otra noticia, en las últimas elecciones la oposición hizo bandera de ir contra el problema. No sé si habrían hecho algo una vez elegidos, pero mucho no le preocupa a la mayoría de votantes si votan a quien además niega que el turismo sea un problema.\n\"Hace ya tiempo, años, que la falta de vivienda asequible, en compra o alquiler, es tema principal en Málaga. Lo es entre los políticos (fue bandera de la oposición en la campaña electoral de las pasadas elecciones municipales) pero, sobre todo, entre la ciudadanía\"\n\"El PP rechaza en Pleno las mociones que vinculan la falta de precios asequibles al turismo masivo\"\nhttps://www.eldiario.es/andalucia/malaga/malaga-prepara-gran-manifestacion-vivienda-situacion-colapso_1_11483399.html\n[#72](c72#c-72) En mi ayuntamiento gobierna el PsoE con Podemos (y Nueva Canarias) desde hace dos legislaturas y el Airbnb de los huevos y el turismeo son plaga.\nEsto se resuelve con movilización ciudadana.\nLos lugareños todavía no han entendido que los dueños de los negocios locales, si tienen que elegir, eligen a los guiris. Y prueba de ello es que el dueño de ese café tradicional ha preferido que su negocio ahora se llame John Pollas y huela a mierda a las 11 de la mañana. Igual pasa con las viviendas, que los propietarios han decidido que prefieren alquilárselas a un turista antes que a un local. Y es que los empresarios son solo amigos del dinero, no de sus conciudadanos (estos últimos solo los quieren para explotarlos laboralmente)\nAsí que ahora el lugareño que la chupe muy fuerte y que disfrute del capitalismo salvaje que ha votado durante todo estos años y que, a buen seguro, seguirá votando, porque... ¡¡¡COMUNISMO!!!.\nA llorar y a tomar por culo todos.\n“Se han cargado nuestra identidad, han prostituido todo lo que han podido a\nnuestra su ciudad. Esto merece un cambio.”\nEl centro de la ciudad es ahora un centro de ocio y ya no pertenece a los habitantes que quedan, fue vendida. Y realmente tampoco la queréis recuperar. A veces no se puede tener todo.\n[#4](c4#c-4) \" A veces no se puede tener todo\"\nunos pocos han sacado tajada al turismo, con pisos turísticos, negocios orientados al turismo etc otros pues se han comido las consecuencias de alquileres inflados, precios en los locales más caros etc\nNo se las proporciones de turistas extranjeros o nacionales. Yo estuve en Málaga hace poco en un piso turístico y había mucho turismo nacional también. No se hasta que punto se le puede echar la culpa a los británicos. Había mucho alemán, holandés....\n[#21](c21#c-21) Es la tragedia de los comunes, no el capitalismo. Es, como en todo ejemplo de este estilo, un problema de asignación de derechos de propiedad y de internalización de costes.\nReduciéndolo mucho, si hacer el cafre en España no fuera tan barato porque se multara como es debido todo comportamiento incívico esos comportamientos no se darían. Y seguirías teniendo el mismo modelo económico, pero sin los problemas que aquí presenciamos.\nEl camino no es echar al turista (actitud hiper xenofoba, todo sea dicho) sino sancionar al incívico, ya sea turista o local.\n[#62](c62#c-62) Estamos hablando de turistas britanicos, no de britanicos. No se donde ves el racismo.\nNo se, me sorprende que me digas eso, porue tu de racismo sabes un rato largo. DSobretodo cuando son de piel oscura\nYo hablo de esta gentuza:\nLa queja de los turistas británicos sobre Benidorm: \"demasiados españoles\"\nhttps://viajar.elperiodico.com/escapate_cerca/queja-turistas-britanicos-benidorm-espanoles-104037456\n[#78](c78#c-78) Te voy a poner una denuncia por insultarme. Por llamarme racista. Voy a abrir una queja formal a los administradores.\nYo solamente soy religionófobo, odio todas las religiones. Y el islam está entre ellas. Y también odio la delincuencia sea de la clase social que sea. En este foro se suele hacer apología a la delincuencia pero hasta aquí hemos llegado. Llamando plaga a seres humanos como si de insectos se trataran. Voy a denunciar todo lo que vea que pueda herir la sensibilidad de otras personas. Se acabó el discurso del odio y de insultar gratuitamente.\nSE ACABÓ.\n[#79](c79#c-79) siento decirte que como troll no das la talla...\nDenuncia lo que quieras, con suerte se le hincha la vena al admin de turno que la atienda, y te cae un bonito strike a ti.\nNo hay rascar demasiado en tu historico de comentarios para encontrar motivos para ello...\n\"Se acabó el discurso del odio y de insultar gratuitamente\"\nEmpieza por aplicarte el cuento\nEste tipo de noticias llegará algún día, más ahora que la gente está quemada con el turismo --->; apalizan a un grupo de turistas borrachos que armaban escándalo.\nLuego la noticia correrá como la pólvora por el resto del mundo y con suerte, se perderá mucho turismo.\nEs lo que tiene matar a la vaca en vez de ordeñarla. Y la vaca del turismo ya está más muerta que viva.\nEn Alemania también les hacen pain au chocolat a los gabachos turistas y en cambio, en Francia, sauerkraut con cerveza en París o es que el sur de España y levante es subnormal?\nPorque más de turismo es como si os estuvieran montando un Gibraltar II sin cambiar fronteras. Con la cultura de UK con los beneficios sociales de España sin balancear lo producido.\nImagina que en Iparralde se pusieran a vender chocolate con churros. Que sí, que hay cercanía e intercambio vasco, pero es como si pusieran 20 casas Paco en Biarritz para el turista cántabro con pintxos, tapas y anchoas.\nJesús Toboada escribió: “El centro de Granada apesta a bares con menús en inglés. En lugar de bares tradicionales con tapas y bocadillos, están proliferando locales de hamburguesas, restaurantes de sushi y tiendas que venden turrón en pleno verano.”\nUy uy uy, en el momento en el que aparecen las tiendas de turrón es porque ya hay metástasis, crudo lo tienen. Queda poco para dentro de los patios se encuentren con un starbucks, un tacobell...\n[#43](c43#c-43) no sufras que el comentario original tampoco es que estuviese escrito muy allá, a pesar de que en el norte montañés leen todo el rato a Kierkegaard\n[#23](c23#c-23) eso dicen los British, es que los demás les tienen manía. Van a ver un partido de fútbol y sólo les pillan a ellos sin ejtradas. Hay hostias en un partido europeo y uno casi siempre es británico.\nEtc\nSi yo quisiera joder a Egpaña haría una campaña en redes contra su principal fuente de ingresos que es el turismo y seguro que con la argumentación adecuada más de un subnormal se unía ... Ah, veo que llego tarde ...\n“Se han cargado nuestra identidad, han prostituido todo lo que han podido a nuestra ciudad. Esto merece un cambio.” Argumentos que aplicados a otro tipo de \"turistas\" del tercer mundo sería considerado xenofobia ... es burdo pero vamos con ello ...\nClaro que hay que cambiar el modelo productivo y limitar los pisos turisticos y regular etc pero esto ... es de subnormales ...\n\"Pero las tiendas de turron, que venden exclusivamente este dulce durante todo el año están apareciendo en lugares turísticos, y a menudo son vistos por los locales como un signo de gentrificación y un resultado del ‘turismo excesivo’.\"\nvale, ahora me siento culpable pq compré turrón en Málaga en una visita de fin de semana y no era Navidad\n[#6](c6#c-6) Yo soy amigo de una de las dependientas, de esa turronería de la que usted me habla. Las anécdotas y la incultura que se destila allí, son para escribir un libro.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Los medios británicos son los que siempre nos ponen a caldo de forma sistemática. Entre eso y que cualquier turista que te hable en inglés se considera británico y arreando...\nLos turistas británicos y de todos los colores. Este año Málaga recibirá 15 millones de turistas.\nImaginad lo que significa vivir aquí en Málaga o provincia con toda esa gente.\nTodo, absolutamente todo en exceso es malo. Y 80-85 millones de turistas en España es demasiado, porque no deja espacio a los lugareños.\nBueno, sí, pero no podemos pagar alquileres de 1000€ en Málaga en un barrio con sueldos que son cercanos a SMI.\nEl turismo masivo no destruye Málaga, lo destruye todo, y lo iguala todo.\nPasolini, ya lo anticipo en los 70. Se puede ver en su libro Escritos Corsarios, por ejemplo.\nHace falta más parque turístico estilo Benidorm, Salou o San Antonio que atraiga y concentre a los guiris para sacar el trabajo con menos impacto a las ciudades. Siempre pienso que si soltaran a los guiris que hay en un barrio de Benidorm por cualquier ciudad la joderían, sin embargo aquí concentrados no molestan y dejan el resto de barrios y pueblos cercanos en paz\n[#12](c12#c-12) Muy bien, pero no estamos en la España de los 60, cateta y rancia. Ahora la España del norte montañés le ha pasdo por la cara el modernismo al sur, que huele a tumbona, cerveza barata y guiri borracho.\nEl turista en Picos de Europa es un turista culto, sosesgado y va a tomar algo descansado tras patear el monte. El sur está lleno de los equivalentes a canis en Reino Unido.\nY al contrario que sur y levante, no metemos todos los huevos en la misma cesta.\n[#13](c13#c-13) ojalá le toque estar un mes de informador turístico con la fauna que llega al Cantábrico y su \"turismo cultural\". O de operador del 112 atendiendo esguinces en alta montaña día sí día también por gente infrapreparada. O poniéndoles copas cuando acaban su \"paseo por el monte\". O disfrutando de cómo desaparece todo terruño y caserío productivo para convertirse en 2a vivienda de repunante al que todo le molesta de la vida campestre.\nVamos al modelo malagueño, no se haga pajas mentales: ningún estudio de capacidad de absorción de impacto tolera las cifras que tenemos en Parques Nacionales y Naturales, ni viviendas turísticas ni 2as residencias ni ostias en vinagre, y aún así, seguimos yendo a FITUR a prostituirnos por más ruina y servicios sólo para el turista. Desde pandemia la saturación es insufrible para lugareños e incluso turistas habituales que se quejan de las \"hordas\" y colas.\n[#15](c15#c-15) Lo de los esguinces de alta montaña es impresionante la cantidad de guiris que suben en chancleta porque no les entra en el tarro que aunque sea españa, aquí hace frío igualmente en el monte! Y que nieva incluso! Los nacionales tiramos mas al quechua como mínimo (y yo no concibo ir al monte sin unas botas de monte buenas y ropa decente por si acaso) pero por lo menos vamos mas apañados aunque flipaos siempre los hay...\nTodavía me meo cuando estando en los glaciares de urbión subía una pareja de chavales de no mas de 20 años con deportiva plana adidas con menos agarre que una placa de hielo la riñonera cruzada por medio y sin mas ropa que un short y un top preguntando si se podía subir arriba... los mandé de vuelta porque si subían... subirían también los de rescate\n[#13](c13#c-13) hay un poco de comentario en tu estereotipo (por no llamarlo algo peor).\nNo se que agravios imaginarios tienes montados en tu cabeza pero en el Sur estamos un poco hartos de ser tratados como el culo de España y que encima algunos sigáis saliendo con chorradas como esta.",

    "text": "Insurance Company Sues Over 180 Health Care Providers for Fraud Under RICO\nThe case is purportedly one of the largest insurance fraud actions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act filed in New York.\nDecember 19, 2024 at 06:44 PM\n3 minute read\nAmerican Transit Insurance Co. is seeking to recover $450 million in compensatory damages from over 180 healthcare providers for allegedly submitting fraudulent insurance claims.\nThe case is purportedly one of the largest insurance fraud actions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act filed in New York.\nBut it drew fire from Steven Harfenist of Harfenist Kraut & Perlstein, who has represented at least 75 defendants in similar cases, said this could be a strategy to obtain settlements with providers and entities that cannot afford to participate in litigation.\nCounsel has not officially appeared for the defendant yet, but Harfenist said he is set to be involved in the case.\nThe plaintiffs filed the case in the Eastern District of New York, and are represented by Manning & Kass and Cadwalder, Wickersham & Taft.\n\"No-fault fraud is a huge problem in New York. American Transit filed a lawsuit as part of its statutory responsibility to fight such fraud,\" William J. Natbony, Counsel at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft said. \"The allegations in the complaint speak for themselves.”\nAmerican Transit Insurance insures taxis, livery cars and ride-share vehicles in New York City. According to the complaint, the defendants, Surgicore, LLC centers, management and doctors, were accused of submitting fraudulent claims by being improperly licensed, billing for medically unnecessary services, illegal kickbacks and charging bills in excess than what defendants can obtain under the Comprehensive Motor Vehicle Insurance Reparations Act, known as New York's no-fault law.\nHarfenist said cases like this have been in circulation since the late 90's, but \"nobody ever paid attention to them.\"\nThese lawsuits surfaced because insurance carriers would deny medical claims, often for lack of medical necessity, which \"developed a receivable, and the manner in which you can collect a receivable is either through litigation or arbitration.\"\n\"In these arbitrations, the insurance companies were not faring well,\" Harfenist said. \"Along came, to some degree, a group of some bad actors. In every industry, there is some fraud. What [the insurance companies] realized in bringing these recovery actions against these fraudulent actors is that they could use this as a claims avoidance tool.\"\nNow, many RICO claims have been filed against entities and individuals in the medical care field, but Harfenist claimed the majority of these cases should not be brought under RICO.\n\"The medical providers couldn't afford to fight, so these billion-dollar insurance companies brought the weight down on these medical providers. These cases would get resolved because the providers couldn't afford to litigate ... They've become a very effective tool in wiping out large swaths of receivables.\"\nIn this case and [many others](https://www.law.com/2024/10/16/a-rico-surge-is-underway-heres-how-the-allstate-push-might-play-out/), the defendants are smaller practices, which have become easy targets for quick resolutions, Harfenist said.\nAmerican Transit Insurance [reported in August](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/nyregion/american-transit-insurance-uber-lyft-nyc.html) in its Q2 statement that it was insolvent with over $700 million in losses. Harfenist argued this action \"looks like a Hail Mary\" for the company.\nThe complaint is filled with \"boilerplate\" arguments, Harfensit said.\n\"Basically, they're saying any doctor that ever performed any type of procedure at any of these surgery centers is involved in a conspiracy,\" he said.\nHarfenist said he hopes there will be regulatory change to deal with how insurance carriers respond to no-fault claims.\n\"I don't think it's gotten any real legislative interest in terms of reform to sort of balance out these cases,\" Harfenist said, \"because none of them really result in verdicts.\"\nRead the complaint:\nNOT FOR REPRINT\n© 2024 ALM Global, LLC, All Rights Reserved.
