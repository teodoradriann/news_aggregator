    "text": "Can Betta Fish Live with Gouramis? A Comprehensive Guide The short answer is a resounding NO . Housing betta fish ( Betta splendens ) and gouramis together is generally a recipe for disaster. While both are beautiful and popular freshwater fish, their temperaments and territorial behaviors clash, often leading to stress, injury, and even death.\nWhy Bettas and Gouramis Don’t Mix: A Clash of Personalities The incompatibility stems from a combination of factors:\nAggression: Both bettas and many gourami species, especially males, are known for their territorial and aggressive tendencies. They are both members of the Gourami family, which makes them naturally competitive with one another. They are likely to see each other as threats, sparking constant battles for dominance.\nSimilar Appearance: The flowing fins and vibrant colors that make bettas and gouramis so appealing to hobbyists are precisely what triggers aggression. They often mistake each other for rivals, intensifying their combative behavior.\nStress: Even if direct fighting is avoided, the mere presence of the other can cause chronic stress. This weakens their immune systems, making them more susceptible to disease.\nFin Nipping: Some gourami species are notorious fin nippers, and bettas , with their elaborate fins, are prime targets. Fin nipping leads to infection, stress, and a significantly shortened lifespan.\nTherefore, keeping these two species together is highly discouraged. The potential risks far outweigh any perceived benefits.\nAlternative Tank Mates for Bettas and Gouramis Instead of trying to force an incompatible pairing, focus on creating a peaceful and thriving environment for each fish with suitable tank mates.\nFor Bettas: Ideal companions for bettas include small, peaceful fish like neon tetras , harlequin rasboras , corydoras catfish , and snails . Avoid anything brightly colored or with flowing fins.\nFor Gouramis: Gouramis , depending on the species, can coexist with similar-sized, peaceful fish. Larger tetras , peaceful barbs , and danios are good options. Avoid fin nippers and overly active fish that might stress the gouramis .\nRemember to research the specific needs of each species before introducing them to your tank. Factors like tank size, water parameters, and temperament should all be taken into consideration.\nCreating a Peaceful Community Tank Regardless of the fish you choose, a well-planned and maintained aquarium is crucial for success.\nTank Size: Provide ample space for all inhabitants. Overcrowding leads to stress and aggression.\nHiding Places: Include plenty of plants, rocks, and decorations to provide refuge and break line of sight.\nWater Quality: Maintain pristine water quality through regular water changes and a reliable filtration system.\nFeeding: Offer a balanced diet and avoid overfeeding.\nObservation: Carefully observe your fish for signs of stress or aggression. Be prepared to separate individuals if necessary.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Can I keep a female betta with gouramis? Even female bettas , though generally less aggressive than males, can still be territorial and may clash with gouramis . It’s best to avoid the pairing.\nWhat happens if I put a betta and a gourami together? The likely outcome is aggression. Either the betta or the gourami will become dominant and harass the other, leading to stress, injury, and potentially death.\nAre there any gourami species that are compatible with bettas? No. Due to their shared lineage and similar behaviors, no gourami species can reliably be kept with bettas .\nHow big of a tank would I need to keep a betta and a gourami together? Even a large tank wouldn’t guarantee success. The inherent territoriality of both fish makes peaceful coexistence unlikely, regardless of tank size. It’s not recommended.\nCan I keep a betta with a peaceful gourami like a pearl gourami? While pearl gouramis are known for their relatively peaceful nature, they can still be perceived as a threat by a betta , especially a male. The risk of aggression remains too high. The pearl gourami is also one of the hardiest gourami species.\nWhat are the signs of aggression between bettas and gouramis? Signs of aggression include chasing, nipping, flaring, clamped fins, hiding, and a loss of appetite.\nIs it possible to introduce them slowly to minimize aggression? Slow introduction doesn’t eliminate the risk of conflict. Their inherent territoriality will eventually surface, leading to problems.\nWhat if I have a very docile betta? Even a docile betta can become stressed by the presence of a gourami , and stress weakens the immune system. It’s best to err on the side of caution.\nCan a betta kill a gourami, or vice versa? Yes, either fish is capable of inflicting serious injury or even death upon the other, especially in a confined space.\nWhat should I do if I accidentally put a betta and a gourami together? Separate them immediately. Place them in separate tanks or use a tank divider to create separate territories.\nAre there any exceptions to this rule? While individual fish personalities can vary, the general rule remains: bettas and gouramis should not be housed together. The risks are simply too great.\nWhere can I find more information about betta and gourami care? Numerous online resources and books offer detailed information about betta and gourami care. Look for reputable sources with accurate information.\nWhat are the ideal water parameters for bettas and gouramis? Bettas and gouramis generally prefer similar water parameters: a temperature of 76-82°F (24-28°C), a pH of 6.5-7.5, and soft to moderately hard water.\nHow important is tank decoration in minimizing aggression? Tank decoration plays a crucial role in minimizing aggression. Provide plenty of plants, rocks, and driftwood to create hiding places and break line of sight. This gives fish a sense of security and reduces the likelihood of conflict.\nWhat are some recommended tank mates for female bettas in a sorority? When keeping a sorority of female bettas , it is essential to provide a large and heavily planted tank to minimize aggression among themselves. Suitable tank mates include corydoras catfish , snails , and small, peaceful tetras or rasboras . Avoid any fish that are known fin nippers or that may compete with the bettas for resources. It is important to research and understand the environmental impacts of these types of pairings.

    "text": "The Department of Migrant Workers presented its achievements for the year 2023 on Friday during its Yearend News Conference held at Blas F. Ople bldg. DMW Officer-in-Charge Hans Leo Cacdac reported an increase in the deployment rate for the year 2023. About 608,000 sea-based workers were deployed compared to last year’s 554,000, while 491,000 land-based workers were deployed compared to last year’s 411,820. “The number of seafarers rose initially, reaching 608,000 compared to 554,000 overseas certificates distributed for the sea-based workers. For land-based workers, the figures increased to 491,000 from 411,820. The increase to 608,000 is particularly noteworthy as it marks the first time we’ve issued such a high number for the sea-based sector. It’s evident that 2023 was the year when global economies began to open up, along with world trade, marking our transition into a post-pandemic era. This shift signifies the opening of economies, job markets and global trade, with seafarers playing a pivotal role,” Cacdac said. Cacdac added that the DMW is anticipating an improved economic climate for 2024, opening more job opportunities for Filipinos. “We are anticipating an improved economic climate for 2024. This year, our expectations are higher for openings, especially as we focus on Saudi Arabia, where major development projects align with their vision for 2030. This aligns with our search for United Arab Emirates, which foresees economic development plans,” Cacdac added. Meanwhile, DMW Undersecretary for Policy and International Cooperation Patricia Yvonne Caunan said that the department has 38 pending Bilateral Labor Agreements and Memorandums of Understanding from 25 countries. “Currently, within the department, we have 38 pending Bilateral Labor Agreements and Memorandums of Understanding with 25 countries in our pipeline. Of these, 18 are from Europe and the Americas, 16 from the Middle East and Africa, and four the Asia and the Pacific,” “Beyond these 38 agreements in progress, negotiations are expected to be finalized in the near future. Not all may be scheduled for next year, but the countries are already in the pipeline and it is ongoing,” Caunan said. She added that the department successfully established the Japan Desk, safeguarding the welfare of the OFWs in Japan. “We have established our Japan Desk. Former Secretary Toots Ople initiated this during her visit to Japan with the President last February. The purpose behind this desk is not only to continuously safeguard the welfare of OFWs in Japan but also to ensure, in their own words, that we regain our position as the number one choice in Japan. Our efforts involve close collaboration with various stakeholders in Japan to achieve this goal,” “From our observations in the market, there is sustained demand for Filipino workers across the globe. This reinforces our ongoing efforts to collaborate with stakeholders and bridge gaps for the benefit of Filipino workers,” Caunan added. Meanwhile, DMW Undersecretary Bernard Olalia presented the department’s programs for promoting the welfare of OFWs in Saudi Arabia. “In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, labor reform initiatives were spearheaded by our former Secretary Toots Ople, aimed at bolstering worker protection and welfare. Undersecretary Caunan and I traveled to Saudi Arabia and established a framework to advocate for fair and ethical recruitment. This framework, known as the whitelisting framework, was put into place by us. In conjunction with the white list framework, we also developed a black list framework that welcomes the participation of employers, agencies, and local recruitment agencies who are qualified, competent, and committed to complying with our ethical guidelines,” “It is important to note that this is a collaborative effort between KSA and the Philippines. It has been recognized, and we are currently in the process of implementation, resulting in positive outcomes evident in the welfare statistics in KSA,” Olalia said.

    "title": "Philly may see fewer Canadian tourists in 2025 - WHYY",
    "text": "Have a question about Philly’s neighborhoods or the systems that shape them? PlanPhilly reporters want to hear from you! Ask us a question or send us a story idea you think we should cover.\nThe Philadelphia hotel industry posted solid gains last year and entered 2025 with strong momentum. But there’s major headwind expected among international travelers, who are more likely to stay longer than their domestic counterparts.\nOverall, Philadelphia had 26.6 million visitors in 2024 , with overnight visitors increasing 4% over the year. Visitors spent $4.5 billion in 2024, a new record.\nHotels in the city saw higher occupancy, room rates and revenue compared to 2023, according to the annual tourism report from Visit Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor\nPhiladelphia hotels generated $769 million in 2024, up from $724 million in 2023. Hotel revenue and room rates have steadily increased since record lows during the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago.\nThe average daily rate, or what hotels charge customers, hit $214 in 2024, down slightly from last year.\nWhile the revenue available per room — the average daily rate multiplied by the occupancy rate — was $143 per available room, compared to $135 in 2023.\nPhiladelphia hotel occupancy did improve from 63% in 2023 to 67% in 2024. But it has not outpaced pre-pandemic levels, in part, because the industry is bigger with more hotel rooms than in 2019, said Gregg Caren, president and CEO of the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau.\nHe said about five new hotels with about 2,000 more rooms were added in the past five years.\n“We have more rooms to sell, which is great during big events, whether it’s the World Cup or a big citywide convention,” Caren said.\nWe rounded up the coolest spots in Delaware, New Jersey, Philadelphia and the suburbs for food and drink, outdoor activities, attractions worth the cost and free things to do. In 2024, 1.2 million international tourists visited the city and spent about $679 million, up from $579 million in 2023.\nOn average, international travelers spent $572 per trip and visited for five days in 2024, while domestic travelers spent $167 and visited for two days.\nThat means it’s a big deal that 12% fewer international travelers are expected to visit Philadelphia this year, according to estimates by Tourism Economics shared by the visitors bureau.\nBy far, Canadians were most likely to visit the city, as 535,100 did last year, a 2% increase compared to 2023. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor\nAbout 22% fewer Canadians are expected to visit this year, due to geopolitical issues like Donald Trump’s trade war and changing immigration policies.\n“We need to navigate through these headwinds right now,” Caren said. “If Canadian business is down, we’ll hopefully pump [tourism] from other countries or from domestic leisure travelers or from more people coming here for conventions.”\nPhiladelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau brought 542,202 visitors to the city from conventions, meetings and sports. Those attendees spent about $410 million and generated an estimated economic impact of $636 million across the city.\nAs the city prepares to host many international visitors in 2026, it’s unclear whether the expected downturn in tourism may continue. Caren said he’s most focused on making sure that the rest of 2026 is fully booked with conventions and meetings to keep the flow of travelers steady all year.\nCapturing the attention and interest of travelers who visit Philadelphia at least once is key, he said.\nThat’s because about 79% of leisure travelers return to Philadelphia after one visit – about 27% higher than the national average, according to Longwoods International and Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau research.",
