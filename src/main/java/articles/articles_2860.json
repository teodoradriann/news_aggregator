    "text": "Dr. Alpaslan Özerdem, Dean of the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution and professor of peace and conflict studies, recently visited Mason Korea to engage with faculty and students in the Conflict Analysis and Resolution program.\nAs part of his visit, he delivered a lecture titled “Technology, Peacebuilding, and Future-Oriented Programs,” highlighting how digital transformation is reshaping peacebuilding and humanitarian aid, and emphasizing the need to empower youth as global changemakers through empathy, innovation, and cross-cultural collaboration.\nIn a follow-up conversation, he reflected on the recent Youth Trilateral Leadership (YTL) Workshop, which he oversaw in partnership with the U.S. Embassy and Mason Korea. “The YTL workshop is significant because it empowers youth as peacebuilders, connects them with the role of technology in peace efforts, and fosters cross-cultural understanding among young people from Japan, Korea, and the U.S.—especially important given the historical tensions in East Asia,” he said.\nDean Özerdem also shared plans to launch a Peace Tech Lab at Mason Korea. “As I explained in my talk, peace labs are for problem solving. I want to build peace labs in different countries, each focusing on different aspects of peace work,” he said. “I’ve had great discussions with Dean Park and Professor Wilson, and the Computer Game Design faculty here are also very interested. I want the lab here to explore how games can be used for teaching, problem solving, and peacebuilding.”\nHe concluded, “We’re going to work on this over the summer, and I hope that within the next academic year, we’ll have good news to share with the community.”\nDuring his visit, Dean Özerdem also took part in Mason Korea’s MOU signing ceremony with the Korean Association of Negotiation Studies (KANS). The agreement, signed by Mason Korea Dean Dr. Joshua Park, marks the beginning of a partnership to launch a new Advanced Negotiation Program and a commitment to collaborative research and academic exchange in conflict and negotiation studies.\nJune 11, 2025",

    "text": "Обратился клиент. В ходе камеральной проверки ему доначислили несколько миллионов рублей — налоговая посчитала, что НДС к вычету заявлен необоснованно.Что случилось?Компания вела обычную деятельность — закупала товар, перепродавала, работала официально. Всё белое, всё документально подтверждено. Но часть поставщиков — как оказалось позже — была признана «техническими».Что это значит? По мнению ФНС, эти фирмы:— не вели реальной деятельности (нет офиса, сотрудников, производственной базы)— не отчитывались или отчитывались формально— массово обналичивали средства— были зарегистрированы на подставных лицВывод инспекции: раз контрагент технический, значит, и НДС, заявленный к вычету, — «бумажный», к возмещению не подлежит. Всё просто. И — как им кажется — логично.Но так ли это?На практике налоговая пытается повесить на бизнес:1. Ответственность за поведение контрагента2. Обязанность по проверке его “деловой репутации”3. Риски, которые вы не можете контролироватьВо многих случаях у компаний действительно есть все документы: договоры, счета-фактуры, акты, платёжки. Сделки реальны, товар есть. Но этого недостаточно, если у поставщика нет ресурсов, и это нигде не зафиксировано.Важно не только собрать формальный пакет документов, но и подтверждать, что у контрагента были ресурсы для исполнения обязательств. Сюда входит: склад, транспорт, сотрудники, закупки, сайт, и так далее — любые следы реальности.Кому стоит насторожиться:— если ваши поставщики — микрокомпании с минимальными активами— если вы не знаете, кто у них директор, кто их обслуживает— если счета-фактуры — единственное, что у вас есть от сделкиЧто можно сделать:1. Вводите процедуру проверки новых контрагентов: хотя бы ИНН, адрес, учредители, судимость, массовость2. Храните документы. Не только те, которые по закону — любые, которые могут подтвердить, что сделка была реальной3. Фиксируйте реальность исполнения: кто привёз, кто принял, фото, подписи4. Используйте антикризисные оговорки в договорах: на случай спора и отзыва вычетовЕсли у вас уже спор по «бумажному» НДС или опасения, что может начаться — напишите.

    "title": "Arizona Coyotes, fans share emotional embrace in likely Arizona swan song",
    "text": "TEMPE — As the season – and 28 years of ice hockey in the desert – came to a close, Arizona Coyotes players removed their jerseys and tossed them to chosen fans. There was no rush to get off the ice because nobody wanted to leave. The players stayed to sign autographs and tossed merchandise over the glass, while spectators and team employees choked back tears. For upwards of 40 minutes postgame, the sold-out hometown crowd and the Coyotes shared one final moment in a season finale that brought on mixed emotions – from crying and cheers to hugs and shared memories throughout the concourse at Mullett Arena. Wednesday night marked the end of a long, up-and-down era for the Coyotes, who are relocating to Salt Lake City after nearly three decades in the Valley, similar to how the game played out in Arizona’s 5-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers. Before the first puck dropped, anxious energy filled the 5,000-seat arena, but after the opening face-off, anxiety and fear transformed into joy for the next 60 minutes. Fans waved white shirts from start to finish – not as a sign of surrendering despite the looming relocation but in the spirit of the tenacity shown through decades of instability. The atmosphere outside of the arena mimicked the intensity of fans inside. A watch party was held for fans who couldn’t view the game in person due to record-shattering ticket prices that rose to as much as $10,000 for seats in the cozy arena. “The Coyotes mean everything to me. I wouldn’t be the person I am today,” said longtime Coyotes fan Alex Khoury. “I wouldn’t have met the people that I love and cherish without them. I don’t know where I would be without the Coyotes. It is heartbreaking to see them leave.” Lawson Crouse interacting with the fans 40 minutes after the final horn [#yotes] [pic.twitter.com/RViNedR3wX] — Josh Jones (@jones_josh5) [April 18, 2024] “What’s not to like about the Valley?” Coyotes coach André Tourigny said after the organization’s final game in Arizona was in the books. “If there’s a paradise, it’s near here. I don’t know where it is, but it’s not far from here.” Amid speculation that owner Alex Meruelo will continue to pursue a new arena in the Phoenix area and seek an expansion team in the future, the Coyotes played their final game in the Valley. Lisa Parker, a die-hard Coyotes fan, holds a special place in her heart for the team. “When I was 13 years old I had open-heart surgery, and I got a Make-A-Wish grant and I was able to meet all of the players,” Parker said. “It was my wish because I had fallen in love with this team so it is going to be really hard to see them go.” The Coyotes fed off the emotion and channeled their own on the ice. Goals by forwards Liam O’Brien, Matias Maccelli and Lawson Crouse gave Arizona a 3-2 lead heading into the final minutes of the game. Forward Dylan Guenther buried a late fourth goal, followed by an empty-net goal from Sean Durzi to secure a meaningful 5-2 win in front of a sold-out crowd. As much as the team means to the fans, the community’s support was life-changing for players and their careers in Arizona. “I’ll be grateful forever that I got the opportunity to play my first game as a Coyote and got to play my first game in Arizona and play in front of the fans that I’ve cheered with, the people that have been so great to me and my family,” said Arizona forward Josh Doan, a Valley native and the son of Shane, the Coyotes’ franchise scoring leader. Liam O’Brien postgame [#Yotes] [pic.twitter.com/p6JBFnB7Np] — Josh Jones (@jones_josh5) [April 18, 2024] Despite the importance of securing a win in the Arizona farewell, Wednesday seemed less about a game and more about the loyalty, passion and grit of Coyotes fans. Resiliency shined in a celebratory and wholesome environment, while anger and sadness seeped through the cracks. “It was a mixed feeling, I am sure, for our fans in the sense that there’s a lot of pride for their team,” Tourigny said. “They support us and cheer for us and there was a lot of emotion, but at the same time there is a little bit of sadness on their side, and I really, really understand that.” “Let’s go Yotes!” and the classic tune “Sweet Caroline” was followed by tears and chants of “Salt Lake sucks!” Most of the bitterness from Coyotes fans comes from a long history of dysfunction and betrayal. Ownership plagued the team countless times during the team’s tenure in the Valley after it relocated from Winnipeg in 1996. From bankruptcy and being forced out of Glendale to a failed vote for a new arena in Tempe, the franchise never established a stable footing to prosper. Suboptimal arenas have housed the team since it arrived in 1996. A claustrophobic American West Arena hosted the Coyotes from 1996-2003 before the team played at Gila River Arena in Glendale until being removed by the city in 2021. “To know what they have gone through, all the ups and downs, and to see them here tonight after everything they’ve been through over the past 20 years is really incredible,” Doan said of the fans. Meurelo has lacked communication with the organization throughout the process of acquiring a sustainable arena in Arizona. Fans have expressed their loss of trust in the current ownership group. Despite the frustration, however, nothing remotely paralleled the specialty of the moment shared between the fans and the players following Wednesday night’s game. It felt like one giant hug. The Coyotes are expected to announce their relocation to Salt Lake City in the coming days. The team will travel to Utah soon to scout its new facilities. “It all came pretty fast, I was planning on leaving all of my clothes here, thinking I was going to come back and play another year in the desert,” Coyotes forward Logan Cooley said. “But obviously that’s not the way it went.”",

    "text": "Everything seemed to be coming together for Hickory High junior pitcher Matthew Lefevers during the first half of the 2023 baseball season. Then he felt a pop in his throwing arm. It was in the third inning of a game on April 5. “I knew it right then and there,” he said. The ulnar collateral ligament was torn in the pitching arm of Lefevers. He needed Tommy John surgery. After weeks of tests and doctor’s visits, he had the surgery in May. Lefevers built a solid high school baseball career before the injury. In the first half of the season, he had a 0.91 ERA with 37 strikeouts over 30.2 innings. He had a college scholarship offer on the table from Radford University and was close to committing. When he felt that pop, Lefevers said his first worry was that everything he had worked for was going to evaporate. People are also reading… Feeling the love The night of the injury, Lefevers was on a phone call with Radford’s pitching coach. What he heard eased his nerves and convinced him that Radford would be the place for him after all. “He said, ‘This doesn’t change how we feel about you at all,’” Lefevers said. “That’s what helped me make that decision to go to Radford because they didn’t give up on me.” Lefevers committed to Radford on April 12. He said he also had plenty of support from family, friends, teammates and his coach David Craft. He said that support was an important piece of what would become a nearly yearlong recovery. “There wasn’t a day that I felt alone,” Lefevers said. “That was a huge part of this process because that’s really what breaks people sometimes because they don’t have that support.” Baby steps After the surgery, Lefevers began his rehab at Architech Sports. He said the process was agonizingly slow at first. “At first, there’s really not much you can do,” he said. “You can’t really even walk because they do actually take part of your hamstring out.” He progressed slowly through the summer. It was more than four months before he picked up a baseball. The first few times he could barely throw it. “I was just throwing it enough to get it 10, 15 feet in front of me,” Lefevers said. But Lefevers kept working until he was able to throw the distance from the mound to home plate by the end of November. It had been nearly eight months since his injury. He said staying motivated through such a long, arduous process was difficult. “There’s the saying, ‘Trust the process,’” he said. “Faith was huge throughout this because I was having to believe in something I can’t see.” The process was especially difficult when results were hard to see. “I put my faith in God and he is going to put these things in the works for my good,” Lefevers said. “I don’t need to necessarily worry about the results because I know he is going to take care of those things.” Taking the mound Since Lefevers was already committed to Radford, he didn’t need to play during his senior year. Still, he was excited to get back to practice with the teammates who had supported him through his comeback. He was able to play in the games, but he wasn’t able to pitch at first. It wasn’t clear if he was going to be ready to pitch at all before the season ended. On April 19, 2024, a year and a few days after the injury, Lefevers took the mound against St. Stephens. He pitched in two games for Hickory. He said he’s happy with the progress he has made. I’m happy with where I’m at,” he said. “I feel like I’ve put in a lot of really good work, but I also know there’s a lot of good work that needs to be put in to get where I want to be.” Earning it the hard way Things likely would have gone better for the Red Tornadoes early in the season if a full-strength Matthew Lefevers had been able to take the mound. Hickory lost eight of their first 10 games before upsetting Fred T. Foard in the opening round of the Easter tournament. Lefevers said it was frustrating not to be able to help the team with its pitching struggles but he tried to keep a positive focus. “I just needed to remind myself that I’m so thankful to be able to play this sport because I understand what it’s like for it to be taken away in a heartbeat,” he said. By the end of the season, Hickory was moving in the right direction. The Red Tornadoes finished strong, winning five of the team’s last eight games. Lefevers said it was a satisfying experience to overcome a rough start and develop together into a better baseball team. “It was something that we hadn’t really been through, an early smack in the mouth and we have to respond,” he said. “It was a struggle day in day out … and to finish the season with everybody clicking on the same page, it was really satisfying.” Facing the future Next up for Lefevers is starting his college career at Radford later this summer. “I’m excited to live my lifelong dream of playing at the next level,” he said. He believes his experience coming back from the injury has helped him develop the perseverance that will help him in college. “I’ll have to earn everything I get there,” he said. “Nothing will be given to me.” Still, he said he’s more excited than nervous. “I’m excited to be able to prove myself,” Lefevers said. “Which is something I feel like I haven’t had that full opportunity to do yet.” Jason Koon is the Sports Editor for the Hickory Record and can be reached at [jason.koon@lee.net](mailto:jason.koon@lee.net).",

E così, papa Francesco, da settimane con la bronchite (che lui all'inizio aveva definito un semplice raffreddore) è stato costretto a un ricovero al Gemelli per accertamenti e, recita la nota della sala stampa vaticana, «per proseguire in ambiente ospedaliero le cure per la bronchite tutt’ora in corso».

E così acnhe nel corso delle ultime udienze il Papa, pur felice di poter stare in mezzo alla gente, era apparso affaticato e con una insistente tosse.\nSUo malgrado, dunque, dovrà rimandare la visita a Cinecittà, prevista per il prossimo lunedì mentre restano intatti gli altri appuntamenti del Giubileo degli artisti. In sua assenza è stata annullata la sola udienza generale di sabato 15 febbraio e l'iniziativa negli studios di Roma mentre gli altri eventi si svolgeranno come da programma.

    "text": "\"We are Committed to Providing the People of India with the Highest Quality of Service we can\"- Musk Elon Musk applauded the Indian government's choice to utilise an administrative process instead of an auction to distribute satellite broadband spectrum. Starlink, Musk's satellite internet startup, is expected to benefit from this action as it eliminates the need for competitive bidding to obtain spectrum in the nation. Jyotiraditya Scindia, India's Minister of Telecom, stated at a New Delhi event that the telecom regulator will decide pricing and that spectrum allocation will take place administratively. Scindia stressed that this strategy is in line with global norms, saying, \"If you do decide to auction it, then you will be doing something that is different from the rest of the world.\" The choice was made in the midst of discussion about how satellite spectrum should be distributed in India, which is essential for the launch of satellite-based internet services there. Musk stated on X (previously Twitter) that he will try his hardest to use Starlink to help the people of India. In addition, he observed that the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations agency responsible for satellite communications, has long designated this form of spectrum for shared use among satellite operators and that an auction for the spectrum would be unprecedented. Reliance Still Pushing for Auction Even if Musk's Starlink is in favour of administrative allocation, India's telecom behemoths are against the move. The billionaire Mukesh Ambani's company Reliance had previously contested the regulatory consultation procedure, claiming that an auction is required to guarantee fairness. They think satellite companies, particularly those hoping to service affluent urban areas, ought to buy spectrum just like regular telecom companies. The auction approach was also supported by Sunil Mittal, the chair of Bharti Airtel and co-chair of Eutelsat. Speaking at the event in New Delhi, Mittal stated that satellite businesses that want to enter the urban market should purchase spectrum in the same way that telecom companies do. The ITU's criteria for shared spectrum allocation for satellites are widely adhered to globally, thereby endorsing the position of Musk and other satellite operators. But domestic telecom giants like Airtel and Reliance are worried about keeping the playing field equitable. They contend that, given the rising demand for satellite internet services in cities, auctioning will bring justice and transparency to the distribution of spectrum. OneWeb, an Airtel-partnered subsidiary of Eutelsat, had also voiced requests in its representations to the Indian government earlier in 2023 regarding the auctioning of satellite spectrum. Global satellite providers, such as Starlink and Amazon's Project Kuiper, meanwhile, maintain their support for administrative distributions since they see spectrum as a common resource.

O treinamento muito parecido, igual ou até melhor do que o Guardiola”, opinou Mattos, em entrevista ao Charla Podcast.\nO CEO do Cruzeiro revelou o motivo de comparar o treinador ao técnico espanhol Pep Guardiola.\nSegundo o dirigente, em 2016, enquanto comandava o futebol do Palmeiras, ele viajou à Inglaterra para finalizar a venda de Gabriel Jesus ao Manchester City, equipe treinada por Guardiola. Essa experiência permitiu a Mattos uma análise mais próxima do trabalho do espanhol, levando-o a traçar paralelos entre os dois renomados treinadores\n“Eu fui lá (na Inglaterra) levar o Gabriel Jesus e vi uma semana de treino do Guardiola. Impressionante, o dele (Sampaoli)( é igualzinho. Ideias de jogo, muito diferente da maioria dos treinadores. Sempre tive assim, da linha do El Loco Bielsa, um cara muito distinto, fantástico tecnicamente” , completou.\nTroca de técnico no Cruzeiro Recentemente, no programa Jogo Aberto, o comandante também comentou sobre a possível troca de treinador no Cabuloso, após derrapadas de Fernando Seabra no comando do time. Assim, Mattos negou as negociações com o treinador do Grêmio, Renato Gaúcho.\nPUBLICIDADE PUBLICIDADE Alexandre Mattos assina renovação com Kaiki no Cruzeiro (Foto: Gustavo Aleixo/Cruzeiro)\nPUBLICIDADE PUBLICIDADE “Dez, quinze dias atrás, eu estava respondendo a mesma coisa sobre o Cuca.
