    "text": "Arcelia Ramírez interpreta a Sofía en la película “Lluvia”, dirigida por Rodrigo García Saiz. Esta es su ópera prima y presenta un retrato de la Ciudad de México a través de seis historias entrelazadas. Cada personaje enfrenta momentos de introspección y desafíos personales bajo una lluvia intermitente.\nEste momento fue propicio para tocar algunos temas de su vida personal, en especial de salud.\nRamírez, la talentosa actriz mexicana, recientemente compartió que ha pasado por problemas de salud complicados.\nAunque todo tuvo solución y fue una cirugía ambulatoria, la famosa dio relato del momento vivido:\n“Yo me estoy recuperando de una operación ambulatoria que ya está todo bien, ya me ven, pero fue complicado. Yo creo que es importante también estos procesos porque recuerdan que hay que cuidar el cuerpo, poner atención a lo que viene, alimentarse bien, hidratarse”, expresó.\nA pesar de estos problemas, la famosa ha continuado con su carrera y ha sido reconocida por su dedicación y talento en el cine y la televisión.\n“Proyectos que le hacen mucha ilusión, que se llama ‘Las Muertas’ de Jorge Ibarguengoitia, que dirige Luis Estrada; eso va a ser un estreno muy, muy poderoso”, agregó.\nTambién aprovechó la ocasión para contar que vuelve también al teatro.\nEl talento de Arcelia Ramírez brilla en el escenario del Foro La Gruta del Centro Cultural Helénico, donde protagoniza “Todos eran mis hijos” de Arthur Miller.\nBajo la dirección de Diego del Río, Arcelia ofrece una interpretación conmovedora de Kate Keller, una madre que se enfrenta a los desafíos de su familia en un contexto histórico marcado por la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\nLa obra, que se presenta del 13 de marzo al 13 de abril, es una muestra del poder del teatro para explorar las emociones humanas y generar reflexión en el público.",

    "title": "Indian Foreign Minister Seeks Stronger Ties With Japan; Countries Share Concern Over Territorial Moves by China - The Japan News",
    "text": "“Given the recent changes in Japanese defense and security policy, I see a lot of potential to enhance our security cooperation,” Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in a written interview, which was followed by an in-person interview on Friday with The Yomiuri Shimbun and The Japan News. As this year is the 10th anniversary of the upgrade of India-Japan relations to a “Special Strategic and Global Partnership” — initiated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — the foreign minister said, “I think it would be a right moment to add new content and new agenda to our partnership to make it contemporary.” The partnership already includes defense, security, trade, and people-to-people exchanges. “India and Japan have shared interest for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” Jaishankar said. India, whose population of 1.4 billion is the world’s largest, presents itself as a leading power among the emerging and developing countries known as the Global South. It seeks to amplify both its own influence and the collective voice of the Global South. Reflecting on India’s global responsibilities, the foreign minister said: “It is important that countries speak up on their behalf. India is trusted by many of them to do so. This is particularly in regard to debt, inflation, trade disruptions, climate justice, SDG [Sustainable Development Goals] progress, and food and health security.” China’s military build-up in the South China Sea and East China Sea indicates that Beijing is attempting to unilaterally change the status quo in the Indo-Pacific region. India accuses China of attempting to change the status quo along its borders in the Himalayan region as well. “India believes in the observance of international law and respect for agreements concluded between nations,” the foreign minister said, adding that “peace and tranquility in our border areas with China has been disturbed because China has not observed relevant agreements. Our endeavor is to resolve the resulting situation through direct discussions, which are in fact under way.” In the in-person interview, Jaishankar explained that bilateral efforts, including several meetings of military commanders, have been made since the two countries’ militaries clashed on the border in 2020. The minister said there has been “some progress, and some significant progress, but [there are] still some issues to be done.” With regard to the Quad, a security cooperation framework among Japan, the United States, Australia and India, viewed in some quarters as effectively keeping China’s growing military influence in the Indo-Pacific region in check, the minister said that maritime and cybersecurity and counterterrorism have emerged as important agenda items. In writing, he stressed that “India will reinforce these focus areas as we consolidate and strengthen Quad cooperation.” Meanwhile, even amid Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, India has been buying more crude oil from Russia. Asked if India’s importing of crude oil is supporting Russia economically, the minister said: “India is actually stabilizing the global energy markets at a time when they are affected by the Ukraine conflict. Our imports have helped to manage global prices and reduce global inflation. This should be appreciated.” As for India’s relationship with Russia, he said: “Both nations value the relationship and take care that we never harm each other’s interests. For many years, we have endeavored to broaden the economic relationship to reflect our natural complementarity … Some of these trends should be seen for their own value rather than be linked to the ongoing conflict.” Asked about India’s stance on bringing Russian aggression in Ukraine to an end, the foreign minister said: “India is ready to contribute to any effort towards dialogue and peace. We remain in regular contact with both Russia and Ukraine.” In the in-person interview, he referred to several occasions when India mediated between Russia and Ukraine and said: “We all want to … bring this to an end, but we cannot bring it to an end. It has to be dealt with by the countries concerned. But if we can be of any help in any way, I think we are always open.”",

    "text": "炒股就看 金麒麟分析师研报 ，权威，专业，及时，全面，助您挖掘潜力主题机会！\n　　■ 张 敏\n　　渐冻症患者在脑海中默念“我想和家人散步”，大屏幕上会实时解码、浮现出清晰的汉字；瘫痪患者通过意念操控机械臂完成比心动作；癫痫患者可通过意念玩游戏……脑机接口技术正以前所未有的速度突破科幻边界。\n　　临床试验阶段取得的进展，激发了资本市场对脑机接口的热情。 同花顺 数据显示，今年以来，截至4月23日，A股脑机接口概念指数累计涨幅超45%。近日，多家上市公司在投资者互动平台、业绩说明会上透露了各自有关脑机接口的发展规划、布局及进展等。\n　　值得思考的是，如今相关研发成果，是否意味着脑机接口已迎来产业化曙光？在笔者看来，脑机接口真正从临床试验走向商业化，仍要经历漫长过程，至少还需跨过四道门槛。\n　　其一是技术门槛。脑机接口的终极目标是实现人脑与机器的无缝融合，通过植入微型传感器精准读取神经信号，集成微型芯片完成信号处理与无线传输，最终达成思维与设备的双向实时交互。然而，排异反应、信号精度、长期安全有效性等难题，导致脑机接口技术商业化落地仍存在挑战。\n　　其二是人才门槛。脑机接口处于集成电路、生物制药与人工智能的交叉点，涉及微电子、神经科学、材料学、 机器人 、临床医学等多个学科，需要“神经科学家+材料工程师+算法专家”的复合人才及团队。目前，国内高校鲜有对口专业，现有从业者多从单一学科转型，导致“跨界语言”不通。笔者建议，未来要构筑高质量脑机接口专业教育体系，加强创新人才选拔培养，为脑机接口产业输送复合型人才。\n　　其三是产业整合门槛。目前，我国脑机接口产业中大多数企业仍处于发展初期，规模较小且主要围绕产业关键环节进行技术攻关，布局分散、缺乏系统性。由此，加强资源的调配整合、协同合作，形成自主可控的脑机接口产业链，势在必行。\n　　其四是资本支持门槛。脑机接口的发展离不开大体量资金的支持。神经信号的解码精度提升，背后可能是数万个小时的算法训练；电极材料的生物相容性优化，可能需要数百次动物实验，而后续开展临床试验更需要大体量资金支持。\n　　今年2月份，植入式脑机接口领域的企业阶梯医疗宣布完成3.5亿元大额B轮融资，创下国内该领域单笔融资最高纪录。不过，笔者也了解到，部分脑机接口企业仍面临着融资挑战，这缘于资本普遍担忧脑机接口的商业化前景。而换一个角度来看，培育壮大耐心资本，将十分有利于包括脑机接口在内的科技创新实现进一步突破。\n　　笔者认为，脑机接口大规模产业化的时刻终将到来，不过，这一征程中，各界需要群策群力，完善标准体系、打破学科藩篱，聚力攻克科技难题。唯有如此，美好的未来——瘫痪者行走、失语者“说话”、盲人“复明”，才能变为现实。\n新浪声明：此消息系转载自新浪合作媒体，新浪网登载此文出于传递更多信息之目的，并不意味着赞同其观点或证实其描述。文章内容仅供参考，不构成投资建议。投资者据此操作，风险自担。",

    "text": "Agastya Nanda recalls turning towards religion after going through ‘bad phase of anxiety’ during The Archies Recently, Agastya Nanda talked about his views on meditation and shared turning towards religion and spirituality after going through anxiety during his debut film The Archies. Megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s granddaughter Navya Naveli Nanda’s podcast show, What The Hell Navya has returned with its second season. The show with her grandmother, Jaya Bachchan and mother Shweta Bachchan gives peek into several interesting revelations. This time, the latest episode also featured Navya’s brother [Agastya Nanda](https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/agastya-nanda) who debuted in Bollywood last year. In the latest episode, Agastya opened up about turning towards religion after going through the ‘bad phase of anxiety’ during his debut film, The Archies. Agastya Nanda on men discussing mental health and doing meditation In the latest episode of What The Hell Navya Season 2, [Navya Naveli Nanda](https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/navya-naveli-nanda) asked if men are open to discussing their mental health these days. In response to which, Agastya Nanda opined that it’s a ‘very personal thing’ as one can look ‘absolutely fine’ while going through a lot of issues. [Jaya Bachchan](https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/jaya-bachchan) expressed her belief in not just men but how in today’s world everyone is open to talk about it. She stated that she actually gets to hear more people talking about depression as ‘there is too much to deal with physically, mentally, there’s too much available, and there’s too much to choose from.’ Shedding light on the same, Agastya talked about his own experience when he went through a rough patch. “I was a really anxious person. I am saying was because I went through a really bad phase of it. Like I used to feel a lot of anxiety,” he said. Navya Naveli Nanda revealed that Agastya meditates a lot and shedding light on the same, [The Archies ](https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/the-archies)actor shared that according to him when one is living in the world where a lot is happening, one retorts to the thing that ‘just grounds you’. He further instated his outlook that people in their generation are more anxious owing to being habitual of getting things instantly. “We’ve lost patience and we’ve lost faith. We’ve lost faith that things will work out, or things will be okay, because we’re so used to things being certain now,” he said and his sister also agreed to him. Agastya Nanda recalls going through anxiety during The Archies Agastya further shared the times during his debut film, The Archies when he became ‘very religious and spiritual’ and it came very ‘naturally’ to him. He believes that it gives one something to believe in that’s beyond their control. He further shed light on the anxiety he went through during his debut film, The Archies and how turning towards religion helped him. He said, “When I started acting, doing my first film, I was like, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do, if I’m going to do well, if people are going to like me, if they’ll think I’m bad’. There are so many things. I did my best, and I was like, ‘God, I leave it up to you’. I have to keep faith in something beyond me. Whoever you believe in, whether it’s God, or energy, manifestations, you believe in your mother, sister, if you just pass on that burden, it relieves you.” He further said that nonetheless, in today’s time when there are so many things that can cause anxiety or ‘exhaust’, there are platforms where one can go and seek help. Agastya Nanda stepped into Bollywood with [ Zoya Akhtar](https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/zoya-akhtar)’s The Archies that also marked the acting debut of Sridevi-Boney Kapoor’s daughter Khushi Kapoor, [Shah Rukh Khan](https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/shah-rukh-khan)’s daughter, Suhana Khan, Vedang Raina, Mihira Ahuja and others. The star-kid is currently gearing up for his next with Sriram Raghavan titled, [Ekkis](https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/ekkis).

    "title": "Were the SF Giants the team who gave Yoshinobu Yamamoto a javelin?",
    "text": "It surely could not have been\na pleasant holiday weekend for any San Francisco Giants fans who have Dodgers fans in the family. Not after both Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the top two free agents this offseason whom the Giants pursued heavily, landed with their hated archrivals in Los Angeles this month.\nBut in case the sting of those moves was starting to wear off a bit after Christmas, Wednesday gave Giants fans some fresh wounds to lick, courtesy of Yamamoto’s agent Joel Wolfe.\nAt the Dodgers’ introductory press conference for Yamamoto, Wolfe told the media\nhow close the Giants really came to signing his client.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“He thought that San Francisco really reminded him of Osaka and thought it was a beautiful city,” Wolfe\ntold reporters in Los Angeles of Yamamoto, the former star of the Osaka, Japan-based Orix Buffaloes.\n“If the Dodgers had not been pursuing him, there was a good chance San Francisco could have been his destination,” Wolfe added.\nWolfe also said that one of the clubs courting Yamamoto presented him with a “\nteam-issued javelin” as a gift, one of several he was reportedly given. On the surface, it’s a delightfully weird move. But Yamamoto has used a toy javelin in a warmup routine before, so this mystery team surely was hoping for the gift to be a sign of their depth of interest in Yamamoto.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nCould the Giants have been this mystery javelin gift-giving team? It’s hard to say yes with any certainty, but they do have a strong javelin connection in their history: Former Giants manager Felipe Alou was\na renowned javelin thrower in the Dominican Republic before he signed with the Giants in 1955. Alou is still a part of the organization as a special assistant to baseball operations… if you’re willing to galaxy-brain things, you can make it work.\nBut gift or not, it sure seems like the Giants never truly had\na shot at Yamamoto, the right-hander who has drawn comparisons to Tim Lincecum. On Wednesday, Yamamoto said the Dodgers signing Ohtani was not the top reason he signed with Los Angeles.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“I wouldn’t say [Ohtani] was the sole reason in deciding to come here, and if he went somewhere else, I probably would have still ended up in LA,” Yamamoto\nsaid through his interpreter on Wednesday. “Winning now and winning into the future was probably the most important thing in making this decision.”\nThe Athletic’s Giants beat reporter Andrew Baggarly had\nmade it clear just how strongly the Giants and president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi were pursuing Yamamoto. “There’s no numbing the pain if they fall short in the Yamamoto pursuit,” Baggarly wrote on Dec. 20. “According to those familiar with Zaidi’s thinking, he has never been so all-in on a free agent in his six years while leading the Giants’ baseball operations group.”\nThe excuses could be plentiful as to why the Giants keep falling short in their pursuits of the top free agents:\nthe ballpark, the city of San Francisco itself, their ownership. Zaidi hasn’t spoken to the media since Yamamoto’s decision became public Friday, so it’s unclear where the Giants’ final offer ended up compared to the 12-year, $325 million deal Yamamoto signed with the Dodgers (who will also pay a posting fee of more than $50 million to his former team).\nBut truly, no matter how heigh the Giants’ interest was, they\naren’t competing with their eternal rivals right now on the field — and that’s leading to them losing in these big moves off the field, too.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n—\nJung-hoo Lee is already helping the Giants. Now, the Giants need to help him.\n—\nMitch Haniger, Alex Cobb among Giants who will reportedly earn more than Shohei Ohtani in 2024\n—\nThe unlikely location of Duane Kuiper's last homer in an SF Giants uniform? Prison.\n—\nSF Giants owner Greg Johnson's 'somewhat break even' quote is enraging for fans",

    "text": "Thursday, April 4th 2024, 6:17 pm It's been a year since the launch of the Alternate Response Team One vehicle. Those behind the service say since then, it has helped hundreds of people. Commonly known as ART-1, the vehicle is used by the Tulsa Fire Department and Family and Children Services to respond to those having a mental health crisis. ART-1 made just under 100 calls in its first year, freeing up police, other firefighters and EMSA to respond to other calls. The vehicle is staffed with a crisis intervention trained Tulsa Fire Department paramedic, along with a clinician from Family and Children Services. Tulsa Fire Director of Emergency Medical Services Justin Lemery said even though ART-1 provides a medical evaluation, social assessment and connecting individuals to more services, the care doesn't stop there. \"We respond just like your traditional response or your 9-1-1 call, but there's also a continuum of care, so they're going to follow back up with that individual who was in crisis that day and make sure that they're receiving and connecting to the right resources in the community to get the help they need,\" Lemery said. Lemery said the Tulsa Fire Department is looking for ways to expand the services to cover more of the city and build on what alternate response team one has done this year.
