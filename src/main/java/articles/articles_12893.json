    "text": "Driver positive for THC, cocaine found guilty in Collier County head-on DUI crash Jason Mario Orlando was found guilty of driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injury after a three-day trial in Collier County that ended Thursday. On Jan. 7, 2021, around 6:30 a.m., Orlando was driving north on County Road 850 when he veered into the southbound lane. His car crashed head-on with another vehicle and then hit a third car, causing a three-car crash. The driver of the second vehicle checked on Orlando, who was slumped against the steering wheel. Orlando asked for help to get away, admitting he was drunk. Florida Highway Patrol responded to the scene and found open beer cans in Orlando's car, including one between the driver’s door and seat, several behind the driver’s seat, and others on the front passenger floorboard. The driver of the first car suffered significant injuries and identified Orlando as the driver who hit them. Orlando's blood alcohol level was 0.195, and he also had THC and cocaine in his system. Everyone involved in the crash was taken to the hospital. A trooper interviewed Orlando at the hospital and noted the smell of alcohol. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 9, 2024.",

New Delhi [India], March 9 : Stating that India's policy was 'Nation First' and the consumer was 'paramount', Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said that the Centre was able to keep oil prices from shooting up despite global turbulence amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict and drone attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea. The Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas said 85 per cent of India's crude requirements are met by imports, with the price of crude in the international market being the benchmark. Addressing a press conference in the national capital on Saturday, Puri said, \"If you accept that (global issues), you have to deal with the price of crude in the international market and the price at which it is made available. What happened in the last few years?\" The Union Minister elaborated on how the 'Russia-Ukraine war' impacted the crude oil supply, but India was able to manage its supply by diversifying its source and increasing the purchase from Russia despite fear of sanctions. \"We know how the Russia-Ukraine war erupted. Russia produces 11-13 million barrels per day. One way was to stop buying crude oil from Russia, but it would have brought down the availability and we couldn't have disrupted oil supply to the public. In that case, the prices would have shot up to USD 138...there were talks of sanctions,\" Puri said. \"At that stage, we were buying only 0.2 per cent crude oil from Russia. But, we had to confront and navigate the situation. We have been diversifying our supply and increased our purchases from Russia. Our policy is that from wherever we will get the crude oil as per our requirements, we will buy it, and it is a totally transparent system. When other countries saw this, they also gave us discounts. Our policy is 'nation first' and the consumer is paramount.\" Puri said that even though OPEC+ a bloc of 23 oil-exporting countries including OPEC reduced its crude oil production, oil prices didn't rise in India. \"Even the producing countries are taking steps to curtail production. OPEC+ reduced its production by 5 million barrels. Despite things standing as thus, the prices (in India) didn't go up, which means the market absorbed it,\" he said. The Union Minister also described how the Red Sea crisis impacts global oil supply while affirming that India will be able to navigate the situation while maintaining availability, affordability and sustainability. \"Due to the situation in the Red Sea, we have to track all the updates. Even though we are not directly concerned with shipping costs, our suppliers are. In spite of all that, I am very confident that the situation as it is and as it is likely to evolve has a lot of space to navigate in the interest of our consumers to ensure availability, which has not been affected at all in the last few years, affordability, which you have seen the evidence of and transition to green fuels, and sustainability,\" Puri added.

    "text": "North India is witnessing a significant drop in temperatures, marking the onset of winter and bringing with it a dense layer of fog that has severely impacted train services. On Friday, visibility was significantly reduced in several regions which caused delays for at least 24 trains departing from Delhi owing to the weather-related conditions.\nAmong the affected trains, the Ayodhya Express is delayed by 4 hours, while the Gorakh Express is running 2 hours and 50 minutes late. The Bihar Kranti Express is delayed by 3 hours and 20 minutes, and the Shram Shakti Express by 3 hours and 10 minutes.\nCheck full list of affected trains:\nTrain, flight services affected\nWith winter weather causing significant disruptions in northern India, both train and flight services are experiencing delays and operational challenges. Dense fog and low visibility, common during this season, have severely impacted travel schedules. Several airlines have issued travel advisories for passengers, urging them to check flight statuses before heading to the airport. Airlines are also providing updates through SMS and email notifications to ensure passengers remain informed about any changes.\n'Orange Alert' for Delhi-NCR\nMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an \"Orange Alert\" for fog in Delhi-NCR, warning of extremely low visibility. Several areas have reported zero visibility which has made travel challenging.
