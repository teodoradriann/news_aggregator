    "text": "Fireball meteors are forecast to light up the UAE's skies this week in the first celestial display of 2024.\nStargazers are being urged not to miss out on the chance to catch the Quadrantids meteor shows, which are expected to be at peak visibility on Thursday evening and Friday morning.\nAs many as 200 meteors can be seen an hour in ideal conditions. Visibility depends on weather.\nQuadrantids are renowned for their bright fireball meteors, which are large explosions of light and colour.\nDubai Astronomy Group will host a viewing of the event at Al Qudra Desert from 11pm on Thursday.\nRead More The dazzling celestial events set to light up UAE skies in 2024 The gathering is expected to last until 4am on Friday.\n“The Quadrantids typically display activity from late December to the second week of January, with the peak occurring on January 4-5 in Dubai this year,” Dubai Astronomy Group said on its website.\n“Unlike other meteor shows that enjoy a more extended peak period, the Quadrantids peak for just a short burst of a few hours.”\nThe group said that the position of the Moon could interfere with this year's meteor shower.\n“This year, the Moon’s presence may impact the meteors’ clarity, making them less distinct compared to a moonless night. It won’t be as crystal clear as on a moonless night, so we’re presenting this as a casual stargazing event with the possibility of catching a glimpse of meteors.”\nTickets for the event cost between Dh80 and Dh140. Details can be found on the group's website.\nIn December, about 500 people gathered in Al Qudra desert to witness the Geminids meteor shower at an event staged by the group.\nDespite cloudy conditions being forecast , clear weather helped stargazers see the bright meteors that moved at speeds of 125,528kph.\nUAE star gazers – in pictures\nGeminids meteor About 500 people gathered at the Al Qudra desert to observe the Geminids meteor shower.

    "text": "Reacting to the 2024 Global Climate highlights report by the WMO, Copernicus, Met Office, NASA, and other global climate monitoring organizations showing new climate extremes reached in 2024.[1] The report concludes that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with a new record high for daily global average temperature, plummeting ice sheet extent around Antarctica and the Arctic and rising carbon dioxide and methane levels, leading the world to cross the 1.5°C threshold for a full calendar year:\nIan Duff, Head of Greenpeace International's [Stop Drilling Start Paying](https://act-int.greenpeace.org/end-fossil-fuels) campaign said:\n\"Scientists are now putting numbers on what most of us already knew was a hell of a year, literally. From ongoing wildfires in California, to earlier disasters in India, Romania, Italy, Brazil and South Africa, homes were flooded, crops failed, and billions of people suffered from heat stress and breathed in toxic air. It's also been another year of ridiculous profits for the dirty oil and gas corporations fueling this crisis.\"\n\"Oil and gas corporations like Chevron, Exxon, Shell, or TotalEnergies cannot be trusted to voluntarily shift to clean and affordable renewable energy. In 2025 we demand governments to listen to the people and make polluters pay. Promises must turn into robust policies that will make polluting companies phase out fossil fuels and finance the loss and damage they cause.\"\nIn February 2025, Big Oil will announce another year of profits. At the same time, much of humanity is still reeling from record [heatwaves](https://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/press/16737/new-report-by-greenpeace-india-and-national-hawkers-federation-reveals-harsh-heatwave-toll-on-street-vendors/#:~:text=Health%20Risks%3A%2073.44%25%20of%20street,a%20decline%20in%20customer%20numbers), [drought](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=918992873595358&id=100064539620526&set=a.620265846801397), unprecedented [typhoon](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/71814/new-study-shows-typhoon-season-made-worse-by-climate-change-greenpeace-philippines-responds/) and [hurricane](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/monster-hurricane-supercharged-by-fossil-fuel-pollution-big-oil-must-be-held-accountable/) seasons, and [floods](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/69752/storm-boris-claims-heavy-losses-across-europe-greenpeace-calls-for-climate-polluters-to-pay/), all made worse by the climate crisis. Last year, Greenpeace International and Stamp Out Poverty published an [analysis](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/71322/tax-big-oil-grow-un-climate-loss-damage-fund-2000-analysis/) that shows that even a small tax on just seven of the world's biggest oil and gas companies could support communities and households worldwide in meeting the costs of the climate crisis.\nJohn Noel, Senior Climate Campaigner at Greenpeace USA said:\n\"This grim milestone didn't occur in isolation. It's the result of deliberate obstruction by fossil fuel executives, their political allies, and the corporate elite they serve-blocking us from tackling the crisis at the scale it demands. We must dismantle the dangerous corporate delusion that fossil fuel expansion can continue without consequence. Instead, we must embrace the once in a lifetime opportunity to build the zero-carbon infrastructure needed for a safe future that includes everyone.\"\nPhilip Evans, Campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said:\n\"This grim report confirms what last year's unprecedented storms, floods and wildfires made obvious: world leaders are failing to take the action needed to tackle the climate crisis. While millions around the world – including here in the UK, have faced displacement and devastation by extreme weather, the fossil fuel giants driving the crisis have continued banking billions while derailing global climate talks and obstructing change.\n\"As the world's most powerful climate denier returns to the White House, others must take up the mantle of global climate leadership. The majority of Brits want our leaders to stand up to the oil bosses and force them to stop drilling and start paying for the damage they are causing to our planet and everyone living on it.\"\n[here](https://www.miragenews.com/greenpeace-2023-hottest-year-surpasses-1-5c-1388955/).",

    "text": "Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has cast doubt on the need for a mid-cycle console upgrade due to the advancements in technology.\nSpeaking with Rolling Stone, Spencer was asked if Microsoft has any similar plans to Sony’s own mid-cycle refresh, the recently-launched\nPS5 Pro, but suggested it’s hard to show the benefits these days as consoles are far more technologically capable than the transition from standard to high-definition.\nDoes a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way? [It’s] less like the old days, going from the original Xbox to 360; that was standard definition to high definition. Now, [it’s] harder to show the benefits.\nRelated Content — Upcoming PS5 Games 2024: The Best PS5 Games Coming Soon\nMicrosoft has released a mid-cycle upgrade in the past during the Xbox One era, with the Xbox One X offering a more power under the hood similar to what Sony did during the same generation via PS4 Pro. The company has Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S available on the market for the current cycle, with the former the more powerful version of the system.\nThe PS5 Pro was released on November 7, 2024 priced at $699.99/£699.99.
