    "text": "Read full article The Guardian Trans woman falsely linked to DC plane crash sues influencer for defamation Rachel Leingang April 10, 2025 at 12:23 a.m. · 3 min read\nLink Copied\nJo Ellis was wrongfully accused of flying the helicopter that crashed with a plane over the Potomac River earlier this year. Photograph: Carlos Bernate/The Guardian A transgender woman who was erroneously identified as a helicopter pilot involved in the Washington DC crash that killed 67 people has filed a lawsuit against one of the conservative influencers who spread the false claims about her.\nJo Ellis, whom the Guardian wrote about after she was thrust into the spotlight, is suing Matthew Wallace, the person behind the X account, for defamation, claiming Wallace “concocted a destructive and irresponsible defamation campaign” that monetized a “false narrative” about her.\nEllis is represented by the Equality Legal Action Fund. The suit was filed in federal court in Colorado, where Wallace is believed to live.\nThe 29 January crash – where a helicopter hit a commercial airplane – led to a swarm of claims that diversity was to blame. Ellis, who was not involved in the crash in any way, is a Black Hawk pilot with the Virginia national guard. To dispel the rumors, she posted a video showing she was alive, effectively refuting the claims because all involved in the crash had died.\nADVERTISEMENT Related: ‘Frozen in time’: figure skating world unites in grief and tribute at Boston world championships\nAt the time, her name was trending on X. Wallace’s posts to his more than 2 million followers about Ellis, naming her as the pilot and in some cases including her photo, received millions of views, the suit notes. It doesn’t appear Wallace started the rumor, but he amplified it considerably.\nMeg Phelan, Ellis’s attorney, said Wallace is believed to be the first person to share Ellis’s likeness, though tracking social media posts has been difficult because many were subsequently deleted.\n“He was one of the largest platforms with the most followers to really publicize this and put it out there, and so that it went viral. It seemed very strategic, so that was really why we zeroed in on Matt Wallace,” Phelan said.\nAs a result, Ellis has received threats, including “credible death threats”, and hateful messages, many of which are transphobic, the suit claims. “Gaining infamy overnight caused Plaintiff and her family tremendous suffering,” the lawsuit says. “Plaintiff was devastated that her story was overshadowing the tragic events of the plane crash and likely causing more suffering for the families who lost their loved ones. She also feared for her safety and for the safety of her family.”\nADVERTISEMENT Ellis told the Guardian that her life “was turned upside down and forever changed” by the threats.\n“Too many times do people who have big platforms get to do this to innocent people and drag them through the mud and get away with it,” Ellis said. “And I have a unique opportunity to actually hold someone accountable. So I feel strongly about free speech, but I also feel strongly about consequences to free speech when you use it to stir up a mob and impact someone’s life.”\nWallace issued tweets to “correct” the false information after Ellis posted her proof-of-life video, but the lawsuit categorizes them as “making excuses for creating viral lies”.\nEllis was previously a private citizen, but was “forced into the public sphere and can no longer remain a private citizen” because of Wallace, the suit claims.\nShe still serves in the Virginia national guard and her increased public profile creates safety concerns for herself and her family.\nADVERTISEMENT “Sadly, my life is just different entirely, because when I move through life now, I’m recognized,” Ellis said. “I’m not too far from DC, so if I go up there, people recognize me, and I kind of have to look over my shoulder because of the anti-trans rhetoric. I don’t know if I’m going to be recognized by someone who’s friendly or someone who doesn’t like the fact that I’m in the military and I’m trans.”\nEllis said she would donate any monetary damages she could receive in the case to the families of the crash victims.",

    "title": "10 years of trees: Spruce Up Austin celebrates anniversary of Tree Trek",
    "text": "By Eric Johnson ,\n47 minutes ago In 2014, Spruce Up Austin established the Tree Trek running along the eastern edge of East Side Lake. Ten years later, the group celebrated the milestone of a decade with the planting of crimson spire oak.\nNow called the Mike Ruzek Tree Trek in honor of the man who has dedicated so much time to the planting of trees in Austin, there are 100 trees as part of the Tree Trek and acts as an educational tour for those visiting the trek.\n“I think this is going to be a wonderful asset to the community,” Ruzek said Thursday after a brief ceremony. “I’ve learned more about trees in the last 10 years than I did in the first 25 years.”\nThe initial establishment of the Tree Trek, part of a program through the University of Minnesota Community Forestry Program, was completed in honor of Spruce Up Austin’s 25th anniversary in September of 2014.\nOne of several Tree Treks in the state of Minnesota, Austin represents the largest and takes visitors on a tour of the trees, each with its own tag and QR code, which are being updated by master gardener Don Smith.\nAt each tree of the trek people can learn more about the tree planted there with the hope that maybe some of those people may take ideas away from this and plant their own.\n“It’s a resource for the community,” said current SUA President Caitlin Olson who added that a program also exists for people to establish memorials through the program. “It’s just beauty. We are a Tree City. We have to embrace that. It’s our identity.”\nAt the same time, Ruzek credited the work of the University of Minnesota program that helped establish the Tree Trek as well as those that have volunteered time and resources.\n“The University of Minnesota Community Forestry Program has been a vital part of this,” he said. “And our donors. It’s a complement to the work we had done previously in the 25 years before.”\nThe initial planting of trees included 40 varieties, but has since blossomed. At the time of taht first planting, SUA had planted over 2,600 trees over the first 25 years of the organization, a number that continues to grow to this day.\n“There’s always room to grow and expand,” Olson said. “But we have to maintain what we have. Let the trees grow.”\n“We can develop as we see fit in the future, however, people see it in the future,” Olson continued, adding that she even envisions a garden-like area as a possible addition somewhere down the line.\nIn the near future, however, SUA will continue work on the Tree Trek, updating its brochure and renumbering the trees in the current layout.\nFor more information on Tree Trek and the activities of Spruce Up Austin, visit: https://www.spruceupaustin.org/\nThe post 10 years of trees: Spruce Up Austin celebrates anniversary of Tree Trek appeared first on Austin Daily Herald .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7.\nGlobal Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities.\nThe Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month.\nAs Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed.\nHere's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada:\nJudih Weinstein Haggai\nJudih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says.\nShe told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there.\nLast week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza.\nWeinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships.\nWeinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nHer brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims.\n\"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\"\nVivian Silver\nVivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel.\n\"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club.\nHe said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming.\nZeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza.\nOn Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver.\nHe said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974.\nShe dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added.\nShe also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel.\nTiferet Lapidot\nTiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began.\nHer cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall.\nHer uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom.\nZlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage.\nHarel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral.\n\"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\"\nTiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nHarel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel.\nNetta Epstein\nIsraeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack.\nHis mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived.\nNetta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers.\nShachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion.\nShe said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service.\nHe was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city.\nShir Georgy\nIsraeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im.\nGeorgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death.\n\"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message.\nBouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured.\nGeorgy's funeral was held in Israel.\nAdi Vital-Kaploun\nAdi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa.\nThe group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area.\nThe family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack.\n\"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview.\nThe family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household.\nShe was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player.\nAfter completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said.\n\"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\"\nBen Mizrachi\nCanadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel.\nMizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C.\nEzra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force.\nHilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him.\nNurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school.\n\"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\"\nAlexandre Look\nAlexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival.\nLook, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post.\n\"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said.\nFriend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship.\nIn a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel.\nHe was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said.\n\"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "SAN ANTONIO — When kids go back to school, many of them are worried about being bullied. But parents shouldn't just be worried if their child is being bullied, but also if their child is the bully themselves. Research says there is a huge disparity between how parents see their kids when it comes to bullying behavior. Just under 14 percent of parents recognize their child is or has been a bully, but over 40 percent report their child has been bullied in the past year. \"You see aggressive behavior that goes beyond rebellion. And it's usually first towards the parents. So that's an alarm bell that goes off when, the parents start seeing this in their kids,\" said Dr. Vince Callahan, a professional counselor and Director of the Florida Institute for Neural Discovery. Here are some warning signs that may indicate bullying behaviors. - Being secretive like hiding phones or computers from others - Have a preference towards aggressive toys or media like violent video games or TV shows with conflict - Have an extreme desire for attention and if not met they could seek recognition or retaliation in harmful ways - Been a previous victim of bullying or are also being bullied \"They're either going to become like the aggressor, and themselves become bullies because they're trying to not get hurt, and they're trying to not feel that kind of dynamic going on, or they will, cower down and become even more insecure and get bullied more,\" Dr. Callahan said. Recognizing a liking for violence, whether on TV or reality should be a huge red flag. \"If someone is very much into the whole violence thing, and they don't have that conscience, that's the beginnings of a sociopath,\" Dr. Callahan added. \"So you get accustomed to gory violence and you think it's okay, and you're telling your brain that it's okay, and that really begins to set up some problems for the child later.\" Telehealth VocoVision says to prevent and address bullying behaviors, encourage healthy sleep, identify underlying health issues, model kindness, empathy, and respect, teach conflict resolution, and encourage open communication which increases a child's confidence. \"If I'm a child, that's a young child when I have a need, if my parents respond to that need and they talk to me and they connect with me, that sets me up for a whole life of confident behavior,\" said Dr. Callahan. Dr. Callahan tells us, a lot of times parents are in denial. \"Every parent wants to think that their child is the best and the brightest, and they're going to go to Harvard and have a law degree and all that kind of cool stuff, when in reality, they, they may have a problem on their hands and not want to realize it.\"",

    "text": "記者潘靚緯／台中報導\n▲一名55歲從事業務的陳小姐，罹患突發性耳聾，求診後靠高壓氧治療，成功搶救聽力。(圖／大里仁愛醫院提供)\n台中一名55歲從事業務的陳小姐，日前用手機聯絡客戶時，右耳突然聽不見聲音，換到左耳時又能正常聽到聲音，讓她非常緊張趕緊到耳鼻喉科就診，做完聽力檢查後，發現她罹患突發性耳聾，趕緊住院治療，並照會高壓氧中心安排高壓氧治療，經過四周的治療，終於恢復在生活中常使用的低頻區聽力，回歸正常生活。\n仁愛長庚合作聯盟醫院（大里仁愛醫院）耳鼻喉科主任李祥安表示，突發性耳聾是一種急性聽力受損的疾病，好發於40到60歲的中壯年人，但各年齡層都可能發生，常見症狀為突然發現其中一側之聽力減弱、耳鳴、耳悶感，甚至合併暈眩等等。突發性耳聾的診斷定義為：最近3日內，在純音聽力圖上連續3個頻率感覺神經性聽力與對側正常耳比較，有聽力下降超過30分貝。需特別注意的是，有時患側聽力只有部分頻率聽力受損，還是可以聽到部分的聲音，常會被疏忽而延誤了就醫及治療的黃金時間。\n▲經過四週的高壓氧治療，右耳的聽力（圖右）在低頻區已恢復至左耳的水準。(圖／大里仁愛醫院提供)\n李祥安主任表示，突發性耳聾又稱「耳中風」，但跟一般常見的腦中風(因腦血管血栓阻塞或腦動脈瘤破裂出血)不同，突發性耳聾目前可能的病因包含：內耳毛細胞組織缺血或缺氧、內耳內淋巴水腫、病毒感染導致之神經炎、自體免疫疾病或聽神經瘤等等。其中大約只有兩成的人可以找到確切病因，大部分病患的致病原因不明，在診斷及治療上帶來不少困擾。\n突發性耳聾的黃金治療期，通常是發病後的1到2週內，治療上以抗發炎藥物、改善血液循環及組織灌流為原則。目前療效最被確認的是類固醇藥物（包含口服、靜脈注射及內耳注射），其它治療包括：靜脈輸液、血漿擴張劑、末梢血管舒張劑等等。\n近年來已有許多文獻支持高壓氧用於突發性耳聾之輔助治療，藉由呼吸高壓純氧來增加血漿中氧氣的分壓及溶氧量，並增加內耳淋巴液之氧氣分壓。另外，高壓氧氣治療也可降低血容比、降低血液黏滯度及增加紅血球彈性，進而改善微循環，對改善組織血液灌流與缺氧有相當助益。在美國及台灣的高壓氧醫學會皆把突發性耳聾列為高壓氧治療適應症之一。\n李祥安主任建議，年紀小於50歲且有中重度聽力損失（平均聽力大於60分貝）的突發性耳聾病人，在傳統治療下再輔以高壓氧治療，更加提高恢復聽力的可能性。提醒民眾如果有突然聽力受損的狀況，在發生的1到2週內黃金治療期，應至耳鼻喉科檢查，經確認診斷後輔以高壓氧治療順利恢復聽力。\n更多新聞： 勾結詐團當「地面師」金主狠詐3.7億　歐悅集團執行長林冠宏300萬交保\n更多新聞： 下令追殺川普！伊朗宗教領袖號召全球穆斯林抓戰犯：處「斷肢極刑」\n更多新聞： 脊椎側彎90度像蜈蚣！21歲女大生站不直呼吸都痛　術後長高8CM超感動\n更多新聞： 常做惡夢比抽菸、肥胖更危險！早死風險高3倍　英研究：觸發壓力反應",
