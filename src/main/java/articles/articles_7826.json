    "text": "For Immediate Release:\nFebruary 29, 2024\nContact:\nTasgola Bruner 202-483-7382\nBeaumont, Texas – To encourage empathy for animals suffering in university laboratories, peta2—part of PETA’s youth division—is visiting Lamar University today and tomorrow with\nAbduction, a unique virtual reality experience landing on college campuses across the country. In this eerie experience, visitors will enter a mysterious truck containing a mobile virtual reality studio. The students will find themselves seemingly stranded in the desert with a couple of fellow humans, abducted by aliens, taken aboard a spaceship, and subjected to a shocking experience, similar to what animals endure in laboratories. They’ll watch as their friends are subjected to painful tests—knowing that they’ll be next.\nWhen: Thursday, February 29, and Friday, March 1, 11 a.m.–5 p.m.\nWhere: F-3 parking lot near Brooks-Shivers Dining Hall, Lamar University, Beaumont\nWatch the trailer here. Broadcast-quality footage of the Abduction virtual reality experience is available upon request.\n“Many students don’t know that on their own college campuses, frightened and confused animals are being psychologically tormented, mutilated, and killed in laboratories, with no way to escape or even understand what’s happening to them,” says peta2 Senior Director Rachelle Owen. “peta2 is on a mission to open young people’s eyes to this cruelty, help students understand what it feels like, and motivate them to join our call for a switch to superior, non-animal research.”\nStudies show that\n90% of all basic research—most of which involves animals—fails to lead to treatments for humans, which is why peta2 is pushing universities to pivot to sophisticated, human-relevant research methods.\nAbduction—which was filmed in VR180 with assistance from the immersive content creation studio Prosper XR—has stopped at nearly 50 other college campuses over the past year, including Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California–Los Angeles, and the University of Texas at Austin. Abduction won Gold and Audience honors at the 2023 Shorty Impact Awards.\npeta2—whose motto reads, in part, that “animals are not ours to experiment on”—helps young people make meaningful changes for animals in their everyday lives.

    "title": "Lesbian “Pastor” Reinstated by United Methodist Church After Being Defrocked in 2004",
    "text": "In a stunning yet unsurprising display of moral and doctrinal capitulation, the United Methodist Church (UMC) has reinstated Beth Stroud, a lesbian and self-described “pastor” who was defrocked in 2004 for openly defying the denomination’s longstanding prohibition against homosexual clergy. Stroud, who served as an associate “pastor” at Philadelphia’s First United Methodist “Church” of Germantown, was removed from her position after she revealed her lesbian relationship to her congregation—at the time, a clear violation of the UMC’s Book of Discipline.\nNow, nearly two decades later, the UMC has decided to reverse its stance, after it recently lifted its ban on homosexual clergy and same-sex marriages—a move that speaks volumes about the denomination’s surrender to cultural pressures.\nIn 2004, the UMC took a far more firm stand on the biblical teaching of sexuality by defrocking Stroud after she publicly declared her sexual relationship with another woman. This decision was a reflection of the denomination’s wider, global adherence to the clear teachings of Scripture on human sexuality. But over the last two decades, the UMC has not just drifted but jet-launched toward complete and total apostasy.\nThe church has not only reinstated Stroud but has also lifted its bans on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriages, abandoning any semblance of biblical fidelity, during its recent General Conference in Charlotte, NC. This reversal was a clear indication of the UMC’s descent into theological relativism and moral ambiguity.\nLet’s be clear: Beth Stroud’s reinstatement is not a victory for justice or inclusion—it is a capitulation to the relentless pressures of a society increasingly hostile to biblical truth. The notion of a lesbian “pastor” is a contradiction in terms—an affront to the Creator and His will for human flourishing. The Bible sets forth stringent qualifications for pastoral leadership, qualifications that include moral integrity and adherence to God’s design for human relationships. 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9 delineate these qualifications, emphasizing that a pastor must be “above reproach, the husband of one wife,” not a woman in an unrepentant homosexual relationship.\nThe very idea of women serving as pastors is unbiblical, let alone a lesbian. 1 Timothy 2:12 is unambiguous: “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.” The pastoral office is reserved for men, as established by God’s order in creation and reaffirmed throughout the New Testament. The UMC’s decision to not only reinstate Stroud but also to embrace the notion of LGBTQ clergy is a double departure from Scriptural mandates.\nIn its rush to appease the ever-demanding gods of progressivism, the UMC has effectively declared that cultural relevance is more important than biblical obedience. This is not compassion—it is cowardice. It is a tragic betrayal of the Gospel, which calls all people to repentance and transformation through the power of Christ. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 offers hope and redemption for those who turn from their sins, including sexual immorality. By normalizing and celebrating what God has declared sinful, the UMC is leading people draped in rainbow garb directly to the pits of Hell.\nThis is a reminder that when a denomination abandons the authority of Scripture, it inevitably succumbs to the impulses of cultural opinion. The UMC’s decision to embrace LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriages is a repudiation of its own heritage and a betrayal of the millions of Methodists worldwide who seek to live faithfully according to God’s Word.",

    "title": "SFL: Start 2024 With 30% Returns For This Undervalued Shipper",
    "text": "Thesis\nSFL Corp (NYSE:\nSFL) is a diversified shipping company that owns 73 vessels that serve various industries. From cargo containers, to cars, and deep-water drilling, SFL does it all. With a backbone structured around long-term contracts, SFL has been able to pay a dividend for nearly 20 years.\nThat is all about to change, and for the better. SFL is entering a period of revenue growth that will meaningfully expand its discretionary cash flow. Two main drivers will spur over 25% earnings growth.\n1. The receipt of four new car carrying vessels that are booked to premium long-term contracts will boost EBITDA by over 20%.\n2. The Hercules drilling vessel will generate enough additional free cash flow to cover a quarter of the dividend by itself. This vessel is leased under short term contracts to allow exposure to rapid expansion of deepwater drilling rates. 2025 may be even better than 2024.\nThese factors will translate into 33% dividend growth up to $0.33/share while also allowing for debt reductions to improve the balance sheet.\nLong-Term Contracts\nSFL's operating goal is to structure its business around long-term contracts with blue chip customers. The\ncurrent backlog stands at $3.4 billion with an average remaining charter term of 5.9 years. This model, spread over a fleet of 73 vessels in five operating segments, provides diversity to limit the risk associated with one industry, vessel, or customer.\nSFL can convert this operational stability into stability for its shareholders. While the dividend has not always grown, SFL has\npaid a dividend since 2004 and is currently on pace for its second year of dividend growth following a reduction in 2020-2021. This trend appears to have plenty of momentum behind it with four new car carrying vessels being delivered between Q4 and Q1 2024. All of these vessels are leased to 10-year contracts with options for further extension.\nRewarding Shareholders\nIn the\nfirst three quarters of 2023, SFL has generated $262.6 million in cash from operations on revenues of $542.7 million. These strong cash flows have been used to help fund a strong dividend that supports an 8.8% yield as well as commencing a $100 million share repurchase program in Q2 of this year. At the current rate of share retirement, the combined quarterly return equates to $0.25/share in cash and $0.04/share in equity or a 9.9% return in total.\nBy general market standards this is already a healthy return that is backed by years of contracted revenue stability. However, as we dig deeper, this analysis will show that this return is just the tip of the iceberg for SFL.\nInvestors have an opportunity to participate in a high yielding stock that has high growth potential hiding in plain sight.\nCarrying Cars for Profit\nIn addition to a high yield, SFL also has sufficient positive cash flow to also grow the business and improve the balance sheet. This effort has been aided by selling older vessels to recycle capital and ensure the fleet remains young and efficient. Thus far in 2023, SFL has invested over $200 million in new vessels which most notably includes four new car carrying vessels, two of which have entered service this year. By mid-2024, the remaining two new vessels should be complete and contributing to both the top and bottom lines for the company.\nThese four new vessels are expected to contribute approximately $23.5 million in EBITDA per vessel per year, or $94 million combined. At a price tag of approximately $77.5 million per vessel, this is an excellent use of capital. These vessels have a payback period of just over 3 years on a pre-tax basis.\nHaving these vessels secured at premium rates for 10-years to Volkswagen, the second largest car manufacturer globally, is a big deal to SFL. To give some perspective on the potential impact, SFL has made $325 million in EBITDA thus far this year and $433 million if annualized. The addition of these vessels brings the projected annualized total to $527 million. This equates to roughly 22% EBITDA growth from these vessels alone.\nGrowth in Oil is Growth for SFL\nIf the growth in the car carrier segment was not compelling enough, SFL's offshore program is also in an up-cycle. Over the last decade, profitability for offshore E&P companies has been challenged because of depressed oil prices starting from the onset of the US shale boom and continuing through the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Withering demand for offshore drilling rigs has caused several big players in this space to declare bankruptcy (Seadrill and Nobel). Such financial distress has all but stopped the construction of drill ships over the last several years.\nSFL only has two vessels in this category, the Linus and Hercules vessels. The Linus vessel is a harsh environment vessel that is\ncontracted out to ConocoPhillips until 2028. This vessel has contracted market adjustments every 6 months to produce stable and rising cash flows.\nConversely, the Hercules vessel is an ultra-deep water semi-submersible vessel that has been employed on relatively shorter-term contacts. SFL has been hesitant to allow Hercules to be committed to a long-term contract to prevent from missing out on the full upside of the current cycle.\nRates for these types of vessels have been screaming upwards over the last year now that projects off the coasts of Guyana, Suriname, and Namibia are in various stages of production and exploration. These projects are more than sufficient to keep the existing fleet at high levels of utilization.\nWood Mackenzie projects that drilling vessel supply will continue to remain extremely tight through 2027 with the current project slate. This is a huge tail wind for SFL despite having only two vessels. The Hercules vessel most recently secured a contract at a rate of $500k/day. This is over 10 time the rate of a tanker vessel and over 5 times the rate of the brand-new car carrier vessels. Therefore, changes in this market can have a large impact for SFL.\nThe table below summarized the current contract landscape for the Hercules vessel.\n| |\nLocation\n| |\nDuration\n| |\nRate\n| |\nCanada (Exxon)\n| |\n135 days - Start Q2 2023\n| |\n$50 million or $370k/d\n| |\nNamibia (Galp Energia)\n| |\n115 days - Start Q4 2023\n| |\n$50 million or $435k/d\n| |\nCanada (Equinor Canada)\n| |\n200 days - Start Q2 2024\n| |\n$100 million or $500k/d\nAt the start of Equinor contract, the Hercules will realize $130k/d in additional revenue compared to the most recent quarter. Using an average day rate of $461.5k/d, this vessel will be able to generate an additional $33.5 million of revenue over the course of 2024. More importantly, since this does not require any additional operating expenses, this additional revenue flows straight to the bottom line.\n2025 may be even more prosperous for the offshore segment. Multiple CEOs from the big offshore players have commented during quarterly conference calls on where they feel the offshore drilling market is headed.\nRobert Eifler provides Nobel's projection for what rates would be required to justify building a modern drilling vessel.\n\"Hypothetical new build with comparable capabilities as the current Tier 1 seventh generation drillship would likely cost at least $850 million to build and require at least 3 years, if not longer, for delivery. In order to underwrite that asset, a rational buyer would require a contract of 10 years at $650,000 per day or greater or some variation of rate and term along those lines.\"\n\"So, we're approaching the $500,000 day rate threshold, a bit more slowly than we had previously expected. But if you scratch a little deeper, what you find is that the UDW market is still in fact tightening, due to the steady absorption of the sideline capacity.\nAdditionally, major projects in Namibia and Suriname are poised to drive incremental rigs requirements and established UDW basins such as Angola and Nigeria continued to trend higher. The methodical absorption of sideline capacity has had a bifurcating effect on day rates over the short-term.\"\nMatt Lyne, COO at Valaris also\nshared his views on the offshore drilling market.\nSo, I mean, we feel really good about where the market sits today and the longevity of the cycle. So, I guess, if we look at a couple of the supply metrics to kind of lead us down that path, which will directly relate to continued improvement in the day rate, lead times for tendering for contracts are increasing. And we're also seeing, as you were pointing out, customers increasing duration by connecting their programs to make it more attractive.\nAnd why would they be doing that would be, if they see potential or they see supply decreasing, which incentivizes them to pick up rigs for longer to ensure they have the assets they need to drill.\nUtilization is increasing, which is obviously resulting in a reduction in supply. And so looking at these main factors from a supply side metrics, it paints a positive picture on the direction of the market.\nAs one could imagine, rising rates on these vessels also increases their net worth. I assume the current net worth of the Hercules vessel to be 70% of a newbuild given the tight supply of vessels and the long lead time to construct a new vessel. Using the $850 million price tag given by Nobel CEO Robert Eifler, this would give the Hercules vessel a value of $595 million. This creates two interesting investment perspectives.\n1. With a market cap of approximately $1.5 billion, SFL represents a compelling discount to NAV play. The combined value of the four new builds and the Hercules is roughly $900 million. This values the remaining 68 vessels at just $600 million.\n2. The opportunity to monetize the Hercules vessel would give SFL incredible financial leverage to expand the fleet or reduce its debt if it chose to do so. While this would obviously hurt overall revenue, there is a lot to be said for locking in the equivalent of multiple years of revenue in one stroke of the pen.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe combined effect of the new car carrier vessels and the increased rate for the drilling vessel Hercules results in an increase of $127 million in EBITDA or 29% growth. Assuming a tax rate of 25% leaves $95 million in excess cash flows annually as SFL exits 2024. With $136 million in CAPEX spending still remaining for the three remaining newbuild car carriers, I will assume interest expenses to rise an additional $10 million per year (7.5% interest rate), leaving $85 million remaining.\nThe expense of the dividend at its current value is approximately $121 million annually. Allocating half of the projected discretionary funds to the dividend would result in a 33% increase to $0.33/share while also leaving surplus cash for debt reduction. This will have the combo effect of driving share appreciation to match the dividend growth. If SFL were to continue to trade at a 9% yield, the corresponding share price would rise to $14.67/share, implying 30% upside to the current share price. I would expect even further price appreciation should a higher percentage of cash flow be allocated to the dividend.\nRisks\nThe current debt load of SFL is not significant enough to call it a \"problem\" but is high enough to be considered an overall drag on investor returns. The current interest payment plus the projected increase in debt associated with financing newbuilds will take the annual interest expense to north of $170 million. This is over 20% of annual revenue, so getting this figure down would be beneficial in freeing up incremental free cash flow.\nSFL has been able to make moderate amounts of progress this year by retiring over $100 million in net debt thus far in 2023. This may be a challenge in the near term with $136 million still required to complete the last two car carrying vessels. Moving forward, it would be wise for SFL to allocate a portion of the new cash flows to debt retirement.\nSummary\nUsing the projections above, annualized EBITDA is slated to grow to over $550 million by the end of 2024 for over 25% growth. This growth is funded by four newbuild vessels entering service in addition to substantial charter rate growth by the Hercules semi-submersible drilling vessel. With little to no excess capacity in the under-water drilling market, I expect the trend in rate growth to continue into 2025 as well.\nThe combination of these drivers provides approximately $85 million in additional free cash flow to drive both dividend growth and debt reduction. Splitting this additional FCF evenly allows for dividend growth of 33% to $0.33/share or 11% at today's price of $11.72/share. I rate SFL as a strong buy with potential appreciation of approximately 30% coupled with a high yield. After collecting dividends, I anticipate total returns to exceed 30% over an 18-24 month holding period.",

    "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - As freezing rain begins tonight, roads will become slick in a hurry. Your First Alert: Icy conditions tonight into Saturday The good news is we will remain quiet for the rest of Friday afternoon, and even well into the evening hours. Temperatures will remain chilly, especially when factoring in an easterly wind between 10 to 20 mph. Still, the thermometer creeps upward, and readings in the 20s are likely by late today. Those will still be notably below freezing, though, and the cold air will be in a shallow layer near the surface. Above it, a layer of warmer air will be moving in up and ahead of a frontal boundary that stays to our south. This is the type of setup that creates the risk for freezing rain, and that will be centered on the state of Iowa. An Ice Storm Warning is in effect for much of the area between Highway 30 and Highway 20. The rest of the TV9 viewing area is under a Winter Weather Advisory. Both areas are to highlight where the potential for freezing rain exists. Precipitation holds off in the TV9 viewing area until at least 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., first entering some of our far southern and western counties. Many parts of the viewing area will hold off until Midnight or later, with precipitation becoming especially widespread later tonight. This sets up a very icy start to Saturday, with most areas still experiencing freezing rain or a wintry mix at and after daybreak. Warmer temperatures will continue to spread northward, so as locations reach or exceed 32 degrees, the threat for additional ice accumulation will end. The exact timing of this change is notoriously hard to nail down, but we should start to see it reach near Interstate 80 around 9:00 a.m. Areas along and south of Highway 20 will have a good shot to improve to just plain rain by around Noon. North of that corridor, colder air will be more stubborn, so a mix of rain, snow, and a bit of freezing rain will be possible. Ice accumulation has the potential to be substantial within the areas where an Ice Storm Warning is in effect. Totals could reach to 0.25″ or just a bit higher in spots. Outside of that central portion of the viewing area, we’re still expecting at least a glaze of ice. Any little amount is enough to cause travel issues; heavier accumulations could lead to some tree damage with breezy easterly winds. Some snow may stick in our northern zones in particular, with this accumulation adding to any travel issues. How you should react to this storm system The biggest hazard with freezing rain is the impact on travel, whether walking or in a vehicle. Avoid both, if possible, when icy conditions are present. If you must drive, slow down! Give plenty of room between you and the vehicle in front of you. Avoid sudden braking or sharp turns which could cause you to lose traction. Approach intersections with extra caution. Pack a winter survival kit if you drive away from populated areas. If you head out on foot, pay especially close attention to untreated paved surfaces, including sidewalks and parking lots. These can be slicker than they appear. Use a railing for balance if available, or consider walking in the grass where the plant life provides some additional traction. Wear appropriate footwear to help decrease the chance of a fall. We also recommend the KCRG-TV9 First Alert Weather App , which can give you customized alerts for your location, as well as road conditions available from a button on the home screen of the app. Of course, we’ll also provide updates on KCRG.com and KCRG-TV9 as conditions warrant. Generally quieter with a few precipitation chances After this storm system exits the region, warmer air will continue to move in. This pushes our highs pretty decently above normal by Sunday into Monday, with lows in the 30s and highs in the low to mid 40s for most. Clouds will remain common, however. Another disturbance brings a shot at some showers late on Sunday night into Monday. Our air should be warm enough to avoid any icy issues with this round, and the heaviest precipitation will fall to the east and southeast of the viewing area. Another break is likely on Tuesday as cooler air makes a return. The downward trend in temperatures continues for the remainder of the 9-day. Most of us will experience lows in the 10s and 20s, with highs in the upper 20s to mid 30s, during this stretch of time. A storm system could bring a shot at some snow by the middle of the week on Wednesday. This outcome isn’t fully certain, however, with some significant differences among the computer models we use to help make our forecasts on the timing and path of the system. We’ll keep a close eye on it and bring you the latest as we know it. Copyright 2024 KCRG. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO – While constructing its own climate-monitoring constellation, Silicon startup Muon Space is earning more than $60 million designing, building and operating remote-sensing satellites for customers. The 10 satellites under contract, ranging in size from 150 to 500 kilograms, are scheduled to launch in 2025 and 2026 for commercial, government and nonprofit organizations. Muon Space CEO and co-founder Jonny Dyer declined to identify the customers. “We’ll let them take the lead on sharing that information if and when they would like to,” Dyer told SpaceNews by email. Muon Space launched its first satellite in June to demonstrate Muon Halo , the company’s integrated hardware and software platform. A second Muon Space satellite, launched March 4 on the SpaceX Transporter-10 rideshare flight, is a prototype weather satellite for the U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Weather Systems Branch and the Defense Innovation Unit . Space as a Service Muon Space developed Muon Halo for customers seeking space-based data who did not have the expertise or desire to develop spacecraft, establish ground networks or handle data processing. “A big selling point for many customers has been our standard process of developing a high-fidelity digital twin of their system,” Dyer said. The digital twin then “becomes the anchor for all the downstream systems engineering, integration and on-orbit operations optimization that happens through a mission lifecycle.” Selling end-to-end constellation services has been part of Muon Space’s plan since the company was founded in Mountain View, California, in 2021. Some Muon Space co-founders, who met while working on the Environmental Defense Fund’s MethaneSat, “believed that a holistic, mission-oriented product offering coupled with advances in technology and reductions in launch prices provided a big opportunity to enable a new class of commercial missions,” Dyer said. Formulation to Operations Early customers paid Muon Space to formulate constellation plans. “We have been successful in growing our customer base and expanding many of them into build and operations phases,” Dyer said. He attributed the firm’s success in attracting and retaining customers to its focus on reliability, its core hardware and software, and Muon Space’s skilled workforce. Muon Space has contracts to provide Earth-observation data to the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space Force . The National Reconnaissance Office also tapped Muon Space to provide multispectral electro-optical and infrared data from its future climate-monitoring constellation. In a 2022 Series A funding round, Muon Space raised $25 million. The company also announced a $10 million seed round in 2021.",

    "title": "‘Winning Issue’?: Michigan Dems Hope Abortion Will Help Harris Thwart Trump in Swing State",
    "text": "With the Kamala Harris campaign reportedly fearing it will lose Michigan , Democratic strategists in the key Midwestern swing state are placing their hopes on the issue of abortion to give the vice president an edge on Nov. 5.\nDemocrats participated in a Monday webinar , co-hosted by midwestern lobbying firm Kelley Cawthorne and news service Gongwer Michigan, for clients and subscribers to hear from those working on the November elections.\nOne of the most hotly contested swing states , with its 15 Electoral College votes, Michigan may determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to hold a one percentage point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in a two-way race. Trump and Harris are in a dead heat in an eight-way race, which is what Michiganders will see on their ballots, according to an Oct. 16 Mitchell Research & Communications poll.\nThe Harris campaign fears it can’t win Michigan, NBC News reported.\n“There has been a thought that maybe Michigan or Wisconsin will fall off,” a senior Harris campaign official said to NBC, adding that the bigger concern of the two is Michigan.\nWisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania make up the “blue wall,” which have delivered the win to the last two Democratic presidents.\nIn the Monday webinar reviewed by The Daily Signal, Celinda Lake, the founder of Lake Research Partners, a liberal Democratic political strategy research firm, said she thinks it will be hard for Democrats to win on the economic issue because voters “give a lot of credibility to Republicans” on it, especially since Trump is a businessman.\nAs a result, she recommended Michigan Democrats zero in on abortion.\n“The formula for success is to be even on the economy and win on abortion, honestly,” Lake said.\nLake told The Daily Signal she didn’t say abortion is “more important” than the economy, but that it’s a “clear distinction.”\n“It’s important to have [an] economic argument, too,” Lake said in an email. “[Michigan] is close, but with the demographics and women leadership, I think we will win.”\nThe economy ranks as the most important issue to voters, according to a Gallup poll conducted Sept. 16 to 28.\nThe current 52% of voters rating the economy as an “extremely important” influence on their vote for president is the highest since October 2008 amid the Great Recession.\nVoters view Trump as better able to handle the economy than Harris by 10 percentage points. Harris holds a 16 percentage point lead on Trump for how she’d handle abortion.\n“Abortion is a clear distinction, like who’s really good on inflation policy or rising cost of living, is hard for people to sort out,” Lake said.\nMichigan Democratic state Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou said abortion is a “winning issue” on the ballot.\n“I think everyone knows it’s a winning issue, which is why even Trump keeps trying to suggest that he supports choice,” the Michigan state lawmaker said. “I mean, time and time again, he keeps suggesting that he is, you know, in some way pro-choice, which is completely false and not true. But polling, you know, does tell us that choice is a very important factor in how people are choosing their leaders now.”\nTsernoglou did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.\nTrump has said abortion restrictions are up to the states, and he does not support a national ban on abortion.\n“My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” Trump said in a video posted to social media.\nZach Gorchow, president of Gongwer Michigan, the Michigan-based news service that sponsored the webinar, said Democratic candidates throughout the country are putting a heavy emphasis in their messaging on protecting abortion rights.\nIn TV ads, Democrats say that “the Democratic candidate will protect a right to an abortion, the Republican candidate will not and may even favor the old, now-repealed law that criminalized it,” Gorchow said.\nGorchow moderated the webinar on behalf of Gongwer Michigan. He moderated a Republican strategy panel sponsored by his organization a few weeks ago.\nGorchow told The Daily Signal he believes abortion is “a helpful piece of the puzzle” for Democrats, “given that Michigan voters by a 57-43 margin voted to legalize abortion in 2022, and [the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade] helped propel them to control of state government for the first time in 40 years.”\n“But candidates for statewide elections, to be successful, generally have to emphasize multiple issues. Michigan is a diverse state and generally rolling with a single-issue message does not work,” he said.\nMichigan passed Proposal 3 in the midterm elections, which added an amendment to the Michigan Constitution allowing abortion throughout pregnancy if necessary to protect a woman’s “life or physical or mental health.”\nLake said Michigan Democrats should use the abortion issue to win over young women, who she presented as crucial for a Harris win in the Great Lakes State.\nShe said that young women turned out in record numbers in Kansas after the June 2022 Supreme Court Dobbs decision.\n“Young women have been very motivated by abortion,” Lake said.\nStill, she said, “we have got to work” to get young women to the polls, particularly “low-propensity” women who are eligible to vote, but who have a history of infrequently doing so.\nAccording to Lake, it’s likely that there will be a “Trump surge” among young men who were registered to vote, but chose not to do so in the 2020 election. She said young women and blacks have the potential of creating a “Harris surge.”\nLake said that Democrats must have clear, direct messaging on abortion to help “mobilize” voters to go to the polls in November.\n“People have just taken extreme, extreme positions,” Lake said, “and the clarity of this issue really helps to mobilize Democrats and young women.”",
