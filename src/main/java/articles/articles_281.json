    "title": "«Con il Black Friday e il Natale i dipendenti della Posta devono fare sforzi sovrumani»",
    "text": "«Con il Black Friday e il Natale i dipendenti della Posta devono fare sforzi sovrumani»\n«La scorsa settimana il periodico Cooperazione ha pubblicato un’intervista al CEO della Posta Roberto Cirillo, in cui il direttore del gigante giallo sostiene che negli ultimi anni il carico di lavoro per collaboratrice o collaboratore è sceso». È con questo esempio che si apre un comunicato di transfair, volto a denunciare le «reali condizioni dei dipendenti del Gigante Giallo» in questo periodo dell'anno. Secondo il sindacato, quella di Cirillo è infatti «un’affermazione del tutto generalizzata che per determinate unità non corrisponde in alcun modo alla verità – soprattutto non per il periodo prenatalizio».\nA detta di transfair, questa affermazione non corrisponde «in nessun caso» alla verità. Soprattutto, per il personale dell’unità spartizione/recapito. Nello specifico, secondo il sindacato, le collaboratrici e i collaboratori sono «alle prese con una crescente mole di lavoro», in particolare, come detto, nella spartizione e nel recapito dei pacchi. Transfair rivela infatti di essere «a conoscenza di casi in cui le giornate lavorative di 10 ore o più sono la norma, al punto che le collaboratrici e i collaboratori si ammalano e le assenze dal lavoro aumentano». Inoltre, se un membro del team si assenta all’ultimo momento, «gli altri dipendenti devono sobbarcarsi il sovraccarico di lavoro», dando origine a un circolo vizioso.\nI problemi risultano evidenti proprio in questo momento dell'anno. Nel periodo prenatalizio, mentre tutti sono alle prese con i regali, il carico di lavoro risulta essere «particolarmente elevato». Tanto che, secondo transfair, in occasione del Black Friday e di Natale i volumi dei pacchi raggiungeranno nuovamente picchi da record. Nello specifico, ogni giorno dovranno essere elaborati fino a un milione di pacchi e 13 milioni di lettere e invii pubblicitari. Ed è qui che nasce il problema. Come denuncia il sindacato, per sbrigare l’ondata di spedizioni, il personale addetto alla spartizione e al recapito sarà quindi «chiamato a fare sforzi sovrumani». Ma «senza turni extra-lunghi e una settimana lavorativa di 6 giorni, non è possibile sbrigare una mole di lavoro del genere»\nPer transfair si tratta di «una prova di forza che lascia il segno sul personale». Greta Gysin, Consigliera nazionale e presidente di transfair, si esprime con parole chiare: «Ogni anno, il periodo prenatalizio è un periodo di puro stress per il personale. Le collaboratrici e i collaboratori addetti alla spartizione e al recapito lavorano già moltissimo durante tutto l’anno, ma in queste settimane sono spesso costretti a superare i loro limiti. La conseguenza: malattie e assenze. È inaccettabile che, anno dopo anno, vengano minate le disposizioni del CCL»\nMa non finisce qui: sì, perché le disposizioni del CCL non vengono eluse soltanto nel periodo natalizio. In un appello via e-mail al direttore della Posta, transfair ha pertanto chiesto che la settimana lavorativa di 42 ore, prevista dal CCL Posta CH, venga finalmente applicata anche al recapito e alla spartizione dei pacchi.",

    "text": "In a new memoir, ‘Never: The Autobiography,’ the English rocker opens up about “Never Gonna Give You Up,” the viral meme that followed and how instant fame affected his personal life\nBy Luke Chinman Luke Chinman Luke Chinman is an editorial intern at PEOPLE. He joined PEOPLE in 2024. His work has previously appeared in The Berkshire Eagle and Luxe Interiors + Design . People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 23, 2025 05:03PM EST 2 Comments Rick Astley in 1982 and in 2025. Photo: Frank Hempel/United Archives via Getty; Alan Chapman/Dave Benett/Getty\nRick Astley may be cemented in music history for the viral “Rickrolling” prank, but he’s never actually pulled it himself.\nTwo decades after the English singer’s iconic track “Never Gonna Give You Up” became an instant sensation — topping charts in the United States, United Kingdom and more — the ’80s earworm was introduced to a new generation, thanks to one of the Internet’s first viral moments. In 2007, a YouTube user posted what appeared to be the link to a new video game trailer on an online forum, but it redirected to the charmingly cheesy music video to Astley’s hit song.\nThe rest is history.\nThe meme — named Rickrolling — took off, helping the music video rack up more than 1 billion views and counting. And Astley scored his first No. 1 album in decades, started to sell out arenas and made his Glastonbury debut at age 57.\nRick Astley Waited to Write a Memoir Until His Parents Had Passed So He Could Be ‘Completely Honest’ (Exclusive) He narrates his unusual trajectory as a pop icon — rising to stardom at 21, his “retirement” from music in his late 20s amid a depressive period and his return to the spotlight as “Never Gonna Give You Up” got its second wind — in a new memoir, Never: The Autobiography , out Jan. 21.\nNever: The Autobiography by Rick Astley. Pan Macmillan\nSpeaking exclusively to PEOPLE, Astley, now 58, reveals that he’s only instigated the prank “professionally” — through brand partnerships and at live events — but not on his own.\n“I’ve never really appreciated what it is, I think, because I’ve just had to sort of shut down that part of my brain,” says the star. “I was lucky enough that it happened when I was a lot older, and I was like, ‘The guy in the video, yes, I know it’s my physicality, but it’s not me.’ I’ve got enough distance.”\nRick Astley on the First Time He Was Rick-Rolled: \"I Kept Thinking, 'What Is This Idiot Doing?'\" After the meme exploded, he Rickrolled the live audience at the 2008 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and he’s been pranked himself by a fan on Reddit. When the meme started gaining traction, Astley says, he actually leaned on his teen daughter for advice about how to navigate his viral moment.\nRick Astley in 1988. Vinnie Zuffante/Getty\n“She was saying, ‘Don’t sweat it. It has nothing to do with you,’ ” he remembers. “And I’m like, ‘How can it have nothing to do with me?’ And she said, ‘Just leave it where it is. Don’t try to embrace it and try funny things with it.’ ”\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nSo that’s what Astley did, and the song ballooned in success. He still sticks “Never Gonna Give You Up” at the end of his concert setlists — even when many artists would scoff at the expectation that they play a 40-year-old song every night.\n“I understand a lot of artists would freak and would have a meltdown if somebody instigated this thing,” acknowledges Astley, but adds that he “appreciates the life it gave me.”\nRick Astley in 2024. Mike Lewis Photography/Redferns\n“It introduced that song to a lot of people and a generation that would have no clue, and that’s kind of gold dust really,” he says. “I’ve learned to appreciate that it’s part of my DNA.”\nThe performer also isn’t afraid to admit that there was “so much luck involved” in the song’s massive popularity: “You can either recognize it as that, even at the time or certainly later, or you can say, ‘No, I’m amazing, it would’ve happened anyway.’ And I fall into the first camp,” says Astley.\n“There’s people who probably have more talent than me who didn’t get their goal for whatever reason,” the rocker continues. “I can get quite emotional about that at times, because the luck involved in having a hit record that’s a lifechanger is so narrow a bandwidth, it’s unbelievable.”\nNever: The Autobiography is available now, wherever books are sold.\nClose",

    "text": "Hubballi: Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi criticised the Congress government in the State over the hijab row, stating that \"There should be limits to dividing society, but Congress is exceeding them\".\nJoshi condemned the statements of Congress leaders and ministers, claiming that the previous BJP government had not banned the hijab, and Muslim women continue to wear it regularly. He added that Siddaramaiah is not fit to be the chief minister of the State.\n\"A couple of years ago, when a college principal asked the government about the hijab issue at their college, the government ordered that all students should wear uniforms in the school-colleges. The same order was upheld by the High Court, and the court also stated that hijab is not a mandatory part of Islam. Later, the issue was taken to the Supreme Court. No government has banned hijab,\" Joshi said.\n\"Although there is no ban on hijab, the Congress government in the State is betraying society by misguiding people. It is foolishness on Siddaramaiah's part to cover up their failures. After Congress lost in the recently held assembly elections in five states, the party is attempting to divert attention from their debacle. People are living peacefully, but Congress is trying to create differences in society,\" he added.\n“After meeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Siddaramaiah behaves like this, and he might be influenced by Rahul Gandhi. I strongly condemn the utter nonsense by Siddaramaiah and Congress leaders, who are appeasing Muslims to secure their votes in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls (sic),” Joshi said, mocking Congress leaders.\nSuspecting external instructions over the Congress protest during parliamentary sessions in New Delhi, Joshi said the Congress party lost polls in four States, hence their \"mental imbalance has increased\".\n\"Before the winter session, in all-party meetings, the Congress leaders agreed not to stage protests with placards in the house well. On the first day, the Congress leaders participated in the session for over 40 minutes. After they received instructions from outside, they staged a protest with placards at the house well,\" Joshi alleged.\n\"Congress is a confused party, so they started a disturbance in the house. Congress leaders wanted suspension in the house; they started to request the chairman to suspend them and also brought placards. Such mentality of Congress leaders shows how much they are interested in the happenings of the country,\" Joshi claimed.\n\"The decision of the union government to replace the existing British-era criminal laws with new three bills has become a big embarrassment for the Congress leaders, which led to a ruckus in the house. Despite several letters by Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar to AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, the Congress top brass has not agreed to visit the Vice President to discuss the issue,” Joshi said.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 24 December 2023, 14:13 IST)",

    "text": "速览\n- 网传视频所谓的“迫降”实际为C919飞机模型在运输途中的画面。该模型4月25日于山东制作完成并运输至安徽芜湖，后续将模拟驾驶舱，用作科普教育。网传说法完全是扭曲事实，容易造成误导。\n事件背景\n近日，海外社交平台广泛传播一段视频，声称是“C919迫降在山东章丘农田里的画面”。然而，该视频画质模糊，且机型特征与C919似乎有所出入，存在诸多疑点，“澎湃明查”就此画面进行了核查。\n网传视频截图 明查\n根据C919机型的主要特征，其驾驶舱有四块风挡玻璃，且中轴线部分呈“V”状。然而，网传视频拍摄的“飞机”风挡玻璃并非如此，且画面中“飞机”没有机翼，似乎并未组装完成。\nC919风挡玻璃图 网传视频截图 此外，在国内视频平台检索C919近期视频，可以发现不少IP为安徽芜湖的网友发布了类似的“飞机”画面，并指出，4月27日左右，“搭载着C919机身的运输车出现于芜湖的街道上”，这类视频画面拍摄到了这架飞机注册号为B-001A。\n网传出现于安徽芜湖的飞机画面，该机身与“网传章丘迫降飞机”十分相似。\n但需要指出的是，真正的B-001A是C919客机的首架原型机，于2017年进行首次试飞，其涂装与网传视频差别明显，且该飞机应位于上海浦东新区，全球航班信息数据库Flightradar24近期并无飞行记录。\nJet Photos收录今年3月30日拍摄于浦东的B-001A\n根据芜湖出现的机身线索继续追踪，可以得知该机身实际为C919飞机模型，已被运送到芜湖三山星悦广场用作模拟参观。\n为了确认芜湖出现的机身与章丘出现的机身是否一致，“澎湃明查”联系了发起制作这架飞机模型的安徽芜湖久旺集成房负责人张贤忠，他表示， 网传视频拍摄的其实是飞机模型，该模型4月25日在章丘制作完成并开始运输，4月27日抵达芜湖市。负责人强调，制作该飞机模型的本意是为了帮助“进行科普教育，传播正能量”。 按计划，该模型未来将设计1:1全真模拟驾驶舱以提供航空体验。\n综上所述，网传视频所谓的“迫降”实际为C919飞机模型在运输途中的画面。该模型4月25日于山东制作完成并运输至安徽芜湖，后续将模拟驾驶舱，用作科普教育。网传说法完全是扭曲事实，容易造成误导。\n明查员 陶亚迪",
