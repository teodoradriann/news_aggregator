    "text": "With traffic congestion, industrial emissions, and agricultural burning contributing to high levels of PM2.5, Bangkok faces an ongoing battle to improve air quality, putting public health at risk and prompting urgent action from authorities BANGKOK, Thailand – Bangkok, the bustling capital of Thailand, is frequently grappling with air pollution, which has become a growing concern for both residents and visitors. The city’s air quality often reaches levels considered hazardous to health, especially during the cooler months from November to February, when temperature inversions trap pollutants close to the ground.\nThe primary contributors to air pollution in Bangkok are vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and open burning of agricultural waste, particularly during the annual burning season in neighboring regions. Traffic congestion is a significant factor, with thousands of vehicles on the road, emitting exhaust fumes that contribute to the high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air.\nPM2.5, tiny particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are of particular concern because they can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular issues. During periods of poor air quality, air pollution in Bangkok often exceeds the World Health Organization’s recommended limits, putting vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions at greater risk.\nIn addition to vehicle emissions and industrial activities, the agricultural burning season in neighboring countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar contributes to the city’s smog problem. Farmers often burn rice fields and other crops, sending plumes of smoke into the air that can significantly reduce visibility and worsen air quality in Bangkok.\nThe Thai government and local authorities have taken various measures to address the issue, including implementing air quality monitoring systems, promoting the use of electric vehicles, and improving public transportation infrastructure to reduce traffic-related emissions. However, air pollution remains a persistent problem due to rapid urbanization, high population density, and inadequate enforcement of environmental regulations.\nDuring times of high pollution, residents of Bangkok are advised to stay indoors, limit physical activity, and use air purifiers to reduce exposure to harmful pollutants. The government has also issued air quality warnings, encouraging people to wear face masks and take precautions, especially in areas with the highest levels of pollution.\nIn conclusion, air quality in Bangkok remains a significant environmental and public health challenge. While steps are being taken to improve the situation, continued efforts are needed to reduce emissions, promote cleaner alternatives, and raise public awareness about the dangers of air pollution.",

    "title": "Avian flu: Why a cold winter is leading to more H5N1 cases among birds",
    "text": "A colder than average winter has meant an increase in highly pathogenic\navian influenza (H5N1) among birds, according to officials.\nHeather Reid, the Toronto Wildlife Centre's head veterinarian, said the organization began to notice signs of the virus among the city’s bird population at the start of 2025.\n\"In January, after we started having very cold weather, we started seeing increased reporting of suspicious birds that were showing symptoms that seemed consistent with avian influenza,” she said.\n\"The virus can survive cold weather, and as the water freezes, the birds are forced to be together in the open waters,” Reid explained. “Probably the stress of the cold also might weaken the birds a little bit.”\nThe seasonal uptick in cases of H5N1 among birds is not unheard of. Following a cold snap in 2024’s winter season, Reid said there were also increased reports of avian flu among birds in Toronto.\nIt is possible, but very rare, for a human to contract bird flu. Spread through animal feces and secretions, including mucus and saliva, human transmission can occur when the virus gets into a person's mouth, nose, eyes or is inhaled.\nThere is no evidence to suggest eating cooked poultry or eggs could transmit H5N1 to humans.\nCanada has so far seen one confirmed human case of avian flu.\nIn November 2024, a 13-year-old in British Columbia contracted the country’s first known human case of avian flu after testing positive for the virus. The teen spent about two months in hospital,\nsome of it on life support in an ICU.\nThere is no evidence of sustained person-to-person spread of the virus — though that doesn’t mean Canada’s government is simply standing by.\nOn Wednesday, the Public Health Agency of Canada\nannounced it has secured an initial supply of 500,000 doses of a vaccine against the H5N1 strain of avian influenza that is currently circulating.\nThe highest priority for eventual vaccine distribution will be given to people who may be at risk of contact with infected animals.\nWill avian flu continue in the spring?\nAvian flu, similarly to human influenza, is seasonal and there are several strains of the virus, with some worse than others.\nAccording to Reid at the Toronto Wildlife Centre, it's still an open question what will happen with the rate of bird flu during warmer weather.\nReid said there could be an increase of avian flu among birds when migratory flocks return to Toronto in the spring.\n\"Birds are coming back and they're also grouping together again, and maybe some of them are bringing the virus,” she said.\nBut even if there is an uptick in the spring months, Reid expects rates to drop again come June.\n\"Usually, the virus doesn't survive well in hot temperatures, so we do see it resolving in the summer months,\" she said.\nIn the meantime, there are still risks associated with the presence of bird flu in Toronto.\nOther animals that feed on the carcasses of birds that have died of H5N1 can become infected.\nThough waterfowl are the most common natural carriers of avian influenza, Reid said other birds of prey like owls, hawks, falcons and crows can die after feeding on infected birds.\nIn the spring of 2023,\na dog died in Oshawa after it was found chewing on a dead goose that likely carried avian flu pathogens.\nThe risk of infection is a good reason to keep dogs on leash and cats indoors, Reid said.",

    "title": "Scoot: Donald Trump, the Bible salesman - you're kidding, right?",
    "text": "By Scoot ,\n11 hours ago\nIt’s Easter Week and salvation is at hand!\nBusinessman turned politician turned Bible salesman, Donald Trump is hawking a $60 Bible he is calling the “God Bless The U.S.A. Bible” that is “For Your Soul.” The idea of Donald Trump as a Bible salesman is laughable.\nWe all know that Donald Trump desperately needs money, in spite of his countless proclamations about how he is mega rich. In a video released this week, Trump announced he was selling the “God Bless The U.S.A. Bible and talked about how “very important” it is to him. Trump acted like a televangelist when he said, “You have to have it for your heart, for your soul.” “Religion and Christianity are the biggest things missing from this country,” Trump continued. Trump declared the Bible to be his favorite book.\nIs it even believable that Donald Trump, of all people, holds the Bible as his favorite book?\nIn the years since he began running for president, Donald Trump has been awkwardly inarticulate in the things he has said about the Bible. During a speech at Liberty University in 2016, Trump began talking about “Two Corinthians 3:17” instead of the correct reference of “Second Corinthians 3:17.” Trump read the verse: “Where the Spirit of the Lord, right? There is liberty.” “And here there is Liberty college, but, Liberty University, but it is so true.” What???\nIn an interview in 2015, Donald Trump was asked what was his favorite Bible verse and he said he “didn’t want to go into specifics.” Have you ever known anyone who claims to revere the Bible and its significance that did not have a favorite verse? No! Literally, anyone who claims to appreciate the attributes of the Bible can immediately recite several favorite Bible verses. But not Donald Trump.\nI understand that no one really knows what lives in another person’s heart, but we all know that words are cheap. It’s easy for anyone to say anything, but it is difficult to live up to the words one speaks. Let’s take a look at Donald Trump’s words and his behavior and compare them to his claim that the Bible is his favorite book.\nTrump lied and falsified medical records to keep from being drafted during the Vietnam War.\nTrump has expressed love and respect for dictators, enemies of the United States.\nTrump was banging a porn star while his wife, Melania was pregnant with their son Barron\nTrump also had sex with a Playboy Playmate while married to Melania.\nTrump paid money to his mistresses to cover up his adulterous affairs.\nTrump ran a fraudulent university and was forced to settle a $25 million class action lawsuit against Trump University.\nTrump lost 38 lawsuits relating to breaking contracts, defamation, and sexual harassment cases.\nTrump became famous for his misogynistic and racist comments about women and racial minorities.\nTrump went on for some time refusing to denounce white supremacist groups and even referred to some white supremacists as “very fine people.”\nTrump hid tax returns and lied about his handling of classified documents determined to have been illegally removed from the White House.\nTrump was ordered to pay $5 million to E. Jean Carroll, the woman he was found liable for sexually assaulting and because of his degrading comments about Carroll was ordered to pay $88.3 million.\nUpon seeing an actress, Trump said, “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”\nTrump said, “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab em by the p***y. You can do anything.”\nTrump once spoke of how attractive his daughter, Ivanka, was and suggested if she were not his daughter he might want to date her.\nTrump is currently facing indictments and an upcoming criminal trial.\nAnd last but not least - Trump cheats at golf!\nThe aforementioned words and actions of Donald Trump do not include all of the blatant examples of Trump’s defiance of his “favorite book.”\nIn America, we all have the right to vote for the candidate of our choice, but this blog is not about voting choices. This blog is about Donald Trump - the man - and how laughable it is that he is selling the Bible and using God to suck money from the weak and gullible.\nBTW: On Amazon.com, the King James version of the Bible is selling for $18.83.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
