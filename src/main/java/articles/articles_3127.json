Hand sanitizers must be available at entrances, and the areas surrounding exam centers are to be kept clean to prevent mosquito breeding.\nThe directive also instructed that mosquito repellents be sprayed inside the centers before exams commence, and seating arrangements be made following health and safety protocols.\nEach exam center is required to have a fully functional medical team and maintain regular contact with local Civil Surgeons or Upazila Health and Family Planning Officers.\nLocal administrations have been asked to run awareness campaigns to ensure compliance with health guidelines and to discourage crowds of guardians near exam venues.",

    "text": "Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO Barry Silbert says the venture capital firm has settled over $1 billion in debt, including the nearly $700 million owed to its bankrupt subsidiary Genesis. In September, Genesis filed a lawsuit to recover around $627 million in loans owed to it by DCG and its affiliate DCG International Investments (DCIG) that matured in May 2023. The parties [struck](https://dailyhodl.com/2023/11/30/digital-currency-group-and-genesis-global-reach-bankruptcy-agreement-court-docs/) an agreement in late November with a repayment schedule that should settle the balance by April 2024. In a new post on the social media platform X, Silbert [says](https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1743391614981046606) DCG has already paid off all the money owed to Genesis. “I’m happy to share that DCG completed a full pay down of the money borrowed from Genesis. We have now repaid over $1 billion of debt, including this ~$700 million, despite the headwinds faced by the industry. I’m excited about the industry’s next chapter and DCG’s leadership role in it.” DCG also issued a statement, [saying](https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1743390858144059536) that the firm has satisfied “all obligations currently due.” Genesis [ran](https://dailyhodl.com/2022/11/16/institutional-crypto-lender-genesis-trading-halts-withdrawals-citing-3ac-and-ftx-collapse/) into troubles in 2022 when crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital went under, causing liquidity issues. The crypto broker’s challenges were further exacerbated by the downfall of FTX, leading the firm to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2023.

    "text": "ITV\nThe latest ITV gameshow sees David Tennant host 11 contestants in a bid to win big money\nTrending on GB News\nITV Genius Game viewers were left switching off from the latest game show, which is hosted by David Tennant, with many claiming it’s “overcomplicated”.\nThe brand-new reality game show sees strategically minded players, chosen not just for their high intellectual prowess but also their social IQ, face the ultimate battle of survival.\nTo win, contestants have to participate in a host of never-before-seen games all designed to not only test their intellectual acumen but also encourage them to carefully and creatively use the art of manipulation to outfox their opponents and win a cash prize.\nDuring the first episode, Tennant guided the eleven players, with exceptional abilities, through a series of mind-bending games.\nThe players needed to work together to be successful, but there could be only one winner.\nIn the first “Main Match”, the players faced Gold Heist, which challenged them to work together if they want to stay in the game.\nDavid Tennant hosts ITV's latest game show\nITV\nIf they won, they would have received a Token of Life and, alongside themselves, got the chance to choose a player to save.\nBut the losing player had to go head-to-head in the ultimate “Death Match”, choosing their opponent from the remaining players.\nThe loser was eliminated from the competition. With the stakes being high and with pressure on, it was a chance for the contestants to show if they would have been able to hold their nerve for the next round.\nHowever, as excited viewers began to tune in and were looking forward to a new gameshow, many were left disappointed and switched off.\nThe 11 contestants all competing for a high prize pot\nITV\nTaking to X, one penned: “#GeniusGame you need to be a genius to watch it. It's like @ITV producers thought 'How can we compete with #bbctraitors'.\n“Brain is completely fried. Totally overcomplicated! Don't think I will continue to watch.”\nSomeone else said: “I feel like I should watch #GeniusGame just in order to prove that it can't be that difficult to understand.\n“But then it's an ITV reality show and I'm not a gormless, braindead f***wit so I just won't.”\nA third raged: “I thought us thick people could just enjoy watching the nerds I never realised we had to BE a genius to enjoy the show.”\nAnother wrote: “How can anybody enjoy this programme if nobody understands how it works? The instructions are completely confusing with no recap whatsoever!\nViewers claimed the new show was trying too hard to be like The Traitors\nBBC\n“It’s like a cheap knock-off of The Traitors! Another poor programme from ITV!”\n“I know I’ve had a few beers but what the actual fuck? If you have to be a genius to even watch it, let alone take part?!?!” a fifth expressed.\nA sixth agreed: “I'm there for reality TV evolving and all that, but not at the expense of compromising entertainment value for overly complicated rules. This feels like hard work.” (sic)",

    "text": "The Vice President, Alhaji Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, is advocating strengthened partnership between the government, the church and other faith-based organisations to propel country's development.\nSuch a partnership, he said, would herald what he described as \"a golden age of collaboration which formally recognises the church and other faith-based organisations as key development partners of the country.\"\nHe explained that, as local development partners, it was imperative that they were motivated through incentives such as tax rebate to do more.\nDr Bawumia, who is also the Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the 2024 election, said this when he addressed the clergy in the Volta Region in Ho, as part of his one day campaign tour to the region.\nAccording to him, his determination to win this year's presidential election was to focus government activities on improving the lives of the people and addressing their critical needs.\nHe assured that the party would not take Ghanaians for granted in developing policies and programmes that improves their living conditions, hence the tour in the region to solicit the views of the people to develop a comprehensive manifesto.\nThe NPP, Dr Bawumia said, was focused on leading Ghana into prosperity while promoting unity through religious tolerance.\nIf elected as president, he said, he would prioritise support for the needy through programmes and policies as well as re-align policies to tackle unemployment by training the youth in digital education.\nDr Bawumia therefore called on the clergy to support him through prayers and counsel.\nThe chairman of the Dr Bawumia Campaign Team, Mr Dan Botwe said the NPP and Dr Bawumia recognise the important role the clergy played in national development and would always ask for their assistance in prayer.\nIn his remarks, the chairman of the Volta Regional Christian Council, Rev. Seth Mawutor, lauded the good policies and programmes of government and prayed that God would help him to attain his wishes.\nRead the original article on Ghanaian Times .",

    "title": "Solar flare on New Year's Eve was largest since 2017: What to know",
    "text": "A powerful burst of energy on New Year's Eve created the largest solar flare that has been detected since 2017.The event may sound serious, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) clarified that the general public had nothing to fear. However, the agency did put out a warning that the flare did pose the threat of temporarily disrupting high-frequency radio signals.NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center also released an image of the flare Sunday, which appeared as a glowing spot on the sun's surface.NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory similarly captured an image of the massive flare, which the space agency colorized in yellow and orange to emphasize the extreme intensity of the heat and ultraviolet light that the flare emitted. Recapping 2023's wild year in space: From UFOs, to commercial spaceflight, and to rogue tomatoes Considered our solar system's largest explosive events , solar flares occur when magnetic energy associated with sunspots is released, creating intense bursts of radiation.Solar flares can last mere minutes, or can drag on for hours, depending on their intensity. NASA classifies solar flares based on their strength, with B-class being the smallest and X-class – which is what was detected Sunday – being the largest.Weaker solar flares won't be noticeable here on Earth, but those with enough energy output to rank as an X-class have the potential to disrupt radio communications, electric power grids and navigation signals. In extreme cases, such powerful flares even pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts, according to NASA.Each letter represents a ten-fold increase in energy output and includes a scale of 1 to 9 in each class. The exception is the X-class since there are flares that have been recorded exceeding 10 times the power of an X-1.The most powerful of those occurred in 2003, when the sensors measuring it overloaded, accoding to NASA. The flare was later estimated to be about an X-45, which could have packed enough of a wallop to create long-lasting radiation storms that harm satellites and even give airline passengers flying near the poles small doses of radiation.X-class flares also have the potential to create global transmission problems and world-wide blackouts, NASA says.Fortunately, Sunday's solar flare didn't come close to that 2003 output.But the flare, rated as an X-5, was the strongest to be observed since Sept. 10, 2017 when an X8.2 flare occurred, according to NOAA.The agency also tied the flare to the same region that produced an X-2.8 flare on Dec. 14 that caused radio blackouts in South America.Solar flares and other solar activity, such as solar storms, are only expected to become more common by 2025 as the Sun reaches the height of its 11-year cycle, known as the solar maximum. The growing activity has brought with it fears of a potential \"internet apocalypse\" if a lengthy outage is triggered. Eric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

    "title": "¡KO al 'Canelo'! Bivol supera a Saúl Álvarez en ranking libra por libra del mundo",
    "text": "¡KO al 'Canelo'! Bivol supera a Saúl Álvarez en ranking libra por libra del mundo El boxeador ruso [Dmitry Bivol](https://www.record.com.mx/box) se ha vuelto a imponer al mexicano [Saúl Álvarez](https://www.record.com.mx/box), esta vez no fue en el ring, si no en el ranking libra por libra de Junta de Clasificación Transnacional de Boxeo (TBRB por sus siglas en inglés). Esta junta la conforma un panel de 51 expertos, entre los que se encuentran periodistas profesionales independientes, historiadores especializados en boxeo y registradores de récords de 21 diferentes países. Sin duda, 2023 fue un año histórico para el boxeo, pues hubo grandes peleas y se vieron cosas que nunca se había visto, como un campeón indiscutido en dos diferentes divisiones. Precisamente Terrence Crawford, quien ocupa el lugar número uno del ranking, fue el primer pugilista en la historia en unificar a las cuatro organizaciones más importantes del boxeo en dos categorías. El japonés Naoya Inoue escaló hasta el segundo peldaño luego de igualar lo hecho por Crawford esta misma semana, además, haciéndolo en tiempo récord de 12 meses. [Oleksandr Usyk](https://www.record.com.mx/box) tuvo un impresionante regreso para defender sus coronas de la FIB, OMB y AMB ante Daniel Dubois, que le valió para mantenerse entre los tres primero del ranking de la TBRB. El cuarto lugar fue el que Bivol le arrebató a Canelo luego de que los penalistas le dieran más valor su única victoria lograda en Arabia Saudita ante Lyndon Arthur, que las dos del mexicano ante John Ryder y Jermell Charlo. Saúl fue colocado hasta el quinto escalón. Este ranking es uno de los más prestigiosos, junto con el de ESPN y el de la revista The Ring, aunque estos dos últimos aún mantienen al tapio por encima de Bivol. [TAMBIÉN TE PUEDE INTERESAR.

Desde cuando?\nTaparan el agujero con inmigrantes regularizados de manera temporal, hasta que se harten y se vayan y luego tendrán que regularizar más y así hasta el infinito.\nNingun sentido tiene este sistema.\n1\nK\n16\n#28\npitercio\nEl talento está demostrado precisamente en salir por patas de semejante mierda.\n0\nK\n13\n#27\nencurtido\nLa construcción no tanto como a la hostelería y al sector primario, pero estos 3 sectores se caracterizan por tener las peores condiciones laborales. De toda la vida los que trabajan ahí es porque no han podido encontrar otra cosa.\nAsí que me pregunto a qué se debe, porque no me cuadra que hayan aparecido últimamente cientos de miles de empleos mejor pagados para gente sin estudios. ¿Un pico puntual de construcción?, si es así, pues peor me lo pones porque el que deje lo que esté haciendo para meterse en la obra probablemente en unos años será un parado a reciclarse como ocurrió en la burbuja inmobiliaria.\n0\nK\n7\n#9\ndanifart\nclaro claro, o quizas en vez de esclavos son simples vagos que no quieren hacer nada que no sea estar 7.5 horas comodamente sentados en una silla, delante de un pc\n0\nK\n6\n#23\nveratus_62d669b4227f8\n#9\nPues claro!. Porque pudiendo elegir entre ganarte un suelto trabajando 7.5 horas sentado delante de un pc o un sueldo 100 o 200 euros superior ( en el mejor de los casos si no eres ingeniero informatico o jefe de obra) pasando frio, calor , expuesto a riesgos, jodiéndote la espalda y tragando mierda todos sabemos que elegiriamos lo segundo, porque no somos unos \"vagos”.\n0\nK\n7\nVer toda la conversación (\n31\ncomentarios)\nAutentifícate si deseas escribir\ncomentarios.
