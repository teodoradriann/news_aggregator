    "text": "SPIRITUALITY WITHOUT GOD LEADS TO THIS\nHaving a religion means nothing. Humans must exercise their spirituality and faith in the true God. Understand.\nEvery human carries spirituality within them.\nGod created us like this so that we may be able to seek Him. However, the lack of knowledge leads to suffering, and a Godless spirituality manifests itself in three ways: idolatry, superstition and self-adoration. None of them truly satisfies the soul.

    "text": "- By\n[Imran Zafar](/authors/imran-zafar) - Published: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 05:44 PM (IST)\n- Source:JND\nAmazon is under prosecution in an Indian court for alleged labour law violations at its warehouse near Haryana’s Manesar. The case follows a labour inspection earlier this year that flagged inadequate safety measures and legal non-compliance, according to documents obtained by Al Jazeera through India’s Right to Information (RTI) Act. The Haryana government has filed a case based on the inspection findings, with the next court hearing set for December 10.\nAllegations Of Unsafe Working Conditions\nThe investigation was initiated after reports emerged of an incident in May where workers were allegedly coerced into forgoing breaks, including for water or restroom use, to meet performance targets. The inspection revealed multiple violations, including the absence of protective clothing for female workers near machinery, which is a clear breach of India’s labour laws, reported Al Jazeera.\nAmazon's internal inquiry confirmed that a manager enforced such a pledge as a “motivational exercise,” which the company later described as an “unfortunate and isolated” incident. Disciplinary action was taken, though details remain undisclosed.\nThe inspection report highlighted Amazon's failure to provide necessary safety equipment and to maintain legally mandated records. Workers were also reportedly not issued employment identity cards. The lack of tight-fitting clothing for female workers near moving machinery was deemed a significant safety hazard, potentially leading to serious injuries, the report stated.\nALSO READ: [Kashmiri Pandit Women To Retain Migrant Status Despite Marriage To Non-Migrants: J-K High Court](https://english.jagran.com/india/kashmiri-pandit-women-to-retain-migrant-status-despite-marriage-to-non-migrants-jk-high-court-10204312)\nCourt Proceedings And Amazon's Response\nThe Haryana government submitted the inspection report as evidence to a Gurugram court, which summoned Amazon to appear on October 28. The hearing was adjourned and the case will resume on December 10. Amazon, in response to inquiries, stated that it had not received a copy of the inspection report and could not comment on the court proceedings, citing the case’s sub-judice status.\nWorker Complaints\nAmazon workers also raised concerns about stringent performance targets and constant surveillance. One worker, identified as Supriya, stated they are expected to stow 150 items per hour, adding that missing the target invites negative feedback. The monitoring includes tracking every minute spent on work or breaks, increasing stress levels.\nALSO READ: [Punjab: Farmer Groups To Hold Foot March Towards Delhi On December 6 For Legal Guarantee On MSP](https://english.jagran.com/india/punjab-farmer-groups-to-hold-foot-march-towards-delhi-on-december-6-for-legal-guarantee-on-msp-10204304)\nBroader Scrutiny Of Amazon's Labour Practices\nGlobally, Amazon’s labour practices have come under intense scrutiny, with workers in the US and UK voicing similar grievances. A survey by the Amazon India Workers Association and UNI Global Union found that over 80 per cent of warehouse workers in India struggled to meet the company’s targets. Amazon dismissed the survey as “factually incorrect.”",

    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. ( KCTV /Gray News) – Multiple families are searching for answers after three men were mysteriously found dead in the backyard of another friend’s home in Kansas City after watching a Chiefs game together.\nThe three men who died have been identified as Ricky Johnson, 38; Clayton McGeeney, 36; and David Harrington, 37.\nThe three men were at the rental home of a fourth friend, Jordan Willis. A fifth unidentified friend was also there, officials said.\nKCTV reports that the friends gathered at Willis’ rental home on Jan. 7 to watch the Kansas City Chiefs game together.\nTwo days later, the bodies of Johnson, McGeeney and Harrington were found in the backyard.\n(From left to right): The three men who died have been identified as David Harrington, 37; Ricky Johnson, 38; and Clayton McGeeney, 36. (GoFundMe) Officers responded to the home that night after receiving a call from McGeeney’s fiancée.\nShe told police she went to the house looking for McGeeney. When no one answered the door, she broke into the basement of the home to look for him.\nDuring her search, she told police she found the three bodies in the backyard and called 911.\nThe Kansas City Police Department said detectives are still waiting on results from the medical examiner’s office to determine causes of death.\nHowever, they said there were no obvious signs of foul play.\nBut the men’s families said things just aren’t adding up.\nJordan Willis’ attorney John Picerno told KCTV that his client had “absolutely nothing to do with the deaths of his three friends.”\nPicerno said the men have all been friends since high school, and that Willis is grieving their deaths.\nWillis has since moved out of the home where the deaths occurred.\n“He’s grieving, he’s had to move out of his home, he’s had to shut down his social media, he’s taking leave of absence from his job, so it’s really affected him,” Picerno said.\nPicerno said the unidentified fifth friend left the home after the Chiefs game around 1 a.m. Then, he said, Willis decided to go to bed around 2 a.m. on the couch.\n“Then in the early morning hours, around 2 a.m., [Willis] believes, he got sleepy and said, ‘I’m going to crash on the couch,’” Picerno said. “He said goodbye to his buddies, and he thought that they left out the front door.”\nPicerno said that was the last time Willis saw his friends, and he was unaware their bodies were in his backyard for nearly two days until police responded to the home after McGeeney’s fiancée found them.\n“… He didn’t know anything about them being in his backyard until police knocked on the door Tuesday evening at approximately 10 p.m.,” Picerno said.\nWhen Picerno was asked why Willis didn’t go outside for two days, he said, “[Willis] had no reason to go out into the backyard, and he didn’t know anyone was in the backyard.”\nAdriana Juarez (right), who shares a child with Johnson, told KCTV things aren’t adding up. (KCTV5) Adriana Juarez, who shares a child with Johnson, told KCTV that things aren’t adding up.\n“None of the stories are adding up about what [Willis] is saying. How do you not know there are three dead bodies on the back porch?” Juarez said.\nThe case has gained national attention on social media, leaving many people wondering what happened. But Picerno remains adamant that his client is just as confused about the deaths as everyone else.\n“He doesn’t have any suspicions about how they died any more than you or I do, or, unfortunately, the families who are grieving over the loss of their loved ones,” Picerno said.\nHe continued, “Jordan [Willis] had absolutely nothing to do with their deaths. He does not know the timing or manner of their deaths, nor does he know how or when they exited his house. He had no knowledge that they remained in his backyard or that they needed medical attention. Had he known, he certainly would have called for help. The last time he saw them was when they left his house, and he went to bed.”\nFamily members are pushing for answers, and they say they hope the attention the case is getting will get them closer to knowing what happened.\n“I never thought it would get as much attention as it has, but I’m hoping with the attention that it will get us closer to getting answers,” said Johnson’s niece, Stephanie Walling.\nAlan McGeeney, Clayton McGeeney’s cousin, told KCTV his family is shocked, confused, and beyond devastated because of his death.\n“100% I think the situation is strange,” Alan McGeeney said. “It just hasn’t really set in; I don’t think it will.”\nHe added, “I’m not looking for anyone’s head or anything, but my cousin was frozen to the dirt for two days.”\nPicerno said Willis allowed officers to search his home when they arrived Tuesday night.\nHe also said that family members of the men did try to contact Willis when the men never came home after the Chiefs game.\nPicerno explained , in part, “Two people came to his house; however, he did not hear them as he sleeps with air buds and a loud fan. One of those people, the wife of one of the deceased, tried to reach him via Facebook messenger. Unfortunately, he did not see this message until after the police contacted him. Two of his friends parked their cars on the street, and there were no cars parked in his driveway. Jordan did not notice the cars in the street.”\nGoFundMe pages have been set up for all three of the men.\nMcGeeney’s fundraiser says his fiancée, who found the bodies, is left with the cost of a funeral and now must transition to a single-income household.\nJohnson’s fundraiser says he was “an adored father to his three beautiful daughters, but also a cherished son, brother, uncle, and friend.”\nHarrington’s fundraiser , set up by his mother, says “I now have to put my son to rest. This was something we did not expect as no parent ever does.”\nPolice said the investigation is ongoing, and the medical examiner has not yet announced the causes of death.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.

The use of coal and firewood, including tandoors in hotels, restaurants, and open eateries, continues to be prohibited.\nNoting that the AQI level in the National Capital Region (NCR) did not cross 300 in the last four days, the top court told the CAQM that stage-3 curbs would be introduced if AQI crossed the 350 mark and stage-4 curbs if AQI crossed 400.\nDelhiites breathed cleaner air for the second consecutive day on Thursday as the AQI was recorded in the \"moderate\" category with a reading of 165.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\n[Open in app](https://www.lokmattimes.com/install_app.htm?utm_source=www.lokmattimes.com&utm_medium=open_in_app&launch_url=https://www.lokmattimes.com/national/schools-in-delhi-to-resume-physical-classes-as-supreme-court-eases-anti-pollution-measures/)",

    "title": "Maine's Democrat Governor Janet Mills is branded a LIAR by the National Weather Service after she claimed they didn't warn her historic storm would bring up to six inches of rain | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Maine 's Democrat Governor Janet Mills has been branded a liar by the National Weather Service after claiming its forecasters didn't warn her about a historic storm. The esteemed federal agency lashed Mills after she was slammed for failing to adequately warn locals that up to half a foot of rain would fall on December 18, causing huge floods and leaving 400,000 without power. Mills put her foot in it last Wednesday while touring flood-battered Kennebec County, saying: 'The National Weather Service did not predict five or six inches of rain in any community in Maine.' But a NWS spokesman said the 75 year-old lawmaker was talking nonsense, insisting state and local officials had been briefed about the impending inundation on December 15. And on Sunday the 17th - the day before the storm - the weather service met with state officials to further brief them on expected flooding, winds, and impact to the state's coast line. Governor Janet Mills is catching flack for saying the National Weather Service did not adequately predict the severe dimensions of the winter storm that hit Maine last week Cars are flooded in a parking lot at the Hathaway Creative Center alongside the Kennebec River, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023, in Waterville, Maine Mills and her office have not yet responded to the NWS's claims that she is a liar. Images of the storm's aftermath show cars hanging off extremely damaged roads, intense, murky floodwaters that swept other vehicles away, collapsed construction sites, and downed trees and powerlines. The storm, which Mills called 'an extraordinary event,' barreled into the Northeast on Monday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people, forcing flight cancellations, and killing at least four people. Wind gusts reaches nearly 70 miles per hour, which Mills also said the National Weather Service did not predict. 'The National Weather Service did not predict 68-70 mile an hour winds in any area of Maine,' she said. 'It was an extraordinary event.' In fact, the NWS does seem to have predicted possible winds of 65-70 miles per hour at the same time that they predicted four-to-six inches of rain. Earlier this week, Mills announced the launch of an online resource for Maine residents who were hit hard by the flood and other storm damage. The Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub was launched on Tuesday. According to the governor's office, it will aggregate 'information, resources, and assistance' for those impacted by the storm.

The severity of the storm's damage prompted Mills to request a Major Disaster Declaration from President Joe Biden, which will allow federal resources to supplement the recovery efforts led by the state. 'In the wake of last week’s storm, my Administration has launched the Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub to help Maine people with questions they may have about property damage, road safety, tree removal, and more,' Mills said in the news release about the resource hub. 'We will update this website as more information becomes available as part of our effort to do all we can to support the swiftest possible recovery of Maine communities.' The governor also announced Tuesday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved the Maine Emergency Management Agency's request to begin an preliminary damage assessment, which is the first formal step toward request the aforementioned Major Disaster Declaration.",

    "title": "El Barça vence con calma al Athletic y optará a ganar su décima Copa de la Reina",
    "text": "MADRID, 14 Mar. (EUROPA PRESS) - El FC Barcelona Femení ganó este jueves por 2-1 al Athletic Club, con un gol y una asistencia de Mariona Caldentey, y se clasificó para la final de la Copa de la Reina, instancia donde optará a conquistar su décimo trofeo ante la Real Sociedad, vencedor de la otra semifinal. Después de un par de acercamientos amenazantes a la portería de las 'leonas', Caldentey acertó a batir a Mariasun Quiñones en el minuto 19. Un fallo de Nerea Nevado en un pase hacia atrás fue aprovechado por la '9' del Barça para pisar área y disparar ante el marcaje de Maddi Torre. Aunque Quiñones repelió el primer tiro, Caldentey remató por segunda vez en su rechace y anotó junto a un poste. Pese a encajar ese tanto y pese al 0-3 del encuentro de ida en San Mamés, las bilbaínas siguieron buscando el gol del honor, especialmente después del descanso. En el minuto 63, un error de la zaguera Ingrid Engen propició que Marta Sanadri robase el balón dentro del área culé y asistiera a Clara Pinedo, que marcó un golazo con la diestra. El empeño visitante casi tuvo mayor recompensa en el 67', con un cabezazo al larguero en un córner y que precedió a otro muy peligroso de la propia Sanadri a bocajarro. La guardameta blaugrana, Sandra Paños, estuvo rauda para atajar ese balón y evitar el 1-2 en el Estadi Johan Cruyff. De hecho, quien sí logró un segundo tanto fue el equipo local en el minuto 72, por obra de Patri Guijarro a raíz de un par de rechaces en un saque de esquina, seguidos por una asistencia con la cabeza de Caldentey. Con una volea de derechas cerca del área pequeña, Guijarro anotó el gol de la calma para un Barça que va lanzado hacia otro triplete nacional. Las pupilas de Jonatan Giráldez ya ganaron la Supercopa de España el pasado 20 de enero, exhibición incluida en la final (7-0 al Levante), y van destacadísimas en el liderato de la Liga F.",
