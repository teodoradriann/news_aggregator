Speaking during ‘The Morning Brief’, a Channels Television programme on Thursday, Osodeke said most governors duplicate universities in their states to get a “piece of the pie” from the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund). “Any governor today establishing a university is eyeing TETFund as a source of funding,” the ASUU president said. “TETFund was created as an intervention fund, not the major funding. The universities belong to the federal government, and the government is supposed to fund them, while states are supposed to fund their own.” Advertisement “It is an intervention fund, but there are people who want to have access to that money from the political circle, from the bureaucratic circle, at all costs. We are struggling with that.” The ASUU president said a structure should be created to carry stakeholders along on how the fund is allocated and spent to enhance transparency. “There should be a stakeholders’ meeting to assess what you want to do with the funds,” he added.

    "title": "Brain inflammation may be the reason behind muscle fatigue after infection and injury - Japan Today",
    "text": "Infectious or chronic diseases such as long COVID, Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury can cause inflammation in the brain, or neuroinflammation, that weakens muscles. While scientists are aware of this link between inflammation and muscle weakness, the molecules and processes involved have been unclear.\nIn our research, our team of neuroscientists and biologists uncovered the hidden conversation between the brain and muscles that triggers muscle fatigue, and potential ways to treat it.\nNeuroinflammation and muscle fatigue\nNeuroinflammation results when your central nervous system – the brain and spine – activates its own immune system to protect itself against infection, toxins, neurodegeneration and traumatic injury. Neuroinflammatory reactions primarily occur in the brain. But for unknown reasons, patients also experience many symptoms outside the central nervous system, such as debilitating fatigue and muscle pain.\nTo solve this puzzle, we studied brain inflammation in the context of three different diseases: bacterial infection in E. coli-induced meningitis; viral infection in COVID-19; and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease. Then, we analyzed how these immune changes affect muscle performance.\nWe measured immune changes in the brains of fruit flies and mice infected with live bacteria, viral proteins or neurotoxic proteins. After the initial accumulation of toxic molecules in the brain that commonly increase in response to stresses such as infection, the brain produces high levels of cytokines – chemicals that activate the immune system – that are released into the body. When these cytokines travel to muscles, they activate a series of chemical reactions that disrupts the ability of the powerhouse of cells – mitochondria – to produce energy.\nThough the result of these immune changes doesn’t seem to damage muscle fibers, it does cause fatigue. When we measured the muscle performance of these animals after giving them treatments to offset the effects of immune activation, we found that both flies and mice moved significantly less in response to manual or mechanical stimuli compared with those that were not infected. This indicated that the animals had reduced endurance.\nConversations between brain and muscle\nOur findings suggest that the muscle fatigue that results from infection or chronic illness is caused by a brain-to-muscle communication pathway that depletes energy in muscles without disrupting their structure or integrity. Unlike traditional explanations for muscle dysfunction that focus on causes outside the brain, such as damage to the muscle fibers, this pathway directly causes fatigue.\nSince the key cytokine involved in brain-to-muscle communication has been preserved throughout evolution across different species, we believe this signaling pathway could represent a universal mechanism the brain uses to claim and reallocate energy to fight against infection.\nSince we studied the brain-muscle axis only in the context of simplified models, we don’t know whether it applies to more complex conditions such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. We also don’t know how impaired energy production in muscles correlates with impaired energy production in the brain.\nFurthermore, the brain-muscle axis works through a series of interconnected steps. But the precise mechanism of this communication and the potential involvement of other cytokines are unknown.\nMuscle fatigue common across disease\nMuscle weakness and fatigue are common symptoms in multiple diseases, ranging from bacterial and viral infections to chronic disorders and neurodegenerative conditions. These symptoms are distressing and reduce the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.\nFor instance, most of the 65 million people around the world struggling with long COVID experience disabling fatigue lasting from months to years.\nSimilarly, reduced muscle strength is a common symptom of early stage Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that affects at least 50 million people globally.\nBetter understanding of how neuroinflammation causes muscle fatigue can lead to potential treatments that improve muscle function.\nNew treatments on the horizon\nOur work suggests that targeting the brain-muscle axis could offer new treatment strategies for muscle fatigue.\nCurrently, we are testing neutralizing antibodies – proteins that bind to and inhibit the function of cytokines – in mice with neuroinflammation. These FDA-approved treatments specifically target cytokines secreted by the brain and prevent signaling to muscle. We are interested in identifying which neutralizing antibodies, or combinations of antibodies, prevent muscle fatigue in mice.\nWe are also planning a long COVID clinical trial to profile cytokine levels in patients. It is unclear whether other COVID-19 proteins can also trigger neuroinflammation and muscle fatigue. Recent evidence suggests that long COVID may be linked to lingering viral particles in several organs, including the brain, even months after infection. However, it is uncertain whether and how this might be connected with the high levels of cytokines seen in long COVID.\nWith further development, targeting the brain-muscle axis could be a useful treatment for people suffering with long COVID and other diseases that cause brain inflammation.\nDiego E Rincon-Limas is Associate Professor of Neurology, University of Florida.

    "text": "Fight climate change – become an electrician! Australia has to massively ramp up the number of electricians we have within 6 years, and retrain some of the ones we already have, if we're going to electrify everything. When Michael Wright meets young people who are passionate about climate action, he advises them to “get some pliers, put on some hi vis, and get an electrical apprenticeship – you'll be fighting climate change every day of your life.” “Every time a sparkie walks out of a house, they're leaving it more energy efficient than when they walked in,” says Wright. “This is how we fight climate change.” Michael Wright is the National Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, so it’s not surprising he’s passionate about the role of electrification in Australia’s renewable energy transition. “We can skill up the next generation of young Australians, the next generation of our country, to build the future we need.” But in an interview with the SwitchedOn podcast, Wright was also blunt about the current lack of electrical skills and the training Australia will need for our electrification journey. “With the amount of work that's coming down the pipeline, both in household electrification, business electrification, heavy industry, retrofit, and then also the broader renewables build out, we have something of a problem.” Currently Australia has about 170,000 sparkies. Jobs and Skills Australia estimates we will need an extra 35,000 electricians by 2030, and on top of that we’ll need another whopping 80,000 by 2050. Wright fears that if we don't have enough electricians to do all the work that’s needed, it will get done anyway, and the chances of dodgy wiring, poorly installed appliances, and tragic consequences, are high. And if we can’t plug the gap, Wright believes the shortage will be felt most in the residential space. “The real fear is that there will be a great sucking sound of electricians moving out of the residential sector and into the more highly paid commercial construction infrastructure projects, which then puts households at risk.” But Wright says this is a good problem to have. “It's actually a massive opportunity for our country. But we do need to be taking some pretty big steps to make sure we've got the people to get this done.” Australia currently faces several challenges in training up all the new electricians we’re going to need. Electrical traineeships are a combination of on-the-job apprenticeships and vocational education, but for the last 20 years, vocational education has been the poor cousin of higher education. Wright says the opportunities to train people in everything that’s needed for the energy transition – from battery systems through to transmission – just don't exist yet. “Most apprentices are getting trained in how to install a landline, instead of getting trained in how to install a battery system, or solar system.” To take just one example, as of mid 2023 Australia had only 34 apprentice transmission workers in training. This is the workforce that is supposed to wire 12,000 kilometres of transmission lines around the country. “We were going to get one to come to a conference,” says Wright, “but then realised we'd be taking 3% of the trainee workforce off the job.” Wright says we have to broaden out who does electrical apprenticeships. “Electrical apprentices are done by 17 to 18 year old boys who have family, or family connections to a trade. So in the US, they call it the FBI – you need to have a Father, Brother, or in-law [in trades.]” If your parents went to uni, it's unlikely you'll be encouraged to do a trade. Given 98% of the electrical trade is male, and only 2% female, the most obvious demographic to target is women. “Making our workplaces more attractive to women also makes them better workplaces in general,” says Wright. “What we're going through is an industrial revolution. We are changing what is powering our society. It would be weird if we didn't have cultural change in that process as well.” Australia also needs to rapidly ramp up refresher training for electricians already working in the industry. “If an electrician did an apprenticeship in the 1980s they probably didn't learn much about Tesla Powerwalls,” says Wright. “They didn't learn anything about solar.” Only 58% of electrical apprentices currently finish their apprenticeship. There are several reasons why but Wright says the current cost of living is a big problem for 1st and 2nd year apprentices who aren’t paid well. He knows apprentices who couldn’t get to work because they couldn’t afford petrol for their car. “Everyone who falls out might as well have never started. We need to be maximising the people already in the system, whilst expanding the overall capacity as well.” Wright argues that although we have to ramp up the number of electricians fast, the potential for electrification to be weaponised as a “pink batts Mark 2” is high, if we get it wrong. “We operate in a stupidly politicised environment where for some reason this has got into left and right, whereas I'm pretty sure electricity is just positive and negative,” jokes Wright. “My greatest fear is, if anything will stop this transition dead, particularly household electrification, it would be a spate of house fires.” The potential for electrification to become weaponised means we need a high level of confidence in the people doing the electrical work. That means better accreditation for workers and standards for electrical appliances. “The solar roll rollout in a lot of ways has been a massive success. But there is a high level of non-compliance [of solar panels],” says Wright. “There's been a lot of people with cracked roofing, water ingress and the rest.” The Federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, some housing supply advocates and the property industry, have all called on the Federal Government to open the doors to international electricians and other tradies. But Wright argues we can't rely on the rest of the world to train our workers for this transition because every other country needs more electricians for their own transition. “Anyone who thinks that they can just send a plane to London or Dublin or Manila or Johannesburg and fill them up with trained electrical workers, they're dreaming because those people are already in California. They're already in Germany.” Whilst the timeframes are scary, and the scale of the job is massive, Wright is optimistic that we can fill the gap. “It finally feels as though everyone is pulling in the same direction,” he says. “The amount of goodwill that I find in industry, at the governmental level, whether it's state and territories or the federal government, gives me a lot of heart.” “I do have a lot of confidence. I do have a lot of passion in this space, but it is a big job. And we just need to go at it as hard as we can.” You can hear the full interview with Michael Wright on the SwitchedOn podcast [here](https://soundcloud.com/switchedon-452047666/fight-climate-change-become-an-electrician?si=66f5c9c08d054164ae91ad5963d90257&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing).

    "title": "Vertiv (VRT) Q2 Revenue Jumps 35%",
    "text": "Vertiv (NYSE:VRT) delivered record GAAP revenue of $2,638 million in Q2 2025, up 35.1 % year over year and beat expectations by 12.1% (GAAP).\nAdjusted earnings per share rose 42% year-over-year in Q2 2025 to $0.95, outpacing analyst estimates by $0.12 (non-GAAP).\nStrong orders growth and a record $8.5 billion backlog as of Q2 2025 supported a raised full-year outlook, despite temporary margin pressure from tariffs and supply chain costs.\nVertiv (NYSE:VRT), a global supplier of critical digital infrastructure and services for data centers and communication networks, released its second quarter results on July 30, 2025. The release detailed record GAAP revenue gains and a significant beat on non-GAAP earnings expectations. Revenue (GAAP) reached $2,638 million, compared to the analyst consensus of $2,353.9 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.95, outpacing the $0.83 consensus. This performance was driven by surging demand for data center solutions, particularly in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. Despite impressive sales and profit growth, higher supply chain and tariff-related costs pressured adjusted operating margins. Overall, the quarter showcased Vertiv's strong market traction and its ability to capitalize on accelerating trends in the digital infrastructure space.\nMetric | Q2 2025 | Q2 2025 Estimate | Q2 2024 | Y/Y Change |\n---|---|---|---|---|\nEPS (Non-GAAP) | $0.95 | $0.83 | $0.67 | 41.8 % |\nRevenue (GAAP) | $2,638 million | $2,353.9 million | $1,952.8 million | 35.1 % |\nAdjusted Operating Profit | $489.3 million | $381.8 million | 28.1 % | |\nAdjusted Operating Margin | 18.5 % | 19.6 % | (1.1) pp | |\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow | $277 million | $336.5 million | (17.7 %) |\nVertiv provides foundational technologies for digital infrastructure. Its portfolio includes power management products, thermal management systems, racks, enclosures, and remote monitoring solutions. These products are essential for data centers, communication networks, and key industrial applications where uptime and performance are critical.\nThe company’s recent strategic focus includes expanding its product innovation—especially in areas needed for artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud deployments—while investing in its global supply chain and manufacturing footprint. By strengthening relationships with large data center operators and technology leaders, Vertiv positions itself as a go-to partner for reliable infrastructure. Its ability to deliver on a growing backlog and execute on large-scale projects is considered central to its continued success.\nThe period saw Vertiv exceed revenue and earnings expectations, reflecting exceptional demand for its digital infrastructure solutions. Organic orders expanded by roughly 15 % compared to the prior year, and the company’s backlog surged to a record $8.5 billion as of Q2 2025—supported by a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2x. Backlog and order strength signal continued future revenue and underline growing industry reliance on Vertiv as the market for data centers rapidly evolves.\nBy region, the Americas segment led growth with net sales up 42.9% (GAAP), buoyed by robust North American data center investment. Adjusted operating profit in this region increased by 34.9% compared to Q2 2024. Services & spares in the Americas were up 22.9% year-over-year for the three months ended June 30, 2025. However, additional costs from tariffs and supply chain reconfiguration led to some margin compression—adjusted operating margin in the Americas fell by 1.4 percentage points compared to Q2 2024.\nThe Asia Pacific segment also posted substantial gains. Net sales increased 35.1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit in Asia Pacific jumped 83.3%, and adjusted operating margin improved by 2.7 percentage points year over year. While service revenue growth trailed that of product sales, both areas contributed positively.\nIn Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), net sales grew 12.5%. Management noted that EMEA pipelines remain robust and are growing.\nProduct innovation remains a mainstay of Vertiv’s strategy, underlined by high R&D investment and recent collaboration announcements. The company continued to invest in engineering and research for its next-generation AI-optimized infrastructure. Its cooling systems, modular power solutions, and integrated white-space products are designed for demanding applications in hyperscale and AI-driven data centers. Vertiv also announced plans to acquire Great Lakes Data Racks & Cabinets, extending its portfolio in high-density racks and enclosures. This acquisition was not reflected in the current quarter’s guidance and results.\nThough order momentum was strong, the quarter was not without headwinds. Tariff-related expenses and the cost of rapidly shifting the company’s manufacturing footprint to mitigate those tariffs weighed on margins. Management called these pressures temporary, and reiterated a plan including commercial pricing actions and supply chain reconfiguration. According to company leaders, these countermeasures should reduce the impact of tariffs toward the end of the year, but margin pressure persisted for the quarter.\nOn the cash flow front, adjusted free cash flow was $277 million—down 17.7% from the prior year quarter—largely due to working capital investments to support growth. Operating cash flow (GAAP) also declined versus a very strong prior year period. Still, on a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow had increased 24%.\nThe company also did not repurchase shares, choosing instead to retain financial flexibility for future acquisitions and to maintain a conservative balance sheet.\nVertiv raised its financial outlook for FY2025 across most major non-GAAP metrics. For the full year 2025, the company now expects net sales between $9.93 billion and $10.08 billion, organic growth of 23 % to 25 %, adjusted operating profit (non-GAAP) of $1.95 billion to $2.03 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.85. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow (non-GAAP) is $1.375 billion to $1.425 billion. However, management revised its margin outlook downward, with adjusted operating margin (non-GAAP) now forecast between 19.7% and 20.3%, a decrease from earlier targets.\nFor Q3 2025, projections include net sales of $2,510 million to $2,590 million, 20 % to 24 % organic growth, and adjusted EPS between $0.94 and $1.00. Management cautioned that these expectations do not factor in any impacts from proposed tariffs that may take effect after July 28, 2025, as regulatory clarity on additional trade policies is still pending. Vertiv’s large backlog, ongoing tariff mitigation, and continued investment in manufacturing and product development will be central areas for investors to watch in the coming quarters.\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

    "text": "Breathtaking northern lights seen across Ottawa. Here’s what it looked like Posted Oct 11, 2024 11:44:46 AM. Last Updated Oct 11, 2024 01:09:59 PM. A powerful geomagnetic storm caused the northern lights to dance across the nation’s capital on Oct. 10. This resulted in the breathtaking hues of the aurora borealis ending up all over social media. Amateur and professional photographers alike headed out into the crisp night air on Thursday to capture what many never thought they’d see before. The spectacle was seen across the province; as the pink, green and red lights lit up Ottawa communities. According to an [astronomer at Western University](https://kitchener.citynews.ca/2024/10/11/aurora-borealis-lights-up-night-sky-in-waterloo-region/), the increase in auroral activity is thanks to the sun’s natural cycle, which comes together in a period of increased activity about every 11 years. Experts note, the sun’s activity has increased in the past year and is higher than it’s been in more than 20 years.
