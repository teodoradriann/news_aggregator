    "title": "Second pastor at Living Word Church charged with sex crimes | U.S. News",
    "text": "A pastor of Living Word Church in Midland, Michigan, has been charged with committing sex crimes, becoming the second clergyman and third leader from the church to be arrested on such accusations in recent months. Randy Saylor, a 71-year-old associate pastor, was arraigned Wednesday on charges of second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a person younger than 13, and second-degree criminal sexual conduct. His crimes allegedly occurred in 2018. Living Word Church has suspended Saylor from all his duties while the criminal investigation is underway, according to The Roys Report . Living Word Church Administrator William Bailey said in a statement to the Midland Daily News that the congregation was “deeply saddened and concerned” about the situation. “It has come to our attention that Randy Saylor, a member of our pastoral team, is under investigation for allegations of sexual abuse,” Bailey stated. “There are no allegations that the abuse took place at the church or involved the church in any way. We are cooperating fully with law enforcement authorities in their investigation. Randy has been suspended from all duties pending the outcome of the investigation.” Bailey admitted that Saylor’s arrest was “not the first time our church has faced such a situation, and we acknowledge the pain and trauma this causes to those directly affected, as well as our entire community.” In late November of last year, the Rev. James Randolph, a minister with Living Word Church, was charged with multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct, including one that allegedly involved a minor younger than 13. Randolph is the son-in-law of televangelist Mark Barclay, the leader of Mark Barclay Ministries and the founding pastor of Living Word Church. In a statement to [The Christian Post](/news/mark-barclays-son-in-law-accused-of-criminal-sexual-conduct.html) last year, Josh Barclay, Mark Barclay’s son who also works with the ministry, said Randolph was placed on administrative leave \"pending the results of the criminal justice process.\" “We are aware of the arrest of James Randolph, one of our ministers on staff, and the allegations against him,” stated Josh Barclay at the time. “Importantly, the allegations do not involve the church, and the alleged acts did not take place in the church.” Last month, Brandon Saylor, the 44-year-old son of Randy Saylor, who was a former church volunteer and leader, was sentenced to serve up to 15 years in prison on three counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a child younger than 13, reported the Saginaw, Michigan-based WNEM. Brandon Saylor was resentenced earlier this month and required to maintain electronic monitoring for the Sex Offender’s Registration Act for the remainder of his life, according to WNEM.",

    "text": "TORONTO — Manulife Financial Corp. says Katy Boshart will take on the role of CEO at Manulife Bank of Canada starting next week. Boshart comes to the firm from TD Bank, where she most recently led its customer engagement platforms division. Manulife says Boshart, who has more than 30 years of banking experience in both Canada and the U.S., will be the first woman to lead Manulife Bank. Boshart takes on the role at a time when Canada has seen several high-profile departures of women in leadership positions in the financial sector. Rania Llewellyn was suddenly replaced by Éric Provost as CEO of Laurentian Bank of Canada last October, Linda Seymour's position as chief executive of HSBC Canada was eliminated with the bank's takeover by RBC last month and last Friday RBC said that it had terminated CFO Nadine Ahn. Manulife Bank of Canada is one of the country's smaller banks with about $29 billion in assets as of the end of January. This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 11, 2024.

    "text": "南非官员披露，该国有一家国有的家禽企业，因财务陷入困境，没钱供应饲料，导致养殖场内超过35万只鸡，因饥饿而互相噬食，动保福利官员被迫对鸡群实施安乐死，场面令人揪心。据美联社报道，该养殖场属于Daybreak Foods公司，该公司是南非国家资产管理公司Public Investment Corp旗下的一家大型家禽供应商。南非国家防止虐待动物协会（The National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals，简称NSPCA）在一份声明指出，工作人员在抵达该遭遗弃的养鸡场时，场面令人震惊，瘦巴巴的鸡群挤在一起，部分鸡只正在噬食同类，喂食的饲料线已是光秃秃。据报道，由于鸡只死亡数量庞大，且部分鸡只尸体，已被啃食，具体死亡数字难以统计。尽管如此，国家防止虐待动物协会仍成功拯救超过50万只鸡。该协会表示，自他们是在上周三（4月30日）首次接获投报，指北部一处农场陷入危机，陆续发现至少另有五个养殖场内的多个区域，有大量鸡只被遗弃。据报道，由于鸡只体型过小，不符合屠宰场收购标准，Daybreak Foods被拒绝将鸡群送往屠宰。该公司发言人诺克瓦兹·恩贡戈（Nokwazi Ngcongo）向媒体说，公司确实因资金困难导致饲料供应中断，但已经尽最大努力减少动物的痛苦。国家防止虐待动物协会农场动物保护部门经理纳撒尼尔·阿帕尔萨米（Nazareth Appalsamy）透露，从上周三起约75名动物保护人员分批展开安乐死行动，直到本周一（5日）才结束。他形容：“对工作人员来说，这是一次身心极为沉重的任务。”协会也指出，这些鸡已经超过一周未被喂食，当局将根据动物保护法起诉该公司遗弃动物的行为。南非政府表示，当局正与Daybreak Foods公司高层，针对财务困境进行谈判。",
