    "text": "Hattori Racing Enterprises downsized to one full-time truck for the 2023 NASCAR Truck Series season, and it didn’t work out well. Tyler Ankrum failed to make the playoffs again and regressed compared to 2022. Ankrum only had one top-5 finish and six top-10 finishes. The driver of the No. 16 truck shockingly ended up 17th in the point standings.\nAnkrum didn’t have the speed to compete with a best finish of fourth place at Circuit of the Americas, and the second part-time truck had the same fate. Christopher Bell drove the No. 61 truck twice and failed to win. The days of winning at least two races per year between 2018 and 2021 feel long gone as Hattori Racing Enterprises tries to turn it around.\nIn 2024, Ankrum will not return to the organization as he will go full-time with McAnally-Hilgemann Racing. Currently, Hattori Racing Enterprises has no drivers for next season as they search for a competitor to put them back in victory lane. The No. 16 truck is still race-winning equipment, and with the right hire, it could see the same success as two years ago.\nRelated Tyler Ankrum to join McAnally-Hilgemann Racing for 2024 NASCAR season\nFollow Motorsports Wire on Facebook and Twitter !",

    "text": "The Finnish gaming giant, with Waste Creative and in-house production studio This Thing of Ours, create a 60-sec animation that showcases a miniature diorama and a scene from the game brought to life on a 1-meter high cake with help from Emma Jayne Cake Design. Finnish gaming giant Supercell is celebrating 10 years of its mobile game Boom Beach with “#Boomiversary,” a global campaign created by Waste Creative and in-house production studio This Thing of Ours. The campaign, dedicated to the game’s fans “Generation Boom” (a nod to the players that refer to themselves as “boomers”), aims to create an authentic moment which existing and lapsed fans of the game will want to be part of. A 60-second animated film showcases a miniature diorama, with a Boom Beach scene brought to life on a one-meter tall cake. At first glance, the cake looks like a memento of 10 years of player achievements. However, as the sky burns red, and the beach becomes a battleground, its true purpose, and the mastermind behind it are revealed. The spot shows that the cake was created by Dr. T, the nefarious scientist who is the game’s primary antagonist, to celebrate 10 years of player failures. Dr. T is the mastermind behind the cake, appearing perfectly framed behind the burnt wreckage of an HQ that troops have destroyed. To create the cake that features in the spot, Waste teamed up with Emma Jayne Cake Design, who turned the in-game scene into an edible reality, using gelatin for the sea, sugar for the sand and a mixture of chocolate and fondant to form the landscape, including palm trees, shrubs, and rocky textures. The cake’s characters and buildings were first designed in 3D, then 3D printed and carefully painted by hand. The cake creation was placed on a four-meter beach set, with sand-like textures carved out of polystyrene and coated in real sand. The sky was created by lighting a wall with a gradient, while the sea was made using back-lit perspex, with cling film to add texture. To shoot the film Waste collaborated with Clapham Road Studios, using a motion control rig with a variety of lenses to capture every angle. Watch the behind-the-scenes making of the 60-second animated film and the final commercial: Boom Beach is a free massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game for iOS and Android. \"Reaching the 10-year mark is an incredible achievement, and it's all thanks to our passionate and dedicated community of Boom Beach players,” said Supercell game resourcing lead Lasse Seppänen. “To honor their unwavering support, we're thrilled to launch our latest campaign, which celebrates players and invites them to share their commander stories, cherish the past and anticipate the future.” “At Waste, one of our favorite things to do is to create things authentically and in-camera,” added Waste Creative director Alex Robinson. “This was the perfect opportunity to do just that, and it presented us with a plethora of exciting challenges and hurdles. Working alongside so many talented artists and witnessing everything come together on the day of the shoot was truly awesome.” Louie Wood, Midweight Creative, Waste Creative, concluded, “For 10 years, players have tried and failed to depose Dr. T from the Boom Beach archipelago. We at Waste felt there was only one way the charismatic villain would celebrate such a delicious victory. An enormous cake topped with an epic diorama showcasing his continued strategic superiority!\" Source: Waste Creative",

    "text": "Kehlkopfkrebs: Zwei zentrale Risikofaktoren, die vermeidbar sind\nMänner erkranken häufiger an Kehlkopfkrebs, wobei zwei bedeutende Risikofaktoren im Fokus stehen. Frühe Warnsignale sollten nicht unterschätzt werden.\nFrankfurt – In Deutschland erkranken jährlich etwa 3.600 Männer und 500 Frauen an Kehlkopfkrebs, auch Larynxkarzinom genannt. Die Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft gibt an, dass die Betroffenen im Durchschnitt 68 Jahre alt sind, wobei Männer häufiger betroffen sind als Frauen. Tumore entwickeln sich meist im Bereich der Stimmlippen und können bei frühzeitiger Erkennung oft erfolgreich therapiert werden. Zudem sind die beiden Hauptrisikofaktoren vermeidbar und somit das Risiko, an Kehlkopfkrebs zu erkranken, reduzierbar.\nZwei vermeidbare Risikofaktoren begünstigen die Entwicklung von Kehlkopfkrebs\nTabak- und Alkoholkonsum gelten als die Hauptursachen für Kehlkopfkrebs. Der Tabakkonsum steht in direktem Zusammenhang mit der Wahrscheinlichkeit, an dieser Krankheit zu erkranken, wobei sowohl die Intensität als auch die Dauer des Konsums eine Rolle spielen. Dies berichtet die Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft.\nEin weiterer wesentlicher Risikofaktor ist der übermäßige Konsum von Alkohol. Besonders gefährlich wird es, wenn beide Faktoren zusammenkommen. Das Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) weist darauf hin, dass die Kombination aus langjährigem Rauchen und regelmäßigem, starkem Alkoholkonsum besonders schädlich ist.\nKehlkopfkrebs: Weitere Risikofaktoren, die man kennen sollte\nNeben den Hauptursachen gibt es weitere Faktoren, die das Risiko für Kehlkopfkrebs erhöhen können. Berufliche Exposition gegenüber Schadstoffen wie Asbest und schwefelsäurehaltigen Gasen (Aerosolen) zählt dazu, wie netdoktor.de berichtet. Auch bestimmte Virusinfektionen, insbesondere mit humanen Papillomaviren (HPV), können zur Entstehung von Kehlkopfkrebs beitragen, so die Apotheken Umschau.\nKehlkopfkrebs lässt sich jedoch vermeiden. Durch den Verzicht auf Rauchen und die Reduzierung oder den vollständigen Verzicht auf Alkohol können Betroffene ihr persönliches Risiko erheblich senken. Frühe Warnzeichen von Kehlkopfkrebs wie anhaltende Heiserkeit, dauerhaftes Halskratzen, Räusperzwang und chronischer Husten sollten ernst genommen und zeitnah von einem Arzt untersucht werden. Bei rechtzeitiger Diagnose und Behandlung sind die Heilungschancen bei Kehlkopfkrebs deutlich besser als in fortgeschrittenen Stadien. (jbr)",

    "text": "About 200 people gathered in single-digit temperatures Monday on Dayton’s West Side to march to Sinclair Community College in memory of Martin Luther King Jr.Walking along West Third Street, the participants in the march sang songs like, “This Little Light of Mine” and “Happy Birthday” to King. MLK Day marks King’s birthday each year, and this year, the holiday fell on his actual birthday.The march was one of several events in the Dayton region where people braved the low temperatures to honor Martin Luther King Jr.Dayton’s MLK Day organizer Anthony Whitmore thanked the participants at the end of the route and said King used to remind people that everything was a gift from God.“Make this city what it should be,” he said. “Because you are the determiner of what it is.”The march began at the Charles Drew Health Center, 1323 W. Third St., and ended at Sinclair Community College. Dion Greene, a survivor of the 2019 Oregon shooting, released a white turtledove on the downtown side of the Third Street bridge. Angel Martin, president of the Montgomery County chapter of Delta Sigma Theta, a traditionally Black sorority, said the sorority alumni come out to walk in the march each year to remember King.“What we’re founded on is social action,” she said. “We’re here to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King and work together with our community.”Kate Furmanski, part of the Oakwood Inclusion Coalition, said she wanted to be something bigger than herself. She said she hopes people can see that many people can still come together and work together, even in harsh weather.“We can still do hard things together as a community,” she said.Will Smith, Dayton Public Schools’ board president, said he reflected on his family as he walked in the march. His parents both worked to make Dayton better, he said, especially the West side.“When I’m out here, I like to just reflect on where I’ve been, where I’ve come from, and then really just talk to people who are out here to let them know that we all have to be together,” Smith said. “I think that’s just going to move the city forward.”Montgomery County commissioner Deborah A. Lieberman said she has been coming to the march for more than 20 years. She finds it a way to celebrate Dayton.“It’s always such a heartwarming day to reflect on Dr. King and the work we still have to do,” she said.Ali Shakhamandarov, a member of the Ahiska Center, which is a community hub for the Ahiska Turk community in Dayton, said the many members of the center were there to support the MLK movement.Ahiska Turks are an ethnic minority in the country of Georgia with a long history of being displaced and discriminated against.“The reason we are here today is to support civil rights,” Shakhamandarov said.",
