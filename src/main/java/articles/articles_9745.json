    "text": "NEW YORK - The Dow edged to a fresh record on Dec 28 following another sleepy holiday season session as investors get ready to mark big annual gains.\n“The last two months have been truly spectacular,” said Mr Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers. “No institutional investor can afford to be under-invested.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.1 per cent to 37,710.10, notching a second straight all-time closing high. The blue-chip index is up almost 14 per cent so far for all of 2023.\nThe broad-based S&P 500 climbed less than 0.1 per cent to 4,783.35, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was essentially flat at 15,095.14.\nEquities have trended higher since late October as the market has embraced moderating inflation and a strong labor market in the belief the US economy can avoid recession.\nData from the Department of Labour on Dec 28 showed a slight increase in unemployment claims. However, the level remains low by historic standards.\n“My concern right now is that both stocks and bonds have been rallying so aggressively, we really have to think about the scenarios that would allow this to continue,” said Mr Sosnick, who noted that bond market predictions of six interest rate cuts in 2024 implies a weaker economy.\nAmong individual companies, Apple advanced 0.2 per cent after a federal court on Dec 27 suspended a ban on the US sale of its latest watch models.\nA ban on sales of the watch had briefly gone into effect on Dec 26 after US President Joe Biden’s administration opted not to veto a ruling on the device’s patent.\nBoeing dipped 0.7 per cent as the US aviation giant said its 737 Max aircraft should be inspected to check for loose hardware on plane rudder control systems.\nThe inspection only lasts about two hours, but the issue comes on the heels of other manufacturing and production problems that have slowed Max deliveries.

    "text": "Khloe Kardashian recently opened up about a complex and sensitive situation she faced with her ex-boyfriend and the father of her two children, Tristan Thompson, in a new episode of her podcast, “Khloé in Wonder Land.” While talking to her guest and a fellow podcaster, Mel Robbins, she revealed why she decided to let Thompson be present during her firstborn daughter, True’s birth, despite the fact that he cheated on her.\nKhloe Kardashian recalls complex situation with ex Tristan Thompson in podcast In a recent episode of her podcast, “Khloé in Wonder Land” with guest, Mel Robbins, Khloe Kardashian went candid about how she managed to go through the repercussions of her ex-boyfriend Tristan Thompson’s public cheating scandal just two days before she gave birth to her first child, True. The media personality disclosed that her personal experience from her first marriage with Lamar Odom helped her to face the complex situation.\nKhloe Kardashian said, “Well the crazy thing is I would draw back to the feelings I had with Lamar.” She continued, “Lamar was my first husband —where I would say, ‘Okay.’ I knew how to deal with this media scandal.” The media personality further explained, “And I just knew sort of to stay away from the noise, which L.A. has a lot of noise.” “Stayed away from my phone, but I would say the biggest was I had a brand new baby and I definitely isolated,” she added.\nHowever, Khloe Kardashian revealed that she “wasn’t in denial about all the noise.” She “didn’t want to pay attention to it. The star further talked about why she let Tristan Thompson stay during True’s delivery. She said, “And I remember when Tristan had an affair, it was public and I gave birth 48 hours later.” She continued, “And people were like, ‘Do you want him in the hospital room when you’re giving birth?’ And it was my first baby and I said, ‘I do.'”\nKhloe Kardashian disclosed that it was all for the sake of her daughter True. She expressed, “I was thinking for my daughter True.” “I thought of her. I was like, ‘For her memories, I want her to know her dad was in the room,” she further explained.",

Image used for representational purpose. File photo | EPS Express News Service Updated on: 06 Mar 2025, 2:36 am 1 min read\nCopied\nNEW DELHI: The capital witnessed extreme temperature fluctuations over the past week, with sudden shifts between unseasonal warmth and winter-like chill.\nOn February 27, the minimum temperature was arround 20°C, resembling early summer, but by March 5, parts of the city, including Palam, saw temperatures drop below 10°C.\nMeteorologists have attributed this sudden dip to strong westerly winds, reaching speeds of up to 40 km/h, carrying icy air from the snow-covered Himalayas. This cold spell is expected to persist until March 6, after which temperatures will gradually rise again.\nThe city had experienced unusually warm conditions in late February. On February 26, the maximum temperature peaked to 32.4°C, the highest of the season.\nHowever, a western disturbance on February 27 triggered a sharp temperature drop. On March 3, Delhi recorded a minimum of 9.6°C, marking a dramatic 10-degree plunge in just four days.\nDespite chilly nights, daytime temperatures remained quite high, with the mercury reaching 31.1°C the same day. This created an extreme variation of more than 21°C between day and night.\nMarch typically signals the onset of summer in Delhi, and forecasts predict that overall temperatures will remain above normal this year.",

    "title": "It’s Christmas, and England’s Priests Have Had Enough",
    "text": "It’s Christmas, and England’s Priests Have Had Enough\nLONDON — On a blustery December morning, the Rev. Nicky Skipworth is leading her congregation in prayer. But the word of God is not being delivered from the pulpit of the parish church in Harworth, a village outside Doncaster, England. It costs the church 200 pounds, or $255, to heat a midweek service. To save funds, it has been moved to the local sports center.\nMs. Skipworth is grateful to her hosts: Some parts of the church are nearly a thousand years old, and it can get bitterly cold in the winter. But when the Church of England has £10.3 billion in the bank, she wonders why the local community is shouldering the burden. “Instead of pulling people out of the river,” she told me, “what if we could go upstream and find out why they’re falling in?”\nIn Britain today, many people are falling into the river. Poverty is widespread, wages are low and public services are in disarray. But amid this vast social suffering, Britons are fighting back. Strike action, taken by workers from all walks of life, is at levels not seen since Margaret Thatcher was in power. Dispelled for decades, labor unrest is well and truly back. And it’s reached somewhere surprising: the Church of England.\nNot long ago, the idea of clergy members joining a trade union was close to inconceivable. The Church of England, after all, was known as “the Tory Party at prayer.” When faith workers set up a union branch in the 1990s, it was viewed with suspicion. The clergy generally thought it either politically inappropriate or theologically incompatible with one’s employment by God. Weren’t trade unions for workers with blue collars, not clerical collars?\nA lot has changed since then. Now part of Unite, one of Britain’s largest unions, the faith workers branch — predominantly priests but also rabbis and humanist celebrants — is fast approaching 2,000 clerical members, or around 10 percent of the clergy in active ministry. The numbers, in themselves, may not sound like much. But these members have joined from a nontraditional sector without any recruitment push from the union, in a remarkably organic process. The branch runs a help line and supports clergy members in disputes; in June, it submitted its first ever formal pay claim.\nTechnically, clergy members aren’t employees but ecclesiastical officeholders, which means they receive a stipend rather than a salary. The national minimum stipend is currently £26,794, or $34,118 — putting the clergy, according to Sharon Graham, the head of Unite, among “the working poor.” Not everyone receives the minimum. Yet while each of the country’s 42 dioceses — a collection of parishes looked after by a bishop — that make up the Church of England are free to set their own stipend, pay is rarely generous. Averaging not much above the minimum, the paychecks have failed to keep pace with rising energy and food prices.\nAlong with a stipend, clergy members are provided with rent-free church housing. In a country where access to decent housing is scarce, this is a major benefit. But while vicarages might conjure up images of quaint cottages nestled away in a pastoral idyll, church housing is often old, damp, drafty and expensive to heat, with renovations carried out at the mercy of the diocese. “People will say, ‘What a lovely big house,’” Ms. Skipworth told me. “But try affording it.”\nIf clergy members are struggling, then their parishioners are too. Thirteen years of Conservative-led austerity, which have cut public services to the bone, have been compounded by a cost-of-living crisis. The effects are legion: 14.4 million people in poverty, homelessness at record levels and pervasive depression. In this scarified landscape, vicars now find themselves acting more like social workers, helping parishioners with debts, fuel and housing.\nAcross the country, churches are running food delivery services, pay-what-you-can cafes, community shops and assistance programs. Food banks, which in a decade have become a normal feature of British society, rely heavily on churches as hosts, as well as for donations and volunteers. Some churches have opened “warm spaces” — heated rooms for those in need of warmth — and others provide “snuggle boxes,” where donated slippers, blankets, hot water bottles and dressing gowns are redistributed among the community.\nFor faith workers, responsible both spiritually and practically for their congregants, this work takes a big toll. It’s also impossible to escape. “Everybody knows where I live,” Ms. Skipworth said. “The doorbell can go at any time, and I’ll have no idea who’s there. It could be somebody wanting a baptism, somebody in need of help or just somebody who saw the word ‘vicarage’ on the gate.”\nRedundancies, church closings and the merging of parishes have also led to heavier workloads. Especially at this time of year, the demands — running a full liturgical calendar, on top of everything else — can be grueling. “Sometimes it seems that the church is greedy for our time and our energies,” the Rev. James Pitkin, a priest in Hampshire, told me, “but then doesn’t acknowledge the cost.”\nDespite these difficulties, there can be a reluctance among the clergy to talk about their own troubles. Ministry is often seen as a calling rather than a vocation, let alone just a job, and the concept of service underwrites the work. The expectation to embrace a life of sacrifice can make it hard for faith workers to voice demands for themselves. And for some clergy members, being treated poorly isn’t a bad thing — instead, it allows them to better follow in the example of Jesus.\nIn seeing suffering as a condition to organize against rather than a demonstration of one’s own godliness, unionizing clergy members like Ms. Skipworth and Mr. Pitkin, both of whom are active members of the Unite branch, are breaking with tradition. But they are also drawing on a longstanding relationship between Christianity and British trade unionism. Initially, this was a relationship of hostility — the Tolpuddle Martyrs, a group of six farm laborers exiled to Australia in 1834 for forming a trade union whose story is foundational to the British trade union movement, were betrayed by their local vicar.\nOver time, however, that hostility gave way to something more symbiotic. Christian socialism and Methodism contributed practical and ideological resources to trade unionism, offering meeting places and models of organization as well as the egalitarian notion that men and women are created in the image of God. In this way, the trade union movement’s motto that “an injury to one is an injury to all” can be read as a translation of 1 Corinthians 12:26: “If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it.”\nToday, the effort to unionize has created a space for clergy members to see themselves as workers, giving them a way to resist injustice and inequality. “There are those that say, ‘Don’t talk about politics or religion,’” Ms. Skipworth said. “That’s what those in power want to instill in people to stop them challenging the status quo.”\nPolly Smythe (@pollysmythe) is the labor correspondent at Novara Media and a freelance journalist.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "text": "By Matthew Wadleigh ,\n57 minutes ago\nThe Miami Hurricanes got some massive news with Georgia quarterback Carson Beck deciding to enter the transfer portal and come play for Mario Cristobal.\nWith Cam Ward leaving for the NFL, Beck immediately comes into Miami and becomes the QB1 and a big name to watch in 2025. Moreover, the Hurricanes roster looks that much better, although there are still holes to fill if they want to compete for a College Football Playoff spot next season.\nWhile Beck's move sparked plenty of criticism, NFL Draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. is all aboard the decision, as he explained during an of NFL on ESPN alongside Field Yates.\n\"I couldn't be happier,\" Kiper stated while clapping. \"The decisions that players make sometimes will leave you scratching their head, I mean that's why I'm losing my hair...I'm ripping my hair out with decisions that these guys make. When you have time to play college football, I'm begging you, take it.\"\nKiper also mentioned it doesn't matter where players are drafted, but rather how prepared they are for the jump to the NFL.\n\"It doesn't matter where you go, it's how well-prepared you are for what's going to be asked for you to do in the National Football League,\" Kiper continued.\nHe also mentions that they need to play at a \"Consistency high level\" in the NFL, and that's what it's all about at the next level.\nIt's a different approach than many have made with transfers, but Kiper has a valid point. Beck could improve his draft stock and he is already making a ton of money in the reported NIL deal at Miami.\nIf it works out, Beck could be a big name in the 2026 NFL Draft, and he could last much longer in the NFL if he refines his skills this season at Miami.",

    "text": "I remember it slightly differently. As a journalist on pub trade title The Morning Advertiser in the 2000s, the anxiety felt by many pub and bar operators was a constant ahead of the bans in England and Wales in 2007.\nNot unlike now, the pub industry faced multiple challenges in the mid-2000s.\nRising costs – of raw ingredients, utilities, and surging alcohol tax – were eroding profits. New licensing laws added regulatory burdens, while deep discounting of alcohol by supermarkets encouraged at-home drinking (60p for a can of Stella, anyone?)\nMeanwhile, major tenanted pub companies had big debt piles to service. And on high streets, rents had become overheated after a huge expansion of bars and nightclubs in the 1990s. All this was before the recession and consumer spending squeeze brought by the banking crisis.\nIt felt at the time like smoking ban proponents were (no pun intended) gaslighting the industry.\nTypically, the ban’s impact would be undermined by highlighting opportunities to grow trade elsewhere – particularly by adding a food offer, which would encourage a more diverse customer base (read: more women and families, fewer boozing blokes).\nThese trends were indeed in play in the early 2000s, and it was clearly the direction of travel for many pubs and bars.\nBut that was little comfort to those outlets, especially community locals with little or no outside area, that were neither able to invest in a food offer nor to lose many loyal customers literally overnight. To not acknowledge this felt disingenuous at best, deceptive at worst.\nSome of the language was grating, too. I remember one government official correcting my use of the term ‘smoking ban’. No no, it’s the ‘smoke-free legislation’. Well that’s OK, then.\nIn the long term, most pubs adapted and survived. The health benefits of the ban are inarguable too. The majority of the pub industry would agree that life is better post-ban.\nBut let’s not pretend there weren’t victims. Many pubs did close and many livelihoods were ruined.\nResponding to news this week that the government is considering an outdoor smoking ban, UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls issued a strong warning, saying such a move “comes with the prospect of serious economic harm to hospitality venues”.\n“You only have to look back to the significant pub closures we saw after the indoor smoking ban to see the potential impact it could have. This ban would not only affect pubs and nightclubs, but hotels, cafés and restaurants that have all invested significantly in good faith in outdoor spaces and continue to face financial challenges.\n“The government must embark on a full and detailed conversation with affected parties on the impact of such a ban before any legislation is laid. It must also assess whether such a ban would achieve its aims of meaningfully reducing smoking or simply relocate smoking elsewhere, such as in the home.”\nNicholls is right. Communicators making a case for a ban must be honest: spell out the health benefits, but acknowledge that businesses will be hit and lives affected.\nThink also if there is a way to sweeten the pill. The ULEZ scrappage scheme, offering grants to scrap or retrofit vehicles that didn’t meet requirements of the London clean air zones, is a good example.\nAnd clear up uncertainties as soon as possible. Uncertainly was rife in the months and years prior to the indoor ban, with ambiguity over issues such as what type of smoking shelters would be allowed and whether non-food pubs or members clubs would be exempt. These hindered investments and created significant unease.\nOverall, healthcare communicators must think beyond purely healthcare arguments, and put themselves in the shoes of others, if they want an extended smoking ban to be successful for all.\nJohn Harrington is editor of PRWeek UK and former news editor of The Morning Advertiser",
