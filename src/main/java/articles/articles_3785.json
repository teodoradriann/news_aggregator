    "text": "An international group of lawmakers has condemned communist China for using “direct and indirect” coercive measures against those who took part in a recent summit in Taiwan. [summit in Taipei](https://www.theepochtimes.com/china/taiwanese-president-warns-of-chinese-regimes-expanding-authoritarianism-at-ipac-summit-5696479)at the end of July. The event was attended by 49 IPAC members from 24 countries, marking the largest delegation of foreign parliamentary members to visit the self-ruled island. [revealed](https://www.theepochtimes.com/china/ccp-pressures-legislators-from-multiple-countries-to-skip-taiwan-summit-5695515)that Beijing tried to stop IPAC members from traveling to Taiwan through coercion and other acts of interference. Some of those who went to the Taipei summit have since been targeted in their home countries by Chinese authorities. IPAC listed several politicians, which it said were among those who “have been subjected to wholly inappropriate efforts by the PRC to limit their fundamental freedoms, both before, and after the Summit.” [statement](https://www.ipac.global/news/ipac-statement-on-intimidation-of-ipac-lawmakers-by-representatives-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china)on Aug. 6. “The PRC’s coordinated program of political interference and intimidation over recent days, directed specifically against delegates to the IPAC 2024 Summit, is a clumsy and openly coercive series of actions designed to limit engagement and dialogue between democratically elected representatives,” the group added, referring to China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Beijing claims Taiwan as a part of its territory, even though the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has never ruled the island nation. The regime does not tolerate any government officials or foreign diplomats engaging with Taiwanese officials. [12 countries](https://en.mofa.gov.tw/AlliesIndex.aspx?n=1294&sms=1007)—including Haiti, Guatemala, Paraguay, Palau, and Eswatini—recognize Taiwan as a state and have formal diplomatic relationships with it. “Neither the PRC, nor any other country, has the right to threaten foreign lawmakers for having entirely legitimate discussions of international law and global prosperity, nor seek to curb the freedom of movement of democratically elected lawmakers,” IPAC stated. CCP’s CoercionThe Solomon Islands government on July 31 issued a statement [criticizing](https://www.theepochtimes.com/china/ccp-pressures-legislators-from-multiple-countries-to-skip-taiwan-summit-5695515)Peter Kenilorea, a leading opposition member of parliament (MP), for taking part in the summit. The South Pacific nation claimed that the trip was “an attempt to harm the Solomon Islands and the People’s Republic of China relations” and reiterated the CCP’s territorial claim over Taiwan. [statement](https://www.solomonstarnews.com/are-we-free/)published by local newspaper Solomon Star on Aug. 3. “Instead of harming Solomon Islands, the summit looked at ways that we as concerned MPs of the IPAC network can continue to spread the message in our respective Parliaments about perils any unilateral change to the Taiwan strait relations could bring,” he added. [Manasseh Sogavare](https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/solomon-islands-to-get-new-prime-minister-as-pro-china-leader-exits-race-5640412)decided to end the relationship and switched diplomatic ties to China in 2019. [took](https://x.com/KevinVuongMP/status/1820866420890030089)to the X platform to say he stood in solidarity with Kenilorea while sharing a photo of the two parliamentarians. “As democracies, we must #StandTogether against those who would interfere in our freedom of movement & work,” Vuong wrote on Aug. 6. [letter](https://x.com/ipacglobal/status/1819955577570676974)provided by IPAC, the Chinese Embassy named Tenița and wanted the party leadership to “take concrete measures to control the behavior of certain members.” The letter also told the party leadership to “not conduct official exchanges or contacts in any form with Taiwan,” asserting that official interactions “are not in favor of the development of bilateral China-Romania relations.” [statement](https://x.com/catalintenita/status/1820674607466049838)published on the X platform on Aug. 6. “I intend to foster long-term cooperative relationships with municipalities and authorities in Taiwan, particularly in areas such as public service provision and sustainable urban development,” Tenita wrote. “I believe it is in Romania’s interest to establish bilateral trade and cultural representations in Taipei and Bucharest, as well as to enhance conditions for access and conduct of commercial activities,” he added. The CCP’s coercion tactics also reached Sweden. Elisabet Lann, a municipal councilor in Sweden’s city of Gothenburg and a member of the Christian Democrats (KD) party, also participated in the Taipei summit.

    "title": "Professor Rachel Saunders' ART 217 / EAS 217 \"The Arts of Japan\" Investigates Life Stories of Individual Things | Department of Art and Archaeology",
    "text": "Professor Rachel Saunders launched into her new position teaching Japanese Art History this fall, bringing her deep curatorial experience with and knowledge of Japanese art to Princeton’s collection in a special iteration of ART 217 / EAS 217 “The Arts of Japan.”\nThe course explored a broad range of media representing 5000 years of Japanese art history by delving into the life stories of individual things ranging from prehistoric ritual figurines and medieval mandalas or ‘impossible’ Zen paintings and ‘enlivened’ sculpture—to narrative paintings of the world’s oldest novel and sacred architectural sites—to contemporary protest art in Okinawa. The course also covered calligraphy, ink arts, photography, and, with the benefit of Princeton’s own robust collection, printing.\n“Professor Saunders places profound emphasis on the meticulous and sustained observation of artworks, providing an invaluable opportunity to truly learn how to ‘see’ artwork by patiently guiding us to look.\"\n— Yuchen Wang, A&A graduate student\n“For me, it’s been a breath of fresh air to see familiar material with new eyes, and to expand beyond the horizons of the class as originally conceived in response to individual interests and needs,” said Saunders. “In the last few weeks we’ve explored rarely introduced and very recently published work on some challenging topics, thanks to the interests and capacities of the group. They’ve been ready to tackle everything from prehistoric Jōmon archaeology to the ethics of painting in nuclear time.”\nArt & Archaeology senior Henry Moses had minimal experience with Japanese art before the course. “Coming in blind to the course was a bit worrisome,” he said, “However, what has been surprising and wonderful about the course is how we've used the content to think through really important historiographical and theoretical concerns. For example, our discussion of Kristopher Kersey's new book Facing Images: Medieval Japanese Art and the Problem of Modernity allowed us to discuss theoretical topics such as the creation of modernity, art historical recurrences and reverberations, afterlives, and interrogate historiographical topics like periodization and the problem of comparison. The discussion wasn't specific to Japanese art, but extended into our concerns about the discipline of art history in general.”\n“I’ve loved the shared dynamic and rhythm we’ve developed where everyone brings something new to the table at every meeting….For me it’s been very energizing!”\n— Professor Rachel Saunders\nExploring Princeton's collection\nParticipants agreed that seeing a selection of Princeton’s Japanese prints first hand was a highlight of the course.\n“Being able to interrogate a number of ukiyo-e woodblock prints in person really helped me grasp that central medium of Japanese art,” said Moses. “My reception of woodblock prints before the visit had been fairly dematerialized—mostly as images on my computer screen. However, seeing a selection of prints and the tools used to make them in person helped me understand the technical skill and material depth of the art form.”\nA&A graduate student Yuchen Wang agreed, “Close contact with the original piece becomes a conduit for connecting with the artisans across time and space, deepening our appreciation and understanding of their craft.”\nCritical visual analysis allowed the group to detect, in Wang’s words “the subtle traces left by the pressure of the block on the paper and the nuanced glossiness of the ink [which] elude photographic capture.” “As one moves under the light” he continued, “varying angles reveal different facets of the work, offering a dynamic visual experience.”\n“It was fantastic to be able to bring Edo period woodblock prints, rare books, and print-making tools from three different collections on campus together in one space to look very closely for several hours during the week we were covering woodblock printing in Japan. We could follow the entire process from sketch to proof to finished color print through these original works.”\n—Professor Rachel Saunders\nSaunders was thrilled to have Princeton’s collection as a teaching tool. “It was fantastic to be able to bring Edo period woodblock prints, rare books, and print-making tools from three different collections on campus together in one space to look very closely for several hours during the week we were covering woodblock printing in Japan,” she said. “We could follow the entire process from sketch to proof to finished color print through these original works. There’s no replacement for a first-hand understanding of the qualities of mulberry paper that make it so uniquely ideal for woodblock printing, or the depth of the colors or sophistication of textures being achieved in an industrial scale yet still hand-made, production process. This kind of encounter with the demands authentic response on multiple levels, which in turn helps us to re-think why works like these had so much impact when they traveled beyond Japan, and how we might return to them as we intervene in conventional Euro-American narratives of what exactly that impact was.”\nOf particular note in Princeton’s collection was the opportunity for the class to make close comparisons between seemingly similar works. “It was truly wonderful to be able to compare not one, but two editions of one of the most celebrated of all Japanese woodblock printed illustrated books, Gifts of the Ebb Tide (1789), designed by Kitagawa Utamaro (d.1806),” Saunders said. “It’s the most spectacularly seductive book – a fictive trip to the shoreline to collect shells morphs into a poetry competition, with paired poems written for each of the exquisitely illustrated shells collected. The printing of the individual shells arranged over pages of weed-scattered sand is magical – dusted with mica here and there so they shimmer, or blind printed to convey their ridged surfaces, for example. Princeton has a superb early impression, and also a very lively later printing, so we were able to compare the changes made over time as the publisher endeavored to capitalize on its popularity. This is something it’s almost impossible to do without physical juxtaposition, so we are extremely fortunate that the collections facilitate this kind of close and revealing looking, which is almost always best done in a small group since we all notice differently, and differently again when together,” she said. “A rare and happy opportunity!”\nA new way of seeing\nFrom the very outset of the course, Saunders prioritized honing participants’ visual analysis skills to make close, sustained, and repeated observations of objects, and then articulate those observations. “Although it is a fundamental tool of the academic art historian’s tool kit, developing this kind of attention has applications as an ethical, intellectual, and even spiritual practice that you can take into many other areas of life,” said Saunders, promising “It will change the way you see.”\nHer efforts were clearly impactful. “Professor Saunders places profound emphasis on the meticulous and sustained observation of artworks, providing an invaluable opportunity to truly learn how to ‘see’ artwork by patiently guiding us to look. This approach makes us acutely aware of any preconceived assumptions that might obscure our perception of what is present in the images and objects,” said Wang. “Engaging in essential, precise, and succinct visual analysis has illuminated the gaps and assumptions embedded in my own thought processes.”\n\"Discussion is central to Professor Saunders' classes. She is not necessarily looking for a right answer, and is instead invested in creating a space in which her students can test ideas and theories out.\"\n— Henry Moses '25, A&A major\nExploring the topic through discussion was also central to Saunders’ method. “She encourages us to refine and critically assess our arguments during class discussions,” said Wang. “By posing thought-provoking questions, she illuminates the blind spots in our reasoning, thereby deepening our analytical skills—not only in relation to the artworks themselves but also concerning the arguments we construct. Furthermore, she fosters an open-minded and inclusive environment that embraces a spectrum of theories and interpretative perspectives. She guides us through various readings with insight, enhancing our comprehension of the material from multiple angles.” Moses elaborated, “She is not necessarily looking for a right answer, and is instead invested in creating a space in which her students can test ideas and theories out.”\nDiscussions were fruitful for Saunders, too. “I’ve loved the shared dynamic and rhythm we’ve developed where everyone brings something new to the table at every meeting,” said Saunders. “For me it’s been very energizing!”\nIn spring 2025, Professor Saunders is teaching ART 327 / EAS 327 [Handscroll to Anime: Visual Storytelling in Japanese Art](https://artandarchaeology.princeton.edu/whats/courses/handscroll-anime-visual-storytelling-japanese-art) and ART 526 / EAS 566 / REL 540 [Arts of Enlightenment: Buddhist Materialities in East Asia](https://artandarchaeology.princeton.edu/whats/courses/arts-enlightenment-buddhist-materialities-east-asia).",

    "text": "Sri M is a spiritual leader with a difference. Born a Muslim, he chose to embrace sanyasa at a young age. His intervention to put an end to killings in the political fields of Kannur made him familiar to Malayalis. Sri M is a spiritual leader with a difference. (Photo | Express) Express News Service Updated on: 16 Feb 2025, 2:49 am 11 min read\nCopied\nYou are not a conventional spiritual leader. You are married, have conducted padayatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, and have been a mediator when political killings happened. What makes you different from other spiritual leaders?\nWhat you said is one of the factors that makes me distinct (smiles). But there’s a slight correction to saying that I’m not seen as a conventional spiritual person. I have a parampara. My guru was from Nath Sampradaya (Gorakhnath). In Nath Sampradaya, there are married and unmarried persons. My guru asked me to lead a normal life.\nWho is Sri M in reality? A spiritual leader, mystic or a social activist?\nIf you ask that in depth, there is no Sri M, there is only the soul. My birth name was Mumtaz Ali Khan. The first letter starts with M. When I was given deeksha in Nath Sampradaya, a Nath name was needed. So I was called Madhukar Nath. He (guru) used to call me Madhu. That also starts with M. But what makes me happy is that the M in Sri M means manushyan or manav (human being). I am a human being and I am free of all other definitions. Sri was prefixed by someone. Even if you call me M, I’m happy. If I’m addressed as Mr M, I’ll be the boss of James Bond (laughs out).\nIn your autobiography, it is said that you undertook a journey at the age of 19. Why did you have to travel to the Himalayas to seek your spiritual purpose?\nAt the age of nine, my guru placed his hands over my head. It was after that episode that spirituality manifested in me and changed my life. Till the age of 19, I was in Thiruvananthapuram and met a lot of spiritual leaders. But I did not think of accepting any of them as my guru. So, after hearing about gurus and yogis in the Himalayas, I was attracted to go there. I left without informing anyone. I had to face a lot of difficulties. Finally, I found Babaji at Vyasa guha. I was with him for three and a half years.\nWas the journey to meet your guru predestined?\nNo. I don’t encourage the word predestined as it denotes a fatalistic life. There is a blueprint that is predestined. But man has a brain and freedom to work within that blueprint. If there is a blueprint for 10 persons to go towards spirituality, only one person may go. It’s our decision. If not, what’s the use of the brain if everything is predestined?\nSo, isn’t there destiny?\nDestiny means what you make of your life. My statement can render astrologers jobless. But this is my belief.\nPeople say Guru Babaji is still there. Is that true?\nWe call him Sri Guru Babaji in our parampara and not mahavatar. Yes, I believe so. In our parampara we don’t consider him a human being. Any human should die once born. This is a being who was not born from the womb of a mother. He is actually a mayaroopam in our language, a body created for a specific functionality. Whenever he feels the function is complete, he would dissolve it. So he exists even now.\nThere have been many godmen around us. Is Sri M one of them?\nThere will be attempts to make me one but I won’t allow it as there is no need for it (laughs out).\nWhat makes you different from them?\nDo I look like a godman? There are two dangers associated with godmen. One, the personality itself will be full of ego and will start thinking that whatever one says is right. Secondly, one’s personality becomes more important than one’s teachings. This is equally dangerous. I have told people that it is not me but what I say that is important.\nNames like Sri M, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar... aren’t all these a part of making the person godmen?\nNobody is willing to call me M. Sri is actually a short form for Sriman (Mr). It was a royal family in Delhi that first used to call me Mr M. Their niece suggested calling me Sri M and the name stuck. Now it is very useful as it can be used as a pen-name (smiles).\nMost spiritual leaders relinquish their ties with families but you maintain family relations. How is that possible?\nVery difficult (laughs out). It’s a tightrope walk. To maintain a family along with spirituality is very difficult. I was ready to take up sanyasa. But Babaji advised against it. He asked me to get married and experience problems faced by commoners. In my opinion, marriage has the capacity to cut the ego. If one moves to sanyasa without experiencing grihastha, he may later become distracted by some attractions. It is difficult to handle it unless you are exceptional.\nYou were born in a traditional Muslim family. What attracted you to Hinduism?\nRebirth is a theory for many but an experience for me. My life changed when Babaji placed his hand over my head. He didn’t ask me to change. But when I introspected, I liked ancient Hinduism which provides for questioning, probing and accepting. In Upanishads, you can see dialogues. Nobody asks you to believe in something. There is another stream which asks you to believe only in one god. Suppose if I cannot believe it, there is no answer for it. Also, we may feel their arguments are contradictory. Then I thought there should be something else. And I started meeting swamis in the area. I also read spiritual books from the public library. I got attracted to this stream (Hinduism) because, in it, we learn through dialogues. But I haven’t changed my name.\nIs your name still Mumtaz Khan?\nYes. I didn’t feel the need to change it.\nAre you saying that you were attracted by the freedom in the Hindu religion?\nYes. But that is my fear as well. If Hinduism is Talibanised, the world would be destroyed. There is a possibility for that.\nHow do you view casteism? Isn’t casteism the big bane of Hinduism?\nYes. Casteism developed much later in Hinduism. Who authored Brahmasutra and Mahabharata? It was Veda Vyasa, whose mother was a fisherwoman. One should be judged by his life not by birth. Today, there are many Brahmins whose lifestyle is worse than anyone else (smiles).\nBut Mahabharata is full of caste references…\nYes, there are caste references in the Mahabharata, but it was the social norm at the time. However, it is no longer necessary. When people achieve success in a certain field, they often try to pass it on to the next generation, which can lead to a system resembling caste. This happens in many areas, even business. Brahmins were universally respected. So they tried to perpetuate their position, making it hereditary instead of focusing on qualities. The varnashrama system, however, was originally based on qualities.\nEven when you say this, a Dalit cannot be a priest in Sabarimala...\nIt’s a difficult issue to address, and ideally, the criteria should be based on quality, not birth. I don’t deny the role of genetic factors, but I believe that I may be more qualified than some Brahmins despite being outside the traditional hierarchy.\nDo you foresee a possibility of an India without caste?\nIf the caste system ever ceases to exist in India, then it will become a true ‘Hindu Rashtra’. When I talk about Hindu, don’t think of it as a political statement about a ‘Hindu Rashtra’. It’s about understanding the essence of Hindu teachings. My definition of Hindu is a Sanatani definition.\nYour arguments seem contradictory when you say that some people are qualified for something...\nThere’s no contradiction. People qualify themselves by practising and learning at home. They know the requirements and what needs to be done. It’s difficult to train someone from outside the system because they haven’t been exposed to it from a young age.\nYou once said Marxist ideology would have been different had Karl Marx read the Upanishads. What exactly did you mean?\nMarx’s Das Kapital has no spiritual aspect, it is strictly economic. Had Marx read the Upanishads, there would have been a spiritual element in his philosophy. The dialectical aspect is fine, but it should not be reduced to materialism alone.\nHow do you see the equation of Marxist leaders and yoga?\nSome time ago, Marxist leaders approached me with a request to teach their cadre yoga. But they didn’t want to associate with orthodox centres. Yoga, as a practice, can be done even without being a believer. I agreed to teach them. They named the approach Chethana Yogam, and some of the cadre started practising it. About 1,000 volunteers even demonstrated their practice at an event in Kannur.\nWhat’s the difference between Communist yoga and normal yoga?\nNo difference (laughs). The probable difference is they wouldn’t say any chants of Ganesha or other deities before the commencement of the yoga. They would just do it. Some practices require the chant of om. They asked me if it was necessary. I told them if it’s difficult to chant om, they need to just say instead (laughs out). There are many who do it.\nHas CM Pinarayi Vijayan shown interest in learning yoga?\nI can’t comment on that (smiles).\nSwami Vivekananda called Hinduism the mother of all religions. From what you say, Hinduism has different streams of thought. How much of a common ground or source do you feel all religions have? Islam speaks about formless God and Hinduism also has nirakara sankalpa?\nThere is a correction. The Allah that Islam speaks of and the Parabrahma in Vedanta are not one and the same. There is a conceptual difference. In my opinion, Swami Vivekananda must have used the word ‘religion’ as a general term, and not as a specific term. Second, Swamiji appreciated all schools of thought. Jains may or may not admit they are Hindus but they are also part of the whole structure. Buddhism may seem different, but basically, it is the same stream. These things are all rooted in ancient wisdom or teachings.\nWhy do you say Allah is different?\nBecause the concept is different. I have studied both. Allah is formless (nirakara) but is not without attributes (nirguna). Formless Allah gets angry and all. It is contradictory, but that is the concept. It is not Advaita although people think Allah is the only God, which means it is Advaitic. Allah is defined as a concept which is the only truth and nothing else is true. But Advaita is a concept which says everything is rooted in the same truth.\nIn Advaita, according to Adi Shankara, the Supreme Brahman is the only truth. That truth you cannot contact, you cannot pray to it, you cannot worship it, and it does not have any attributes (nirguna). It has no personal qualities... nothing you can do to it. When you quieten your mind totally, when all ripples of thought cease fully, what remains is the Brahman. That concept and the concept of Allah is very different.\nIn the science vs spirituality debate, science is logic and spirituality is faith. How can a person with a scientific mind be spiritual?\nBecause spirituality is not non-scientific, and religion may appear to be based on faith. There are many things that the ordinary brain, in its present capacity, can explore. The most intelligent person quickly realises the limitations of so-called ordinary thinking. There are other modes of thoughts and experiences that are outside the systemic thoughts and experiences we have built up. The most intelligent person should understand the limitations of psuedoscientific thought and then go beyond it.\nCan spirituality and science go together?\nIt should go together. There was a time it was moving together, and that has to come back.. And we need to be careful about pseudoscience.\nYou have spoken about a particular verse in your book and also about naga loka. You claim to have met the naga. How does this relate to science?\nThe only reason is science too has a prejudice. They are not ready to accept something which is beyond what they have defined as science. The definition of science has to be changed, just as our understanding of humanity, religion and spirituality must change with time.\nSome say your autobiography reads like a fantasy novel…\nYes, I tell kids that if they enjoy reading Harry Potter, they should read my book too (laughs out). Sometimes, truth is easier to understand through fiction because our minds struggle to conceive such possibilities otherwise. But let’s keep an open mind. Unlike many sadhus who use intoxicants like ganja or ayahuasca, I don’t consume any narcotics or alcohol. Everything I have seen and experienced is real for me, at least. Reality can be subjective. What is real for one person may not be real for another.\nYou were born into a Muslim family but later followed a Hindu spiritual path. How do Islamic religious organisations perceive you?\nThey are generally very angry with me. However, as I don’t actively challenge them, they leave me alone. But they cannot accept my choices. In Shariah Islam, changing one’s faith is considered blasphemy and is punishable by death. I have received threats, but I don’t care.\nYou were among those who played a key role in restoring peace in Kannur. How did that happen?\nWhen our padayatra was passing through Malappuram and Kannur, I was warned. But I decided to walk. On my right side were RSS workers, and on my left, CPM workers. That may have been a first in the history of Kerala. After the padayatra, I decided to make an attempt to bring peace. When I met some leaders, I knew that everybody was interested in stopping violence. I met the top brass in RSS in Delhi. On the Left party’s side, the onus was on the district secretary, P Jayarajan. I met him. We held three meetings in Kannur with the top leaders of CPM and RSS, including Pinarayi Vijayan, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Gopalan Kutty. We settled the issue and held a peace walk through Kannur, with all of them participating.\nThe RSS is celebrating its 100th year of its formation. Your views on RSS...\nMany people harbour a lot of misunderstanding about RSS. Take the instance of the recent discussions around Gyanvapi Masjid (in Varanasi). What did RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat say? He said there is no need to excavate everywhere (under each mosque) to look for Shiva Linga. This is a message. All said and done, RSS is hundred percent nationalist. For them, the country is everything. If it is being threatened politically, physically or culturally, they object. It may be right or wrong, but they object. That’s my experience.\nIs that the reason you face opposition from Muslim fundamentalist groups?\nIt could be. If there is one text, one scripture and one teacher, then there are chances of more such instances. But if we take this side (Hinduism), it offers variety. It isn’t based on just ‘one’. Having ‘one’ has its advantages, but there are disadvantages too. People who do namaz five times a day will do so irrespective of whether it’s a railway station or a bus stand. Their strength is that millions of people do namaz facing one direction at the same time. Will our people (Hindus) openly chant a gayatri mantra or sandhya vandanam? Our strength (that of Hinduism) is that we are ready to acknowledge that we need not always head in one direction. I’m not saying that either of these needs to change. There’s something in between these two. We need to arrive at a consensus.\nYou have stated that two women have majorly influenced your life — your mother and your wife. Can you elaborate?\nI’ve only one regret in my life — my mother suffered a lot when I wandered around. Since there was no communication for three and a half years, they didn’t even know whether I was alive. So, I still have a connection with my mother through my mind. My wife is a simple person.\nThere’s a theory that whatever we experience in this life is because of our karma in past lives. What’s your take?\nYes. I cannot think about Vedanta without considering the influences from my past lives.\nSo, according to you, are there rebirths?\nHundred percent! It’s my experience. For me, it’s not a theory though it cannot be proven (smiles).\nWhat’s the ultimate truth?\nIt’s very difficult to define the ultimate truth. In my opinion, it is to discover the divinity in you. In the core of our being, there’s divinity. Such a spark is present in all human beings. Spiritual life is to discover that spark. The aim is to discover your true self, who you actually are!\nFollow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest",

    "text": "Disagreements over Israel's future military presence in Gaza and over Palestinian prisoner releases are obstructing a ceasefire and hostage deal, according to ten sources familiar with the round of US-mediated talks that concluded last week. The sources, who include two Hamas officials and three Western diplomats, told Reuters the disagreements stemmed from demands Israel has introduced since Hamas accepted a version of a ceasefire proposal unveiled by US President Joe Biden in May. All the sources said Hamas was especially concerned about the latest demand to keep troops deployed along Netzarim Corridor, an east-west strip that prevents free public movement between north and south Gaza, as well as in a narrow border strip between Gaza and Egypt known as Philadelphi Corridor. Israel's current grip on the Philadelphi Corridor gives it control of Gaza's frontier with Egypt, the enclave's only crossing that does not border Israel. Hamas sees Israel as having changed its conditions and parameters \"last-minute\". Hamas was also worried that any concessions it made would be met by more demands, one of the sources told Reuters. The media office for the Palestinian group did not respond to the requests for comment for this story. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office also did not comment on the talks.

    "text": "Voir mon actu Suivre Le Courrier du Pays de Retz Améliorer l’état écologique des cours d’eau, des milieux aquatiques et gérer la ressource, voici les ambitions du contrat territorial eau 2024-2026 pour le bassin versant des rivières Acheneau et Tenu.\nUne enveloppe de 5,5 millions d’euros doit permettre de mener des actions sur cette période, de Touvois à Frossay en passant par Nantes métropole . Dix masses d’eau au total, dont six cours d’eau définis comme des territoires prioritaires.\nPour une meilleure continuité écologique « Après la dissolution du Syndicat d’aménagement hydraulique et la mise en place du Syndicat de bassin versant Grand Lieu Estuaire (SGLE) , il fallait se structurer, explique François Charruau, directeur de la structure coordinatrice. De nombreux travaux ont été initiés dans le précédent contrat, les concertations ont été menées. Toutes les actions vont être réalisées, car l’équipe est bien organisée aujourd’hui. »\nLa restauration morphologique et la continuité écologique des cours d’eau se présentent comme le bloc de dépenses le plus important, avec plus de 2,8 millions d’euros hors taxe, soit 54 % du budget.\nL’objectif est de remettre en marche le réseau aquatique, l’ensemble du système hydraulique. Lutter contre les inondations et lutter contre la sécheresse, c’est le même combat ! La priorité est de revitaliser le bassin versant, notamment tous les petits ruisseaux auxquels nous n’apportons pas assez d’importance.\nClaude Naud, président du SGLE Cela devrait se concrétiser en redonnant un bon fonctionnement à 35 km de cours d’eau. Il est aussi prévu d’ aménager ou d’effacer 53 ouvrages pour limiter leur impact sur les milieux. Et afin de rétablir les grands axes migratoires, le contrat programme la transformation de cinq plans d’eau et la suppression d’un ouvrage majeur.\nVidéos : en ce moment sur Actu Bien faire fonctionner le marais Parmi les autres opérations à conduire, il y a la restauration de la fonctionnalité des marais pour 455 500 € HT afin de favoriser la biodiversité et maintenir la lutte contre les espèces invasives, comme la jussie.\nLes techniciens du syndicat Grand Lieu estuaire vont restaurer la continuité écologique de ce cours d’eau à Machecoul Saint-Même. ©Laurent RENON L’un des enjeux est de limiter les ruissellements des eaux pluviales vers le milieu aquatique (435 500 € HT). Pour cela, 24 km de haies seront plantés et 23 zones tampons seront aménagées.\n421 000 € seront dédiés aux analyses de la qualité d’eau et l’acquisition de connaissances et 437 000 € aux études et aux accompagnements extérieurs.\nQuant à l’animation du contrat et l’organisation des comités avec les acteurs du territoire, ainsi que la communication, près d’un million d’euros y seront consacrés.\nÀ lire aussi\nComment le port de Pornic se prépare à une grave pollution L’Agence de l’Eau Loire-Bretagne (2,8 millions d’euros), la Région des Pays de la Loire (513 000 €) et le Département de Loire-Atlantique (558 000 €) financent 70 % de ce contrat territorial eau, un outil commun pour faciliter l’action locale.\nLe reste est pris en charge par les cinq communautés de communes, qui sont également les maîtres d’ouvrage des travaux : Sud Estuaire, Nantes Métropole, Grand Lieu, Sud Retz Atlantique et Pornic agglo Pays de Retz.\nSuivez toute l’actualité de vos villes et médias favoris en vous inscrivant à Mon Actu .",

    "text": "The India Meteorological Department has issued a heavy rainfall alert for Tamil Nadu until December 14. Severe waterlogging has been reported, prompting warnings for multiple districts. Moderate thunderstorms and rain are predicted for several regions, with potential disruptions in traffic. The weather system may weaken over the coming days. Devdiscourse News Desk | Updated: 13-12-2024 10:03 IST | Created: 13-12-2024 10:03 IST\nVisuals from Trichy district (Photo/ANI). Image Credit: ANI Country: India SHARE The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday sounded an alarm over an impending bout of heavy rainfall slated to drench various districts of Tamil Nadu until December 14. Already, relentless showers have triggered severe waterlogging in Trichy, with areas such as Thoothukudi witnessing moderate to heavy downpours.\nThe IMD forecasts moderate thunderstorms coupled with heavy rain in districts like Ariyalur and Perambalur, extending to Thiruchirapalli, Karur, and beyond. Affected localities can expect waterlogging, which may disrupt traffic flow. Elsewhere, light thunderstorms are probable over Cuddalore, Salem, and parts of Tirunelveli, with Thiruvallur and Chengalpattu receiving light rain.\nIn addition, heavy to very heavy rainfall may hit isolated spots in southern India, notably in Karaikal and the islands of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar. A low-pressure system, once positioned over the Gulf of Mannar, is moving westward toward Maldives, and could dissipate in its journey.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nREAD MORE ON: Tamil Nadu IMD rainfall alert weather forecast waterlogging thunderstorms Gulf of Mannar low-pressure system traffic disruptions southern India Advertisement ALSO READ IMD Issues Rainfall Alert for Tamil Nadu Amid Severe Waterlogging",

Foto Rubicela Morelos / archivo\nUn balacera registrada en una tienda “Del Sol” ubicada en plena zona centro, dejó como saldo a un hombre muerto y tres mujeres lesionadas.\nDe acuerdo a versiones de testigos, sujetos armados perseguían a un hombre quien intentó esconderse en el interior de dicha tienda, la cual se ubica a unos metros de la Presidencia Municipal, pero éstos no se detuvieron y sin más dispararon, hiriendo a personas que realizaban compras para los festejos de fin de año, para luego darse a la fuga.\nDe manera inmediata se alertó al servicio de emergencias 911 para alertarlos y pedir ayuda para las personas lesionadas, mientras que en el exterior del establecimiento la gente corría atemorizada y con crisis de pánico ante la balacera.\nAl lugar llegaron elementos de seguridad de los tres órdenes de gobierno, quienes acordonaron el sitio para asegurar los indicios balísticos por parte de la Fiscalía General de Guanajuato.\nEn tanto, paramédicos de cuerpos de emergencia trasladaron a las 4 personas heridas; el hombre murió cuando recibía atención médica, en tanto, una mujer no requirió de hospitalización pues sufrió heridas leves.\nLa Secretaría de Seguridad Ciudadana de Irapuato confirmó el hecho y señaló que pese a que se montó un operativo especial de seguridad no se logró dar con los responsables de dicho ataque armado, y refrendó su disposición por coadyuvar con la Fiscalía de Guanajuato para dar con los responsables.",
