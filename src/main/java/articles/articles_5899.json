    "title": "The Smart Fabric That Could Transform U.S. Navy Survival Gear",
    "text": "A smart fabric capable of generating energy through movement and temperature changes is being developed by an international team of researchers, backed by the U.S. Office of Naval Research Global (ONRG). This innovative textile is designed to power communication systems and health monitoring devices.\nScientists expect the technology to be used in wetsuits for U.S. Navy personnel. Moreover, with some modifications, the fabric could be adapted for various applications, including dive fins, biosensor-equipped bras for female aviators, hovercraft skirts, inflatable boats, unmanned underwater drones, and flexible coatings for energy harvesting in robots operating both underwater and on land.\nThe research project, named Dual Envelope Multifunctional Fabric, is led by researchers from Tec de Monterrey, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Federal University of Ceará in Brazil. Their aim is to innovate a textile material based on polyethylene (PE). This material combines piezoelectric and thermoelectric effects, meaning it generates electric charges in response to deformation and thermal variations.\nThe U.S. Navy is funding the project, having selected it as one of the winners in the 2023 ONR Global-X Challenge in the category of Multifunctional Fabric for Survivable Platforms.\nLuis Marcelo Lozano, a researcher at Tec, explained to TecScience that he and his colleagues are developing a textile prototype focused on the needs of divers as primary users, while also considering other applications relevant to survival environments.\n“We aim to achieve [multifunctionality](/en/tech/advanced-materials/) using two types of components: a passive one, featuring the properties of polyethylene to provide protection against high-pressure depths and thermal regulation for low temperatures, and an active one with piezoelectric and thermoelectric fibers to generate electricity,” he elaborated.\nLozano emphasizes that their project was one of six chosen worldwide in this competition to receive funding and support.\nTextile Material with Sustainable Properties\nThe textile being developed by the researchers consists of two layers of polyethylene fibers, bonded by a spacer—similar to a cavity—and interwoven with additional fibers that can embed other materials to generate energy.\nThe passive component features functionalities that do not require any energy source to operate. For instance, through a collaborative project with MIT, they have enhanced PE-based textiles with improved thermal characteristics, water absorption, and stain resistance compared to others in the fashion industry, such as cotton.\nTraditionally, polyethylene has been overlooked for clothing due to its water-repellent chemical structure. However, by modifying its structural and surface properties, it can be harnessed to offer features that are even beneficial for a diving suit.\nFor example, the hydrophobic properties enable the creation of a functional spacer within the fabric, acting as a protector and thermal insulator to help keep the diver’s body warm despite the frigid temperatures found at depth.\n“Polyethylene is a very straightforward material in terms of structure, primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen. It allows us to play a bit with heat, whether we make it transparent to thermal energy or modulate the size of the fibers to reflect it, thereby maintaining the body temperature within the suit,” says Lozano.\nA Fabric That Generates Energy\nOn the other hand, the active component of the material, which is still under study, would be achieved through fibers capable of generating electricity. This energy could then power communication systems, health monitoring, and active thermal regulation of the suit, among other applications.\nThe first type of fibers are piezoelectric, which allow for “generating electricity from movement. We can envision that the diving suit generates this energy while the diver is in motion, effectively self-powering the system.”\nThese materials have polarization capabilities. Lozano explains that when mechanical deformation occurs, the separation of poles becomes more pronounced, leading to charge generation at the negative pole (electrons) on one side. This charge can then be conducted to the desired device via a conductive element.\nMeanwhile, thermoelectric fibers generate energy from temperature differences, such as that between the diver’s body and the surrounding water.\nIn this context, the researcher notes similarities to the functioning of a thermocouple, an industrial temperature measuring device where positive and negative charges flow through a conductive material; here, the negative charges could also provide energy to a system.\nLozano mentions that the research team is still working on developing the fabric, with preliminary results already showing micro-watt outputs that can be multiplied based on the volume of a functional garment.\nCurrently, their goal is to optimize the fibers and generate enough energy to be detectable by characterization equipment, which would assist in more accurate measurement and management of electrical loads.\n“Even if the fibers are few, just imagine if everything we wear could generate energy from movement or temperature differences—it’s promising for all the applications we could power.”\nLeveraging Fabric Engineering\nThe researcher notes that the active functionality requires adding other materials to the polyethylene, such as PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride), a polymer with piezoelectric characteristics.\nHowever, when other materials are incorporated into the polyethylene fibers, some functionalities do not operate as intended, including passive thermal regulation. The team has been working to address this through a fabric engineering approach that enables various effects within a single material.\n“The most interesting part of the project is that it doesn’t just rely on the fibers; it also involves how we construct the fabric. It’s essentially made up of fibers that can be embroidered or structured in such a way that the fabric fulfills its multifunctionality,” Lozano explains.\nThis fabric engineering also encompasses the different layers of the textile. One layer interacts with the human body, while another interfaces with water, each serving distinct functionalities. Between these layers lies the spacer, which could add another quality to the fabric.\nLozano mentions that the project is expected to be completed in about a year. As a result, they aim to produce a lightweight and flexible material that is still robust enough to withstand deep-sea conditions.\nThis material could serve as an alternative to neoprene, commonly used in diving suits but lacking the features of a smart textile, such as energy generation.\nBeyond diving suits, Lozano emphasizes that the technology behind this textile material could be beneficial for other types of survival gear, such as for firefighters, providing thermal insulation and health monitoring functions.\n“This development aims to help society as a whole. It was proposed as a solution to a challenge faced by the naval sector, but I see potential for commercial use as we move toward clothing that helps monitor vital signs, not just saving energy but generating it for various applications,” he remarks.\nWere you interested in this story?

Pionero observatorio marino en Málaga que estudia el cambio climático en tiempo real En EEUU, las olas que azotan estos días la costa de California dejan imágenes sorprendentes y muy espectaculares. No son técnicamente las de un tsunami, pero las mareas vivas están barriendo todo lo que encuentran a su paso. Algunas olas han alcanzado los 12 metros de altura.\nLas olas cogen desprevenidos a los incautos que ayer se acercaron a la costa californiana a admirar el espectáculo. Toda la fuerza del Pacífico irrumpe en Ventura, Santa Cruz o Long Beach por sus cuatro costados, borrando el litoral y provocando importantes daños materiales.\nOcho heridos por las olas También heridos. Al menos ocho personas tuvieron que se trasladadas al hospital, y lo peor, advierten los meteorólogos, está aún por llegar. Un fenómeno que sorprende a los propios habitantes de California, una de las mecas del surf. Irresistible para los amantes de las olas xxl . \"Es de locos, nunca había visto nada igual\", dicen los habitantes de la zona.\nParedes de agua de 12 metros de altura provocadas, aseguran los expertos, por las violentas tormentas marinas. Un espectáculo tan cautivador como peligroso que pone fin a un año marcado por los fenómenos meteorológicos adversos en la costa oeste de Estados Unidos.\nQué está ocurriendo \"En general, se espera que se trate de un evento excepcional de inundaciones costeras y de alto oleaje que no ha ocurrido en muchos años\", advirtió el servicio meteorológico de Los Ángeles . Los niveles del mar han aumentado a lo largo de la mayor parte de la costa de California durante el último siglo, según muestran los datos de la NOAA, a medida que la temperatura global aumenta y derrite los glaciares y las capas de hielo. El aumento del nivel del mar está empeorando las inundaciones costeras y seguirá haciéndolo en el futuro, según la CNN.\nLas espectaculares aguas han cautivado a algunos surfistas y curiosos, pero las autoridades meteorológicas advierten que las olas y las fuertes mareas pueden poner en peligro a quienes se encuentren cerca. \"Las grandes olas pueden causar lesiones, arrastrar a la gente fuera de las playas y rocas, y volcar pequeñas embarcaciones cerca de la costa\", alerta el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional.\nSíguenos en nuestro canal de WhatsApp y conoce toda la actualidad al momento\nTemas Estados Unidos Tsunami",

    "text": "Captain Pat Cummins' second 10-wicket total in test matches led Australia to a 79-run win over Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on the fourth day of the second cricket test on Friday. Cummins made all the crucial breakthroughs late in the day as the hosts bowled Pakistan out for 237 to win the Boxing Day test and extend Pakistan's losing run in Australian tests to 16 matches. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel Mohammad Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha threatened to push Pakistan towards a win but Cummins ended the 67-run partnership between the pair in bizarre and dramatic fashion just 15 minutes before the scheduled close of play. Australia reviewed a not out call to Rizwan as a Cummins delivery flew into Alex Carey's gloves. But after a long review from the third umpire, Richard Illingworth deemed the ball flicked Rizwan's wrist band that was connected to his gloves. Rizwan was the furious with the decision, with Pakistan 219-5 at the time and starting to believe it could pull off the country's highest successful winning chase against Australia. I got a little bit twitchy there, Cummins said. I felt OK but they were batting nicely. Happy with the Rizwan wicket. It was Cummins who claimed the crucial wicket of his opposing captain Shan Masood (60), before tea. Cummins took his fourth of the second innings just minutes later, dismissing Aamir Jamal (0). The wickets earned him the player of the match award and made him the 10th Australian to pass 250 test wickets. At seven wickets down, Australia opted to take the extra 30 minutes in a bid to complete the match on Friday instead of coming back for day five. The game kept turning. Sometimes it went Australia's way, sometimes ours, Masood said. But when we were leading with bat when me and Abdullah had a good partnership (in the first innings), Pat Cummins came in with that spell. And that is why he is one of the best bowlers in the world.\"\nAustralia was out for 262 in its second innings after losing 4-75 during the morning. Wicketkeeper Alex Carey (53) helped push Australia's lead over the crucial 300-mark with his highest score since the first test of the Ashes in June.

    "text": "Details Emerge About Victor Wembanyama’s Blood Clot\nThe San Antonio Spurs delivered devastating news when they announced that Victor Wembanyama will likely miss the remainder of the season. The 21-year-old phenom has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition requiring blood-thinning medication that makes it unsafe for him to play. The issue came to light after Wembanyama returned to San Antonio following his All-Star Game appearance, shifting all attention to his health and recovery. ESPN insider Shams Charania shed more light on the situation, revealing that Wembanyama started experiencing symptoms after the All-Star break. When rest didn’t alleviate the concerns, the Spurs...\nRead more at The Cold Wire",

    "text": "高考出分放榜，教育话题也在升温。一方面，“屏蔽生”的炒作、落榜生的失意，刺激着未来高考生家长的焦虑神经；另一方面，“是谁在批量制造‘厌学小孩’”冲上热搜，功利教育的危害再次引发热议。怎样对教育进行再认识？提供几个视角供参考。\n有竞争就有焦虑，但为“制造出来的焦虑”买单则需慎重。 一些自媒体为博眼球而贩卖教育焦虑，难逃“利”字；有的培训机构为招揽生意而渲染教育焦虑气氛，就是要挣钱，对其危害应有清醒认识。家长没必要因自己焦虑而盲目从众，逼孩子报这报那，而须应孩子诉求理性选择。\n高考不是终点，人生如同马拉松。未来比拼的是综合能力和素质，分数是一时之得，并不能判定终生。 打开视野，跳出分数看教育，致力于培养孩子的思维能力、实践能力，锻造健全人格，往往“得其大者可以兼其小”。好的教育，要从一生的成长来看。家庭应树立正确教育理念，比如，相较应试技巧，思维训练更根本。家长不妨扪心自问，还记得多少中学时代刷的代数题、做的几何辅助线？随着人工智能时代的到来，孩子未来的竞争优势，不在分数、学位，而是那些无法被算法复制的独特思维。\n成长心理学表明，童年快乐很重要。谁的人生都不可能一帆风顺，困顿挫折在所难免。要让孩子用童年治愈一生，而不是相反。但一些家长唯恐孩子输在起跑线上，甚至在幼儿园阶段就抢跑。过早的知识灌输，不符合孩子的天性，摧毁的是好奇心、想象力，甚至是不会被机器替代的创造力。一些青少年的高分低能、巨婴心态，都与童年经历有关。与其苦心孤诣报班、鸡娃，不如多陪孩子玩耍、亲近大自然。\n良好的亲子关系不可或缺。《心理健康蓝皮书(2023~2024)》显示，青少年更高的心理健康风险与父母情感关怀不足、亲子间缺乏心理健康沟通、父母以低效方式表达高期待等家庭因素有关。试想，如果总是拿“别人家的孩子”的优点跟自己孩子的缺点比，那么孩子不管怎样努力都是难以达到要求的，只会厌学抑郁。\n教育本该是一束光，照亮孩子的心灵。如果拥有健全心智，掌握了学习方法，哪怕一时考试成绩不好，导致发展轨迹不同，只要努力攀登也终会在山顶相会。\n【责任编辑：席聪聪 编辑：王钟的】",

    "text": "Past Lives isn’t on Netflix, but you can still watch it (and cry along) right now There's plenty of rent and purchase options available to check out the romantic drama now. Romantic drama film Past Lives is up for five [Golden Globes](https://netflixlife.com/posts/emma-stone-mesmerizing-poor-things-cant-watch-on-netflix), and I'm completely unsurprised! The achingly heartfelt story about two childhood sweethearts who reconnect years later. It's one of the sweetest movies to come out of 2023. The yearning looks and the obvious connection between Nora Moon and Hae Sung really get the waterworks going! Unfortunately, the beautifully crafted film [isn't available to stream on Netflix](https://netflixlife.com/posts/the-holdovers-is-newly-streaming-just-not-on-netflix). But, you'll definitely want to check it out if you haven't already. Thankfully, there are a few on-demand options to do so! Past Lives is available to rent or purchase on Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV, and Vudu. We shared a breakdown of the choices available below: [Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Past-Lives-Greta-Lee/dp/B0CBHDBRF2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8YMFN6JEUU7G&keywords=past+lives&qid=1704488371&s=instant-video&sprefix=past+live%2Cinstant-video%2C276&sr=1-1)- rent for $5.99 or buy for $19.99 - YouTube - rent between $4.99 and $7.99 or buy for $19.99 - Google Play - rent for $4.99 or buy for $19.99 - Apple TV - rent for $5.99 or buy for $19.99 [Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/browse/details/Past-Lives/2373472?cmp=OrganicSearch~Vudu~GoogleWatch)- rent for $4.99 or buy for $19.99 Honestly it doesn't really matter which platform you choose to rent or purchase the movie. It all comes down to a matter of preference. I personally like to rent films on Prime Video or Vudu. While it's not streaming anywhere right now, that doesn't mean it won't later on. Where could that be? Where will Past Lives stream in the future? In December 2023, Warner Bros. and production company A24 came to a deal to give the former exclusivity in streaming their films. That means going forward, all A24 projects will be going to HBO or Max. While a timeline hasn't been established just yet, I'm hopeful Past Lives will be streaming on Max soon! Now that the season for bigger award shows has kicked off with the Golden Globes on Jan. 7, 2024, I really don't think Max is going to wait much longer to add Past Lives to its catalog. When films get that buzzworthy attention from awards shows, they tend to come to streaming during or right after a ceremony if it's not already available to watch online. Just so you're prepared when the time comes, here's how you can get your hands on a Max subscription. How to sign up for Max - Visit the [Max sign up page](https://auth.max.com/product) - Select With Ads ($9.99/month), Ad-Free ($15.99/month), or Ultimate Ad-Free (19.99/month) - Create an account by entering a username and password - Enter your chosen payment method - Login to start watching! Past Lives is directed and written by Celine Song, who is also up for a [Golden Globes 2024 ](https://goldenglobes.com/nominations/2024)nomination! The movie has been nominated in a total of five categories including Best Motion Picture - Drama; Best Motion Picture – Non-English Language; Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama (Greta Lee); Best Director - Motion Picture (Celine Song); and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture (Celine Song). I'll be honest. I do think the movie has a shot of winning in the Best Motion Picture – Non-English Language, and even possibly lead actress Greta Lee in the Best Performance by a Female Actor section. Though the others might be a bit tough. The film is contending with Oppenheimer, as well as Barbie's Greta Gerwig. There's so many great productions to cheer on. It's so hard to pick! Be sure to cheer on Past Lives at the Golden Globes Sunday, Jan. 7, 2024 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+ with Showtime.",
