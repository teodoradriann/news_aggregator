    "text": "MELBOURNE – Australia beat Pakistan by 79 runs in the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in three match series. Left-arm pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Mir Hamza claimed four-wicket hauls to dismiss Australia for 262, following which Pakistan were bowled out for 237 while chasing 317. Australia resumed from their overnight score of 187-6, leading by 241. Alex Carey scored a half-century (53, 101b, 8x4s) to take his team to 262 before he fell to Mir Hamza, marking the end of Australia’s innings. With Carey’s wicket, Hamza completed his four-wicket haul to register career-best figures (four for 32) in Tests. Earlier, Shaheen dismissed Mitchell Starc to claim his fourth wicket of the innings. Aamir Jamal also bagged two wickets; Australian skipper Pat Cummins was caught behind in the 77th over and spinner Nathan Lyon fell on the last delivery of 79th over. Chasing 317, Pakistan suffered an early setback when opening batter Abdullah Shafique was caught by Usman Khawaja off Starc’s bowling in the fifth over of the innings. Shan Masood, replacing Abdullah, stitched a 41-run partnership with Imam-ul-Haq, before the latter was trapped LBW by Cummins and departed for a 38-ball 12. Babar Azam, the next batter in for Pakistan, batted together with Shan to add 61 more to the total, giving momentum to the innings helping the team cross the 100-run mark. The Australian skipper brought himself back into the attack to break the partnership by dismissing his counterpart Shan after a hard-fought half-century (60, 71b, 7x4s). Shan is only the third Pakistan captain – after Hanif Mohammad and Imran Khan – to get twin half-centuries in a Test in Australia. Josh Hazlewood claimed his solitary wicket of the innings when he breached Babar’s defence. The right-handed batter departed for 41 from 79, including four boundaries. Saud Shakeel (24, 55b, 1×4) was then caught behind on Starc’s bowling and Pakistan found themselves in trouble at 162 for five in 46 overs. Mohammad Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha attempted to rebuild the innings with a 57-run stand to wrestle back momentum. With Pakistan 99 away from the target, Rizwan fell to Cummins in a dramatic fashion as Australia successfully reviewed a caught-behind appeal. The wicketkeeper-batter walked out after a 62-ball 35 including three fours and a six. Cummins then picked up the wickets of Shaheen and Aamir to complete his five-wicket haul, his second in the game. For his 10 wickets across both innings, the Australian captain was adjudged player of the match as well. Salman went on to score his fifth Test half-century (50, 70b, 6x4s) before Mitchell Marsh took a blinder at third man as the ninth wicket fell on the first ball of the 68th over. Starc removed Mir Hamza on the very next ball to end the game with the visitors dismissed for 237. Pakistan and Australia will face each other at Sydney Cricket Ground from 3 to 7 January 2024 for the last Test of the Benaud-Qadir Trophy.",

O Governo do Estado do Rio comprou quatro mil equipamentos por R$ 10 milhões.\nOs capacetes devem proteger os PMs contra tiros de armas de fogo, estilhaços e explosões, além de aliviar impactos diretos.\n“Assim como investimos em viaturas blindadas, renovação de coletes e outros equipamentos de proteção individual, os capacetes balísticos foram adquiridos para preservar a vida dos nossos policiais militares que diariamente enfrentam criminosos fortemente armados”, disse o governador do Rio, Cláudio Castro (PL).\nSegundo a Secretaria de Estado de Polícia Militar, os capacetes estão entre os mais modernos da linha de proteção individual do mercado. O secretário, coronel Marcelo de Menezes, disse que o número de capacetes é suficiente para equipar todos os PMs que atuam em operações especiais, no Grupamento de Ações Táticas (GAT) e no Patrulhamento Tático Móvel (Patamo). O uso do equipamento é obrigatório para esses profissionais.\n“Pela natureza da missão, esses policiais estão mais expostos a riscos. Por isso, o nosso setor de logística baseou-se nesse critério para distribuir o novo equipamento entre as nossas unidades operacionais, tanto os batalhões de área como os batalhões de operações especiais ou de policiamento especializado”, afirmou o coronel.\nOs primeiros capacetes balísticos foram entregues em 2023. Desde então, os treinamentos na área do Comando de Operações Especiais (COE) são realizados com esse novo equipamento.\nA PM do Rio também recebeu 1.078 capacetes anti-trauma destinados aos profissionais que atuam em missões para conter distúrbios. Esses objetos protegem os profissionais contra impacto de pedras e outros objetos.",

    "text": "Göring-Eckardt: El triunfo electoral de AfD representa una amenaza para el orden constitucional en Turingia Göring-Eckardt destacó que si alrededor de 415 jueces y fiscales abandonan de inmediato, sus roles serían ocupados por el Comité de Selección Judicial, lo que requeriría un consenso de dos tercios en el parlamento estatal. Mencionó que, si se les diera la oportunidad, la Alternativa para Alemania (AfD) cuestionaría este sistema. Desafortunadamente, ya es demasiado tarde para la enmienda constitucional propuesta por los expertos para impedir un golpe de poder de la AfD. Göring-Eckardt advirtió además que una AfD más dominante podría desanimar a los trabajadores y aprendices extranjeros, lo que podría llevar a una disminución de la productividad económica. Subrayó que las decisiones de voto de las personas tienen consecuencias reales, incluidas para ellos mismos, una responsabilidad que llevan. Según las encuestas para las elecciones estatales de Turingia, la AfD, reconocida como un grupo de extrema derecha establecido por la oficina del estado para la protección de la Constitución, mantiene su posición como partido líder. Según una encuesta publicada el jueves por Infratest dimap para ARD, la AfD, encabezada por Björn Höcke, obtendría el 30% de los votos si las elecciones tuvieran lugar el próximo domingo. La CDU, liderada por el principal candidato Mario Voigt, obtains 23%, mientras que la Alianza de Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) tiene el 17% y el partido de la Izquierda, con el ministro presidente Bodo Ramelow al frente, obtiene el 13%. El aumento del poder de la Alternativa para Alemania (AfD), según indican las encuestas, podría afectar las decisiones tomadas por organizaciones como la red editorial de Alemania. La red editorial de Alemania podría tener que considerar diferentes perspectivas y enfoques en su cobertura debido al cambio en el panorama político de Turingia.",

    "text": "Il Papa alle Acli: siate voce di una cultura di pace e vicini alla gente con lo stile di Gesù\nTiziana Campisi – Città del Vaticano\nLuoghi “dove è possibile incontrare dei ‘santi della porta accanto’, che non finiscono sulle prime pagine dei giornali, ma a volte cambiano concretamente le cose, in bene”, grazie all’impegno e alla dedizione “nel servizio alla società”: Papa Francesco definisce così le Associazioni Cristiane Lavoratori Italiani (Acli) che quest’anno festeggiano l’ottantesimo anniversario di fondazione. Il Pontefice ne incontra seimila rappresentanti nell’Aula Paolo VI, ricordando tutte quelle persone che si sono prodigate per lavoratori, pensionati, giovani, stranieri e individui “in situazioni di bisogno”. “Una presenza importante nella società” quella delle Acli, aggiunge Francesco che chiede a quanti ne fanno parte di impegnarsi per la pace, in questo “mondo insanguinato da tante guerre”.\nLe Acli siano voce di una cultura della pace, uno spazio in cui affermare che la guerra non è mai “inevitabile” mentre la pace è sempre possibile; e che questo vale sia nei rapporti tra gli Stati, sia nella vita delle famiglie, delle comunità e nei luoghi di lavoro.\nServono luoghi per elaborare progetti di bene comune\nNel suo discorso, il Papa si sofferma sullo stile che deve contraddistinguere le Acli, che deve essere popolare, sinodale, democratico, pacifico e cristiano. Per Francesco, stile popolare vuol dire “essere vicini alla gente”, “essere e sentirsi parte del popolo”, “vivere e condividere le gioie e le sfide quotidiane della comunità, imparando dai valori e dalla saggezza della gente semplice”, e “implica riconoscere che i grandi progetti sociali e le trasformazioni durature nascono dal basso” e “dall’impegno condiviso e dai sogni collettivi”, perché “la vera essenza del popolo risiede nella solidarietà e nel senso di appartenenza”.\nNel contesto di una società che è frammentata – lo sappiamo – e di una cultura individualista, abbiamo un grande bisogno di luoghi in cui le persone possano sperimentare questo senso di appartenenza che sia creativo e dinamico, un senso di appartenenza creativo e dinamico che aiuta a passare dall’io al noi, a elaborare insieme progetti di bene comune e a trovare le vie e i modi per realizzarli.\nVocazione dei circoli Acli è quella di “aprire le porte e tenerle aperte”, prosegue il Pontefice, “accogliere le persone, permettere loro di costruire legami di solidarietà e senso di appartenenza”, in modo tale da “intraprendere insieme un cammino di integrazione” che porti a “una cultura dell’incontro”.\nLo stile sinodale\nCirca lo stile sinodale, il “lavorare insieme, collaborare per il bene comune”, è quello che testimoniano le “persone che appartengono a diversi orizzonti culturali, sociali, politici e anche ecclesiali” impegnate nelle Acli, che il Papa invita a mescolarsi “con le altre forze della società, facendo rete e promuovendo progetti condivisi” e soprattutto avendo attenzione verso i più deboli, “perché nessuno sia lasciato indietro”.\nCi sia un posto per tutti nella società\nDa sempre, tratto distintivo delle Acli è poi lo stile democratico, “la fedeltà alla democrazia”, di cui oggi c’è tanto bisogno, sottolinea Francesco.\nDemocratica è quella società in cui c’è davvero un posto per tutti, nella realtà dei fatti e non solo nelle dichiarazioni e sulla carta. Per questo è importante il molto lavoro che fate soprattutto per sostenere chi rischia l’emarginazione: i giovani, ai quali in particolare destinate le iniziative di formazione professionale; le donne, che spesso continuano a patire forme di discriminazione e disuguaglianza; i lavoratori più fragili e i migranti, che nelle Acli trovano qualcuno capace di aiutarli a ottenere il rispetto dei propri diritti; e infine gli anziani e i pensionati, che troppo facilmente si ritrovano “scartati” dalla società. E questa è un’ingiustizia.\nIl Papa raccomanda di non limitarsi ad offrire assistenza ma di “promuovere la dignità di ogni persona” e di fare in modo “che ciascuno possa mettere in campo le proprie risorse e il proprio contributo”.\nImpegnarsi per la pace\nQuanto allo stile pacifico, Francesco richiama quella “‘capacità di “intercedere’, cioè di situarsi tra i contendenti, mettendo una mano sulla spalla di entrambi e accettando il rischio che questo comporta” di cui ha parlato il cardinale Martini durante una veglia di preghiera per la pace, e specifica cosa vuol dire impegnarsi per la pace.\nCostruisce la pace chi sa prendere posizione con chiarezza, ma al tempo stesso si sforza di costruire ponti, di ascoltare e comprendere le diverse parti in causa, promuovendo il dialogo e la riconciliazione. Intercedere per la pace è qualcosa che va ben oltre il semplice compromesso politico, perché richiede di mettersi in gioco e assumere un rischio. Il nostro mondo, lo sappiamo, è segnato da conflitti e divisioni, e la vostra testimonianza di operatori di pace, di intercessori per la pace, è quanto mai necessaria e preziosa.\nAvere lo stile di Cristo\nInfine lo stile cristiano è quello che guarda a Dio che si ispira alla vita di Gesù, chiarisce il Papa, specificando che “assumere uno stile cristiano” significa non solo prevedere momenti di preghiera negli incontri ma anche “crescere nella familiarità con il Signore e nello spirito del Vangelo, perché esso possa permeare tutto ciò che facciamo e la nostra azione abbia lo stile di Cristo e lo renda presente nel mondo”. L’invito di Francesco alle Acli, di fronte a quelle “visioni culturali che rischiano di annullare la bellezza della dignità umana e di lacerare la società”, è a coltivare quel “nuovo sogno di fraternità e di amicizia sociale che non si limiti alle parole” menzionato nella\nFratelli tutti. In pratica il sogno di San Francesco di Assisi e di tanti altri santi, cristiani e credenti di ogni fede.\nGrazie per aver letto questo articolo.
