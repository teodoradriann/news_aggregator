    "text": "Quando i genitori hanno udito il bambino rantolare mentre dormiva e hanno contattato il 118, il medico dell’ospedale di Monterotondo, nella Città metropolitana di Roma, ha prontamente visitato d’urgenza il bambino di due anni, individuando alcuni frammenti di un giocattolo nell’esofago. È stato immediatamente attivato il trasferimento con l’elicottero del 118 al policlinico Gemelli, ma purtroppo il piccolo è deceduto dopo il trasferimento.\nLa procura della Repubblica di Tivoli ha avviato un’indagine su questo tragico evento, con i carabinieri della compagnia di Monterotondo incaricati dell’indagine.\nLa sostituta procuratrice Arianna Armanini, della procura di Tivoli, secondo quanto ha appreso l’agenzia LaPresse da fonti giudiziarie, ha aperto un fascicolo d’inchiesta dopo la morte del bimbo di 2 anni soffocato da una parte di giocattolo, con l’ipotesi di reato di omicidio colposo contro ignoti. Il procuratore capo d Tivoli, Francesco Menditto, ha inoltre disposto accertamenti sulla provenienza e sul tipo di giocattolo ingoiato dal bimbo nella sua abitazione a Monterotondo, alla porte della Capitale.\nIn una nota, il policlinico Gemelli ha spiegato che il bambino è arrivato in ospedale, dal nosocomio di Monterotondo, già in morte cerebrale dopo oltre un’ora di rianimazione cardiopolmonare. I genitori hanno dato il consenso al prelievo degli organi, che è stato fatto ieri notte.",

    "title": "Trump tariffs unsettle spring real estate market | wfaa.com",
    "text": "DALLAS — Spring is more than just a weather season -- it is the start of \"the season\" in real estate. And this year, the season was looking really good at first, says Broker Joe Atkins of Joe Atkins Realty.\n“We had a lot of momentum that last week in March, which is usually kind of the start of the spring market as school ends,” Atkins said.\nBut then came April. And the Trump tariffs.\nAtkins said that early momentum was quickly lost, and so were some offers, including on a 4-bedroom Lake Highlands home on the market for $750,000. The listing had quickly gotten two offers, but then the tariffs were announced, and “one of the offers was pulled immediately.\"\nAtkins wasn’t the only realtor who went through this. He said one of the largest brokerages in North Texas told him lots of deals have come undone.\n“In April, they had about half of their contracts terminate…largely due to fear of the tariffs,\" Atkins said.\nBut why? It’s not like homes were being imported into the country and were therefore subject to the new Trump taxes.\nAtkins said it was because tariffs made buyers worry about the cost of living increasing, a possible recession, the safety of their jobs, and their investments that were getting battered in the stock market.\nThat might all help to explain this: Redfin says in April, there were almost half a million (490,041) more home sellers than buyers. That causes the inventory of homes for sale to build up.\nAtkins noticed that phenomenon in just one price range in his own neighborhood.\n“In Lakewood, our inventory for houses priced $2-2.5 million, three years ago, there were five homes for sale in that price point. There are 33 right now. There are a lot of other neighborhoods that have the same issue,” Atkins explained.\nAccording to the Texas Real Estate Research Center, major markets across Texas recently had a greater supply of homes sitting -- waiting to be sold -- than we have seen going all the way back to 2012, even 2011.\nDFW had 4.32 months of inventory (the most since September 2012), the Houston area had 4.59 months’ worth (the most since August 2012), the San Antonio metro had 5.34 months (the most since November 2012, and the Austin area had 5.25 months of homes for sale (the most since August 2011).\n'Gridlock market'\nAtkins calls this a \"gridlock market.\" To try to get it moving, he said many sellers have been cutting their asking prices. Atkins points out that, “Nationally, we've seen more price reductions this year than we've seen in all of the last five years”.\nHere is what he is referring to: Data shows that in the first quarter of 2025, prices were reduced on U.S. homes for sale 265,970 times. That's more price reductions in the first quarter than there were in 2024 (201,536 price reductions), 2023 (174,024 price reductions), 2022 (70,039 price reductions), 2021 (86,812 price reductions), 2020 (209,399 price reductions).\nAtkins said buyers should make their best offer, because a seller might be open to that offer or something close to it. Atkins says he has seen specific instances that back that up.\n“Absolutely, I've been blown up on both sides of the transaction -- buy and sell -- by seeing what somebody is willing to take,\" Atkins said.\nSome sellers are also offering enticements now that go well beyond price cuts and beyond paying the commission of the buyer’s agent, including “giving away trips.\"\n\"You know you're trying to do anything you can that might spur activity,\" Atkins said. \"It always doesn't just come down to price. Sometimes it just comes down to getting enough people to see your house.”\nIf you are selling, Atkins advises that you pay close attention to trying to price your property competitively from the beginning. He also says to beware that in some areas where prices have fallen off faster. If you’re relying on recent comparable sales around you to help you determine how much you’re asking, those previous prices of like homes that sold even just a few months ago may be higher than what the market will bear now.\nBut homes are still going for quite a bit more than they have historically, so Atkins advises you to make sure yours is ready to be lived in. The more updated it is, the more likely it is to sell because many cash-strapped buyers don’t have the extra money for a fixer-upper project.\nFinally, more competition, price reductions, and more days on the market can be disheartening to sellers, but Atkins says when mortgage rates start to come down significantly, get ready for the buying frenzy.\n“The second rates do come down, you're going to see a run on the market,\" Atkins said. \"We know when rates come in, there are a lot of people on the sidelines that are going to jump in.\"\nThat’s good news for sellers. The not-so-good news: we don’t know when those mortgage rates will finally fall significantly again.",

    "title": "Maumee River's 50th anniversary as a scenic and recreational waterway is celebrated",
    "text": "By By Tom Henry / The Blade ,\n4 hours ago\nBlessed by some of this summer’s more pleasant weather, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources marked the 50th anniversary of the Maumee River’s state scenic and recreational designation on Thursday.\nYes, hard as it is to believe, there was a sunny blue sky and a soft, summer breeze, near-perfect conditions that were a far from the kind of dangerous heat, humidity thick enough to choke on, or wicked thunderstorms that seemed so commonplace this year.\nIt was as picturesque of a day as northwest Ohio could have expected as a few dozen people gathered at 3 p.m. inside Providence Metroparks to hear a few brief remarks by Ohio DNR Director Mary Mertz and Metroparks Toledo Executive Director Dave Zenk, followed by a number of activities until 7 p.m.\nThose included food trucks, with a mobile kitchen offering walleye sandwiches and 50th anniversary cupcakes.\nThere were educational booths and exhibit tables, with some netting demonstrations.\nAlso offered were guided hikes, live music, paddling demonstrations, discussions about plants and aquatic species, and an additional trip offered aboard a popular Metroparks feature, The Volunteer, a reproduction of a mule-drawn canal boat that once was a primary source of transportation in the 1800s.\n“People were just relaxed and having a good time,” Ms. Mertz told The Blade after giving her remarks.\nThe original 1974 “scenic” designation includes 43 miles of the Maumee River from the Ohio-Indiana state line to the U.S. Route 24 bridge, west of Defiance. The scenic river section is characterized by a broad meandering floodplain, with heavily forested stream banks, the Ohio DNR said.\nAn additional 53 miles, from the U.S. 24 bridge west of Defiance to the U.S. 20/S.R. 25 bridge at Perrysburg and Maumee, was later designated as “recreational.” That section of the river was also received the special designation because some of the historical features within the river corridor, as well as its natural beauty.\nAlthough the Maumee River designation does not apply to the portion of the river near downtown Toledo that has been used for commercial shipping and other industry, Ms. Mertz lauded Metroparks for bringing people down to the river there with its Glass City Metropark and the five-mile Glass City Riverwalk under construction now.\nThere has been a lot more activity along the waterfront in recent years, such as kayaking and rowing clubs, plus concerts and more outdoor recreation in general.\n“You have the same sense of majesty whether you're in the city or in one of the scenic areas,” Ms. Mertz said.\nMr. Zenk said the Maumee River figures prominently into seven of the park district’s properties, starting with Side Cut Metropark in Maumee - the first metropark it created. The other six are Fort Miamis, Bend View, Middlegrounds, Providence, Farnsworth, and Glass City metroparks.\n“It was a great event not only to celebrate the designation, but also the river,” he said. “It’s really shaped the course of Metroparks.”\nGov. Mike DeWine is soon expected to sign legislation that attempts to clarify the rights of private property owners along rivers, Ms. Mertz said.\nAnxiety about that has kept the state from designating more rivers than it would like as scenic and recreational, she said.\nThere are currently 15 designated. The main restriction imposed by such designations is on municipalities wanting to put large structures, such as bridges, over them, Ms. Mertz said.\nIn her prepared remarks, Ms. Mertz said northwest Ohio has benefited from “the foresight of the communities and agencies who supported the designation and have served as caretakers for this magnificent river for 50 years.”\n“The high quality of the river has been maintained and not only provides habitat for native flora and fauna, it also enhances the quality of life in northwest Ohio,” she said.\nMr. Zenk noted in his prepared remarks that the seven metroparks along the Maumee River consist of 924 acres and 11.4 miles of shoreline.\n“The Maumee River is part of our history and our future, both as a community and a park system,” he said.\nThe river’s watershed encompasses more than 5,000 square miles, and it drains some of America’s richest farmland, the Ohio DNR said.",
