    "text": "By Vincent Frank ,\n52 minutes ago LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are on the verge of potentially shocking the NBA world. It was noted earlier on Thursday that Los Angeles is in talks with legendary UConn head coach Dan Hurley to fill the void left after the firing of Darvin Ham.\nHurley’s name had not come up until Thursday, with JJ Redick previously seen as the favorite in the club house for the job.\nHiring Hurley would represent a coup for the Lakers. He’s highly respected in the college ranks and has won multiple national championships with the Huskies.\nHurley, 51, would be seen as a potential long-term option on the bench for the Lakers. It’s something the team has been seeking since making the decision to fire Ham.\nAs for James, we’re now hearing more about his involvement in the Lakers’ process of hiring a new head coach. It might not be what you think.\nRelated: Cleveland Cavaliers emerge as one of the favorites to sign LeBron James in free agency\nLeBron James uninvolved in Los Angeles Lakers head coach search Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports According to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin , King James has not had any conversations with the Lakers’ brass about his opinion when it comes to a new head coach. James wants the Lakers to make a decision based on what’s best for them beyond his playing days.\nIt was noted previously that James might play just two more seasons in the NBA. Whether that’s with the Lakers remains an open question. The all-time great is slated to opt out of his contract and could hit NBA free agency this summer.\nLeBron James stats (2023-24): 25.7 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 8.3 APG, 54% FG, 41% three point As for the broader Lakers search, Anthony Davis is said to be heavily involved in the process. He’s said to prefer former Charlotte Hornets head coach James Borrego. Though, that report came before Hurley was mentioned as the front runner for the job.\nMore must-reads:\nAtlanta Hawks rumors: New report suggests coach Quin Snyder pushing to draft specific player with No. 1 pick Detroit Pistons rumors: Team now evaluating Monty Williams’ status after Trajan Langdon hiring TNT making last-ditch effort to retain NBA coverage rights Expand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Gobierno de Biden amenaza con demandar a Texas por su nueva ley de inmigración\nRocío Muñoz-Ledo\n(CNN) — El Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos amenazó con demandar a Texas por su nueva ley de inmigración en una carta enviada este jueves, según una copia que CNN obtuvo del documento. Esto supone la escalada más reciente entre el presidente Joe Biden y el gobernador de Texas, el republicano Greg Abbott, sobre la gestión de la frontera entre EE.UU. y México.\nA principios de este mes, Abbott promulgó una ley, conocida como SB4, que otorga a las autoridades locales la facultad de detener a los inmigrantes y a los jueces la capacidad de emitir órdenes para deportarlos de Estados Unidos.\nLa nueva ley de inmigración de Texas siembra confusión e incertidumbre a lo largo de la frontera\nLa Casa Blanca criticó la ley, al calificarla de “increíblemente extrema”. Se espera que entre en vigor en marzo.\nEn una carta dirigida a Abbott, el Departamento de Justicia argumentó que la medida “se antepone y viola la Constitución de EE.UU.” y también amenaza con afectar la capacidad del gobierno federal para hacer cumplir la ley de inmigración.\n“En consecuencia, Estados Unidos tiene la intención de presentar una demanda para impedir la aplicación de la SB4 a menos que Texas acceda a abstenerse de implementar la ley. Estados Unidos se ha comprometido tanto a asegurar la frontera como a garantizar el procesamiento de los no ciudadanos de conformidad con la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad (INA). La ley SB4 es contraria a estos objetivos”, afirma la carta, firmada por el subsecretario adjunto Brian Boynton.\n¿Cómo es la nueva ley de Texas que penaliza la entrada irregular de migrantes al estado? Las claves de la polémica ley SB4\nLa amenaza legal de este jueves se produce después de que el Departamento de Justicia demandara a Texas por el uso de boyas flotantes en el río Grande. La demanda sigue su curso en los tribunales.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

Chapman reunited with Bob Melvin in the Bay Area once again and so far it seems as if it's a perfect fit. The Padres are (4-5) on the season and the Giants are (2-5) after getting swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in LA. Here are the [MLB Odds](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/mlb), courtesy of FanDuel. MLB Odds: Padres-Giants Odds San Diego Padres: -1.5 (+172) Moneyline: -102 San Francisco Giants: +1.5 (-210) Moneyline: -116 Over: 7.5 (+100) Under: 7.5 (-122) How to Watch Padres vs. Giants Time: 4:35 ET/1:35 PT TV: MLBTV Stream: fuboTV ( [Click for free trial](https://www.fubo.tv/stream/mlb/?irad=377812&irmp=492408)) Why The Padres Will Cover The Spread/Win Dylan Cease is on the mound for his second start in a Padres uniform. In his first outing against this Giants squad, he earned the loss allowing three runs (two earned) in the 9-6 loss to the boys up north. He lasted only 4.2 innings but on the bright side, he did K up six hitters and allowed only two hits. It just so happened that Fernando Tatis Jr. misread a ball in the outfield which resulted in extra base runners and a run. If he can keep the pitch count within reason, we could see Cease pitch a quality start Friday night. The reigning Platinum Glove defender is leading the Padres offensively with a .303 average and three home runs. The Friars are seeing some solid offensive production from a handful of guys who are all batting over .286. Jake Cronenworth, Xander Bogaerts, and Tatis all have 10 hits on the season. However, Luis Campusano has 12 on the year which is fourth in the league and is second among all catchers. The only three hitters with more are Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, and Will Smith. If Campusano can keep up his hot hitting with a line of .400/.400/.600 and OPS of 1.000, then the Padres' lineup can be dangerous. Why The Giants Will Cover The Spread/Win Toeing the slab for the Giants is right-hander Jordan Hicks. In his first outing as a full-time starter against the Friars last week, Hicks pitched as well as you could hope for. In five shutout innings, he struck out six hitters and allowed only three hits. The 27-year-old has expressed his desire to start and he proved it. He has spent most of his time as a reliever as that is what the St. Louis Cardinals are known for doing with their pitching prospects. Now as a Giant, he can revamp his career as a starter. Expect him to once again showcase his stamina by going another four-plus innings against San Diego. The offense did not travel well from SD to LA over the weekend. They kept all three games close for the most part but failed to capitalize on key moments to take down the Dodgers. SF only had five hits in the finale which won't be enough to win ballgames. Jung Hoo Lee only had three hits in the series and Matt Chapman only had two. If the Giants are to bounce back, then those two newcomers will need to be a major part of it in front of their home crowd. Michael Conforto is batting .370 with 10 hits on the season. He has been most of the offense for SF to begin the campaign. Final Padres-Giants Prediction & Pick You don't see this too often, the Padres are favored on the spread while the Giants are favored on moneyline. The oddsmakers are predicting a close game which will result in a one-run contest. The Giants are home for their home opener and I expect them to keep this within a run at the very least. Take them to cover the spread against the Padres despite the high cost.
