    "text": "—\nThe non-profit organization is now accepting applicants into the Intensive Peer Recovery Program (IPRP), which will take place over the course of four consecutive weeks. The program is open to patients coming out of clinical treatment and recovering individuals who feel that they are unable to remain sober.\nFor more information, please visit\nhttps://healingus.org/intensive-peer-recovery-program/\nPeer support provides numerous benefits to individuals suffering from substance use disorders, especially when delivered in tandem with clinical treatment. According to a scientific review in Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation, studies have shown that members of peer support groups experience increased self-esteem, positive feelings of accomplishment, and a heightened ability to cope with challenges.\nHealingUS Communities’ IPRP is a more intensive option compared to typical peer support groups and focuses on re-introducing members to a sober lifestyle. The end goal of the program is to empower participants with the means to achieve long-term abstinence by allowing them to connect with other members of HealingUS, which is recognized as one of the most successful recovery communities in Toms River.\nThroughout the program, members will have the opportunity to participate in individual and group skill sessions that are intended to help them transition into society. These sessions will be facilitated by trained Peers in Recovery, who will aid participants in gaining independence, regulating their emotions, and relearning life skills essential for the earliest stages of recovery. Because HealingUS Communities acknowledges there are many ways to recover from addiction, the IPRP will also teach members recovery skills through 12-step facilitation and specific programs such as Refuge Recovery, Recover 2.0, and SMART Recovery.\nTo keep track of their progress, clients will form a Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP), which they can discuss and revise through weekly meetings with recovery coaches. Those in need of additional clinical care and mental health services can also consult their peer case managers, who will provide them with the resources to secure the treatment they require.\nAbout HealingUS Communities\nHealingUS Communities is a New Jersey 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was founded in 2012 to fill the gaps in alcohol and drug addiction treatment. Their recovery programs have helped thousands of families to date.\nInterested parties can learn more by visiting\nhttps://healingus.org/\nContact Info:\nName: Ashley Regan\nEmail:\nSend Email\nOrganization: HealingUS Communities\nAddress: 260 Casino Drive, Farmingdale, NJ 07727, United States\nPhone: +1-866-798-3232\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.healingus.org\nRelease ID: 89126292",

    "text": "By Julia Bayly ,\n2 hours ago This story was originally published in January 2022.\nThere is nothing fun about an ice-covered driveway or walkway. Unfortunately, the go-to method of spreading rock salt to de-ice those surfaces is also bad for the environment.\nThat does not mean you need to slip and slide your way through a Maine winter. There are several alternatives to rock salt that do the job just as well.\n“Rock salt is toxic to the environment in high concentrations,” according to Bill Sheehan of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection’s Presque Isle office. “Generally, what we use in our driveways or on our front steps is not an issue [but] it’s a good idea to minimize its use as much as possible.”\nRock salt can also create problems for pets, who pick it up through their paws when walking on it. Paw pads can become sore, cracked and even burned from repeatedly stepping on the rough salt crystals.\nIt can also make pets very sick if ingested, causing vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, tremors, seizures, shortness of breath and disorientation.\nSo, for the sake of the environment, wildlife and pets, it’s not a bad idea to consider alternatives to rock salt.\nSand absorbs the sunlight, which helps melt the ice. It also adds traction so you can walk on it without slipping and falling.\nIf you don’t have sand, you may have the solution right in your cupboard or pantry.\nVinegar contains enough citric acid to melt snow and ice, though it may take several applications for it to completely do the job.\nCoffee grounds can also be spread on the ice instead of being tossed out. Like sand, the grounds absorb sunlight to make the ice melt faster and add a bit of traction.\nWood ash , likewise, can be spread on the ice instead of disposed of. It absorbs sunlight to help ice melt and provides traction.\nAlfalfa meal is a natural fertilizer that melts ice, is grainy so it gives some traction and it will help boost the quality of your soil.\nSugar beet juice , if you can find it in enough quantities, lowers the melting point of ice and snow. It’s safe for pets, plants and wildlife.\n“Alternatives are a good idea,” Sheehan said. “[Rock salt is] not good for the environment or for the critters who are not used to it.”\n1",

    "text": "The Endangered Species Act turns 50 today. Here are some of Maine's biggest success stories Fifty years ago, on December 28, 1973, President Richard Nixon signed the Endangered Species Act into law. Since then, some high-profile Maine species have received protection under the act. There have been some conspicuous successes, but some species face increasing threats from the effects of climate change. When Mark McCollough started studying bald eagles in 1981, they were federally protected, and Maine only had about 70 pairs left. “They were the last eagles in New England,\" he said. \"So conserving and preserving this small population that was mostly lived Down East along the coast was so important if we were ever going to restore eagles back to the Northeast.” McCollough recently retired after working for more than 30 years as an endangered species wildlife biologist for both the state and federal government. In that time, he has seen the eagles rebound to a population of more than 700 nesting pairs in Maine, and witnessed a recovery sufficient to have them delisted, in 2007. When the Endangered Species Act, or ESA, was signed into law in 1973, there were no peregrine falcons nesting east of the Mississippi, and they were among the first to be listed for protection. “But now we have several dozen pairs of peregrines nesting in most of our larger cities on bridges, on buildings, on cliffs out in the forest,\" McCollough said. \"So they’ve largely recovered their populations here in Maine.” Other Maine species face a more difficult climb. Canada lynx, Atlantic salmon and piping plovers are still protected under the act. The plovers are rebounding following conservation measures, their population increasing tenfold from a low of about a dozen pairs, while lynx and salmon still face many challenges. Meanwhile, climate change threatens all three species, and many others, says Maine Audubon policy advocate Francesca Gundrum. “We need to talk about the biodiversity crisis in tandem with the climate crisis, as we are seeing steep declines in Maine, too, of some species that were once abundant at the population level,\" she said, \"We’re seeing large-scale changes.” Gundrum says the ESA is an appropriate tool to protect wildlife from challenges posed by climate, and other risks. But she says it and other pioneering legislation of the 1970s, such as the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act, are constantly being targeted by forces in Congress that want to see them weakened. “What we’re advocating for as the state’s largest and oldest wildlife conservation organization, is to keep the ESA strong, to keep it intact, to keep it well-funded, all of the above,\" Gundrum said. And the ESA has generated plenty of controversy over the years. Maine’s entire congressional delegation and then-Gov. Angus King strongly opposed the listing of Atlantic salmon in 2000. More recently, tensions have flared between federal regulators and Maine lobstermen over regulations designed to protect the endangered North Atlantic right whale. And in July, U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine's 2nd District voted to strip ESA protections for the northern long-eared bat — an effort vetoed by President Joe Biden. McCollough says the ESA has been controversial since the get-go, citing the impact of a rare flower on a dam proposed for the St. John River more than 40 years ago. “The Dickey-Lincoln dam would have flooded its habitat, but that went to the federal courts, and was a hard-fought battle by environmentalists,\" he said. \"And Congress ended up decommissioning the plans for that dam, primarily because of the endangered species status of the Furbish’s lousewort.” But he and other advocates of the ESA say that in most cases, it has accommodated both the needs of plants and wildlife and the demands of humans.",

    "text": "El 2023 fue un año complicado para los atletas mexicanos de disciplinas acuáticas debido a que no recibieron la beca por parte de la Comisión Nacional de Cultura Física y Deporte (Conade) que encabeza Ana Gabriela Guevara , debido a los problemas legales que atraviesa la Federación Mexicana de Natación. Justo las polémicas declaraciones de Guevara contra el equipo de nado artístico a quiénes les dijo que podían vender “Avón o Tupperware”, generaron reacciones negativas en redes sociales, como resultado a esto la han considerado “corrupta”.\nLa plataforma de encuestas México Elige realizó la última encuesta del 2023 y Ana Gabriela Guevara fue considerada la política más corrupta del gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\nLee también Mario García será director técnico del Cartaginés; es el quinto entrenador mexicano en Costa Rica\nAna Guevara comentó que los deportes acuáticos seguirán sin apoyos\nLos encuestados consideran que en el gobierno de AMLO sí hay corrupción, específicamente un 63.3%, un 25.1% considera que no lo hay y el 11.6% respondió que no lo sabía.\nAl ser cuestionados sobre los personajes políticos más corruptos, la lista la encabezó Ana Gabriela Guevara con un 63.9 en el índice de percepción de corrupción, el político que le siguió en este índice fue Manuel Barlett de la CFE con 57.4 y el tercero lo ocupó Alejandro Gertz de la FGR con un 55.8.\nRecientemente en la entrega del Premio Nacional de Deportes 2023, Ana Guevara reiteró que para 2024 los atletas mexicanos de disciplinas acuáticas seguirán sin sus becas y apoyos económicos.\nLos personajes políticos mexicanos más corruptos, según los encuestados son: @AnaGabrielaGue , @ManuelBartlet y Alejandro Gertz; mientras que los menos corruptos son: @TorrucoTurismo y @aliciabarcena . #MxElige . pic.twitter.com/LIeXdelptn\n— México Elige (@MxElige) December 11, 2023 Lee también Alexis Vega le da ‘Me Gusta’ a la llegada de Gabriel Fernández a Cruz Azul ¿También irá a la Máquina?\nCheco Pérez sufre \"menosprecio\" de los pilotos de la F1 en la última votación del 2023",
