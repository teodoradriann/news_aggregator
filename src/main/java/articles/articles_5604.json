    "text": "Vienne (AFP) - Trois personnes soupçonnées d'être impliquées dans un réseau islamiste ont été arrêtées en Autriche, ont annoncé dimanche les autorités alors que Vienne et Berlin ont renforcé la sécurité autour des églises et marchés de Noël en raison d'un \"risque accru\".\n\"Intervenant sur un réseau islamiste\", les autorités autrichiennes ont arrêté quatre personnes samedi, a indiqué le ministère de l'Intérieur. Un porte-parole du ministère a ensuite indiqué que parmi ces quatre, trois restaient détenues dans l'attente d'investigations complémentaires.\nLa suite après la publicité Citant \"un risque accru\", la police a par ailleurs renforcé les contrôles, notamment autour des églises, cérémonies religieuses et marchés de Noël à Vienne.\n\"Il n'y a pas de menace immédiate d'attaque à Vienne\", a néanmoins précisé le porte-parole de la police.\nSamedi, la police autrichienne avait indiqué dans un communiqué que \"des agents terroristes en Europe appellent à mener des attaques contre des évènements chrétiens, spécialement autour du 24 décembre\".\nLes autorités allemandes ont en parallèle annoncé avoir renforcé les mesures de sécurité dans et autour de la cathédrale de Cologne notamment, l'une des plus visitées du pays, en raison d'un risque de sécurité lié à une menace qualifiée d'\"islamiste\".\nLa suite après la publicité Les fidèles se rendant aux services religieux de Noël doivent se soumettre à de stricts contrôles à l'entrée notamment.\n\"Nous apprécions tous nos traditions de Noël et nous ne nous laissons pas intimider\", a déclaré la ministre allemande de l'Intérieur, Nancy Faeser, dimanche au groupe de presse régional Funke.\n\"Mais nous prenons la menace terroriste islamiste très au sérieux et sommes extrêmement vigilants\", a-t-elle ajouté, \"nos services de sécurité surveillent les milieux islamistes et agissent en conséquence, comme le montrent les mesures en cours\".\nSelon le site du quotidien allemand Bild samedi, des services de sécurité en Autriche, Allemagne et Espagne ont reçu des indications selon lesquelles un groupe islamiste voudrait commettre plusieurs attentats en Europe, possiblement à la Saint-Sylvestre et à Noël.\nSelon le journal, les cibles de ces attentats pourraient être des messes de Noël à Cologne, Vienne et Madrid.\nLa suite après la publicité Il affirme également qu'une personne a été interpellée en Allemagne.\nD'après Bild, les personnes arrêtées sont des Tadjiks soupçonnés d'avoir voulu perpétrer des attaques au nom de l'Etat islamique au Khorassan (EI-K), branche locale de l'EI en Afghanistan.\nDes fouilles avec des chiens renifleurs effectuées samedi soir par la police dans la cathédrale de Cologne n'ont pas abouti à la découverte d'objets suspects.\nEn juillet, une cellule d'islamistes présumés de l'EI-K avait été démantelée en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas. Les personnes arrêtées en Allemagne étaient soupçonnées de vouloir commettre une attaque dans le pays.\nburs-jza-ylf/blb",

    "title": "Neural Notes: Stop building AI startups with “the same crap” as everyone else",
    "text": "Welcome back to Neural Notes, a weekly column where I look at some of the most interesting AI news of the week. In this edition: warnings for startups relying too heavily on generic AI models and how AI has changed the relationship between VCs and founders.\nThe proliferation of startups riding the gen AI wave over the past two years has been industry-changing. But while the technology is undeniably transformative, for both businesses and VCs, it’s a double-edged sword.\nAre too many founders leaning on off-the-shelf AI models without building anything genuinely innovative?\nThis was the critique from Pedram Mokrian, a seasoned venture capitalist and lecturer at Stanford University, during Assembly 2024: A VC Catalyst Conference in Melbourne this week.\nOrganised by LaunchVic and The Wade Institute , the conference brought together investors and founders to explore the future of venture capital and the Australian startup ecosystem.\nDuring a panel titled Startup Investment 2025+ , Mokrian pointed to a growing trend of ‘AI’ companies that fail to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market.\n“One thing I’m worried about with the advent of AI is most of the startups will look more similar than dissimilar because the tools are now available to everyone in the same ways,” Mokrian said.\n“We all use the same generative AI for assets, for images, for code, and things will look more similar than dissimilar for a while as we navigate this next phase.”\nMokrian warned that startups relying entirely on generic AI models are failing to address what he called the “network effect problem” – the ability to create scalable, unique value through defensible advantages like proprietary data or specialised applications.\n“Really large outcomes, venture-backed outcomes, require some amount of defensible network effects, which is unclear how using the same crap everyone else uses gives you defensible network effects,” Mokrian said.\nAI’s effect on the relationship between founders and VCs The rise of AI has also contributed to the change in traditional dynamics between founders and VCs. Thanks to advancements in cloud computing, open-source AI tools, and large language models (LLMs), the cost of launching a startup has plummeted.\nFounders now have access to powerful tools without needing significant upfront capital. This, combined with alternative funding sources , has somewhat shifted the balance of power.\n“Founders need VCs less than ever before,” said Aaron Batalion, co-founder of LivingSocial and now an active angel investor.\nPanelists agreed for VCs to remain relevant, they need to offer strategic value beyond financing.\n“If you don’t need my money, what else?” Batalion said.\nHe went on to cite emerging approaches where VCs offer unique resources like GPU access to attract founders who might no longer rely on traditional funding routes.\n“There are some funds in Silicon Valley that just give people access to GPUs… If that’s their special sauce, let us invest in your company,” Batalion said.\nAI startups solving real problems Despite these critiques, Assembly 2024 did highlight examples of startups using AI to solve deeply entrenched problems.\nAs part of the keynote panel, hosted by yours truly, we heard from the founders of Andromeda Robotics and InTruth AI in a panel titled Empathy, Technology, Connection and You.\nAndromeda Robotics , founded in 2022, has developed Abi, a humanoid companion robot designed to provide support and companionship for older adults in aged care facilities and children in hospitals.\nEquipped with AI and machine learning, Abi can recognise faces, express emotions, and assist with daily tasks. Abi can be equipped with different personalities to suit individual organisations – anything from sassy to Christian – to combat loneliness and improve quality of life.\nInTruth AI uses consumer-grade wearables and proprietary AI to track emotional states in real-time, offering users actionable insights to better understand and manage their emotions.\nBy translating raw data from wearables into emotional patterns, InTruth has the potential to revolutionise mental health support across individual and organisational contexts.\nThroughout the day we also heard about other AI-powered startups making tangible differences.\nOne standout case was an AI-powered pest management platform – RapidAIM – that uses predictive algorithms to help farmers identify and mitigate infestations before they occur.\nAnother example was an AI-driven computer vision platform for meat processing facilities, which enhances safety protocols and operational efficiencies.\nUnlike generic applications of AI, these solutions address urgent, niche problems. They’re evidence of how the thoughtful deployment of technology can lead to real transformative change in the world.\nThe key takeaway from the day, at least in regards to AI, was that founders who merely layer AI on existing solutions – or rely on other company’s out-of-the-box solutions – may struggle to stand out.\nHowever, startups that take the time to innovate, leveraging AI to address specific, high-impact challenges, have the potential to transform industries and create real value.\nNever miss a story: sign up to SmartCompany’s free daily newsletter and find our best stories on LinkedIn .",

Residents in 12 properties were given the “all clear” on Wednesday (July 9) afternoon.\nAccording to Emergency Info BC, an evacuation alert issued by the Lytton First Nation for three of its reserves – Spintlum Flats 3, Lytton 3A and Lytton 32 – remains in effect for now.",

    "text": "BYD Hungary Plant to Produce 300000 EVs Annually Europe Sales Surge 300 as It Challenges Tesla\nBYD’s aggressive expansion into Europe is reshaping the global electric vehicle (EV) landscape, positioning the Chinese automaker as a formidable challenger to Tesla and traditional Western automakers. The company’s new factory in Szeged, Hungary, set to begin production by year-end, underscores its commitment to dominating the European market. By 2030, the plant aims to manufacture 300,000 compact EVs annually, tailored to European urban environments. This move, part of a broader strategy to establish a \"Made in Europe, for Europe\" brand identity, reflects BYD’s ambition to bypass trade barriers and capture market share through localized production [1].\nBYD’s global sales have surged, with 4.25 million vehicles sold in 2024—10 times its 2020 output—and projections of 5.5 million units in 2025. In the second quarter of this year, BYD outsold Tesla globally, with nearly 607,000 EVs compared to Tesla’s 384,000 [2]. The shift is particularly pronounced in Europe, where BYD sold 55,000 cars in the first half of 2025, a threefold increase from the same period in 2024 [3]. Analysts attribute this growth to BYD’s cost advantages, including vertical integration of battery production and government subsidies, which have slashed prices for European consumers.\nThe company’s strategy hinges on aggressive pricing and rapid product innovation. BYD’s Dolphin Surf, priced below €20,000 in Europe, offers a stark contrast to Tesla’s Model 3, while its flash-charging technology promises 670 miles of range per charge. These features, combined with a 150,000-unit annual production target at the Szeged plant by 2026, highlight BYD’s ability to scale quickly. Executive Vice President Stella Li, overseeing global expansion, emphasizes the company’s focus on time-to-market, with BYD launching 40 new models since 2020—twice the pace of Western competitors [4].\nHowever, BYD’s rapid growth is not without challenges. Analysts warn of financial risks, including rising supplier debt and reliance on Chinese state subsidies. The company’s balance sheet revealed \"external current account\" charges, while S&P Global Ratings flagged \"brutal price wars\" in China eroding profitability [5]. Despite these concerns, BYD’s vertical integration—covering batteries, semiconductors, and raw material mining—gives it a structural cost edge, according to UBS estimates [6].\nIn Europe, BYD’s presence is expanding beyond Hungary, with plans to open 1,000 sales points across 12 additional countries this year. The firm’s European headquarters in Budapest, including a 2,000-engineer research center, signals its long-term commitment to the region. This strategy aims to capitalize on European consumers’ sensitivity to price and range while circumventing tariffs that have stifled Chinese EVs in the U.S.\nWhile Tesla remains a dominant force in the U.S., its European market share is under threat. Elon Musk’s recent decision to take over operations in the region suggests growing concern over BYD’s gains. The latter’s success is also challenging legacy automakers like Volkswagen, whose EV sales doubled in early 2025 but still trail behind BYD’s momentum [7].\nBYD’s ascent reflects a broader shift in the automotive industry, driven by Chinese manufacturers leveraging scale, innovation, and cost discipline to redefine global competition. As it solidifies its foothold in Europe, the company’s ability to balance aggressive expansion with financial sustainability will determine whether it can maintain its lead—or face pushback from increasingly adaptive Western rivals.\nSource: [1] https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/byd-china-electric-cars-europe-hungary-manufacturing/\n[2] https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/byd-china-electric-cars-europe-hungary-manufacturing/\n[3] https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/byd-china-electric-cars-europe-hungary-manufacturing/\n[4] https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/byd-china-electric-cars-europe-hungary-manufacturing/\n[5] https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/byd-china-electric-cars-europe-hungary-manufacturing/\n[6] https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/byd-china-electric-cars-europe-hungary-manufacturing/\n[7] https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/byd-china-electric-cars-europe-hungary-manufacturing/\nComments\nNo comments yet",

New Year's Eve could be a wet one for parts of eastern Australia, with more severe weather forecast for the weekend. The Bureau of Meteorology says widespread showers and possibly thunderstorms are set to return to New South Wales and Queensland from Friday. Northeast NSW will bear the brunt of the rain in that state, with isolated and possibly severe thunderstorms into Sunday. Scattered showers are forecast for the remainder of the coast, with the chance of storms. Queensland is also expected to be hit by wet weather, with isolated showers and thunderstorms forecast across much of the state on Saturday, apart from the far southwest. \"Severe thunderstorms are possible ... between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days,\" according to senior meteorologist Sarah Scully. Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia. Showers and storms are a chance across parts of southern and eastern Australia on Friday, mainly NSW, eastern South Australia, and northern Victoria, Ms Scully said. There is a risk of severe thunderstorms about Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions. \"Severe thunderstorms will become more widespread from this weekend,\" she said. \"The focus areas will be northeast NSW and southeast and central Queensland. \"There are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday.\" Storms and flash flooding across southeast Queensland have claimed seven lives since Christmas and caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure. Thousands of people remain without power in dangerous heatwave conditions not expected to ease until Saturday. Wild weather has also ravaged NSW and Victoria, with three people killed by flash flooding and a falling branch on Boxing Day.",
