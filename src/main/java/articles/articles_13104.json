    "title": "Prepare for a Hot Keir Summer",
    "text": "Forget the much drooled-over Rat Boy summer, it seems we’re in for a Hot Keir one. The entry of Labour into government this week has made certain female journalists come over all peculiar. Caitlin Moran has documented these current heightened arousal levels over at the Times where she claims that every middle-aged woman she knew felt “fruity” the day after Starmer’s arrival at No. 10. Her observations were backed up in Metro, where a lady hack breathlessly described how the “new Daddy in town” — aka the Prime Minister — was “turning up the heat in Westminster”. In another unfortunate image, particularly for any readers stuck in a sweaty, overcrowded railway carriage, one X user was quoted as saying that “some of us have been on the horny Keir train for quite some time”. Meanwhile, in the Spectator, Zoe Strimpel was engaging in a forensic analysis of the “beefcake-adjacent” leader and his “rugby player face”, which came out very well in comparison to poor David Cameron’s reported absence of chin, “thin lips and tiny mouth, more like a fish’s than a person’s”. Starmer, Strimpel marvelled, “looks like he could actually take someone on in a fight. He looks like if furious he could be dangerous. He looks, in short, like what one used to think men ought to look like.” My first response was to go and find some current footage of the man in order to check which of us had lost the plot. Sure enough, I found the familiar stolid features and adenoidal vowels of a 61-year-old chartered surveyor, and not Russell Crowe in Gladiator as I had been momentarily led to believe. In fact, in common with nostalgic paeans to British imperialism, a lot of the hype around Starmer’s hotness seems to be based on what he looked like when a lot younger: first, like a [New Romantic](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/02/could-keir-starmer-student-picture-win-votes) lead singer and later like the dad in Bluey. My second thought was to wonder whether such pieces were covertly aimed at establishing their authors’ fealty, either for strategic or ideological purposes — a bit like a Pravda apparatchik rhapsodising over Khrushchev’s beneficence, or some hack on CNN insisting that President Biden is still compos mentis. So much of modern life seems to require pretending, as convincingly as possible, that you don’t see what you do see, or do see what you don’t. Or perhaps the heat is down to hypergamy in human females, also known as the spectre haunting the manosphere’s nightmares: the idea that women are particularly attracted to high-status partners, leading them to shun more Lilliputian types who long to get laid, yet remain cruelly untouched. Obviously, there is something in this. No other explanation of Rupert Murdoch’s continued allure as husband material makes sense. And many of my lesbian friends have an otherwise inexplicable yen for Penny Mordaunt, especially when she’s wielding a ginormous sword. Ditto Strimpel’s simultaneous hots for Nigel Farage, whom she was waxing lyrical about only a few weeks ago. But as a generalised explanation of human female mating choices, based on the instances I know of, hypergamy has never rung true; surely even less so, then, as an explanation of female sexual fantasies about men they are unlikely ever to meet. (It’s probably the case that women tend to want what other women want, [René Girard](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctv2gjwthv.8) style, but that’s not quite the same thing). And anyway, the role of British Prime Minister after years of decline hardly screams take-me-now, world-straddling omnipotence. If powerful politicians are your thing, you might as well go abroad for your fantasy kicks and spend a transgressively thrilling half hour with Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping instead. Not for nothing are there [headlines](https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmaedw/i-pretended-to-be-a-young-joseph-stalin-on-tinder-and-it-went-weirdly-well) out there like “I Pretended to Be a Young Joseph Stalin On Tinder, and It Went Weirdly Well”.",

The national forecaster officially marked the northwestern counties of [Donegal](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/donegal), [Leitrim](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leitrim), [Sligo](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/sligo) and North [Mayo](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mayo) with a Status Yellow rain warning as heavy rainfall is due with a risk of flooding possible, valid from 6am to 9pm on Friday. Read More: [Ireland live lightning tracker as weather warnings issued and Met Eireann names 'hotspots'](https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/ireland-live-lightning-tracker-weather-31761995) Carlow Weather's Alan O'Reilly says that up to 30mm of rainfall is possible over a 24-hour period in these counties in line with the Status Yellow warning. A separate Status Yellow wind warning is in place in the south going into Saturday too, as [Cork](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cork), [Kerry](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kerry), [Waterford](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/waterford) and [Wexford](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wexford) are earmarked to receive \"strong to gale force and gusty\" winds, leading to potential coastal flooding when coupled with high Spring tides. The warning comes into effect between 2am to 12pm on Saturday. Met Éireann's forecast the weekend is as follows, starting with Friday: \"Windy at first this morning with fresh to strong and gusty westerly winds, gradually easing. There will be sunny periods and some showers for much of the country, some of which will be heavy. However, showery rain will persist in parts of the north and northwest for much of the day with some localised flooding likely and a chance of a little sleet in the north too. Highest temperatures of 4 to 8 degrees, possibly a little lower in some northern parts.\" \"Some clear spells at first tonight with just isolated showers. Lowest temperatures of -1 to +3 degrees with some frost and icy stretches forming with light to moderate southwesterly or variable breezes.\" The forecast shows a similar outlook for Saturday: \"A wet and windy start to the day with widespread rain, heavy or thundery at times with some localised flooding possible. The rain will clear to sunny spells and showers from the western half of the country through the morning, extending to all areas through the afternoon. \"Some showers will be heavy with a chance of isolated thunderstorms and hail. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5 to 9 degrees, coolest in the northwest. Fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest.\" Sunday - New Year's Eve - has can expect the following: \"Breezy or windy with sunny spells and scattered showers and a chance of hail. Fresh to strong and gusty westerly or cyclonic variable winds will gradually decrease moderate to fresh and gusty through the day. Highest temperatures of 6 to 9 degrees generally.\" New Year's Eve revellers in particular will be interested in the Sunday night forecast: \"Showers will continue overnight, mainly for Atlantic counties with longer spells of rain possible in the northwest. Some frost or ice will form with lowest temperatures of 0 to 4 degrees in mostly moderate westerly winds.\" The outlook for Monday is: \"Sunny spells and scattered showers at first, becoming more isolated through the morning and early afternoon. Cloud will build from the southwest later. Highest temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees in light to moderate southwest winds, backing southerly and falling mostly light later.\" Met Éireann says Tuesday will see outbreaks of rain and drizzle in the south will clear through the morning, becoming dry until night with some showers and highest temperatures of 3C to 6C degrees.

    "title": "Former Marie Curie Laboratory in Paris Saved from Demolition by Minister of Culture, Rima Abdul-Malak",
    "text": "A former Marie Curie laboratory in Paris was threatened with demolition to build a new scientific center. The project triggered the anger of heritage defenders. Faced with the controversy, the Minister of Culture, Rima Abdul-Malak, finally suspended the destruction of the building.\nThe first excavator operations were to start on Monday January 8. They are finally canceled. The Pavillon des Sources, where physicist Marie Curie worked and located in the Latin Quarter in Paris, was at the center of a dispute between defenders of heritage and supporters of the construction of a new building. A demolition permit was granted in March 2023. The Minister of Culture, Rima Abdul-Malak, announced on Friday January 5 on Curie Institute.\nThis morning I spoke with Thierry Philip, president of the Institut Curie. We agreed that he suspend the demolition of the Pavillon des Sources to give himself time to examine, with the stakeholders and my colleague @sretaileau, any possible alternative. — Rima Abdul Malak (@RimaAbdulMalak) January 5, 2024\nThe Institut Curie cancer center, on the Sainte-Geneviève mountain, had launched this work to expand and open the first biological chemistry center for cancer in Europe, representing a major advance for science. The building was to rise five floors and extend over 2000 m² but required the destruction of the Pavillon des Sources, a small stone and brick building used by Marie Curie, double Nobel prize winner, for her work on radium. An eventuality contested by heritage defense associations who refuse to allow a historic building to be destroyed, very close to the Pantheon where the scientist and her husband Pierre have been resting since 1995.\nHowever, the heritage value of the Pavillon des sources is contested: for Thierry Philip, as for the grandson of Marie Curie, it is a “place of storage of radioactive sources but not a laboratory”, reports AFP. Except that the Curie Museum itself indicates on its site that the researcher there “formed a team for the manufacture of radium emanation bulbs”then used in “military hospitals to sanitize war wounds” during the First\nWorld War.\nStéphane Bern mobilizes to defend the Pavilion\nIn September, the Old Paris Commission, a consultative body of the town hall, had condemned “the massive and disproportionate nature of the project”. The SOS Paris association wants to protect “century-old lime trees” from the garden, explains AFP. Rachida Dati asked Rima Abdul-Malak to register the site as a historic monument to protect it sustainably, even though the Architects of Buildings of\nFrance have issued a favorable opinion for demolition.\nOn\nFrance CultureStéphane Bern said to himself “mobilized” against the disappearance of the Pavilion: “We cannot both demand the cultural and intellectual rearmament of France and destroy what makes its memory and its pride. The destruction of the Pavillon des Sources by the Curie Institute would be a serious fault. What makes it valuable, it is its memorial and symbolic, therefore heritage, dimension.” He did not hesitate to question Emmanuel Macron on the issue.\n-\nRead also\n“Radioactive” – Marjane Satrapi: “I grew up in the myth of Marie Curie”\nIt is therefore the legacy of Marie Curie which is disputed today. The first woman to teach at the Sorbonne and to obtain a Nobel Prize in 1903, she remains to this day the only person to obtain one in two disciplines: physics and chemistry. The debate is frozen for the moment, but nothing says that the demolition permit will be definitively suspended. Discussions must continue to consider alternatives and, perhaps, preserve the Pavillon des Sources.\nZoe SAMIN With AFP\n2024-01-06 00:22:59\n#Paris #demolition #Pavillon #des #Sources #Marie #Curie #heart #lively #controversy",

    "title": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who pleaded guilty to helping kill her abusive mother, is released from prison - Local News 8",
    "text": "By Cheri Mossburg and Harmeet Kaur, CNN\n(CNN) — Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who admitted to helping her boyfriend kill her abusive mother in a case that generated national attention, was released from prison on parole Thursday, a Missouri corrections official told CNN.\nBlanchard pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2016 after confessing that she convinced her boyfriend to stab her mother Dee Dee Blanchard to death as she slept. Prosecutors sentenced her to 10 years in prison in a plea deal after attorneys uncovered the abuse she experienced at the hands of her mother.\nBlanchard was the victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare syndrome in which a caregiver fakes, exaggerates or induces illness in a child to gain attention. Dee Dee was found to have convinced those around her, including doctors, that her daughter was afflicted with leukemia and muscular dystrophy among other ailments — a subject examined in the HBO Max documentary “Mommy Dead and Dearest.”\nBlanchard admitted to being in the house at the time of the murder, knowing her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, was going to stab Dee Dee and doing nothing to stop it, court records show.\nGodejohn was convicted of murder and sentenced in 2019 to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Court filings show he admitted to stabbing Dee Dee and said he only killed her because Gypsy asked him to.\nSpeaking about the conditions of Blanchard’s release, Missouri Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann said, “her original 10-year sentence started in June 2015, so, barring parole violations and other extenuating circumstances, it’s expected that she’ll be on parole supervision and reporting to a parole officer until June 2025.”\nCNN has reached out to Blanchard’s attorney for comment.\nIn the days after Dee Dee’s killing, details started to emerge that revealed a complex and unusual situation, with Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott saying at a June 2015 press conference that “things are not always as they appear.”\n“I’ve never encountered anything that is even close to what Gypsy has gone through,” Blanchard’s attorney Michael Stanfield says in the HBO documentary “Mommy Dead and Mommy Dearest.” “Her mother appeared to have taken great steps to keep Gypsy in a very juvenile role, making her act several years younger than her actual age.”\nIn an interview with People magazine shortly before her release, Blanchard, now 32, said she regretted her role in the killing “every single day.”\n“She was a sick woman and unfortunately I wasn’t educated enough to see that,” she said. “She deserved to be where I am, sitting in prison doing time for criminal behavior.”\nAn upcoming book, “ Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom ,” tells Blanchard’s story through her own perspective, with the help of writers Melissa Moore and Michele Matrisciani. It is set to be published on January 9, 2024.\nA six-hour Lifetime special, “The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard,” featuring interviews with Blanchard from prison, is set to premiere on January 5, 2024. The case was also the subject of the 2019 Hulu miniseries “ The Act ,” starring Patricia Arquette as Dee Dee Blanchard.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "VANCOUVER - British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.",

    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hailed the peace pact signed by the central and Assam governments with ULFA, saying the agreement paves the way for lasting progress in the state. The ULFA's pro-talks faction on Friday signed a peace accord with the central and the Assam governments, agreeing to shun violence, surrender all arms, disband the organisation and join the democratic process. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was present along with Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at the signing of the accord in the national capital, called it a golden day for the people of Assam. Tagging a post on the pact by Shah, Modi said, \"Today marks a significant milestone in Assam's journey towards peace and development. This agreement paves the way for lasting progress in Assam.\" \"I commend the efforts of all involved in this landmark achievement. Together, we move towards a future of unity, growth, and prosperity for all,\" Modi said in his post on X. The United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) was formed in 1979 with the demand for a \"sovereign Assam\". Since then, it has been involved in subversive activities that led to the central government declaring it a banned outfit in 1990. The Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after an agreement for Suspension of Operations was signed between the ULFA and the central and the state governments.

    "text": "El mundo sufre once meses de temperaturas demasiado cálidas PARÍS, Francia. El mundo lleva once meses seguidos de temperaturas anormalmente cálidas, tanto en el aire como en la superficie de los océanos, a pesar del agotamiento del fenómeno climático natural El Niño, informó el observatorio europeo Copernicus el miércoles. El Niño “continuó debilitándose”, dejando vislumbrar un posible respiro más tarde en el año, pero sin cambiar la tendencia fundamental de un calentamiento alimentado por el uso masivo de petróleo, carbón y gas fósil. – Una temperatura por encima de 1,5º C -El mundo registra una media de temperatura anormal desde junio del año pasado. Abril del 2024 no es una excepción a esta regla, con una temperatura media de 15,03° C, lo que representa 1,58° C más que un mes de abril promedio de la era preindustrial (1850-1900). “Aunque inusual, una serie parecida de récords mensuales ya se había observado en 2015/2016”, señala sin embargo Copernicus. En los últimos doce meses, la temperatura global ha sido 1,61° C más alta que en la era preindustrial, superando el límite de 1,5° C establecido por el acuerdo de París. Sin embargo, esta anomalía debe ser observada en promedio durante varias décadas para considerar que el clima ha alcanzado este umbral crítico. No obstante, estos números muestran “cuán notables son las condiciones de temperatura global que experimentamos en la actualidad”, destacó Julien Nicolas, climatólogo del Servicio de Cambio Climático de Copernicus (C3S), en una entrevista con la AFP. El mes pasado fue el segundo abril más cálido jamás registrado en Europa, al igual que lo fue marzo y todo el período invernal. CLIMA EXTREMO “Cada grado adicional de calentamiento climático viene acompañado de eventos climáticos extremos, tanto más intensos como más probables”, recordó Julien Nicolas. Las últimas semanas han estado marcadas por olas de calor extremo en Asia, desde India hasta Vietnam, mientras que el sur de Brasil sufría inundaciones devastadoras. Sin embargo, en cuanto a las precipitaciones, Copernicus no identifica tendencias claras para abril, reportando contrastes importantes en todo el mundo. El mes fue más húmedo de lo normal en gran parte de Europa, pero más seco en el sur del continente y en partes de los Balcanes y Rusia. La situación es similar fuera de Europa: en gran parte de América del Norte, Asia Central y Oriental, en el Golfo Pérsico y en el sur de Brasil, las lluvias extremas han causado inundaciones, que continuaron en mayo. Pero en el norte de México, alrededor del mar Caspio y en gran parte de Australia, la sequía ha predominado. – Océanos: ligera desaceleración – La temperatura de la superficie de los océanos volvió a batir un récord mensual en abril, con un promedio de 21,04° C fuera de las zonas cercanas a los polos, marcando el decimotercer récord mensual consecutivo. Este calentamiento amenaza la vida marina, aumenta la humedad en la atmósfera y pone en peligro la capacidad de los océanos para cumplir su papel crucial de absorber las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero de origen humano. Sin embargo, la temperatura mostró una ligera desaceleración en comparación con marzo y su récord absoluto, de todos los meses (21,07° C). EL NIÑO SE CALMA El fenómeno climático natural El Niño “continuó debilitándose” en abril para dirigirse hacia “condiciones neutrales”, estima Copernicus. Esta variación natural afecta a la zona ecuatorial del océano Pacífico e induce un calentamiento global. “El Niño alcanzó su pico a principios de año”, observa Julien Nicolas, lo que puede explicar una disminución en ciertos valores: en abril, la anomalía de la temperatura del aire es menos pronunciada que en marzo, en comparación con la era preindustrial, y la temperatura de la superficie del océano es menos cálida que en marzo. “Los modelos de proyección indican una posible transición hacia condiciones La Niña en la segunda mitad del año, pero las condiciones todavía son bastante inciertas”, continúa el climatólogo. La Niña es el opuesto de El Niño, que produce efectos contrarios. Sin embargo, la salida de El Niño no cambiará la tendencia fundamental del calentamiento causado por la actividad humana. “Este fenómeno se superpone a tendencias a largo plazo que persisten y están directamente relacionadas con el calentamiento debido al aumento de las concentraciones de gases de efecto invernadero en la atmósfera y a las cantidades de calor que se absorben y almacenan, especialmente en los océanos”, destaca el Nicolas. Estas tendencias continuarán “empujando la temperatura mundial hacia nuevos récords”, predice Carlo Buontempo, director del C3S.",
