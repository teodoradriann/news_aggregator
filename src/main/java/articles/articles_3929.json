    "title": "Details Unfold After Doctor’s Rape and Murder in India Amid Protests",
    "text": "Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of Kolkata early Thursday to protest the rape and murder of a local doctor, calling for justice for the victim and campaigning against the prevalent violence towards women in Indian society. The tragic discovery of the 31-year-old doctor’s mutilated body at a state-run hospital last week has fueled nationwide outrage and sparked a series of protests, compelling Prime Minister Narendra Modi to call for swift punishment for those guilty of heinous acts against women.\nThe crowds marching in Kolkata were part of a larger movement demanding justice, highlighted by a candlelight vigil at midnight that coincided with the start of India’s Independence Day celebrations. Protesters rallied under the powerful slogan “reclaim the night,” emphasizing the urgent need to address violence against women in a meaningful way. Many held handwritten signs advocating for action, with messages like “We want justice” and “Hang the rapist, save the women” resonating through the streets.\nMonalisa Guha, a midnight marcher, voiced her frustrations about the ongoing brutality faced by women, stating, “The atrocities against women do not stop.” Another marcher, Sangeeta Halder, shared her fears, explaining, “We face harassment almost on a daily basis, but not stepping out because of fear is not the solution.”\nDuring his speech at the Independence Day festivities in New Delhi, Modi expressed his “pain” regarding violence against women and recognized the national anger surrounding these atrocities. He stated, “Crimes against women should be quickly investigated; monstrous behavior against women should be severely and quickly punished.” Modi further emphasized that creating a society with confidence and a deterrent effect against such crimes is critical.\nThe medical community has echoed the call for justice, demanding improved security measures following the murder of their colleague. Doctors across numerous government hospitals have halted elective services indefinitely in protest, demonstrating their solidarity with the ongoing protests. Dhruv Chauhan from the Indian Medical Association’s Junior Doctors’ Network expressed the frustration of healthcare professionals, stating, “Doctors nationwide are questioning what is so difficult about enacting a law for our security,” adding that the strike will persist until all demands are formally addressed.\nThe Indian media has reported that the murdered doctor was located in the seminar hall of the teaching hospital, where it is believed she had gone for a brief rest during an arduous shift. An autopsy confirmed the unfortunate circumstances of sexual assault. In a petition to the court, the victim’s parents alleged that their daughter was gang-raped, according to reports by NDTV.\nAlthough police have detained a man employed at the hospital who aided patients in navigating queues, accusations of mishandling the investigation have arisen. To restore public confidence in the investigation, Kolkata’s High Court transferred the case to the prestigious Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Tensions escalated when a mob of approximately 40 individuals, frustrated with police handling of the case, stormed the grounds of R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital early Thursday morning, resulting in property damage and a violent confrontation with police, who had to deploy tear gas to disperse the crowd.\nWest Bengal lawmaker Abhishek Banerjee condemned the vandalism, describing it as “hooliganism,” while acknowledging that the demands of the protesting doctors are “fair and justified.”\nSexual violence against women remains a significant issue in India, with nearly 90 rapes reported daily in 2022, according to National Crime Records Bureau data. Past incidents, such as the brutal gang rape and torture of a young woman in Delhi, have exacerbated this crisis and underscored the urgency for societal change. In response to public outrage following the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, the government introduced harsher penalties for rapists, including the death penalty for repeat offenders, and enacted new offenses like stalking.\nThe recent murder of the doctor in Kolkata intimately resonates with these past tragedies and highlights the persistent struggle against sexual violence in India. The public response reflects a yearning for change and a unified stance against the culture of impunity around such acts of violence.\nSource: original news source",

    "text": "Australians travelling to [Indonesia](https://7news.com.au/news/indonesia) must complete a new health declaration form, as the country attempts to stop the spread of Mpox. Everyone entering the region, which includes popular [travel](https://7news.com.au/travel) destination [Bali](https://7news.com.au/news/bali), must now fill out an electronic self-declaration form, known as the SATUSEHAT Health Pass. “By declaring your health condition and travel history, you contribute to safer travel in Indonesia,” the pass website states. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: [Download today ](https://7news.com.au/app?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link-app&utm_campaign=7news-app) Director General of Air Transportation Maria Kristi Endah Murni announced the implementation pass on Wednesday, [as reported by local media](https://thebalisun.com/tourists-must-download-mpox-tracing-app-before-bali-travel/), which must be completed online before checking in for your flight. It’s understood travellers will then be provided with a barcode containing health and travel history which Indonesian authorities will scan on arrival. Anyone who has Mpox symptoms may be referred to a hospital for treatment on arrival. A guide for International Airport Operators “to take measures to prevent and handle the transmission of Mpox disease at the airport” was also announced. It comes after scientists studying the new Mpox strain that has spread out of the Democratic Republic of Congo say the virus is changing faster than expected, and often in areas where experts lack the funding and equipment to properly track it. That means there are numerous unknowns about the virus itself, its severity, and how it is transmitted, complicating the response, half a dozen scientists in Africa, Europe, and the United States told Reuters. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has been a public health problem in parts of Africa since 1970 but received little global attention until it surged internationally in 2022, prompting the World Health Organisation to declare a global health emergency. That declaration ended 10 months later. In Australia, [health authorities](https://7news.com.au/news/australians-warned-over-mpox-virus-as-new-strain-spreads-overseas-c-15723424) in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria have discovered cases and urged people to stay alert and get vaccinated. The vaccine is free for close contacts of an existing case, sex workers and sexually active gay or bisexual men. A new strain of the virus, known as clade Ib, has the world’s attention again after the WHO declared a new health emergency. The strain is a mutated version of clade I, a form of Mpox spread by contact with infected animals that has been endemic in Congo for decades. Mpox typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions that can kill. It can spread through contact with sores on the skin, bodily fluids including droplets from coughing or sneezing, and contaminated objects such as linen and towels. - With Reuters Stream free on",

    "text": "Mild winters have hidden cost: How a cold snap can help protect ecosystems from invaders Native wildlife thrives in the wintertime, but that's not always true for invasive species. Cold weather may keep some invaders at bay. It’s not really news to anyone that pays attention to the outdoors that this winter has been incredibly mild so far, save for [this week's snow and wind storm](/story/news/2024/01/10/top-wind-gust-speeds-from-ny-storm/72173565007/). Actually, December was about the warmest on record in our area of Western New York, according to NOAA. While many, if not most folks are happy with this current lack of snow and cold, there are some ecological reasons to not be so joyful over these relatively mild climes and times. It is not just skiers, snowmobilers, and ice fishers, the wintertime recreationists, who bemoan our watered-down winter. Yes, our heating bills are lower too. And we haven’t had to shovel the walk. I agree, cold weather, a regular old-fashioned stretch of frigid temps, may be a bit challenging and uncomfortable to us, as well as to our native birds and animals. But it’s a real bane to those southern invasive species that have been making so many devastating inroads into our environment. Our familiar northern species of flora and fauna adapt well and sustain through the coldest snaps, but those hitchhikers, freeloaders, and windborne migrants whose genesis is from the South, or especially the Subtropics, die when the temps near zero degrees Fahrenheit. With the apparent warming trend of the last 30 years or so, we are hearing of and experiencing more and more of the damage done by invasive critters coming into our neck-of-the-woods. Plants, fish, mollusks, insects and molds are just some of the more headline-grabbing new invasive life forms. New York State in 2008 created the Invasive Species Council and Advisory Board, listing many of the species threatening our native plants, including Giant hogweed, Japanese barberry, Japanese knotweed, Purple loosestrife, and even Norway maple, all as threats. These new species often choke out our native plants and take over their ecological niches. Many thrive here because they find few native threats. Researchers have imported their natural enemies and released them in an effort to slow up their advance with mixed success. And the process of importing the invasive species’ enemies can be problematical because we are introducing another species that may out-compete a native down the road. Take the case of Purple loosestrife, a European garden flower that is choking our swamps and wetlands. Two species of an imported beetle are used, one attacks the flower, the other the roots. But who can say what kind of future effect the beetles will have? Invasive insects are devastating certain tree species such as the Hemlock Wooly Algid with its lethal effect on stands of our hemlock trees. The Emerald Ash borer is particularly devastating to stands of ash trees. Others are the Spongy moth (formerly called the Gypsy moth) and the Asian Longhorn beetle. The former is a threat to oak trees, the latter to many hardwood trees. Aquatic life forms, such as the Round Goby and the Zebra mussel, have wreaked havoc in the Great Lakes and other lake waters. And the threat of the Northern Snakehead and the jumping Asian Silver carp are knocking on the door in nearby states. Molds and spores that are invading our environment are particularly insidious. Topping that list may be Phytophythora infestans, popularly known as \"Late Blight.\" Those of us who like to grow a few tomatoes may have been totally bummed out when we had our first encounter with this noxious fungal pest. We certainly are not alone. Its presence has been called a major factor in the great Irish potato famine in the middle of 19th century. One can only hope that by midwinter we’ll experience a stretch of Arctic cold that will have some effect on slowing down the attack of these and many other invasive species that find the subzero temps a challenge. More: [Whitetail bachelor groups are reforming with end of hunting season. How bucks spend winter](/story/sports/outdoors/2024/01/05/how-whitetail-bucks-bachelor-groups-spend-winter-after-surviving-hunting-season/72082443007/) Our native species have unique ways to deal with the cold, and of course thrive better when the competition is diminished. From the tiny ubiquitous chickadee that weighs no more than a quarter, to our whitetail deer that average around 150 pounds, nature has built in natural responses to the cold that get them through. Chickadees winter in hollow spaces in trees. Other wintering birds such as Brown creepers, Kinglets, Nuthatches and Sparrows will actually cluster together in a hollow tree to create a larger and more efficient thermal unit. They find a way to deal with the coldest stretches in winter. But invasive species, whether in the form of insects or plants or others have traditionally been beaten back by mid-winter Arctic fronts, now so few and far between. -- Oak Duke writes a weekly column.",

It added that the court based in The Hague was the proper forum to establish potential criminal responsibility, citing “numerous reports from the United Nations that detail many incidents that could constitute crimes under the ICC’s jurisdiction”. Meanwhile in Chile’s capital, Santiago, foreign minister Alberto van Klaveren said in a news conference that the country supports “the investigation of any possible war crime … whether they are war crimes committed by Israelis or by Palestinians”. The Palestinian foreign ministry welcomed the move. “The referral confirms the urgent need for the Court to fulfill its mandate, to deter, investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes of concern for the international community,” a ministry statement said on Friday. “Israeli officials are not deterred as they continue with their genocidal war,” the statement added. Mexico said it was closely following the case [presented](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/icj-hears-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-over-gaza-war) last week before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which South Africa accused Israel of carrying out genocide in Gaza and demanded that the court order an emergency suspension of Israel’s military campaign. Israel rejected the accusation. Both the ICJ and the ICC handle cases of alleged genocide, with the former resolving disputes between states and the latter prosecuting individuals for crimes. The ICC opened an investigation into Israel as well as Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups for possible war crimes in the Palestinian territories in 2021. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said in November that the investigation now “extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence” since the October 7 attacks. His remarks followed [calls](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/which-countries-back-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-at-icj) from South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Comoros and Djibouti for an ICC investigation into the conflict.

    "text": "Las protestas contra redadas y deportaciones que iniciaron en Los Ángeles y se han extendido hasta la Costa Este marcan un punto de inflexión en nuestra relación con EU. Durante seis meses, hemos navegado entre amenazas, aranceles y cierres fronterizos. Sin embargo, esta no es una crisis más: es un asunto mucho más grave que exige una respuesta de Estado.\nPor mi experiencia como Canciller, entiendo la enorme complejidad que enfrenta el gobierno mexicano, en particular en el trato con Donald Trump. Precisamente por ello, debe procurarse el máximo cuidado en las palabras y la mayor contundencia en las acciones. En cambio, las reacciones gubernamentales han sido inconsistentes, confundiendo a destinatarios internos y externos.\nLa falsa acusación de la secretaria Kristi Noem contra la presidenta Sheinbaum de “alentar las protestas” ilustra los riesgos de combinar una retórica militante y simplista en el interior con una diplomacia meramente reactiva en el exterior. En realidad, la presidenta condenó la violencia en Los Ángeles, pero las arengas dirigidas a sus bases dos semanas antes –llamando a movilizarse contra el impuesto a las remesas– fueron convenientemente sacadas de contexto.\nPoco o nada se ha escuchado de los representantes diplomáticos mexicanos ante esta crisis; y esos vacíos informativos son llenados por otros actores con narrativas perjudiciales. Hasta ahora, quizás el mensaje más oportuno ha sido el del cónsul Carlos González Gutiérrez, un experimentado diplomático de carrera. No se aprecia una estrategia de comunicación coordinada desde la Cancillería. Tampoco hay voceros oficiales fijando la postura nacional en los medios estadounidenses, contrarrestando la desinformación y expresando su respaldo a la comunidad mexicana. Todo lo contrario.\nEn este lado de la frontera, militantes del oficialismo han llegado a celebrar las protestas, alimentando la narrativa que la Casa Blanca necesita para justificar respuestas cada vez más firmes. No es posible ignorar que una gran mayoría de estadounidenses de hecho respalda el endurecimiento de las medidas contra la migración irregular, incluso quienes no votaron por Trump y, con razón, levantan la voz ante los excesos de los días pasados.\nEl reciente intercambio entre el presidente del Senado de la República y el senador Eric Schmitt, por ejemplo, es una clara muestra de lo que no debe hacerse. En diplomacia, las palabras tienen consecuencias; y, en este caso, pueden tener un impacto directo en las decisiones políticas, en las calles y en la vida de las personas.\nLa crisis sigue escalando y podría salirse de control. El despliegue de elementos militares, las movilizaciones en cada vez más ciudades y la confrontación directa entre manifestantes y autoridades han creado una mezcla explosiva cuyas consecuencias podrían ser desastrosas.\nFrente a esa realidad, México no sólo debe activar todos sus mecanismos de protección consular y mantener el diálogo diplomático de alto nivel, también debe actuar estratégicamente: fortalecer las capacidades de los consulados, desplegar campañas de comunicación permanentes, hacer alianzas con organizaciones civiles y actores clave. En pocas palabras: articular una respuesta de Estado.\nEs urgente subir el nivel de las acciones en el exterior y bajar el nivel de la retórica en el interior. No por sumisión, sino por responsabilidad. Nuestras paisanas y paisanos no necesitan discursos, provocaciones ni ocurrencias. Necesitan la solidaridad de su país a través de sus instituciones.\nLa presidenta Sheinbaum ha buscado actuar con seriedad y responsabilidad frente a esta crisis sin precedente. Ojalá que sus funcionarios y correligionarios dejen atrás las poses ideológicas para priorizar acciones concretas que garanticen la seguridad y la integridad de la comunidad mexicana en EU.\nDiputada federal",
