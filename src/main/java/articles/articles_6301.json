    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Mumbai, Dec 24 (IANS) Getting bundled out for 219 after electing to bat and allowing India to score 91/1 at the end of the first day of the match pushed Australia Women on the back foot, Australia captain Alyssa Healy said on Sunday.\nIndia defeated Australia by eight wickets on the fourth and final day of the match reaching 75/2 in their second innings after bowling out the visitors for 261 in 15.4 overs on the fourth morning, with off-spinner Sneh Rana bagging 4-63 and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Rajeshwari Gayakwad claiming a couple each.\n\"We knew it was going to be a tough ask but I'm really proud of our group and the fight that we showed. At the end of the day, I think we had probably 1 bad day of cricket which will cost you in a four-day game of cricket. But All in all a really enjoyable experience. I thoroughly enjoyed it,\" Healy said in the post-match press conference on Sunday.\nIndia had bundled out the top team in women's cricket for 219 with pacer Pooja Vastrakar making the early impact with 4-53 and Sneh Rana contributing 3-56 in the first innings. The hosts then rode on half-centuries by Deepti Sharma (789), Smriti Mandhana (74), Jemimah Rodrigues (73) and debutante Richa Ghosh (52) to post 406 and take a 187-run lead in the first innings.\nThe Australian skipper said the Australians believed that they could win the match even on the final day with just 46 runs ahead with five wickets in hand.\n\"I don't think at any point (that the match has gone out of hand), probably only when Smriti Mandahana hit a six on the last ball.\n\"I think even coming in today, all results were possible. I think we truly believe that in the changeroom. I think if we had batted for about 30-40 overs this morning and even put, you know, over 100, maybe 150 on the board, things could have been really interesting this afternoon.\"\nHealy said her team went on the back foot after the first day itself as they batted and bowled poorly to concede an advantage to India.\n\"So look at the end of the day, like I said, I think we had one bad day. I think when we won the toss, we batted and got bowled out on that first day and then probably leaked 90 runs in the afternoon, it makes things really challenging for us. We're almost on the back foot on the first day.\nThe 33-year-old from Queensland, who was leading the team in her first Test since taking over from Meg Lanning and coming back from an injury break, said she was happy with the way her team fought back in the match.\n\"So from my point of view, the fact that we fought for the next 2 1/2 days and got the game to the position that it was this afternoon, I think it was a huge effort from our group and one that we can take a big, big lot of confidence out of,\" she added.\nAsked whether they went wrong with their bowling after being bowled out cheaply in the first innings, Healy said they probably did not bowl the right lengths against the Indian openers on the first day.\n\"Oh yeah, like I said, I think getting bowled out in the afternoon of that first day and then letting them get to a none-for-90 start was obviously not ideal. I think we probably just didn't adjust to our lengths quickly enough. We probably gave them a bit too much to hit early on that first day, which put us on the back foot quite early.\n\"So in terms of the captaincy side of thing, yeah, I'm, still coming to grips with it. I mean I myself have only played seven Test matches I think, so you wouldn't see too many captains sitting here that have played that little Test matches in the men's game,\" said Healy.\n--IANS\nbsk/bc\nMENAFN24122023000231011071ID1107653106\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "TUCSON, Ariz. (KVOA) —Pima Animal Care Center is looking for people to foster dogs temporarily over the New Year’s holiday. New Years sees an influx of pets when fireworks stress out animals which often causes them to run away. In early 2023, PACC took in 310 pets in the week following New Year’s. PACC hopes that short term fosters will help alleviate the influx. PACC is currently home to more than 465 dogs, placing the shelter beyond critical capacity. “The number of dogs in the shelter usually increases by about 50 in the week following New Year’s,” said Dangler. “By taking a pet home for even a short period, you can help both the dog you take home and the dog – or dogs – that fill that kennel next.” Those interested in fostering a dog for the holiday can pick up beginning Dec. 28 through Dec. 31. No pre-registration is needed; fosters can simply come to PACC to pick up any time during operating hours. Food, toys, blankets, and bowls are available from the foster office if needed, and anyone who commits to a minimum of a week will be entered in a raffle to win prizes. Returns will be scheduled beginning Jan. 8. If fosters decide they want to adopt or keep the pet as a long-term foster, PACC staff will be happy to help facilitate. PACC is located at 4000 N. Silverbell Road and is open on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from noon to 7 p.m., on Wednesday from 1:30 – 7 p.m., and on weekends from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The shelter will be open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on New Year’s Eve and closed on New Year’s Day.

    "text": "“There’s no bigger Leslie County Legend than Tim Couch”: Tim Couch statue coming to Leslie County HYDEN, Ky. (WYMT) - 25 years after being taken first overall in the 1999 NFL draft, some Leslie County faithful are working on a project to honor the star Eagles quarterback with a life-size statue. The idea was made by Allen Rice, the creator of The Eagles Nest, an alumni club designed to preserve the history, promote the present, and inspire the future of Leslie County. Rice said the goal is to get kids back in touch with the heritage of the program. “Being around the teams and the younger kids and seeing that they have sort of lost touch with their heritage, the past and the rich tradition we have here,” Rice said. “We wanted a way to preserve that and one of our favorite segments on our shows is Leslie County Legends. There’s no bigger Leslie County Legend than Tim Couch.” The statue is funded solely by the Eagles Nest and private donors. Rice said the impact of Tim Couch stretches far beyond Leslie County. “It’s a big deal,” Rice said. “Not just for Leslie County but all of eastern Kentucky and Kentucky as a whole.” While he is honored to be a part of it, Rice said the statue is not about him. “It’s not about me, it’s about our kids, Rice said. “That’s the one thing that we try to push harder than anything ... It’s very special because the bar is set so high.” Allen Rice’s brother, Jerry Rice, said it’s important to honor one of the only first-overall picks to come out of Eastern Kentucky. “You can’t really fathom being from a small town and having somebody like that come through here,” Jerry Rice said. “We just wanted to do something for him so our youth and our future generations can look at that and say that they can reach those dreams and goals the same way Tim did and nothing’s too big even when you come from a small town.” One of Tim’s high school teammates, Landry Collett, said it’s a special moment to honor a teammate and lifelong friend. “It’s unreal,” Collett said. “When Allen came and mentioned it I was like, wow that’s the coolest thing I ever heard. To see it come to fruition and to happen for the community I think is going to be a great thing for everybody.” The statue is just one of the many things the Eagles Nest does to preserve the history of Leslie County. “I truly feel like it is pulling everybody back into the community a little bit more,” cameraman Dalton Spurlock said. “I feel like it’s a great thing.” The Eagles Nest is currently working on finding a good place on the school’s campus for the statue and what the pose of the statue will be. The unveiling of the statue will happen during the 2024 football season. Copyright 2024 WYMT. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Entrevista a Paul Berman: “Hamás toma mucho prestado del ideario nazi”",
    "text": "Tras los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001, el escritor y periodista neoyorquino Paul Berman analizó el terror islamista en Terror y libertad (Tusquets, 2007). El ensayo, que pronto figuró en la lista de libros más vendidos de The New York Times, mostraba claramente cómo el islamismo radical está vinculado al totalitarismo europeo. Además del fascismo y el comunismo, a la hidra le había crecido otra cabeza: la islamista. Por teléfono desde Nueva York, el intelectual judío explica cómo el terror de Hamás confirma esa imagen.\nEl ataque terrorista de Hamás se ve como un ataque a Israel. ¿Pero no debería verse en un contexto más amplio? ¿No es el 7 de octubre comparable al 11 de septiembre o a los atentados islamistas de París en 2015?\nCreo que tiene razón. Me parece un error interpretar a Hamás solo como un movimiento nacionalista local. El establecimiento de un Estado palestino convencional no satisfaría sus demandas.\nPiensa más allá.\nSí, forma parte de un movimiento islamista internacionalista más amplio. El objetivo último del islamismo es establecer un determinado tipo de islam en el mundo musulmán y más allá. No olvidemos tampoco que Hamás interpreta el sionismo como una conspiración mundial contra el islam, no solo como una cuestión local. Eso significa que la lucha de Hamás tiene obligatoriamente una dimensión mundial.\nEl terror islamista se basa a menudo en atentados suicidas. ¿Fue diferente el atentado de Hamás? ¿O es que los terroristas no esperaban salir con vida?\nDe hecho, el atentado se llevó a cabo en la modalidad de una operación suicida. Y no estoy seguro de que realmente sobrevivieran muchos atacantes. Pero es difícil dar con cifras exactas.\n¿Cómo se determina que fue una operación suicida?\nSolo hay que ver cómo procedió Hamás. Los atacantes llegaron a un kibutz, entraron en las casas y permanecieron allí durante muchas horas hasta que apareció el ejército israelí, entonces hubo una batalla. Si hubieran querido sobrevivir, no se habrían quedado, habrían matado al mayor número posible de personas lo antes posible. Luego se habrían retirado a Gaza. Pero se quedaron. Así que vemos una característica del terrorismo islamista cuyo objetivo principal es causar masacres…\nSe trata explícitamente de violencia…\nSí, y el segundo objetivo es permitir que los terroristas mueran como mártires. Aunque nos cueste entenderlo. Los atentados suicidas nos parecen irracionales. Por ejemplo, el 11 de septiembre, el ataque terrorista cogió a Estados Unidos completamente por sorpresa porque nadie podía imaginar un ataque tan irracional.\n¿Ocurrió algo parecido en Israel?\nEs un asunto complicado. El ejército israelí no solo se enfrenta a Hamás desde que se produjeron los ataques. Conoce la naturaleza de su ideología. Creo que el problema es que hay dos tipos de guerra: la guerra convencional, en la que ambas partes tienen una idea similar de la muerte, y la otra guerra, en la que una de las partes no comparte esa idea.\n¿Israel subestimó el fatalismo del enemigo?\nLos israelíes pensaban que habían establecido algún tipo de lenguaje para comunicarse con Hamás. Hamás comete un acto terrible y los israelíes toman represalias. Saben que pueden bombardear esto o aquello, pero no más. Porque eso rompería el acuerdo implícito. Durante varios años, el pueblo israelí pensó que Hamás había emprendido esta forma de guerra comparativamente poco complicada.\nSe descuidaron…\nSí, incluso Netanyahu, que siempre se ha presentado como el hombre inteligente que entiende lo fundamentalistas que son estos movimientos dirigidos contra Israel.\n¿Ha olvidado que Hamás tiene una idea diferente de la muerte?\nVerá, Hitler también tenía una idea diferente de la muerte. Hitler no quería obligar a sus enemigos a ponerse de acuerdo, quería exterminar a sus enemigos. Al final, él y todos los altos cargos del Partido Nacionalsocialista se suicidaron. Así que quería que sus enemigos murieran, y si ellos no morían, quería que murieran él y los que le rodeaban. Y eso no está tan lejos de la idea de Hamás. Hamás toma mucho prestado del idearioi.\n¿Puede aclarar eso?\nHamás es una rama de los Hermanos Musulmanes de Egipto. Los Hermanos Musulmanes, que surgieron en la década de 1930 como un movimiento fundamentalista islámico de renovación, se convirtieron en un movimiento de masas que absorbió una serie de ideas europeas. Mussolini y Hitler querían “limpiar” la sociedad y resucitar el Imperio romano a su manera. Hasán al-Banna, el fundador de los Hermanos Musulmanes, fantaseaba con purgas similares y quería revivir el Imperio islámico del profeta Mahoma.\nTomó prestado de los fascistas…\nHasán al-Banna admiraba a Hitler en particular y promovió un culto a la muerte al estilo de Hitler. “El martirio en el camino de Dios es nuestra mayor esperanza” era el lema de Al-Banna. Pero el mayor teórico de los Hermanos Musulmanes fue Sayyid Qutb, que también resultó ser un estudioso del romanticismo inglés. Qutb profundizó las ideas de la Hermandad, cultural y psicológicamente. Y reunió todo eso en su pensamiento sobre los judíos.\n¿Cómo era ese pensamiento?\nUn documento central del antisemitismo europeo son los falsificados Protocolos de los sabios de Sion, que postulan una conspiración judía nefasta para dominar el mundo. Los Protocolos eran uno de los textos preferidos de Hitler, y el gobierno alemán los distribuyó traducidos al árabe entre los países árabes de la época. Qutb los adoptó para formular su propia teoría conspirativa del mal judío, según la cual los judíos empezaron a conspirar contra el islam en Medina en el siglo VII y siguieron haciéndolo hasta los tiempos modernos, con la intención de destruir el islam.\n¿Así que el pensamiento nazi se filtró en los movimientos islamistas?\nSí, Qutb, los Hermanos Musulmanes y sus correligionarios entre los palestinos llegaron a una concepción del mal judío que no estaba arraigada en el islam. En el islam tradicional, los judíos desempeñan un papel diferente, no el de una religión todopoderosa y temible. La idea de que los judíos son omnipotentes y aterradores es una idea europea.\n¿Por qué esta idea es importante en relación con Hamás?\nHamás ha adoptado estas concepciones por completo. Puede verse en su carta fundacional de 1988. La carta comienza con una cita del Corán, seguida de un comentario de Al-Banna sobre la eliminación de Israel y, a continuación, sin citarlo, presenta un análisis cultural y psicológico que parece proceder de Qutb. Lo que cita la carta de Hamás son los Protocolos de los sabios de Sion.\nEl odio a los judíos se declara abiertamente.\nEn el artículo siete, la carta llama al exterminio de los judíos. Hoy se dice que Hamás es una respuesta a las cosas terribles que Israel ha hecho a los palestinos desde 1948. Pero las ideas mencionadas no son de 1948, sino una mezcla infernal de fundamentalismo islámico e ideologías nazis de los años treinta y cuarenta, que Qutb y otros bastardearon en años posteriores, antes de que Hamás las adoptara a finales de los ochenta.\n¿Eso significa que la ideología de Hamás no es una respuesta a la violencia israelí?\nNo, la ideología de Hamás es, en esencia, una doctrina preisraelí. Es una causa de la violencia, no una respuesta a ella. Los cientos de miles judíos del mundo árabe y musulmán que han huido a Israel han huido precisamente de esta doctrina. Sin embargo, esta percepción parece haberse perdido porque la gente no quiere aceptar que esas doctrinas, esas ideologías, puedan ser la causa de la violencia.\nUsted escribió hace veinte años sobre los atentados suicidas en Israel en aquella época. Se dio cuenta de que la popularidad de la causa palestina aumentaba a pesar de los atentados terroristas. Hoy observamos el mismo fenómeno.\nA gran escala, sí. Este entusiasmo de la gente por el espectáculo de un pogromo masivo contra los judíos, esta excitación y agitación: es indescriptible por impactante.\nEn su momento señalaron que cada acto de terror se tomaba como prueba de lo malvados que debían ser los israelíes.\nEs una lógica retorcida: cuanto más flagrante es el terror, mayor debe ser la culpabilidad de los israelíes. Sí, la idea es: ¿qué llevó a los asesinos a cometer estas horribles masacres? Debieron hacerles algo terrible. Y por eso siempre oímos hablar de las cosas terribles que les hicieron a los palestinos. Por supuesto, así fue. Pero se hicieron cosas terribles a mucha gente.\n¿Se queda corta esta idea?\nHamás ha abrazado abiertamente una ideología de racismo y genocidio. Pero mucha gente no quiere abandonar su idea de que el mundo es un lugar donde hay causas y efectos simples. Y las causas en esta cosmovisión son siempre materiales. Nunca son ideológicas.\nAhora vemos que la gente sigue pensando así.\nY seguirán haciéndolo. La gente es ciega a la ideología que está en juego aquí. Lo vemos en los medios de comunicación, que a menudo son ingenuos. Se ve en los izquierdistas radicales, pero también en personas razonables que no quieren aceptar este pensamiento ideológico. Por eso encuentra muy poca resistencia. Desde el 11 de septiembre de 2001 apenas se han hecho progresos, lo que es realmente inquietante.\nNo tiene mucha esperanza.\nNo, no tengo muchas esperanzas. ~\nTraducción del alemán de Daniel Gascón.\nPublicado originalmente en el periódico suizo Neue Zürcher Zeitung.",

    "title": "Rising energy costs drive surge in solar power adoption",
    "text": "Rising energy prices and frequent outages are driving the increased adoption of solar power among households and businesses. As of 2023, the 630MW installed solar power capacity accounted for only 1.4% of the total installed energy capacity in Pakistan. Power sector regulator, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), projects that the nation’s photovoltaic capacity will increase dramatically to 12.8 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, and an astounding 26.9GW by 2047. This ambitious trajectory suggests a strong and accelerating shift to solar power. Talking to WealthPK, Rafiullah Shams, Manager at RS Solar Solution, a green energy solution provider, said the adoption of solar power systems had increased due to growing household expenses incurred on the costly fuel-based electricity. “A growing number of households opt for solar installations as a sustainable and affordable alternative to conventional energy sources because they are getting more expensive and unstable.” He highlighted that the substantial initial investments in solar panels were seen as a wise financial move, given the long-term savings on electricity bills and the decreasing costs of solar technology. “This trend is reflective of a global shift towards renewable energy, particularly in countries like Pakistan, which are faced with ongoing energy challenges.” It is worth mentioning that Pakistan had 117,807 net metering-based solar installations with a cumulative capacity of 1,822MW as of March 2024. This remarkable increase demonstrates how Pakistani households have begun to accept and use solar energy more and more. “To support this shift, the government must implement policies that not only address the high cost of electricity but also promote the adoption of renewable energy sources. An important policy advice is to start providing tax breaks and subsidies for solar energy installations.” Shams said another crucial policy step could be restructuring electricity tariffs to ensure they truly reflect the cost of production to shield customers from exorbitant bills. “Implementing a tiered pricing structure, where lower rates are applied to basic consumption levels and higher rates for excess usage, could help manage energy costs more effectively.” Talking to WealthPK, Faraz Khan, an energy expert at the Pakistan-German Renewable Energy Forum, said that people could produce their electricity while transferring excess power back into the grid via the net metering system. “This is an effective way to reduce excessive energy bills and potentially profit from surplus generation.” He pointed out that the solar industry’s growth was demonstrated by the rising number of certified installers, which had surpassed 400. “This growth in the solar energy ecosystem indicates industry’s growth and increasing trust in solar technology.” “More licensed installers mean that regulatory standards are met for installation quality, which is essential to preserving the reliability and effectiveness of solar power systems,” he underscored. Khan suggested the government stimulate wider adoption of solar energy by lowering the costs for consumers. “Eliminating import taxes on batteries and solar panel components would reduce prices and promote the expansion of the solar industry.” “The government should allocate funds to modernise the energy infrastructure to minimise transmission losses and boost effectiveness. This will improve the overall reliability of the energy supply in addition to bringing down the price of electricity,” emphasised the energy expert.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
