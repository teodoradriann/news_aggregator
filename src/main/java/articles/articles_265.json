    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Sustainable technology: Towards a greener future",
    "text": "Satyabrat Borah\n(satyabratborah12@gmail.com)\nAs the whole world is desperately searching for some way to combat climate change and resource consumption, sustainable technology is emerging as a foundation for building a greener, more flexible future. Sustainable technology refers to innovations designed to reduce environmental impact, conserve resources, and encourage long-term ecological balance. These technologies address pressing challenges such as carbon emissions, energy efficiency, and waste management, ensuring that economic growth is in harmony with environmental preservation.\nThe global reliance on technology has led to increased energy demands and resource consumption. Sustainable technologies aim to mitigate these issues by reducing the ecological footprint of operations across industries. By implementing these innovations, businesses can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, minimise waste, and enhance their overall energy efficiency. This approach not only helps the planet but also generates significant cost savings for organisations in the long run. Sustainable technology plays a crucial role in achieving global climate goals. As countries push toward net-zero emissions, integrating technologies that promote energy efficiency and reduce pollution will be pivotal in slowing down the impact of global warming.\nA critical component of sustainable technology is the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower. These sources not only reduce dependence on carbon-intensive fuels but also help countries and industries meet emission reduction targets. Solar energy has seen significant advancements in photovoltaic cells, making it more affordable and scalable for both businesses and households. Innovations like smart grids are revolutionising the way electricity is distributed and consumed. These grids allow for better management of energy demand, which reduces waste and ensures efficient distribution of electricity from renewable sources.\nData centres are becoming significant contributors to global energy consumption. Companies are also adopting green computing practices that prioritise energy-efficient hardware, software optimisation, and sustainable cooling solutions.\nData centres are increasingly powered by renewable energy sources by reducing their carbon footprint. Companies such as Google and Amazon Web Services have committed to running their data centres on 100% renewable energy and also implemented AI-driven cooling systems to minimise energy use. The linear economy model of “take, make, and dispose” is replaced by a more sustainable circular economy framework. This approach prioritised reusing, repairing, and recycling products and materials, particularly in the technology sector, where e-waste is a growing concern.\nTech giants are now adopting sustainable manufacturing practices by designing products that are easier to recycle and reuse. Companies are also offering buy-back and recycling programs for old devices. Companies are trying to reduce e-waste and ensure valuable materials are recovered and repurposed.\nTechnology is playing a transformative role in making agriculture more sustainable. Precision farming technologies, such as drones and IoT sensors, enable farmers to optimise water usage, reduce pesticide application, and improve crop yields. Vertical farming and lab-grown meat are reducing the need for arable land and decreasing methane emissions from livestock farming.\nThese innovations are essential for addressing the challenges of feeding a growing global population and minimising environmental damage from traditional agricultural practices.\nCities around the world are integrating sustainable technologies to reduce their carbon footprints and improve the quality of life for their residents. Smart cities use technologies such as IoT-enabled street lighting, electric vehicle infrastructure, and energy-efficient buildings in order to reduce energy consumption and emissions. Green architecture emphasises materials that are environmentally friendly, such as recycled steel, bamboo, and low-impact concrete, in building design. Innovations in insulation, heating, and cooling systems also help to minimise energy use in both residential and commercial properties.\nSustainable technology is not just an environmental imperative; it is also a key driver of economic growth. Adopting green technologies can lead to reduced operating costs, especially in energy-intensive sectors like manufacturing and transportation. Companies that embrace sustainability are increasingly seen as attractive to consumers, investors, and employees who prioritise environmental responsibility. Studies show that businesses with strong sustainability initiatives often outperform their peers in terms of financial returns. For instance, the Gartner 2024 report highlights that by 2027, 80% of CIOs will have performance metrics tied to the sustainability of their IT operations, underscoring how central sustainability is becoming to business successes.\nThough the adoption of sustainable technology is growing, there are still challenges to overcome. High upfront costs, lack of infrastructure, and policy barriers can impede the widespread implementation of green technologies. But as of now, governments, corporations, and consumers increasingly recognise the need for sustainability; the demand for supportive policies, investments in research and development, and educational initiatives will continue to grow. Sustainable technology is more than a trend. It is a necessity for a future that balances economic growth with environmental preservation. If we will continue to innovate in areas such as renewable energy, smart infrastructure, and resource efficiency, we can build a world that not only thrives today but also secures the well-being of future generations.",

    "text": "MIRPUR, Feb 19 (APP):Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Minister for Information Maulana Pir Muhammad Mazhar Saeed Shah Wednesday strongly condemned the confiscation of Islamic and history books and property of Kashmiris by the occupying Indian forces in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) state. He said, in a statement, the nefarious attempt by Indian extremists to erase the history and culture of Kashmir will not succeed. The Minister stated that after the unconstitutional, illegal and sinister action of 5th August 2019, India was continuously exercising such heinous acts targeting Kashmiri Muslims in IIOJK He expressed that under the agenda of the Indian extremist ruling RSS, India is imposing a Hindutva-based curriculum in schools to erase the identity of Muslims, change their history, and mislead the new generation of Jammu and Kashmir. Maulana Shah appealed to global human rights organizations and institutions to take notice of this brutality and extremism of India. The Kashmiri leader further added that India was the mastermind of terrorism in this region, the peace of the entire region was at stake due to the continual nefarious tactics of India in IIOJK targeting innocent Kashmiris.",

    "title": "Resisting Physician-Assisted Death Is a Gospel Imperative",
    "text": "One of the most poignant suicide notes I’ve read was written by Gillian Bennett. A brilliant and articulate woman, and a trained psychotherapist, she was diagnosed with dementia and began to experience the resulting limitations, weakness, and frailty. She decided to end her own life to avoid experiencing further decline. She wrote about her decision on a dedicated website. The story of her death and her reasons for choosing it were widely discussed in the media. Her words help us to understand the perspective of a patient seeking physician-assisted death: I will take my life today around noon. It is time. Dementia is taking its toll and I have nearly lost myself. I have nearly lost me. . . . Understand that I am giving up nothing that I want by committing suicide. All I lose is an indefinite number of years of being a vegetable in a hospital setting, eating up the country’s money but having not the faintest idea of who I am. Each of us is born uniquely and dies uniquely. I think of dying as a final adventure with a predictably abrupt end. I know when it’s time to leave and I do not find it scary. According to the website, Gillian Bennett died at 11 a.m. on August 18, 2014, in the presence of her husband. News of her death, and her poignant declaration of her reasons for ending her life, contributed to the growing public support for physician-assisted death. Within a year of her death, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the criminal code prohibiting physician-assisted death. By 2022, 4.1 percent of all deaths in Canada were physician-assisted. How do we respond to people like Gillian who find no reason to go on, who want life to be over, and who want to control the manner and timing of their deaths? Given this “why,” which seems so intuitive and plausible in our present social milieu, is there a reasonable “why not”? Wealthy, White, Nonreligious Suicides A consistent finding from studies of patients who seek euthanasia is that they’re generally from a specific group in society: wealthy, white, nonreligious people. This observation is sometimes cited in support of physician-assisted death because it’s taken to mean these patients aren’t from so-called vulnerable or marginalized populations. They aren’t being taken advantage of or forced to obtain physician-assisted death. They aren’t vulnerable to coercion. Nobody is making them choose this path. But are we failing to understand the true nature of vulnerability? What if vulnerability to physician-assisted death arises from within rather than from external social forces? What if people lack the resources offered by spiritual beliefs and community to make sense out of suffering and to transcend it? What if vulnerability isn’t social but rather psychological and spiritual? The fact that a specific group of people is predisposed to seek physician-assisted death raises the distinct possibility that existential, philosophical, and spiritual concerns—problems of meaning and significance in the face of suffering and loss—are key factors that help explain why people seek death from a doctor. Decide Your Own Value Proponents of physician-assisted death claim to care greatly about human value. They insist that physician-assisted death is a matter of respect for intrinsic value and autonomy. Intrinsic value rises from the thing itself. By regarding a person as the source of his or her own value, the person appears to be accorded deep significance and importance. After all, isn’t this “value from inside”? On the contrary, physician-assisted death doesn’t affirm the intrinsic value of humanity, because it’s based on a sense of value conditional on someone’s self-regard. In fact, it requires viewing humans as having extrinsic value, which comes from the valuer’s opinion. When we treat ourselves as the foundation of our own value, we force ourselves to bear an unbearable weight. If we’re in a situation where we’re unable or unwilling to value ourselves, then we lose our value. If we’re of no use to ourselves, then we really are useless. If I feel my existence is bad for me, then it really is bad to exist. By contrast, if I had intrinsic value, I’d be obligated as “valuer” to value myself. But if I don’t have such intrinsic value, then I’m under no obligation to value myself, and I’m free to do with myself as I please, no matter how self-destructive my choices might be. True Value We’re too weak, too frail, too vulnerable to circumstances for our self-regard to be a firm foundation for our value and significance. And this is a burden we need not bear, for God tells us how valuable we are over and over (Ps. 139; Isa. 43:4; Matt. 6:26; 10:29–31; John 3:16). Yet the tragedy of the human condition is that we’re prone to forget how much we matter. We’re too weak, too frail, too vulnerable to circumstances to be a firm foundation for our value and significance. One important way we remember our intrinsic value is through community. When others treat us as if we’re deeply valuable (e.g., kind wishes from friends and family on our birthday), we feel ourselves to be valuable. If we’re ignored, neglected, or forgotten, we quickly doubt our value. Unless we enjoy respect and dignified treatment from others, we’re inclined to feel worthless. This is the essence of loving community, seen so clearly in the local church. It’s a web of value in action. Solution to Despair Physician-assisted death is held up as a solution to the problem of suffering; at bottom, it’s a solution to despair. And the solution is to end the person who’s in despair. We know a better way. The gospel offers us deep, durable meaning—powerful enough to sustain us through life and through suffering and dying. Our story becomes part of God’s grand story, the story behind all stories. It’s the story in which our suffering is shown to be for good, to be meaningful, to matter, to be worth it. And it’s a happily-ever-after story, a too-good-to-be-true story, a story of faith, hope, and love that culminates in eternal life and everlasting communion with the One who made us for himself. In the kingdom, we discover that God himself is our highest good. In the kingdom, we discover a meaning for our suffering that makes it all worth it. In the kingdom, our suffering isn’t useless. In the kingdom, there’s no despair. The gospel offers us deep, durable meaning—powerful enough to sustain us through life and through suffering and dying. So how should we respond? The church can head off physician-assisted death in our congregations by discipling Christians to suffer well. We must equip believers with the theological, philosophical, and spiritual resources to face suffering, to endure hardness. Our teaching should anticipate suffering, illness, and death. Those of us privileged to live in democratic societies must ask our elected officials to oppose this practice and to uphold freedom of conscience for healthcare professionals who refuse to participate. A nation’s laws are a teacher. Legalizing physician-assisted death teaches our society to doubt human value and to see it as merely extrinsic and conditional. Prohibiting this practice reminds us of the true depth of human value. Protecting freedom of conscience allows professionals in healthcare facilities to provide safety for those living with disabilities or chronic illness who see themselves as vulnerable to the suggestion of death.
