    "title": "I Used to Be Resilient. What Happened?",
    "text": "I’ve noticed I am becoming less resilient as I age. Insults used to bounce off me; I could move to a new city at the drop of a hat. Now I stew for days about a social media slight and can barely change my hair without fretting.\nIt’s a flaw — one I want to help my young son avoid by exposing him to challenges that will help him confront adversity without melting down. I know it’s hypocritical — the very essence of “do as I say, not as I do.” Before I raise a resilient kid, I should probably raise a resilient me.\nI have my coping mechanisms: Intense exercise, getting out into nature or distracting my brain with a Rubik’s Cube can all keep me from spinning out. But these feel like Band-Aids, not real grit.\nSo I called a few experts to find out how I can become tougher. What I discovered was that my view of resilience was all wrong.\nWait, what is resilience again? Defining resilience is tricky. Some frame it as the ability to stand up to adversity; others describe it as an ability to bounce back; still others liken it to adaptability.\nWords like grit and positivity get thrown around a lot, too. But these terms suggest a sort of tough-guy stiff upper lip that doesn’t often work in the long term, said Michael Ungar, a professor of social work at Dalhousie University in Canada and expert in resilience. Instead, he said, it’s multiple “processes that will make it possible for you to thrive under stress.”\nSo, rather than a single muscle you can exercise, resilience is the product of many parts of your life, experience and personality.\nFine, but how do I get it? All of the experts I spoke with agreed that, no matter how you define it, resilience can be improved, just like physical strength. There are many foundations that can support it — family, spirituality or money, for example — though three ideas are central to better resilience.\nIdentify what brings you meaning. “The biggest piece of a good life is having some kind of sense of purpose and something that you’re invested in and committed to,” said Sherry Hamby, a psychology professor at the University of the South in Tennessee who studies resilience in impoverished communities.\nShe has found that the most powerful predictor of resilience to traumatic events is your connection to something larger than your self, whether it’s God, family, country or just the local P.T.A.\nThe more types of meaning you find, the more stable you are. For instance, say you define yourself as a mother, a teacher and an artist. If you lose your teaching job, you can draw strength from your family and your art.\nSo how do you rediscover meaning in your life?\nFind a way to tell your story, Dr. Hamby said, and your values will become clear. Record a message to your children , do a life review or write your own obituary. Start with the accomplishments you are most proud of, and then go through the impacts you have made and what you will leave behind. Think about what you have yet to do.\nUnderstand that no one is an island. “We as humans are very social creatures,” said Kathryn Howell, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “So when bad things happen to us, we want to be together and connected to others.”\nCommunity is crucial to resilience. One way to build a social circle , the experts agreed, is by volunteering. Go back to the things that give you purpose, Dr. Ungar said. If you find meaning in literature, volunteer at a library. If you don’t connect with the people there, try teaching pottery or joining a running group. The point isn’t to be constantly social , but to build a community.\nFind what keeps you balanced. It turns out the kinds of tools I thought were crucial for resilience — breathing techniques, exercise, time in nature — are further down the list. Self-regulation methods can calm you down or help you through the day, experts say, but they can’t always carry you through a crisis.\nTake a hard look at yourself. So how can I improve my middling resilience? I do have meaning in my life as a father and a journalist. And I have the mountains and forests around where I live to give me balance.\nBut I don’t have a strong social circle, especially with other men . So my path to resilience isn’t about braving the elements or collecting tools to give me grit. It’s about having humility and making time to reach out and ask someone to, I don’t know, get a beer sometime.\nAre you dreading September? If you imagine a calendar year like a workweek, then August is a “lazy, delicious, fretful Sunday,” writes Elizabeth Angell. And September is our Monday, when it’s time to get back to work. Dreading reality? We have ways to make the transition easier.\nRead the article: Do You Have a Case of the ‘September Scaries’?\nA final message from Dr. Ruth In her later years, America’s most famous sex therapist pivoted from talking about sex to talking about another topic that is often shrouded in shame: loneliness. Her final book, out next week, focuses on how to strengthen connections with others.\nRead the article: 5 Ways to Feel More Connected, According to Dr. Ruth\nThe Week in Well Here are some stories you don’t want to miss:\n“ Do not resuscitate ” orders can be confusing and are often ignored by medical professionals, Kate Raphael finds.\nThe popular weight loss drug Zepbound is getting a price cut and an alternative packaging, Dani Blum reports.\nThe California Senate passed a bill to ban food dyes in schools. Some scientists believe such ingredients can affect children’s behavior, Alice Callahan explains.\nHow does wildfire smoke affect our health ? Jane C. Hu looks into what we know and don’t know.\nThe return to school means contagious bugs and tummy aches .

    "text": "The United States, in recent years, has been struggling with [a supply shortage of critical materials](https://www.globaltrademag.com/supply-chain-shortages-and-their-impact-on-manufacturing/) needed for advanced materials discovery and manufacturing. Widespread delays have impacted sectors ranging from the defense sector to the industrial technology domain. A deep reliance on overseas sources sheds light on vulnerabilities in the global material supply chain and introduces roadblocks to the development of new materials, innovative manufacturing solutions and commercialization. With these challenges in mind, [Lenore Dai](https://search.asu.edu/profile/1260435), a professor of chemical engineering and the vice dean of faculty administration in the [Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering](http://engineering.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University, is leading an interdisciplinary team to optimize the use of artificial intelligence tools and machine learning models in fundamental materials research. The project is a collaboration with researchers at the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/) and [Brewer Science,](https://www.brewerscience.com/) a microelectronics materials manufacturer. “This collaborative effort is a perfect example of why Arizona State University is committed to conducting research of public value,” says ASU President Michael Crow. “Embracing the use of AI and machine learning as mechanisms for advancing research in a way that leads to important advances in manufacturing processes is the kind of impact we seek to have in the work we do at ASU. This is fantastic progress by Dr. Dai, and we are excited to be a part of the team that is making it happen.” University of Missouri President Mun Choi says, “I am so pleased that our world-class faculty researchers are partnering with distinguished colleagues at ASU and Brewer Science on groundbreaking AI and materials science research. This innovative collaboration continues our incredible momentum while meeting a critical need for our nation.” Dai is the principal investigator for a new contract with the [Engineer Research and Development Center](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/) (ERDC) of the [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers](https://www.usace.army.mil/) called Accelerate Materials Design and Process Optimization through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Leaders from the ERDC emphasize the significance of the new collaboration, highlighting how AI and machine learning will revolutionize materials science research and innovation. “We’re excited to get this new partnership underway between Arizona State University, the University of Missouri, Brewer Science and ERDC,” says Robert Moser, director of the ERDC’s Information Technology Laboratory. “The nexus of materials science and artificial intelligence is an important one that can shape a range of applications of interest to ERDC and the Army. I’m looking forward to seeing the outcomes from this impactful work and expert team.” Edmond Russo, director of the Environmental Laboratory at the ERDC, says, “Artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming how we discover new materials by allowing us to quickly analyze complex scientific data to find materials with the exact properties we need. I’m excited about this project because it not only uses advanced AI techniques but also brings together the expertise of Arizona State University, the University of Missouri and Brewer Science. This partnership enhances our skills in AI and machine learning for optimizing materials and automating labs, helping us innovate faster in materials science.” The project will focus on using AI and machine learning to enhance the development of new materials and optimize manufacturing processes. It will advance the design and discovery of novel materials systems using large language models, or LLMs, to assist with generating hypotheses and integrating novel experimentally validated computational tools for materials discovery, design and manufacturing. “AI tools, such as LLMs like ChatGPT, can be used for accelerating scientific research and covering a wide range of knowledge that is challenging for a single human to obtain. However, there is a high error rate associated with LLMs, which have issues such as hallucination,” Dai says. “One of our goals is to develop prompting and fine-tuned methodologies and software modules to significantly reduce these errors.” Additionally, the team will integrate novel experimentally validated machine learning models that carefully investigate whether the specific learning architecture is appropriate to capture the physical causal relations across key chemical, microstructural and physical features in materials design and development processes. “The work that Professor Dai and her team is doing highlights the innovative use of AI in ways that matter to industry and the public,” says [Kyle Squires](https://search.asu.edu/profile/94222), senior vice provost of engineering, computing and technology at ASU and dean of the Fulton Schools. “These tools can help researchers accelerate the discovery process, create more agile manufacturing processes and, ultimately, deliver innovations that will transform society.” Dai highlights the expansive scope of the project, emphasizing how collaboration across multiple institutions and sectors amplifies its potential. “It is important to acknowledge the reach and potential this project has as a result of the collaboration with the University of Missouri, Brewer Science and various faculty across disciplines within the Fulton Schools,” Dai says. “This creates the landscape to capture a large audience and produce an incredible impact, which reaches across institutions, private entities and government sectors.” More Science and technology Celebrating '20 Years of Discovery' at ASU’s Biodesign Institute Editor’s note:The Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University continues to celebrate its landmark 20th anniversary with this fifth installment in its \"20 Years of Discovery\" series.

    "title": "Bach desea que París 2024 una en la paz a «un mundo cansado de la hostilidad y del odio» – El Nuevo Diario (República Dominicana)",
    "text": "EL NUEVO DIARIO, MADRID.- El presidente del Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI), Thomas Bach, desea que en el año entrante los Juegos de París 2024 sirvan para «unir en una competición pacífica» a un mundo en el que «la gente está agotada y cansada del antagonismo, la hostilidad y el odio a los que se enfrenta en todos los ámbitos de su vida». En un mensaje de fin de año difundido por el COI, el dirigente alemán aventura que la edición de París abrirá «una nueva era de Juegos Olímpicos: más jóvenes, más inclusivos, más urbanos, más sostenibles» y recuerda que serán los primeros «con plena paridad de género». «Nuestras expectativas para estos Juegos Olímpicos son compartidas por miles de millones de personas. En estos tiempos difíciles que vivimos, la gente de todo el mundo está agotada y cansada del antagonismo, la hostilidad y el odio a los que se enfrenta en todos los ámbitos de su vida», señala Bach. «En el fondo de nuestros corazones, todos anhelamos algo unificador. Algo que nos una, a pesar de nuestras diferencias. Algo que nos dé esperanza. Algo que nos inspire a abordar los problemas de forma pacífica. Algo que saque lo mejor de nosotros. Anhelamos que los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024 unan al mundo entero en una competición pacífica», añade. El COI decidió hace dos semanas autorizar la participación en los Juegos de los deportistas rusos y bielorrusos que aún estén a tiempo de clasificarse, siempre que no hayan apoyado la guerra en Ucrania, pero sin sus símbolos nacionales y bajo la denominación de Deportistas Neutrales Individuales. Los equipos de esos países no serán admitidos. Thomas Bach pide en su mensaje que el Movimiento Olímpico «permanezca unido» y se oponga «a los esfuerzos por fragmentar el deporte mundial en función de criterios políticos». «Más allá de los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024, nos mantenemos unidos en nuestra misión de hacer del mundo un lugar mejor a través del deporte», apunta. Bach opina que la inteligencia artificial (IA) y los deportes electrónicos «ofrecen enormes oportunidades» el Movimiento Olímpico. «Por ello», dice, «la Comisión de eSports del COI está estudiando la creación de unos Juegos Olímpicos de eSports» «Sea cual sea la forma que adopten los Juegos Olímpicos de eSports, nuestros parámetros y condiciones están establecidos. Nos mantendremos fieles a nuestros valores: los valores olímpicos de paz, respeto, no discriminación y solidaridad», subraya. También se compromete a «utilizar el poder transformador de la IA para apoyar a los deportistas e impulsar el desarrollo del deporte». «Se trata de identificar talentos, crear métodos de entrenamiento individualizados, hacer que el arbitraje sea más objetivo y personalizar la experiencia visual individual de miles de millones de aficionados olímpicos.Las oportunidades son ilimitadas y habrá que mitigar los riesgos», señala. Bach concluye su mensaje recordando que París fue la cuna de Pierre de Coubertin, fundador del COI y restaurador de los Juegos, y también es «la Ciudad de la Luz, la Ciudad del Amor y la ciudad de una nueva era de Juegos Olímpicos». Allí espera ver, agrega, «una celebración inolvidable de la alegría del deporte, una celebración de nuestra humanidad compartida».",

    "title": "Former Blizzard CEO thinks rewards should be allowed for game developers – Gamereactor",
    "text": "Former Microsoft and Blizzard executive Mike Ybarra is stirring up conversation in the gaming industry once again with a bold suggestion regarding tipping game developers.\nYbarra, who recently made headlines for his candid social media posts, believes that players should have the option to tip developers for delivering an exceptional gaming experience. In his view, some games are worth more than their original price tag, and players should have the opportunity to show their appreciation financially.\nThis suggestion comes at a time when many gamers are frustrated with the prevalence of microtransactions and season passes in modern gaming. Ybarra argues that a tipping system could incentivize developers to create more complete and engaging experiences without the need for additional purchases.\nWhile Ybarra acknowledges that not everyone may be on board with the concept of tipping, he emphasizes that it would be optional and anonymous. The idea is to reward developers for delivering something truly special, rather than simply maximizing profit.\nThe question now is: would players be willing to pay extra for a game that they feel is worth more than the standard price? Ybarra’s suggestion has sparked debate among gamers, with some expressing support for the idea and others raising concerns about the potential implications.\nAs the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see if Ybarra’s proposal gains traction and influences the way games are monetized in the future. Whether or not tipping developers becomes a widespread practice, one thing is clear – Ybarra isn’t afraid to challenge the status quo in search of a better gaming experience for all.",

    "text": "The Ministry of Health informed that the whole country has recorded about 70 cases of whooping cough (pertussis) from the beginning of the year to now via the national infectious disease surveillance system, mostly cases in some Northern provinces and cities. Besides, many cases of measles, measles-suspected typhus and smallpox were also detected in many places. On these days, the Northern region has experienced cold windy and rainy weather along with high humidity creating favorable environment conditions for viruses and increasing the risk of epidemic infectious diseases, especially respiratory diseases. In addition, the vaccine supply's interruption in the Expanded Program on Immunization in recent times is a risk factor for disease spike. Amid the outbreak risk of the above-mentioned diseases, the Ministry of Health required localities to strengthen surveillance, testing and early detection for whooping cough infections, other infectious diseases and strictly handle newly arising outbreaks. Apart from close coordination with the Institutes of Hygiene and Epidemiology and Pasteur Institute to analyze the disease situation, assess risks of disease severity, make proposals and deploy appropriate and timely anti-epidemic measures, hospitals must proactively receive, treat and resuscitate patients, control infections and prevent cross-infection in medical examination and treatment facilities. It is necessary to promote regular vaccination for subjects under the Expanded Program on Immunization. Health Departments of provinces and cities nationwide need to promote communication about disease risks and measures of prevention and mitigation for whooping cough and other infectious diseases that vaccines can prevent; recommend people regularly washing hands with soap and water; promptly detect the suspected cases with symptom of illness and so on.",
