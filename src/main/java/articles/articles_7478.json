    "title": "Chaos, violence on major Cape Town roads as taxis go on strike - The Mail & Guardian",
    "text": "National / 28 December 2023 By Eunice Masson FacebookXEmailLinkedInWhatsApp A metro police vehicle was set alight Traffic peaked early on major roads connecting Cape Town to surrounding suburbs on Thursday afternoon as dozens of minibus taxis left the inner city after the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) announced a provincial shutdown that is set to last for seven days. Shortly after 3pm, slow-moving traffic was recorded on major routes due to taxis leaving the city. Soon after, incidents of public violence were reported which led to road closures on the N2, M5 and Jakes Gerwel Drive, the city’s traffic services spokesperson, Kevin Jacobs, confirmed. Footage shared widely on official traffic WhatsApp groups showed incidents of looting taking place between Duinefontein and Jakes Gerwel Drive, while a traffic service vehicle was set alight on the N2. In another incident, a bus was set alight at the Nyanga taxi rank. Renewed tension between the local government and the minibus taxi service started last week when Santaco withdrew its participation from the minibus taxi task team — an initiative aimed at addressing permit barriers and other grievances in the Western Cape. A meeting was convened between the taxi council, its executives and regional associations in response to the city’s enforcement operations earlier this week which resulted in 15 minibus taxis being impounded and saw several people arrested. A bus was torched at Nyanga taxi rank Santaco’s deputy chair Nceba Enge said all the taxis across the region were being “called” as he spoke to the Mail & Guardian. “We are hopeful that they [the local government] will feel the pain of the people that are out there without transport, now, as we speak,” said Enge, while sharing a video showing Mitchells Plain’s northern transport interchange empty as people gathered at the rank were left stranded. In a statement, Santaco said it had taken a decision to embark on a strike from 3pm on Thursday and resume services on 10 August. “This decision has not been taken lightly, but as an industry, we are left with no other option but to embark on this stayaway, due to the frivolous impoundment operations run by the government, which has had a negative impact on our operators and industry.” According to Santaco’s provincial spokesperson Mandla Hermanus, 6 000 taxis have been impounded since January. “During this stayaway there will be no march or any form of protests that will take place. All operations will stop and we have urged our operators to refrain from any acts of violence and threatening behaviour,” reads the statement.

(WZTV) — In Maury County, where several [people were injured and one person died](https://fox17.com/news/local/radar-confirmed-tornado-hits-maury-county-wednesday-middle-tennessee-columbia-spring-hill-national-weather-service-severe-weather#), Columbia residents describe what they saw as a tornado ripped through their neighborhood. On Thursday, FOX 17 News went into some of the hardest hit communities seeing just some of the devastation, that families now have to grapple with. Some of the damage was seen on Cardinal Trail. It's the roadway where Shannon McCue rushed to in an attempt to get home to her husband, Adam Lazenby. ALSO READ | ['Come together, have patience and rebuild': Maury County community unites amid devastation](https://fox17.com/newsletter-daily/come-together-have-patience-and-rebuild-maury-county-community-unites-amid-deadly-tornado-devastation-severe-weather-columbia-spring-hill-tennessee) But the storm hit sooner than she expected, with two fallen trees trapping her car in. This, while Lazenby says he road out the tornado on their property. I was sitting in the driveway waiting for her to get home and then the back shop door blew into the hood of my truck and I ran and just jumped in the back seat as the tornado just took the whole shop around me,\" detailed Lazenby. \"You did see it, you said it sounded like a freight train,\" said McCue. \"It's cliché, but it really is that loud like a train. It took most the building with it. His truck and the debris is still there. The truck saved him.\" Celebrating their 10-year anniversary this year, this couple now feels closer than ever. And although they're now looking at upwards of $100,000 in damage, they are just thankful their home is still standing. As of Thursday, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency says in Maury County 105 homes were damaged and 40 were destroyed. TEMA says they're working with the community to do a more formal damage assessment Friday morning at first light, and they'll be evaluating that damage to see what kind of potential aid these families may qualify for.

    "text": "Mom born on Leap Day welcomes baby on Leap Day \"I just hope that she knows that she's special.\" A North Carolina mother who was [born on Leap Day](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/video/leap-day-babies-celebrate-birthdays-caribbean-cruise-107669261) 40 years ago welcomed a baby girl Thursday, which also happens to be Leap Day. Dr. Kai Sun, an assistant professor of medicine and a rheumatologist at Duke Health, and her husband, Michael Paik, welcomed their third child, a daughter they named Chloe at 5:12 a.m. on Feb. 29. Baby Chloe made her big debut three days after her Feb. 26 due date and weighed in at 6 pounds and 13 ounces, Sun said. \"My husband and I were just saying how cool it would be if she were born on the same day as my birthday. And somehow, it happened,\" Sun told [\"Good Morning America\"](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/) Thursday morning from her hospital bed at Duke University Hospital, where she also works. Sun said she and her daughter are now both \"doing well.\" \"She was breathing fast initially when she was born so they took her to the nursery for a little bit to see the pediatrician but everything checked out and she's peacefully sleeping,\" Sun said. Chloe's [Leap Day arrival](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/video/sisters-share-leap-day-birthday-doctor-delivered-69297676) is a notable one, not just because of her birth date but also because she is a rainbow baby for Sun and Paik. \"We had a [miscarriage](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/miscarriage-stillbirth-nervous-65986881) almost exactly a year ago and so that makes her more special,\" Sun said. \"There were some little things along the way,\" the doctor added of her pregnancy. \"There was some abnormal finding on the initial ultrasound that we were nervous about. And then I had COVID. And I fell on my belly in [my] third trimester. There are just some small things that happened that made us a little nervous but everything turned out well at the end.\" Sun said she had a message for her newborn. \"I just hope that she knows that she's special, not just because she has a special birthday,\" the mom of three said. For her birthday this year, Sun said she plans on resting but she hopes to be discharged Friday along with Chloe. She said she is also looking forward to introducing Chloe to her older siblings, Charis, 5, and Caleb, 3, and celebrating more in the days to come. \"I look forward to taking her home with me and have her meet the rest of the family, my parents and her siblings,\" Sun said. \"And we'll have cake, of course.\"",

    "text": "One Direction star Louis Tomlinson's 19-year-old sister Phoebe has become a mother after welcoming a baby girl with her partner Jack Varley.\nIn a beautiful reel, Phoebe, an influencer with over a million followers, shared the heartwarming moment her little girl came into the world.\nToday's top videos\nThe clip which was shot in black and white skipped through her water birth with intimate scenes from her labour. At one point the camera pans out to a shot of a baby romper hanging in the room before quickly jumping to the moment when Phoebe tearfully cradled her baby for the first time.\nLouis Tomlinson's sister has become a mum after welcoming a baby girl. Pic: Phoebe Tomlinson Instagram As the little girl was handed to her, Barton Town footballer Jack, whom she began dating in 2022, leaned in for a sweet kiss.\nCue more adorable shots of the baby wrapped up in a little hat and boots squirming about in her incubator and their little home movie ends with Phoebe crying as holds her.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by PHOEBE ROSE TOMLINSON (@thephoebetomlinson)\nAs well as the intimate video, Phoebe also shared her daughter's beautiful name which pays tribute to her late mother. She and Jack have named the little girl Olive, which is associated with peace, while her middle name is Johannah after Phoebe and Louis' late mum.\nJohannah passed away at just 43 years of age in 2016 from leukemia and it looks like her memory will live on her granddaughter. The family also tragically lost their sister Félicité in 2019 who passed away from an accidental overdose.\nPhoebe Tomlinson and her boyfriend Jack.

Her dad Mark wrote: 'Way, way beyond proud, so begins the best journey in life ever.'\n'Congratulations Phoebe, she's scrumptious and I love the name and its significance to you too. Enjoy these precious moments,' posted someone else.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by PHOEBE ROSE TOMLINSON (@thephoebetomlinson)\nWhen the couple announced they were expecting in June they had thought they were having a baby boy but found out at their 20-week scan that they were actually having a girl.

    "text": "California beachgoers enthralled by huge waves from storms – but they bring flooding and rip currents too\nBy Cindy Von Quednow, David Williams and Robert Shackelford, CNN\n(CNN) — Offshore storms shoved waves toward communities along the California coast, bringing flooding, evacuations and fright to nearly 20 people who were briefly swept away on a Ventura beach on Thursday.\nThe swells will not be a one-day thing: Some areas of the California coast will see towering waves – some up to 25 or 30 feet – through the weekend. The waves will usher high water and rip currents. Coastal flood alerts and high-surf alerts stretch from the US-Mexico border to north of the Bay Area.\nWaves, coupled with high tides, sent torrents of seawater into Santa Cruz along the central coast.\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office issued an evacuation warning for some areas. The evacuation warning covered an unincorporated area of the county near Seacliff State Beach and Rio Del Mar, according to a\npost on the department’s Facebook page.\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Santa Cruz warned of coastal flooding at the Rio Del Mar Esplanade\nin a post on X and urged people to avoid the area.\n“Rio Del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded. Please avoid the area and do not attempt to drive across flooded areas. Road closures are in effect, so please do not drive around them. Drive with caution and prioritize safety,” it wrote.\nFive campers were evacuated along the San Luis Obispo coast Thursday, officials detailed in a social media post.\nThe spectacular waves drew surfers and onlookers, who gawked at nature’s power.\nJust northwest of Los Angeles, 15 to 20 onlookers were briefly swept away after a large wave overtook a beach barrier in a Ventura neighborhood hit by high surf, police Cmdr. Ryan Weeks told CNN.\nThe onlookers were washed down the street about 30 to 50 yards, Weeks said.\n“No one was injured, but they were taken for a little ride,” he said.\nStreets in the area were closed as a precaution, as was a main access point to the Ventura Pier to encourage people to stay away.\n“We’re trying to keep people off the beach to keep them from getting hit by rogue waves,” Weeks said.\nAerial video from CNN affiliate\nKABC showed the aftermath, as residents in the area tried to clean up the foamy, sandy mess.\nThe flooding comes as the Southern California coast was being impacted by large swells, the National Weather Service (NWS) in Los Angeles\nsaid in a social media post.\nOne swell reached about 20 feet at Ventura Pier, the agency added.\n“Dangerous surf, life-threatening rip currents, and coastal flooding are expected at the beaches this week. Impacts are expected to become most extreme on Thursday,” NWS in Los Angeles\nposted.\nThe most significant impacts are expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, according to the agency.\nFifteen to 20-foot waves are expected in the central coast, bringing potentially damaging coastal flooding.\n“Beach conditions becoming extremely dangerous Thursday morning continuing through the weekend,” the NWS in Los Angeles said in its\nforecast.\nOfficials recommend beachgoers stay out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions and potentially life-threatening rip currents. Beach erosion also is possible.\n“Prepare for significant sea water flooding, especially in low-lying areas (including beaches/harbors) & at high tide,” the NWS in Los Angeles said.\nIn Ocean Beach, near San Diego, the curious and surfers thronged to the beach to take it all in, according to\nCNN affiliate KGTV.\nNot everyone who brought a board got into the roiling surf.\n“My friend asked me if I wanted to come check it out, and once I saw it, I knew it was too large and in charge for me,” Gerry Giuliano told the affiliate. “I mean, it’s hitting the pier and that’s a warning sign that it’s pretty big, closing out and breaking pretty quickly, too.”\nNorthern California is expected to have its own share of problems.\nThe Bay Area is under a coastal flood warning until 6 p.m. Thursday, with significant coastal flooding expected through the evening hours before conditions begin to improve.\nA high-surf warning is in effect in the Bay Area until 3 a.m. Friday.\n“Dangerously large breaking waves of 28 to 33 ft with up to 40 ft possible at favored locations,” the NWS said.\nThe agency listed said San Francisco, Monterey Bay, Point Reyes and Big Sur are among the affected areas.\nAn\nevacuation order was issued for a portion of Marin County near San Francisco.\nA deadly storm\nslammed the California coast in January 2023.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
