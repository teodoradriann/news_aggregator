    "title": "Cambodia 'upcycler' turns tonnes of plastic bottles into brooms | Nasdaq",
    "text": "By Chantha Lach PHNOM PENH, Feb 16 (Reuters) - In a small warehouse in Cambodia's capital, a group of workers sit and spin waste plastic bottles into strips, turning them into bristles for brooms, of which they churn out 500 each day. For the past 11 months they have transformed around 40 tonnes of discarded plastic bottles, about 5,000 bottles per day, by \"upcycling\" them into brooms they say are more robust than regular brushes. Those sell for 10,000 riel ($2.50) and 15,000 riel ($3.75) each. Plastic strips from the empty bottles are collected into a bundle on a machine, before being softened in hot water and sliced evenly to be sewn with metal wires into the ends of a bamboo stick. Cambodian entrepreneur Has Kea, 41, wants to reduce plastic pollution in his community, in a city that produces up to 38,000 tonnes of all types of waste each day, according to its environmental department. About a fifth of that is single-use plastic that ends up in landfills and waterways. \"This broom is quite solid, not easy to break,\" said Suon Kosal, a 26-year-old Buddhist monk whose temple bought 80 of the brooms last month. Kea buys empty plastic bottles from trash collectors and garbage depots. With the seemingly endless supply, he is confident about the longevity of his business. He is also open to competitors stepping in to the market. \"This also help reduce pollution to the environment and encourages people to collect plastic bottles to sell to us at a higher price, which in turn, could earn them a better living,\" he said.

    "title": "Rain helps firefighters slow New Mexico blazes as Biden approves disaster relief",
    "text": "More than 1,000 firefighters in the US state of New Mexico took advantage of a break in the weather to gain the upper hand – for now – on a pair of wildfires that have killed two people, destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee.\nPresident Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of southern New Mexico, freeing up funding and more resources as crews worked to keep the flames from spreading.\nTheir efforts have received a boost from a storm system that brought with it rain, hail and cooler temperatures to the mountain village of Ruidoso and other parts of the state.\n“The fire has lost momentum,” Arthur Gonzales, the fire behaviour analyst for the federal attack team, told residents at a community meeting in Alamogordo on Thursday night.\n“We still have a lot of work to do, but it’s really changed that fire behaviour,” he added, noting that very little growth in the blaze is expected over the next few days.\nBut firefighters know this is a brief respite given the tinderbox conditions that helped fuel the fires in the first place.\nWithin days, the fires have consumed an area half the size of Washington, DC.\n“What we’re really focusing on now at this point is: when might we see this return to active fire spread?” Mr Gonzales said. “Is there potential for this to start picking up and moving again?”\nFederal and local officials said evacuation orders likely would remain in place for days in some places as crews snuff out hot spots around Ruidoso. Law enforcement officers are also patrolling the streets to keep potential looters away.\nDespite some reports that the fires were caused by human activity, federal incident commander Dave Gessar said the causes are under investigation and remain “undetermined”.\nThe federal disaster declaration will help with recovery efforts, including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe.\nResidents fled the larger of the two fires with little notice as it swept into neighbourhoods on Monday.\nMore areas were evacuated on Tuesday as the fire ballooned, consuming homes nestled among the the ponderosa pines that dominate the hillsides.\nAn estimated 1,400 structures have been destroyed or damaged, and Ruidoso mayor Lynn Crawford has estimated about half of these were homes. Whole portions of some communities were lost, he said.\n“These are things that are burnt to the foundations and all the trees around it,” he said. “It’s devastating.”\nAuthorities say a 60-year-old man who died was found near the popular Swiss Chalet Inn in Ruidoso. His\nfamily said he had arranged for a lift from friends but they were unable to get to him on Monday since the roads were blocked. It appeared he was overcome after he tried to set out on foot.\nOn Wednesday, officers discovered the skeletal remains of an unidentified second person in the driver’s seat of a burned vehicle.\nThe ongoing heatwave will likely spread to the Mid/Deep South and Southeast early next week🥵. Heat index values may exceed 110 degrees in some places.— National Weather Service (@NWS)\n[https://t.co/DGeRdJ7516] [June 20, 2024]\nA couple of residents have been driving around Ruidoso and neighbouring Alto, providing reports via social media of what they are seeing. There are locations where the ground was turned to ash, the trees were blackened and homes were reduced to their foundations, with only fireplaces remaining.\nMuch of the US south-west has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong winds, whipped the flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional medical centre and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.\nNationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,344 square miles this year – a figure higher than the 10-year average, according to the National Interagency Fire Centre.\nNearly 20 wildfires burning in California, Arizona, Colorado and Washington state and elsewhere are considered large and uncontained.",

    "title": "Broadcast police communications may pose priv | EurekAlert!",
    "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Police radio transmissions contain personally identifiable information that could pose privacy risks for members of the public, especially Black males, according to a new study by researchers at Penn State and the University of Chicago. “This study provides a window into police activity as events unfold,” said Shomir Wilson , associate professor of information sciences and technology at Penn State and study co-author. “We found that because police radio transmissions disproportionately involve Black suspects, there’s a proportionally higher privacy risk for Black people in these communications.” The researchers studied a total of 24 hours of human-transcribed and annotated broadcast police communications transmitted on a single day in three Chicago dispatch zones, or regions used to coordinate police activity. According to U.S. census data, one zone was majority non-Hispanic white, one majority Hispanic and one majority non-Hispanic Black. The team found that broadcast police communications mentioned males nine times more frequently than females and that Black males were most often mentioned of all groups, even in the majority white zone. The researchers presented their findings at the 27th Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing on Nov. 9-13 in Costa Rica. The team received a diversity, equity and inclusion recognition from the conference’s awards committee. “The typical police radio transmission is short and serves a coordinating purpose, something like ‘Car 54, where are you?’” said Chris Graziul , research assistant professor at the University of Chicago, study co-author and one of two principal investigators leading the project. “These transmissions try to communicate what’s happening and describe who’s involved. In the process, sensitive information is often disclosed.” The researchers obtained 9,115 transmissions — what they called “utterances” — that occurred when police or dispatch communicated via radio broadcast. They manually transcribed the transmissions and then randomly chose 2,000 utterances from across the three zones to analyze further. They developed a qualitative annotation scheme to label the text. They divided the annotated data into six categories, ranging from event information, such as “residential alarm break in\" or “traffic stop,” and procedural transmissions, such as the “car 54” example, to casual transmissions like “Morning, squad.” The researchers found that event utterances contained the most references — about 60% — to gender, race/ethnicity, age and protected health information, which can be used to identify individuals. Nearly 68% of utterances that included a sociodemographic indicator used male gendered terms, and approximately 69% of those utterances referred to Black people, according to the researchers. “Our findings contribute to a larger body of evidence about racial disparities in policing. What is novel here is the data source: radio transmissions,” Graziul said. “Despite prolific use by police systems around the world, few have explored what this means of communication can tell us about how policing operates in practice. Disproportionate mentions of Black people reflect a novel way to observe how officers’ attention is unevenly distributed across racial/ethnic groups, and identifying this disparity helps us understand challenges to the ethical use of this data source for research, like preventing leakage of sensitive personal information, which would impact Black communities substantially more than other communities.” After examining the utterances, the team tested a large language model (LLM), a widely used artificial intelligence tool, to determine its capacity to find personal information in the transcripts. Despite the unique nature of the language involved with broadcast police communications, the LLM detected personally identifiable information with high accuracy, highlighting the risk of privacy vulnerability. Bad actors, such as identity thieves, could use AI technology to quickly find and misuse the personal information in transcripts of police radio activity, according to the researchers. “This work reveals a concerning trend of racial inequality in terms of the exposure of sensitive information during police radio transmissions,” said Pranav Narayanan Venkit , graduate student pursuing a doctoral degree in informatics in the College of Information Sciences and Technology and first author on the paper. “This study may help researchers and developers give more thought to interactions between LLM and different segments of society — the policing community, minority populations and various other populations — to identify biases and protect personal information.” Miranda Goodman, who graduated with her bachelor’s degree from Penn State this past summer, and fourth-year Penn State student Samantha Kenny also contributed to this work. The National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health supported this work. This research was also supported by the Urban Resiliency Initiative, which is led by Margaret Beale Spencer, distinguished professor emerita at the University of Chicago and a principal investigator of this larger project.

    "text": "La precandidata a la gobernación del PNP sostuvo, tras votar en Carolina, que es la mejor opción para Puerto Rico, frente al incumbente Pedro Pierluisi 2 de junio de 2024 - 3:09 PM La precandidata a la gobernación del PNP sostuvo, tras votar en Carolina, que es la mejor opción para Puerto Rico, frente al incumbente Pedro Pierluisi 2 de junio de 2024 - 3:09 PM Nota del editor: no te pierdas ni un detalle de cara a las elecciones del 2024 en Puerto Rico. [Visita nuestro sitio especial](https://www.elnuevodia.com/especiales/elecciones-2024/) para mantenerte informado y [regístrate aquí en el boletín Pulso Político](https://www.elnuevodia.com/newsletters/pulso-politico/). --- Carolina - Tras hacer una marca bajo su nombre y el de [Elmer Román](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/elmer-roman/), a quien apoya como compañero de papeleta, la precandidata a la gobernación por el [Partido Nuevo Progresista](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/pnp/) (PNP), [Jenniffer González](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/jenniffer-gonzalez/), se expresó confiada este domingo en que “el pueblo” le dará la victoria en la contienda frente al incumbente [Pedro Pierluisi](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/pedro-pierluisi/). “El pueblo me lo pidió, mi base de partido me lo pidió. Estuve en la calle, estuve en la isla visitando por más de un año, y ese fue el sentir del pueblo. Todavía, al día de hoy, veo ese respaldo en la calle, así que, aquí estamos y, ahora, le compete la voluntad al pueblo de Puerto Rico. Yo acepté el reto que el pueblo me dio; ahora, es solamente acatar la voluntad del pueblo y de Dios”, aseveró. Fue casi al filo de la 1:00 p.m. que González llegó a votar a la escuela Salvador Brau, en Carolina, junto a su esposo, José Yovín Vargas, y su madre, Nydia Colón. Tras conversar con los medios de comunicación, se dirigió al colegio de votación y, unos 15 minutos después, hizo públicas sus papeletas. “Estoy feliz. Mi partido, a mí, me ha dado muchas oportunidades. Yo fui presidenta de la juventud (estadista) a los 14 años de edad y jamás esperé que un día yo fuera a estar en la papeleta a la gobernación, y hoy el tiempo, el pueblo y Dios me han llevado hasta aquí. Así que, que sea la voluntad de Dios y que el pueblo vote y seleccione lo mejor para Puerto Rico”, dijo González tras la votación. La madre de González dijo estar un poco “ansiosa”. “Esto está en manos de papa Dios, porque Él es quien decide todo, pero yo confío en que ella va ser electa y que va a cumplir con todo, porque ella conoce las necesidades de nuestro pueblo, y para eso se ha preparado”, dijo Colón. Fue el 28 de septiembre de 2023 cuando González hizo público su interés en aspirar por la candidatura a la gobernación por el PNP, retando así al gobernador Pierluisi. En aquel entonces, dijo, en un mensaje grabado, que Puerto Rico iba “por mal camino”, una expresión que provocó reacciones adversas entre miembros de la colectividad. Hoy, casi nueve meses después, González sostiene que ella es la mejor opción para el país. “Cuando anuncié mi candidatura, hablé de un cambio para Puerto Rico, hablé de un gobierno que le resuelva a la gente, de un gobierno ágil, de un gobierno con sentido de urgencia y sensibilidad, y hoy es el día que el pueblo de Puerto Rico tiene para escoger, a mi juicio, la gran diferencia”, puntualizó. “Si quiere quedarse como está, con los apagones, con los aumentos en el agua, con los aumentos en la luz, o si quiere un gobierno que le resuelva, y eso es lo que se vota hoy. Si quieren quedarse como están, pues, está la opción del gobernador y si quieren una opción de cambio, está el capitán Elmer Román y esta servidora”, subrayó. A pesar de los contratiempos surgidos durante la primera parte de la jornada, como las fallas en el servicio eléctrico y la supuesta falta de funcionarios de su campaña en algunos colegios de votación, González se expresó confiada en que la intención de cada elector se hará valer. “Yo no tengo preocupación con eso. Antes, se votaba sin una máquina y se sabían los resultados”, expuso. “Yo tengo ahí, no solamente una batería de abogados, sino voluntarios que están en las mesas y funcionarios de mi partido, que han estado históricamente ahí defendiendo los votos de Pierluisi y de otra gente en las múltiples elecciones. Así que es el mismo grupo de trabajo que, en este momento, estamos enfrentados en unas primarias, pero luego de hoy, en noviembre, vamos todos juntos a una [elección general](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/elecciones-2024/)”, señaló. González rechazó las denuncias sobre la falta de funcionarios de colegio, y dijo que esas expresiones supuestamente forman parte de una estrategia de la oposición. “En el caso mío, son todos voluntarios, no hay nadie obligado”, expuso. Referente a los votos por adelantado y la incertidumbre que existe con la contabilización de los sufragios que aún no han sido recibidos en la [Comisión Estatal de Elecciones](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/comision-estatal-elecciones/), González sostuvo que espera que el proceso culmine sin sombras. No obstante, dijo que cualquier alegación de fraude será analizada por su equipo electoral. “Yo voy a hacer valer la ley y el reglamento para que se cuente cada voto y la intención del elector”, afirmó. Un total de 122,001 electores solicitaron votar adelantado por correo: 84,240 del PNP y 37,761 del [Partido Popular Democrático](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/ppd/). A las denuncias hechas más temprano por el director de campaña del gobernador, [Edwin Mundo](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/edwin-mundo/), quien alegó que representantes de González en los colegios vestían camisetas alusivas a la campaña, en violación a lo establecido por la CEE, la precandidata reconoció que habían comprado unas “t-shirts” con el logo de la Palma. La situación, sin embargo, se resolvió. En la tarde, González participaría de una misa junto a su familia antes de acudir a su comité de campaña, en Hato Rey, a esperar los resultados finales.

    "text": "Manovra, Confagricoltura: misure positive, il Milleproroghe dà respiro alle imprese 3 Minuti di Lettura Venerdì 29 Dicembre 2023, 19:41 Confagricoltura apprezza le misure per il settore contenute nella manovra.\n«Confagricoltura plaude a diverse misure a supporto del settore primario, inserite nella Legge di Bilancio; in particolare: il Fondo per la gestione delle emergenze in agricoltura che prevede lo stanziamento di 100 milioni di euro per ciascuno degli anni 2024, 2025 e 2026; il differimento, dal 1° gennaio 2024 al 1° luglio 2024, della decorrenza dell’imposta sui manufatti in plastica monouso e dell’imposta sul consumo delle bevande analcoliche edulcorate», si legge in una nota.\n«La manovra - prosegue l'associazione degli agricoltori guidata da Massimiliano Giansanti - risponde alle richieste della Confederazione in merito alla reintroduzione delle misure di intervento per la previsione della liquidità aziendale, al fine di evitare il sovraindebitamento. Significativo il sostegno alle imprese, tramite il finanziamento del credito di imposta per il Mezzogiorno (pari a 1,8 miliardi di euro); le dotazioni di bilancio per i contratti di sviluppo e le misure agevolative della cosiddetta “Nuova Sabatini”. Accolta anche la richiesta di intervento, da parte di Confagricoltura, per nuovi stanziamenti finalizzati alla ricostruzione dei territori interessati dai sismi degli anni scorsi e dagli eventi alluvionali manifestatesi dal 1° maggio 2023».\nL'associazione di Palazzo della Valle auspica poi «un progressivo aumento degli interventi sistemici a vantaggio del sistema imprese, guardando con favore all’incentivazione di ogni azione che possa favorire la ripresa dei consumi. Bene, dunque, l’introduzione del “Bonus spesa”, cosiddetto “Social Card”, che può stimolare l’acquisto di prodotti dell’agricoltura italiana». Si sottolinea, infine, «la necessità di uno sforzo ulteriore su alcuni temi: la reintroduzione dell’Irpef (che possa almeno avvenire in modo graduale), la gestione del rischio in agricoltura e la tassazione retroattiva in relazione ai contratti di superficie».\nConfagricoltura giudica positivamente anche le norme del decreto-legge Milleproroghe. E’ il caso - rileva ancora l'organizzazione - della proroga al 31 dicembre 2024 della possibilità di rinviare i controlli sulla regolarità contributiva (Durc), da parte delle amministrazioni competenti, al momento del saldo in caso di erogazione di aiuti e contributi pubblici. Analoga possibilità viene prevista in materia di inadempienza rispetto all’obbligo di versamento derivante dalla notifica di una o più cartelle di pagamento da parte dell’Agenzia delle Entrate. In tal caso il pagamento in anticipo è sottoposto a clausola risolutiva e quindi al recupero dei benefici erogati.\n«Positiva - rileva Confagricoltura - anche la proroga al 2024 per l’applicazione delle misure di contenimento della Xylella fastidiosa nel comparto olivicolo. Il decreto Milleproroghe - aggiunge la Confederazione - ha anche esteso al 31 dicembre 2024 (era al 31.12.23) il termine per la revisione delle macchine agricole immatricolate dal 1° gennaio 1984 al 31 dicembre 1996, e al 31 dicembre 2025 (era al 31.12.24) la scadenza per la revisione di quelle immatricolate dal 1° gennaio 1997 al 31 dicembre 2019. La proroga - evidenzia Confagricoltura - si è resa ancora una volta necessaria perché non è stato ancora emanato il dm che dovrà stabilire la tipologia di verifiche da effettuare in sede di revisione e, soprattutto, l’impostazione organizzativa dei centri di revisione. Per cui ad oggi, non è possibile procedere alla revisione delle macchine agricole>.\n«Confagricoltura apprezza inoltre le misure volte a estendere i termini degli strumenti già individuati per mitigare gli effetti della siccità sulle coltivazioni - si legge ancora in una nota dell'associazione -. Le proroghe inserite nel decreto-legge approvato dal Consiglio dei ministri danno respiro alle imprese - conclude Confagricoltura -. Si ribadisce, tuttavia, la necessità di interventi strutturali più ampi a favore dell’agricoltura italiana e delle sue aziende, per dare slancio al settore e all’economia del Paese».",
