    "text": "TORONTO — Commuters across the Greater Toronto Area and parts of eastern Ontario had to contend with blowing snow and slippery sidewalks while heading home Friday evening as a blast of wintery weather hit parts of the province.\nEnvironment Canada has placed a region stretching from Hamilton all the way east past Kingston, Ont., under snowfall warnings, saying it was predicting up to 15 centimetres of snow.\nThe weather agency says the snow is expected to continue into the evening and then is set to taper off from west to east late in the night.\nIt warns the snowfall could have \"significant impact\" on the evening commute, making for low visibility and potentially slick roadways.\nEnvironment Canada has said peak snowfall rates of two centimetres per hour are possible.\nIt says surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\nThe agency says people should be ready to adjust their driving with changing road conditions.\nIt says drivers should turn on their lights and maintain a safe following distance if visibility is reduced while driving.\nOther parts of Ontario, including Windsor and London, are under a weather advisory, with between five and 10 centimetres of snow in the forecast.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March. 22, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "MISSOURI CITY, Texas (KTRK) -- A Missouri City teen is among just 100 students across the country invited to be part of the 2024 Disney Dreamers Academy. The mentorship program at Walt Disney World is aimed at inspiring exceptional young people to follow their biggest dreams. Sixteen-year-old Nigel Mushambi was accepted into the program out of thousands. He's an entrepreneur and award-winning author, who created the coloring and activity book \"Dear Legacy\" with his brother. The book is all about unleashing the vision, confidence and power of African American girls, boys and teens. Nigel has also volunteered over 500 hours in his community and has received the President's Volunteer Service Award three times. \"For me, it's important to volunteer because I just love giving back to my community,\" said Nigel. \"If you say volunteer work, I'll be there.\" \"I think it's more of a legacy in our family,\" said Nigel's mom, Trinda Mushambi. \"My mom volunteered, I volunteer, and that's definitely something I want to pass down, and hopefully he'll continue that legacy with his family.\" Nigel says he was inspired to apply to the Disney Dreamers Academy by his brother, who was accepted into the program last year. He was overjoyed when he found out he had been accepted, too. \"I was just shocked, honestly,\" said Nigel. \"I opened the letter and I was like, I just felt like a warm feeling. I was so happy that I got this opportunity. I just want to connect with the other people, because only 100 people are selected to I'm sure they're very, very special people.\" Nigel and the rest of the Disney Dreamers Class of 2024 were able to spend four days at Walt Disney World this month, participating in workshops and seminars with business leaders, Disney executives, celebrities, authors and educators.

    "text": "County finds 4 rabid animals so far in 2024 CDC has warning about wildlife cases Possible exposures from discovery place SOUTH RIVER — There’s now a total of four rabid animals found in Middlesex County this year, according to MyCentralJersey.com. This time a home was found to have a live bat that later tested positive, the county’s Office of Health Services said to the outlet in a statement . They reported the discovery of the bat happened in the area of Daily and Edgewood Streets on Monday. The concern with this latest finding: three feasible exposures because of a dog and two people in the home. The outlet said the people were suggested to see their doctor and the dog’s veterinarian. Animal Control was called Monday and sent the bat to the New Jersey Department of Health Laboratory, according to MyCentralJersey.com. The positive result was shared Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies rabies as a fatal viral disease if not properly treated. They say to pay particular attention to wildlife as roughly 3 in 4 Americans live where some species are positive for the disease.

    "text": "Entertainment Sports \"I am described as Angel's understandable ear,\" Shaquille O'Neal tells PEOPLE exclusively of the LSU star who was selected by the Chicago Sky in the WNBA Draft By Skyler Caruso Skyler Caruso Skyler Caruso is a Writer and Reporter of PEOPLE Digital Entertainment. She joined PEOPLE in 2021, but has eight years of experience working in digital publishing with a focus on entertainment and pop culture news. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 18, 2024 05:00PM EDT Close Angel Reese and Shaquille O'Neal. Photo: Getty Shaquille O'Neal is Angel Reese's teammate off the court. The retired NBA star opened up to PEOPLE about his close bond with the former LSU player — and revealed the first thing he told her after she was selected by the Chicago Sky as the seventh pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft on Monday night. \"I am described as Angel's understandable ear,\" O'Neal tells PEOPLE exclusively of Reese. \"I know things that she went through, I know what she's going through, I know what's about to happen to her and I could give her advice.\" The basketball legend, who was the number one pick in the 1992 NBA Draft before going on to play for six NBA teams over his 19-year career, says the rookie can find comfort in his advice due to his experience in the league. O'Neal says when they \"speak about greatness,\" he's \"seen it\" and \"heard it.\" Therefore, he says, \"you can take my word for it.\" In the last year, he has become a mentor to Reese, who rose to fame during LSU's championship run in the 2023 March Madness tournament. Angel Reese Selected by Chicago Sky with 7th Pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft Angel Reese poses with WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert at 2024 Draft. Sarah Stier/Getty And that special bond is not only because O'Neal is a former LSU Tiger himself, before he was drafted by the Orlando Magic in 1992, he says. \"She's the same age as my children, so I only want the best for her,\" the retired NBA star and father of six tells PEOPLE. \"And when you have daughters, you know how to use that calm voice,\" he adds. So after Reese was selected in the WNBA Draft, O'Neal says, \"the first thing I told her is I was proud of her.\" As a self-described \"leader,\" O'Neal says he tries to never \"micromanage people.\" He says he's careful with his word choices and avoids demands — rather, he says, \"I'm happy for you. I'm proud of you. If you need anything, you call me.\" Shaquille O’Neal Escorts Angel Reese and Her Mom for LSU’s Senior Day: ‘Bayou Barbie Is My Favorite Senior’ Shaquille O'Neal, Angel Reese. Ethan Miller/Getty; Justin Tafoya/NCAA Photos via Getty O'Neal also pointed out that Reese's \"game is similar\" to his \"based on the fact that we do it our way\" and \"we're unapologetic about it.\" He continues, \"She plays with a certain passion — and a lot of times, you can't really understand that until you understand where a person comes from.\" Reese is from Baltimore, Maryland — \"one of the toughest places in the world,\" notes O'Neal. \"She had to be tough. She is tough and she applies that on the court. Some people don't like that and it's understandable, but she's not apologetic about it.\" O'Neal emphasizes: \"I don't want her to apologize. I want her to stay beautiful, stay classy and continue making a name for herself and taking care of her family.\" Angel Reese Says NCAA Championship Forced Her to 'Mature Quickly': 'It's a Fast Life I'm Living' (Exclusive) Angel Reese of LSU in March 2023. Maddie Meyer/Getty On March 4, O'Neal and Reese shared a special moment together when the NBA icon escorted the NCAA player and her mother (also named Angel) from the locker room onto the court at his alma mater LSU, for Reese's senior day celebration. After the game, Reese told ESPN it's \"been great\" to have O'Neal's support. \"He's really smart, not just on the basketball court, but just in life.\" She continued, \"He has his doctorate, so he's educated, being a lot of things outside of basketball. Being able to have somebody like that has been a great inspiration for me. And of course, enjoying the moment like this with him and the rest of my family was fun tonight,\" per ESPN.",
