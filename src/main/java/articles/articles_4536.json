    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost and found: Forgotten WWII-era Bible finds its way home to fallen airman's family [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan's uncle called the number written in the note, he spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. The families organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the McKnights, who are from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Montreal study finds increased screening, early detection grows pancreatic cancer survival odds | CityNews Montreal",
    "text": "A recent study done by the Pancreatic Cancer Early Detection Consortium (PRECEDE) says the survival rate of those with pancreatic cancer can increase through early detection. PRECEDE says pancreatic cancer has risen “dramatically” over the past few years, and says the survival rate is around 12 per cent. In cases when the cancer is detected early enough and treatment can begin, the survival rate climbs to over 80 per cent. The study will be co-led by Dr. George Zogopoulos from Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC) and the Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Institute at McGill University, and found an approach to improve surveillance of people at high risk of pancreatic cancer, based on different categories of specific risk factors — family history, the existence of a potentially cancer-causing genetic mutation (a pathogenic germline variant or PGV), or both. It was also determined that high-risk individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer were at higher risk of having pancreatic cysts. “The presence of cysts may identify individuals that are at increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer over time, because of cyst changes or because the presence of cysts signals that the pancreas has an intrinsic aberration making it more susceptible to cyst progression or other precancerous growths,” says senior author Dr. Diane M. Simeone, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center (New York University Langone Health at the time of the study). “Longer follow-up time is needed to determine if familial pancreatic cancer signifies a higher risk for developing pancreatic cancer compared to pathogenic germline variant status in a pancreatic-cancer-predisposition gene.” The study found that high-risk individuals should adhere to higher screening recommendations. “Our work demonstrates the potential of a large international integrated clinical and research program developed to detect and intercept precancerous and cancerous changes in the pancreas. This surveillance program may lead to improved outcomes in a disease that currently has low survival rates,” explains Dr. Zogopoulos, co-lead author of the study and scientist in the Cancer Research program at the RI-MUHC. “Individuals who are concerned they are at risk for pancreatic cancer can participate in PRECEDE and obtain an assessment from one the PRECEDE sites in North America and Europe. If the individual is assessed to be at increased risk for pancreatic cancer, they will have the opportunity to undergo clinical surveillance for pancreatic cancer, according to the clinical surveillance services available in their area.” Over 3,000 individuals were enrolled in the study which was conducted between Apr. 1, 2020 and Nov. 21, 2022.",
