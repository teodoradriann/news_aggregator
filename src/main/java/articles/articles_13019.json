    "title": "La dirección del organismo cultural de la Diputación de Alicante: ocho cargos vinculados al PP",
    "text": "El Instituto Alicantino de Cultura Juan Gil-Albert (IAC) cuenta en su nueva etapa, capitaneada por la periodista Cristina Martínez , con ocho directores y subdirectores vinculados al PP, según se desprende del portal de transparencia. La institución cultural, dependiente de la Diputación de Alicante presidida por el popular Toni Pérez, sigue la estela de su predecesor, Carlos Mazón. En la anterior etapa, con María Teresa Pérez Vázquez de directora, el IAC tuvo a cinco cargos de PP y Ciudadanos entre sus directivos . En el departamento de Humanidades del Gil-Albert figuran José Rafael Pascual, alcalde de San Vicent del Raspeig y subdirector de la sección de Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial, y Raquel Violero, subdirectora de Cultura Inclusiva e Intergeneracional y candidata en la lista popular de Xàbia en las últimas elecciones municipales. En Publicaciones e Investigación, la subdirección de la sección de fondos documentales recae en Lino Antonio Pascual, alcalde de Relleu que repite en el cargo del Gil-Albert, mientras que David Beltrá, portavoz del PP en Novelda, figura como subdirector de la sección de Investigación. Por otro lado, en el departamento de Arte y Comunicación Visual, Ana Pellicer, concejal del PP en Benidorm ejerce de subdirectora de la sección de Patrimonio Artístico y Arquitectura y Erica Sánchez, exedil popular de Elche, ostenta la subdirección de Cultura Audiovisual y Redes Sociales. Finalmente, la dirección del departamento de Ciencias Jurídicas y Sociales recae en Lourdes Aznar, alcaldesa popular de Crevillent mientras que Juan Fernando Giner, alcalde de Murla, figura como subdirector de la sección social. En la relación de directivos también figura Rafael Sanjuan Fernández, del PSPV de Agres, como subdirector de la sección de Artes Plásticas. Por otro lado, Irene Ballester, vocal del Consell Valencià de Cultura a propuesta de Compromís, repite como subdirectora de la sección de cultura popular, tradiciones y territorio. Además de los cargos vinculados a la política municipal, el organigrama también cuenta con directivos vinculados al mundo docente y cultural. En la nueva etapa de la institución cultural desaparecen los directivos vinculados a Ciudadanos, la formación que gobernaba con el PP en la Diputación de Alicante durante el anterior mandato de Carlos Mazón. La presencia de directivos del Instituto Alicantino de Cultura Juan Gil-Albert vinculados a los partidos que gobiernan la institución provincial ha sido una constante. En cuatro años, la institución provincial abonó 1,4 millones de euros a su equipo directivo por asistencias a reuniones, tal como informó este diario .",

    "title": "Moscow court hands long jail terms to two men for reciting poetry | Russia",
    "text": "A Moscow court on Thursday sentenced two men to years in prison for taking part in the recital of verses against the Ukraine campaign during an anti-mobilisation protest last year.\nArtyom Kamardin, 33, received a seven-year sentence for reciting a poem, and Yegor Shtovba, 23, was sentenced to five and a half years for attending the protest. The two were seen behind a glass partition in a heavily guarded courtroom.\nJust before his sentencing, a smiling Kamardin recited a poem that refers to poetry as “gut-wrenching” and often disliked by “people accustomed to order”.\nAfter the sentence was read out, there were cries of “Shame!” from supporters in the courtroom, some of whom were later detained by police outside the court building, an AFP reporter saw.\nArtyom Kamardin and Yegor Shtovba were kept in a glass cage in the courtroom. Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Russian authorities have detained thousands for simple acts of protest against the offensive in Ukraine, with criticism in effect outlawed.\nKamardin has claimed that during his detention he was raped by police officers and forced to film an apology video as officers threatened his partner.\nOn the eve of his arrest in September 2022, he had recited his poem “Kill me, militia man!” on a Moscow square where dissidents have been gathering since the Soviet era.\nKamardin also shouted offensive slogans against the imperial “New Russia” project aiming to annex the south of Ukraine.\nRussian rapper jailed amid backlash over ‘almost naked’ party at Moscow nightclub\nRead more Both were convicted of “inciting hatred” and “calling for activities threatening state security”.\nKamardin told the court he did not know his actions broke the law and asked for mercy. “I am not a hero, and going to prison for my beliefs was never in my plans,” he said in a statement, posted on his supporters’ Telegram channel.\nAfter the sentencing, his father, Yury, said: “This is a total outrage!”\nAbout two dozen friends came to support the defendants along with the poets’ parents and wives.\nKamardin’s wife, Alexandra Popova, was in the crowd. “It is a very harsh sentence. Seven years for poems, for a non-violent crime,” she told AFP, before being taken away by police officers.\nIn an interview with AFP in late 2022, she had recounted her then boyfriend’s arrest, saying officers threatened her with “gang-rape”, hit her and sprayed superglue on her cheeks and mouth.\nAlexandra Popova. Her husband, Artyom, says he was tortured after being taken into custody in Moscow. Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Meanwhile, Kamardin was taken to a separate room, where – as he told his lawyer – he was beaten and raped with a barbell. Kamardin was also forced to film an apology video.\nShtovba also insisted he did not break the law. In his last statement in court, published by independent site Mediazona, he asked the judge: “What have I done that’s illegal? Read poetry?”\nHe also addressed his mother, whom he said depended on him financially. “Mom, I know that you, more than anyone, believe in my innocence … Still, I’m sorry for how things turned out, leaving you and Dad alone.”\nNikolai Dayneko, who was arrested at the same time, was sentenced to four years in prison last May after entering a pre-trial agreement, according to OVD-info.\nThese are the latest in a string of heavy sentences against Russians who protested against the offensive, in trials critics denounce as absurd.\nGermany’s foreign ministry condemned Thursday’s verdict, accusing the Kremlin of “letting the judiciary stifle freedom of expression”.\nIn mid-November judge Oksana Demiasheva sentenced artist Aleksandra Skochilenko to seven years in prison for swapping price tags with slogans criticising Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. Skochilenko had replaced five price tags in a branch of one of Russia’s largest supermarket chains in St Petersburg with messages about the conflict.\nThe trials of ordinary Russians usually take place away from public attention, unlike those of prominent critics.\nMost of Russia ’s high-profile opposition figures have fled the country or are behind bars, including Alexei Navalny.\n Russia Ukraine Europe news\nReuse this content",

    "text": "Tra messaggi di solidarietà e di elogio, una storia a lieto fine e, in qualche modo, anche virale. Perché è una di quelle che vale la pena di raccontare Dopo avere dimesso una ragazza di 15 anni , arrivata al pronto soccorso dell' ospedale Murri di Fermo , nelle Marche, il medico di turno è andato a casa sua la mattina dopo, una volta smontato dal servizio, intorno alle 7, per sincerarsi delle sue condizioni di salute . E, in particolare, per verificare un dubbio sulla necessità di un ricovero in neurologia .\nCos’è successo Il ricovero è stato poi disposto e –secondo quanto si legge sulle pagine locali del Resto del Carlino - ha evitato all'adolescente conseguenze importanti . La ragazzina, infatti, era stata colpita da una infiammazione midollare ed era necessario che venisse presa in carico dal reparto al più presto. La famiglia era uscita dal pronto soccorso alle 3 del mattino, con l'idea di partire il giorno dopo per andare all'ospedale di Ancona.\nLe parole dei genitori “ Quando è suonato il campanello e abbiamo trovato il medico che ci aveva accolto al pronto soccorso, non ci potevamo credere . Non siamo più abituati a medici così ” raccontano i genitori.\nChi è il medico Si chiama Francesco Bernetti Evangelista ed è un medico in pensione, impegnato con una cooperativa che collabora con il pronto soccorso. “ Ho fatto solo il mio dovere, c'era da approfondire una situazione che in pronto soccorso non c'era stato modo di verificare fino in fondo ”, ha dichiarato Bernetti Evangelista, quasi schermendosi. E poi ha aggiunto: “ Sono medico da 40 anni , ho o perato circa 30mila persone . Non mi sembra di avere fatto qualcosa di strano”.\nIl lieto fine Dopo dieci giorni di ricovero e di terapie, la quindicenne è guarita ed è tornata in piedi. Il medico, invece, è tornato al suo lavoro.\nPer restare aggiornato sulle ultime notizie segui gratis il canale whatsapp del Tgla7\nPuoi anche iscriverti al canale whatsapp della rete la7\nContinua a leggere su Tg.La7.it Ti potrebbe interessare Migranti, scatta fermo amministrativo per la Sea Watch 5 La nave umanitaria si trova a Pozzallo dove ha sbarcato 56 persone e il cadavere di un 17enne 09.03.2024",
