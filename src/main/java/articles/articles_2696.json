    "title": "Seca. Falta de água no Algarve é \"pior de sempre\" mesmo após as chuvas",
    "text": "\"É verdade que as chuvas de janeiro e fevereiro trouxeram alguma água para as albufeiras do Algarve e isso é uma boa notícia, mas estamos piores do que no passado e estamos na pior situação de sempre na região\", disse aquele responsável.\nJosé Pimenta Machado falava na inauguração de uma exposição dedicada ao Dia Mundial da Água, que marca também o lançamento do projeto do Museu Nacional e Arquivo dos Recursos Hídricos, a instalar numa antiga fábrica de papel no Rio Caima, em Valmaior, Albergaria-a-Velha (Aveiro).\nEmbora o país esteja hoje, em média, com as albufeiras a 87%, referiu, persistem os problemas no litoral alentejano e no Algarve, e no futuro a previsão é a de que haja menos água, advertiu o vice-presidente da APA.\nPara aquele responsável, antes de tudo, é preciso agir para haver uma gestão da água mais eficiente, sem prejuízo de se avançar com novas barragens.\n\"Não faz sentido nenhum ter uma rede em que se perde 50% ou 60% da água\", criticou, defendendo que \"a primeira prioridade deve ser dada à eficiência dos sistemas\".\nÉ que não basta ter mais barragens, se elas não tiverem água e exemplificou: \"temos de aumentar reservas de água, mas temos hoje três barragens que ainda estão a menos de 20%, sendo duas no Algarve e uma no Alentejo\".\nNo caso particular do Algarve, a solução para o vice-presidente da APA está na dessalinização da água do mar, sendo essa a outra aposta que tem de se fazer.\n\"Vamos fazer a primeira grande central de dessalinização na zona do Algarve, em Albufeira [distrito de Faro], e é tão importante para a região\", sublinhou José Pimenta Machado.\nO dirigente lembrou que Portugal foi o primeiro país europeu a ter uma central de dessalinização, na ilha do Porto Santo, na região da Madeira, que \"funciona bem\" e é \"muito importante\" para a ilha.\nPimenta Machado visitou em Albergaria-a-Velha a reabilitação de uma vala hidráulica em São João de Loure e a exposição \"Recursos Hídricos: História, Sociedade e Saber\".\nO Algarve está em situação de alerta devido à seca desde 05 de fevereiro, tendo o Governo aprovado um conjunto de medidas de restrição ao consumo, nomeadamente a redução de 15% no setor urbano, incluindo o turismo, e de 25% na agricultura.\nA estas medidas somam-se outras como o combate às perdas nas redes de abastecimento, a utilização de água tratada na rega de espaços verdes, ruas e campos de golfe ou a suspensão da atribuição de títulos de utilização de recursos hídricos.\nO Governo já admitiu elevar o nível das restrições, declarando o estado de emergência ambiental ou de calamidade, caso as medidas agora implementadas sejam insuficientes para fazer face à escassez hídrica na região.\nLeia Também: Alterações climáticas ameaçam secar lagos Prespa no sudeste da Europa",

    "text": "The head of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) shared important reasons why “GomBurZa” is a must-watch historical biographical film. READ: [‘Tagos sa puso’: Chel Diokno ‘proud dad’ after watching ‘GomBurZa’ directed by son Pepe](https://interaksyon.philstar.com/trends-spotlights/2023/12/25/267455/chel-diokno-proud-dad-gomburza-pepe-diokno/) | [More screening of ‘Firefly,’ ‘GomBurZa’ sought after MMFF 2023 wins](https://interaksyon.philstar.com/hobbies-interests/2023/12/28/267690/more-screening-firefly-gomburza-sought-mmff-2023/) Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, CBCP president, shared his insight in a social media post regarding one of the 10 entries in this year’s prestigious Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF). He outlined his points via his Facebook page and gave five reasons why every Filipino must watch the movie. Well-researched film David shared that the film will bring back the audience to the “first spark of patriotism” that shaped the Filipino identity. He said the film beautifully portrayed how diverse groups, including Tagalogs, Kapampangans, Ilocanos, Cebuanos, natives, mestizos, criollos, and more, coalesced into one nation in the late 1800s. Produced by JesCom, world-class director The CBCP head said the fact the film is produced by the Jesuit Communications Foundation is reason alone to anticipate its quality. He also praised its director, Joses Lorenzo “Pepe” Diokno, acknowledging him as a world-class talent. GomBurZa also won the 49th MMFF’s Best Director award for Diokno. Gripping retelling of martyrdom story David explained the movie is “a gripping retelling of the story of martyrdom of these three secular priests from the perspective of a young witness—Jose Rizal y Mercado, who was mentored by his brother Paciano, who in turn was mentored by Padre Jose Burgos, and who, in turn was also mentored by Padre Pedro Pelaez. Rizal, in later years, honored these priests in his novel “El Filibusterismo.” ‘Class A’ David said “GomBurZa” movie “is class A in all regards, in terms of quality as a film production, in terms of acting, directing, screenplay, research, cinematography, sounds, etc.” “GomBurZa” is the most awarded MMFF movie this year. Aside from Best Director, the movie won Best Actor for Cedrick Juan, Best Sound, Best Production Design, Best Cinematography, Gatpuno Antonio J. Villegas Cultural Award, and second Best Picture. GomBurZa unveils essence of being true Filipino GomBurZa tells the story of three Filipino priests Mariano Gómes, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, who were executed during the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines. The film stars Dante Rivero as Padre Gomez, Cedrick Juan as Padre Burgos, and Enchong Dee as Padre Zamora. The bishop said the movie “will make you appreciate what it truly means to be a Filipino.”",

    "text": "Over 30,000 employees of the US aircraft maker Boeing were set to strike on Friday, bringing most of the aircraft production to a halt after the company's staff overwhelmingly rejected a new labor contract.\nWorkers in the US state of Oregon and the Seattle area in Washington voted 94.6% against a tentative agreement presented Sunday by Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, according to CNBC.\nThey also voted 96% in favor of a strike, significantly surpassing the two-thirds majority needed to initiate a work stoppage.\n“We strike at midnight,” IAM District 751 President Jon Holden announced during a press conference revealing the vote results.\nHolden described it as an \"unfair labor practice strike,\" claiming that factory workers had faced \"discriminatory conduct, coercive questioning, unlawful surveillance and we had unlawful promise of benefits.\"\nHe added that Boeing must negotiate in good faith.\nBoeing did not provide an immediate response.\nThe proposed agreement offered 25% wage increases and enhancements to health-care and retirement benefits, though the union had pushed for raises of around 40%. Workers criticized the deal, arguing it did not adequately address rising living costs.\n# Boeing # new labor contract # strike",

    "text": "A paramilitary group at war with Sudan’s military endorses a cease-fire during holy fasting month A Sudanese paramilitary group battling the country’s military in a nearly yearlong ruinous conflict has endorsed a resolution by the U.N. Security Council calling for a cease-fire during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan CAIRO -- A Sudanese paramilitary group battling the country’s military in a nearly yearlong ruinous conflict endorsed Saturday a resolution by the U.N. Security Council calling for a cease-fire during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The group, known as the Rapid Support Forces, said in a statement that it hopes the resolution, adopted by the U.N. Security Council on Friday, would help deliver crucially needed humanitarian assistance to millions of Sudanese trapped in the fighting across the Northeastern African country. Ramadan, during which adult Muslims are required to fast from dawn to sunset, is expected to start on or around Monday, depending on the sighting of the crescent moon. The RSF said it views the initiative as a “crucial opportunity” for the warring parties to embark on negotiations to find a political settlement to the conflict. “We view this as a crucial opportunity to initiate earnest discussions that could catalyze a political pathway. This pathway must culminate in a durable ceasefire, foster security and stability, and result in a substantive resolution that addresses the foundational issues of the historical crisis in Sudan,” it said. Sudan's military has already supported a call by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a Ramadan cease-fire. In his Thursday appeal, Guterres warned Thursday that the conflict threatens Sudan’s unity and “could ignite regional instability of dramatic proportions.” Sudan plunged into chaos in April last year, when long-simmering tensions between its military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo broke into street battles in the capital, Khartoum. The fighting broke out during Ramadan last year. Fighting spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas, but in Sudan’s western Darfur region it took on a different form, with brutal attacks by the Arab-dominated Rapid Support Forces on ethnic African civilians. Thousands of people have been killed. The 15-member Security Council voted overwhelmingly in favor of the British-drafted cease-fire resolution, with 14 countries in support and only Russia abstaining. The resolution expressed “grave concern over the spreading violence and the catastrophic and deteriorating humanitarian situation, including crisis levels, or worse, of acute [food](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Food) insecurity, particularly in Darfur.” The head of the World Food Program, Cindy McCain, said earlier this week that the conflict risks creating the world’s largest hunger crisis, with some 18 million people across Sudan facing acute hunger, including 5 million who face starvation. The conflict has uprooted more than 10 million people either to safer areas inside Sudan or to neighboring countries, according to U.N. agencies. South Sudan received 600,000 people who fled the fighting in Sudan.",

    "title": "Johnny Cornejo helps Aptos survive Soquel in tournament thriller | Boys basketball",
    "text": "SANTA CRUZ — That must-see high school basketball rivalry between Aptos and Santa Cruz has company.\nSoquel gave the Mariners all they could handle in the consolation championship at the 10th annual Aptos High/Santa Cruz Warriors NorCal Invitational on Saturday, before Johnny Cornejo pieced together a four-minute stretch that he and fans likely won’t forget anytime soon.\nCornejo scored 11 of Aptos’ 14 points in overtime, and the Mariners knocked off the Knights 60-53 at Kaiser Permanente Arena, home of the Santa Cruz Warriors, the Golden State Warriors’ NBA G League affiliate.\n“It was a good team win,” Cornejo said. “We all won together, we all contributed as a team. We moved the ball around well.”\nAsked to assess his overtime, he added: “It’s amazing. It’s a time to remember. You don’t get those times (often). You can’t take it for granted.”\nThe teams still have, at least, two meetings this season in Santa Cruz Coast Athletic League play: Jan. 9 in Aptos and Jan. 26 in Soquel. And they could meet play in the SCCAL Tournament. Mark you calendars.\n“Soquel brings it every time,” Cornejo said. “We’ve got to bring it right back on the defensive end. That’s how we win games. Our defense is the key to us winning. And then it’s offense, after the defense.”\nCornejo finished with 19 points. He scored his team’s first nine points in the extra stanza. Mateo Calfee, an all-tournament selection, made three free throws in overtime and finished with a team-high 21 points.\nSoquel’s Braylon Noble scored all seven of his team’s points in overtime and finished with 21 points. Tyler Harway scored 15 points. Center-turned-guard Cade Petersen, who is 6-foot-2, 230 pounds, finished with 11 points — all in the second half. He made three of his team’s 11 3s.\n“That kinda changes the scouting report on Cade, doesn’t it?” Mariners coach Brian Bowyer said. “He’s knocking ’em down. And when he missed them, they look good. Every shot that comes out of his hand looks good.”\nAptos (9-5) played without star Isaiah Ackerman, who missed his second straight game with an ankle sprain.\nSoquel was without ill Nico Ramirez, and vacationing Peyton Bortz and Liam Wennstrom.\n“Wait til you see what comes,” Knights coach Greg Baskovich said of his absent players. “It’s all perimeter coming.”\nThe Knights (5-8) also saw Steeley Deans suffer a likely concussion after he collided with Cornejo while pursuing a loose ball in the final seconds of the first half.\n“I expect this is what it’s going to be with them every game,” Mariners coach Brian Bowyer said. “It’s going to be nip-and-tuck, it’s going to be tight. It’s fun and it’s the way high school basketball is supposed to be. These guys will remember this game. It’s just fun basketball.”\nCalfee made a couple of layups that helped Aptos jump out to an 11-0 lead. Harway banked in a 3-pointer and made a layup as Soquel closed the quarter with an 8-3 run.\nAptos outscored Soquel 13-11 in the second quarter and carried a 27-19 lead into the half. Noble scored all 11 points for the Knights.\nCade Peterson made a 3, Harway made two layups, and Jones buried a 3 to knot the score at 29-all in the third quarter.\n“We always come back,” Baskovich said. “We always start slow. I don’t know what it is.”\nAptos responded with an 8-0 run to enter the fourth leading 37-29.\nSoquel, fueled by four 3s, went on a 16-1 run to take a seven-point lead, 45-38, with 54.7 second remaining. But Aptos adjusted to Soquel’s zone defense and closed regulation with a 8-1 run — Cornejo made a 3-pointer and Calfee made and-one basket and two free throws.\nBoth teams missed a 3-point shot over the final 9.8 seconds.\nFour minutes were added to the game clock for overtime. Soquel won the jump ball but turned the ball over on a shot-clock violation. That was the cue for Cornejo to take the game over.\nHe made four free throws, two layups, and a 3-pointer. After his 3, he held three fingers up so everyone could admire the hottest hand in the facility.\n“He just steps up in big times for us, when we need shots,” Bowyer said. “He’s kinda one of those very streaky players. He can go a quarter and a half and not even get a shot up. But when he feels it, when he makes a shot, he can get going. And you could tell he felt it.”\nBowyer was concerned with Soquel heading into the game, and the Knights validated his belief. They had five players join the team late after helping their school’s football team win the CIF 4-AA State Championship on Dec. 8.\n“The longer this season goes, the better Soquel is going to be,” Bowyer said. “And they’re just going to keep getting better and better. They’re already good.”\nBaskovich’s team was on the losing end, but he was in good spirits after the setback.\n“I just told them I’m really proud,” he said. “We’re getting better.”\nTHE SCORES\nBoys\nSeventh place: North Monterey County d.

    "text": "- Arsenal fell to a 2-0 home defeat against West Ham on Thursday night - The Gunners missed an opportunity to leapfrog Liverpool and go top of the table - Watch out Liverpool and Arsenal! Man City are ready to do what they always do and hit top gear at this stage of the season – Listen to It’s All Kicking Off Mikel Arteta has insisted that Arsenal failed to ‘make a difference inside the box’ during their 2-0 defeat to West Ham on Thursday. The Gunners stunned by their London rivals after goals from Thomas Soucek and Konstantinos Mavropanos wrapped up all three points for the visitors on the night. The result saw Arsenal fail to overtake Liverpool and assert themselves at the top of the Premier League table, as the Hammers moved up to sixth. Speaking after the game, the Gunners boss suggested that his attackers failed to make a difference in the attacking third. Speaking on Amazon Prime after the game, Arteta said: ‘West Ham won the game but I think we deserved much more. Arsenal slipped up in the title race after a disappointing 2-0 defeat to West Ham on Thursday Afterwards, Mikel Arteta suggested his side did not have enough of an impact in the box Your browser does not support iframes. ‘We tried, and tried and tried but the difference was maybe in the boxes. You have to make the difference in the boxes’. Then, talking to BBC Sport, he continued: ‘We want to be at the top and today we are very, very disappointed. We had so much dominance in the game. ‘We are in a really good position. Today is a disappointing night. We have to pick ourselves up for a big game against Fulham.’ ‘It is what it is. The technology we have at the moment is not clear enough if the ball is out. ‘We dominated for 100 minutes. When we had big situations, we had players inside the box totally free. I think the players put an enormous effort in. ‘It’s a difficult dressing room right now but we have another game in 72 hours. This is football, we have to improve in certain areas.’ Arsenal had 30 shots in total during the game – compared to West Ham’s six – but still failed to come away with a point at the very least from the game. This year, Arsenal’s top goalscorers in the league are Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah, who have five top-flight goals each. The Gunners now sit two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool in the table IT’S ALL KICKING OFF!

Various TV replays couldn’t categorically prove whether the ball had gone out. However, Mark Clattenburg claimed that the strike had to stand as there wasn’t conclusive evidence that the ball had gone out before Jarrod Bowen sent in a cross. Speaking on Amazon Prime, Clattenburg said: ‘There’s no other decision the officials can give. The on-field decision is a goal. We cannot be 100 per cent certain that the ball has gone out. As the ball has to be clearly over the line, there’s no conclusive evidence.’ *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12908305/Mikel-Arteta-claims-Arsenal-failed-make-difference-inside-box-fall-home-defeat-against-West-Ham-Spaniard-insists-Gunners-dominated-100-minutes.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

Segundo dados da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), divulgados nesta quinta-feira (18), 168 novas usinas entraram em funcionamento nos seis primeiros meses de 2024. Somente em junho, 27 unidades começaram a operar, sendo 13 eólicas, 10 fotovoltaicas e quatro termelétricas. [+ Conta de luz fica mais cara em julho](https://sbtnews.sbt.com.br/noticia/economia/conta-de-luz-fica-mais-cara-a-partir-desta-segunda-feira) Apesar dos dados positivos, a previsão da Aneel é de que a geração de energia elétrica tenha um crescimento de 10,1 gigawatts, menor do que a alta registrada no ano anterior, de 10,3 GW. Fontes renováveis De acordo com a Aneel, a quantidade máxima de produção de energia no Brasil é de 203,8 GW. Dessa capacidade total das usinas em operação, 84,6% são de fontes renováveis. As quatro maiores fontes renováveis na composição da matriz de energia elétrica brasileira são a hídrica (53,88%), eólica (15,22%), biomassa (8,31%) e solar (7,2%). Já entre as não renováveis, as mais expressivas são gás natural (8,78%), petróleo (3,92%) e carvão mineral (1,7%).",

La direction d'Air Canada a demandé jeudi au gouvernement fédéral un arbitrage obligatoire avant le conflit, une démarche qui a déjà été utilisée en 2011 et 2012, sous les conservateurs, avec Lisa Raitt. «Je suis absolument contre», note Michèle Boisvert. «Non, vraiment... Avant même le déclenchement? Je me pose une sérieuse question: est-ce que Air Canada est vraiment un service essentiel? «Lorsque le gouvernement a décidé d'appliquer l'article 107 pour la grève dans le rail, j'ai salué, parce que, premièrement, la grève avait été déclenchée.

    "text": "“Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin… Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money and control credit, and with a flick of a pen they will create enough to buy it back.” ~ Josiah Stamp Sometimes things seem so complicated, that most simply avoid any effort to understand the problems facing them. Very little of anything is too complicated or too complex for any thinking individual to understand, so breaking things down to a level that is more easily understandable is often necessary for clarity. These efforts can be helped along by those with knowledge about important issues, who take the time to explain them in such a manner, that little expertise is necessary to figure out the basis of the matter at hand. A great impediment to this dilemma, is the fact that the State has over many decades, attempted, and most successfully, to dumb-down the population at large, by taking over the ‘schooling’ of each generation almost from birth until full adulthood and beyond, thereby harming the intellect of large numbers of ‘society’ to such an extent, as to effectively negate meaningful dialogue. [12 Rules for Life: An ...](https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021?SubscriptionId=AKIAI63WS3YGA3Y5U2QA&tag=lrc18-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0345816021) Best Price: $8.00 Buy New $11.56 (as of 10:53 UTC - Details) The result of this manufactured and manipulated outcome, has been the plotted creation of a blind, ignorant, and indifferent population, with voluminous propaganda being used as a tool of deception. This has led to mass slavery, even though the crowd for the most part, still believes due to extreme gullibility and brainwashing, that they are somehow free. This solidifies the statement made by Von Goethe, that “None are so enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free.” This country is the epitome of this reality, but few recognize the existence and scope of the extreme uncertainty confronting us, and the dire consequences of the mass inaction of the herd in the face of the staggering challenges ahead. Our plight, at least in the economic and financial sense, has been recently explained by David Rogers Webb, in his documentary, [“The Great Taking.”](https://thegreattaking.com/) This is very well done so far as explaining much of what has happened, how it happened, and the players involved on Wall Street, in government and by so-called ‘law-makers,’ political regulators, corporate heads, and the central bankers, whose ability to create unlimited sums of currency has plunged this country into economic hell. A lot of what he is saying in this production is spot on, and does get very technical concerning the structuring of assets so as to place ownership of nearly everything intangible on earth in the hands of the few at the top of the banking cabal. Where he completely fails, is in his very confused ideas concerning the solutions to this takeover plot. On one hand, he nails the problems, but on the other, he destroys all his efforts due to his gross ignorance and misunderstanding of government and the power structures bent on controlling everything. It is astounding to me that Webb understands so much about the corruption, dishonesty, and intricate criminal workings of those who control the ‘money,’ but fails miserably in his assessment of how to go about fixing these problems. This is not uncommon, as most everyone seeks solutions from outside themselves, and inside the very failed system that has always been the problem. This is of course backward, but by accepting the system and attempting to change and reform it using that same system, negates any risk or responsibility of the individual, and places all efforts on ‘trusting’ others to be honest and noble for the benefit of the evil and moronic idea of the ‘greater good.’ Let’s just get ‘better people’ in government; let’s tell government not to seek power or expand; let’s just ‘educate’ the ruling class, because they really do not want this, but only inherited this ownership layer of power. “They (Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Royals, Presidents) did not design this, they did not put it into motion, they have allowed the juggernaut to continue; they are not particularly capable people.” All we have to do according to Webb, is push the ‘awareness’ of the insanity of wanting to control everything, to the top levels of all the “muscle,” (politicians, agency heads, corporate heads, CIA, military brass, etc.) who enforce the criminal behavior of the real rulers, so that they will see the error of their ways, because “they did not know anything about this” plot. So all we have to do is reach people at high levels, in order to expect them to save us. With Webb’s thinking, we do not need to get rid of this heinous system, all we need to do is repair it. We do not need a privately-owned central bank, (of course not) we need to have a central bank run like a ‘public’ utility, or in other words, the government should run the central bank and return all profits to the ‘public’ (government) and for the support of that same government. This is what I would refer to as a socialistic, communistic, nationalistic, and fascist, utopian monetary plan, based on pure fantasy. According to Webb, “We have to have government. We have to have someone to ‘operate’ society.” “Anarchy and chaos; (opposites) we can’t have that.” His notion is that everything has to be done ‘legally,’ which only means by the forced and enforced rules of the State. All we have to do is to make government smaller, limited, and beneficial to humanity. Ah, so simple? Enough of this poppycock, love and respect of the evil State, its laws, and the expectation that by informing the ruling class that it is not being good, that they will understand their complicity in evil, and voluntarily reverse everything they have done perpetually throughout history, and only act as benevolent masters and ‘leaders,’ ministers of peace for humanity, and lowly saints of man. All this nonsense means is that a full reliance on educating the near top level of rule, so that they will speak out against what is happening; those high level politicians, billionaires, corporate heads, and banking magnates, and then the ‘system’ will repair itself for the betterment of mankind. All assets on earth are on the chopping block, as all assets are coming under the control of the ruling master class. The electronic takeover of all monetary, credit, and debt systems, total control the internet, and the all-consuming growth of artificial ‘intelligence,’ are going ahead full steam, and once in place universally, once all monetary transactions are digital, once CBDCs and other central bank monetary units (fed coins, etc.) are in place, and when currencies are cleared and controlled from a global central source or sources, the total loss of control by individuals, will be the result. All property will be subject to confiscation and management by the State, including the very lives of the sheep. [Atomic Habits: An Easy...](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735211299?tag=lrc18-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) Best Price: $8.49 Buy New $12.50 (as of 06:00 UTC - Details) The bankers own the earth, (and all politicians) and will never give up their power to create money out of thin air, and without limit. Even if government was to somehow take over the monetary system and control the central bank, a joke to be sure, it would never rectify this gross corruption, or act in favor of the people. The entire system is the problem; government is the problem, so in order for any escape from this insanity, in order to ever regain any aspect of real freedom, this entire system, all of it, must be abolished. Nothing of value can ever come from seeking redress from the same government that is the oppressor of humanity. No government or ruling class controlling government, will ever limit its own power in favor of individual sovereignty, for that would automatically negate any need of government or rule. No government or rule should exist, as it is completely immoral for any man to rule another by force. The natural state of man is to be free, and this is the responsibility of each and every individual; each and every one of you. “Between the government which does evil and the people who accept it – there is a certain shameful solidarity.” Victor Hugo Reference links: [The End of the World as We Know It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYyTyXpdQRI&t=2s) [Harmonizing central bank digital currencies for cross-border transactions](https://web.archive.org/web/20230617234012/https:/www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-harmonising-central-bank-digital-currencies/)",
