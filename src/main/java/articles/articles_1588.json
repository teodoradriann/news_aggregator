    "text": "Unprecedented Flooding Displaces Hundreds Of Thousands Across East Africa\n“Unprecedented and devastating” flooding in East Africa has triggered widespread displacement with hundreds of thousands forced from their homes in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Ethiopia and Tanzania, UN humanitarians warned on Wednesday.\nIn an alert, the International\nOrganization for Migration (\nIOM) noted that\ntorrential rains have unleashed catastrophic flooding and\nmudslides while also severely damaging roads, bridges and\ndams.\nMore than 637,000 people have been affected by weeks of deluges, including 234,000 displaced in just the last five days. There is no official figure for the number of dead.\nNever-ending emergency\n“The numbers [of displaced people] keep rising,” the UN agency said, noting that the flooding emergency was one of the “harsh realities” of climate change, which has claimed lives and uprooted entire communities.\n“As these individuals face the daunting task of rebuilding, their vulnerability only deepens,” said Rana Jaber, IOM's regional director.\n“In this critical moment, even as IOM responds, the call remains urgent for sustainable efforts to address human mobility spurred by a changing climate,” she continued.\nAfrica is highly vulnerable to climate change despite contributing only about four per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions. The eastern and Horn of Africa areas have particularly been impacted by alternating cycles of drought and intense precipitation over the last decade, IOM maintained.\nAmid the worst rains and flooding in decades, IOM along with governments and partners continue to provide lifesaving assistance to affected populations who have lost family members and now face a heightened risk of waterborne disease.\nIn Burundi, IOM has distributed emergency shelter, blankets, cooking utensils, solar lamps, dignity kits and other items to more than 5,000 people. The UN agency also supports the relocation of people at risk to safe and less flood-prone areas.\nHelp is also underway in neighbouring Ethiopia to more than 70,000 flood-affected people across Somali and Oromia regions and to 39,000 people in Kenya’s most severely flood-affected east, centre and west and in Somalia, where some 240,000 people are to receive shelter materials, hygiene kits, essential medical care and psychosocial support, among other services.\nClimate talks imperative\nAhead of UN-led discussions in Germany in June to tackle climate change, IOM said it was increasingly “evident” that any discussions on our warming planet and its impact on the environment should now include considerations of human mobility and displacement.\nEast African leaders have already\nsigned and committed to the Kampala Ministerial\nDeclaration on Migration, Environment and Climate\nChange to address the “challenges and the\nopportunities of climate mobility”, IOM said, but greater\nefforts are needed to support its implementation,\n“including advocating for the inclusion of climate\nmobility at global climate discussions\" such as the upcoming\nUN Climate Change Conference (\nCOP29) in November 2024,\ntaking place in Baku,\nAzerbaijan.",

    "title": "Google finally adds ability to search the web on NotebookLM",
    "text": "NotebookLM, arguably one of Google’s most slept-on AI products, just got a pretty powerful update — web search integration. If you're not familiar with it, NotebookLM is Google’s AI-powered notebook that works off your own stuff, including PDFs, Google Docs, Slides, websites, and more. You can feed it your sources, and it helps you generate summaries, briefings, FAQs, and now, curated search results.\nThe new feature is called Discover Sources, and it basically lets you search the web directly from inside your notebook. When a user describes their topic, NotebookLM scans through hundreds of web sources in seconds. It picks out up to 10 of the most relevant ones, complete with annotated summaries that explain why each source might matter to your topic. With just a single click, you can pull them into your notebook and add them as part of your sources.\nTo try it:\n- Go to\nnotebooklm.google.com - Open up a notebook.\n- In the Sources panel, tap the Discover button.\n- Describe what you’re interested in.\nThis isn’t the only upgrade. Earlier this year, NotebookLM added YouTube video support, where you can paste a public video URL, and it becomes part of your source stack. You can get summaries and citations and view the video in an embedded player. Google also added support for Audio Overview to NotebookLM, which turns documents, charts, slides, etc., into narrated AI audio briefings that can be shared with others as well.\nNotebookLM is available for both regular users and organizations. If you're in an EDU or enterprise setup, Workspace admins can enable it domain-wide.\nNotebookLM still feels like one of Google’s most underrated and underused tools. It can be helpful, especially for students, writers, analysts, or anyone dealing with messy research. With updates like this, it’s starting to look like something that could actually change how we do research with AI.\nSource: Google",

REUTERS/Peter Cziborra/File Photo\nBoeing's U.S. West Coast factory workers will walk off the job after 96% voted on Thursday in favor of a strike, halting production of the planemaker's strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt.\nThe workers' first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time (0700 GMT) as Friday begins, just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January.\nRoughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years.\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members voted 96% in favor of striking and 94.6% to reject the agreement.\n\"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for IAM, Boeing's largest union, before announcing the vote result.\n\"We strike at midnight,\" he said, as members in the union hall cheered and chanted: \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\"\nBoeing said late on Thursday the vote sent a clear message that the tentative deal it had reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to members.\n\"We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,\" the planemaker said in a statement.\nThe deal included a general wage increase of 25%, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program was launched within the four years of the contract.\nAlthough IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40% pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\n\"We're going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. \"This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time.”\nWorkers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing's MAX, 777 and 767 jets.\nBoeing shares closed up 0.9% on Thursday before the vote results were announced but are down 36% this year on concerns over safety, production and a $60 billion debt burden.\nThe duration of the walkout is not clear. A long strike would weigh not only on Boeing's financials, but on airlines that depend on the planemaker’s jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft.\nAccording to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion of cash flow.\nThe Boeing workers' last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day.\nS&P Global Ratings said that an extended strike could delay the planemaker's recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody's rate Boeing one notch above junk status.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. - Reuters\nOpen Modal × Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

    "title": "In ‘The Boys’ Season 4, conspiracy theories work just like in the real world",
    "text": "Even if\nThe Boys is known for its bloody take on superheroes, the show often does a fantastic job with political parody. In Season 4, The Boys perfectly summarizes why conspiracy theories are so popular.\nThe first three episodes of The Boys Season 4, now available on Amazon’s Prime Video, follow the black ops team as they try to learn more about Homelander’s (Antony Starr) dangerous new plan. After killing a civilian in public, Vought’s mightiest superhero has decided to play the political game in broad daylight instead of hiding in the shadows. To do that, Homelander enlists Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), the most intelligent person on the planet.\nWhile following Sage, the Boys end up at Truthcon, a convention dedicated to conspiracy theories. The episode makes fun of some of the most popular conspiracy theories, such as Flat Earth and Lizard People. However, it also takes time to explain why many people dedicate their lives to conspiracy theories.\nThe Boys uses Firecracker to explain the appeal of conspiracy theories\nSister Sage is at Truthcon to enlist Firecracker (Valorie Curry), the head of a podcast named Truthbomb. In her podcast, Firecracker promises to reveal the “truth” about Starlight (Erin Moriarty) to hundreds of followers. As expected, that “truth” is just a bunch of nonsense about how Starlight helps multiple Hollywood figures find underaged sex slaves.\nFirecracker’s audience applauds her supposed courage to talk about what the media “hides” from the U.S. citizens, and her words make Homelander followers angrier against Starlighters. It’s easy to understand why Sister Sage wants to bring Firecracker onboard her plan, as she aims to increase the schism between the two sides of the polarized political landscape.\nSister Sage doesn’t care what Firecracker truly thinks; the podcaster is just another pawn in her dangerous game. Yet, Sage still pressures Firecracker to admit she’s making up stories to increase her audience numbers. Firecracker eventually tells Sage the truth, underlining how she’s selling “purpose.” That is a powerful line that perfectly summarizes real-world conspiracy theorists.\nFrom the outside, it’s easy to see conspiracy theories are mostly fabricated gibberish. It’s even easier to make fun of whoever believes in these twisted discourses. However, Firecracker knows that people hold tight to conspiracy theories because their world doesn’t make sense anymore.\nConspiracy theories offer individuals the opportunity to regain a sense of control over their own lives. The economy is in shambles, people struggle to put food on their tables and have a roof over their heads, the environment is being destroyed by a handful of greedy corporations, and billionaires increase their profit margins every day. It’s hard to be hopeful about the future and feel that your actions matter in the long run. So, conspiracy theories give a straightforward answer that people can use to pin the blame for everything on a particular group of enemies that must be destroyed at all costs.\nFurthermore, conspiracy theories are also incredibly popular with more conservatives because the world feels even more chaotic to them. People who hold tight to archaic ideas of gender, sexuality, and race feel less at home in a world that’s progressively becoming more accepting of differences. That’s why so many conspiracy theories paint minorities as villains, as this gives a sense of comfort and allows them to reinterpret the world through the lenses they are used to wearing.\nThere are whole communities built around conspiracy theories, safe spaces where disoriented people can find structure and genuine human bonds — or, as Firecracker puts it, purpose. That’s why it’s so hard to dismantle conspiracist groups, especially since most people prefer to see these people as lunatics who should be joked about. This attitude only increases the abysm between “us” and “them,” ultimately making society more hostile and pushing even more people to search for purpose in conspiracy theories.\nIt’s impressive that The Boys has such clarity about the workings of conspiracy theories. Since 4 echoes the bipartisan division of U.S. politics, it would be easier just to pick a side and paint the other one as simply evil and dumb. Yet, Season 4 genuinely tries to understand what makes people believe in the most farfetched stories ever, and how power-hungry media figures use conservatism to make money. It’s not enough to bash conspiracy theorists; it’s equally essential to recognize how the lack of perspective facilitates the choice for extremism.\n ",

    "title": "Winter Weather conditions causes safety hazards for drivers",
    "text": "Winter Weather conditions causes safety hazards for drivers QUINCY (WGEM) - Winter weather has made roads and bridges across the Tri-States very slippery which has led to several accidents already. Drivers often get in a hurry and are not paying attention on the road causing a lot of accidents around this time of year. Winter weather conditions can cause a variety of safety hazards for drivers. “As soon as it drops to 32 degrees or right in that area with a little bit of mist and rain we had last night it’s going to make icy spots,” said Canton Fire Chief Joe LaCount. Taking extra precautions when those conditions arrive in the Tri-states can make a big difference. “So that makes it harder to drive in and as always visibility is lower at times so you got to be more cautious and paying attention to people around you and what’s going on,” said Adams County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Logan Peter. Officials said during the winter, it’s best to give yourself plenty of driving time to ensure your safety. “When the temperature drops its best to drop your speed a little and really pay attention to the road conditions ahead of you,” LaCount said. Bridges and overpasses are also very dangerous during winter weather conditions since icy spots can be difficult for drivers to see. “Cold air can often get under the roadway there and it causes the moisture on the road to freeze so they’ll freeze before other parts of the roadway will,” Peter said. “So when you’re on the highway and you come out from underneath an overpass or bridge the roads can change really quickly right there,” LaCount said. To avoid any accidents you should plan you trips ahead of time and always be sure to check the weather conditions before you leave. “Give yourself an extra few minutes to get to where you’re going, leave in plenty of time and expect to need to drive slower to where you’re going,” Peter said. First responders advise drivers to make sure vehicles get regularly serviced and prepped for winter weather conditions before driving to ensure smoother travels. Copyright 2023 WGEM.

    "text": "The capitulation was abject, the surrender complete. Having come to South Africa entertaining visions of finally securing a Test series win in the only country where it has remained elusive so far, Indias hopes were buried just three days into the series at SuperSport Park on Thursday. Having seen Dean Elgar and Marco Jansen extend South Africas first-innings advantage in the first Test to a commanding 163, India faced the daunting task of batting with application and purpose if they were to make a match of it. Instead, in a lacklustre display totally out of sync with their standing as the No. 1 Test side, India rolled over for just 131 in 34.1 overs in the second innings, well beaten by an innings and 32 runs with more than two days remaining. Also Read:India slump to their biggest defeat on South African soil in Test history SAs Nandre Burger celebrates KL Rahuls wicket yesterday. Pic/Getty Images Kohli wages lone battle Even South Africa must have been pleasantly surprised at the rapidity with which Indias batsmen departed the crease, in unseemly hurry as strokes were played with gay abandon. Virat Kohlis stylish 76 was no more than a consolation, the top-order fired out as much because of their adventurism as the discipline of the South African bowling. As is to be expected, there were a clutch of excellent deliveries, including the one from Kagiso Rabada in the third over that slanted into Rohit Sharma and seamed away on pitching to hit off-stump, but there were also outlandish strokes with no respect for the game situation or the conditions. South Africa put down two catches, including off the first delivery of the Indian second innings when Aiden Markram failed to grab an offering low to his right at first slip off Yashasvi Jaiswal. Yet, India continued to look a gift horse in the mouth, failing to tread the thin line between aggression and indiscretion judiciously. Debutant Burger claims four That only two batsmen, Kohli and Shubman Gill, topped double digits must also be a source of worry. South Africas pace battery did just about enough, but they didnt need to do more, not with India in such generous wicket-surrendering mode after having seen the opposition pile on the runs. Nandre Burger, who had an excellent debut, finished with four wickets while Jansen added to his career-best unbeaten 84 with a three-wicket burst including the scalps with identical full balls of Gill and Shreyas Iyer. Jansen had taken the lead role in the morning when South Africa resumed at 256 for five in reply to Indias 245. The game was still in the balance but there was no joy for Indias bowlers as the sixth-wicket alliance burgeoned to 111. Jasprit Bumrah was tireless and unflagging and R Ashwin asked tricky questions on a seam-friendly surface, but the other pacers again disappointed, too full or too short and mercilessly punished. Elgars seven-and-a-quarter-hour vigil that fetched him 185 was finally ended by Shardul Thakur. India finished well short of that tally in their second dig, comprehensively schooled by the hosts. Brief scoresIndia 245 & 131 all out (V Kohli 76; N Burger 4-33, M Jansen 3-36, K Rabada 2-32) lost to South Africa 408 (D Elgar 185, M Jansen 84*, D Bedingham 56; J Bumrah 4-69, M Siraj 2-91) by an innings and 32 runs",

    "text": "Los campeones arrancan a buen ritmo, aunque sin gol en Belgrado La selección española avasalló a Serbia en el segundo tiempo, pero las buenas jugadas, sobre todo de Lamine Yamal, no recibieron premio España arrancó con un punto en Belgrado en el estreno de la nueva edición de la UEFA Nations League. El equipo dejó otra vez una impresión muy positiva, aunque en esta ocasión no tuvo la magia de acertar ante la meta contraria para llevarse la merecida victoria De la Fuente se decantó por Dani Olmo en la media punta y Pedri se quedó en el banquillo. [Lamine, recuperado de su golpe, y Nico Williams tuvieron en esta ocasión a Ayoze como referencia](/deportes/2024/09/04/fuente-lamine-golpe-jugar-serbia-107757949.html) ofensiva con la baja de Morata. El otro cambio obligado por sanción y cantado fue el de Zubimendi por Rodri. Serbia salió con su habitual sistema de tres centrales y con una brutal pitada al técnico Dragan Stojkovic de una afición aún dolida por la tempranera eliminación en la Eurocopa. La media entrada que se registró en el 'Pequeño Marakaná' fue la mejor muestra del desencanto con la selección. Los precedentes, sin embargo, no son un barómetro preciso en el inicio de una nueva temporada y ni el campeón de Europa podía confiarse ni los serbios tirar la toalla antes de empezar. Aunque España salió dominando y controlando el balón, Serbia pudo marcar nada más empezar en un veloz contragolpe desbaratado en última instancia por Laporte y un lanzamiento desviado encima de la portería de David Raya. La Roja debía imponer su estilo, aunque vio pronto que tampoco debía desprotegerse. Pese a ello, Carvajal sufría por la derecha y Jovic dispuso de la segunda ocasión local. Jovic perdona la más clara La Roja debía mejorar su juego plano ofensivo y tratar de ser más vertical. Lamine Yamal y Nico Williams eran las válvulas de escape frente a un rival que tenía claro su plan: defender muy juntos y salir a la contra. Con los extremos más participativos y un Dani Olmo omnipresente llegó la primera oportunidad española con una volea alta de Carvajal. Lamine y Nico se activaron y Serbia empezó a sufrir. Sus disparos empezaron a llegar y meter el miedo en el cuerpo aún más a sus rivales. Entre el azulgrana y Olmo fabricaron una jugada preciosa con remate final de Ayoze detenido por Rajkovic. La réplica fue inmediata con Jovic y Le Normand rompiendo el fuera de juego, fallando de forma increíble solo ante Raya. El partido se animó y Fabián cruzó la pelota en medio de la locura. El medio tiempo sirvió para calmar los ánimos a un partido muy disputado, con cinco amarillas solo en 45 minutos. Sin tregua El alto ritmo continuó en el segundo tiempo con una falta lanzada por Ilic al lateral de la red. Serbia se lo creía y veía que cada vez que aceleraba creaba peligro. De la Fuente contestó con cambios de calidad situando a Grimaldo y Oyarzabal. Las sustituciones dieron aire a España para frenar los arreones balcánicos. Grimaldo dejó su sella que obligó a volar a Rajkovic, con rechace posterior para Lamine, quien acarició el gol con su rosca. España se sentía por fin superior al rival y se veía con más opciones de ganar. El ex portero del Mallorca se volvió a lucir frente al blaugrana y Fabián perdonó en el área pequeña tras una recuperación del de Rocafonda. De la Fuente quería ganar y situó a Pedri para los últimos minutos. El equipo estaba volcado y solo faltaba tener mayor claridad en el área contraria. Con el juego solo en campo serbio, el de la rioja subió su apuesta con dos hombres de área como Joselu y Ferran. El ex madridista pudo ser víctima de un penalti nada más entrar.

    "text": "AGARTALA: After TIPRA Motha, former chief minister and CPM politburo member Manik Sarkar hit out at the BJP accusing it of creating division in tribal society on religious lines while criticising the move of Janajati Suraksha Mancha (JSM) to scrap ST benefits of converted tribals.Addressing party cadres here on Thursday, Sarkar said, “The rally JSM held two days ago was a new beginning to disintegrate tribals. The seeds of religious division are being sown in the tribal communities and innocent brothers and sisters living in the hilly areas are being misguided once again.”Slamming TIPRA Motha party for playing second fiddle to the ruling BJP in the recently held assembly elections, he said, “They (JSM) are not much different from TIPRA Motha. What happened in the last assembly elections, TIPRA Motha maintained a clandestine relation with the BJP and remained vocal against its policies in public.”Sarkar said TIPRA Motha, disregarding the attempts of opposition-fielded candidates in non-ST reserved seats, helped the BJP to win at least 20 seats and retain power. As the trick was exposed after the election results were declared, now the new slogan of religious incitement was raised to divide tribal society, he alleged.We also published the following articles recently Rights bodies oppose rally for delisting of converted tribalsCivil rights groups write letter to Jharkhand government, seeking vigilance and legal action against hate speeches at a rally organized by Janjanti Surakha Manch, an affiliate of RSS-backed Vanvashi Kalyan Kendra. The rally is demanding the removal of converted tribals from the Scheduled Tribes list. The groups allege that the rally is intended to create communal disharmony and divide tribals in the name of Sarna-Christianity. They express surprise at the government for granting permission for such a program.106243177 Party worried after Cong leader rallies against tribals delisting bidCongress faces challenge ahead of Lok Sabha elections as working president announces mega rally to counter bid to delist tribals converting to Christianity and Islam. Rally aimed at appeasing Christian tribals, but could upset tribal electorate who follow Sarna faith. State Congress insiders express concern over lack of consultation with JPCC's political affairs committee and working committee. JPCC working to tap into tribal voters to emerge from shadows of JMM. Former MLA Tirkey states rally not under party banner, invites like-minded tribal rights activist bodies. JPCC president Thakur states inability to comment on rally conducted on personal capacity.106335091 Tribals plan Delhi protest on delisting converts from ST listThousands of tribals from across India will converge in New Delhi in February to demand the removal of converted tribals from the ST list. The campaign is backed by the RSS and other Hindu groups. A recent rally in Ranchi, organized by the Janjati Suraksha Manch (JSM), saw 5000 tribals protesting against the social and financial advantages received by converted tribals. Supporters of de-listing argue that converted tribals receive support from foreign funds, reservation benefits, and government benefits as a religious minority. The JSM plans to hold the next rally in New Delhi, where tribals will demand reservation benefits for those who are genuinely deprived and following their traditional practices.106278286",
