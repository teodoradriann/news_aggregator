Ferdinand Topacio)\nFugitive and expelled lawmaker Arnolfo Teves Jr. has been placed under house arrest in Timor-Leste, the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed on Thursday.\n“He will be under 24-hour security, with only family members permitted to visit him,” the DOJ said in a statement, adding that the Philippine government would closely monitor the situation to ensure that all procedures were “valid and appropriate.”\nADVERTISEMENT Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said in a separate statement that whether the former congressman would be in custody, rearrested or under house arrest, he was still “under the control of the police authorities.”\nFEATURED STORIES GLOBALNATION PH would no longer send ships to Rimpac exercises, only observers GLOBALNATION Ateneo leads 56 Philippine universities in 2024 THE Impact Rankings GLOBALNATION Philippines is among world’s worst countries for workers again “Simply put, he is deprived of liberty. Ongoing extradition hearings now,” Vasquez said. Teves’ legal counsel in the Philippines, lawyer Ferdinand Topacio said the Timorese court issued the order to place his client under house arrest on Wednesday.\nREAD: Teves released from detention in Timor-Leste, says his lawyer\n“After having determined that he is not a flight risk and that he has not violated any laws, he was placed under guard in his residence simply to ensure his attendance in the hearings,” Topacio said. Timor-Leste media agency Hatutan.com first reported the decision of the Court of Appeals in Dili to place the lawmaker under house arrest while awaiting his extradition proceedings.\nStill a flight risk In a GMA News report that cited data from Hatutan.com, the Timorese court reportedly noted that Teves was living in a rented house with a monthly rent of $10,000 with his wife and two children.\nHe was also reportedly working as a partner in a construction firm, receiving financial support from the owner. “Given the facts above, it is concluded that the risk of flight persists for extraditee, especially since he has the financial means to leave Timor-Leste,” the court said, contrary to Topacio’s statement that his client was no longer a flight risk.\nTeves, who fled to Timor-Leste to evade prosecution for multiple charges, including murder, in the Philippines, was arrested by authorities on March 21. He has been tagged as the brains in the March 2023 killing of his political rival, former Negros Oriental Gov.

    "title": "The Meaning Behind Kacey Musgraves’ Defiant Ode to Relaxation (and Maybe an Acid-Fueled Trip or Two), “Slow Burn”",
    "text": "When\nKacey Musgraves got her first inklings of what would become the lyrics for “ Slow Burn,” she was having what she has referred to as a “spiritual journey” while on LSD. She took the idea for the song to her collaborators, Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk, who came up with a busy and elaborate production for the song that was meant to hammer home the profundity of Musgraves’ experience.\nVideos by American Songwriter\nShe vetoed many of the overdubs her co-writers had come up with, wanting to keep the song simple. Musgraves knew what she was doing, as “Slow Burn”’s lyrics are more than sufficient to convey the experience she had while tripping on her front porch. So let’s get in a relaxed mood and settle in for an exploration of Musgraves’ ode to taking life at a leisurely pace.\nMusgraves’ Trippy Epiphany\nThe song that eventually became the leadoff track for Musgraves’ 2018 album,\nGolden Hour, began with a simple thought. In an interview for the New York Times’ “Diary of a Song” series, Musgraves said the germ of the tune came when she thought to herself, “Man, I love a slow burn.” Once she convened with Tashian and Fitchuk and started working on the lyrics for the verses, Musgraves established at the outset of the song that this is how she has always been.\nBorn in a hurry, always late\nHaven’t been early since ‘88\nThis opening couplet alludes both to her premature birth and her lifelong proclivity for taking things slowly. From there, Musgraves details some of the different ways in which she appreciates a slow approach.\nGood in a glass, good on green\nGood when you’re putting your hands all over me\nMusgraves can add letting a song unfold to the list of things she likes to do slowly, as the four-plus minutes of “Slow Burn” contain just two verses, two choruses, a three-word bridge (Whatever feels good), and an outro. In the second verse, Musgraves deepens her introspection, thinking about how In Tennessee, the sun’s goin’ down / But in Beijing, they’re headin’ out to work. And her response to that realization is literally to stop and smell the proverbial roses.\nYou know the bar down the street don’t close for an hour\nWe should take a walk and look at all the flowers\n“Slow Burn” is about more than Musgraves realizing she enjoys life more when she slows down. The chorus reveals another aspect of this preference when she sings, I’m gonna do it my way, it’ll be alright / If we burn it down and it takes all night / It’s a slow burn. When Musgraves wants to live life at a slower pace, she has to assert herself and do it her way. This is her way of acknowledging that taking things slow isn’t just something she enjoys—it’s something that requires her to make a conscious decision to reject the fast pace encouraged by our society.\nAbout Musgraves’ Co-Songwriters\nDaniel Tashian is the lead vocalist and guitarist for the Nashville-based band The Silver Seas. He has written or co-written songs for numerous other artists in addition to Musgraves, including Demi Lovato, Tim McGraw, Lee Ann Womack, Jessie James Decker, and Josh Turner. He also produced Decker’s On This Holiday album, among other recordings.\n[[RELATED: All the Songs on Kacey Musgraves’ Magical ‘Golden Hour’ Ranked]]https://americansongwriter.com/all-the-songs-on-kacey-musgraves-magical-golden-hour-ranked/\nIan Fitchuk is a producer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist who has also co-written songs for Maren Morris, Amy Grant and Pink. He has also played on albums from Harry Styles, Shania Twain and Miranda Lambert. In addition to co-producing Golden Hour with Musgraves and Tashian and co-writing seven of the album’s 13 tracks, Fitchuk co-produced and co-wrote songs with Musgraves (as did Tashian) for her 2021 album, Star-Crossed.\nImpact\n“Slow Burn” peaked at No. 38 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart, and it was certified Platinum. It is Musgraves’ third most-streamed song as a solo artist on Spotify, having received more than 140 million plays on the platform. Golden Hour went to No. 1 on Billboard’s Country and Folk charts and No. 4 on the Billboard 200, and it won Album of the Year and Best Country Album at the 2019 Grammy Awards.\nMusgraves partnered with candlemaker Boy Smells to create a scented candle called “Slow Burn.” When the product launched in 2020, it initially sold out in a matter of hours and was eventually carried by the Nordstrom department store chain.\n“Slow Burn” didn’t have the same crossover appeal as Golden Hour’s closer, “Rainbow,” which reached Billboard’s Adult Contemporary and Hot 100 charts, but the two songs together create a pair of beautiful bookends for the album. Thanks to Musgraves’ thoughtful and clever lyrics and the song’s dazzling production, none of her songs (so far) holds a candle to the brilliance of “Slow Burn.”\nPhoto by Erika Goldring/Getty Images for Americana Music Association",

    "text": "This post was originally published on here\nBy Jena Carr\nA selection of short films from young filmmakers will be on display in the lead-up to the North Bellarine Film Festival (NBFF) later this year.\nThe free screening event of the festival’s previous films will be held at Boronggook Drysdale Library from 5.30pm on Wednesday, July 30, before the NBFF’s return in November.\nVice president Robert Walton said the screening event would feature a mixture of films from young filmmakers in different genres, including animated, comedy, drama, and documentary films.\n“Filmmaking is a really tough gig. You obviously go to university and, when you leave, there’s not really any jobs being advertised,” he said.\n“Many of these people are really independent, which is a passion. They have that creative thing inside them that makes them go on to be successful.\n“We’ve put together a collection of films which date back to 2020 and they were all finalists of the Emerging Filmmaker Award and Emerging Documentary Filmmaker Award.”\nThe event will feature a documentary titled Sink or Swim by filmmaker Brie Bartleet, which follows the story of Bree-Arne Manley, a Point Lonsdale resident with multiple sclerosis who continues to surf and make music.\n“I’ve done a couple other projects post this one and I just want to keep telling stories and shining light on incredible stories,” Ms Bartleet said.\n“I’ve got a disabled brother and I’m also a surfer, so meeting Bree and getting to shine a light on disability awareness while making a film around surfing was a dream project.”\nVisit trybooking.com/CZOAR for tickets and more information about the free film screening event.",

But the team did an amazing job,\" No Limit skipper David Gotze said after his seventh-place finish across the line.\n\"We did the best with what we could do in the circumstances.\"\nThe retirement tally stands at 16 from 103 starters following a stormy Boxing Day night at sea.\nA strong wind warning is in place for waters off Tasmania's east coast, where a chunk of the fleet is tracking south.\nCruising Yacht Club of Australia commodore Arthur Lane said winds of 35 knots and 4.5-metre seas were expected on Friday afternoon and night.\n\"It is certainly slower than the last few years and that is because of the wind. It is an uphill race,\" he told AAP.\n\"It's going to be a very uncomfortable night.\"\nNSW entrant Salt Lines, veteran of 22 Sydney to Hobart races, and 52-footer Gunshot pulled the pin on Thursday night because of damage to their sails.\nRobbie Fisher, skipper of 66-footer Helsal 3, reported a broken mainsail rope, torn sail and \"other little things\".\n\"We have a minor injury to a crew ... our navigator was on deck, slipped, and cracked a couple of ribs,\" he said.\n\"We copped a beating across (Bass) Strait. We had over 30 knots and it was pretty bad. We have persevered though.\"\nHong Kong entrant Antipodes, crewed by Lindsay May in his 50th race, was slated to finish at some point on Friday.\n\"We've had some down time ... with breeze holes that our competitors didn't get,\" crew member Brad Kellett said.\n\"We've got a tear in the new mainsail to repair. We blew out our J2 headsail.\"\nThe Darren Hine-skippered Alive, overall winner in 2018, finished as clubhouse leader on handicap time.\nThe overall winner, which is awarded the Tattersall Cup, is judged on handicap which takes into account factors including the size of the boat.\nLawConnect won line honours on Thursday morning, coming from behind to beat fellow 100-footer and 2022 winner Andoo Comanche by just 51 seconds in the second-closest finish in Sydney to Hobart history.\n ",

    "text": "For the past few years, the tech world has been caught up in the frenzy of what’s often called the 'AI arms race' —a non-stop push to build the most powerful artificial intelligence systems, capable of surpassing human intelligence, transforming everything from healthcare to entertainment. Each breakthrough has been met with excitement, from the launch of GPT-3.5 to the first truly multimodal models like GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini. With every step forward, companies have bet big on a future where artificial general intelligence (AGI) is just around the corner. But lately, the race to build smarter AI seems to have kind of plateaued! AI giants—OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic—are realising that bigger models, more data, and faster computing power aren’t delivering the results they expected. In fact, some of their latest models are falling short of expectations, raising questions about the future of AI development and achieving AGI. Yann LeCun, AI pioneer and senior researcher at Meta, recently went to the extent of calling AI a dumber than a cat. &quot;Today’s models are really just predicting the next word in a text. But they’re so good at this that they fool us. And because of their enormous memory capacity, they can seem to be reasoning when, in fact, they’re merely regurgitating information they’ve already been trained on,&quot; LeCun told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview. Also read | AI pioneer Yann LeCun: India must embrace open source, invest in research to become an AI hub like France Is bigger always better? For years, the AI industry has followed the so-called &quot;scaling laws&quot; which suggest that increasing the size of models (in terms of computing power, data, and parameters) will lead to more powerful AI systems. Let’s make it simpler. Imagine you're baking a cake. You know that the bigger the cake, the more ingredients and oven time you'll need. AI scaling laws are similar, but instead of a cake, we're talking about AI models. These laws tell us that bigger AI models, trained on more data, generally perform better. It's like saying that a larger cake, baked longer, will taste better. However, there's a limit to this. Just like you can't keep making a cake infinitely bigger, there's a point where increasing an AI model's size and training data won't significantly improve its performance. OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who now runs his own AI lab, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), claims that the ChatGPT-maker’s recent tests trying to scale up its models suggest that those efforts have plateaued. &quot;The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again,&quot; Sutskever, who quit OpenAI in May last year, told Reuters in an interview. &quot;Everyone is looking for the next thing.&quot; OpenAI’s Orion model, for instance, reportedly faced issues in performing coding tasks due to insufficient training data in the domain. While improvements have been made through a post-training process, Orion is still not ready for public release, with OpenAI reportedly set to delay its rollout until early next year. According to a report in The Information, although OpenAI has completed only 20 percent of Orion’s training, it is already on a par with GPT-4 in intelligence, task fulfillment, and question-answering abilities. While Orion outperforms previous models, the quality improvement is less dramatic than the leap from GPT-3 to GPT-4. Similarly, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Opus has not significantly outperformed earlier models, despite being larger and more resource-intensive. &quot;Is there a plateau? Well, the facts are obvious, we have not seen a GPT-4 kind of release, we have seen other models catch up like Claude 3.5, but we have really not seen a significant leap of progress that we have to assume the labs are trying with bigger parameters, more data, more computing,” Tanuj Bhojwani, head of People + AI, said. “We have to assume that they have been trying the same strategy that they have been trying all the way up to GPT-4 and 4o, and if those strategies would have yielded results, we would have seen it by now, and that seems to be the reason for the slowdown,&quot; Bhojwani said. Ganesh Gopalan, co-founder and CEO of Gnani.ai, a Bengaluru-based AI startup, sees a shift in focus towards small language models as a way to solve real business problems. &quot;I think what we're actually observing is the focus shifting towards Small Language Models (SLMs) for solving real business problems. While large language models have been groundbreaking, SLMs offer some compelling advantages, especially when it comes to efficiency, accuracy and low latency,&quot; said Ganesh Gopalan. The data dilemma A key issue with training AI models is the availability of high-quality, human-made data. While AI companies have relied on scraping publicly available data from the internet, this approach is starting to hit limits. To train models that can handle complex, specialised tasks, companies need access to high-quality datasets, which are harder and more expensive to acquire. In response, companies like OpenAI have started to form partnerships with publishers and other organisations to get more targeted and diverse datasets. This approach is time-consuming and costly. Moreover, there's the growing problem of synthetic data. While computer-generated content (like text or images) is useful, it doesn’t always have the the richness or unpredictability of human-created material. &quot;Access to unique, human-generated data is paramount in the pursuit of human-like intelligence in AI. Think of it this way: the human brain learns from a lifetime of diverse, nuanced experiences. High-quality data leads to more accurate, reliable models that are less prone to hallucinations. Synthetic data does have a role, but we cannot discount the value of human-generated data,&quot; said Gnani.ai’s Gopalan. The cost With the rising cost of AI research and development, the stakes are getting higher. To develop cutting-edge models like GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini, companies have to spend tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. And as the models grow larger, so too do the costs. The cost of training a cutting-edge AI model today is estimated to be around $100 million, with that figure expected to balloon into the billions in the future. Bhojwani argues that the real challenge is not about scaling these models. &quot;There's no company which wins a billion dollars for having the biggest models. Companies win when their models are being used in real-life applications and they're getting paid, and they continue to have money and free cash flow to invest, and keep pushing the technology boundary because customers will always be demanding of the best.&quot; Bhojwani believes that once companies realise that scaling alone isn't a sustainable strategy, they can leverage their existing resources to concentrate on practical use cases. &quot;So it's just a question of when do you give up on that scaling ambition which is FOMO-driven. If OpenAI is investing $10 billion, then Anthropic wants to invest that much, and somebody else wants to invest similar amounts,&quot; Bhojwani said. Earlier in November, OpenAI chief Sam Altman in a Reddit post said that the company will prioritise shipping o1 and its successors. “All of these models have gotten quite complex and we can't ship as many things in parallel as we'd like to. (we also face a lot of limitations and hard decisions about we allocated our compute towards many great ideas),” he said. Shifting focus? While traditional scaling laws focus on pre-training larger models, companies like OpenAI are adopting new ways to scale models, by focusing on training time and inference time. Training time refers to the amount of time it takes to train a model on a dataset. Inference time refers to the amount of time it takes for a model to process a query and generate a response. The o1 model that OpenAI recently previewed, spends extra time computing an answer before responding to a query. “With o1, we developed one way to scale test-time compute, but it isn't the only way and might not be the best way. I'm excited to see academic researchers explore new approaches in this direction,&quot; OpenAI research scientist Noam Brown said in a post on X. OpenAI has also been shifting its focus away from simply building larger models to creating new use cases for existing models, such as developing AI “agents”. &quot;We will have better and better models, but I think the thing that will feel like the next giant breakthrough will be agents,&quot; Altman said in a Reddit post. Even other players such as Meta and Google DeepMind are reportedly trying similar methods.\",",
