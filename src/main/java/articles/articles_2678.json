    "text": "Dahryn Trivedi is a revolutionary leader and Enlightened Master from Divine Connection International, a non-profit organization at the intersection of science, consciousness, and human potential.\nDahryn Trivedi recently appeared on On Fire for Life , the popular podcast hosted by Temple Hayes, where she discussed the intersection of science and spirituality.\nA Transformative Conversation with Temple Hayes\nDuring the episode, Dahryn spoke about how Divine Energy is reshaping our understanding of well-being. She highlighted the importance of higher consciousness in solving today’s global challenges, from health crises to agricultural sustainability, and explained how her research is paving the way for a new era in scientific and spiritual collaboration.\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKtBIgudui8\nBridging Science and Spirituality\nDahryn Trivedi’s presence is both luminous and deeply grounding. When she speaks about Divine Energy, her voice carries a certainty that comes not from mere belief but from years of experience and scientific validation. She is not just a spiritual leader—she is part of a groundbreaking movement working to prove the measurable effects of Divine Energy through rigorous research and clinical trials.\nAs an Enlightened Spiritual Master, Dahryn has devoted her life to understanding and validating how Divine Energy can transform human consciousness, well-being, and even physical matter.\nHer Guru and husband, Guruji Mahendra Trivedi marked a transformative moment in her life, inspiring her to embark on a mission to help scientifically validate Divine Energy and its impact on human consciousness and well-being. Their groundbreaking research in scientifically validating Divine Energy has led to more than 6,000 experiments and more than 670 peer-reviewed publications with over 12,000 citations indexed in over 2,500 universities across the globe, including Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Oxford, and Cambridge—demonstrating profound, measurable effects on human health, agriculture, non-living materials at the atomic level, etc.\nFor centuries, the realms of spirituality and science have existed separately. Dahryn’s work seeks to bridge these two worlds, demonstrating that Divine Energy is not just a philosophical concept but a force that can be measured and validated through rigorous scientific methods.\n“People often ask if Divine Energy is real,” says Dahryn. “The answer is simple: Science proves it. We are no longer discussing abstract ideas—we have data, clinical trials, and measurable transformations.”\nHer recent research includes a six-month clinical trial conducted in collaboration with a leading multinational Contract Research Organization (CRO) using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox. This study examined the impact of her Divine Blessings on over 100 participants. The results were profound, with scientists noting significant improvements in cognition, motor function, and psychological well-being.\nA New Paradigm for Well-Being\nDahryn challenges conventional notions of health and wellness. “Well-being isn’t just about the absence of disease,” she explains. “True health means waking up with joy, motivation, and purpose. It means having the energy to pursue your passions, the mental clarity to make sound decisions, and the emotional resilience to navigate life’s challenges.”\nBillions of people worldwide struggle with feelings of emptiness, exhaustion, and lack of purpose, despite following every modern health trend. Dahryn asserts that the missing link is Divine Grace. “All the self-help techniques, fitness regimens, and diets in the world can’t replace the power of Divine Energy,” she states. “Divine Blessings can uplift a person’s consciousness, bringing lasting inspiration, motivation, and enthusiasm.”\nTransforming Lives Through Divine Blessings\nDahryn’s work has touched countless lives. Those who have received her Divine Blessings report remarkable transformations—improved mental clarity, heightened creativity, deeper emotional resilience, and even physical improvement.\nThe Future of Consciousness Research\nAs the world continues to explore the intersections of spirituality and science, Dahryn’s work is opening new doors. “This is just the beginning,” she says. “We are entering an era where consciousness will be recognized as the most powerful force in the universe. The more we understand it, the more we can harness it to transform lives.”\nFor those interested in learning more, Dahryn encourages individuals to explore the research and experience the energy firsthand. “You don’t have to take my word for it,” she smiles. “The best way to understand Divine Energy is to feel it for yourself.”\nAbout Dahryn Trivedi\nDahryn Trivedi is a revolutionary leader and Enlightened Master from Divine Connection International, a non-profit organization at the intersection of science, consciousness, and human potential.

    "text": "Os auditores fiscais federais brasileiros iniciaram uma greve nacional por causa de salários, de acordo com uma postagem no site do sindicato, avisando que a ação iniciada na terça-feira (26) duraria indefinidamente e incluiria um protesto em Brasília na próxima semana.\nA mobilização, que preocupa comerciantes de commodities agrícolas, importadores de bens de capital e agências de navegação, pode afetar a movimentação de cargas em portos como o de Santos, o maior da América Latina.\nOs auditores trabalham na alfândega, inspecionando cargas e também determinando impostos sobre importações e exportações.\n“A greve ocorre em um momento em que o país enfrenta vários problemas logísticos e pode comprometer ainda mais o comércio exterior brasileiro”, disse o escritório de advocacia Martinelli Advogados, de Santa Catarina.\n“É inaceitável que os Auditores-Fiscais não tenham reajustado o seu vencimento básico, que acumula perdas inflacionárias desde 2016. Da mesma maneira, não aceitaremos tratamento não isonômico em relação a outras categorias”, disse o presidente do Sindifisco Nacional, Auditor-Fiscal Isac Falcão. “O governo tem uma obrigação a cumprir com os Auditores-Fiscais e está inadimplente. Vamos, mais uma vez, com a força da nossa categoria mobilizada, fazer valer nossos direitos.”\nOs auditores da Receita Federal estão mobilizados desde julho, cobrando do governo a abertura da negociação do reajuste do vencimento básico. Em outubro, a mobilização escalou para paralisações de 24 horas e 48 horas. Em novembro, a categoria cumpre 48 horas de paralisação em todas as terças e quartas-feiras do mês.\n(com Reuters)",

The Howth woman has been relaxing up north with husband Spencer Matthews and their three kids Theodore, Gigi and Otto over Christmas and New Year. The family-of-five are currently staying on the Glen Affric Estate in Inverness-shire, Scotland, which is owned by Mathews’ family. The estate is located in the Scottish Highlands, surrounded by an epic mountain range and series of lakes. Vogue posted on Instagram: “I despise cold water and do not like being cold, I even think the sea in Spain in the summer is cold. Saying that I’ve been getting into this with @spencermatthews who sits in there like a duck happy as Larry. \"Some days I was AWFUL, today I managed a minute, it definitely makes you feel so good!” Vogue captioned her swim. Vogue previously wrote about how much she was looking forward to having some down time to relax. “We have been looking forward to this time away with our family for so long.
