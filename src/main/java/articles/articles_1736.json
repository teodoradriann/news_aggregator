    "text": "Cleveland Browns wider receiver Elijah Moore appeared to twitch involuntarily on the ground before being ruled out of Thursday night's NFL game against the Jets with concussion. Moore appeared to hit the ground face down after being tackled by Jets No 57 C. J. Mosely with one minute and 44 seconds remaining in the second quarter of Thursday night's game. Moore had part of the turf from the field in his grill and as the camera filmed him lying on his back, his arms and hands seemed to scarily jolt up into the air. His worried teammates beckoned to the sidelines to get the trainers onto the field while Mosely appeared to carefully step up and around his opponent. The 23-year-old was later ruled out of the game with concussion. Really scary moment for Elijah Moore, who looks like he started seizing after the hit. Hope he is okay. pic.twitter.com/IOZ6apzwil Elijah Moore appeared to jolt involuntarily after being tackled face-down to the ground Moore was tackled to the ground by Jets linebacker C.J. Mosely during Thursday's game Moore's teammates stand around him as he is treated on the field in concerning scenes The incident sparked a number of concerned responses from doctors who were watching the game. Dr Evan Jefferies, a California-based doctor of physical therapy, wrote on X: 'Unfortunately those are involuntary movements from a brain Injury for Elijah Moore.' Jeff Mueller, another physical therapy doctor, wrote: 'Involuntary limb movement occurs when there’s disruption between the brain and the muscles. 'Every concussion is different but could be a multi-week absence for Moore.' A lengthy absence for Moore would be a major blow for him and his team with the playoffs on the horizon. The 37-20 victory for the Browns on Thursday clinched a place in the playoffs. The team has 10 days before its last game of the regular season, on the road to Cincinnati Bengals. The Wild Card round of the playoffs begins on January 13.",

    "text": "It was almost a moment made for a movie.\nThe\nNBA’s worst team, losers of 27 straight games, takes on the NBA’s best team on its home court, a place it hasn’t lost all season, and slays the dragon, both figuratively and literally.\nIt would have been an inspirational movie for the ages.\nInstead,\nDetroit, the NBA’s worst team, found itself in another horror film, but this one had a sick, sick twist.\nGO DEEPER\nHow the Pistons, one of the NBA's most storied franchises, cratered\nThe Pistons fell to the\nCeltics on Thursday night, 128-122, in overtime after leading by 19 points at halftime. The franchise is now tied for the longest losing streak in NBA history (over two seasons) at 28. Detroit didn’t do anything particularly different through the first 24 minutes. Cade Cunningham made shots like he has been, the defense was OK and the Pistons still turned the ball over way too much. Boston, though, shot a horrid 39 percent from the field and 17 percent from 3 while turning the ball over 10 times. It was the first time in a long time that it felt like an opposing team shot poorly against Detroit.\nAdvertisement\nOnce the Celtics tied the game to end the third quarter, it was a back-and-forth battle the rest of the way. The Pistons briefly trailed by six points late in the fourth quarter but showed some poise late in the game to not crumble in crunch time like thy have most of the season.\nDetroit had several opportunities to take a lead with seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, but veterans\nBojan Bogdanovic and Alec Burks — both of whom shoot better than 38 percent from 3 for their careers — missed multiple wide-open looks.\nGO DEEPER\nWhere does Pistons’ losing streak rank in sports history?\nThe Celtics had a two-point lead with 4.8 seconds left when Bogdanovic cleaned up a Cunningham missed 3-point attempt. Tatum missed a shot at the end of regulation that led to overtime.\nIn the extra period, Boston looked like a team that has played in intense moments before, making shots and playing without mistakes. The Pistons shot under 40 percent from the field and were 1-for-6 from 3.\nDetroit will face the\nRaptors, at home, on Saturday to try and avoid loss No. 29.\nRequired reading\nPistons owner Tom Gores Q&A: On state of franchise, potential changes: ‘We have a problem’ Pistons trade scenarios: Examining what Detroit could do, what I’m hearing Want your NBA team to rebuild?

Ghandour led his wife Shahad by the hand towards the tent decorated with some coloured lights and a mirror with a gold-coloured frame as a few relatives escorted them, clapping in time. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 19-01-2024 21:50 IST | Created: 19-01-2024 21:50 IST Palestinian groom Mohammed al-Ghandour wanted to give his bride a beautiful wedding but after war began in Gaza they had to flee their homes and the couple finally got married this week in the tent city where they now live. Ghandour led his wife Shahad by the hand towards the tent decorated with some coloured lights and a mirror with a gold-coloured frame as a few relatives escorted them, clapping in time. Inside the tent Shahad, wearing a white dress and veil with traditional red embroidery, lifted her hand and Ghandour put a ring on it. \"I wanted a party. I wanted a celebration, a wedding. I wanted to invite my friends, my relatives and my cousins, like anyone would,\" said Ghandour. The couple are from Gaza City in the north of the tiny enclave where some of the worst of Israel's heavy bombardment and the fighting between it and Hamas have taken place since the war began on Oct. 7. The homes of both Ghandour's family and Shahad's family were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes, they said, and they lost cousins and other family members in the bombardment. \"My happiness is maybe at 3% but will get myself ready for my wife. I want to make her happy,\" said Ghandour. The war began when Hamas fighters rampaged into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 240 hostages. Israel's bombardment and assault into Gaza have killed more than 24,760 people according to health authorities there. Instead of the big party that Ghandour had wanted, he and Shahad had a small group of relatives who like them had managed to leave Gaza City and flee to Rafah, at the far southern end of the strip next to Egypt. Shahad's mother led a small group of women ululating in celebration of the marriage and somebody had saved batteries for a small portable music player. For a wedding feast in an enclave that the U.N. warns is heading towards famine, the couple had only a few snacks in plastic package, laid out carefully for them in the tent. Both families had already spent lots of money on the wedding before the war began. Shahad had spent more than $2,000 on clothes, they said. \"My dream was to give Shahad the best wedding, the most beautiful in the world,\" said her mother, Umm Yahia Khalifa. \"We prepared her wedding things and she was happy. But it is all gone in the shelling. Every time she remembers she starts to cry,\" she said. As the small wedding party began to clap and dance, people around them went about their daily chores among the lines of tents stretched across the sand, seeking food or hanging laundry. A small girl in a pink and white dress smiled broadly as the clapping began and joined a group of other children dancing as the sun set behind the high border fence topped with barbed wire.

    "text": "- Jack Hinshelwood (11')\n- João Pedro (23' Pen, 75' Pen)\n- Pervis Estupiñán (63')\n- Alejo Veliz (81')\n- Ben Davies (85')\nTottenham fall to Brighton as late rally comes up short\nHow Spurs found themselves in a 'ridiculous situation' vs. Brighton\nThe \"ESPN FC\" crew try to make sense of Tottenham's gung-ho approach to games after they were humbled 4-2 at Brighton.\nTottenham Hotspur's top-four ambitions suffered a blow as they lost 4-2 at Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Thursday with only a late rally saving them from their heaviest defeat since Ange Postecoglou became manager.\nVictory would have put injury-hit Spurs above\nManchester City into fourth spot but they were mauled on the south coast as a Brighton side also missing key players ran riot.\n-\nStream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nA powerful early strike by Josh Hinshelwood and Joao\nPedro's penalty gave the hosts a deserved 2-0 lead at half-time as Tottenham struggled to deal with Brighton's intensity.\nThe visitors responded in the second half with\nRicharlison having a goal disallowed but when halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan sent a thunderbolt past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario and Joao Pedro netted a second penalty the game seemed over.\nHowever, when Tottenham's late substitute\nAlejo Veliz fired home from close range in the 75th minute and Ben Davies scored with a header a miraculous comeback suddenly looked possible.\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the post for Spurs in stoppage time as Brighton looked nervy, but they held on to move into eighth place in the table on 30 points while Tottenham remain fifth on 36, a point off the top four.\nThe final scoreline hardly did justice to a chaotic match in which Tottenham were off the pace for long periods but showed admirable spirit to emerge with their pride intact.\nFor Brighton, without the likes of winger Kaoru Mitoma, Tariq Lamptey, Solly March and Julio Enciso, they snapped a three-match winless sequence.\nTottenham's defensive problems, made worse by centre-back Cristian Romero having been added to their injury list, were exposed by Brighton as the hosts dominated the first half.\nVicario had already made two saves before Hinshelwood was played in by Joao Pedro on the edge of the area and thumped an unstoppable shot high into the net.\nBrighton almost doubled their lead when Jan Paul van Hecke's header hit the post and as the ball rebounded towards Danny Welbeck the striker was pulled back by Dejan Kulusevski with a penalty being awarded after a VAR check.\nJoao Pedro rolled the 23rd-minute spot kick past Vicario to put Brighton in command, although Richarlison nearly responded just before half-time with a shot that kissed the post.\nSpurs looked brighter after the break and wasted several chances before Richarlison netted, only to have his joy cut short as VAR showed he was offside.\nEstupinan made it 3-0 to Brighton with a sensational strike from outside the area before Tottenham substitute Giovani Lo Celso conceded a penalty that was dispatched by Joao Pedro.\nA raft of substitutions revived Spurs with Bryan Gil and Veliz adding some energy to the visitors and the latter celebrated wildly as he slotted his first goal for the club.\nDavies headed in from close range and Tottenham then had numerous chances to try to grab an unlikely point.\nGame Information\n- Referees:\n- Jarred Gillett\nEnglish Premier League Standings\n|Team||GP||W||D||L||GD||P|\n[Arsenal](/football/club/_/id/359/arsenal) [Aston Villa](/football/club/_/id/362/aston-villa) (/football/club/_/id/382/manchester-city) (/football/club/_/id/367/tottenham-hotspur) [West Ham United](/football/club/_/id/371/west-ham-united) [Manchester United](/football/club/_/id/360/manchester-united) [Brighton & Hove Albion](/football/club/_/id/331/brighton-hove-albion) [Newcastle United](/football/club/_/id/361/newcastle-united) [Chelsea](/football/club/_/id/363/chelsea) [Wolverhampton Wanderers](/football/club/_/id/380/wolverhampton-wanderers) [AFC Bournemouth](/football/club/_/id/349/afc-bournemouth) [Fulham](/football/club/_/id/370/fulham) [Brentford](/football/club/_/id/337/brentford) [Crystal Palace](/football/club/_/id/384/crystal-palace) [Nottingham Forest](/football/club/_/id/393/nottingham-forest) [Everton](/football/club/_/id/368/everton) [Luton Town](/football/club/_/id/301/luton-town) [Burnley](/football/club/_/id/379/burnley) [Sheffield United](/football/club/_/id/398/sheffield-united)\nPremier League News\n[Shaka Hislop says Hugo Lloris is at the point in his career to join LAFC.](/video/clip/_/id/39200035)\nHislop: Lloris to LAFC makes a lot of sense\n[Goals from Tomas Soucek and Konstantinos Mavropanos guided West Ham United to a first win in eight years at the Emirates Stadium against Arsenal.](/video/clip/_/id/39200010)",
