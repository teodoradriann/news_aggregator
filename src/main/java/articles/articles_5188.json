    "text": "Mumbai: Religious minorities who had very little role to play in Bangladeshi politics or in the recent agitations against the Sheikh Hasina government are being attacked, said the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) which has asked the central government to provide shelter to members of religious minorities who may want to escape violence in that country.\n“Hindu homes, businesses, temples, and idols are being targeted. Even Hindu crematoriums are not being spared and there are attempts to grab Hindu properties as part of ‘land jihad’,” said Mohan Salekar, Konkan Prant Mantri of the VHP at a press conference held in Mumbai on Thursday.\nFPJ Shorts Mumbai: VHP Urges Indian Govt To Provide Shelter To Religious Minorities Fleeing Violence In Bangladesh Maharashtra: CM Eknath Shinde Orders Urgent Pothole Repairs On Key Highways, Implements Traffic Regulations For Ganesh Chaturthi India Faces Diplomatic Dilemma: Hosting Controversial Bangladeshi Leader Sheikh Hasina Amid Growing Tensions; VIDEO Bombay HC Emphasises Quality Control In DNA Testing; Orders Cross-Examination Of Forensic Experts In Death Penalty Case Salekar said that Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and other religious minorities in the country should be allowed to enter India. While the government should give shelter to Hindus who want refuge here, security on the 4,096-kilometer-long India-Bangladeshi border should be strengthened so that criminals do not sneak in.\n“We want a democratic government in Bangladesh which can protect human rights. We are with the Bangladeshi people, but there are groups taking advantage of the situation in that country to attack Hindus. We appeal to the Hindus to have patience,” said Salekar.\nSalekar questioned the silence of the opposition and human rights groups to the violence against Bangladeshi Hindus. “Contrast this to the hue and cry they raised in incidents like the one in Hathras. Not one so-called secular group has condemned the violence against Hindus in that country,” said Salekar.\nVHP spokesperson Shriraj Nair said that the Hindu population in Bangladesh has fallen from 32% at the time of its independence in 1971 to 8% now. “A protest by students against the government has turned into an attack against Hindus. They are taxpayers and have a low representation in crime, but whenever there is an event like this Hindus are targeted. ISKCON temples, the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre have been attacked. There has been violence against Hindu women, but human rights groups and feminist organisations in India have been quiet,” said Nair.\nRead Also Bangladesh Unrest: Ramkrishna Mission In Dhaka Appeals Indian Govt For Security Of Hindus <img data-src=\"https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-08-07/qlgahp8p/bangladesh-unrest.webp\" ?format=webp&w=768&dpr=1.3 \" src=\" images/FJP-default-16x9.png\" alt=\"article-image\"> Replying to questions from representatives of media groups about statements from Indian politicians about the possibility of something similar happening in India, Salekar said, “We have seen situations like this being created in India, like the Shaheen Baug protests and farmer’s agitation, but a situation like Bangladesh will not happen in India. This is because Hindus are a majority in this country.",

    "title": "US announces $325 million in funding to boost Puerto Rico solar projects as power outages persist",
    "text": "SAN JUAN – The U.S. government announced Thursday that $325 million in federal funds will be available for solar and battery storage installations across Puerto Rico as the U.S. territory struggles with chronic power outages . The program, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, will target community centers and healthcare facilities, as well as common areas in subsidized, multi-family housing. Recommended Videos “Households aren’t the only place you need power during and after an emergency,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm during a visit to Puerto Rico. The announcement comes amid widespread anger over outages that repeatedly leave Puerto Ricans in the dark. The island of 3.2 million people has a more than 40% poverty rate and some cannot afford a generator. Government officials say the outages also endanger the lives of those who depend on oxygen, refrigerated insulin and dialysis machines. Granholm on Thursday visited the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel, one of several towns in the area hit by a power outage in June that left 10,000 customers in the dark. That same month, another widespread outage left some 350,000 customers without power across Puerto Rico, prompting Gov. Pedro Pierluisi to order an investigation. “It is unacceptable,” Granholm said of the situation. The outage in Santa Isabel and nearby towns prompted Luma, a private company that operates the transmission and distribution of power, to install emergency generators. Luma also launched a $4-million effort to transport and install a new mega transformer in the area, but the plan failed after crews discovered that an “internal problem” rendered the equipment unusable, further enraging customers and government officials. Luma recently said it would relocate another transformer based in the southeast coastal town of Maunabo, but the announcement angered the local mayor, who blocked access to the equipment, saying his town depended on it. Luma has said that transformer is not essential to providing electricity to Maunabo. On Sunday, Luma warned that at least 11 transformers in electric substations across Puerto Rico are “vulnerable,” and if they were to fail, tens of thousands of customers would be left without power. Puerto Rico’s power grid remains frail nearly seven years after Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, leaving some without electricity for up to a year. While the storm razed the power grid, it had long been crumbling given a lack of investment and maintenance by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is s till trying to restructure more than $9 billion in debt . Prior to Maria, renewable energy generation in Puerto Rico was at 3%. It has since grown to 9% thanks to homes and businesses that have been able to afford to install rooftop solar and storage, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Amid the outages, Puerto Ricans have been hit with power bill increases that many have decried. Puerto Rico’s electricity rate is now 41% higher than the average U.S. rate. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Energy also announced an $861 million loan guarantee to help build two solar photovoltaic farms in the southern towns of Guayama and Salinas. The guarantee was offered to Clean Flexible Energy, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of AES Corporation and TotalEnergies Holdings USA, Inc. Prior to arriving in Puerto Rico, Granholm visited the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday, where officials announced $100 million in federal funds to help buy fuel storage facilities. The U.S. territory also has struggled with chronic power outages in recent years, with island-wide outages hitting St. John and St. Thomas the day Granholm visited. Nearly three months ago, Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. declared a state of emergency following ongoing blackouts on St. Croix. The U.S. Virgin Islands Water & Power Authority faces crumbling infrastructure, with various local agencies including the waste management authorities and entities such as hospitals owing more than $11 million in total accumulated debt.",

    "text": "Vagneur: A good friend fought like a Finn\nWord still travels fast in this little burg, no matter how big your plane is, and I can’t tell you how many people have posed the question: “Have you heard about Erik?” If you haven’t heard about Erik, Aspen ski legend and Powder 8 skiing champion (with intrepid partner Flint Smith) by now, you’ve likely been in a cave.\nMy good friend, Erik Peltonen, died a week ago this past Wednesday, following complications from a motorcycle accident in October. Most every day, I walk by his ski locker where we’d sometimes sit on the bench and have a short visit, usually about what we’d skied that day. A deep sense of loneliness would hit me this winter as I passed, knowing he was struggling to recover from serious injuries and hoping he would soon be back on his feet.\nIn one of our first conversations as fellow patrollers, getting to know each other, he said, “I’m Finnish. My given name is Erkki, although it’s Erik here in the U.S.” For ever after, in greeting, shaking that firm, muscular hand of his, I’d always call him Erkki.\nIt takes a while to put a good man down, especially a Finn, and as Erik wrote in a letter to the editor back in 2012: “The Finns have something they call sisu. It is a compound of bravado and bravery, of ferocity and tenacity, of the ability to keep fighting after most people would have quit, and to fight with the will to win. The Finns translate sisu as ‘the Finnish spirit,’ but it is a much more gutful word than that.” You fought like a Finn, Erkki – rest in peace.\nNew to the Aspen Mountain ski patrol back in the ’70s, Erik, a man I barely knew, took me under his wing to make sure I learned the mountain as well as anyone could from the patrol perspective, even though I knew quite a bit already. He got us special permission to do whatever we needed, and we skied through every heavy, soggy, early December snowstorm (And there were a few that year) with a smile, backs wet as much from ducking under branches heavy with the stuff as from the individual flakes falling from the sky. I’ll never forget him asking one particularly rough day, “You want to keep going?” in that deep voice of his, and the big laugh my answer in the affirmative brought forth.\nAfter I quit the normal workaday world back when and started skiing every day, he and I would sometimes make plans to meet up, especially on powder days. There were new areas that had been thinned, just barely, since I’d left the patrol, and he knew it all like the back of his hand. He truly enjoyed skiing the unusual, seldom found cuts and openings here and there that few others seemed to find or like.\nBack then, Erik tossed out the invitation to ski Highland Bowl, and it wasn’t long before he guided my first trip up there, something we continued on a regular basis. We’d hit the Bowl 2 or 3 times a week and, afterward, head for Aspen Mountain, lunch at Bonnie’s, and finish the day off there.\nA couple years later, our good friend Bob Snyder came along with us, and Erik loved taking us down the most brutal stuff he could find – legally, anyway. He knew Highlands at least as well as he knew Aspen Mountain, but then, he’d served on the Highlands ski patrol before he came over to the Big Mountain. He had his retirement party from the city on Highland Bowl, an event you didn’t want to miss for anything.\nHe caught me in the trees alongside Blondie’s one day and said, “Hey, you want to go ski some brush.” Down to earth about anything on the mountain, he meant Bonnie Bell, a favorite when we were on the patrol, not open very often. We skied it twice that day, and it’s still “brush” skiing to me. There were places he had names for, like Hidden Treasure, Smuggler’s Slip, Devil’s Cauldron, Sun Spot, #3 Cliff, things like that. He wasn’t the fastest, but he was incredibly stable, his form 100%, and he hardly ever stopped.\nHe wasn’t one to deal with “How’s Walsh’s?” or “Been down the Queen lately?” You might say, in a literary way, that he didn’t suffer fools.\n“You can’t believe what you hear”, and his main philosophy about how anything skied was, “If you don’t go, you won’t know.”\nYou can’t trust what people say; find out for yourself. That became my philosophy, as well.\nErik, you were a helluva skier, but more than that, you were a hell of a good friend. You’re gonna be missed.\nTony Vagneur writes here on Saturday and welcomes your comments at .\nTony Vagneur writes here on Saturdays and welcomes your comments at ajv@sopris.net.\nSee more",

    "title": "Heart attack deaths happen most often in the last week of December, says the American Heart Association | wbir.com",
    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — [According to the American Heart Association](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-attack-deaths-spike-during-the-winter-holidays), heart attack deaths are more likely to happen during this time of year. \"During the Christmas holidays, and specifically the last week in December, we're seeing an increased correlation of heart attacks and strokes,\" said Dr. Emmanuel Isang, a UT Medical Center cardiologist. \"There's no true study that shows what exactly causes it. But we believe there are several factors that are associated with it.\" He said medical professionals believe this increase in heart attack deaths can be caused by stress, a change in routine and not eating or drinking in moderation. \"The first one is when we're with family and friends is an increase in stress,\" said Dr. Isang. \"And with that stress, we're not eating the right foods, we're eating more processed foods, drinking more alcohol and not exercising enough, which can, which are all risk factors for heart disease.\" With the rise in heart attack deaths this time of year, Isang says it's important to know the symptoms to look out for. \"Crushing chest pain, sometimes it can radiate to the left shoulder,\" said Isang. But he says the signs of a heart attack can be different, especially for women. \"Anyone who's having jaw pain, shortness of breath, shoulder pain, abdominal pain should also be included in that,\" he said. And for Robin Morgan, a heart attack survivor, she said it seemed like she just had the flu. \"The trigger for me was my arms, my forearms started hurting,\" said Morgan, \"And it felt like someone was ringing them. So that was kind of a trigger for me to go, that doesn't usually come along with flu symptoms, like you know, you get a fever. I did sweat a little bit. And I did find that I had some jaw pain.\" Morgan said if she didn't have those other symptoms, she probably would have just taken some medicine and ignored the pain. But she said she's thankful she did go to the emergency room, because she had a heart attack while in the cath lab. \"When I got there, my cardiologist, Janet Eichholz, was there and she did a nuclear stress test that day. I failed it miserably,\" said Morgan. \"And then we went to the cath lab, and she put a stent in my artery. It was 99% blocked.\" Morgan said before her heart attack, she wasn't exercising regularly or eating well — but now she has made lifestyle changes and she wants other people to consider making changes too. The American Heart Association's research shows that a third of the adults in Knox County are obese, have high blood pressure, or have high cholesterol, which can all put someone at a greater risk of having a cardiac event. \"Some of the biggest risk factors for heart disease include high cholesterol, diabetes, strong family history, when we're having family around, this is the perfect time to ask those appropriate questions,\" said Isang. \" But age is also a risk factor, high blood pressure. And also, potential unknown congenital conditions can play a huge factor. I think one of the biggest and the most preventable risk factors is smoking. So it's the best time to quit smoking. If not quitting, then reducing the amount of tobacco use.\" There are things you can do to lower your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. \"AHA recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity,\" he said. \"But more specifically, just being as consistent as possible and not trying to fall away from your routines exercise regularly. Watch what you're eating. Have fun, but like, everything in moderation.\" \"Just slow down, go look at the Christmas lights, go walk in the the park and just take in the beauty of what is out here for us,\" said Morgan.",
