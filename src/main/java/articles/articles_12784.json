    "text": "A principios de este año, Microsoft despidió a un aproximado de mil 900 empleados de Xbox, Activision Blizzard y Bethesda. Desafortunadamente, la división de videojuegos sufrió otra oleada de despidos.Según se informa, Phil Spencer, el CEO de Microsoft Gaming, envió un correo a los trabajadores afectados para anunciarles la noticia de su despido. Y en esta ocasión fueron 650 empleados de Xbox, lo que afectó de nuevo a Activision Blizzard y otras áreas de la compañía.El CEO de Microsoft Gaming publicó un comunicado en el que lamentaba la terrible noticia y tranquilizó a los jugadores que estaban preocupados por el posible cierre de estudios o la cancelación de proyectos. Ya que afirmó que eso no sucederá debido a que los despidos fueron en áreas corporativas y de apoyo.En dicho comunicado, Phil Spencer anunció que la oleada de despidos está relacionada con las recientes adquisiciones de Xbox y Microsoft. Como parte de una reorganización, las empresas eliminaron 650 puestos de Microsoft Gaming y que tomar esa decisión fue muy difícil, pero que es importante para el éxito de su negocio a largo plazo.Cabe destacar que en octubre del año pasado, Microsoft adquirió Activision Blizzard por 68 mil 700 millones de dólares después de haber sido acusado de querer convertirse en un monopolista en el mundo de los videojuegos.Además, Phil Spencer menciona que está profundamente agradecido por las contribuciones de los trabajadores que se han visto afectados. Sin embargo, tanto Xbox como Microsoft se comprometieron a indemnizar a las personas que fueron afectadas. Se les dará una indemnización por despido, servicios para ayudarles a encontrar un nuevo trabajo y asistencia médica.Asimismo, se confirmó que también habrá despidos de personal en otras áreas, pero no se cancelarán videojuegos, experiencias ni cierres de compañías. También menciona que habrá algunos impactos en otros equipos a medida que se adaptan a las prioridades cambiantes y administran el ciclo de vida y el rendimiento de los juegos. GG",

    "text": "Watch: Shreyas Iyer falls prey to bouncer again, short-ball nightmare haunts him in Buchi Babu tournament\nPublished - 30 Aug 2024, 04:36 PM | Updated - 30 Aug 2024, 04:37 PM\nTable of Contents\nIndia National Cricket Team batter Shreyas Iyer came under the scanner for his poor batting in the ongoing game against Tamil Nadu Cricket Association XI in the Buchi Babu tournament. The match between the two teams is being played at the Sri Ramakrishna College Cricket Ground.\nShreyas Iyer, who is representing Mumbai in the Buchi Babu tournament, didn't have a great outing in the game against Tamil Nadu. The middle-order batter struggled to get going in the first innings and then came under scanner for his dismissal in the second innings.\nIyer got out to short-ball yet again as his woes continued. The batter perished to a bouncer in the second innings as the bowler used his weakness against him. He attempted to play the pull shot but was caught inside the circle. Iyer managed just 22 runs as Mumbai came under pressure.\nShreyas Iyer perishes to short-ball against Tamil Nadu Cricket Association XI in the Buchi Babu tournament\nHere's the video:\nShreyas Iyer once again fall into trap of shot ball and it wasn't even a pacy delivery.— Raazi (@Crick_logist)\nAnd people want him as first retention for KKR.\nLol\n[pic.twitter.com/p6Ji6m4J0j] [August 30, 2024]\nIyer has failed to get going against the short ball irrespective of the format. The right-hander often has got out similarly. He has also been criticized a lot for not tackling the short ball well and it was one of the main reasons behind his downfall in the Indian National Cricket Team.\nThe ongoing Buchi Babu tournament will be extremely important for Shreyas Iyer as he eyes a comeback in the Indian Test team. Iyer was one of the backbones for the side in the longest format of the game as he replaced Ajinkya Rahane in the team and set the stage on fire.\nShreyas Iyer made an immediate impact in\nTest cricket as he slammed a century on debut. However, after that, he played quite a few impactful innings for the team and bailed them out of trouble. He couldn't maintain the consistency and was dropped from the team.\nIyer dropped from the team after the two Tests against England, having bagged a series of low scores in the last few games and his poor record in overseas games. He got dropped after returning with scores of 35, 13, 27, and 29 in the first two Tests against England National Cricket Team.\nOverall, Iyer has slammed 811 runs in 14 Tests at an average of 38.86, including one century and five 50s. The poor outing in the game against the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association XI wouldn't have done any good to him as he has been fighting back for the Test spot.\nIyer would be keen to make a huge impact in the Duleep Trophy 2024 now. He has been named in the Team D squad and will also be captaining the team in the tournament. Iyer would want to set the stage on fire take his team to the win and stage a comeback in the Test team.\nTagged:\nShreyas IyerBuchi Babu Tournament",

    "title": "Some Coral Species More Resilient To Climate Due To ‘Remembering’ How To Survive Former Heat Waves",
    "text": "In a groundbreaking revelation, recent research from scientists at\nOregon State University has uncovered the remarkable resilience of certain coral species to marine heat waves through a process akin to “remembering” previous survival experiences.\nThe study,\npublished in Global Change Biology, not only sheds light on the adaptability of corals but also indicates a strong correlation between this ecological memory response and the microbial communities residing within the coral structures.\nThe significance of this research is highlighted by the pivotal role coral reefs play in the world’s oceans. Although they cover less than one percent of the ocean’s expanse, coral reefs house nearly a quarter of all known marine species.\nBeyond their biodiversity, these reefs contribute significantly to regulating the levels of carbon dioxide in the sea and serve as a crucial resource for scientists exploring potential new medicines.\nStudy author and graduate student, Alex Vompe, said, “Slowing down the rate of coral cover and species loss is a major conservation goal. Predicting and engineering heat tolerance are two important tools.”\n“It is vital to understand how quickly reefs can adapt to ever more frequent, repeated disturbances such as marine heatwaves,” Vompe adds.\nThe study delves into the role of coral microbiomes, which constitute the diverse community of bacteria and archaea inhabiting coral reefs, as a potential key to rapid adaptation in the face of environmental stressors, particularly marine heat waves.\nVompe explained, “Climate change is threatening coral reefs in part because some of the relationships between coral and their microbes can be stressed by warming oceans to the point of dissolution.”\n“But Acropora retusa, a prevalent coral species in the Mo’orean coral reef that we studied, appears to have a powerful ecological memory response to heat waves that the microbiome seems to play a role in. This means some coral species may be more resilient to climate change than previously thought,” he adds.\nThe research was conducted over five years, focusing on 200 coral colonies at a reef situated on the north shore of Mo’orea in French Polynesia. The unique history of this reef, marked by a substantial disruption in 2010 caused by crown-of-thorns starfish and a cyclone, offered an unprecedented opportunity to examine the coral’s response to subsequent heat waves.\nThe catastrophic events of 2010 resulted in the destruction of over 99% of the coral colonies, effectively initiating a reset for the reef ecosystem. Corals began the process of reestablishment, facing comparatively minor heat wave events in 2016 and 2017.\nHowever, the most severe marine heat wave in the recorded history of the area occurred between December 2018 and July 2019, followed closely by the second-most severe heat wave in 2020.\n“We observed that some species of coral seem to remember exposure to past marine heat waves and maintain a higher level of health in subsequent heat waves. And Acropora retusa’s memory response was strongly linked to changes in its microbiome, supporting the idea that the microbial community has a part in this process,”\n said OSU Professor Vega Thurber.\nInterestingly, the cauliflower corals within the\nPocillopora genus exhibited a remarkable ability to withstand and recover from the heat events. Not only did these corals maintain good health throughout the challenging conditions, but their microbiomes also demonstrated an ecological memory response.\nDespite the initial disturbance caused by the 2019 heat wave, the cauliflower corals recovered to their pre-disturbance state, displaying resilience even in the face of the subsequent heat wave in 2020.\n“Members of coral microbial communities have unique biological features that make them more adaptable and responsive to environmental change – short generation cycles, large population sizes and diverse metabolic potential,” Vega Thurber said.\n“In two of the three coral species we focused on, we identified initial microbiome resilience, host and microbiome acclimatization, or developed microbiome resistance to repeated heat stress. The latter two patterns are consistent with the concept of ecological memory.”\nWhat are your thoughts? Please comment below and share this news!\nTrue Activist / Report a typo",

    "text": "President Tinubu said partnership on local vaccine production has become necessary owing to the challenges faced by developing countries, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks. ”We have capable and talented people who can make the necessary contributions to the production of vaccines in Nigeria and the rest of Africa,’’ the president told the visiting CEO, who assumed office on 18 March and has embarked on visits to some African countries. The president assured GAVI CEO of Nigeria’s commitment to fulfilling its outstanding counterpart contributions for routine vaccines for the year 2023. | | He directed the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Ali Pate, to work with the Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance to ensure the release of necessary funds for vaccine procurement. ”We intend to contribute to the development of our healthcare programme, and we are committed to partnering with GAVI,” the president said. The president stated that his administration is focused on ensuring that no child is left behind when it comes to vaccination against preventable childhood diseases. ”GAVI’s commitment to humanity is recognised throughout the world. Thank you for the impactful commitment to humanity, and we welcome the collaboration to save our children from preventable diseases. ”We as a nation are committed to your values, and we believe that no child should be left unprotected,” he said. President Tinubu acknowledged the invaluable perspective shared by the GAVI CEO, who hails from a developing country, Pakistan, and emphasised the importance of leveraging her experience for the benefit of children’s health. Commending Ms Nishtar for her visit to Nigeria and support for the administration’s health-sector initiatives, the president pledged to prioritise investments in health sector renewal, noting the importance of coordination and collaboration among federal, state, and local governments. In her remarks, the GAVI CEO congratulated the Nigerian government on its innovative health-sector initiatives, including increasing budgetary allocations to health to 4.6 per cent and commitment to providing HPV vaccines for adolescent girls, among others. She expressed readiness to collaborate with the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to leverage policy instruments and technical expertise to advance health outcomes. Ms Nishtar announced GAVI’s commitment to providing $250 million grant support to Nigeria, as well as its dedication to addressing vaccine inequity in Africa through initiatives like the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator, which has earmarked $1 billion to support the sustainable growth of Africa’s manufacturing base for vaccine production.

It is a special country in the world and it is a very special country for us in GAVI. There is a dictum in GAVI that says, ‘there is no success for GAVI without success in Nigeria’,” she said. The GAVI CEO also informed the president that the GAVI Board will be meeting in the coming weeks to decide on policy decisions that will impact the way in which Nigeria receives support from the organisation, beyond 2028, and that her visit to the country was for discussions with Nigeria’s health managers.
