    "text": "Letter: Let’s give credit to the women who built hockey league Kori Beckman. Alicia Kelly. Those are the names of two women who have been an integral part of the Mountain Women’s Hockey League that you wrote about. Yet somehow, in an article about the women’s hockey league, Ryan Sederquist mentioned that former coaches Aaron Beckman and Mick Kelly are married to players — without mentioning either of their spouses by name. Both women have helped grow our league. Both women have been involved with this program for years. Both women are remarkable hockey players in their own rights. Both women have captained teams. Joetta Stocks is a former MWHL player who is married to Josh Stocks. Josh was mentioned in the article, but I had to do a little research to figure out to whom he is married. I don’t personally know Joetta because she was involved with the MWHL before my time, but I am grateful for her contribution to growing women’s hockey in our valley. This league was developed for women, by women and while I am thrilled that the Daily wrote an article highlighting the MWHL and what it means to its participants, all three of these women deserved to be mentioned by name in your article.

    "text": "Giving up alcohol can be a big step in anyone’s life and it’s a journey that will have its challenges but ultimately be incredibly fulfilling for most, helping get their life back on track and living a healthier and happier life.\nFor those who are navigating alcohol addiction especially there are lots of considerations available to you. One is often what you can drink as an alternative and the environments you surround yourself.\nDeciding whether to drink non-alcoholic beer or not is often a question people ask, providing an alternative to the hard stuff but still getting the same flavor. But is it a wise option? Here are five reasons it may not be…\nIt Can Trigger Cravings One of the key reasons you might not want to drink 0% beer as an alternative is because it could trigger cravings. For recovering alcoholics, the sensory cues of picking up a pint, tand he smell of the hops can all act as powerful triggers and lead to cravings for alcohol.\nIt’s sort of a reminder of past drinking habits and that can quickly escalate to a huge risk of relapse. Anyone in recovery ultimately needs to minimize the risk of triggers and boost their chances of sobriety. Non-alcoholic beer can blur those lines.\nNon-Alcoholic Beer Is Not Entirely Alcohol-Free You’ll find that while some non-alcoholic beers are completely free of alcohol, a large portion of non-alcoholic beers are 0.5% ABV, so there is still alcohol in them. While it’s significantly lower and not really a problem for those not in recovery, it can reawaken the physical and psychological dependence on the substance for those that are living with addiction .\nIt Undermines the Recovery Mindset Mindset is a really important mindset in resetting your life and moving into recovery from alcohol addiction. You need to adjust your lifestyle to prioritise health, self-awareness and accoutnability. By shifting your drinking to non-alcoholic drinks it can slightly conflict with such a change as it could be perceived as clinging on to old habits rather than embracing the new.\nIt can send mixed messages not only to yourself, but others in the recovery community and for clarity it can often be a better option to reduce the risks and avoid 0% beer. Most people find it much better for themselves to completely leave their old life behind and focus on the new them. It might not seem it, but it really can make all the difference.\nSocial Perception and Pressure When drinking non-alcoholic beer in social settings, others may not realise it’s alcohol-free. This can lead to assumptions that you’ve resumed drinking, potentially weakening the support you receive from friends, family, or recovery groups. It may also open the door to questions and pressure that could be uncomfortable or triggering.\nFurthermore, consuming a non-alcoholic beer in a social context might make it easier to justify drinking an alcoholic beverage later on, especially if you’re feeling stressed or tempted.\nIt Can Be a Slippery Slope For many recovering alcoholics, non-alcoholic beer represents a slippery slope back to regular drinking. What starts as an occasional indulgence could evolve into more frequent consumption, eventually leading to rationalisations for drinking alcoholic beverages again.\nRecovery is about building resilience and avoiding situations that could compromise progress. Non-alcoholic beer, despite its low alcohol content, can be a gateway to old behaviours and thought patterns that are difficult to break.\nOf course, some people in recovery find that non-alcoholic beer really does work for them, but it’s important to understand the risks and make a more informed decision as even though there’s no alcohol involved, it can trigger old habits and increase the risk of relapse significantly.",

    "title": "How Bills Mafia, Josh Allen and the Buffalo pass rush could be the difference in AFC Divisional game",
    "text": "Kansas City's trip to Highmark Stadium for their Divisional matchup against Buffalo will mark the first time that quarterback Patrick Mahomes will play on the road in front of an opposing fanbase. With a spot in the AFC Championship on the line, it is safe to assume that Bills Mafia will make their presence felt. \"For [Kansas City] to step into our home, it's going to be drastically different. Because we go into Arrowhead and the number one thing you guys ask are asking us is how are you going to handle the crowd noise?\" said left tackle Dion Dawkins. \"I'm very confident in the Mafia â€¦ I know that they're gonna bring it and I'm hoping that they bring it to the highest that they've ever brought it because I'm excited to see them.\" Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said that it would be important for Kansas City to roll with the punches early as the team has to get used to a hostile road playoff environment for the first time since 2015. \"You go into a setting like that, there is a little bit of 'let's make sure we survive what comes early and then thrive,'\" Spagnuolo said. \"We expect it to be a great atmosphere, that's what the Buffalo fans are like.\" A matchup for the ages While the matchups between the high-octane Buffalo offense and the sturdy Kansas City defense will certainly be interesting to watch, the biggest storyline from Sunday's game has to be the budding rivalry between Mahomes and quarterback Josh Allen. The two are tied at three wins apiece in their six games against each other, although Mahomes is 2-0 in the playoffs against Allen. The Bills quarterback, who led the NFL with 44 total touchdowns this season, has Spagnuolo's attention as he is tasked with the difficult task of stopping one of the most uniquely talented players in the NFL. \"Just about everything,\" Spagnuolo said on what stands out to him about Allen. \"The size, the arm, the mental aspect of it and then you add in his running ability. To me, when you put that tape on and he's running and the way he makes people miss at 6-foot-5, or whatever he is, to me is amazing. I don't know where you've ever seen that.\" Along with Allen, Spagnuolo and the Chiefs secondary will have to hone in on wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who has been one of the most productive receivers in the NFL since joining Buffalo. \"He's a great receiver, smart, great route-runner, hard-working and I think that's why he's been one of the top receivers in the league,\" said cornerback L'Jarius Sneed. Diggs had just 24 receiving yards in the Bills' 20-17 win over the Chiefs earlier this season, his lowest production of the season. Over the past two games, the nine-year veteran has totaled 139 yards and averaged nearly 10 yards per catch. Under pressure While the Bills left Kansas City with a win, they did so without defensive tackle DaQuan Jones, who was injured in Buffalo's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 5. Since Jones returned to the field against the New England Patriots in Week 17, the Bills are 3-0. Assistant head coach and defensive line coach Eric Washington said that adding Jones back to the mix makes it easier for all members of the defensive line. \"Last year when DaQuan was with us when we played in Kanas City, he did a really good job of winning his one-on-ones and taking the depth away from the pocket so now Ed Oliver has a chance to work,\" Washington said Thursday morning. \"DaQuan accumulates blocks by collapsing the pocket, now hopefully that gives Ed a little bit more room to work.\" By creating pressure from the front of the pocket, Buffalo hopes to create discomfort for Mahomes, who is one of the best quarterbacks in the league when facing pressure. \"Protection concepts would like to set the depth of the pocket. It gives the quarterback an opportunity to survey, go through his reads and progressions and then step up in the pocket if things start to extend and we have to make sure that we take that away from the opponent, not just this week but every week.\" Injury report Cornerback Christian Benford (knee), linebacker Terrel Bernard (ankle), wide receiver Gabe Davis (knee), wide receiver Stefon Diggs (foot/vet rest), safety Taylor Rapp (calf) and linebacker Baylon Spector (back) did not practice Thursday afternoon. Linebacker Tyrel Dodson (shoulder), cornerback Rasul Douglas (knee), nickel cornerback Taron Johnson (concussion) and punter Sam Martin (left hamstring) were limited. Quarterback Josh Allen (neck), edge Leonard Floyd (vet rest), safety Micah Hyde (neck) and edge Von Miller (vet rest) were full participants. Nice guy Mitch Morse is [well-regarded as an integral leader of the Buffalo Bills and overall nice individual](https://www.buffalobills.com/news/how-mitch-morse-s-dad-persona-helps-the-bills-through-thick-and-thin). The local Buffalo Bills beat writers clearly agree, as Morse won the second annual Kent Hall Stand Up Guy award from the Buffalo chapter of the Professional Football Writers of America for helping the media in a fair and respectful way. \"I don't envy y'all's job by any means,\" Morse said after being presented with the award. \"But over the years I've understood that it's not as easy as some deem it. ... It's been a privilege these last five years to be a part of not only this community but affiliated with you guys.\" Scroll to see photos from the Buffalo Bills Divisional Round practice as the team prepares to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.",

    "text": "The Department of Disabilities, along with its advisory council on autism, announced its strategy today to help Marylanders on the spectrum and their families. The committee was created by legislation put forth by state delegate Michele Guyton in 2020. It brought together stakeholders within the autism community to design a strategy focused on education, employment, housing, transportation, safety, and health. The secretary of the department of disabilities said their strategy will help people within a wide range of disability levels. \"Many families really struggle....They struggle with those challenges, and people with autism struggle with challenges. But we believe in a community approach and a collaborative approach to come around people and bring out the best in them.\" The state autism coordinator, Victoria Rodriguez-Roldan, walked the group through the strategy, which will be in place for five years before being reassessed. She also announced a state website will be launched Friday, putting state resources for families all in one place.",
