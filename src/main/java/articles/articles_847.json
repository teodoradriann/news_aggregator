Airlines have requested passengers to keep a check on the status of flights on airline websites before leaving for the airport. Passengers who arrived at the airport but were not aware of the delays were seen sitting on the floors and waiting for an update from the airline. \"I have been waiting for 12 hours at T-3 in the cold to catch a flight to Sharjah. The airline made no arrangements for passengers in case of delay in such weather,\" said Fakrool, a native of Rampur in UP. According to airport sources, visibility on Friday fell to 150 meters, which is considered moderate for flight operations. \"No diversions have been reported till 8 am on Friday. There were several delays due to the weather and other conditions,\" as per sources. \"I have a flight to Toronto, and it is delayed. I arrived at the airport in the morning from Punjab, and I am waiting for the update from the airline,\" said a passenger Kuldeep Singh, who was waiting with his family at IGI airport.

December 28, 2023 at 10:46 PM · 2 min read Link Copied Read full article\nDec. 28—CATLETTSBURG — A 39-year-old man pleaded guilty on Thursday to multiple charges after throwing the contents of his colostomy bag at hospital workers last summer.\nJoshua A. Potter, of an unknown address, was jailed following the incident at the King's Daughters emergency department in early July for reportedly attacking hospital workers with feces after ripping open his own colostomy bag, per previous reports.\nPotter was indicted shortly thereafter on charges of third-degree assault on medical personnel, third-degree criminal mischief, trespassing and public intoxication.\nOn Thursday, Potter appeared via video conference from the Boyd County Detention Center to enter a guilty plea alongside his attorney, Whitney Davis.\nBoyd Circuit Judge John Vincent said he was \"particularly interested\" in the details surrounding the third-degree assault charge before accepting the settled plea agreement between prosecutors and Davis.\n\"Well ...\" Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Kierston Rosen began before elaborating on the allegations against Potter.\nRosen said Potter attempted to throw \"fecal matter\" at hospital employees but added, \"thankfully,\" no worker was hit by Potter's colostomy contents.\nIn exchange for Potter's admissions to third-degree assault, public intoxication and third-degree criminal mischief, the Commonwealth proposed to dismiss his charge of trespassing.\nWith the narrowly missed victims' and law enforcement's approval, Vincent accepted the plea arrangement and sentenced Potter according to the Commonwealth's suggestion.\nPotter was sentenced to 90 days in jail for both public intoxication and criminal mischief (the maximum for both charges) and five years for third-degree assault on medical personnel.\nIn accordance with his plea arrangement, Potter will serve 180 days in jail and the remaining balance of the five-year sentence will be served under supervised probation.\nOne of the terms of his probation is to abide by Vincent's order to stay away from all KDMC properties, unless in a \"dire medical emergency.\"\nVincent said if Potter violates any probation condition or trespasses on KDMC property, his probation could be revoked — meaning the five-year sentence would be served behind bars.\n(606) 326-2652 —\nView comments",

    "text": "La ola de calor que durante los últimos días ha azotado a una gran parte del país ha remitido pero siete comunidades siguen hoy en alerta ante las elevadas temperaturas que se van a registrar durante las horas centrales del día y que volverán a rondar los 40 grados en muchos lugares. Las temperaturas van a volver a ser significativamente altas en la mitad sur de la península, en Cataluña y en el sur de la isla de Gran Canaria, según las predicciones de la Aemet, que ha avisado además de que se van a registrar lluvias importantes en la mitad noreste y de que van a ser especialmente fuertes en los Pirineos y en la cordillera Ibérica. Ante estas predicciones meteorológicas, se ha activado aviso \"naranja\" (riesgo importante) por las elevadas temperaturas en la comunidad de Andalucía, ya que los termómetros volverán a los 40 grados en muchos lugares de Almería y Málaga. El aviso amarillo (riesgo) se ha activado además en numerosos municipios de Andalucía, Baleares, Castilla-La Mancha, Cataluña, Murcia, la Comunidad Valenciana y Canarias (en la isla de Gran Canaria), ante la previsión de que los termómetros vuelvan a situarse en el entorno de los 40 grados. Además de las elevadas temperaturas, se han activado alertas también en Aragón, Cataluña, Castilla-La Mancha y Comunidad Valenciana ante las tormentas que se van a registrar a las horas centrales del día, que en muchos casos van a ir acompañadas de bolas de granizo de un tamaño grande y con rachas muy fuertes de viento. Las fuertes lluvias previstas también en muchos lugares a las horas centrales del día han justificado que se active la alerta \"amarilla\" (riesgo) en las comunidades de Aragón, Castilla-La Mancha, Cataluña y Comunidad Valenciana, y las precipitaciones llegarán a acumular 15 y 20 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora. El mapa de avisos meteorológicos previsto para hoy se completa con un aviso \"amarillo\" en Cataluña por el fuerte viento -de 50 a 60 kilómetros por hora- y el oleaje -con olas de hasta 3 metros- en la comarca de El Ampurdán (Girona), y con un aviso por risagas en la isla de Menorca. La risaga -una subida muy fuerte del nivel del mar- está prevista para las 19:00 horas de hoy en todo el litoral de la isla y las predicciones apuntan que provocará una subida del nivel del mar de 0,7 metros, según los datos de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología. El mes de agosto comenzó con un primer día muy cálido en todo el país, y en el tercio sur se superaron ayer los 44 grados en algunos puntos, según información de la Aemet. Los termómetros registraron 44,3 grados en Álora (Málaga) y 44,1 en Alhama de Murcia. Durante la jornada de hoy se va a producir un alivio térmico en buena parte del territorio, aunque con calor en el tercio oriental peninsular, pero el fin de semana volverán a subir las temperaturas de forma casi generalizada.

    "text": "Happy New Year everyone! I hope you are all having a great start to 2024. It sure was nice to see the sun. Most of us stayed chilly in the mid to upper 30s for Monday highs. Monday evening will be cool and quiet. Overnight, lows drop to the mid-20s. We will try and add a few degrees for Tuesday afternoon with intervals of sun and clouds. Lower 40s for highs with a southwest wind turning out of the northwest in the afternoon. Dry and mostly sunny Wednesday near 40. Late this week, we are turning our attention to a few different storm systems.\nStill, our confidence is low, but we could see a little bit of a wintry mix Friday into Friday night. No major travel impacts are expected as of now. Maybe a few flurries/showers Saturday and Sunday, but those days look mostly dry. Once we get into early next week, our data is suggesting a larger storm system. This could bring heavier rain and maybe even some snow. Still about a week out, so details are murky and location/track will change, but just wanted to give you an initial heads up that is something we are watching.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV.

    "text": "Una jornada violenta se vivió ayer en Nuevo León con el enfrentamiento de elementos de Fuerza Civil y civiles armados que dejó un saldo de 11 personas abatidas en General Terán. Estos hechos colocaron al estado en el primer lugar en homicidios del país. De acuerdo con el reporte diario de homicidios dolosos generados emitido por la Secretaría de Seguridad y Protección Ciudadana (SSPC), este miércoles 25 de septiembre, Nuevo León reportó 14 homicidios, de los cuales 11 sucedieron en un solo enfrentamiento. En segundo lugar, se posicionó el Estado de México con 10 asesinatos, seguido por Guanajuato y Sinaloa empatados con 7 homicidios, respectivamente y Jalisco con 6. Estos fueron los estados que tuvieron más asesinatos en el país durante el día de ayer.

En un operativo conjunto entre el Ejército Mexicano, la Guardia Nacional y Fuerza Civil, en menos de nueve horas, las autoridades aprehendieron a un hombre armado y abatieron a 11 delincuentes en el municipio de Los Ramones, Nuevo León. Te podría interesar El despliegue de inteligencia fue consecuencia de los hechos violentos ocurridos en General Terán, donde un grupo armado atacó la fachada de la Comandancia local a primeras horas de la mañana. El operativo incluyó patrullajes aéreos y terrestres en los municipios de General Terán, Los Ramones, Los Herrera y Cerralvo, con el objetivo de localizar a los responsables del ataque. Durante el rastreo en el Ejido \"El Carrizo\", en Los Ramones, fue detenido Alejandro “N”, de 30 años, quien portaba vestimenta camuflada, un arma larga y equipo táctico. El sospechoso fue interceptado mientras caminaba por la carretera en actitud sospechosa, lo que permitió su captura sin incidentes. Minutos después de la detención, los efectivos de las fuerzas de seguridad detectaron un convoy compuesto por aproximadamente ocho camionetas, tripuladas por hombres armados, que se desplazaban desde Cerralvo hacia Los Ramones. Ante la presencia de las autoridades, los delincuentes intentaron huir, lo que desató una persecución y un enfrentamiento armado.",
