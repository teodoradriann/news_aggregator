    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Jones County, Iowa from 1901-2000 was 23.0. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Jones County, Iowa experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Jones County, Iowa history.",

This week, DoubleLine Capital said that a 5% rate is the\n\"magic number\" that could allow prices to drop.\n\"If you lower the overall home price, the serviceability becomes more affordable,\" Whitney said. \"That's what I think is invariably going to happen because you're going to have more seniors, the silver tsunami, selling and there are fewer buyers so the give is going to be lower home prices.\"\nAs for now, Whitney said she would advise Millennials to wait before buying, while she would advise boomers to sell.\nBusiness Insider",

    "text": "As feds limit short-term health insurance plans to 4 months, health sharing enrollment soars as solution to coverage gaps. Health sharing offers significant protection, even for catastrophic medical events, at a fraction of the cost of unsubsidized Obamacare plans,” FORT COLLINS, CO, UNITED STATES, November 7, 2024 /— Wiley Long III, Founder, HSA For America EINPresswire.com / -- The Biden Administration has recently finalized a rule restricting short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) policies to a maximum of four months, leaving many Americans searching for alternative solutions to short-term coverage gaps. In response, thousands are turning away from traditional insurance in favor of an increasingly popular and more affordable alternative: health sharing plans . \"We’re seeing a massive surge in health sharing enrollments since the rule change,” said Wiley Long III, President of HSA for America , a leading national broker of both health sharing and traditional health insurance plans. “Health sharing offers significant protection, even for catastrophic medical events, at a fraction of the cost of unsubsidized Obamacare plans.” Background For years, STLDI plans were a popular alternative to Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance policies available on the “Obamacare” Exchanges. Unlike ACA-qualified plans, which can only be purchased during limited open enrollment periods, STLDI plans allowed consumers to buy coverage year-round. However, in an effort to force more people onto overpriced Obamacare plans, these short-term plans are now limited to three months, with only a single one-month renewal allowed. This makes them impractical for long-term coverage gaps, This change leaves many individuals – especially independent contractors and those without employer-sponsored insurance – scrambling to find coverage outside of open enrollment. The result: Many are turning to a more flexible and affordable alternative solution––health sharing plans. About Health Sharing Health sharing plans are affordable, non-insurance alternatives to ACA Marketplace plans. Modeled after mutual aid and fraternal organizations, health sharing plans have surged in popularity, with more than 1.5 million Americans participating, according to the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries. Health Sharing Basics - No Open Enrollment Restrictions. Health sharing plans allow members to enroll at any time, making them a practical solution for those who miss ACA open enrollment. - Significant Cost Savings. Monthly contributions are typically 40% to 50% lower than traditional health insurance premiums. - No Provider Networks. Members can choose any doctor or hospital, as most health sharing plans do not limit their provider networks. - Pre-Existing Condition Restrictions. Many health sharing plans limit or exclude sharing for pre-existing conditions. - Faith-Based and Secular Options. While some health sharing plans are faith-based, many others are non-denominational or completely secular. - Available to individuals, families, and businesses. “For anyone who doesn’t get a big Obamacare subsidy, or who needs to get protection in place outside Open Enrollment, health sharing is definitely worth careful consideration,” says Long.

Dessa vez, Rafael Traci, árbitro de vídeo do duelo, está processando John Textor por danos morais após o dirigente do Glorioso acusar o VAR de manipulação.\nRafael Traci entrou com a ação contra o mandatário Alvinegro nesta quinta-feira (25/7), na 4ª Vara Cível de Curitiba. A defesa do árbitro alega que, nas postagens feitas por\nJohn Textor no Instagram, atacaram a honra de Traci.\n“Na data de 05 de junho de 2024, o réu o qual é o sócio proprietário da SAF – Sociedade Anônima de Futebol do time profissional Botafogo de Futebol de Regatas, publicou em suas redes sociais (Instagram) dois vídeo no qual acusa o autor que atuava junto ao VAR do jogo entre o Botafogo e Palmeira pelo Campeonato Brasileiro de 2023, que este teria induzido o arbitro principal à expulsão do jogador Adryelson, situação que teria colaborado para a derrota do Botafogo pelo placar de 4 x 3”.\nDe acordo com a análise de John Textor, na expulsão do zagueiro Adryelson, no segundo tempo de jogo, Rafael Traci não mostrou as melhores imagens ao Bráulio da Silva Machado, árbitro de campo. O dono do\nBotafogo entende que a expulsão do jogador do Glorioso foi equivocada.\nO áudio do vídeo publicado por Textor\n“Traci instrui o operador de replay a parar o vídeo em uma “imagem congelada”… para dar a FALSA impressão de que a bola está perfeitamente dominada no pé do jogador do Palmeiras. TRACI manipula o replay do vídeo para que MACHADO veja uma imagem da perfeita posse e controle de bola que, na verdade, NUNCA existiu.\nMACHADO confirma sua chegada ao monitor do VAR para ver uma imagem parada que está enganosamente pausada para mostrar posse e controle de bola… mas as condições exigidas pelo DOGSO de posse e controle de bola NUNCA foram configuradas.\nNenhuma das quatro condições de um DOGSO foram atendidas, e o DOGSO exige que TODAS as condições sejam atendidas. Como resultado da manipulação da visualização do vídeo por TRACI para estabelecer de forma enganosa duas condições de DOGSO que NÃO foram cumpridas (posse e controle de bola), MACHADO decidiu confirmar um DOGSO e expulsar o nº 34 Adryelson\nEntão, além da aparente manipulação de uma “imagem congelada” para mostrar uma posse de bola que não existia, o que o Oficial do VAR TRACI escolheu NÃO mostrar ao árbitro da partida?\nHavia um ângulo de câmera melhor para mostrar?\n…porque este é o ângulo da câmera que o árbitro de VAR TRACI não permitiu que o árbitro de campo visse.\nIsso prova (1) que havia possibilidade de chance domínio da bola por parte do Adryelson, (2), que Adryelson realmente tocou na bola primeira, (3) que não houve posse ou controle da bola pelo jogador do Palmeiras, e (4) que o engano da “imagem congelada” mostrando posse de bola não passou de um breve desvio\nO Tribunal de Justiça Desportiva decidiu duas vezes que a decisão do VAR de expulsar o jogador foi um erro, um erro que levou o Palmeiras a superar uma desvantagem de 1 a 3, e vencer o jogo decisivo do campeonato… e transformar uma provável desvantagem de 9 pontos na tabela do Campeonato Brasileiro em uma desvantagem de 3 pontos.\nResta uma pergunta ao Sr. Traci: Por que a apresentação do vídeo foi manipulada para dar a falsa impressão de posse e controle; e porque a o melhor ângulo não foi compartilhado com o árbitro de campo?\nA manipulação da apresentação do vídeo pelo árbitro do VAR Traci claramente destruiu o campeonato de 2023, mas não houve qualquer pedido para que ele esclarecesse as suas ações.”",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Quatre citoyens français encore détenus par Israël après avoir été interceptés en mer dans la nuit de dimanche à lundi à bord de la Flottille de la liberté seront expulsés jeudi et vendredi, a déclaré mercredi le ministre de l’Europe et des Affaires étrangères, Jean-Noël Barrot. Sur le réseau social X, le ministre a salué “l’engagement remarquable” des équipes du Quai d’Orsay, qui ont œuvré à une résolution rapide de la situation, malgré ce qu’il qualifie de “harcèlement et de diffamation” . Il faisait notamment référence à des milliers de messages et appels adressés au réseau diplomatique français, qu’il attribue à une campagne orchestrée par La France Insoumise. Deux autres Français, dont le médecin marseillais Baptiste André, ont déjà été expulsés après avoir accepté de signer un “document de déportation” , que ce dernier juge fallacieux. Parmi les douze passagers du bateau Madleen, huit sont toujours retenus par les autorités israéliennes. On compte notamment l’eurodéputée Rima Hassan et l’activiste Thiago Ávila, placés à l’isolement.\nPour rappel, l’armée israélienne a arraisonné la flottille dans les eaux internationales alors qu’elle se dirigeait vers Gaza pour dénoncer et tenter de briser le blocus imposé à la population. L’opération, menée dans la nuit, a été suivie en direct sur les réseaux sociaux grâce aux publications de Rima Hassan.\nLes militants ont d’abord été encerclés par cinq navires militaires, puis survolés par des drones qui ont largué de la peinture blanche sur leur embarcation humanitaire. Malgré les avertissements israéliens leur intimant de rebrousser chemin, ils ont poursuivi leur route avant d’être interceptés et conduits au port d’Ashdod.\nDimanche, les autorités israéliennes avaient affirmé qu’elles empêcheraient tout accès au territoire palestinien. En réaction, Rima Hassan avait déclaré que le Madleen poursuivrait sa mission. Au cours de la nuit, elle avait lancé une alerte: “C’est la nuit de tous les dangers. Je posterai un message chaque heure tant que nous aurons du réseau. Si tout s’interrompt, c’est qu’Israël s’apprête à nous attaquer.” À bord du Madleen se trouvaient douze passagers, dont six Français et l’activiste climatique Greta Thunberg. À ce stade, quatre personnes, dont Thunberg, ont été expulsées après avoir signé les documents exigés. Les huit autres, notamment Rima Hassan, refusent de le faire, en dénonçant des mentions mensongères, telles que l’aveu d’avoir pénétré illégalement dans les eaux israéliennes, alors que l’opération a eu lieu dans les eaux internationales.\nLa signature de ce document entraîne également une interdiction permanente d’entrée sur le territoire israélien.\nA lire également:",

    "title": "Sorpresa en el Boxeo: una campeona descendiente de un pueblo originario va por un título mundial",
    "text": "Una noticia causó revolución en el boxeo argentino y tiene que ver con una importante boxeadora argentina que combatirá el 1° de febrero por un título mundial en nuestro país. Lo que sin dudas sorprendió a más de uno es que la joven que se subirá al ring para cumplir el sueño de su carrera es descendiente de uno de los pueblos originarios de nuestro país. En las últimas horas habló al respecto y contó momentos de su historia que la llevaron a buscar esta chance mundialista.\nSe trata de Andrea Sánchez, mejor conocida como \"Cobrita\", quien en las semanas venideras representará a la promotora de Arano Box cuando se suba al cuadrilátero a medirse con la venezolana Érika Bolívar -de 7 triunfos (5 por KO), 3 derrotas y un empate- por el cinturón Gold de la Asociación Mundial de Boxeo (AMB). La nacida en Villa Ángela, provincia de Chaco, es descendiente de la comunidad Toba y a su vez hija de un exboxeador de nuestro país. Con la ilusión de conseguir su objetivo, la joven chaqueña será una de las principales estrellas de la velada que tendrá lugar en el Arena Villa Carlos Paz de Córdoba con varias figuras.\nA lo largo de su carrera, Sánchez acumuló un total de 15 combates profesionales de los cuales ganó 10 (2 por KO), perdió 4 y empató el restante. El 20 de mayo del 2017 se consagró campeona argentina y sudamericana minimosca tras vencer a Virginia Cárcamo por la vía rápida en el cuarto asalto siendo uno de los momentos más importantes de su carrera. Seis meses después se colgó la faja intercontinental de la Federación Internacional de Boxeo (FIB) de la mencionada categoría. En 2018 peleó por título del mundo contra la mexicana María Guadalupe Bautista, perdió en dicha presentación en nuestro país y ahora tendrá su revancha.\nSi bien esta vez no será un cinturón de primer orden como sucedió en aquella ocasión -no es el cetro mundial regular de la AMB-, sí será su gran oportunidad para volver a mostrarse y estar de nuevo en el primer plano boxístico. Su último combate se dio en octubre del 2023 y regresará con el sueño de consagrarse e ir por más. De hecho, la actual campeona por la Asociación Mundial de Boxeo es la nacida en México, Yésica Nery Plata y podría enfrentarla en un futuro no muy lejano. En diálogo con Infobae, la \"Cobrita\" se refirió a esta pelea y dijo: \"Será la más importante y voy a ir por todo\". Además, la joven hija de Martín \"Cobra\" Sánchez dio detalles de sus inicios arriba del ring, destacó que el boxeo la sacó de la pobreza y agradeció a su familia por eñseñarle a trabajar y ganarse el pan.\nLa velada completa en Villa Carlos Paz, Córdoba\n- Andrea \"Cobrita\" Sánchez vs. Érika Bolívar - Título Mundial AMB Gold - categoría minimosca.\n- Nahuel \"Caña\" García vs. Diego \"Chacarero\" Ramírez - Título Sudamericano - categoría mediano.\n- Ángel \"Diablito\" Arancibia vs. Sergio Rosalez - Título Argentino - categoría gallo.\n- Denis \"Torino\" Fierro vs. Axel Peralta",

Y el Gobierno de Ejpaña tambien debería hacérselo mirar\n#13 pero si ya gobiernan en la región .... ¿Qué les va a dar más votos?¿hacer algo para que los gallegos los vean preocupados y así mantener sus poltronas o no hacer nada? Es que es la hostia, es como la antítesis de todo. Del PP nunca espero grandes alardes, pero están alcanzando cotas de imbecilidad política nunca vistas.\nNi que fuera el presidente a agachar la lomera a recoger trozos de plástico. Ya lo va a hacer algún currito mal pagado. No estamos hablando de tecnología aeroespacial, que es doblar el lomo y limpiar.\nEs para flipar.\nEdito: nada en contra de las personas que trabajan en la limpieza. No se me entienda mal.\n#17 desgraciadamente sí. En la mesa, nada de hablar de política, no vaya a ser que el rojeras del hijo se inflame.\nY hay muchos en esa mesa. Y en las de la familia no tan cercana, muchos más\nY edito más : Creo que algun primo (como mínimo) se lo ha visto por Ferraz. Sí. Créeme. Sí que los conozco.\n#7 El plan existe y funciona; Justo antes de las elecciones se reparten unas ayudas de dinero publico y vuelven a ganar.\nLosada parece tener una relación cercana con el BNG, lo cual podría influir en su perspectiva política. Su abordaje irónico del plan de la Xunta podría estar teñido por sus conexiones políticas. Me veo onligado a cuestionar la objetividad de la información y considerar las posibles influencias detrás de estas noticias.\n#20 La xunta tiene un plan que no aplicó y ahora está tratando de resolver esto desde la propaganda y culpando al gobierno del estado cuando la competencia en caso de vertido es de la consellería del Mar.",

    "title": "Warehouse employee stunned at company's decision to cut free water for workers amid record profits",
    "text": "The move to stop providing free water in a warehouse left the employee questioning the company’s priorities.\nWhile working for any company or organization, employees expect basic needs like [clean drinking water](https://scoop.upworthy.com/anger-after-video-of-police-officials-destroying-protestors-water-supplies-goes-viral) and proper restrooms to be provided. While many workplaces offer these essentials, some choose not to in an effort to cut costs. A worker, [u/radiantxflower](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1gt82rt/my_boss_just_decided_water_isnt_free_anymore/), faced a similar issue when their company decided to stop providing free bottled drinking water to [employees at the warehouse](https://scoop.upworthy.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-move-forward-with-historic-vote-to-unionize). They took to Reddit to ask the community if such a decision was legal.\n\"My job, which already pays peanuts, has just announced they're no longer providing free water to employees, like actual water. The most basic necessity for human survival,\" the worker began in their post. \"Apparently, the cost of [supplying bottled water](https://scoop.upworthy.com/bottled-water-company-admits-to-polluting-californias-ecosystem-with-arsenic) to the office was 'unsustainable,' so now they're expecting us to either bring our own or buy it from the vending machine they conveniently installed last month.\" They continued, \"Here's the kicker: I work in a warehouse. It's physically demanding and it gets hot in there. We're sweating through 8-10 hour shifts, and now we're supposed to just figure out how to stay hydrated on our own dime?\"\nFrustrated with the company's new policy, they further shared, \"Oh, and let's not forget that the company posted [record profits last quarter](https://scoop.upworthy.com/twitter-user-claims-ce-os-shouldnt-brag-about-profits-while-undercutting-workers-sparks-debate). They're not struggling. They're just choosing to squeeze a little more out of the workers because they can. Meanwhile, the higher-ups are probably sipping on company-paid sparkling water in their air-conditioned offices.\" The worker expressed that the issue wasn't the cost of a bottle of water, but the principle behind the company's decision. \"They're literally nickel-and-diming us on the essential thing we need to do our jobs while acting like we should be grateful [to even have employment](https://scoop.upworthy.com/bakery-is-serving-up-pie-crust-cookies-and-second-chance-employment),\" they shared. \"I'm so sick of this system where every tiny cost gets dumped on the workers while the executives rake in bonuses for 'cost-saving measures.' How is this even legal? How is it not considered a human rights issue to deny people basic necessities while they work for you?\"\n\"Is anyone else out there dealing with this kind of nonsense? Because it's making me question why I'm even putting up with it anymore,\" the worker wondered. People in the comments offered support and advice to the worker. [u/PlatypusDream](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1gt82rt/comment/lxk93cg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) wrote, \"The workplace must (by law in the US) provide water that is safe to drink, free and in sufficient quantities. If any of that is missing, complain to OSHA. They don't f*** around! Tap water meets the requirements, so as long as the tap water is safe to drink, the company is not in violation. ETA: The company cannot restrict access to the water nor to bathrooms.\"\n[u/sympatheticallyWindi](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1gt82rt/comment/lxkpev0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) commented, \"OSHA needs to hear about this, especially since it's a hot warehouse.

    "text": "For exercisers of all abilities, having a goal on the horizon can provide the motivation needed to get outside this time of year. Registration for the TC 10K opened on Wednesday with the theme’s message “where everyone is welcome,” say organizers.\n“You’re welcome to walk, welcome to run, welcome to connect, and, most importantly, welcome to be yourself,” say organizers.\nThe 36th annual event focuses on “inclusivity, community and the joy of moving together,” says organizer, Mark deFrias.\n“Whether you’re a runner or it’s your first time in the event, or you’re a walker, we want everyone to feel like they can participate. And that’s the beauty of the TC-10K,” adds deFrias.\n“No matter you’re ability, no matter where you come from, everyone is welcome.”\nAccording to deFrias, last year’s event brought out more than 8,500 participants and this year’s goal is to see more than 10,000 joggers and walkers sign up.\nIn addition to the theme, the route has a few changes this year. However, deFrias says it will still start and end by the B.C. legislature.\nIn addition to having a goal on the horizon – a decent playlist, or joining a running group, can help by a mile or two.\nThe TC 10K runs on April 27, 2025 and registration opened Wednesday. Early bird registration is $60 for the 10 km and $25 for the family run.\nFor more information, visit TC10K.ca .\nFor a list of running groups in Victoria, visit runguides.com .\nSEE ALSO:\nTC10K run sees a record breaking turnout with over 8.5K participants Thousands turn up for TC 10K Run in Victoria",
