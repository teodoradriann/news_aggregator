    "text": "After pandemic-related supply issues contributed to cammie shortages in the [Marine Corps](https://www.military.com/marine-corps), the service says that the dark green [uniforms](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/military-uniforms/uniform-and-insignia-guide.html) are getting back on shelves. The Marine Corps said it initially started noticing shortages in 2022 of the [combat utility uniform](https://www.military.com/equipment/marine-corps-combat-utility-uniform)s that left exchange stocks empty and Marines having to improvise, including issuing recruits fewer pairs of the Marine pattern, or MARPAT, woodland-camouflage sets. Leadership in the Corps also gave commanders at the battalion level authorization to let troops wear desert pattern uniforms or flame-resistant sets, also known as FROGs, amid the shortage, a necessary departure from the Corps' typical uniformity standards. Until the shortage is expected to fully end this summer, that authorization stands, according to officials.

John Parry, a spokesperson for Marine Corps Installations Command, told Military.com on Thursday. \"All directives pertaining to mitigating the shortfall remain in place until rescinded.\" The service is prioritizing uniform stocking at recruit depots, officer candidate school and other exchanges, also known as the MCX in the Marine Corps. Marines can also place phone orders for uniforms from major Marine Corps bases, or MCBs, Parry said. \"As additional inventory becomes available over the next several months, these items will be shipped to online fulfillment centers,\" Parry said. \"Marines that don't have access to a local MCX uniform store can call the MCB [Quantico](https://www.military.com/base-guide/marine-corps-base-quantico), MCB Lejeune or MCB [Camp Pendleton](https://www.military.com/base-guide/marine-corps-base-camp-pendleton) MCX uniform store and place an order over the phone, and have it shipped to them. At this time, all orders must be pre-paid over the phone.\" Military.com contacted the supplier of the uniforms, American Apparel Inc., which has been producing Marine Corps uniforms since the Gulf War, according to its CEO, Chuck Lambert. He told the publication that it wasn't just the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated supply chain pressures that contributed to the strain. \"The requirements were much higher during those times, as one would expect,\" Lambert said. \"As we entered what many call 'peace times,' the demand for all uniforms went down considerably.\" He explained that as time progressed, his business lost necessary workers and watched as other companies that made products supporting the military went out of business. After restructuring his business, it was in \"good shape,\" but then COVID-19 hit, upending supply chains around the world. \"Our supply chain was decimated, people began to stay home and the government with the COVID subsidies paid people to stay home,\" he said. \"We did in fact increase our wages some 20%-25% to retain as many as we could and did to some degree. But it was costly, and we lost several million dollars but hung in there.\" Amid the shortage, the Marine Corps was only issuing two sets of woodland uniforms to recruits, instead of three, Parry previously told Military.com. Now, they are being issued full sets, he said. Marine leaders were also allowed to let their troops wear alternate uniforms -- until the shortage completely relents, leaders can continue choosing the uniform. \"What we cannot have is a situation where a Marine is wearing unserviceable cammies, because that looks bad for the Corps, and we can't have a situation where that Marine is being given a hard time about those unserviceable cammies,\" Gen. Eric Smith, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said last year about the decision to let troops wear FROGs or desert cammies. While Marine Corps exchanges are taking orders over the phone, not all places where service members can buy uniforms are stocked. As of publication, the [Navy](https://www.military.com/navy) Exchange website said it is still \"experiencing supply delays on this item,\" referencing the MARPAT uniform. A spokesperson for the Navy Exchange Service Command, Kristine Sturkie, said the stock levels for the uniforms are still \"currently constrained and unavailable\" at the Navy exchange, online or otherwise. For Lambert, the shortage caused concern for the future, especially about sustaining a workforce to provide those services. Hiring struggles continue today, Lambert said, despite being contracted to supply over two-thirds of the Corps' 300,000 yearly uniform requirement. If a large [deployment](https://www.military.com/deployment) occurs and uniforms begin flying off the shelves, it would be difficult to keep up with demand given the labor shortage, Lambert said. \"With the continued depletion of the industrial base, the wartime contingency stocks need to be moved to a much higher level and monthly requirements to be leveled out to maintain consistency in production lines,\" he said. \"We cannot respond to shortages as quickly for we don't have the people to produce, and the spin-up time could be devastating when a large deployment happens, and inventory is pulled off the shelf in massive numbers.\" Related: [Marines Authorized to Wear Desert Pattern Uniform at Commanders' Discretion Amid Cammie Shortage](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/09/29/marines-authorized-wear-desert-pattern-uniform-commanders-discretion-amid-cammie-shortage.html) [Story Continues](javascript:void(0);)",

However, the offences do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate, Durham Regional Police said in a press release on Thursday. The police identified the man as Jagdish Pandher from Brampton city. According to the press release, in the early hours of October 8, police responded to a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. Pandher was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes. He fled the area before police arrival, it said. He was ''seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,'' the release said. Police say the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year. ''These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,'' they said. Pandher has been charged with four counts of break-and-enter among other charges, the release said.

    "text": "Jimmy Snuggerud made his big splash at the 2024 IIHF World Junior Championship on Thursday morning. Future St. Louis Blues teammate Otto Stenberg said move over buddy! Snuggerud topped Stenberg in points on the day 4-3, but each netted respective hat tricks for their respective countries in Sweden on Thursday to pace Blues prospects on Day 3. * USA 11, Switzerland 3 -- Snuggerud wasted little time in popping his hat trick, doing it during a four-goal first period for the United States, which improved to 2-0 in group play with its rout of Switzerland. Ahead 1-0, Snuggerud scored an unassisted goal at 3:21 to make it 2-0. Snuggerud struck for his second at 8:11 to make it 3-0 off a feed from Cutter Gauthier. After Switzerland cut the deficit to 3-1, Snuggerud completed the hat trick at 12:36 on assists from Gauthier and Rutger McGroarty to give USA a 4-1 lead. And before the period ended, Snuggerud added an assist on Zeev Buium's goal at 18:29 to give USA a decisive 5-1 edge. Snuggerud, the 23rd pick in the 2022 NHL Draft who has four goals and an assist in two games in the tournament, finished with seven shots on goal and was a plus-3 in 13:07. * Sweden 5, Germany 0 -- Stenberg, the 25th pick in the 2023 NHL Draft, wanted in on the fun himself after Snuggerud's performance. The forward scored three of Sweden's first four goals to keep the home side not only unbeaten in group play but unscored upon as well. Stenberg opened the scoring for the Swedes at 15:48 of the first period on an assist from David Edstrom to make it 1-0. After Mattias Havelid made it 2-0 in the second period with Blues defensive prospect Theo Lindstein (29th overall pick in the 2023 draft) assisting, Stenberg struck twice in less than three minutes. He would make it 4-0 with his second at 6:16 of the third period. And hats would be in order for Stenberg when he made it 5-0 at 9:02. Stenberg was a plus-2 and had five shots in 13:58, while Lindstein, who has three assists in two games, was a plus-3 in 18:16. Someone benefitted from Doug Armstrong being in the building today when the Blues general manager flew over to take in the tournament beginning today and had some thoughts on the prospects from his conversation with the media Wednesday . Here's Blues interim coach Drew Bannister after practice on Thursday, before Stenberg's performance. \"I heard this morning that Snuggerud had three goals there this morning, so it's good to see a lot of our prospects doing well overseas right now,\" Bannister said. \"That's a great tournament for those players to be involved with and I think we have seven guys right now, so that's a great thing for the organization to have that kind of depth in that tournament. I think Doug mentioned it's usually a19-year-old tournament and for us to have five or six of them that are 18-year-olds, that's pretty impressive for that tournament.\" View the original article to see embedded media. Bannister did get a close up view of a number of the Blues prospects during prospect camp back in early July. \"The thing I noticed the most this year was the detail in some of our younger players,\" he said. \"You don't always get to see that, especially with the kids coming out of junior. I was really impressed with players that came this year, especially the drafted players in this year's draft. Doug and the staff did an outstanding job in finding those players. I think moving forward here, whether it's two or three years down the road, it does take some of those kids a little bit longer to develop, but there's some real good players that are coming through this and (having) long tenures.\"",

    "title": "Revolutionizing Landscapes: The Surge in Artificial Grass",
    "text": "Revolutionizing Landscapes: The Surge in Artificial Grass Installation The surge in demand for artificial grass installation is reshaping how homeowners and businesses approach landscaping. The advantages of artificial turf are becoming increasingly clear, leading to a growing number of installations across various properties. This shift is driven by a combination of economic, environmental, and aesthetic factors. Artificial grass installation is not limited to residential lawns. It is also gaining popularity in a variety of other settings. Sports fields and recreational areas, for instance, have long been utilizing artificial turf due to its durability and ability The Appeal of Artificial Turf Artificial turf [https://www.alwaysgreenturfaz.com/#:~:text=of%20Artificial%20Grass%20%26-,Artificial%20Turf,-Residential%20Landscaping] offers numerous benefits that natural grass simply cannot match. One of the most significant advantages is its low maintenance requirements. Unlike natural grass, which demands regular watering, mowing, and fertilizing, artificial grass stays green and lush with minimal upkeep. This is particularly appealing in regions like Arizona, where water conservation is a critical concern. Additionally, artificial grass provides a consistent appearance throughout the year. Natural grass can suffer from patchiness, discoloration, and weed invasions, especially in extreme weather conditions. In contrast, artificial grass maintains its vibrant look regardless of the season, ensuring a visually appealing landscape at all times. Environmental and Economic Benefits The environmental benefits of artificial grass installation are substantial. Water conservation is a top priority in many areas, and artificial grass significantly reduces the need for irrigation. This not only conserves a precious natural resource but also translates to lower water bills for homeowners and businesses. In a region like Arizona, where drought conditions are common, this can make a significant impact. Moreover, artificial turf eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which can have harmful effects on the environment.

    "text": "Keine Schule mehr in Löwensen: Das Aus für die Außenstelle der Herderschule ist besiegelt\nDie Löwenser Schule (re.) befindet sich direkt neben dem Kindergarten. Daher ist eine Nachnutzung der Schule durch eine Kita-Gruppe im Gespräch.\nQuelle: Carlhermann Schmitt\nLöwensen. Die Außenstelle der Herderschule in Löwensen wird zum Ende des laufenden Schuljahres geschlossen. Das hat der Rat der Stadt Bad Pyrmont am Dienstag bei sechs Enthaltungen und einer Gegenstimme beschlossen. Die Verwaltung wurde beauftragt, eine entsprechende Zustimmung der Schulbehörde einzuholen.\nLaut Darstellung der Stadtverwaltung wohnen nicht genügend Kinder im Einzugsgebiet der Schule (Thal und Löwensen), um die erforderlichen Klassenstärken zu erreichen. Nur durch die Beförderung einiger Schülerinnen und Schüler aus dem Stadtgebiet zur Schul-Außenstelle in Löwensen, sei es in den letzten Jahren gelungen, 18 bis 21 Kinder zusammen zu bekommen. Die Einschulung erfolgte bislang alle zwei Jahre. Nach zwei Jahren wechselten die Kinder an die Hauptstelle der Herderschule.\nUnterrichtsversorgung ist gering\nZum kommenden Schuljahr hätten sich keine Familien aus der Kernstadt mehr für die Außenstelle in Löwensen mehr entschieden. Als problematisch wird auch die Praxis angesehen, dass Lehrkräfte innerhalb zu kurzer Pausenzeiten zwischen Haupt- und Außenstelle der Herderschule hin- und herfahren müssen. Die Unterrichtsversorgung an der Herderschule liege derzeit bei 85 Prozent - ein vergleichsweise schlechter Wert. Die Aufrechterhaltung der Außenstelle führe durch die Fahrtzeiten zu einer weiteren Verringerung der effektiven Unterrichtszeit.\nEltern würden sich schlichtweg für andere Schulen entscheiden, sagte Heike Beckord (SPD) in der Ratssitzung. „Wenn wir keine Lehrkräfte haben, die dort hingehen und keine Kinder, die dort hingehen, brauchen wir dort auch keine Schule.“ Sinnvoller sei es, in dem frei werdenden Gebäude eine zusätzliche Kita-Gruppe einzurichten - die Beratungen diesbezüglich liefen noch. Einen entsprechenden Antrag hatte die Gruppe SPD/Grüne/WiR/Boldt bereits im Frühjahr verfasst. Begründet wird das Vorhaben damit, dass sich das Schulgebäude direkt neben einem Kindergarten befindet, in dem der Platz derzeit zu knapp ist, um den Betreuungsbedarf zu decken.\nHerderschule befürworte Entscheidung\nDie Schließung der Löwenser Grundschule sei schmerzlich, geschehe aber nach Absprache mit der Elternschaft, sagte Brigitte Nagel (CDU). Auch die Herderschule selbst befürworte die Entscheidung, da der Betrieb der Außenstelle mangels Lehrkräften nicht mehr aufrecht erhalten werden könne.\nCarolin Muschter (INTAKT) teilte mit, die Schließung zu besiegeln, sei eine „unschöne Aufgabe“. „Dafür stimmen, das werden wir nicht können“, sagte Muschter. Daher wolle sie sich enthalten. Das Grundproblem sei der Lehrermangel, dem entgegengewirkt werden müsse.\nDEWEZET",
