    "title": "Scientists fear political meddling after Ontario premier vows to hunt down anyone testing on dogs | CBC News",
    "text": "Some researchers say they're concerned about possible political interference in science after Ontario's premier said he would be \"hunting down\" scientists who use dogs and cats in medical studies.\nOn Tuesday, Premier Doug Ford said it was unacceptable for beagles to be used in cardiac research that had been approved by London's Lawson Research Institute and St. Joseph's Health Care London, and promised to introduce legislation to ban testing on certain animals.\n\"I have now directed our team to start hunting down anyone else doing research on dogs or cats,\" Ford told a news conference in Windsor. \"If you're doing this with dogs or cats, you gotta stop before I catch you. ... We're going to legislate this ... You aren't gonna be going after animals like that.\"\nFile photo shows a beagle, a dog breed that was being used by medical researchers in London, Ont., as part of heart research. (PETA) Félix Proulx-Giraldeau is executive director of Evidence for Democracy, which advocates for integrating scientific evidence in government decision-making.\nProulx-Giraldeau took issue with Ford referencing specific medical work.\n\"In this case, what was a little bit concerning was the threat that seemed to be directly addressed to certain researchers,\" he said.\n\"We have a strong and independent ethics board in Canada, and their job is specifically to review and oversee all research to ensure it's humane and necessary. My concern is that when politicians publicly direct what kinds of research can or cannot be done, especially with language that sounds like a threat, it risks bypassing those established processes.\"\nFord made the comments against the use of dogs and cats in medical studies when he was in Windsor on Tuesday. He also said he'd legislate an end to the practice. (Justin Escoto/CBC) Ford's comments came after a report by the Investigative Journalism Bureau at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health revealed researchers were inducing three-hour heart attacks in dogs before euthanizing them.\nOn Monday, St. Joseph's said it would immediately end research involving dogs \"following consultations with the province.\"\nCBC News has made multiple requests for an interview, but the hospital has declined. Ford's office has not responded to questions about whether it directly ordered the cardiac testing to end.\nPremier Doug Ford warns Ontario scientists doing medical tests on dogs to 'stop before I catch you' London hospital ending controversial research studies on dogs following outcry Overstepping oversight committees Institutions with researchers seeking federal funding are also required to have an animal care committee (ACC) to oversee any animal-based research.\nLawson Research Institute's ACC is through Western University in London.\nSt. Joseph's Health Care Centre in London said Monday that it would 'immediately cease' research involving dogs. (CBC News) \"I can tell you from my many years on the ACC, there isn't a single researcher, veterinarian, vet tech or animal care worker that doesn't have animal welfare at heart,\" Western ACC chair Arthur Brown said. \"But there's an equal amount of pride and accomplishment in terms of what we've been able to do in terms of scientific, and in particular medical, advancements. It's a nuanced and complex issue.\n The Investigative Journalism Bureau's article \"brought out an emotional response in many people, and this included the premier, so it's sort of understandable how he would want to respond. I just wish he would have taken a step back.\"\nBrendon Samuels, who served on Western's ethics committee when he was a graduate student, thinks the hospital's decision to end its animal research came down to political pressure.\n\"It's a bit unusual and unprecedented in the sense that normally if research activities were to be discontinued, it would come at the direction of a regulatory body that would have good reason for doing that,\" he said, adding that welfare committees also check on animals' status throughout the research process.\nBrendon Samuels has a PhD in biology and sat on an animal research ethics committee when he was a graduate student. (Michelle Both/CBC) \"This is overstepping the role of oversight bodies and expert consensus to deal with issues on the front lines. I don't think it is appropriate for politicians to be micromanaging, inserting themselves and arbitrating what is considered proper or improper in these regulated environments,\" Samuels said.\nEroding public trust The broader concern of politicians interfering with research, according to Proulx-Giraldeau, is an erosion of public trust in science.\n\"It makes it look like evidence is secondary to political opinion,\" he said, pointing to cuts to medical and other scientific research in the U.S. since the start early this year of President Donald Trump's second administration.\nMedical professionals weigh in as Londoners react to secret dog study at St. Joseph's hospital The U.S. is cutting billions from science. Canadian researchers say it's time to step up \"When we see political figures discourage researchers from pursuing certain topics, even those with potential benefits, it actually weakens our research environment as a whole and our global reputation when it comes to research.\"\nProulx-Giraldeau said political interference also perpetuates myths that scientists are paid by the government to do as they're told.\nFélix Proulx-Giraldeau is interim executive director at Evidence for Democracy, an organization that advocates for integrating scientific evidence in government decision making. (Submitted by Félix Proulx-Giraldeau) \"This is not true in reality, so when we have examples like this of science being steered in a direction that works against independence … it really works against the public image of science.\"\nStill, all three researchers agree that politicians should have a voice in scientific research, so long as it is informed.\n\"All research is political. What questions we ask, what we invest resources into, how we approach those questions and how we publish those results is culturally determined and political,\" Samuels said. \"I think politicians have an important role to play in driving forward regulatory improvements.\"\nBrown said political involvement also allows the public to be part of scientific discussion.\n\"I think the public should have a say through their politicians, who then enact regulations that are carried out for them. That's what we do have [already] — we just need to use it or let it operate correctly.\"",

    "text": "The Lao leader stressed that the great and comprehensive achievements attained by the Vietnamese Party, State, and people continue to be a significant source of encouragement for Laos in its endeavours of national defence, construction, and development. The Vietnamese state leader expressed his delight at the significant achievements that the Lao Party, State, and people have recorded in recent times, showing his belief that Laos will overcome current challenges and successfully implement the Resolution of the 11th Party Congress and the 9th socio-economic development plan for the 2021-2025 period. The two sides expressed joy and highly valued important achievements in the bilateral cooperation across all fields, and agreed to focus on implementing high-level cooperation agreements between the two countries, especially the Vietnam-Laos Bilateral Trade Agreement, and the Vietnam-Laos cooperation strategy agreement for the 2021-2030 period. The two countries will continue to maintain visits and meetings at all levels, positively seek solutions to difficulties and challenges, enhance the effectiveness of bilateral cooperation mechanisms, and closely coordinate on strategic issues related to security and development of each country. Host and guest agreed to continue effectively implementing protocols and defence and security cooperation plans signed, and work closely to identify breakthrough measures to mobilise resources for economic cooperation between the two countries, towards realising the target of 10-15% growth in two-way trade in 2024. They highly valued the completion of several exemplary cooperation projects, and agreed to exert efforts to accelerate the development of other key projects in energy, mining, and infrastructure connectivity. The leaders also underlined the need to create favourable and transparent environment for investment cooperation; and promote collaboration in education – training, science and digital transformation, and cooperation between localities of the two countries, especially border ones. Siphandone affirmed his commitment to continuing to vigorously implement high-level agreements between the two countries, particularly in economic cooperation, to bring more tangible benefits for the two peoples. The leaders also exchanged views on regional and international issues, agreeing that amidst the rapidly changing and complex global situation, it is necessary to enhance coordination and mutual support at multilateral forums, especially the United Nations, ASEAN, and Mekong sub-regional cooperation mechanisms. President To Lam emphasised Vietnam's readiness to continue supporting Laos in successfully assuming the role of the ASEAN Chair and the President of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) in 2024, thus contributing to improving Laos's role and position in the region and the world at large./. /",

Punto di Gaia Moroni e l’Italia vince il Torneo Wevza grazie al 15-12 finale.\nI PROTAGONISTI-\nGaetano Gagliardi (Allenatore Italia)- « C’è grandissima soddisfazione perché quando giochi in casa in realtà non è mai semplice. Il pubblico ti aiuta e la pressione a volte può essere un aspetto insidioso. Sei costretto a fare bene. Abbiamo iniziato questo torneo con qualche difficoltà seppur abbiamo vinto il girone; molto bene ieri in semifinale contro l’Olanda. Oggi isiamo stati bravi per un set e mezzo. Abbiamo fatto poi cominciare a giocare la Spagna. Gli altri set sono stati molto combattuti punto a punto e non siamo stati bravi ad aver avuto l’istinto del killer quando dovevamo chiudere la gara. Cosa passa nella testa di un allenatore dopo una vittoria così? Vincere così sicuramente è ancor più bello. Ho cercato in tutti i modi di trovare il modo di aiutare le ragazze e possibilmente di poterle far stare tranquille. Gli Europei? In questo momento penso a tornare a casa e a godermi il successo insieme alla squadra e a tutti coloro che hanno contribuito a questo risultato. Questa qualificazione è di tutti. Del nostro direttore tecnico Marco Mencarelli, di Alessio Trombetta e di tutta quanta la federazione che ovviamente ci ha consentito di assistere a questo grande spettacolo, con un’organizzazione che non ci ha fatto mancare davvero niente. Un grande grazie a tutti. Siamo felicissimi di aver raggiunto questo importante obiettivo ».\nIL TABELLINO-\nITALIA-SPAGNA 3-2 (25-23, 25-18, 25-27, 24-26, 15-12)\nITALIA: Adigwe 30, Esposito 8, Manfredini 20, Allaoui 5, Amoruso 15, Monaco, Bardaro (L).
