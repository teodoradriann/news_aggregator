    "title": "Russian Poet Sentenced To 7 Years In Prison For Reciting Verses Against War In Ukraine - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "Between late February 2022 and earlier this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war, according to a rights group. ADVERTISEMENTA Russian poet, Artyom Kamardin, received a 7-year prison sentence for reciting anti-war verses during a street performance in Moscow, in September 2022. Moscow's Tverskoi District Court convicted Kamardin on charges of making calls undermining national security and inciting hatred.Yegor Shtovba, who participated in the event and recited Kamardin's verses, was sentenced to 5 1\\/2 years on the same charges.Kamardin had told the court he did not know his actions broke the law and asked for mercy.\"I am not a hero, and going to prison for my beliefs was never in my plans,\" he said in a statement, posted on his supporters' Telegram channel.The gathering next to the monument to poet Vladimir Mayakovsky was held days after President Vladimir Putin ordered a mobilization of 300,000 reservists amid Moscow's military setbacks in Ukraine. The widely unpopular move prompted hundreds of thousands to flee Russia to avoid being recruited into the military.Police swiftly dispersed the performance and soon arrested Kamardin and several other participants.Russian media quoted Kamardin's friends and his lawyer as saying that police beat and raped him during the arrest. Soon after, he was shown apologizing for his action in a police video released by pro-Kremlin media, his face bruised.Authorities have taken no action to investigate the alleged abuse by police.During Thursday's hearing, Kamardin's wife, Alexandra Popova, was escorted out of the courtroom by bailiffs after she shouted “Shame!” following the verdict. Popova and others were later detained for an unsanctioned \"rally\" outside the court building.Between late February 2022 and earlier this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war while 794 people have been implicated in criminal cases over their anti-war stance, according to the OVD-Info rights group, which tracks political arrests and provides legal assistance.The crackdown has been carried out under a law Moscow adopted days after sending troops to Ukraine that effectively criminalized any public expression about the war deviating from the official narrative.

    "text": "Las reacciones alérgicas a pólenes se adelantan un año más debido al cambio climático. El jefe de Alergología del\nHula, Francisco Carballada, reconoce que ya en diciembre y enero algunos pacientes han tenido síntomas, \"especialmente en los días en los que no llueve\".\nEn concreto, los alérgicos más afectados han sido los sensibilizados al polen de betuláceas (plantas como el abedul, avellano, aliso...) o al de cupresaceas (arizónicas, cipreses, enebro, tuyas...). En ambos casos han percibido problemas como rinitis y congestión, síntomas que algunos confunden con un resfriado. Cuando los árboles polinizan en invierno resulta más frecuente que para los pacientes alérgicos los efectos pasen por un catarro común. Sin embargo, cuando perseveran en el tiempo suelen percatarse de que se trata de algo más.\nEl cambio climático ha extendido el periodo de polinización de plantas y árboles y ha provocado que llueva menos. Así, el polen está más tiempo en suspensión y la población tiene más oportunidades de sensibilizarse y, quien ya lo esté, de sufrir reacciones.\nParalelamente, también contribuye a crear una situación de estrés en las plantas, que se defienden produciendo unas proteínas que son muy alergénicas. Es decir, los alérgicos tienen más oportunidad de tener reacciones y además de que sean más intensas y, al mismo tiempo, se incrementan las alergias.\nA mayores, algunas de esas proteínas están presentes en algunas verduras y hortalizas, como melocotón, manzana y zanahoria, de manera que el cambio climático además de ayudar a que aumenten y se adelanten las alergias a pólenes, también contribuye a que se incremente la sensibilidad frente a esos alimentos.\nLos alérgicos pueden consultar una herramienta con la que cuenta la Sociedad Española de Alergología e Inmunología Clínica llamada pólenes, que especifica el riesgo de las distintas clases en función de la provincia. En el caso de Lugo, el nivel de alerta de las betuláceas es alto tanto para hoy como para mañana, así como el de gramíneas, amarantáceas o plantago.",

    "text": "1 in 4 Aussies believe AI will benefit legal processes New findings show the volume of Australians who think the advent of artificial intelligence will be a boon for key industries. Global cloud-based legal practice management software provider has released the findings of its December Pulse survey, conducted by Resolve Strategic, which was taken from 1,604 Australians between 29 November and 3 December. To continue reading the rest of this article, please log in. Create free account to get unlimited news articles and more! It found that Australians are increasingly embracing AI, with two in three (67 per cent) of respondents noting they believe the emerging tech will benefit key industries such as health, the law and government services. Half (50 per cent) believe AI would benefit doctors and other health professionals by facilitating remote check-ups and digital prescriptions, and almost the same number of people (46 per cent) predict AI will benefit government services, such as passport and licence renewals. When it comes to legal processes, one in four respondents (25 per cent) believe that AI will be beneficial by facilitating remote signings and consultations. This was only slightly less than those who see AI impacting another professional services strand, with 29 per cent expecting it would benefit financial advisers by facilitating real-time financial statements, and 28 per cent predicting it would benefit skilled trades by facilitating remote consultations. There appears to be a slight disconnect in the number of Australians who believe that AI will impact professional services such as law compared to those in professional services anticipating such change – the survey showed that 43 per cent of those in such qualified industries predict AI will impact their daily operations. [The news follows](https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/biglaw/38419-report-firms-less-scared-of-tech-more-likely-to-adopt-ai-in-2024) the recently released Changing Legal Landscape Industry Report, which surveyed 97 Australian law firms, 23 New Zealand law firms, and eight multinational firms operating across Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. That report – produced by Dye & Durham and the Australasian Legal Practice Management Association – found that 15 per cent of Australasian law firms plan to adopt AI in the next 12 months, with 72 per cent of legal teams also set to expand. Speaking about the latest findings, Dye & Durham Australian managing director Dennis Barnhart said that AI was increasingly becoming accepted as a key part of business-as-usual operations in law firms and other professional services organisations. “Adopting technology is fast becoming a competitive edge in client acquisition and retention,’’ he mused. ChatGPT and other AI applications, D&D noted, can improve efficiencies by performing repetitive tasks, which absorb employee hours. “It is becoming recognised that it is more about administration and research,” Mr Barnhart said. “It can free up people to do more value-adding.” [Become a member for free today!](/free-membership)",

    "text": "圖：中國跨境電商敦煌網（DHgate）官網。\\網絡圖片\n　　美國總統特朗普大幅徵收對中國產品的關稅，引發美民眾焦慮，擔憂衣食住行全部漲價。中國老牌跨境電商平台敦煌網（DHgate）近期在美國社交媒體上走紅。截至當地時間4月15日，敦煌網的應用程式在美國蘋果商店下載量已位居總榜第二，僅次於ChatGPT。美國居民Janine向大公報表示，她已下載了敦煌網準備使用。\n　　【大公報訊】美國白宮15日已宣布，對部分中國進口商品關稅最高達245%，並於5月2日起取消小額包裹關稅豁免。自從特朗普宣布對中國徵收對等關稅以來，憂心日用品加價的美國民眾開始大量囤積中國商品。\n　　許多中國供應商和製造商在短視頻平台TikTok分享視頻，介紹「世界工廠」中國的代工模式，吸引外國消費者「從源頭買好貨」。這些視頻揭秘，大量知名品牌的服裝、手袋和其他配飾的生產地源自中國，通過中國的跨境電商網站，即可直接下單購買產品。這大大提升了中國跨境電商平台近期的熱度，被稱為「小黃App」的老牌電商敦煌網意外爆紅，成為美國近期最多下載量的應用程式之一。\n　　下載量暴增940% 排名第二\n　　敦煌網成立於2004年，專注於小額B2B交易，是美國市場最大的中國跨境B2B電商平台之一。該平台擁有超過260萬家註冊商家，覆蓋約 200個國家和地區，在線產品數量超3300萬，涵蓋電子產品、家居和玩具、鞋服、珠寶、健康和美容等。\n　　應用數據提供商Appfigures顯示，4月11日，敦煌網在美國非遊戲類免費iPhone應用排行榜上僅第352位，卻在13日躍升至第6位，14日升至第2位。\n　　據統計，敦煌網13日在iOS平台的下載量驟增至11.75萬次，較30日均值暴漲732%。其中，美國市場的下載量達到6.51萬次，較前一個月激增940%。截至4月15日，敦煌網在美國地區蘋果商店下載量已位於總榜第二，僅次於Chat GPT，超越 TikTok、Instagram等全球熱門應用程式。\n　　此外，中國購物軟件在美國地區蘋果App Store的熱度也隨之高漲。在購物類軟件中，敦煌網、淘寶和SHEIN在4月16日成為下載量排名前三的免費iPhone應用程序。　　\n　　美國亞利桑那州居民Janine向大公報記者表示，她是一個中國跨境電商平台的「狂熱愛好者」，過去經常使用快時尚零售商SHEIN購買衣服，最近則更多使用拼多多旗下的海外電平台Temu以及阿里巴巴。她表示，最喜歡使用Temu，「因為尺碼更加準確」。Janine表示，隨着敦煌網近日爆紅，自己也下載了這個平台的軟件，正打算使用敦煌網購買價格更便宜的衣服。\n　　 揭「品牌溢價的真相」\n　　分析指出，特朗普不斷加碼關稅，以及TikTok上的火爆影片，共同推動了敦煌網的爆紅。TikTok上這些熱門影片點出了「品牌溢價的真相」，歐美銷售許多名牌包都是在中國製造，實際成本低廉，而這些包隨後被送到品牌在歐洲的工廠，貼上品牌logo標籤並重新包裝，使這些包成為「意大利製造」或「法國製造」，並以相當高的價格出售。還有影片指出，一件售價100美元的Lululemon瑜伽服，在中國工廠製造時的實際成本只有5到6美元。在美國售價超過300美元的連帽衫，在中國的製作成本僅為10美元。\n　　美媒指出，中國工廠為西方知名品牌生產許多產品，它們的價格可能遠高於製造成本，部分原因是工廠、物流中間商、品牌標籤和零售商都獲利。特朗普屢次聲稱巨大貿易逆差讓美國「吃虧」，實際巨額利潤仍被美國企業掌控。\n　　不過，美國計劃從5月2日起取消小額包裹關稅豁免，通過敦煌網直接從中國購買便宜的衣物仍可能面臨關稅問題。然而即便算上關稅，這些商品依然要比在美銷售品牌貨便宜許多。彭博社報道，敦煌網上周向商戶發出了「關稅護航計劃」的公開信，承諾為商戶提供支持。\n　　（綜合報道）",

Esta mañana el Papa Francisco se ha levantado y ha desayunado\", indicó el ministerio en su habitual rueda de prensa matutina.\nFrancisco ha desaparecido de la vista del público desde su ingreso a una suite papal especial en el décimo piso del Gemelli, donde ha sido atendido desde el pasado 14 de febrero.\nSin embargo, la negativa del Vaticano a publicar imágenes del papa ha provocado una oleada de especulaciones, a pesar de que la Santa Sede dijo que está alegre y que ha estado alternando el descanso con la lectura.\nFuentes cercanas al papa han asegurado que, pese a su enfermedad, el papa se sigue manteniendo informado e intentando trabajar, leyendo y firmando documentos, escribiendo y hablando con sus colaboradores.\nFrancisco, que llegó al papado en 2013, ha presentado en los últimos años varios problemas de salud, incluyendo inflamación del colon y una operación de hernia.\nAdemás, el pontífice sufre de sobrepeso y padece constantes dolores de cadera y rodilla, lo que le obliga a utilizar una silla de ruedas la mayor parte del tiempo.\nAl papa, además, también le extirparon parte de uno de sus pulmones cuando era joven, lo que lo hizo más propenso a sufrir enfermedades respiratorias.\nAnte los rumores y las dudas, algunos ponen sobre la mesa una eventual renuncia del jesuita, como el cardenal italiano Gianfranco Ravasi, que dijo este viernes que no descartaba la renuncia de Francisco.\n\"El propio Francisco ha dicho que ya había firmado una carta de renuncia al inicio de su pontificado\", afirmó.\nAunque varios religiosos confían en la lucidez de Francisco, no se niegan a que haya una renuncia de su parte.\nEl cardenal francés Jean-Marc Aveline también dijo que, aunque \"confía plenamente en la lucidez del Papa\", no descarta una dimisión.\n\"Si considera que es lo mejor para el bien de la Iglesia, lo hará\", dijo.",
