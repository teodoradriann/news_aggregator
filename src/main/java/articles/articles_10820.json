    "title": "Taylor Swift Secretly Attended Travis Kelce's Games Before Going Public | Fox Sports 1400 | FOX Sports Radio",
    "text": "Pop superstar Taylor Swift reportedly attended Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce 's games secretly before going public with their relationship, according to Chiefs defensive backs coach Dave Merritt. “When [Taylor] started to come around, it was privately,’ Merritt said during an appearance on ' The Sports Shop with Reese and K-Mac ' podcast this week. “She was coming into the stadiums without people knowing until the camera put a big spotlight on it.” Swift was first seen attending the Chiefs' 41-10 win against the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium on September 24 , which followed three preseason and two season games in Week 3. The singer's attendance became a polarizing topic, leading to a spike in the popularity for the NFL -- already the top revenue generating sports league in the world -- among a younger, female demographic, but also garnering a response from some fans who complained about the attention it received. ”There were so many people that were hating the fact that she was being shown on the TV that, you know what? You’re part of our family because you’re with Travis,” Merritt said. “So, therefore, you’re our little sister… You’re part of our family.” Swift had previously confirmed that she and Kelce spent \"significant\" time together before she was initially spotted at Arrowhead Stadium in September, at which point they were already \"a couple,\" when she publicly addressed the relationship for the first time while being featured as Time Magazine 's 'Person of the Year' in December. “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his [['New Heights'] podcast]https://am570lasports.iheart.com/content/2024-02-29-taylor-swift-secretly-attended-travis-kelce-games-going-public-report/, which I thought was metal as hell,” Swift said. “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.” “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” Swift added. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.” Swimmer Stripped of ACC Title For 'Illegal' Celebration Jason Whitlock: Cam Newton's Football Camp Brawl Proves He's Not a Leader Rob Parker Calls on Gregg Popovich to Quit Coaching and Retire Influencer Says Tyreek Hill Broke Her Leg During 'Personal Football Lesson' Tim Wakefield's Widow Has Died Less Than 5 Months After His Death Jason Whitlock: Why Cam Newton Fighting at a Youth Camp is No Surprise Josh Allen's Ex-Girlfriend Breaks Her Silence on 'Crazy' Dating Life Chiefs Parade Shooters Could Use 'Stand Your Ground' Law as Defense: Report Former NFL Player Says Caleb Williams is 'Not Special' Ex-NFL First-Round Draft Pick Damon Arnette Was Arrested Again",

    "text": "La Corte Penal Internacional investigará a Karim Khan por presunto acoso sexual (REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/File Photo) La Corte Penal Internacional (CPI) inició una investigación para determinar si su jefe fiscal, Karim Khan , había incurrido en “mala praxis” tras la divulgación de una información que lo acusaba de un presunto acoso sexual contra una empleada . A pesar de las acusaciones, el jurista británico negó “completamente” los abusos que se le atribuían.\nUna funcionaria de la CPI presentó acusaciones sobre la conducta de Karim Khan a un colega, quien posteriormente informó a los altos directivos de la institución, según informó el diario británico Daily Mail. La mujer estaba tan afectada que terminó en lágrimas, relató el periódico.\n“No hay nada de cierto en las insinuaciones de tal mala conducta. He trabajado en diversos contextos durante 30 años y nadie ha presentado nunca una denuncia de este tipo contra mí”, declaró Khan en un comunicado.\nLa Asamblea de los Estados Parte de la CPI activó el Mecanismo de Supervisión Interno tras “las recientes informaciones públicas”, sin mencionar de forma explícita el artículo del diario británico publicado el fin de semana pasado, que apuntaba directamente a Karim Khan .\nFuncionarios del Mecanismo interrogaron a la “presunta víctima”, pero ella decidió no presentar una queja formal, según se declaró oficialmente. La mujer se negó a confirmar o desmentir la versión proporcionada a los directivos por su colega, informó Daily Mail.\nEdificio de la Corte Penal Internacional en La Haya, Holanda (REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/) En este contexto, el Mecanismo examinará “de manera independiente” las acusaciones, según indicó la Corte, mientras reiteró su “política de tolerancia cero” hacia situaciones de “acoso, incluido el acoso sexual, discriminación y abuso de autoridad”.\nEl acusado expresó que estaba dispuesto a proporcionar toda la información necesaria al Mecanismo de Supervisión Independiente de la Corte.\nLa CPI prometió ponerse en contacto “con todos los individuos aludidos” y garantizar los derechos de todas las partes involucradas, al tiempo que defendió la importancia de la privacidad.\nKarim Khan , quien lidera la Fiscalía de la Corte desde 2021 , afirmó que tanto él como la Corte son víctimas “de un amplio abanico de ataques y amenazas” debido a sus funciones judiciales. “ En los últimos meses, mi familia, incluida mi esposa y mi hijo, también han sido objetivo de ataques”, expresó Khan según Daily Mail.\n“En los últimos meses, mi familia, incluida mi esposa y mi hijo, también han sido objetivo de ataques” (REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria) La Corte Penal Internacional es un tribunal permanente con la capacidad de procesar a individuos por crímenes de guerra, crímenes de lesa humanidad, genocidio y el crimen de agresión en los Estados miembros o cuando estos delitos son cometidos por sus nacionales.\nEn mayo, el Mecanismo de Supervisión Interno de la Corte Penal Internacional recibió una denuncia contra Karim Khan por supuesta mala conducta, pero en ese momento no se abrió una investigación oficial. Según el informe anual de 2024 del Mecanismo, la presunta víctima no confirmó explícitamente las acusaciones durante las conversaciones, lo que impidió el avance hacia una investigación formal.\nEl informe, publicado el pasado viernes, indicó que las acusaciones contra un funcionario electo, que no fue nombrado, habrían violado las normas de la corte sobre acoso . A pesar de que se ofreció remitir el caso a una organización externa, la víctima rechazó presentar una denuncia formal.\n(Con información de Europa Press/Reuters)",

    "title": "NFL Winners and Losers: In post-Tom Brady world, Buccaneers still win NFC South title – Action News Jax",
    "text": "The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' highest paid player, in terms of the salary cap, retired about a year ago. Tom Brady's $35.1 million cap hit accounted for almost $11.5 million more than any other player on the roster. It wasn't ideal, but whatever. Brady was great for the Buccaneers and brought the franchise a Super Bowl title. It was worth a terrible, rebuilding season while the Bucs got their salary cap back in order. Then a funny thing happened. The Buccaneers were pretty good down the stretch. Baker Mayfield, signed to a bargain one-year deal as he tried to revive his career, played well. Players from the Super Bowl season like receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin and linebacker Lavonte David were still productive. Young players like running back Rachaad White, defensive tackle Vita Vea and safety Antoine Winfield Jr. kept getting better. Coach Todd Bowles, who was probably was on the hot seat during a 4-7 start, brought it all together late in the season. Winning the 2023 NFC South wasn't an incredibly high bar to cross, and Sunday's game was really ugly for Tampa's offense, but the Buccaneers will happily take their playoff spot. The Buccaneers beat the Carolina Panthers 9-0 to clinch an NFC South championship. Three field goals held up. The Buccaneers would have been eliminated with a loss, and they did enough to win. Sunday was a slog against a two-win Panthers team. The offense struggled to do much. But the defense was very good, getting the shutout. The defensive performance included a phenomenal play from one of Tampa's superstars. The Panthers were about to take a 7-0 lead when receiver D.J. Chark was running down the sideline. But right before Chark got in, Winfield came in with a clutch hit and knocked the ball loose. The Bucs recovered in the end zone. Instead of a Panthers touchdown, the Bucs had the ball back. It was a massive, season-changing play. .— NFL (@NFL) [@AntoineWJr11]knocked it out for a touchback 👏 📺: [#TBvsCAR]on FOX 📱: Stream on [#NFLPlus] [https://t.co/X0vcyHUoyR] [pic.twitter.com/s8rVqVD4AV] [January 7, 2024] When the Panthers were driving in the fourth quarter, the Bucs got another key turnovers. Carolina had a touchdown taken off the board due to an illegal formation penalty, then Joe Tryon-Shoyinka strip-sacked Bryce Young and Tampa Bay recovered. The Buccaneers ran out the clock after that. It wasn't a pretty win, but nothing has been pretty in the NFC South all season. And nobody will remember how Tampa Bay won the division in Week 18, only that the Bucs won the division and are going to the playoffs. When Brady retired, the Bucs were supposed to fade for a couple seasons. There were plenty of jokes about tanking for Caleb Williams when Tampa Bay announced Mayfield as the starting QB. The New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons had better rosters on paper than the Bucs, and that's a good reason the head coaches from those teams are in trouble after Tampa Bay won the division. The Buccaneers weren't supposed to be in the playoffs, not in this season when Brady was taking up more than 15% of their salary cap. Mayfield and Bowles might have saved their careers with a surprising playoff berth. It wasn't the prettiest division title for Tampa Bay, but it's one worth celebrating. Here are the rest of the winners and losers from the early games in Week 18: WINNERS Derek Carr: At least Carr ended the season on a positive note, individually speaking. The New Orleans Saints weren't getting much out of Carr for most of the season, especially for the $150 million deal they signed him to. But Carr played arguably his two best games to end the regular season. Carr threw four touchdowns and the Saints beat the Atlanta Falcons 48-17. New Orleans rubbed it in a bit by faking a kneeldown and scoring in the final two minutes, and Falcons coach Arthur Smith wasn't happy about that. The Saints didn't win the division because the Buccaneers handled business against the Panthers, but the win kept the Saints alive for a wild-card spot through the afternoon games. Carr's 4th TD pass of the game— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) A.T.'s 2nd TD grab have a day, fellas [#Saints]| 📺: CBS [pic.twitter.com/I0jDL4B7y5] [January 7, 2024] New Orleans can feel a little better about Carr, who threw two touchdowns in a win over the Bucs in Week 17. It took a while to get going. But it's not like the Saints can move on from Carr's massive deal after one season, so it's not too bad to end the season with a couple good games from their quarterback. Jake Browning: Browning doesn't know the next time he'll get a chance to start in the NFL. So he took advantage of his last start this season in place of Joe Burrow. Facing a Cleveland Browns team that had the No. 5 seed wrapped up and sat practically every key player, the Cincinnati Bengals rolled to a 31-14 win. Browning threw three touchdowns and looked pretty good once again. The Bengals had such a big lead, Browning was taken out of the game early in the fourth quarter. Browning did fairly well in his time replacing Burrow. He put enough on tape that he should be considered a priority backup or perhaps even a bridge quarterback for a needy team going forward. He had one last chance to make an impression on Sunday, and made the most of it. LOSERS Doug Pederson: Trevor Lawrence will get a lot of heat for a miserable Jacksonville Jaguars loss on Sunday. Lawrence played poorly, the Jaguars lost 28-20 to the Tennessee Titans and that allowed the Houston Texans to win the AFC South. The Jaguars were eliminated with the loss. The Pittsburgh Steelers got a wild-card spot with the Jaguars loss. A lot will fall on Lawrence and some of that is fair, but he was playing through multiple injuries. He clearly wasn't the same after a high ankle sprain suffered against the Bengals in Week 13. While Lawrence still is responsible for some of his key mistakes, like missing a wide-open Calvin Ridley deep downfield for a potential touchdown in the final two minutes, Pederson can't be let off the hook. TREVOR LAWRENCE AND CALVIN RIDLEY ALMOST HAD A TD N — Mr Matthew CFB (@MrMatthew_CFB) [pic.twitter.com/2cjz6lwiZT] [January 7, 2024] The Jaguars were clearly the most talented team in the division and they're going home. They looked unprepared to play a Titans team that had been eliminated long ago and had to turn to Ryan Tannehill at quarterback with Will Levis injured. The Titans controlled most of the game. The Jaguars were up against the ropes in the third quarter, trailing 28-13, when Pederson decided against a field goal on fourth-and-7, he went for it and Lawrence completed a pass well short of the first down. Later, when the Jaguars had goal-to-go, trailing 28-20, they ran a terrible rollout with Lawrence on third down that he threw away and then he tried to extend the ball over the line on fourth down but was short. Jacksonville had one last chance after that but Lawrence missed Ridley downfield on second down and then threw incomplete on third and fourth down. The Jaguars shrunk in a big moment. Lawrence's critics will be out after the loss. Pederson's critics should be too. Offensive football in New England: As the field turned from green to white in New England under the heavy snow, it became tougher for the New York Jets and New England Patriots to move the ball. And those two teams can't move the ball in perfect conditions. If Sunday was Bill Belichick's last game as Patriots coach, it was an ugly way to go out. The Jets won 17-3, putting it away on a Breece Hall touchdown in the final two minutes, the first touchdown of the game. Snow games are fun, but not when both teams are completely inept on offense. One play summed up the fun. The Patriots had a fourth-and-1 near midfield in the fourth quarter, trailing 6-3. For some inexplicable reason, New England decided to pass it even though Bailey Zappe was 8 of 22 for 65 yards at that point. Zappe threw short, it was predictably knocked incomplete and the Jets took over. The Jets ended up with the win, their first against the Patriots since 2015. A miserable season for New England ended with a rough loss. Then the real drama started with the future of their great coach. Minnesota Vikings: Last season, the Vikings deserved worse. This season, they deserved better. The good luck the Vikings received last season when they won the NFC North reversed this season. Minnesota stayed in the playoff mix until the season finale, but ultimately the Vikings couldn't overcome their injuries, especially at quarterback. The Detroit Lions didn't rest starters even though they had only a small shot to move up from the No. 3 to No. 2 seed in the NFC (a decision that could haunt coach Dan Campbell after tight end Sam LaPorta suffered a knee injury), and the Lions ended the Vikings season. Detroit won 30-20. There will be questions about the Lions secondary after Nick Mullens threw for 396 yards, but Mullens also had a couple of costly picks in the loss. The Vikings have an interesting offseason coming up. Kirk Cousins is a free agent and he's coming off a torn Achilles. Minnesota has a quarterback situation to figure out. After they settle QB, they'll hope for a lot better luck next season.",

    "text": "News / National\nChamisa slams leadership over Chivayo electoral tender scandal\n33 secs ago | Views\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa has raised the alarm over deepening corruption in Zimbabwe, following explosive revelations tying controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo to a US$100 million tender scandal involving the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC).\nThe scandal, which has triggered outrage across political and civic circles, centres on an investigation by South Africa's Financial Intelligence Centre. The probe revealed that Chivayo received R800 million (over US$40 million) from a total of R1.2 billion (approximately US$60 million) paid to Reform CC — a South African-based printing firm contracted to supply election materials for Zimbabwe's disputed 2023 general elections.\nAccording to the report, the deal was marred by large-scale corruption, involving bribery and money laundering. Treasury in Harare is said to have facilitated the payments, with Chivayo pocketing the lion's share despite not being officially listed as a supplier.\nChamisa, responding to the revelations, took to social media to express his disgust and renew calls for systemic reform in Zimbabwe's governance structures.\n\"CORRUPTION STINKS – A FISH ROTS FROM THE HEAD… For almost 27 years, I've stood firm against corruption in all its forms,\" wrote Chamisa. \"Not for applause, not for loves and likes, or to trend, but because I believe Zimbabweans deserve better.\"\nHe stressed that the problem lies not just in individual actors, but in the very system that enables impunity and criminality at the highest levels of leadership.\n\"It's no longer enough to simply point out the rot - we all live it. The time has come to FIX IT,\" he added. \"Our vision is for a transformational and developmental government that serves - not steals. That builds - not bleeds. That empowers - not impoverishes.\"\nChamisa described corruption as both a national betrayal and a moral failure, calling it \"a sin against God\" and \"a betrayal of liberation values.\" He urged citizens to rally behind efforts to overhaul the current political and administrative order, advocating for a renewal of values and public accountability.\nThe Chivayo scandal has reignited debates about the integrity of Zimbabwe's electoral processes and the role of politically connected businesspeople in siphoning public resources. With pressure mounting, observers now await whether authorities will initiate formal investigations or if the matter will, like many before it, fade into silence.\nZEC and Treasury officials have yet to respond publicly to the findings.\nThe scandal, which has triggered outrage across political and civic circles, centres on an investigation by South Africa's Financial Intelligence Centre.

    "title": "El mensaje de una médico de Castellón a los 'runners': \"Correr a las 16.30 en verano....\"",
    "text": "--¿Cuál es el principal riesgo para la salud de las altas temperaturas?\n--Son los golpes de calor, que se producen cuando hay unas condiciones muy extremas y el cuerpo no las puede compensar.\n--¿Y qué signos de alarma nos podrían inducir a pensar que podemos estar ante un golpe de calor?\n--Por las altas temperaturas hay una especie de vasodilatación que hace que se tenga taquicardia, sudoración, mareos. Muchas veces las personas llegan al síncope, que es la pérdida transitoria de la conciencia, simplemente por agotamiento. En algunos pacientes también aparece la dificultad para respirar.\n--¿Y quiénes están en mayor riesgo de sufrir estas circunstancias?\n--Existen muchos factores de riesgo que podrían exponer a los golpes de calor. En cuanto a los factores individuales, estaríamos hablando de pacientes ancianos y niños por la vulnerabilidad para regular la temperatura; personas con condiciones de salud como enfermos renales o cardiópatas, por la medicación que toman. Luego estarían las personas que trabajan al aire libre, sobre todo, en condiciones no tan favorables, por los factores ambientales.\n--¿Para estas personas habría algún tipo de recomendación que podríamos darles?\n--Evitar la exposición a altas temperaturas, con alto indice de humedad y poca hidratación o sin llevar una protección correcta. Evitar la exposición prolongada al sol sin protección y el uso de ropa no adecuada a la exposición de calor que no permita la transpiración adecuada. Junto a ello, evitar la actividad física en horas de mayor incidencia del sol. Yo ayer pasé por el Ribalta a las 4 y media de la tarde y vi a un grupo de runners correr y dije, esto no es normal. Esto no mejora el rendimiento físico en lo absoluto. Lo que expone a un atleta es a sufrir una descompensación.\n--¿O sea que también habría que avisar a los deportistas?\n--Sí, esas no son horas de entrenar. A ver, inicialmente se recomienda entrenar muy temprano en la mañana o ya en horas cercana a la noche, que son más frescas y existe un poquito más de viento.\n--¿Algún otro consejo?\n--Evitar el consumo de alcohol y otras drogas, ya que predispone a una mayor deshidratación así como un estado de hipermetabolismo aumentando el riesgo de golpe de calor. En cuanto a las personas que trabajen en fábricas o en la agricultura, deberían llevar los medios de protección necesarios y evitar estar expuestas a las condiciones de temperatura extrema. De hecho, normalmente la jornada laboral cambia un poco en verano, pues empiezan más temprano o tienden a reducirla un poco para evitar esas temperaturas tan altas.\n--¿Hay algún tipo de dolencias crónicas o fármacos que podrían también agravar la situación de una persona ante las altas temperaturas?\n--Los pacientes cardiópatas y renales son los que más sufren en esta época ya que por el uso de antihipertensivos, diuréticos, suelen descompensarse un poco más. Porque con la deshidratación existe un desequilibrio entre los iones que normalmente están en el cuerpo y si tú das un diurético, pues predispones más a ello. La falta de hidratación que no es solo el consumo de agua sino reposición de los principales iones del cuerpo (sodio, potasio). Pero no es el momento para quitar el diurético, sino de recomendar de no cortar del todo la sal de mesa.\n--A nivel de hidratación, entonces no solo bastaría con beber agua, ¿no?\n--No. Porque los vegetales frescos y las frutas de temporada mantienen mejor aporte de electrolitos y agua para compensar las temperaturas. Es momento de tomar las frutas de temporada, ricas en agua, por ejemplo, la sandía, la fresa, nectarina, mango, piña, porque son ricas en los iones, con muchas propiedades y vitaminas, que nos ayudan a mantenernos estables durante esta época.\n--¿Y el hecho de que se prolonguen los días con altas temperatura también puede tener un efecto perjudicial para la salud?\n--A ver, el tema es que, por los cambios climáticos que ocurren, hay cuestiones que no podemos nosotros manejar, como las olas de calor. Pero lo que sí podemos manejar es ser sensatos y coherentes y tratar de evitar las exposiciones prolongadas al sol sin ningún tipo de medida de protección. Sobre todo los ancianos y los niños tienen una termorregulación que no está muy bien ajustada. A los niños hay que tratar de protegerlos. No es el momento de sobreabrigarlos, sino de ponerles la ropa adecuada, fresca, transpirable; lo mismo con los abuelos. Y tratar de ver y de evitar las descompensaciones, de estar monitorizando más la tensión y ver cómo se van sintiendo. E intentar que la exposición al sol de las personas mayores sea sobre las cinco y media y las seis de la tarde, ya que la incidencia del sol no es tan directa, ni hace tanto calor.\n--Y a nivel de vivienda, ¿hay algún tipo de consejo?\n--En teoría, el usar el uso de ventiladores y aire acondicionado, pero también el exceso del uso de estos equipos también aumenta la sobrecarga eléctrica y eso también genera lo que estamos viviendo con los cambios climáticos.\n-- ¿Y alguna cuestión más que quisiera destacar?\n--Yo creo que lo importante es ser sensatos y entender que, por ejemplo, Castellón es una zona muy turística. Es una zona donde hay segundas residencias. Y las personas que vienen de otros lugares de España a veces no están acostumbrados al tipo de calor de acá. El calor de acá es un calor húmedo, no es un calor seco... Aquí es mucho más importante, tratar de hidratarse y comer bien a lo largo del día, no pasar tanto tiempo exponiéndose al sol en la playa y tratar de evitar las horas en las que la radiación es muy fuerte. Siempre protegerse con una gorra, una visera, un sombrero o usar camisas de protección solar, sobre todo en los niños. Y en los niños menores de seis meses evitar la exposición al sol por el hecho de que no podemos usar ni siquiera un factor de protección solar porque no están testados en niños.\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo",
