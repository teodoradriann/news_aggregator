    "text": "Champions League: Real Madrid 1 (Vini 67) Arsenal 2 (Saka 65, Martinelli 90+3) (Arsenal win 5-1 on aggregate)\nArsenal secured their first Champions League semi-final in 16 years after a historic 2-1 win against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu.\nBukayo Saka, who missed a first-half penalty, fired Arsenal into a 4-0 aggregate lead after 64 minutes, only for the holders to respond immediately when Vinicius Junior nicked the ball off William Saliba before he fired home.\nVinicius’ goal provided Real Madrid with some hope, but Arsenal held on to their three-goal advantage – following Declan Rice’s superb set-piece double at the Emirates eight days ago – before Gabriel Martinelli scored in stoppage time to make it 5-1 on aggregate and complete a memorable night in Spain for Mikel Arteta’s side.\nArsenal, who became the first English team to win twice at the Bernabeu following their victory here 19 years ago, will play Paris St Germain for a place in the final as they bid to be crowned European champions for the first time.\nThe buzz word ahead of Wednesday’s second leg was remontada – Spanish for comeback – with Jude Bellingham insisting Real Madrid were confident they could overturn Arsenal’s 3-0 lead.\nBut the focus of an electric period was on two contentious penalties – one that was awarded to Arsenal, and the other which the hosts were denied.\nBefore the two flashpoints a clearly offside Kylian Mbappé had the ball in the Arsenal net within two minutes and the disallowed goal only encouraged the home fans.\nYet it was Arsenal who had the best opportunities to open the scoring and both chances fell to Saka. On eight minutes, the England winger left David Alba tumbling to the turf before he unleashed a wicked shot on Thibaut Courtois’ goal which required a diving save.\nArsenal were awarded a penalty four minutes later when Raul Asencio was adjudged to have fouled Mikel Merino from Rice’s corner.\nReferee Francois Letexier had not reacted but after he was urged to visit his pitchside monitor, he pointed to the spot.\nCaptain Martin Odegaard took the ball before handing it to Saka. But Arsenal’s star man fluffed an attempted Panenka with Courtois palming the poor penalty away with his left arm.\nAnd 10 minutes later, Real thought they had a penalty of their own.\nRice grappled with Mbappe in the box and the France forward dropped to the deck. Letexier immediately blew his whistle and the Bernabeu erupted.\nBut Rice protested his innocence and a lengthy VAR check followed. In all, four minutes had passed from the initial foul before Letexier was asked to review his on-field decision. Another minute went by as the French official weighed up whether to overrule his own decision. He did and Arsenal survived.\nArsenal were happy to slow the game down – goalkeeper David Raya was booked for timewasting after 36 minutes – and a frustrated Real failed to muster a single shot on goal in the first half. Indeed, it was Courtois who was called into action again at the other end as he denied Martinelli low to his left in stoppage time.\nThe Spanish giants had now failed to score in three-and-a-half matches against Arsenal across the last 19 years. They needed at least three in the following 45 minutes to force extra-time.\nBut it was Arsenal who drew first blood as Saka atoned for his earlier miss. Saka and Odegaard were both involved in a brilliant build-up before Merino played the killer pass and Saka delivered the killer chip. In contrast to his dink from the spot, this time it worked, and the onrushing Courtois could do nothing to prevent Saka’s sublime finish from dropping into the net.\nReal now required four goals to salvage anything from the tie, and they pulled one back immediately when Saliba was caught napping and Vinicius robbed the defender to haul Real level on the night.\nAt that stage, there were still 23 minutes to play, but, in truth, the 15-time European Cup winners never looked like scoring again.\nWhen Mbappé hobbled off with 14 minutes remaining, Arsenal were all but over the line and the crowning moment came in stoppage time when Martinelli sealed a famous win.\nInter Milan 2 (Martinez 58, Pavard 61) Bayern Munich 2 (Kane 52, Dier 76) (Inter win 4-3 on aggregate)\nInter Milan reached the Champions League semi-finals with a 4-3 aggregate win over Bayern Munich after an enthralling 2-2 draw in the second leg of their quarter-final tie at the San Siro on Wednesday.\nThe Italians will face Barcelona next, who they defeated at the semi-final stage in 2010 before going on to beat Bayern in the final to complete the treble, and Simone Inzaghi’s side are still on course to repeat that feat this season.\nIt was a far from comfortable evening for Inter, but they did just enough in a pulsating clash between the top teams from Serie A and the Bundesliga.\nBayern, who lost the first leg 2-1, were the more aggressive side from the off, with Yann Sommer saving a shot on the turn from Thomas Mueller early on.\nA mistake by Nicolo Barella allowed Mueller to steal possession and play a pass into Michael Olise but Alessandro Bastoni nicked the ball off his toe before he could get a shot away.\nInter came close with a Hakan Calhanoglu curled shot from distance but then needed some desperate defending after Konrad Laimer’s pullback from the byline.\nMatteo Darmian blocked down Mueller’s shot and Sommer saved Leroy Sane’s rebound effort, and the side’s went in goalless at the break.\nBayern’s first attack of the second half led to Harry Kane netting his 11th goal of this season’s competition.\nLeon Goretzka played the ball into Kane who took his time before teeing up a shot from a wide angle which he sent through the legs of Dimarco and into the far corner.\nBayern’s joy lasted all of six minutes, as Lautaro Martinez scored from a corner kick. His first headed effort came back off Joshua Kimmich and the Inter striker made no mistake with his shot from the rebound.\nInter went in search of a goal to kill off Bayern and found it within three minutes. Darmian had a shot cleared off the line by Eric Dier and from the resulting corner Benjamin Pavard powered a header past Jonas Urbig.\nBayern, however, refused to give in, and after a short corner, Serge Gnabry floated a ball into the box and Dier’s attempt at a headed cross from the byline ended up finding the net.\nWith 14 minutes still remaining, a nervy ending was guaranteed. Sommer made a diving save from Mueller deep into added time and the hosts held on and for the first time the Germans failed to win away to Inter, and exited the competition.",

    "text": "The Cincinnati Bengals and the Kansas City Chiefs have history, and Ja’Marr Chase is making sure everyone remembers that these teams are not friendly with one another.\nOn January 29, 2023, Cincinnati and Kansas City made national headlines when the Bengals traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for last season’s AFC Championship game . The Joe Burrow-led Bengals had historically given Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs serious problems up to that point. Cincinnati made sure the Chiefs (and their fans) also knew it by calling Kansas City’s stadium “ Burrowhead .”\nPredictably, it backfired , and the Chiefs went on to win a Super Bowl. However, it seems old habits die hard (and rivalries are forever) because Ja’Marr Chase just went scorched earth on the Chiefs’ defense during a recent interview.\nWHEW, BOY.\nJa’Marr Chase didn’t back track at all when asked about his assessment of Chiefs defense. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care. … I’m not Ironman. I can’t throw the ball to myself. It’s a team sport.” pic.twitter.com/KmnaKIcLYe\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags) December 28, 2023",

    "text": "It’s not going to rain — or snow– on this party. The estimated 1 million revelers set to pour into Times Square to ring in 2024 will be treated to comfortable, dry weather, forecasters said. Temperatures are expected to be slightly above average, around 40 degrees, with a light breeze and some clouds around midnight, according to forecasters, but nothing that will obscure the Times Square Ball or celebratory fireworks. New Year’s Day will be in the mid-40’s with some clouds, too and the first week of the new year will be cool and clear, too. “It will generally be a pretty good day for both New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day for New York for this time of year,” said Fox Weather meteorologist Marissa Lautenbacher. After a wet week along most of the northeast, most of the region will also be in the clear for Sunday and Monday, making for easy post-holiday travel. Parts of the West Coast are likely to see continued rain and snow is expected to fall in the Appalachian Mountains and into the Adirondacks, according to meteorologists. The warmest temperatures the Big Apple ever saw for the ball drop was 58 degrees, which it reached when 1966 and 1973 were rung in, according to AccuWeather . The coldest ever was 1 degree on New Year’s Eve in 1917. There is no snow forecast yet for 2024 as Saturday marked the city’s 685th day of its snow drought.",

    "text": "FOTO DE ARCHIVO. El presidente de Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, estrechala mano del mandatario colombiano, Gustavo Petro, durante una reunión bilateral en el Palacio de Itamaraty, en Brasilia, Brasil, el 2 de enero de 2023. REUTERS/Adriano Machado Mientras buena parte de los dirigentes de América Latina repudiaron la decisión del Tribunal Superior de Justicia Venezuela (TSJ) de ratificar el fraude de Nicolás Maduro , los presidentes del subcontinente más cercanos al dictador chavista, Luis Lula da Silva y Gustavo Petro , mantienen el silencio.\nEl primero en salir a expresar su rechazo a la decisión de los jueces controlados por el chavismo fue el chileno Gabriel Boric . “ Hoy el TSJ de Venezuela termina de consolidar el fraude. El régimen de Maduro obviamente acoge con entusiasmo su sentencia que estará signada por la infamia. No hay duda que estamos frente a una dictadura que falsea elecciones, reprime al que piensa distinto y es indiferente ante el exilio más grande del mundo solo comparable con el de Siria producto de una guerra”, apuntó Boric a través de la red social X.\n“He visto a los ojos a miles de venezolanos que claman democracia su patria y que hoy reciben un nuevo portazo. Chile no reconoce este falso triunfo autoproclamado de Maduro y compañía. Seguro por nuestra postura recibiremos (como es costumbre) insultos por parte de sus autoridades. No saben que como decía Huidobro ‘el adjetivo cuando no da vida, mata’, y ellos han asesinado la palabra democracia ”, subrayó.\nEl presidente de Chile, Gabriel Boric (EFE/ Elvis González) Boric recalcó que “la dictadura de Venezuela no es la izquierda. Es posible y necesaria una izquierda continental profundamente democrática y que respete los derechos humanos sin importar el color de quien los vulnere. Un progresismo transformador que mejore las condiciones de vida de su pueblo construyendo comunidad en vez de individualismo, encuentro por sobre polarización. Hacia allá caminamos en Chile”.\nA su turno, el presidente de Uruguay, Luis Lacalle Pou , aseguró que el fallo confirma “el fraude” que denuncia la comunidad internacional.\n“El régimen de Maduro confirma lo que la comunidad internacional viene denunciando: el fraude. Una dictadura que cierra todas las puertas a una vida institucional y democrática de su pueblo. No debemos callar ni cesar en defensa de la causa venezolana”, publicó el mandatario en sus redes sociales.\nLuis Lacalle Pou (EFE/ Gaston Britos) Por su parte, el paraguayo Santiago Peña también repudió la decisión del TSJ: “Lamentamos profundamente la decisión del Gobierno de Venezuela de avanzar en la ratificación de resultados electorales que no reflejan la voluntad del pueblo venezolano. Es inaceptable pretender validar ganadores sin que exista una revisión exhaustiva e independiente de los votos”.\nEn la misma línea se expresó el mandatario de Guatemala, Bernardo Arévalo : “La crisis en Venezuela es indiscutible, y desde Guatemala ya hemos dicho que sus recientes elecciones solo son una demostración de la misma: el régimen de Maduro no es democrático y no reconocemos su fraude”.\n“Los pueblos de todo nuestro continente debemos demandar una salida pacifica, que garantice la voluntad del pueblo y que recupere el país para todos los venezolanos. Nuestra solidaridad con el pueblo hermano de Venezuela, que lucha por su libertad y democracia”, concluyó el guatemalteco.\nEn Colombia fueron los referentes de la oposición los que se refirieron al tema. Primero, el ex presidente Juan Manuel Santos resaltó que “el fallo del Tribunal Supremo de Venezuela es una patraña. Colombia no puede, ni debe avalarlo, como se lo dijimos ayer al Canciller Murillo en la Comisión Asesora de Relaciones Exteriores”. Mientras que el también ex mandatario, Iván Duque , dijo: “El reconocimiento del TSJ a la supuesta victoria del sátrapa de Nicolás Maduro el 28 de julio, es un golpe al pueblo venezolano, a la resistencia democrática liderada por María Corina Machado, a los millones de ciudadanos que anhelan un cambio y a los valerosos testigos electorales que demostraron a través de las actas que Edmundo González ganó por 30 puntos de diferencia”.\nEl Tribunal Supremo de Justicia de Venezuela confirmó este jueves los resultados oficiales de las elecciones del 28 de julio, que dieron la victoria a Nicolás Maduro, lo que ha sido señalado de fraudulento dentro y fuera del país.\n“Convalida esta Sala Electoral los resultados de la elección presidencial del 28 emitidos por el Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE)”, dijo ante altas autoridades del Estado y representantes diplomáticos la presidenta del TSJ, la chavista Caryslia Rodríguez, quien lideró el peritaje judicial del resultado.\nLa sentencia, con la que concluye de manera “inequívoca e irrestricta” la revisión de las elecciones, según dice el texto, se produce 22 días después de que el propio Maduro solicitase este proceso, a través de un recurso de amparo que nunca se conoció y por el que fueron convocados al TSJ los 10 excandidatos presidenciales.\nUruguay figuró, junto a España, la Unión Europea y Estados Unidos, entre los 22 países que solicitaron el viernes pasado la “inmediata publicación de todas las actas originales” de las elecciones del 28 de julio en Venezuela y la verificación “imparcial e independiente” de los resultados de esos comicios, celebrados el pasado 28 de julio.\n(Con información de EFE)",

    "text": "VDH inspections reveal years-long issues inside Colonial Heights nursing home\nCOLONIAL HEIGHTS, Va. (WWBT) -Colonial Heights Police confirm they have now taken 16 nursing home employees into custody and are searching for two more in connection with [an investigation](https://www.12onyourside.com/2024/12/18/multiple-arrests-made-rehab-center-colonial-heights/) into the [Colonial Heights Rehabilitation and Nursing Center](https://colonialheightshc.com/).\nPolice say the arrests stem from an investigation of an elder abuse complaint from the Virginia Department of Adult Protective Service in October.\nThe [Virginia Department of Health](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/) confirms that its Office of Licensure and Certification is also investigating the nursing center. It already has reports from two surprise inspections in 2023 and one in August.\n12 On Your Side got a hold of those reports in response to complaints. The one from April 2023 focuses mainly on failures around COVID-19 protocols, as vaccines were not properly administered. Second doses of boosters were not given out.\nThe report also details staff failing to notify people properly when residents tested positive.\nVDH also found patients were not getting their medicine on time or at all. Patients with cognitive and physical issues were not given the help they needed. There was a repeated failure to develop patient baseline care plans and follow through with those plans.\nThe reports also explain problems with patient-on-patient abuse and a failure to handle the situations appropriately. The findings show staff inadequately trained on how to respond.\nThe reports did not cover the alleged abuse that led to a patient’s death earlier this fall and charges being filed against 18 nursing home employees on Wednesday.\n“These charges include over seven counts of felony abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults, two counts of misdemeanor abuse and neglect of a vulnerable adult and two counts of obstructions as well as 27 counts of falsifying patient records,” Attorney General Jason Miyares said.\nMiyares credits a tip and his Elder Abuse Task Force for the arrests. He now emphasizes the importance of if you see something, say something.\n“That was designed to approve that type of local jurisdiction cooperation in order to investigate cases exactly like these and then also pull our resources together to be able to prosecute these elder abuse cases. And so, we think this is the first of many that you’re going to see because the best way to fight bad information is with good information,” he said.\n12 On Your Side called the Colonial Heights Rehabilitation and Nursing Center on Thursday and was only told they were aware of the events and were cooperating with law enforcement.\nDelegate Mike Cherry says the center has already named a new administrator, and the director of nursing and state officials have been at the facility.\nPerson charged | Charges |\n---|---|\nChristine Gentry | Falsifying patient records (x5) |\nShawanda Jeter (facility director) | - Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults - Resisting or obstructing execution of legal process |\nDanyell Berberich | Falsifying patient records |\nKatiema Booker | Falsifying patient records |\nDanielle Harris | Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults |\nKamesha Kittrell (outstanding warrant) | Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults (x3) |\nPaulette Landes (outstanding warrant) | Resisting or obstructing execution of legal process |\nShakima Brewer | - Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults - Falsifying patient records (x5) |\nMonica Pickering-Harris | Falsifying patient records |\nMiracle Austin | Falsifying patient records |\nVoncelia White | Falsifying patient records |\nAshley Webb | Falsifying patient records |\nRugiatu Contech | Falsifying patient records |\nShacary Faison | Falsifying patient records |\nPaola Ho-Arias | Falsifying patient records |\nNichole Overfield | Falsifying patient records |\nLakisha Young-Johnson | Falsifying patient records |\nRochelle Allen | Falsifying patient records |\nCopyright 2024 WWBT.
