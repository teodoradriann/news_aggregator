    "text": "ANDERSON — Anderson’s tune-up for the Madison County tournament did not go as expected. Kieran Tewari scored 28 points and Yorktown’s bench accounted for its first eight points of the overtime session as the Tigers overcame a second-half Anderson rally and knocked off the Class 4A 10th-ranked Indians 74-72 Thursday night on Phil Buck Court. The Indians dropped to 5-2 on the season with their second straight loss while Yorktown (6-4) has now won five in a row. “We lost shooters and we were helping too much and (Tewari) shot a little better than we thought he would,” Anderson coach Donnie Bowling said. “I think we were overcompensating on the help, and when we were trapping, we were leaving one guy open. They would hit him, and he made the shot.” Early 3-point shooting from Yorktown and foul trouble and poor shooting from Anderson spelled trouble early and doom late. Led by Tewari, the Tigers connected on six of 10 3-point shots in the first half and, while an Anderson defensive adjustment in the third quarter slowed the long-range barrage, Tewari made four more 3-pointers in the second half, and Yorktown built a two-point halftime lead into a commanding 59-49 lead midway through the fourth quarter. But Anderson’s Damien King, saddled with foul trouble throughout, led the comeback. He scored the next 11 Anderson points, including two dunks and two three-point plays, and the Indians trimmed the deficit to 61-60 with 1:08 left. After Yorktown’s Jacob Grim — who finished with 12 points and seven assists — made one of two free throws, King found Javon Warfield for the tying basket. After both teams missed with their opportunities to take the lead, the game went to an extra session. “It’s tough, but Yorktown I’ll give credit, they’re a good team,” Bowling said. “This is just what happens sometimes.” A Christian Townsend layup with 2:47 left gave Anderson the lead at 65-64, its first lead since early in the third quarter. But it was a short-lived advantage as Connor Rowray scored his first — and only — basket for Yorktown. Baskets from Austin Kates and Nate Tyler — like Rowray, Tigers who did not score in regulation — followed, and the Tigers had a 71-65 lead. But King had fouled out, limiting Anderson’s options on offense. Collin Lewis drove for a basket, and Warfield made a pair of free throws to pull the Indians within 71-69, but Tewari made three of four free throws to ice the game before Townsend hit a 3-pointer for the final margin. King finished with 30 points, 11 rebounds and three steals while Warfield scored 20 and Townsend added 14 for the Indians. Matt Moulton scored 13 points for Yorktown. Tuesday, Anderson will begin its quest for a third consecutive Madison County championship when it travels to Pendleton Heights for its first-round game. The Indians defeated the Arabians 47-38 at home in the November season opener and have won seven straight meetings with their county rivals since Bowling took over prior to the 2020-21 season. Anderson is seeking to become the first three-peat champion since PH won three in a row from 2010-2012. “We’ll come back and practice hard (Friday), Saturday and Monday,” Bowling said. “We’ll see what we’ve got against Pendleton. If this doesn’t wake them up, I don’t know what will.” Yorktown pulled away late for a 51-42 junior varsity win over Anderson. The Indians were led by Jalen Jackson with 10 points.",

    "text": "Prepare for an exhilarating journey through the twisted alleys of crime and redemption with the debut novel \"Isolated Chamber: The Powder Keg\" by K. Mann, a fresh voice in the realm of psychological thrillers and science fiction. This gripping narrative has already earned the Literary Titan Gold Book Award and boasts a 5-star rating on Amazon, marking its place as a must-read for fans of intense storytelling. The novel centers around Sil Wochman, a young engineer plagued by a tragic past that has left him despondent and on the brink of self-destruction. His troubled existence is shattered when he leaves work one day and finds the reality he has known is surreally changed. He unwittingly commits a crime, setting off a relentless pursuit by law enforcement and a psychotic genius with a band of merciless mercenaries. As Sil races against time to uncover the truth behind his altered reality, he must outwit his pursuers and confront the demons within. Literary Titan praises the book as \"a gripping narrative... Sil transforms from a dispirited alcoholic to a formidable adversary, challenging assassins and unraveling a child trafficking conspiracy. Mann’s meticulous attention to detail sets this novel apart... The novel’s intricate plot and rich character development make for an absorbing read.\" Escape is a Mind Game: Dare to Defuse Your Reality \"Isolated Chamber: The Powder Keg\" is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and adrenaline, perfect for fans of Dean Koontz and iconic 90s shows like \"The X-Files.\" As one Goodreads reviewer aptly puts it, it's like \"Breaking Bad meets Minority Report meets The Twilight Zone.\" However, be warned, the book is not for the faint-hearted or young readers, with its explicit language, high body count, and mature themes. The book is now available on Kindle , in paperback on Amazon , and is free to Kindle Unlimited members. Immerse yourself in the chaos and resilience of Sil Wochman's world, and find out if he can navigate the powder keg that his life has become. About the Book Sil Wochman's world is a ticking time bomb, a fragile thread suspending him between reality and madness. Once a brilliant engineer, now a tormented soul drowning in the sorrows of his past, Sil’s troubled existence is put to the test when the world around him suddenly changes into a surreal actuality, and a crime he unintentionally commits propels him into the start of a nightmarish chase. Hunted by relentless law enforcement and a psychotic genius commanding a crew of merciless mercenaries, Sil must unravel a web of deceit and confront his deepest fears. This is a tale of survival and sanity clashing amidst the shadows of a twisted world, where every heartbeat might be his last, and the truth is as elusive as the shadowy figures that pursue him. Will Sil emerge as the architect of his own salvation or become a victim to the sinister forces closing in? The fuse is lit, and the clock is ticking in this electrifying journey through the darkest corridors of the human mind. About the Author K. Mann is not just a novelist but a father, husband, engineer, Tau Beta Pi alum, and more. Residing in Central Texas with his family, he infuses his diverse experiences and passions into his writing, promising more thrilling stories to come after \"Powder Keg.\" Media Contact Company Name: Literary Titan Contact Person: Steven Adler Email: Send Email Country: United States Website: https://amzn.to/48w3yRg",
