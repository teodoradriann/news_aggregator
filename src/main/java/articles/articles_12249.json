    "title": "打通视觉与语言隔离 这项首发技术助力安防升级|海康威视_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "图为 海康威视 总部。 李小平/供图\n证券时报记者 李小平\n大模型在安防领域的规模化落地，已初现曙光。在AI（人工智能）安防的升级道路上，“行业一哥”海康威视（002415）再一次引领时代潮流。\n日前，基于海康观澜大模型+DeepSeek“双模”协同，海康威视正式发布“大模型一体化平台”。在业界看来，这不仅是海康威视的又一重大技术突破，也将为千行百业带来新的智能化升级，产业链有望加速变革。\nAI安防迎来技术拐点\n“安防行业正在从此前的小模型进入到大模型时代，从视觉大模型发展到视觉与语言结合的多模态大模型，这是AI技术落地的一次具有里程碑意义的技术拐点。”当记者问及“海康多模态大模型文搜系列产品”的推出意义时，海康威视相关负责人如是说。\n说到AI安防，可以追溯至10年前，海康威视在2015年的安博会上，展示了基于深度学习技术的“猎鹰”和“刀锋”视频结构化服务器，这是行业内首次将深度学习引入安防，也被业界视为行业进入“小模型时代”的开始。\n随后，以人脸识别、车牌识别等为代表的技术，在公安行业、交警行业获得了规模应用。B端的碎片化需求兴起后，AI安防应用又扩展到智慧建筑、能源制造等更广领域。\n不过，小模型时代的安防行业，却存在场景泛化能力缺陷。此后，海康的“观澜”、大华的“星汉”、宇视的“梧桐”、依图的“天问”等大模型相继问世。\n一开始，大模型时代的安防更多聚焦单一感知，即视觉大模型，这也使得图像识别、目标检测和场景理解等方面进步明显。但是，视觉大模型也存在局限，在不断拓展视觉之外的感知能力的同时，安防行业还开启了“视觉+语言”的融合进化。\n海康威视上述负责人称，安防行业里最基本、最广泛的诉求，是监控录像的事后检索。公司的文搜存储系列产品利用多模态大模型，能实现自然语言与视频图像的跨模态信息检索应用，输入一句话、一个词就能秒级检索目标图像，目标检索变得更广、更准、更快、更容易。\n该系列产品是视频监控的核心设备，也是应用最广泛的安防民用产品，不论是大小企业园区、工厂、政府单位，还是沿街的小商铺，都会用到。它的落地，也标志着基于多模态大模型的安防产品，已经开启规模化应用。\n“目前，文搜存储已开展了大量的试点和应用，用户反馈搜索体验良好。”海康威视相关负责人称。\n商业化实测优势明显\n依托海康的观澜大模型技术体系，海康威视还率先将大模型能力直接部署至端侧，推出一系列视觉大模型摄像机。\n以往，智能摄像机在实际应用中，不同场景、不同光照条件、不同天气等均会带来大量误报警告，造成运维成本增加，用户体验不佳，降低事件响应的信任度。\n因此，海康威视结合各类场景的丰富行业知识，构建了预训练大模型，在预训练阶段中增加了各类真实动态场景干扰数据，如雨雪雾天气、强光闪烁、动物移动、振动抖动等，针对不同条件下的情况进行数据增强，大幅提升智能识别的检出与检准率。\n“以往，周界摄像头有小鸟、小狗等动物经过，往往容易出现误报。”该负责人表示。\n而加持视觉大模型后，能够适应多种识别场景。例如面对不同光照、不同天气等多种复杂场景，大模型能够过滤由强光闪烁、振动抖动等带来的动态干扰因素，在同等检出的前提下，有效降低误报。\n据项目实测，视觉大模型周界摄像机的误报率可下降90%以上，高效、精准、及时地发现问题，避免了大量人工审核的烦恼，给应用侧带来实实在在的效率提升。\n赋能千行百业智能化升级\n在软件侧，海康威视近期也在持续推出大模型产品。基于海康观澜大模型+DeepSeek，先后发布了“大模型一体化平台”、全新升级的综合安防管理平台。\n以“大模型一体化平台”为例，用户只需一句话的简单表述，即可完成具体指令；即使复杂工作，通过多轮对话，也能做到 “一句即达”。比如，某市某河流涌入了大量漂浮垃圾，主管单位如何知道这些漂浮物在哪个河段？通过海康观澜大模型+DeepSeek的结合，用户输入 “帮我查一下河流附近有哪些监控点位？”等语言描述，通过多轮对话，平台即可下达漂浮物检测指令，完成复杂任务的派发，帮助查找漂浮物所在河段。\n人工智能技术是海康威视的核心技术之一，早在2006年，海康就组建了算法团队，开始人工智能算法的研究，是最早一批介入到人工智能研发与应用中的公司。2021年初，海康威视正式启动了大规模预训练模型相关的研发工作，并在2023年推出了海康观澜大模型。2024年，在中国信通院组织的大模型标准符合性验证中，观澜大模型获得业内首个模型开发5级评级（卓越级）和业内最高的模型能力4+级（优秀级）评级。\n从硬件到软件，公司持续在行业内率先发布大模型产品，基于的是海康威视在人工智能技术上的持续积累。\n与通用大模型不同，观澜大模型是面向行业的大模型，包括基础大模型、行业大模型和任务大模型三级架构，基于海康威视在智能物联领域的积累，具有更多模态、更懂行业场景、更易部署等优势，致力于深入千行百业，助力客户解决具体问题。\n基于海康威视在智能物联领域的积累和优势，观澜大模型中的物联感知大模型，不仅包括目前处于行业领先水平的视觉大模型，还开发了光纤大模型、X光大模型等物联感知领域的基础大模型，提升物联空间的智能感知能力。例如，在毫米波领域，基于毫米波数据，可解决不明显且难以区分的目标识别问题，海康威视基于毫米波大模型研发的毫米波人检门，使违禁品漏检率下降86%，是业内首个通过中国民航最高A3标准的产品。\n海康威视相关人士表示，未来，海康威视将持续技术创新，继续推出更多性能更优、应用场景更丰富的大模型产品，加快AI的规模化落地，推动千行百业的智能升级。",

    "text": "The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) has welcomed the President’s issuance of Executive Order No. 51 titled “Strengthening the Government’s Diversity and Inclusion Program.” DMW officer-in-charge Leo Hans Cacdac, in a statement, said E.O. 51 underscores the Marcos administration’s commitment to “fostering a work environment that celebrates the unique strengths and perspectives of every Filipino, including our migrant workers and their families.” “At the core of the Department’s mandate is the protection and promotion of the welfare of overseas Filipinos. We recognize that diversity and inclusion are essential principles for ensuring that every Filipino, regardless of background, experience, or circumstance, can thrive. This includes our migrant workers, who make invaluable contributions to the Philippine economy and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect in their workplaces abroad,” Cacdac explained. He said E.O. 51 aligns with the Department’s vision of a truly inclusive Philippine society, where migrant workers are not only valued for their remittances, but also recognized as integral members of our national identity, and partners in shaping our nation’s destiny. The order’s emphasis on accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and equal opportunities resonates with our efforts to empower our migrant workers and equip them with the skills and resources they need to succeed in their chosen fields during the entirety of their labor journey, Cacdac added. He said the DMW was particularly heartened by E.O. 51’s call for the establishment of a Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Council within the government. This Council, with its representation from various sectors, including migrant worker organizations, will serve as a crucial platform for amplifying the voices of marginalized communities and ensuring that their needs are heard and addressed at the highest levels. The DMW stands ready to work closely with other government agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector to create a more inclusive environment for all Filipinos, both here and abroad, Cacdac said.",

También agregó que debido al surgimiento de conflictos sociales, el marco regulatorio peruano se fue volviendo cada vez más complejo.\nLEA TAMBIÉN:[Palamina tras el oro en Puno: alista nuevas perforaciones en zonas auríferas de alta ley]\nFue durante la mesa redonda dedicada a las empresas junior en el marco de proEXPLO 2025, Fernández-Baca formó parte de un panel junto a referentes del sector como David Kelley (CEO de Chakana Copper), Ian Gendall (CEO de DLP Resources) y José Vizquerra (presidente de Silver Mountain Resources), quienes ofrecieron una visión crítica pero optimista sobre el entorno para las junior en el país.\nDavid Kelley, CEO de Chakana Copper, con más de 35 años en la industria minera internacional, afirmó que Perú es uno de los países ideales para el segmento de juniors. “Tiene la combinación correcta de una excelente geología y una buena ley minera que nos ayuda a tener un título asegurado”, sostuvo. No obstante, advirtió que el proceso de los permisos hace difícil mantener el impulso en los proyectos.\nEn esa misma línea, José Vizquerra, presidente de Silver Mountain Resources, comparó el panorama local con el canadiense. “En Canadá, puedes obtener el permiso para perforar en dos meses; en Perú te toma dos años. El tiempo es dinero, porque tú tienes que pagarle a todo el equipo”, indicó. Esta diferencia —señaló— representa una clara desventaja para las junior. “El tiempo es dinero, porque tú tienes que pagarle a todo el equipo”, agregó.\nPor su parte, Álvaro Fernández-Baca recordó que entre 2003 y 2013 se vivió un proceso de “peruanización” del sector: “Antes importábamos perforistas, ahora el Perú los exporta”, destacó.\nLEA TAMBIÉN:[Camino y un hallazgo prometedor de cobre y plata: minerales clave en Arequipa]\nIan Gendall, CEO de DLP Resources, enfatizó que el éxito en exploración no depende solo del financiamiento, sino de una presencia activa en campo. “Tenemos que tener las botas sobre el terreno para asegurarnos de que identificamos los proyectos desde las fases tempranas, independientemente de qué tan buenos o malos sean”, sostuvo.\nA pesar de los retos, el panel organizado por el Instituto de Ingenieros de Minas del Perú (IIMP), coincidió en que el Perú conserva su atractivo para las junior que apuestan por una exploración responsable. La riqueza geológica del país y su capital humano siguen siendo ventajas competitivas frente a otros destinos mineros.",

Bormioli Pharma tested Loop™ PET resin in its packaging, commissioning to independent third parties' additional analysis to verify extractables levels with different solutions, also taking in consideration the worst-case scenario. The results of these tests set a new benchmark for recycled plastic products within the pharmaceutical industry, as the bottles produced with Loop™ PET resin do not release any substance deemed of toxicological relevance1.\nBormioli Pharma's EcoPositive offering, gathering low-impact packaging solutions, currently constitutes 50% of their standard catalogue, contributing to position itself among the players with the broadest sustainable offerings on the international market.\nIn addition to the independent third-party testing commissioned by Bormioli Pharma, LoopTM PET resin was also tested by a worldwide leader in laboratory testing services and on December 13th, 2023 Loop announced that test results confirmed its Loop™ PET resin meets the strict requirements and standards outlined by the European Pharmacopeia (Ph.Eur. 3.1.15, Polyethylene Terephthalate for Containers for Preparations not for Parenteral Uses) and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP <661.1>, Plastic Materials of Construction) and is compliant for use in packaging applications in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\"Through this collaboration with Loop we're strengthening our role as a solid, quality and reliable partner for the pharmaceutical industry\" stated Andrea Lodetti, CEO of Bormioli Pharma . \"Loop Industries shares our values and commitment, and together we made available a new pharma-grade sustainable solution, showing even greater safety standards than traditional ones.\"\nDaniel Solomita, Founder and CEO of Loop Industries , commented \"Through our collaboration with Bormioli Pharma, we have developed an innovative pharmaceutical packaging solution manufactured from 100% recycled virgin quality LoopTM PET resin. This high-quality packaging alternative raises the bar for responsible solutions and helps set a new standard for sustainable packaging in the pharmaceutical industry.\"\n1 Results from an extractables study conducted by an independent, external lab and performed on bottles manufactured with Loop™ PET resin using different simulating solutions.\nAbout Bormioli Pharma\nBormioli Pharma works closely with the pharmaceutical industry and all companies that are working towards the future of healthcare globally.

Her Hope Booths, which can be found throughout the country.\nRolling out spoke with Umanah about her business at\nKeith Lee‘s food truck pop-up in Atlanta.\nWhat do you do with the Hope Booths?\nWe remodel old telephone booths, turning them into three-minute interactive, immersive experiences that spread hope and connect people to local help and support. The whole goal is to make hope and health free and accessible 24/7 for the first time in history.\nWhere did this idea come from?\nThe idea came from my heart, honestly. I looked around and saw the global mental health crisis and realized that people weren’t feeling seen. I wanted to create something innovative that would help people feel deeply seen and connect them with the support they need.\nWhat was the first year you started?\nWe started in 2021.\nHow has it been going?\nSo far, so good. The first two and a half years were spent on prototyping, debuting, collecting data, and ensuring we’re not just doing what’s impressive, but impactful. This past September, we started our installations. Now, we’re getting ready to place them all over the world in prisons, hospitals, schools, street corners, and pretty much everywhere.\nWhere can people support you all?\nYou can experience it yourself or become monthly donors or sponsors. Hopefully, they could be coming to a city near you.\nIs there anything else you’d like to add?\nI just hope if you’re listening to this, that you know that you are deeply loved. You are deeply seen and known. Don’t ever question or doubt that.",

    "text": "News / Health / Health Wire Trader Joe’s organic acai bowl recalled over contamination fears By Sandra McDonald, Los Angeles Times Published: February 20, 2025, 4:11pm Share: Trader Joe’s has recalled a popular frozen dish over possible plastic contamination, the grocery chain said.\nThe organic acai bowl, which sells for $3.99, may contain plastic material, the retailer announced last week. The company encouraged customers who had purchased the bowls, which include berries, bananas, granola and dried coconut, to throw them out or return them. The company did not specify how the possible contamination occurred.\n“At Trader Joe’s, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our customers and Crew Members. With this in mind, we do the daily work to make certain our products meet our stringent food safety expectations,” the grocer said in a statement. “We don’t take any chances when it comes to product safety and quality.”\nIn December, a Trader Joe’s fan page on Instagram announced the product had returned to shelves after a hiatus.\nThe recall follows other recalls that affected Trader Joe’s products: A widespread listeria recall affected some of the brand’s cooked chicken products last year, and last week, an issue with easy-open pull tabs on tuna cans prompted recalls over fears of botulism.\nBetween September and November last year, 26 food recalls hit California, including Fresno-based raw milk infected with the bird flu virus, city of Commerce organic carrots contaminated with E. coli, and cucumbers from Arizona contaminated with salmonella. Experts said testing systems for food have significantly changed over time, making it hard to say if the high number of recalls marks an unusual level of foodborne illnesses.\nMorning Briefing Newsletter Get a rundown of the latest local and regional news every Mon-Fri morning.
