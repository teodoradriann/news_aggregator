    "text": "Bengaluru tops hiring across India’s industries\nBENGALURU, INDIA — Bengaluru has emerged as the top hiring hub across junior, middle, and senior roles across various sectors in India.\nThis is according to Randstad India’s\n2023 Talent Insights Report which is based on 100,000 jobs across tier-1 and tier-2 cities including industries like energy and utilities, construction and infrastructure, telecom, and retail, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and fast-moving consumer durables (FMCD).\nBengaluru accounted for 29-39% of hiring in the energy and utilities industry, depending on seniority level.\nThe city also led construction sector hiring with 23-35% share. In telecom, the city captured 24-30% of jobs, while retail/FMCG/FMCD saw 24-38% of roles filled in Bengaluru.\nDelhi-National Capital Region also ranked among the top metro areas.\n“Over the last year or so, we witnessed some imbalance caused by global volatilities, especially in the\ntech sector,” said Viswanath PS, managing director, Randstad India.\n“However, given the current scenario where organizations across sectors are looking to restructure and strengthen their workforce, we anticipate a strong rectification in terms of hiring intent.”",

    "text": "The Pokemon TCG is experiencing another wave of mark-up fever as resellers snap up new expansion releases at MSRP, only to throw them on eBay and other online marketplaces for substantially more than the original price. While this isn’t unexpected for websites like Facebook Marketplace, fans have recently found marked-up products on Target’s online store, and with no clear indication that a third-party seller is involved.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nRecent Pokemon TCG sets like Surging Sparks and Prismatic Evolutions have seen some of the worst reseller shortages since the Sword and Shield era of the TCG. Due to low product supply, extreme hype over certain cards, and general fear of missing out, singles from both sets have soared in value, while unopened products have been gouged to as much as triple the original price.\nThe primary way to avoid resellers in the Pokemon TCG market is to purchase sets from big box stores. This has made Walmart, Target, and GameStop of the most important retailers for fans of the game. However, players have recently spotted something strange with Target listings of various TCG sets, leading to a backlash from loyal customers.\nTarget Online Store Gives Home to Pokemon TCG Resellers\nAs shared in a social media post by DisTrackers, players have seen listings showing Pokemon TCG products at eye-watering prices. This includes the Prismatic Evolutions Poster Collection listed at $40, when it typically retails at $14.99. This can be seen on Best Buy’s sold-out listing.\nIn the listing for the Poster Collection on Target, the retailer has been called out by shoppers furious with the lack of transparency. The set is not available to pick up or have delivered from a store. However, nowhere on the listing does Target clearly state that the product is coming from a third-party seller, despite the gouged prices. Typically, Target gets its product directly from Pokemon suppliers, and until recently, reseller costs had never been listed on the website.\nIn the comments, one shopper replied, “I just looked up the MSRP. It’s 15 dollars. This is 40. That’s nuts,” while another added, “Ridiculous retail is marking up from msrp.”\nRelated: Pokemon TCG’s Scalping Problem Has Players Ready to Quit the Hobby\nThe most frustrating thing about the markups for many is not knowing where Target is sourcing the cards from. Those who don’t know that the sets are marked up are at risk of purchasing a third-party item without knowing it, or understanding that the set has been marked up well above the normal price.\nOne commenter pointed this out, stating, “Like others I almost got scammed myself by buying 3 of these. No wonder it lets me checkout as Target online usually don’t let me do that anymore as my items get snatched from the cart by bots when checking out. After paying I noticed the total was over $120! Canceled my order right away. Unacceptable for Target to scalp like this. This product retails for $15 and Target trying to sell it for $40!”\nUnfortunately, the Prismatic Evolutions Poster Collection isn’t the only item marked up beyond MSRP. The Prismatic Evolutions Art Bundle, which only shows pictures of generic booster packs, is marked at $80, and the Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin display, which contains eight tins, is a glass-shattering $265. These tins typically retail at $10 each, making the set worth only $80 total.\nThis breach in Pokemon TCG player trust is likely to have long-term impacts on Target, especially at a time when many have been boycotting the store for other reasons. Hopefully, the reseller prices will be removed, so players can continue to access the products at a fair price.",

There’s something that draws you to them, and seeing the support from fans of the show [Scream], I felt validated. “It was beautiful in that moment when I felt so alone, so scared and in a dark place, to feel like they had my back was beautiful.”\nLast January, Barrera told Rolling Stone magazine that she was “at peace” with the situation and continued: “I think everything that happened was very transparent, on both sides, and I know who I am, and I know what I’m doing.” I’ve always said, comes from a place of love, a place of humanity and a place of rights. “Man and a place of peace,” she emphasized, saying, “Freedom is for the people, which should not be controversial. “\nShe concluded her speech by saying: “This should not be up for discussion, so I am very at peace. People who know me from my family know who I am and where I stand, and I think most people in the\nworld know that. this too.\n1713475245\n#Melissa #Barrera #scared #fired #movie #Scream #Gaza #audience #supported\nRelated posts:\nUlm's Historic Triumph: Austrian Duo Leads Basketball Team to German Championship The Canadian in New Brunswick: an arena rises from its ashes The Impact of Coffee on Cholesterol Levels: Insights from Scientific Studies | Pixabay Practices that worsen varicose veins [[콕!건강]If you are diabetic...

    "title": "POOR BABY: Trump Insists He's a 'Legitimate Person' Who is 'Under Siege' in a 'Banana Republic'",
    "text": "This week the Wall Street Journal published an article with a brazenly biased headline saying that \"Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping.\" The article featured quotes and baseless allegations that were almost exclusively by partisan Republicans known for their tendency to shamelessly lie to malign President Biden. Click here to Tweet this article CNN's Oliver Darcy delivered a detailed and damning dissection of the Journal's purely political hit piece. They could have covered Trump, a candidate showing actual signs of a degenerating grip on reality, but no. That would have meant being honest journalists, which is contrary to their corporate mission. SEE THIS: Crybaby Trump Whines that ‘I Am a Political Prisoner,’ then Proves He Has No Idea What that Means After breaking down the numerous journalistic flaws in the Journal's \"reporting,\" Darcy asked \"Where are the stories about Trump’s former inner circle raising questions about his mental fitness?\" Those stories could have included actual on-the-record sources that know Trump well, such as his former communications director, Alyssa Farah Griffin, or his former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley. Darcy also wrote that... \"Republicans accusing their political foe of lacking the mental fitness to hold office is nothing surprising. Such accusations are made every night on Fox News. And Donald Trump, who at 77 years old has also shown plenty of signs of waning mental faculties, including repeatedly falling asleep at his own high-stakes hush money trial, has made the accusation a centerpiece of his campaign. In other words, these accusations from the right aren’t exactly news.\" It may be too much to expect that a Rupert Murdoch rag like the WSJ would actually produce fair coverage of the candidates in this year's presidential election. Although, Democrats hardly need any help from right-wing propagandists to demonstrate the mental unfitness of Trump. He does that exceptionally well all by himself. Virtually every word that comes out of his mouth is evidence of his acute cognitive decline. A perfect example of this occurred on Wednesday during an interview of Trump by his bestie, Sean Hannity of Fox News. Hannity spent half of his time trying guide Trump through leading questions that Trump was too dense to pick up on. For instance, Hannity would pose questions like \"You wouldn't engage in retribution against your political enemies, would you?\" To which Trump would equivocate saying that \"It has to stop,\" but adding that \"I would have every right to go after them.\" Despite his hedging, Trump has every intention of persecuting Biden and other Democrats. He and his MAGA confederates have been explicitly calling for the arrest, incarceration, and even execution of Democrats and other critics.. It's literally laid out in their horrifyingly totalitarian Project 2025 Agenda. However, Trump's latest affirmation of how he is showing \"Signs of Slipping\" is not even behind closed doors. It's right out in the open, and broadcast on Fox News. During the segment with Hannity wherein Trump embraced his hostile and imaginary \"right to go after\" his foes, he unleashed the following stream of nonsensicality... \"Look, what I've gone through nobody's ever gone through. I'm a very legitimate person. I built a great business. Everything's been...I've been under siege. Nobody has ever seen anything like this in this country. Now in other countries, in other third world countries, or Banana Republics as they say, a Banana Republic. We've become a Banana Republic. At the border we've become a Banana Republic. With so many other elements of our country we've become a Banana Republic. You take a look at what's happening with inflation. That's a Banana Republic inflation what we have.\" Convicted felon Trump says something no innocent person ever has to say, \"I am a very legitimate person.\" pic.twitter.com/g0gpWtkpzw— PoliticusUSA (@politicususa) June 6, 2024 Convicted felon Trump says something no innocent person ever has to say, \"I am a very legitimate person.\" pic.twitter.com/g0gpWtkpzw Holy Shih Tzu! It appears that Trump learned a new phrase - Banana Republic - so he felt compelled to repeat it six times in less than twenty seconds. It's behavior that is more commonly observed in proud toddlers who are eager to show off what new knowledge or skill they acquired. In toddlers, it's kind of cute. In 77 year old malignant narcissists, with a weakening grasp on reality and aspirations of authoritarian power, it's sad and somewhat frightening. Trump's remarks also display the severe anxiety and gnawing victimhood (\"under siege\") that has become a hallmark of his perverse persona. In his mind there is no one that has ever lived who was ever more tormented by evil forces, despite the abundance of magnificence that he believes he is responsible for. He is, after all, a \"legitimate person.\" As opposed to what? A Looney Tunes cartoon character? (Okay, that example may be a little too on the nose). Finally, Trump has proven that he has no idea what the phrase \"Banana Republic\" means. He just uses it as an all-purpose pejorative. He mistakenly believes that only small impoverished nations hold their former leaders accountable when they violate the law. And now he's learning the hard way that even America has standards for legal conduct that do not permit him to get away with criminal acts, like he has for much of his business career. And unfortunately for him, his legal problems have only just begun. RELATED STORIES: Be sure to visit and follow News Corpse on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and Threads.
