    "text": "COLLEGE STATION, Texas — Few researchers and teachers have impacted farmers, agriculture and food security globally more than Norman Borlaug, Ph.D. While many hands and minds play a part in ensuring people have food on their tables, Borlaug stands out as a “food hero” who brought sustenance and nourishment to those most in need.\nTexas A&M AgriLife celebrates Borlaug, who is often referred to as the “Father of the Green Revolution,” on the anniversary of his receiving the Nobel Prize on Dec. 11, 1970, for his lifelong work toward food production globally.\nBorlaug was a Distinguished Professor of International Agriculture in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the namesake of The Norman Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture and Development at Texas A&M University.\nThrough dedicated research during the 1960s, Borlaug perfected a dwarf wheat variety that was both resilient and prolific. This groundbreaking work and the planting of this wheat in food-insecure parts of the globe was instrumental in saving over a billion lives worldwide.\nCelebrating Borlaug’s excellence\nIn addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, Borlaug was awarded a U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal for his revolutionary humanitarian efforts that paved the way for improved food productivity.\nDetermined to make a difference, he could be found working in the fields alongside farmers, students, interns and researchers. By developing improved grain varieties, he was able to fulfill his life’s mission and help farmers around the globe feed more of the world’s population.\nHis legacy of “seeding” agricultural production all over the world still resonates today, as the Borlaug Institute implements programs in developing countries worldwide.\nEmbracing his spirit, the institute follows the seven elements of the Borlaug legacy: prevent conflict by addressing poverty and hunger; employ agriculture science to address poverty and hunger; take it to the farmer; engage in an interdisciplinary approach; encourage effective governance and sound policies; promote youth development; and act more and talk less.\nContinuing the legacy\nFighting hunger and poverty together and fulfilling Borlaug’s legacy, the Borlaug Institute is bringing more food to the world by utilizing applied research and training programs from production to consumption in small-holder agricultural communities of the developing world.\nThe institute engages experts from a variety of fields beyond crop and animal production, including environmental sustainability, food safety, nutrition, education, entrepreneurship and public policy.\n“We engage producers, small-holder farmers, in a value-chain approach, helping them identify and then improve production of specific agricultural products for which there is a market,” said Elsa Murano, Ph.D., director of The Borlaug Institute.\n“It could be horticulture crops that are of high value, such as coffee or peppers, or it could be livestock and livestock-derived products,” Murano said. “We then provide them with demonstrations and training on how to do it efficiently, sustainably and with climate-smart strategies that help them cope with extreme conditions, such as droughts.”\nMurano said this focused approach helps elevate people out of poverty and hunger and has generational cascading effects on families and communities.\n“Their improved livelihoods allow them to buy medicines for the family and send their kids to school,” she said. “It really provides them with hope and an opportunity for a better future, and that all begins with agriculture.”\nMurano said Borlaug was a great believer in action.\n“He was all about getting things done,” Murano said. “’Act more, talk less’ was his motto and the Borlaug Institute has taken that to heart. So, through perseverance and action, we continue his legacy.”\n— Laura Muntean\nTexas A&M AgriLife Communications",

Ninety-six per cent of the members approved the strike action.\nThe strike involves machinists mainly based in Renton, Washington, who are responsible for assembling Boeing&CloseCurlyQuote;s best-selling aircraft, including the 737 Max, 777 and 767 models. The walkout is expected to halt production at Boeing&CloseCurlyQuote;s factories in Renton and Everett, potentially costing the company billions in lost revenue.\nUnion members cited inadequate wage increases and dissatisfaction with changes to annual bonus criteria as key reasons for rejecting the contract. Despite Boeing&CloseCurlyQuote;s offer to increase contributions to employee 401(k) retirement accounts and reduce healthcare costs, workers felt the proposal fell short of their demands.\nThe strike has already gained significant attention, with workers picketing outside Boeing&CloseCurlyQuote;s plants, holding signs and playing protest songs. The labour action is a consequence of ongoing tensions between Boeing and its workforce, as the company continues to navigate manufacturing challenges and federal investigations.\nAs the strike unfolds, Boeing and the union are expected to return to the negotiating table.\nThe aerospace company has been facing one problem after another, from its new Starliner astronaut capsule departing the International Space Station leaving its crew stranded in space , conspiracy to defraud the United States in connection with two fatal 737 Max crashes and the ongoing investigation into its merger with Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SPR) misleading investors.\nBoeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defence products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries.\nThe Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) last traded at US$162.77 per share.

    "title": "FBI Finds Chinese State Hacker Malware on Hundreds of U.S. Infrastructure-Related Routers",
    "text": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Wednesday announced they were able to disrupt a massive Chinese cyber-espionage campaign called Volt Typhoon that penetrated critical American infrastructure systems.\nVolt Typhoon was detected and made public by Microsoft’s cybersecurity team in May 2023. Microsoft described the perpetrators as state-sponsored hackers from China who were developing “capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and Asia region during future crises.”\nMicrosoft’s conclusions were backed by the intelligence agencies of the “Five Eyes” alliance: the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. China denied the allegations and accused the Five Eyes nations of pushing “disinformation.”\nVolt Typhoon’s activities were originally thought to be centered on Guam, with the goal of disrupting American network communications across the Pacific in the event of a conflict with China, such as China might cause by invading Taiwan. Further investigation showed the scope of the operation was much greater, with targets including West Coast ports, oil pipelines, and the power grid of Texas.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in December that China was clearly “pre-positioning” cyber warfare assets to “disrupt or destroy that critical infrastructure in the event of a conflict, to either prevent the United States from being able to project power into Asia or to cause societal chaos inside the United States.”\nVolt Typhoon was cited by cybersecurity experts as one of the biggest, most dangerous examples of “living off the land,” a technique in which hackers infiltrate a system without causing any damage or revealing their presence, using tools that mimic normal network activity. As DHS put it, the Chinese operation was all about scouting ahead and preparing for destructive attacks that could be triggered if the U.S. and China came into conflict.\nDOJ said on Wednesday that the U.S. and its allies have stepped up their efforts against threats like Volt Typhoon, and that particular threat has been “disrupted” by purging its malicious software from hundreds of routers. U.S. officials remained certain that Chinese state-sponsored hackers were responsible for the intrusions.\nSean Newell, deputy chief of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, explained that Volt Typhoon’s hackers created a “botnet” hidden inside network routers that concealed their other hacking activities. The compromised routers, which were mostly older Cisco and Netgear models nearing the end of their operational lifespans, allowed the hackers to work in secret, without security programs detecting their unusual network traffic.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party that the nearly-obsolete routers were “easy targets” for the hackers, whose activities targeted water, power, oil, and transportation systems.\nWray said the FBI also believes China will try to interfere in the 2024 elections, as it did in Taiwan’s recent presidential race. He pointed to the tremendous amount of information Chinese applications like TikTok collect about their users as potential espionage weapons since the Chinese military apparatus is legally guaranteed at-will access to all data compiled by Chinese corporations.\n“Today, and literally every day, they’re actively attacking our economic security, engaging in wholesale theft of our innovation, and our personal and corporate data,” said Wray.\nCISA Director Jen Easterly warned that China’s hackers have grown very adept at lurking undetected inside computer systems.\n“They’ve elevated their ability to act like a system administrator so you really can’t tell that’s a Chinese actor,” Easterly said.\nSecurity Week reported some concerns in the cybersecurity community that Volt Typhoon might not be completely “disrupted,” because it was able to penetrate “thousands of organizations,” but the FBI’s court orders covered only hundreds of infected routers.\nThe FBI essentially managed to find a way to order the malware in the infected routers to delete itself, without damaging the routers or the systems that relied upon them. The owners of those routers do not appear to have been warned in advance, but the FBI said it is attempting to notify all of them now and provide some security advice.\nSome hardware experts said the routers may not be completely purged of Volt Typhoon’s influence, so it would be safest to replace them all, as quickly as possible.\nCISA issued a bulletin to router manufacturers this week that explained how Volt Typhoon was able to hijack their hardware. CISA and the FBI asked manufacturers to eliminate the vulnerabilities that were exploited by the Chinese hacking group and “build security into the design, development, and maintenance” of their products. Among the suggestions included in the bulletin was programming routers to download software updates automatically, and making it harder to disable network security remotely.\nAsia National Security Tech China Christopher Wray Cybersecurity Department of Justice FBI hackers",

    "text": "Os países-membros do Mercosul manifestaram nesta quinta-feira (27) “profunda preocupação e enérgica condenação” à tentativa de golpe sofrida pelo governo da Bolívia ontem (26). Em comunicado, os Estados partes e associados do bloco afirmam que o ato descumpre os princípios internacionais da vida democrática e, em particular, do Mercosul. “Em consonância com os princípios do Direito Internacional, rejeitam qualquer tentativa de mudança de poder por meio da violência e de forma inconstitucional que atente contra a vontade popular, soberania, autodeterminação dos povos e que vulnerabilize a estabilidade política e social do país irmão”, informou a nota do bloco. Os membros do Mercosul também expressaram solidariedade e apoio irrestrito à institucionalidade democrática do governo constitucional do presidente Luis Arce e suas autoridades democraticamente eleitas. Atualmente, o Mercosul é formado por Argentina, Brasil, Paraguai e Uruguai. Os estados associados são Chile, Colômbia, Equador, Guiana, Peru e Suriname. A Bolívia encontra-se atualmente em processo final de ingresso no bloco, o que deve ser formalizado na próxima Cúpula de Chefes de Estado do Mercosul, em Assunção, no Paraguai, nos dias 7 e 8 de julho. Todos os países já ratificaram a entrada da Bolívia no Mercosul, inclusive o Brasil. Tentativa de golpe Nesta quarta-feira (26), um grupo de soldados do Exército, liderado pelo general Juan José Zúñiga, se reuniu na praça central Plaza Murillo, onde estão localizados o palácio presidencial e o Congresso boliviano. Com tanques blindados, eles arrombaram uma porta do palácio presidencial, o que permitiu que os soldados entrassem no prédio. O presidente Luis Arce nomeou novos comandantes para as Forças Armadas e os soldados acabaram se retirando do local. Zúñiga e cerca de uma dezena de militares bolivianos já foram presos.

    "text": "The average salary earner can expect a €780 increase in take-home pay as a £1.3 billion tax package comes into effect from tomorrow. The package was announced [ as part of Budget 2024](https://www.newstalk.com/news/budget-2024-what-you-need-to-know-1513729) and includes a series of tax cuts and increases in credits. A single person earning an average annual salary of €47,000 can expect to see an increase in take-home pay of €780 in 2024. A couple earning €100,000 between them will see an increase in take-home pay of €1,560 in 2024. Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said the tax package will ensure over two million people see an increase in their take-home pay. “A key theme of Budget 2024 was to enhance a number of tax incentives for enterprise in Ireland,” he said. Tax credits From tomorrow, the main tax credits (personal, employee and earned income) will all increase by €100 from €1,775 to €1,875. There are also increases to the Home Carer Tax Credit, Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit and Incapacitated Child Tax Credit. The Rent Tax Credit was also increased to €750 for single people, up from €500. The first USC rate cut in 5 years will see the 4.5% rate reduced to 4%. The second USC rate band (2%) was also increased to €25,760 to account for the increase in minimum wage and to ensure full-time workers earning the national minimum wage will remain outside the top rates of USC. Cost-of-living tax package Mr McGrath said the tax package is combined with targeted mortgage interest relief, an extension of the reduction in VAT on electricity and gas, additional energy credits and social protection changes. “This represents a comprehensive response on the part of Government to the cost-of-living challenges faced by households,” he said. The Research and Development tax credit will also increase to 30% for 2024 expenditure, which Mr McGrath said will help businesses “invest in their future productivity”. An increase in the cap on qualifying expenditure from €75 million to €125 million for the Film Tax Credit is subject to State Aid approval.",

    "text": "財經中心／廖珪如報導\n▲核三廠起火事件台電回應。（圖／記者洪正達攝影）\n位於國境之南的屏東縣恆春核三廠今（6）日上午驚傳火警，疑似因廠房內設備起火，現場竄出大量黑煙，引起當地居民恐慌，擔心輻射外洩。有當地民眾十分不滿意核三廠處理程序，與廠方出現衝突。台電回應，該案為空壓機廠房南側發生冷卻水塔火警，不影響爐心安全，也沒有輻射外洩，請民眾放心。\n核三廠也表示，火警原因是核三廠人員載運廢棄材料，到廠區外進行切割時，因為旁邊有廢油，切割時噴濺的火星引發燃燒，才會產生濃煙，不會影響發電。而台電公司也聲明，今（6）日上午11時23分接獲通報，核三廠空壓機廠房南側發生冷卻水塔(地面直立，直徑3米、高度3米，塑膠材質)火警事件，不影響發電及爐心安全。廠內消防隊迅速展開滅火行動，並於11時35分撲滅火勢，現場狀況已受到控制。\n台電指出，空壓機廠房距離2號機約50公尺，不會影響機組安全，輻射亦無外洩之疑慮，請民眾放心。\n更多新聞： 重磅人事！挖台積電「龍脈」　美光延攬前董座劉德音任職 更多新聞： 小鳥害斷電！台電啟動大掃蕩　1200座鳥巢被移除 更多新聞： 新聞幕後／經濟部說話了！台積電千億投美　台灣半導體未來「這樣走」 更多新聞： 這件事真的大條！　李嘉誠把巴拿馬運河兩港口賣給美國人",

Astros general manager Dana Brown said last week that Blubaugh\ncould be promoted to the big league club very soon.\nIf that happens, he would join Daulton Varsho as the only UWM players in the major leagues. Varsho was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2017, and now plays outfield for the Toronto Blue Jays.",

    "text": "Automotive, 5.000 metalmeccanici in corteo a Torino: tra il rinnovo del contratto e la paura dei dazi\nSi tratta dell'ennesimo sciopero dei lavoratori del settore che chiedono agli industriali di sbloccare la trattativa per il rinnovo del contratto collettivo nazionale\nCirca 5.000 lavoratori del settore metalmeccanico questa mattina - venerdì 28 marzo 2025 - sono scesi in piazza per sfilare in corteo da piazza Arbarello fino alla sede dell'Unione Industriali di Torino. Si tratta dell'ennesimo sciopero dei lavoratori del settore che chiedono agli industriali di sbloccare la trattativa per il rinnovo del contratto collettivo nazionale.\nUno sciopero sul quale pesa la crisi internazionale dovuta all'annuncio degli Stati Uniti dell'intenzione di voler applicare dazi del 25% sulle autovetture importate: \"ci preoccupano soprattutto per l'indotto\", spiega Fernando Uliano della segretario generale della Fim-Cisl, \"perché il nostro Paese nelle produzioni delle fabbriche di assemblaggio non esporta moltissimo negli Stati Uniti però è altrettanto vero che la rete della componentistica è fatta di oltre 280mila lavoratori ed è una rete che fornisce case automobilistiche per esempio tedesche che esportano molto in America e quindi un contraccolpo potrebbe determinarsi da questo punto di vista\".\nPiù ottimista il segretario torinese della Uilm, Luigi Paone, che si dice non preoccupato sulle ripercussioni che ci saranno a Torino. Per Edi Lazzi della Fiom invece la soluzione deve passare attraverso una politica che prima guardi ai conflitti internazionali bellici ed economici. L'adesione allo sciopero è stata alta nel torinese con picchi del 90%.\nIscriviti al canale TorinoToday su WhatsApp e segui la nostra pagina Facebook.",

Dieciocho personas lesionadas, entre ellas cinco de gravedad, es el saldo de un accidente entre un autobús de pasaje foráneo de la línea ADO y un tráiler full, registrado sobre la autopista 150D México-Veracruz.\nEl percance ocurrió la mañana de este jueves, en el kilómetro 187+800, del tramo carretero Santa Cruz Ocotlán-El Libramiento a la Autopista Tehuacán- Cuacnopalan, con dirección al estado de Veracruz.\nEl siniestro provocó el cierre parcial de la circulación vehicular a la altura del municipio de Palmar de Bravo.\nDe acuerdo con los primeros informes, el accidente se registró debido a que el autobús de pasajeros, en el que viajaban 40 pasajeros, no guardó suficiente distancia, y chocó contra el trailer doble tolva.\nEl impacto de la unidad, dejó cinco personas heridas de gravedad, entre las que se encuentra un menor de edad y el conductor del autobús.\nAl sitio llegaron oficiales de la Policía Municipal y Estatal, Guardia Nacional división carreteras, paramédicos de la agrupación SUMA y Caminos y Puentes Federales (CAPUFE), quienes auxiliaron y trasladaron a 18 pasajeros lesionados a hospitales de la zona para su valoración y atención médica.\nEn tanto personal de grúas realizó el retiro de las unidades accidentadas para restablecer al cien por ciento la circulación vehicular de la vía rápida Puebla- Orizaba.",
