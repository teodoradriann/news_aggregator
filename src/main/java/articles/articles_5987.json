    "title": "31 Construction Workers Rescued After Being Trapped in a Complex Operation",
    "text": "Tunnel Collapse Rescue in Los Angeles A construction team in Los Angeles was successfully rescued after a partial tunnel collapse late Wednesday. The incident trapped 31 workers about 400 feet underground while they were involved in a significant $700 million project.\nMichael Chee, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sanitary District, reported that the collapse happened between boring machines and crew members working five miles into the tunnel.\nThe tunnel, primarily situated beneath public roads, is 18 feet wide and extends seven miles. It’s designed to transport treated wastewater from across Los Angeles County to the Pacific Ocean. Firefighters noted that workers had to navigate through 12 to 15 feet of fallen debris to escape, with some needing assistance to be pulled from the site.\nBefore the rescue effort, the Chief Engineer of the County Sanitary District described the situation as “stiff,” indicating high levels of danger. The tunnel collapse meant workers could only go back through the damaged section, which understandably caused a lot of fear.\nIn the midst of the rescue, video footage captured the moment when a member of the construction crew was lifted to safety. According to Ferrante, the crew was operating boring machines at the time, and the ground had shifted, leading to the collapse.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass shared an update on social media shortly before midnight, stating that all workers had been freed and expressing gratitude to the first responders for their swift actions, referring to them as “the true heroes of LA.”\nABC 7 reported that there was only one exit route from the tunnel, making the rescue operation particularly challenging and technical. Over 100 members of the Los Angeles Fire Department participated in the efforts to bring the crew to safety.",
