    "title": "Pourquoi lâ€™Ã©lection de Donald Trump va faire mal Ã  la voiture Ã©lectrique, mais pas Ã  Tesla ?",
    "text": "Sur le papier, lâ€™Ã©lection de Donald Trump est un trÃ¨s mauvais coup pour la voiture Ã©lectrique. Le rÃ©publicain a en effet prÃ©venu quâ€™il va supprimer un crÃ©dit dâ€™impÃ´t de 7500 dollars et lâ€™ensemble des dispositifs fiscaux favorables Ã ces vÃ©hicules verts. Une perspective qui a de quoi donner des sueurs froides Ã lâ€™ensemble des constructeurs automobiles. Tesla et Elon Musk restent pourtant Ã©tonnamment optimistes. Explications. Panique Ã la Bourse Ce jeudi 14 novembre, suite Ã la diffusion de ces informations, un vent de panique sâ€™est manifestÃ© chez les investisseurs. Les cours des actions de Rivian, Lucid, et mÃªme Tesla, ont tous trois lourdement chutÃ©. De fait, la plupart des constructeurs amÃ©ricains restent dÃ©pendants de ces aides financÃ©es de lâ€™Ã‰tat. Si ces mesures sont rÃ©ellement mises en place, il y a donc fort Ã parier que leurs ventes seront lourdement affectÃ©es. Mais dans ce climat dÃ©faitiste, lâ€™attitude de Tesla et de ses dirigeants a de quoi surprendre. En effet, Elon Musk [a Ã©normÃ©ment soutenu](https://www.presse-citron.net/elon-musk-va-devenir-ministre-de-ladministration-trump-et-ce-nest-pas-une-blague/) la candidature de Donald Trump, si bien que de nombreux observateurs se sont demandÃ© pourquoi le prÃ©sident Ã©lu prenait une dÃ©cision aussi dÃ©favorable pour son nouvel ami. Les assistants du patron de Tesla ont indiquÃ© que ces dÃ©cisions seront surtout dÃ©vastatrices pour la concurrence, tandis que lâ€™effet sera minime pour le constructeur. Elon Musk avait lui-mÃªme tenu le mÃªme discours en juillet dernier. Il anticipait ainsi : Â« Je pense que ce serait dÃ©vastateur pour nos rivaux et lÃ©gÃ¨rement pour Tesla.Mais Ã long terme, je pense que cela aidera probablement Tesla Â». Tesla sera-t-il vraiment Ã©pargnÃ© ? En clair, Tesla a pris de lâ€™avance sur son marchÃ© et la sociÃ©tÃ© est mÃªme en mesure de mener une guerre des prix qui fait mal aux nouveaux venus. Si bien que ces derniers nâ€™ont quâ€™une marge assez serrÃ©e qui sera directement impactÃ©e par la baisse des aides Ã lâ€™achat. Câ€™est Ã©galement lâ€™avis Dan Ives, analyste chez Wedbush. CitÃ© par Business Insider, ce dernier prÃ©dit : Bien que la perte du crÃ©dit d’impÃ´t pour les vÃ©hicules Ã©lectriques puisse Ã©galement nuire Ã la demande sur les marges aux Ã‰tats-Unis, cela permettra Ã Tesla de mieux repousser la concurrence de Detroit (oÃ¹ se situent les constructeurs historiques, Ndlr), car les prix, l’Ã©chelle et la portÃ©e sont dÃ©risoires par rapport au reste de l’industrie automobile une fois que le crÃ©dit d’impÃ´t pour les vÃ©hicules Ã©lectriques aura disparu. Tout le monde nâ€™est pas de cet avis. [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24296301/elon-musk-donald-trump-tesla-evs-climate-change-auto-industry-tariffs-decoder-podcast) estime par exemple, que les mesures fiscales que pourrait prendre Donald Trump ainsi que la hausse des tarifs douaniers pourraient causer un dÃ©sordre Ã©conomique et politique majeur qui impacterait durablement lâ€™industrie automobile dans son ensemble. Tesla nâ€™y Ã©chapperait donc pas. ğŸ“� Pour ne manquer aucune actualitÃ© de Presse-citron, suivez-nous sur [Google ActualitÃ©s]et",

    "title": "National Cancer Awareness Day highlights urgent need for early detection and prevention",
    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nObserved annually on November 7, National Cancer Awareness Day serves as a crucial reminder to highlight the growing burden of cancer in India. This day is dedicated to educating the public about the importance of early detection, prevention, and improving access to effective treatments. As cancer cases in India continue to rise at an alarming rate, the need for increased awareness and proactive health interventions has never been more urgent. Cancer is now the second-leading cause of death in India, with approximately 1.4 million new cases diagnosed each year. The disease claimed over 850,000 lives in 2023, and in the next decade, it is expected to overtake heart disease as the number one killer. Despite significant medical advances, late-stage diagnosis remains a primary factor contributing to high mortality rates, with nearly 50 to 70% of cancers diagnosed at advanced stages (III or IV).\nDr Hemant Malhotra (Oncologist) stated that tobacco and alcohol consumption contributes as two major components that cause cancer. He further stated that impact of air pollution and contaminated food and the food substances that have added chemicals might also be a few causes of cancer. He informed that the most common types of cancer in India include breast cancer, lung cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and stomach/oesophageal cancers. These five cancers account for more than half of the country’s cancer burden. Breast cancer is the leading cancer among women, while oral cancers — largely attributed to widespread tobacco chewing — have made India the global capital of head and neck cancers. Similarly, lung cancer and cervical cancer continue to pose significant challenges, especially with insufficient preventive measures and screening.\nGovernment initiatives and efforts to combat cancer\nIn response to the rising cancer burden, the Indian government has launched several initiatives to combat cancer through early detection, prevention, and treatment. Key programs include National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Stroke (NPCDCS). This program focuses on raising awareness, providing screening services, and promoting early diagnosis and treatment.\nThrough initiatives like Ayushman Bharat, the Indian government is working to enhance healthcare access across the country by establishing health and wellness centres that offer essential cancer screening services, particularly for breast, cervical, and oral cancers. These services aim to encourage early detection, which can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Additionally, India has introduced HPV vaccination programs to prevent cervical cancer, and the vaccine is gradually being incorporated into the national vaccination schedule, with a special focus on schoolchildren in rural areas, where access to healthcare services is often limited. Another vital component in India’s efforts to combat cancer is National Cancer Awareness Day, which plays a crucial role in raising public awareness about cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment options. This observance not only educates people about the importance of screenings and healthy lifestyle choices but also fosters greater community engagement in the fight against cancer.\nThe role of early detection and prevention\nEarly detection of cancers like breast, cervical, and oral cancers has the potential to reduce mortality rates significantly. Screening programs and public awareness campaigns are key tools in encouraging people to seek timely medical help. On National Cancer Awareness Day, free cancer screenings are offered at health centres across the country, and educational programs are held to inform people about the warning signs of cancer and the importance of healthy lifestyle choices.\nOn National Cancer Awareness Day, experts highlighted the importance of lifestyle changes in preventing cancer, stressing that the disease is not only about early diagnosis and treatment but also about reducing risk factors through healthier habits. Many cancers today are classified as lifestyle diseases, linked to habits such as smoking, unhealthy diets, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity. Adopting a cancer-preventive lifestyle, especially in young adulthood, could prevent up to 50% of cancers. Key preventive measures include tobacco control, as 28% of Indian adults use tobacco, contributing to high rates of oral cancers. Experts also recommend a healthy diet rich in fibre and antioxidants, combined with regular exercise, to reduce cancer risk. Additionally, vaccines like the HPV vaccine for cervical cancer and the Hepatitis B vaccine for liver cancer are crucial in preventing certain types of cancer. While India faces a rising cancer burden, sustained efforts in early detection, prevention, and awareness are critical in addressing the crisis.",

    "title": "“I’m tired of nonsense”: the rector of the University of Salamanca attacks ‘Nature’ for withdrawing his articles",
    "text": "The cloister of the University of Salamanca this Thursday was awaited with some expectation. The rector of the University of Salamanaca, Juan Manuel Corchado, was going to give explanations after the external report requested by the Research Ethics Committee concluded that Corchado had “an editorial network” and “a publication factory”, the publishing house Springer withdrew 75 articles in which Corchado had participated and the Governing Board of the Conference of Rectors (CRUE) sent a statement in which it rejected “any unethical conduct,” although it did not allude to expressly to Juan Manuel Corchado.\nOne thousand professors from 53 universities ask the minister to investigate cases of research malpractice\nHowever, the faculty has not followed the planned agenda and the vote has been brought forward. Nor has the session been broadcast live – as on other occasions –, not even the rector’s report despite the fact that it was planned to be this way, something that the rector has justified by the Data Protection Law.\nCorchado has assured that it does allow for a streaming within the university space. Right at the end of the faculty, the general secretary of the USAL, Alfredo Ávila de la Torre, has asked for “some caution” when talking about a lack of transparency because they consider that the faculty should be open, but only at the university level and not to the tourists or through YouTube.\n“Any tourist who visits this historic building cannot enter the cloister because they are not from the university community. We cannot make a leap in transparency and the tourist cannot enter the room and they can see it on YouTube. We have to establish a transparency control regime that is appropriate to what is needed,” said the general secretary of the USAL, who has encouraged work on a new public system that has “all the guarantees.”\nIt is not retransmitted to avoid “illegality”\n“We do not have the technology to broadcast this as the Law tells us. Yesterday we received several questions in this regard, we asked Legal Services and the board has decided that, in order not to incur in illegality,” said Corchado, who has refused to assess whether, when the cloister has been broadcast on previous occasions, He had broken some law. The spokesman for the Government of Castilla y León, Carlos Fernández Carriedo, has highlighted that the USAL is “very important” and has referred to “university autonomy”.\nSome of the professors critical of Corchado’s work have also wanted to know exactly the rector’s organizational chart; not only its vice-rectors, but also the rector’s delegates, managers, commissioners and service directors.\nThe rector of the USAL has assured that the supplements received are “a pittance” for the responsibility they entail and has ruled out that they influence the Budget, whose personnel expenses chapter will exceed the budget limit by three million euros, according to calculated Corchado.\nThe head of the University of Salamanca has opted to have teams that can respond to daily work and also plan the future of the university. However, it has not provided data on how many staff it is requiring or the remuneration it charges, although this will be done “when there is a possibility” because it wants to publish it in an “orderly” manner and not “putting patches.” Corchado took office at the end of May.\n“We have asked for a list, searched in law eb or in news that we are finding out about the appointments, but we want something complete with names, reductions in hours and remuneration,” claimed Susana Pérez.\n‘Nature’, the CRUE and other societies have gone “with a story”\nThe rector of the USAL has criticized that the CRUE did not consult him or “many” rectors “friends” of his before that statement, just as the publisher of the journal Nature and other scientific societies, which he He has left “with a story” and that, he points out, they have issued opinions “without knowing the subject.”\nOn occasion, Corchado’s story has been contradictory: first he said that the editors had not “contacted” him and then clarified shortly afterwards: “In Nature They write to me on a Friday afternoon, I spend the weekend explaining and they don’t even read it,” criticized the rector of the University of Salamanca, who ‘understands’ the “pressures” that Springer may have received.\nThe rector of USAL has stressed that he is “calm” because he has dedicated his life “to public service” despite the “media campaign” with “spurious purposes” and threats—even death—that he has suffered. This is how Juan Manuel Corchado has expressed himself before the highest representative body of the University Community, which has experienced a moment of tension after some members critical of him have intervened.\n“Sick of putting up with nonsense”\n“Whoever wants to take this out of context, let them do so. “I’m tired of putting up with this and listening to nonsense,” protested Corchado, who insisted on reducing the importance of the latest events. Regarding the deletion of pieces uploaded to the USAL institutional repository (GREDOS), Corchado has assured that he is “the biggest defender” of this repository and that, especially in the pandemic, he asked his team to upload “everything that could” (books, articles, presentations, etc.) to the repository because “it had almost no impact.”\nGiven his possible presentation to the position of rector, Corchado—according to his story—gave instructions to remove the 200 items. “Without further ado, I picked up the phone and told them: ‘remove them because they are no longer useful.’ And there is nothing more to say,” he concluded.\nWhen asked about Corchado’s affiliations with the universities of Osaka or Malaysia, the rector asked about the authority of Susana Pérez—a professor in the Department of Applied Physics who considered running against Corchado in the elections—because she has “few articles” in your career and sign the articles “always in the middle”. “It is very easy to criticize and focus on those things that others criticize in newspapers,” reproached Corchado, who has assured that from now on he will not speak to any journalist about his self-citation scandal.\n“Whoever wants something, see you in court. And whoever doesn’t want it, maybe we’ll see each other in court,” said Corchado, who assured that after ordering the deletion of his articles in the GREDOS system he received calls from “four or five journalists.” “And one of them, who is still there talking about me, insisted. He told me: ‘Tell me what you want and I’ll say what I want.’\nCorchado’s intervention concluded with applause from the faculty after the rector stated that he has his head “very high” for his “prestige” and criticized those who try to “take from where there is none.” Some of the critical representatives of the faculty have asked Corchado for “due respect” after the rector has addressed some of the faculty members and has alluded to their number of publications. A minor applause began the end of the lecture that took place in the Auditorium of the University of Salamanca.\n#tired #nonsense #rector #University #Salamanca #attacks #Nature #withdrawing #articles",

    "title": "Microsoft Lays Off Around 650 Employees from Xbox Gaming Unit",
    "text": "Microsoft announced this Thursday that it will cut off around 650 roles from its Xbox gaming division. According to CNBC , the CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Phil Spencer, sent a memo to employees informing them about the decision this week. “We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted,” said Spencer in the document CNBC verified. According to the information shared by the CEO, most of the roles being cut out are from supporting and corporate positions. It was also clarified that no devices, games, studios, or gaming experiences would be affected by this change. In previous layoffs, studios have been affected, but not this time. This would be the third round of layoffs since the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in October last year. This new cut was focused on reducing redundancies, aligning the new merged team, and focusing on long-term goals. “In the US, we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the US packages will differ according to location,” said Spencer. According to the BBC, this new layoff represents 3% of the gaming staff. Spencer mentioned that he knew it would be “difficult” for many workers and acknowledged and thanked their contribution to Xbox. After the pandemic, the gaming industry has faced multiple layoffs including companies like Sony’s Playstation. However, while Xbox device sales have fallen, according to recent reports, Microsoft has mentioned that gaming revenues have increased, especially after the purchase of Activision-Blizzard—which produces popular games like Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Diablo. A few months ago, Microsoft also announced higher prices for its Xbox Game Pass subscription services. Other tech companies also announced layoffs this week. Bending Spoons announced on Monday that it will cut 75% of WeTransfer’s staff .",
