    "text": "28 Dec 2023 | 09:46 PM UTC Belgium: Taxi drivers serving Brussels Airport will strike on Dec. 29 Taxi drivers serving Brussels Airport in Brussels, Belgium, will strike on Dec. 29 to denounce government's proposed language policy. Unionized taxi drivers serving Brussels Airport (BRU) in Brussels will strike on Dec. 29 to denounce the Flemish government's proposal requiring drivers to pass a mandatory Dutch language exam starting July 2024. Strike organizers assert that this move will cause more than 75 percent of the airport taxi operators to lose their jobs. While organizers did not provide an exact start time for the labor action, they stated that the strike would last 2.5 hours. The labor action will likely prompt delays in travel to and from BRU. Overcrowding on available modes of airport transportation, including ride-share service, is possible during the work stoppage. Although organizers did not provide information on any associated protest, striking workers may form picket lines near BRU, prompting localized transport disruptions. Confirm airport transportation in advance if scheduled to travel via BRU on Dec. 29. Avoid any protest that materializes.",

    "text": "The UK Government has announced the first successful trial of laser\ntechnology against air targets, which could “strengthen the UK’s armed forces with greater precision while reducing reliance on expensive munitions”.\nSource: message\nBritish governmentquotes “ European truth“\nDetails: The DragonFire Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) system has fired a powerful laser weapon at aerial targets for the first time in the UK at a training ground in Scotland.\nThe government said the range of the DragonFire weapon is classified, but it is a “line-of-sight weapon and can strike any visible target.” They called it “an advanced military laser of the future.”\nThe British government added that the laser weapon “can boast pinpoint accuracy” equivalent to hitting a £1 coin from a distance of 1,000 metres.\nLiterally: “Directed laser energy weapons can engage targets at the speed of light and use an intense beam of light to cut through the target, resulting in structural failure or more dramatic results if the warhead hits the target.\nA 10 second shot costs the equivalent of using a conventional heater for an hour. It therefore has the potential to become a long-term, low-cost alternative to certain tasks that rockets currently perform. The cost of operating a laser is typically less than £10 per shot.”\nDetails: The UK’s DragonFire program is led by the Defense Science and\nTechnology Laboratory (Dstl) on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence, working with its industrial partners MBDA, Leonardo and QinetiQ.\n“This type of advanced weaponry has the potential to revolutionize the battlefield by reducing reliance on expensive ammunition, as well as reducing the risk of collateral casualties,” Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said.\nDSTL chief executive Paul Hollinshead said: “These tests have allowed us to take a huge step forward in realizing the potential and understanding of the threats posed by directed energy weapons. With our decades of knowledge, skills and operational experience, DSTL’s expertise is critical to helping armed forces in preparation for the future.”\nDragonFire laser system from the British Defense Science and\nTechnology Laboratory (Dstl)\nUK government\nThe DragonFire weapon is the result of a £100 million joint investment between the Ministry of Defense and industry.\nContext: Nations around the\nworld are in a race to develop laser weapons powerful enough to melt steel. China announced in August 2023 that it had found a way to create laser weapons that can fire indefinitely. If true, it would give the country a lead in technology development.\nIn December, the U.S. Air Force and Navy asked Raytheon to design, build and test systems that would ignite enemy electronic components using energy blasts.\nBefore this, US President Joe Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act, which provides a record 886 billion for defense needs in the 2024 fiscal year.\n2024-01-19 13:06:40\n#British #tested #laser #weapons #air #targets #DragonFire #hits #coin",

    "title": "CP NewsAlert: Union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers ends unlimited strike",
    "text": "MONTREAL — A union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers has reached a deal in principle with the government and is ending a strike that has shut around 800 schools since Nov. 23. Fédération autonome de l’enseignement — or FAE — said Thursday night on social media that it spent the day analyzing a tentative deal with the province and will recommend it to its members for approval during general assemblies after the holidays. Details of the agreement have not been released. Even though the FAE called the deal \"a new step,\" it emphasized \"it is up to the teachers to respond to (Premier) François Legault's government and to say whether they feel they have been heard.\" The union said it has ended all of its pressure tactics, such as the general strike that has shut 800 schools, including in Montreal, since the end of November. If students affected by the FAE strike return to school as scheduled in January, they will have been away from classes for almost seven consecutive weeks. The FAE, which represents more than 66,000 teachers, took the most hard line out of all the public sector unions negotiating new contracts with the government when it launched an unlimited general strike. Earlier today, the government announced it had reached tentative deals on salaries with an alliance of unions, excluding the FAE, representing 420,000 public sector employees, including teachers and health-care workers. They had walked out sporadically since November, for a total of 11 days. The only major labour group without any sort of agreement is a nurses union with about 80,000 members — Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec — which said today that negotiations are ongoing. Earlier Thursday, before the FAE announced the end to its strike, Sylvain Martel, spokesman for parents group Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec, said he was feeling optimistic but remaining cautious that 800 schools would reopen after the holiday break. \"We're glad that we're able to hope for going back to school on Jan. 9, but everything is tentative, lots of people have to agree to what's on the table, so let's hope that it's a real deal and (union) members will get what they want,\" he said in an interview. Martel said discussions have been taking place between teachers, parents and administrators about how children will catch up after missing so much school. How that happens will vary, he said, because the effects of the strikes were unequal — some parents taught their children at home, others hired tutors, but many less-fortunate students spent weeks with little to no learning at all. \"It's very difficult for students to go back to the same rhythm they were in November, so it's going to take a little while, but we'll get there,\" he said.

    "text": "US billionaire Elon Musk, owner of social media platform X, has condemned Australia's proposed law to ban social media access for children under 16, calling it \\\"a backdoor way to control access to the internet by all Australians.\\\"The remarks came in response to Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's announcement of the bill on X late Thursday.Australia's center-left government introduced the bill in parliament, outlining plans for an age-verification system to enforce one of the strictest social media regulations globally. Companies found in systemic breach of the proposed law could face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). The bill aims to curb social media use by children without exceptions for parental consent or pre-existing accounts. \\\"This legislation sends a strong message about protecting the safety and well-being of our children online,\\\" the government stated. Several countries have introduced or proposed similar measures to restrict social media access for minors. France, for example, suggested a ban for those under 15 last year but allowed parental consent, while US law has long required tech companies to seek parental consent to access data of children under 13. Musk’s comments add to his history of clashes with Australia's Labor government over social media policies.In April, X challenged an Australian cyber regulator's order to remove posts about a stabbing incident, leading Albanese to label Musk an \\\"arrogant billionaire.\\\" Musk had also previously criticised the government’s misinformation law, describing its approach as \\\"fascist.\\\"",
