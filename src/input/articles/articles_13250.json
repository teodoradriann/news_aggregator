    "text": "Saturday - last edited Saturday\nHi, I'm having some issues with the Chromecast Built-in functionality on my Bravia TV.\nRecent versions have had seriously out of sync audio so I had to downgrade it to the earliest version my TV came with (1.56.292394)\nMy confusion is that, according to this support page - https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7124014?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccurrent-production-firmware-vers... - the current version is also 1.56.292394. Meanwhile my TV says the current version (and the one it wants to update to) is the much later 3.72.435199.\nWhat is going on?\n31m ago\nHey there!\nThanks for posting in the community. I'm sorry about the inconveniences that you’ve been experiencing with your Bravia TV with Chromecast Built-in. I understand that there is an issue with the audio syncing on Bravia TV. For more help, it is important to contact the manufacturer because they have the correct troubleshooting based on the hardware and software they build.\nIf you still need help, you can continue posting.\nRegards,\nDerick.",

    "title": "Supreme Court limits SEC's powers to impose fines | KPBS Public Media",
    "text": "Supreme Court limits SEC's powers to impose fines The U.S. Supreme Court, heading into the final stretch of the term, issued a raft of new and consequential decisions Thursday, on everything from opioids to ozone pollution. In the space of less than a half hour Thursday morning, the high court [invalidated a multi-billion dollar opioid settlement](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/nx-s1-4986029/purdue-scotus-sackler-bankruptcy-oxycontin); it put a [hold on an important EPA rule](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/27/nx-s1-4996428/supreme-court-good-neighbor-plan) aimed at reducing ozone pollution; [it temporarily allowed emergency abortions](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/13/nx-s1-5005422/supreme-court-emtala) in Idaho in cases where the woman’s health, but not her life, is in grave jeopardy; and finally, the conservative supermajority continued its march to curtail agency power, ruling that Congress exceeded its power when it authorized the Securities and Exchange Commission to impose fines on financial wrongdoers. The SEC decision stripped the agency of its major method of penalizing those found to have committed fraud in the securities industry. Congress specifically strengthened the law in 2010 by authorizing the agency to use independent administrative law judges to conduct hearings, to make factual findings, and to impose fines on those accused of securities fraud. But writing for the court’s conservative supermajority on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts said that system violates the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. Although he acknowledged that under the current system the accused do have the right to appeal in federal court, Roberts said that is not the same thing as having the right to be tried by a jury of one’s peers in a courtroom supervised by a federal judge. In a rare oral dissent from the bench, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the majority of “judicial aggrandizement” and blowing up the so-called public rights doctrine. Under that doctrine, she observed, the court has, for more than a century, permitted agencies, when authorized by Congress, to impose monetary penalties on those who have defrauded the government. “Make no mistake,” she said. \"Today’s decision is a power grab. Once again the majority arrogates Congress’s policymaking role to itself,” And in so doing, she said, the court had cast a cloud of doubt over the way dozens of agencies carry out their congressional mandates. Congress, she said, “had no reason to anticipate the chaos today’s majority would unleash after all these years.” Indeed, the court’s decision could have huge ripple effects for agencies that use a process like the SEC’s to enforce laws on everything from labor rights to mine safety and energy regulation. But as Case Western University professor Jonathan Adler observes, the court majority did carve out an exception for agencies that deal with federal benefits. “The court doesn’t touch Congress’ ability to allow agency adjudication for public benefits and pensions and patents and things like that,” he said. Indeed, the court’s decision leaves in tact the Social Security Administration’s cadre of 1,500 administrative law judges who make decision in a half million cases every year. The SEC case was brought by George Jarkesy, a former conservative radio talk show host and hedge fund manager, who was supported in the case by a who’s who of conservative and business groups, plus some individuals like Elon Musk, who has repeatedly resisted the SEC’s attempts to probe whether he illegally manipulated his company’s stock. Jarkesy was investigated for fraud, and after a hearing before an administrative law judge, he was fined $300,000 and ordered to pay back $700,000 in ill-gotten gains; in addition, the agency barred him from various activities in the securities industry. Thursday’s Supreme Court decision did not touch the $700,000 in restitution, just the fine. George Washington University law professor Alan Morrison says the court seems to be drawing a line between a fine—a penalty-- which is not permissible, and restitution, which is permissible. That, he notes may be a saving grace for the agency. “An agency like the SEC may say, look, disgorgement is a lot of money and we’ll be happy to get disgorgement at the administrative level,” he said. Ironically, after today’s ruling, the SEC is likely to suffer fewer consequences than other agencies, largely because the Supreme Court, beginning in 2018, began eating away at the agency’s power to use administrative law judges, and in response, the SEC decreased the number of ALJ’s at the agency from 6 to 2, choosing instead to bring its cases mainly in federal court. Yet, even for the SEC, the impact of Thursday’s ruling is significant. “There will be a permanent change in how the SEC will be using its administrative courts,\" said Richard Hong, who spent seventeen years as an SEC trial attorney. \"It has been increasingly moribund in the past few years, and now you can officially call it dead for fraud cases seeking penalties.” Copyright 2024 NPR",

    "text": "Flight, train services disrupted as dense fog engulfs Delhi-NCR\nUpdated: Jan 3rd, 2025\nDense fog enveloped various parts of Delhi-NCR, bringing visibility down and thereby impacting train and flight operations.\nAt least 24 trains departing from Delhi were delayed due to weather-related conditions. Among the affected trains, the Ayodhya Express was delayed by four hours, the Gorakhdham Express was running more than two hours late, and the Bihar Kranti Express and the Shram Shakti Express were delayed by over three hours.\nMany airlines' flights were also affected, even though the Delhi airport reported an average delay of five minutes for arrival flights and 11 minutes for departure flights, as per live flight tracker.\nWhile SpiceJet said all flights coming in and going to Amritsar and Guwahati are affected due to bad weather, IndiGo issued a travel advisory with special focus on the Delhi, Amritsar, Lucknow, Bengaluru and Guwahati routes.\nVarious airlines urged travellers to check flight schedules while planning their journey, warning that flights might be cancelled if the visibility remains poor.\nAs per the past 24-hour data of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi is expected to witness fog till January 8, with light rain likely on January 6. The Delhi-NCR woke up to a thick blanket of fog on Friday, with temperatures dropping to a minimum of 8 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the national capital’s air quality deteriorated further, recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 318 in the “very poor” category, as the Central Pollution Control Board resumed data updates after a day-long pause. The maximum and minimum temperatures are forecasted to be 17 degrees Celsius and 8 degrees Celsius, respectively.\nVisibility conditions worsened significantly at 6 a.m., leading authorities to take action to ensure safety. Flights that lack the necessary equipment for low-visibility landings, especially those not adhering to CAT III standards, are expected to experience delays or cancellations.\nThe Safdarjung weather station considered the benchmark for Delhi’s climate, recorded a maximum temperature of 16.2 degrees Celsius earlier on Thursday, slightly up from 15 degrees Celsius the previous day but still three degrees below the normal mark.\nAccording to the IMD, “cold day” conditions are declared when the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more below normal, provided the minimum temperature is below 10 degrees. While Safdarjung didn’t meet the criteria, the Palam, Najafgarh, Pusa, and Narela weather stations reported “cold day” conditions.\nRelief, however, appears to be on the horizon as the IMD predicts a slight increase in temperatures over the coming days due to the influence of a fresh western disturbance. The maximum temperature in Delhi is expected to hover around 17 degrees on Friday and rise to 18 degrees Celsius by Saturday. “A marginal increase of about one degree in maximum temperatures is anticipated across most parts of the region,” an IMD official noted.\n(This story was taken from syndicated feed and was only edited for style by Gujarat Samachar Digital team)",

Hussain and Syed Ahmad recently wrote a letter to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, requesting him to allow Muslim employees to perform prayers and break their fast by giving them one-hour exemption from duty.\nThe Karnataka government has yet to make a decision on the matter.\nThe demand was raised following similar announcements by the governments of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, which allowed Muslim employees to leave work early during the fasting month of Ramzan.\nPramod Muthalik, Chief of Sri Rama Sena, strongly opposed the request on Friday, stating, \"The Constitution, drafted by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, grants equal freedom for the practice of all religions. India is a secular nation. However, making special arrangements for government employees of a particular religion is incorrect and condemnable. It would be wrong if the Karnataka government approves this demand.\n“Will the government consider such special arrangements when Hindus observe fasts during Shivratri, Ekadashi, and other festivals?\n“Today, they are asking for a one-hour exemption during Ramzan; tomorrow, they may demand exemptions from duty every Friday for prayers.\"\n“These demands should not be entertained by the government. If it is permitted, Hindus will be compelled to stage protests,” Muthalik warned.\nHe pointed out that if the Hindu community began demanding exemptions during their religious festivals, government offices would remain empty, as Hindus celebrate festivals frequently.\nSignificantly, the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah-led Karnataka government has yet to make a decision on the matter.\nIn their letter to CM Siddaramaiah, the Congress leaders stated, \"With the month of Ramzan approaching, the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments have allowed Muslim employees to leave work early, considering the fact that they will be fasting. We request you to consider a similar exemption in Karnataka.\"\nM.R.M. Hussain further stated that allowing Muslim employees to leave early during Ramzan would be a considerate gesture without any ulterior motive.\n\"It will send a good message if granted, but if not, there is no issue. The final decision rests with the Chief Minister, and this matter should not turn into a controversy,\" he said.\nHe also questioned why the BJP, which is expected to oppose the move, has remained silent on the NDA-led Andhra Pradesh government's decision to allow Muslim employees to leave work early.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",

    "text": "By Chris Piner ,\n5 hours ago When it comes to love, every person knows the pain of heartbreak. The decision to end a relationship can be a daunting task when the people involved share a love for several years. But thanks to the internet, countless people shared their stories of heartbreak and how some lovers decided to end it without directly speaking to the other person. And even though Andrew Millsaps continues to carve out his spot in country music, he recently recalled how his fiancée decided to call it quits just as he was about to take the stage.\nAppearing on Taste of Country Nights , Millsaps opened up about his past relationships. Although part of Neon Union with Leo Brooks, the rising star put his time on stage on hold as he recalled his heartbreak. The entire ordeal happened when he was in Baltimore. Going through a soundcheck, Millsaps received a message on his phone. At the time he was engaged to his fiancée after being together for nearly five years. But even with years of love and an engagement ring, nothing prepared him for what came next.\nAfter learning via text message that his future wife was leaving him, Millsaps took some time to himself to ponder the words. According to the singer, his ex-fiancée struggled with homesickness and wanted to go back to North Carolina. While understanding her motivation, Millsaps continued forward with his music career. With the singer not ready to step off the stage, his fiancée decided to call it quits.\nAlthough having a broken heart, Millsaps promised Taste of Country Nights that it didn’t stop Neon Union from taking the stage and putting on a stellar performance. But for the singer, the entire concert came with a great deal of heartache.\nAndrew Millsaps Ready To Release Debut Album With Neon Union As for the future, Neon Union prepared to release their debut album, Good Years , on Friday, January 31. Having released songs like “Bout Damn Time”, the duo also opened for stars like HARDY, Pitbull, and even Scotty McCreery.\nOver the last several weeks, Neon Union dropped the names of songs on their new album, which included titles like “Helluva High”, “This Side of the Dirt”, and “Luck Don’t Live Around Here.” Don’t miss Good Year, which will hit shelves on Friday.\n(Photo by Ayisha Collins/Getty Images)\n79",

    "text": "Juros: A decisão do Copom deixa margem à confusão, incerteza e volatilidade Chuva no RS: safra da maçã já foi quase totalmente colhida, e desafio é a logística A Lei das Estatais é de 2016, foi uma proposta do governo Michel Temer exatamente para blindar as empresas públicas do excesso de intervenção política que houve ao longo dos tempos e que vinha se agravando e provocado muitos casos de corrupção. É uma forma de blindar a interferência política. Blinda totalmente? Não, mas protege, criando regras claras de transparência.\nUma das regras estabelece, por exemplo, que quem participou de uma estrutura partidária ou fez o programa de governo, campanha eleitoral está vetado para ser nomeado em cargo em estatais, conselhos de administração ou direção executiva. O governo Lula conseguiu eliminar essa trava com um liminar concedida pelo atual ministro da Justiça, Ricardo Lewandowski , quando ele ainda estava no Supremo. O ministro, agora aposentado do STF, concedeu à época uma liminar que considerava a Lei das Estatais inconstitucional . O voto de Lewandowski foi derrotado nesta quinta-feira.\nO grande pacote de ajuda ao Rio Grande do Sul é para reconstruir o estado: Medidas anunciadas nesta manhã oferecem alternativas para vários segmentos Em 6 dias de operação no Rio Grande do Sul, Bradesco Seguros recebe pedidos de indenização que ultrapassam R$ 100 milhões\nNo entanto, mais de 50 pessoas foram nomeadas pelo governo Lula tendo base nessa liminar. Para que eles permaneçam nos cargos foi negociado um acordo que mantém os indicados durante os 14 meses de validade da liminar. Essa solução para não criar instabilidade em quem já está nomeado, foi uma forma de resolver o problema imediato, mas daqui pra diante o governo Lula, nem qualquer outro governo, vai poder desrespeitar essa regra.\nJean Paul Prates , por exemplo, que pela lei não poderia ocupar o cargo de presidente da Petrobras , vai permanecer no cargo. O mesmo vale para o ex-ministro Aloízio Mercadante que se manterá na presidência do BNDES . Na época dessa discussão, conversei com o Mercadante e ele acha que não se enquadra na restrição imposta pela Lei das Estatais, porque não fez parte da estrutura de campanha, nem do comando do PT. Antes de ser nomeado para o banco de fomento, Mercadante estava na Fundação Perseu Abramo. O ex-ministro, no entanto, coordenou a elaboração do programa de Lula.\nMais recente Próxima O dado preocupante sobre o comércio do Rio Grande do Sul Alexandre de Moraes Aloizio Mercadante André Mendonça BNDES Cármen Lúcia Dias Toffoli Edson Fachin Flávio Dino Gilmar Mendes Jean Paul Prates Kassio Nunes Marques Luiz Fux Luís Roberto Barroso Petrobras Ricardo Lewandowski STF",
