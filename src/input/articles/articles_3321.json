    "text": "You’ve heard about the Barbie movie– even if you live under a rock. The Greta Gerwig film took over the world, resonating with millions. Many women saw their careers and personal lives reflected in Barbie’s ( [Margot Robbie](https://insidethemagic.net/2024/01/margot-robbie-wants-other-actresses-to-take-over-as-the-dcus-harley-quinn-aml1/)) heartbreak as Ken ( [Ryan Gosling](https://insidethemagic.net/2022/07/ryan-gosling-ghost-rider-rumors-al1/comments/)) took over Barbie Land. Others were reminded of their teenage years watching Gloria (America Ferrera) and Sasha ( [Ariana Greenblatt](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/09/young-ahsoka-casting-confirmed-rosario-dawsons-replacement-makes-triumphant-debut-aml1/)) navigated their complicated mother-daughter relationship. Making more than $1.4 billion at the box office, Barbie (2023) is the 14th highest-grossing film ever. It’s hard to go anywhere without seeing an “I’m Kenough” t-shirt or bright pink, Mattel-branded regalia. Whether they remember welling up at Billie Elish’s “What Was I Made For?” or laughed as Gosling and [Simu Liu](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/11/marvel-actor-simu-liu-quits-disney-world-cj1/) battled through “I’m Just Ken,” Barbie impacted viewers. Still, every successful film has its critics, and Barbie World isn’t immune. While there was the expected [misogynistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J7aJtGphVs&ab_channel=TheCriticalDrinker) backlash, some feminists felt the Warner Bros. Pictures movie didn’t go far enough. Some criticized the juxtaposition of anti-patriarchal themes in a movie based on a plastic toy, often children’s first introduction to American [consumerism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/07/19/barbie-icon-consumption/). But much of the feminist critique revolved around Gloria’s viral monologue, which empowers Stereotypical Barbie to take back Barbie Land. “I think one of the reasons this scene didn’t resonate with me is that this surface level feminism like. This is what you come to understand when you turn 12,” [said](https://x.com/k1ndbutnotsoft/status/1722617270265155894?s=20) x (formerly known as Twitter) user @k1ndbutnotsoft. “Also I guess it just feels like white feminism bc there’s no intersectionality.” I think one of the reasons this scene didn’t resonate with me is that this surface level feminism like. this is what you come to understand when you turn 12. also I guess it just feels like white feminism bc there’s no intersectionality [https://t.co/1T2H17wTZ1] — joci ⋆.ೃ࿔*:･ (@k1ndbutnotsoft) [November 9, 2023] “The problem with Barbie isn’t that it’s feminism 101, it’s BAD feminism 101 for white collar city folk and the little girls who aspire to work in a cubicle, but like, a cubicle the same size as all the men have, I guess,” @jentalksmovies [wrote](https://x.com/jentalksmovies/status/1742686586129498583?s=20). The problem with Barbie isn’t that it’s feminism 101, it’s BAD feminism 101 for white collar city folk and the little girls who aspire to work in a cubicle, but like, a cubicle the same size as all the men have, I guess — Jennings (@jentalksmovies) [January 3, 2024] In a recent interview with [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/movies/america-ferrera-barbie.html), Ferrera defended her character’s speech. “We can know things and still need to hear them out loud. It can still be a cathartic,” the actress argued. “There are a lot of people who need Feminism 101, whole generations of girls who are just coming up now and who don’t have words for the culture that they’re being raised in. Also, boys and men who may have never spent any time thinking about feminist theory. If you are well-versed in feminism, then it might seem like an oversimplification, but there are entire countries that banned this film for a reason.” “To say that something that is maybe foundational, or, in some people’s view, basic feminism isn’t needed is an oversimplification,” Ferrera continued. “Assuming that everybody is on the same level of knowing and understanding the experience of womanhood is an oversimplification.” Did Barbie live up to your expectations for the movie?

    "text": "VICTORIA — A new report has found that the number of young offenders in British Columbia has \"dramatically decreased,\" putting the ratio of staff to youth in custody at almost 11-to-one. The report from Jennifer Charlesworth, B.C.'s representative for children and youth, says the numbers highlight \"a golden opportunity\" for government to better reallocate justice-related resources to the people who need them. Charlesworth says the report is not intended to recommend cuts to provincial spending on the youth justice system, but rather the creation of new guidelines to redistribute resources to avoid waste. Charlesworth says items worth reconsidering include the pending closure this year of the Youth Custody Centre in Prince George, B.C., which would force young offenders in the northern part of the province to be placed far from their communities. She says the province should look at retaining a six-bed temporary detention facility in Prince George, and that more engagement with groups such as the First Nations Justice Council and local communities should take place to decide how to use the resources. The report says the average daily number of youth in custody in B.C. has fallen from 386 in 1997/1998 to as low as 11 in 2021/2022. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024. The Canadian Press",

    "text": "A redução dos atuais 6.014 trabalhadores para 5.807 deverá passar por um plano de reformas antecipadas e pré-reformas, visto que 1.838 funcionários da Santa Casa têm 55 anos ou mais. Um dos objetivos do plano de reestruturação que o novo provedor da Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa (SCML), Paulo de Sousa, entregou em julho ao Governo é a redução da despesa com recursos humanos, apontando para uma diminuição dos atuais 6.014 trabalhadores para 5.807, menos 207, noticia o Público . A dispensa de funcionários deverá passar por um plano de reformas antecipadas e pré-reformas, já que 235 trabalhadores têm 65 ou mais anos e 1.603 têm entre 60 e 64 anos. Dados oficiais indicam que a despesa com pessoal da Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa foi de 152 milhões de euros em 2023 e a estimativa para este ano era que superasse os 162,6 milhões de euros. Simultaneamente, o Plano de Atividades e Orçamento de 2024 da SCML referia como “o peso das despesas com pessoal, que em 2022 representaram 63% das receitas totais, devido a uma estrutura de grande dimensão, excessivos níveis hierárquicos e inúmeros cargos de chefia, limita fortemente os recursos a afetar a atividades e missão estatutária“. Segundo o plano de reestruturação, a nova mesa da instituição tem a ambição de atingir um resultado líquido positivo de cerca de 38,4 milhões de euros já no próximo ano, depois de a SCML ter chegado ao fim de 2023 com lucros de apenas 2,4 milhões de euros e menos 2% de receitas provenientes dos jogos sociais, para 191,10 milhões de euros. Por isso, o objetivo de Paulo de Sousa passa também por aumentar a receita corrente, estimada este ano em 289,5 milhões de euros, apesar das previsões de subida também da despesa corrente, de forma menos expressiva.

    "text": "Nirmala Carvalho\n(ZENIT News –\nAsia News / Thrissur, 05.31.2024).- Archbishop Mar Andrews Thazhath ordained Deacon Joseph Thermadom, who is deaf and speech-impaired, a priest of the Congregation of the Holy Cross in Thrissur (Kerala).\nAccording to Indian sources, Fr Thermadom, 38, is the first Indian with this disability to join the country’s Catholic clergy, the second in Asia, and the 26th in the world. The ordination ceremony took place last Thursday in the Basilica of Our Lady of Sorrows.\nThe new priest leads the liturgy by praying in sign language. “My vocation and mission as a priest are to provide all the Sacraments in the Indian Sign Language to all deaf Catholics in India. I also support God calling deaf people to the priesthood and religious life.”\nFor the new clergyman, “everyone should remember the positive view in the Bible about deaf people.” As Leviticus (19:14) says: “You shall not insult the deaf, or put a stumbling block in front of the blind, but you shall fear your God”.\nIn India some 60 million people have some form of speech and hearing impairments.\nBorn deaf and speech-impaired, Fr Thermadom is the son of Thomas and Rosy. Together with his brother, who is also hearing impaired, he studied in Mumbai where he obtained a BSc before embracing the religious life.\nHe pursued his religious training with the Dominican Missionaries for the Deaf Apostolate in the United States before returning to India where he met the Fathers of the Holy Cross through their ministry to the deaf.\nAfter expressing the desire to join their ministry, he was welcomed into the Aymanam community in 2017.\nHe made his first profession in 2020 at the Novitiate of the Holy Cross in Yercaud, Tamil Nadu, and by August he became the first deaf person to make his final profession in the congregation.\nThank you for reading our content.
