    "text": "Ye Says Fans Who Call Kendrick Lamar One of Their Favorite Rappers 'Don't Know About Rap'\nThe disgraced rapper also expressed his hatred for J. Cole's music in his latest rant.\nYe, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, continues to go out sad, seemingly fishing for a response from Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole by publicly criticizing their music.\nIn his latest attention-seeking attempt, Ye questioned why Drake has collaborated with Cole before stating people should not tell him that they are a fan of the Fayetteville rapper's music. \"I hate J. Cole,\" he said. \"It can't even be called music. I hate J. Cole.\"\nYe then turned his attention to the Compton native who appeared on The Life of Pablo track \"No More Parties in LA.\"\n\"And it's something about both J. Cole and Kendrick that kinda, that leaves me sorta like—it reminds me of each other and shit like that,\" he said alongside Toronto artist Top5. \"It's just not that sauce to me.\"\nYe also took issue with Ben Affleck putting Kendrick on his Mount Rushmore of rappers on Complex's GOAT Talk with Jon Bernthal.\n\"Anybody that say Kendrick is one of their favorite rappers, don't know about rap, doesn't know about real rap,\" Ye said.\nThis is far from the first time that Kendrick has been caught in the 47-year-old rapper's crosshairs. Ye called Lamar and Tyler, the Creator the \"two most overrated so-called artist\" last week, claiming the former \"cannot rap\" and \"doesn’t have one bar where I say I wish I said that.\"\nPrior to that, Ye, who was dressed in black Ku Klux Klan-style attire, told Akademiks that Kendrick has \"no hits.\"\nThe artist formerly known as Kanye West has expressed his hatred for Cole's music in the past as well.",

    "text": "Did you know the camellia is Alabama’s official State Flower? And did you know that the Dothan Area Botanical Garden has over 80 different camellias in its Camellia Garden? And finally, did you know that Dothan was once well-known in the world of camellia enthusiasts? In celebration of Camellia Day in Alabama, DABG is hosting several workshops on Saturday, Jan. 13, to introduce you to what some refer to as the “Winter Rose” due to its blooming season during winter months. The morning workshop will be led by local camellia expert Dr. Max McKinney who will cover all the basics of growing camellias in his presentation “Getting Started with Camellias”. McKinney tends over 1,700 camellias and has over 1,000 varieties on his farm near Webb. He is frequently asked to judge camellia shows and is considered a true authority on this wonderful plant. Another morning workshop will be a demonstration on waxing camellias. Waxing is an excellent way to preserve camellia blooms and gives them a porcelain-like shine that lasts for many days, and sometimes weeks. Once waxed, they do not need a vase or water—they can simply be displayed on a plate or by themselves on a table. Participants are welcome to bring a bloom of their own to wax or select from the blooms provided. People are also reading… After lunch, Forrest Latta from Mobile will present an interesting talk called “Dothan’s Rich Camellia Heritage.” Forrest is a native of Dothan and serves as the Alabama State Director of the Alabama Camellia Society. He has written articles for garden publications including a book entitled Camellia Garden Field Guide (Amazon Press). He also serves on the Board of Trustees of Troy University. Caitlyn Clark, horticulturist at DABG will lead the waxing demonstration and lead tours of the DABG Camellia Garden after lunch and again at the end of the day, at approximately 2:30. A variety of camellias will be available for sale during the workshop. Cost of the workshop is $30 which includes a box lunch. Spaces are limited. Please register online by visiting the DABG website at [www.dabg.com](http://www.dabg.com) or by calling the Gardens Office at (334)-793-3224. Deadline for registration is Jan. 10.",

    "text": "Gov. Gavin Newsom file photo\nWritten by\n[Frank Lopez](https://thebusinessjournal.com/byline/frank-lopez/)\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday proclaimed a state of emergency in response to the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\nThe move further enhances the state’s preparedness and accelerates the ongoing cross-agency response following the spread of bird flu in 16 states, Newsom said.\nThe virus has run rampant through Central Valley poultry and dairy facilities. It’s been detected in at least 650 herds in California. Referred to in a recent New York Times article as “Covid for Cows,” bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 herds in the U.S.\nThere has been no person-to-person spread of bird flu detected in California, according to health officials. Nearly all of the 34 individuals infected to date were exposed to infected poultry or dairy cows.\n“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak. Building on California’s testing and monitoring system — the largest in the nation — we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information,” Newsom said in a press release.\nOn Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first severe human case of bird flu in the United States — a patient in Louisiana who was hospitalized.\nAccording to the CDC, there have been a total of 61 reported human cases of bird flu reported in the U.S. since April 2024.\nOn Aug. 30, bird flu was confirmed in a dairy cow in Central California, and the California Department of Public Health immediately activated its Medical Health Coordination Center.\nWhile the investigation into the Louisiana case is ongoing, it been determined that the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks, the CDC states.\nIn a news release sent out Wednesday, freshman Assemblymember Alexandra Macedo (R-Tulare) said the governor has failed to protect Californians once.\nShe said the price of milk, dairy products and eggs have skyrocketed for consumers because of his inaction.\n“The Newsom Administration failed to enforce and fund basic standards to properly secure our borders at the state’s highways. Had the Newsom administration adequately funded inspection checkpoints for testing verification, vaccination records and branding paperwork – this Bird Flu may have been prevented,” Macedo said.",

    "text": "Reprodução/Instagram Quem era a empresária morta em cirurgia plástica na Zona Leste de SP A empresária Natália Cavanellas Thomazella , de 40 anos, faleceu na última segunda-feira (7) após complicações em uma cirurgia de lipoaspiração realizada na capital paulista. Casada e mãe de uma menina de três anos, ela era reconhecida no meio corporativo por seu trabalho em networking, tendo conectado milhares de profissionais ao longo de 15 anos de carreira.\nO procedimento foi realizado no Hospital San Gennaro, na Mooca, zona leste de São Paulo. Natália sofreu uma parada cardiorrespiratória durante a intervenção. Apesar dos esforços da equipe médica, ela não resistiu. O caso está sendo investigado pelo 42º DP (Parque São Lucas) como morte suspeita.\nNatália era uma figura influente no empreendedorismo feminino. Nas redes sociais, compartilhava dicas profissionais, experiências de maternidade e sua paixão por viagens e gastronomia.\nInvestigação e posicionamento médico\nO cirurgião responsável pelo procedimento emitiu uma nota afirmando que todos os protocolos de segurança foram seguidos, incluindo exames pré-operatórios e acompanhamento adequado. A equipe médica suspeita de uma embolia pulmonar, complicação rara, mas possível em cirurgias desse tipo. O Instituto Médico-Legal (IML) ainda determinará a causa oficial da morte.\nO Conselho Regional de Medicina de São Paulo (Cremesp) abriu investigação para apurar o caso. O Hospital San Gennaro também se manifestou, lamentando o ocorrido e afirmando que está prestando apoio à família e colaborando com as autoridades.\nO velório de Natália ocorrerá nesta quarta-feira (9), a partir das 13h30, no Cemitério Congonhas, com sepultamento às 17h15 no Cemitério Campo Grande.",

    "text": "Cold front will bring flooding rains, damaging winds to South Florida through Saturday A blustery mix of [torrential rain](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2024/02/19/cold-front-brought-record-rainfall-and-possibly-two-tornadoes/72656991007/) and damaging winds is forecast to thrash South Florida on Friday and Saturday with National Weather Service meteorologists predicting isolated flooding and a small risk of severe thunderstorms with [embedded tornadoes](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2024/01/08/el-nino-creates-conditions-ripe-for-tornadoes-like-fort-lauderdale/72147747007/). The rain is expected to come in waves beginning Friday morning and last through at least midday Saturday, but forecasters cautioned the timing of the soggy tumult is uncertain with two areas of low pressure in the northern and southern Gulf of Mexico abrading the state. \"This rather complex disturbance will bring the potential for multiple rounds of heavy rainfall,\" wrote Miami-based NWS meteorologists in their forecast. \"Damaging wind gusts would be the primary concern, but a couple of tornadoes certainly can't be ruled out.\" Sustained winds of up to 30 mph with gusts up to 40 mph are possible along the east coast with rainfall totals averaging 2 to 4 inches, but possibly as high as 6 inches in some areas of South Florida. A flood watch and a wind advisory are in effect from Friday morning through Saturday evening. The atmospheric upheaval threatens to soak several weekend events, including the Palm Beach International Boat Show in West Palm Beach and the 32nd annual [Palm Beach Pride](https://compasslgbtq.com/palmbeachpride/), a two-day festival in Lake Worth Beach celebrating the LGBTQ community. While the storms should clear Sunday for Palm Beach Pride's main attraction — an hour-long parade that has nearly 100 groups participating this year — Saturday could see a soggy start. The festival will be held at Bryant Park noon to 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Julie Seaver, CEO of Palm Beach Pride sponsor Compass, said the event will take place rain or shine. \"We've got our rain ponchos because no one is going to wash out Palm Beach Pride,\" she said. \"We do have contingency plans, but hopefully the park with dry out in time. The West Palm Beach GreenMarket is closed Saturday for the Palm Beach International Boat Show. The Storm Prediction Center said a \"marginal\" risk — the lowest level on a 5-tier scale — of severe weather is possible along the Gulf Coast and from Lake Okeechobee through the Florida Keys on Friday and Saturday . West Palm Beach has had 4.5 inches of rain this month, according to the Southeast Regional Climate Center. That's 2.4 inches more than a normal March and sets it apart from other South Florida cities, which are either near normal or have a deficit of rain. More: [Cloudy winter in South Florida ends as coolest in years with help of El Niño](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2024/03/04/national-weather-service-west-palm-beach-winter-was-coolest-in-decade/72837133007/) Much of the rain measured at Palm Beach International Airport this month came on March 3 when 3.3 inches was recorded. That broke a more than century-old record of 3.2 inches set in 1897. West Palm Beach weekend weather forecast Rain is expected through Saturday night even after the low pressure moves off the east coast of the state as an attached cool front filters through. High pressure builds in behind the front bringing \"dry and comfortable weather\" for most of next week, according to the National Weather Service. For Friday, rain chances increase from 70% in the morning to 100% in the evening with daytime high temperatures reaching about 80 degrees. Saturday's rain chances are 80% in the morning dropping to 30% at night. Daytime high temperatures on Saturday will again be near 80 degrees, but the overnight air will cool into the low 60s. Sunday should be sunny and breezy with a high of 78 degrees.

The deadliest assault on Lebanon in nearly two decades follows nearly a year of war between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza.\nThe “Palestinian and Lebanese resistance will have the final victory,” Khamenei said, accusing Israel of killing civilians because it was unable to defeat its foes.\nIran has been Hezbollah’s ally since the Lebanese armed group’s establishment in 1982.\nKhamenei blamed Washington for the escalation in Lebanon, which follows attacks last week that blew up pagers and hand-held radios distributed by Hezbollah.\nDespite assertions by Washington that it did not know the Israeli plans in advance, “the U.S. both knows and interferes,” Khamenei said, adding that President Joe Biden’s administration “needs a victory for the Zionist regime” before a presidential election in November.",
