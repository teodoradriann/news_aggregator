    "text": "Cold weather chic: Cate Blanchett in Carol, 2015 – Alamy\nA brisk walk or hike can really get your heart racing – but the prospect of doing that in the cold and rain doesn’t exactly inspire commitment to healthy living goals. At this time of year, everything is more tolerable when you have the appropriate kit. A properly warm coat can turn a dog walk into something truly uplifting. City pavements, treacherous when slick with rain, are barely noticeable in grippy, waterproof boots. And sub-zero temperatures? No problem when your head is cosseted in a cosy snood.\nAnne Hathaway at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival – Bryan Steffy/GC Images\nIt’s not all substance over style either; there’s plenty of outerwear that looks good and performs well, and this marriage can have huge potential as a mood-lifter during SAD season. Nobody understands this better than Georgia Dant, founder of the luxury modular outerwear brand Marfa Stance. ‘For me, the idea of bleak weather is kind of exciting,’ she says.\n‘I wanted to create something that allowed others to feel that way, because you can customise your coat depending on how cold it is.\n‘You can add a hood that’s bright fuchsia, or switch it for a pastel collar. These are things that I think make it a joyful experience when you’re dressing for the outdoors, because you have these layers that create warmth, but also add to your look.’\nMarfa Stance – CATHY KASTERINE\nAdidas x Spezial\nOf course, you don’t need to splash out on a new winter coat to imbue your cold-weather wardrobe with a bit of life if you already have one that does the job. Well-chosen accessories can deliver plenty of joy on their own. Consider the comfort of a scarf so big you can lose yourself in it, or the reassuring feel of boots in which you could walk for miles, or the colour-block hat that somehow transforms your tired face into one that’s rather photogenic.\nOversized scarves make a splash on the Adeam runway during New York Fashion Week – Getty\nAnd it’s all going to be on sale any second now, because retailers seem to be under the impression that spring is imminent – even April showers are some way off.\nGreat outerwear in inclement weather can make you feel unstoppable – which, as we set out our intentions for 2024, is a sentiment we can all get on board with.\nCosy staples\nCold weather clothes\nQuilted wax jacket, £475, Barbour x Ganni; Alpaca blend scarf, £190, Holzweiler\nCold weather clothes\nCashmere gloves, £69, Gobi Cashmere; Cashmere pom pom beanie, £184, Helen Kaminski; Leather boots, £285, Fracap at Toast\nCold weather clothes\nInsulated hard shell jacket, £354, Cortazu; Leather hiking boots, £140, Salomon\nCold weather clothes\nMerino wool scarf, £110, Sheep Inc; Lambswool hat, £95, Le Bonnet; Wool blend socks, £24.99, Pairs Scotland\n%n\nDiscover Telegraph Wine Cellar’s new wine club.

    "title": "Warrnambool road woes: an historic battle that rages on | The Standard | Warrnambool, VIC",
    "text": "Now hear me out on this one.I am not saying the roads in south-west Victoria are not in bad shape.In fact, in some cases they are appalling.But like we often observe, there really is nothing new under the sun.Going back through our archives here at \\u003ci\\u003eThe Standard\\u003c/i\\u003e, we have come across some photographs that show problems with Warrnambool and district roads are an age-old issue.Of course comparing historic passages in time is fraught with danger and like apples and oranges, but these comparisons do provide for some interesting observations.The obvious knock on the people fixing the roads today is they do not stand the test of time, a frustrating thing for the aggrieved as they believe modern technology should make the process faster and more steadfast.But to counteract that, the cost of such modern road making and repairing methods can be exorbitant.Also the amount of cars and trucks traveling on the roads are far greater than they once would have been. \\u003cbr\\u003eThis puts extra strain on the roads, as well as limiting the time available to carry out repairs or road building.CRB stood for Country Roads Board, a body which was created by the Victorian government in 1912 to oversee main roads in the state.Cars were relatively new at this time but poor roads were already a bugbear for many.While more money was put into roads as cars became more common, the CRB remained a whipping boy for those seeking the perfect road to travel on.The CRB stayed alive until 1983, when it was replaced by the Road Construction Authority.In 1989, VicRoads was named as the new authority, a status it still holds today.(We should note at this stage that local councils also hold responsibility for some roads in their municipalities). Like many government authorities, VicRoads cops its share of public scorn.Like many things that have come and long gone, the CRB is sometimes remembered through rose-coloured glasses. But newspaper articles and photos from back in the day show the CRB also suffered from brutal critiquing from the public.In the mid-20\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e century Warrnambool was a growing city and this was always going to challenge the conditions of the roads - whether they be under state or local jurisdiction. An example is the photo on this story which shows a car sunken up to its back axles in October 1974.The accompanying article in\\u003ci\\u003e The Standard\\u003c/i\\u003e said the car had sunk into the road on the corner of Liebig and Lava streets. \\u003cbr\\u003eThe cause of the sinking was blamed on sand laid over the top of new underground pipes. The sand had buckled under the weight of what looked like an old-school Ford family sedan.The fact it happened in Warrnambool's main street in the middle of the day heightened the seriousness of the issue.Maybe all involved retired to the old Grand Hotel (pictured across the road) to discuss the answer to the problem.We should note that one of the big issues with Warrnambool and roads has been the city's drainage.When it rains in Warrnambool in the middle of winter, it just keeps raining, and the photo we have from 1964 shows the damage that can be caused.Water pooling on the middle of Jamieson Street, with a line of school buses driving through it, give the road very little chance to survive unscathed. Lennon Avenue in Warrnambool's west was a goat track in the July of 1956, with this resident pictured above having to get off her bike to get through the mud.But the photo from September 1957 shows it wasn't just winter that caused all the trouble.This access road to Nicholson Street in East Warrnambool is little more than a muddied track, with even the most robust cars of the time having to work hard to get their way through. One of the most used roads in Warrnambool has always been Viaduct Road, a scenic route that gives breathtaking views of the city's beaches.But the road has always had a bit of a reputation for being a little bumpy, and in May 1962, things weren't looking good.\\u003cbr\\u003eOur photo shows the road riddled with potholes that had been filled up by autumn rain. When it comes to the country road surrounding the city, the state of play can be dire.In the news at the moment is a push to upgrade the Cobden-Warrnambool Road, an important thoroughfare that is crying out for some love.\\u003cbr\\u003eBack in October 1991, this road had some even bigger issues than it does today.\\u003cbr\\u003eAs our photo shows, the hole in the road looks like it could extend to the the depths of the earth.\\u003cbr\\u003eInteresting to note the road sign being held warns drivers to slow down.\\u003cbr\\u003eIn a more cautious 2024, that sign would not only be changed to stop, but a full road detour would likely be in place.",

    "text": "Vegetation in the Makkah region grew by 600% in the last five months following the frequent spells of rain in the region, says Saudi Arabia’s National Center for Vegetation Development and Combating Desertification. Some regions collected more than 200 millimeters of rain. Examinations of remote-sensing information showed that in August 2023, the overall vegetation cover measured 3,529.4 square kilometers, constituting 2.3 percent of the entire region’s land area. This coverage progressively expanded due to rainfall, reaching 26,256 square kilometers by the year’s end. Nearly 17% of the area was under vegetation by [December 2023](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2436871/saudi-arabia). The vegetation was primarily concentrated in elevated regions alongside the Red Sea coast, specifically in mountainous areas and highlands characterized by elevations from 500 to 2,600 meters. These areas include Makkah, Taif, Al-Laith, Al-Jammoum, Al-Kamil, and Khalis governorates. In the last five months, several videos and images of Makkah city flooded with rainwater have emerged on social media. Read more: [Saudi Arabia calls for restraint amid Red Sea tensions](https://www.globalvillagespace.com/saudi-arabia-calls-for-restraint-amid-red-sea-tensions/) The center has announced its ongoing examination of the condition of these vegetated areas. This involves closely observing alterations in afforestation project locations, keeping track of modifications in land cover, measuring rainfall amounts and vegetation density, and evaluating the well-being of plants. These assessments utilize remote-sensing methods and artificial intelligence technology, aiming to contribute to the success of afforestation projects and the broader objectives of the Saudi Green Initiative. The center is tasked to protect and harness the vegetation sites in the Kingdom. It explores variables that affect green spaces and prepares for and mitigates conditions of drought. This initiative is part of the National Transformation Project to help achieve the goals of Vision 2030 for development and diversification in Saudi Arabia. It functions within the context of nationwide initiatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of desertification and drought, as well as protecting and preserving land, pastures, forests, and national parks.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nDesde los templarios, los Borgia, el banco Ambrosiano, etc., son tantos los casos que indican que su reino sí es de este mundo, que levanta el ánimo ver que todavía quedan personas dentro de esta institución que creen en algunos pilares éticos. Abogo por más información directa, concreta, constante, para que poco a poco los sinvergüenzas queden cada vez más arrinconados en una sociedad cada vez más autocrítica.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Hasta que te informas y resulta que te obligan a hacer chorrocientos trámites y papeleos, además de visitas a parroquias buscando tu registro. Este coñazo echa a mucha gente para atrás.\nYa que en Hacienda se integran tan bien con la iglesia para la X del IRPF, a ver cuándo ponen otra casilla al lado de \"QUIERO APOSTATAR\".\n[#4](c4#c-4) [#2](c2#c-2) https://www.google.com/amp/s/cadenaser.com/nacional/2023/04/06/apostatar-en-espana-sin-datos-oficiales-y-con-un-proceso-relativamente-sencillo-cadena-ser/%3foutputType=amp gracias a los 2, al menos me habéis hecho replantearme la necesidad de intentarlo.\nQue miren en la fundación Las Edades del Hombre y en la Junta de Castilla y Leon y verán el lodazal de mierda que hay",
