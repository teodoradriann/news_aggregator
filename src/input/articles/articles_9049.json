    "text": "WINNIPEG — The premiers of Manitoba and Nunavut are hopeful a proposed hydroelectric and fibre optic project is moving closer to fruition and are seeking federal money.\nManitoba Premier Wab Kinew and Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok have signed a memorandum to work together on the project and ask Ottawa for capital funding.\nThe proposed Kivalliq Hydro-Fibre Link would see a 1,200-kilometre line built through northern Manitoba to several Nunavut communities west of Hudson Bay that currently use diesel to generate electricity.\nIt has been talked about for years and a recent estimate put the cost at $1.6 billion.\nManitoba announced this week it would dedicate 50 megawatts from its Crown energy corporation to the project, which Kinew says is only a start.\nKinew and Akeeagok met at the Manitoba legislature and said, given the current trade dispute with the United States, there is appetite for nation-building projects and efforts to build up the North.\n\"In terms of the price tag, these are things we'll sort out when they come to the table, which I'm sure they will,\" Kinew told reporters Wednesday.\n\"We need Ottawa to be able to come to site with us as well,\" Akeeagok added.\n\"All the political leaders so far have identified that there's going to be significant investments come to corridors or nation-building projects, and we really see this one aligning really well.\"\nNeither premier would say what level of funding they're seeking from the federal government.\nOttawa has already put up money for early stages of the project. Last year, it announced $2.8 million for design, environmental fieldwork and other tasks.\nThe project, put forward by the Inuit-owned Nukik Corp., could see construction begin as early as 2028. Aside from communities in Nunavut, it could also supply mines in the region and spur more economic development, backers say.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 16, 2025.\nSteve Lambert, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Putin Probes YouTube Speed Disruptions Amid Criticism President Vladimir Putin is addressing YouTube speed disruptions in Russia, allegedly intentional to limit criticism of him. The Kremlin claims Google's failure to upgrade equipment is responsible, while critics disagree. YouTube is crucial for opposition content, with officials acknowledging ongoing discussions with Putin. President Vladimir Putin is investigating the sluggish YouTube speeds and disruptions experienced in Russia, following concerns raised by the country's leading cinema authority. The Kremlin clarified this situation on Friday. YouTube critics argue that the platform's hindrance is a strategic effort by authorities to deter Russians from accessing content critical of Putin and his administration. However, Russia denies these allegations, attributing the issues to Google's inadequate equipment upgrades—a claim Google and technology experts dispute. Russian internet monitoring services have documented widespread YouTube outages recently, a platform operated by Alphabet's Google. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed the speed issues were due to Google's failure to adhere to Russian laws, advising that technical inquiries be directed to the communications regulator Roskomnadzor. Despite the tensions, more than 50 million Russians utilize YouTube daily, according to Mediascope. The platform is integral for the Russian opposition and independent news sources.

    "text": "WHO-released study shows global diabetes epidemic reaches critical levels with 800 million cases\nGlobal diabetes cases have quadrupled since 1990, affecting over 800 million adults worldwide, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) study released to coincide with World Diabetes Day.\nThe published findings highlight the need for immediate global action to address this epidemic, said the UN health agency.\nThe study was conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), a worldwide network of 1,500 researchers and practitioners in collaboration with WHO.\nIt is the first global analysis of trends in both diabetes rates and treatment coverage based on data from 140 million people across the world aged 18 or older.\nThe analysis revealed a doubling of diabetes cases from seven to 14 per cent between 1990 and 2022 with nearly 450 million adults – 60 per cent of those affected – remaining untreated. This emergency particularly impacts low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where 90% of untreated cases are located.\n“We have seen an alarming rise in diabetes over the past three decades, which reflects the increase in obesity, compounded by the impacts of the marketing of unhealthy food, a lack of physical activity and economic hardship,” warned WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nRegional challenges\nSoutheast Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions face the highest burden, with approximately 20 percent of adults affected.\nThese regions, along with Africa, report the lowest treatment rates, with fewer than four in 10 diabetic adults taking glucose-lowering medication.\nIn response to these challenges, WHO is launching a new global monitoring framework, focusing on key indicators including glycaemic control and access to essential medicines.\nThis product represents a crucial step in the global response, providing comprehensive guidance to countries measuring and evaluating diabetes prevention, care, outcomes and impacts.\nThis initiative complements the Global Diabetes Compact of 2021, which aims to ensure equitable access to comprehensive care. The framework represents a crucial step in standardising diabetes prevention and treatment approaches across different healthcare systems worldwide, said WHO.\nPath forward\n“To bring the global diabetes epidemic under control, countries must urgently take action,” Tedros emphasised.\n“This starts with enacting policies that support healthy diets and physical activity, and most importantly, health systems that provide prevention, early detection and treatment,” he added.\nWHO has set ambitious targets including 80 percent of diagnosed diabetes patients achieving good glycaemic control by 2030. This goal forms a broader strategy to address the root causes of the epidemic, while improving access to essential treatments.\nSupport Our Journalism\nWe cannot do without you.. your contribution supports unbiased journalism\nIBNS is not driven by any ism- not wokeism, not racism, not skewed secularism, not hyper right-wing or left liberal ideals, nor by any hardline religious beliefs or hyper nationalism.

    "text": "En la trocha Verdecia, ubicada en zona rural del municipio de Agustín Codazzi, Cesar, fueron hallados la mañana de este jueves dos cuerpos sin vida, correspondientes a dos hombres de una misma familia que, además de contar con múltiples heridas de bala, también reposaba sobre ellos un letrero alusivo a las AGC, mejor conocidas como el Clan del Golfo. Las víctimas mortales, identificadas como Luis Fernando Garzón García y Miguel Garzón Serpa, al parecer, habrían llegado hasta el lugar del crimen luego de recibir una llamada de sus victimarios en la que pactaron una cita. Así las cosas, al llegar al lugar para cumplir con el encuentro, terminaron siendo asesinados de varios impactos de bala que les propinaron, al parecer, a quemarropa. Por otro lado, el documento, que está en poder de las autoridades para su verificación, señalaba que, por extorsionadores, habrían sido asesinados. Sin embargo, los móviles del doble crimen siguen siendo materia de investigación por parte de las autoridades. Publicidad El coronel Alex Durán, comandante (e) de la Policía en el Cesar, confirmó que el CTI de la Fiscalía asumió las pesquisas del caso, en trabajo conjunto con la Policía Judicial para lograr la pronta identificación, captura y judicialización de los presuntos autores materiales. \"La investigación la va a tener a cargo el CTI de la Fiscalía y nosotros, como oficiales, vamos a estar atentos al procedimiento con el aporte de información\", dijo. Siendo habitantes del departamento del Cesar, la Policía no descarta que, tal vez, el doble crimen corresponda a un hecho de retaliación por la comisión de actividades ilícitas.
