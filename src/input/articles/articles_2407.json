    "text": "The UK welcomed in 2024 with a bang as tens of thousands packed out London and Edinburgh to watch the cities’ world-famous New Year’s Eve fireworks displays. Tickets for the event in London sold out and official viewing areas were full. Organisers finished checks on the pyrotehnics with more than 10,000 fireworks shooting up into the night’s sky after the Big Ben countdown.After millions watched the spectacular displays in Sydney and Auckland , city mayor Sadiq Khan joked that the events would be “nothing” compared to London’s show.He said planning on the event started in July, and over the last week 75 men and women have been “getting both sides of the River Thames ready”. However, it is a different story elsewhere in the country. A weather warning for strong winds covers southern coastal areas of England and Wales , and has resulted in the cancellation of two events.Plymouth’s Winter Wonderland and Barnstaple’s annual firework display have both been called off.A man on a bridge takes photograph of the first sunrise of the year at a park in Seoul, South Korea, 1 January 2024The sun rises on New Years Day as people take photos with their mobile phone over the skyline of Yangon, Myanmar, 1 January 2024People workout on the bank of Inya lake at dawn on New Years Day in Yangon, Myanmar, 01 January 2024In New York, tens of thousands of revelers are gathered in Manhattan’s Times Square to wait for the lighted ball to drop at midnight, after scheduled performances by musicians including Megan Thee Stallion and LL Cool J.Sabrina Carpenter performs during New Year’s Eve celebrations in New York City, New York, US, 31 December 2023Balloons are handed out to revellers gathered at Times Square during the New Year’s Eve celebrations, in New York City, New York, US, 31 December 2023A general view shows Times Square as seen from the New York Marriott Marquis during the New Year’s Eve celebration, Sunday, 31 December 2023Tens of thousands of revellers started 2024 with a bang as fireworks and drones lit up the sky over London and told the world the city is “A Place for Everyone”.After the bongs of Big Ben sounded midnight, “London: A Place for Everyone” was written high above the crowds as the unity-themed display welcomed the new year.In a display that lasted almost 15 minutes, 100,000 people cast their eyes to the sky to take in the firework, laser, and drone spectacular.As hits by the Spice Girls, Calvin Harris, Dua Lupa and others rang out across the city, revellers were invited to look back on 2023.The celebration referenced the King’s coronation and also used Charles’ Quote: to mark the 75th anniversary of the Windrush crossing in which he said the new arrivals “collectively enrich the fabric of our national life”.More here: People pose for a picture next to a sign celebrating the upcoming new year in Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais state, BrazilA woman holds flowers on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on New Year’s Eve, 31 December 2023A woman gestures at Copacabana beach while celebrating the New Year, in Rio de JaneiroThe Archbishop of Canterbury called on people to “stand with those suffering because of war and to seek to make peace” as he prayed for a peaceful 2024 in his New Year message.The Most Rev Justin Welby said “wars seem everywhere at the moment” as he delivered his annual start-of-the-year address.Speaking from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, he said: “Wars seem everywhere at the moment. Wars we know about, wars forgotten.“I’ve seen for myself the ongoing human cost of war.“Jesus Christ tells us to stand with those suffering because of war, and to seek to make peace.”In his address, the archbishop also praised the armed forces as he said they embody the theme of the King’s coronation last year.He said soldiers were at the centre of the celebrations not “just because the world marvelled at their displays of pageantry” but because they, “like many, many others in the country”, embodied service.The Archbishop of Canterbury’s New Year Message will be broadcast on BBC1 and iPlayer at 12.55pm on Monday January 1.Revellers at Edinburgh’s Hogmanay celebrations brought in the new year with an evening of fireworks and music from Pulp.Thousands gathered at the sold-out Princes Garden Street Party and Concert in the Gardens for the festival’s 30th anniversary.The event, organised by UniqueAssembly and City of Edinburgh Council, was be headlined by Pulp, who have not played in the city in 20 years.Following the first part of set, the fireworks began at midnight and crowds cheered, roared and sang.Mark Wright, 50, said: “This is the first time I’ve been here. The fireworks were brilliant.More here:Sadiq Khan has posted a video clip of London’s fireworks display, spelling out the messages that ran through the spectacle.He said: “From London to the world: a message of unity, love & hope. Our city is a place for everyone. You are free to be who you want and love who you want. Our NHS are the best of us. A greener, fairer, future is within our grasp.”Tens of thousands of revellers braved the cold and blustery weather to see London’s breathtaking New Year’s Eve firework show as the UK welcomed in 2024 with a bang.There wasn’t a spare place to stand along the River Thames near the London Eye as people from all around the world gathered to watch the 12-minute long spectacular which also featured a drone light show and music.Those in attendance, some waiting since 7.30am, cheered as the countdown started before the bongs of Big Ben sounded at midnight and the 12,000 fireworks lit up the dark and damp night sky.

    "text": "This post was originally published on here\nStay Informed, Stay Empowered in STL\nSubscribe to The St. Louis American ‘s free weekly newsletter for critical stories, community voices, and insights that matter.\nAliyah Almasri literally had her world come crashing down upon her on May 16, 2025.\nThe owner of Pop’s Market and The Sweet Creamery at 1107 N. Kingshighway was inside her business when the historic F3 tornado collapsed her roof and left her injured.\nIn addition to the structure’s major damage, her car was also damaged, leaving her without transportation.\n“The insurance on the building had lapsed just two weeks before,” Almasri said.\n“The building owner and insurance company are fighting. I’m trying to find out what I can do.”\nHelp us keep The St. Louis American free. Support us today! Almasri and dozens of other business owners and operators impacted by the devastating May 16 tornado attended the July 17 Business Recovery Resource Forum at St. Louis City Hall.\nLicense Collector Mavis Thompson, whose office hosted the event, said the forum was “more than just recovery.”\n“It’s about resilience. Our business community fuels hope and opportunities for our city, and [we must] ensure they have the resources they need to rebuild and move forward stronger than before.”\nIn-person consultations matched affected business owners with local, state, and federal agencies, who offered guidance and support for ongoing recovery efforts.\nSeveral business owners carried stacks of documentation, insurance paperwork, photos, property assessments, damage reports, and business records with them as they met with representatives of the city Assessor’s Office, Building Division, and St. Louis Development Corporation (SLDC).\nRepresentatives of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, Justine Petersen, the Missouri Small Business Development Center (SBDC) City Services including the Assessor’s Office, Building Division, and St. Louis Development Corporation (SLDC) also attended the forum.\nChristina Garmendia, policy director for the office of Board of Alderman President Megan Green, said business owners can reach out directly to her with questions or needs for assistance.\nShe asked business owners, by a show of hands, the number of years they had been in operation and if they were city residents. The informal inquiry showed that most were city residents and that they had owned their businesses for more than five years.\nThe tornado destroyed or damaged more than 5,000 structures including businesses, homes, and churches. Historic Black neighborhoods The Greater Ville and Fountain Park were blasted by the storm, which caused an estimated $1.6 billion in damage, among the highest figures for an individual tornado on record.\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials said the residential damage is the largest it had surveyed since the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri . The tornado claimed five lives, making it the first deadly tornado in St. Louis since 1959 .\nAmong the most heavily damaged areas of the city was its 10 th Ward, which is represented by Alderwoman Shameem Clark Hubbard.\n10th Ward Alderwoman Shameem Clark Hubbard (left) speaks with Aliyah Almasri, owner of Pop’s Market at 1107 N. Kingshighway, during the Business Recovery Resource Forum at St. Louis City Hall on July 17. The forum matched affected business owners with local, state, and federal agencies, which offered guidance and support for ongoing recovery efforts.\nPhoto by Alvin A. Reid / St. Louis American “We must work collectively to get resources out to the community,” she said while addressing forum attendees.\n“We are ready to fight and advocate for our businesspeople.”\n Hubbard added that business recovery is “case by case.”\n“Wholeness is going to look different for everyone.”\n11 th Ward Alderwoman Laura Keys, whose home was damaged by the tornado, said she was in conversation with many businesses in her ward about expansion before the tornado struck.\nSince May 16, she said “For the most part things have been going well.”\n“We have great businesses in our ward, many different kinds of businesses. As important as it is to retain our residents, we also want to keep our businesses and help them grow and thrive.”\nKeys said the dedication of her ward’s business owners was demonstrated by Everybody Eats Café and Restaurant at 2812 N. Grand.\n“They had only been open a few months when they were impacted by the tornado,” she said.\n“One day after the storm, they took everything out of the freezer and used the food to feed people in the neighborhood. It reopened last week. They want to stay, and they want to expand.”\nOther participating alderpersons were Michael Browning, 9th Ward; Sharon Tyus, 12th Ward; Pam Boyd, 13th Ward and Rasheen Aldridge, 14th Ward\nJoining Thompson as co-hosts were Gregory F.X. Daly, collector of revenue; Michael Butler, recorder of deeds; Donna Baringer, comptroller; and Adam Layne, treasurer.\nCounty Recovery Center closing\nFEMA has announced that the two Disaster Recovery Centers in St. Louis County will be closing permanently at 7 p.m. Thursday, July 24.\nThe three City Disaster Recovery Centers will remain open.\nUnion Tabernacle M.B. Church\n626 N. Newstead Ave.\nSt. Louis, MO 63108\nMonday-Friday: 8 a.m.-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 9 a.m.-4 p.m.\nSunday: Closed\nUrban League Entrepreneurship and Women’s Business Center\n4401 Natural Bridge Ave.\nSt. Louis, MO 63115\nMonday-Friday: 8 a.m.-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 9 a.m.-4 p.m.\nSunday: Closed\nSumner High School — Parking Lot\n4248 Cottage Ave.\nSt. Louis, MO 63113\nMonday-Friday: 8 a.m.-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 9 a.m.-4 p.m.\nSunday: Closed\nThose impacted by the tornado can apply for FEMA assistance before going to the Disaster Recovery Center online at DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling (800) 621-3362.\nThe deadline to apply for FEMA assistance is August 11, 2025.\nIf your home or personal property sustained damage and is not covered by insurance, FEMA may be able to provide funds to help pay for home repairs, a temporary place to live, and replace essential personal property.\nAt all locations, FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration are helping impacted residents with their disaster assistance applications, answering questions, and uploading required documents.\nWendy Todd of the St. Louis American contributed to this report",

    "text": "‘Dangerous lies.’ Texas Democrats blast ‘invasion’ rhetoric as border stalemate continues Texas Democrats again slammed state officials on Thursday for using hate speech to describe the situation on the border and called for more voices to condemn the rhetoric before it leads to violence. U.S. Reps. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio; Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso; and Greg Casar, D-Austin, joined human rights experts and other advocates to push back on the language as a convoy of self-proclaimed “patriots” and border hawks travel throughout the state to protest President Biden’s immigration policies. “For years, but especially over the past year, Republican elected officials have been spewing dangerous lies about an invasion at our southern border to distract from their failures to govern,” Castro said. But the targets of their ire – Texas Republicans – aren’t likely to listen, as they continue to drum up support for Texas’ Operation Lone Star and Gov. Greg Abbott’s insistence on state control over a section of the border in Eagle Pass. On Abbott’s orders, Texas National Guard troops last month took over a park in Eagle Pass that had been a popular crossing area for unauthorized migrants who entered Texas to turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents. The guard has since denied Border Patrol access to the park after Abbott said that federal policy of processing, then releasing some migrants, only exacerbates the problem. The “Take Back Our Border” convoy, which was largely organized online and reportedly includes far-right members who have hinted that a physical confrontation is possible, made stops in Central Texas Wednesday and is scheduled to continue to South Texas Thursday and Friday. Convoy organizers have billed the effort as a peaceful protest and there haven’t been reports of violence so far. But Escobar said the rhetoric surrounding the showdown on the border mimics language used by a white supremacist who murdered 23 people at an El Paso Walmart in 2019. The gunman traveled from North Texas to the border specifically to stop an “invasion” of Texas by Hispanics. “He drove over 10 hours to come to my peaceful, loving community of goodwill so that he could slaughter people in El Paso. And he did. He was successful,” she said. “He took 23 innocent souls. He injured dozens more. And my community continues to live with the pain and the trauma and the heartbreak of that day.” Escobar specifically called out Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who earlier this week embraced the notion that immigrants are invading Texas. “This is an invasion from third-world countries, they’re coming in here with health issues, they’re uneducated, unemployed and all they do is commit crime on the streets, most of them, many of them,” he told FOX News . Patrick also joined Abbott in asserting that Texas has a right to deny federal agents access to some parts of the river and take matters into its own hands. “We believe we are following the Constitution,” he said. “We have a right to defend American citizens and Texas citizens,” he said. That follows a statement from Abbott where declared that Texas was on solid legal footing to take control. “That authority is the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary. The Texas National Guard, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and other Texas personnel are acting on that authority, as well as state law, to secure the Texas border,” Abbott said last week. It doesn’t appear that Abbott will take the criticism to heart. While the Democrats were criticizing his tactics, the governor announced that he will be joined by 14 Republican governors this weekend in Eagle Pass.",

Si cerca un compromesso sui corridoi Filadelfia e Netzarim.

Lo riportano i media dello Stato ebraico. Poco prima l'emittente israeliana Channel 12 aveva pubblicato una lettera di Bar in cui il direttore dell'agenzia per la sicurezza criticava Ben Gvir e le violenze dei coloni israeliani in Cisgiordania. Secondo i quotidiani Israel Hayom e Maariv, il primo ministro Benjamin Netanyahu e altri ministri hanno difeso Bar dopo che Ben Gvir ha sostenuto che il capo dello Shin Bet è responsabile degli insuccessi che hanno portato al massacro di Hamas del 7 ottobre nel sud di Israele. Il ministro della Sicurezza nazionale ha accusato Bar di \"un fallimento nell'intelligence e di aver costantemente chiuso un occhio davanti al terrorismo e al nemico che ha pianificato omicidi di massa per anni\" e di \"cooperare con il movimento di protesta che ha indebolito l'esercito\". Ben Gvir ha accusato Bar anche di incitamento all'odio contro di lui e di \"interferenza con la politica\". Il capo dello Shin Bet ha inviato ieri una lettera a Netanyahu avvertendo che le recenti azioni terroristiche ebraiche come il massiccio attacco al villaggio palestinese di Jit nel nord della Cisgiordania hanno messo Israele sull'orlo del disastro, ha detto Channel 12. Ha accusato Ben Gvir e altri membri della coalizione di incoraggiare il fenomeno, come con la recente visita del ministro della Sicurezza nazionale alla Spianata delle mosche (Monte del tempio, per gli israeliani).",

    "text": "The Israeli embassy in South Korea is facing intense criticism for releasing a video “dramatizing” a terror attack on South Korean citizens, with the tagline “ Imagine if it happened to you.”\n| Al Jazeera The video depicts an imaginary scenario where a Korean woman is abducted by an armed assailant on Christmas Day and is forcibly separated from her daughter. The Israeli embassy posted the video on Facebook on Tuesday with a caption that said, “On October 7, Israel was attacked by Hamas terrorists. 1,200 men, women, and children were killed, and over 240 people were taken hostage in Gaza…Imagine if it happened to you. What would you do?”\n🇮🇱🇵🇸🇰🇷 In Israel, it appears that they have taken their campaign in the ongoing conflict to an extreme.

According to Israeli figures, the attack left around 1140 people dead, civilians included. Hamas also took around 250 hostages, and 129 of them still remain in captivity.\nOn the other hand, Israel has relentlessly bombed the Gaza Strip since October 8, killing at least 21,110 people, over 5,000 of them being children, according to UNRWA .\nEvery minute, every hour, the situation is getting worse in the📍 #GazaStrip\nThe reported number of children killed in #Gaza has now exceeded 5,000\nCeasefire NOW. End this horror NOW. pic.twitter.com/yn6V9bWSBM\n— UNRWA (@UNRWA) November 21, 2023\nHowever, Seoul’s foreign ministry deemed the Israeli embassy’s video “inappropriate,” given the security situation of South Korea, which is still technically at war with the North, and asked the embassy to take it down.\nThe killing and kidnapping of Israeli civilians by Hamas cannot be justified, but the Israeli Embassy’s production and distribution of a video drawing parallels to the security situation in another country was deemed inappropriate.\n— The Foreign Ministry of South Korea\nUpon the foreign ministry’s objection, the embassy eventually had to take down the video in question.\nWhat's Happening In Korea South Korea’s Most Anticipated “2024 Countdown Show” Completely Flops\n3rd-Gen K-Pop “Banger” Dominates Charts As Koreans Ring In 2024\nSouth Korea Sees Huge Spike In Digital Sex Crimes In 2023\nGroup Of Boys Spot Sexually Harassing A Mannequin On The Streets Of Hongdae…Police Fails To Act\nView All (255)",

    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell might run out of boxes to check before the 2024 NFL Draft arrives. Mitchell dominated in the MAC with six interceptions and 45 pass breakups the past two seasons with the Rockets. He caught the attention of Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy, who had other top-ranked draft prospects at the position turn down invitations to the annual pre-draft showcase in Mobile. Mitchell said he went to the Senior Bowl to compete and with a point to prove. \"That I can hang with the big dawgs,\" Mitchell said. He's rocketing up draft boards based on his dominance in practices and drills at the Senior Bowl, where Mitchell wanted to show his level of competition in college wasn't a cap on his ability or potential as a prospect. Mitchell, who said he watches Chiefs corner Trent McDuffie and the Eagles' Darius Slay, brought the same mindset to Indianapolis. \"The ball will get you paid,\" Mitchell said of what he learned in Mobile. \"At the Senior Bowl, I learned every ball that's thrown in the air is worth $2.5 million. I'm just trying to get that money.\" Speed testing won't be a problem. Mitchell was GPS chip-timed at the same top speed as Miami Dolphins All-Pro Tyreek Hill, 23 miles per hour. NFL Next Gen Stats uses the same technology and tracked only three scoring plays over 22 mph in the 2023 regular season: Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf (22.23, Week 13), Bengals running back Chase Brown (22.05 mph, Week 14) and Hill (22.01 mph, Week 5). The cornerback draft board is stacked with big names, headlined by Alabama's starting tandem of Kool-Aid McKinstry and Terrion Arnold. But recruiting rankings are meaningless at the moment. Toledo played primarily off-man coverage, freeing Mitchell to let his ball-hawk ability fly. By the middle of the 2023 season, prominent media draft analysts began surfacing Mitchell's name as a potential second-round cornerback. As of the start of the Scouting Combine this week, The Athletic and NFL Network rated Mitchell as a top-15 pick. At 193 pounds he ran the 40 in 4.39 seconds at a school timing day last spring. Mitchell said he has been timed even faster since and has a track background. \"I didn't come here to be mediocre. I came here to break records,\" he said Thursday.\nCue CB1: Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell 'can hang with big dawgs'\n- Field Level Media\n-\n-\n[0](/sports/national/cue-cb1-toledos-quinyon-mitchell-can-hang-with-big-dawgs/article_792664dc-2570-556f-bad7-812702121f73.html#comments)\nFeatured ",

    "text": "Los fans de 'Jujutsu Kaisen' recibieron un gran regalo por Navidad. Tal y como se había anunciado hace unos meses, el 25 de diciembre se pusieron a la venta en Japón los dos últimos tomos del manga, los cuales incluyen ilustraciones exclusivas e incluso\n[un epílogo que amplía el final](https://areajugones.sport.es/anime/jujutsu-kaisen-anuncia-un-nuevo-epilogo-de-su-manga-con-nuevas-paginas-de-contenido/) de la historia. Concretamente, Gege Akutami preparó escenas adicionales para cuatro personajes distintos.\nAdemás de mostrar los desenlaces de Nobara, Uraume y Ozawa, el autor de la obra presentó una serie de páginas centradas en Panda que generaron bastante revuelo en la comunidad. Para sorpresa de todos, en esta parte de la trama se introduce a los dos nietos de Yuta Okkotsu. ¿Y esto por qué es tan importante? Pues porque los fans creen que esto aporta la prueba que confirmaría uno de los romances más esperados.\nTras la salida del tomo 30 de 'Jujutsu Kaisen', cientos de fans acudieron a redes sociales para defender a capa y espada la teoría de que los jóvenes que aparecen en el epílogo de Panda son\n[los nietos de Yuta y de Maki](https://x.com/okkotsuloml/status/1871189406444613926). Tenemos confirmación de que descienden de Okkotsu, no hay más que ver a la chica para darse cuenta, pero los rasgos faciales del chico se parecen bastante a los de la poderosa hechicera de los Zen'in.\nAkutami nunca dedicó tiempo a desarrollar ningún romance entre sus personajes, sin embargo, en 'Jujutsu Kaisen 0' hay una escena en la que Maki se sonroja cuando habla con Yuta. Este momento provocó que los fans especulasen con una posible relación futura entre estos hechiceros, y al ver el aspecto de los nietos de Yuta, ahora muchos dan por hecho que ambos tuvieron que terminar juntos.\nMás allá de toda la especulación que gira en torno a estos hermanos, el nuevo epílogo de 'Jujutsu Kaisen' también desvela que Yuta terminó convirtiéndose en el nuevo líder del Clan Gojo. ¿Dónde se puede leer todo esto? Pues para poder hacerlo de forma legal en España habrá que esperar a que Norma Editorial publique el tomo 30 del manga, algo que podría suceder en 2025.\nCONTENIDO RELACIONADO\nGege Akutami emitió una carta hablando de lo difícil que ha sido trabajar en Jujutsu Kaisen, pero tiene un final esperanzador\nLa película recopilatoria de los hechos de la temporada 2 verá la luz finalmente en unos meses\nEste ha sido uno de los anuncios más esperados de la Jump Festa de este año\nEl volumen final del manga incluirá una serie de páginas centradas en Nobara y otros personajes de Jujutsu Kaisen\nEl ranking lo completan otras obras como Frieren, Spy x Family, Detective Conan y One Piece\nEs la tercera vez que la obra de Gege Akutami alcanza semejante hito",
