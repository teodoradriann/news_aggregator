    "title": "US Pledges $60M to Strengthen Ukraine's War-Torn Agriculture | Mirage News",
    "text": "Today, USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman announced that USAID will provide an additional $60 million to help mitigate the impact of Russia's war on agricultural production in Ukraine and accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery. Despite Russia's brutal war and its attempts to destroy Ukrainian farmland and agricultural export infrastructure, agriculture remains a key driver of the economy, generating over 60 percent of the country's export revenue last year. Following the passage of the National Security Supplemental last week, the United States will also provide at least $1.4 billion in additional funding to support Ukraine's economic recovery. This new initiative will work to improve Ukrainian farmers' production efficiency, sustainability, and competitiveness in the current war-time environment, while helping lay the groundwork for the sector's long-term, sustainable growth. The program will be part of USAID's groundbreaking Agriculture Resilience Initiative-Ukraine (AGRI-Ukraine) aimed at bolstering Ukraine's agricultural production and exports and to help alleviate the global food security crisis. Since July 2022, USAID has invested over $350 million in AGRI-Ukraine and leveraged more than $370 million from the private sector and other donors, providing a model for effective private sector partnerships. The initiative has already reached more than 32 percent of the country's registered farmers through providing seeds, fertilizers, crop protection, storage, access to financing and other services, helping over 14,000 farmers deliver the 2022 and 2023 harvests and plant their 2024 crops. At the launch event, Deputy Administrator Coleman underscored the importance of agriculture to the Ukrainian economy, as well as to global food security. USAID will continue to bolster the entire sector, safeguarding this major economic engine for future generations of Ukrainians, and restoring global food supply.

    "text": "RCMP in Richmond, B.C., say they’ve handed out $66,000 in fines over three months in a crackdown on illegal ride-hailing operators — including one who was a registered sex offender. Mounties said the initiative, a partnership with the Commercial Vehicle Safety Enforcement (CVSE) branch, targeted unlicensed drivers for six days, starting in June. Officers used unauthorized ride-hail apps to book rides with the illegal operators. Charges, including operating without a licence, wrong class of driver’s licence and failure to display a valid certificate were laid against 29 drivers. “There are a number of steps legal ride-hailing operators must take to be certified to operate in BC. These protections have been put in place to ensure the overall safety of paying passengers and other road users,” Richmond RCMP Insp. Mark Baxter said in a media release. [sent to your email, as it happens.](javascript:void(0)) Get breaking National news Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy . “Some of the drivers that were stopped during these operations have poor driving records, prior convictions for impaired driving and in one case the driver was a registered sex offender; all of these are things which would preclude the person from working for a properly licensed operator.” Police said one-third of the drivers were repeat offenders, including one driver who was allegedly caught for the third time.",

    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her.\nThe civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Francisco inició el mes de agosto con un viaje que llevaba años esperando: la Jornada Mundial de la Juventud en Lisboa. Este encuentro se había pospuesto desde 2022 debido a la pandemia. Durante su estancia en Portugal, el papa se reunió con políticos y líderes de distintas religiones e incluso viajó a Fátima para rezar con los enfermos. Pero la mayor parte de su tiempo lo pasó con los jóvenes. Escuchó confesiones, mantuvo encuentros personales o almuerzos. Les transmitió un mensaje de esperanza. Animó a todos y cada uno de ellos a vivir con valentía. FRANCISCO Tengan, por tanto, la valentía de sustituir los miedos por los sueños. Sustituyan los miedos por los sueños. ¡No sean administradores de miedos! No sean administradores de miedos sino emprendedores de sueños. Este fue su primer viaje tras la operación de junio. En el vuelo de regreso a Roma, señaló que se sentía bien y, de hecho esa misma semana, el pontífice reanudó sus audiencias generales de los miércoles y su agenda normal. En la solemnidad de la Asunción, el 15 de agosto, Francisco confió a María su preocupación por las regiones del mundo asoladas por la guerra. Rezó por la paz con 10.000 peregrinos en la plaza de San Pedro. A finales de mes, el papa recibió un galardón: el premio de periodístico llamado \"E' Giornalismo\", que se conoce como el Pulitzer italiano. FRANCISCO Debéis saber que, antes incluso de ser obispo de Roma, solía declinar los premios. Nunca los recibí, no quería. Y continué así también como papa. Sin embargo hay un motivo que me ha llevado a aceptar el vuestro y es la urgencia de una comunicación constructiva, que favorezca la cultura del encuentro y no del desencuentro. Los representantes del premio dijeron que tener a un papa como galardonado era una \"elección sin precedentes\" en su historia, pero que el compromiso del papa por la paz y la verdad encajaba perfectamente con su propósito.

    "text": "The CEO explains how Oklima supports companies in their voluntary contribution to global carbon neutrality Thomas Bladier, CEO de Oklima – © Andrew McLeish/EDF Edouard Laugier, in collaboration with Oklima What characterizes the carbon contribution market today? The carbon contribution market corresponds to companies’ growing awareness of climate issues, but also more broadly environmental issues, such as the collapse of biodiversity or the management of water resources. In 2023 in [France](/tag/France), the turnover of the carbon contribution market [ensemble des crédits vendus par des opérateurs] is around 250 million euros, according to the latest inventory of the Info Compensation Carbone platform. The activity is relatively modest but it is seeing growing interest from companies as they mature their decarbonization policy. They are primarily interested in symbolic projects, to raise awareness among their internal stakeholders, such as employees, and external ones, typically their clients. What is important is to choose contributions that complement what the company already does within its own scope. Carbon credit, carbon offset and now carbon contribution. Can you help us see it a little more clearly? Offsetting amounts to considering that everything is equal, a bit like a magic eraser that allows emissions to be removed from a carbon footprint. Concretely, this means, for example, considering that planting trees allows you to continue heating with gas or fuel oil. The problem with this approach is that we only have one planet, so there isn’t enough room to offset all corporate emissions. The latter must therefore reduce their own emissions. “Companies must account for the impact of these ‘carbon contribution’ actions separately from their own greenhouse gas emissions.” And they must also finance projects beneficial for the climate and biodiversity, and which could not be implemented without their contribution. They must account for the impact of these “carbon contribution” actions separately from their own greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, as for the carbon credit, it is above all a measuring tool. Oklima presents itself as the subsidiary of the EDF group specializing in quality carbon contribution. What does this mean? Oklima develops projects that help slow down climate change, and support the maintenance of biodiversity or the preservation of water. We offer committed companies the opportunity to finance these projects. We rely on independent labels verified by third parties which guarantee truly additional actions. Each of our French projects is thus verified by State services which ensure their impact. For example, we are not going to offer to a company to finance the replanting of trees in the forest on a plot naturally intended to accommodate trees. This is not a contribution because in reality this action would have been carried out even without the company’s funding. Very concretely, how do you support companies wishing to support climate action? The carbon or climate contribution must really meet a company commitment. We observe a diversity of expectations. Some seek the most local impact possible, close to their production or sales site. Others, more international, wish to demonstrate their solidarity with the populations of the countries where they are established. For each type of request, we have an advisory approach in choosing the type of project. We carry out in-depth investigations to ensure that they comply with the company’s challenges. We are also developing monitoring activities which may result in visits to funded sites. We develop projects ourselves in France and call on partners for projects abroad. “We develop the projects ourselves in France and call on partners abroad.” What are the key factors for a successful corporate decarbonization strategy? First point: the decarbonization strategy must be based on different pillars. First, the company must have a carbon footprint, have an ambitious plan to reduce its own emissions and carry out contribution actions in order to take action further. Second key to a successful corporate decarbonization strategy: the choice of projects consistent with the company’s values and positioning. What are Oklima’s ambitions and challenges for the years to come? We want to support all forest owners and farmers in this transition. Each farmer must find decarbonization levers that are consistent with the deployment of their farm. Finally, we aim to become a player in the decarbonization of businesses and the restoration of ecosystems at the European level within 3-5 years.",

    "text": "Para ese momento en el que los chicos toman un lápiz y empiezan a trazar sus primeras letras, intentando expresarse, fue pensada la publicación Preescolar Genios, cuyo primer número ya está en los kioscos con un memotest recortable y una caja de crayones de regalo. Preescolar Genios, que forma parte de la familia de publicaciones de la revista infantil Genios, es un libro que saldrá con frecuencia mensual, de original formato apaisado, con actividades para los chicos que están terminando el jardín de infantes y los que empiezan la escuela primaria. Antes de poder escribir, los niños de 5 y 6 años, van entrenando \"la mano\" con distintos ejercicios. En esta fase previa a la escritura, la grafomotricidad supone el desarrollo de los movimientos básicos necesarios para trazar de modo preciso las letras y los números. Esta habilidad se puede ir adquiriendo y reforzando a través de propuestas de distinto tipo: algunas más convencionales, como los trazos o la práctica de caligrafía; y otras, más lúdicas, donde se ponen en juego la observación, imaginación y creación. En este sentido, la primera edición de Preescolar Genios trae páginas para practicar trazos y las vocales, pero también incluye consignas para recortar y pegar y juegos de observación siempre sobre temáticas de interés infantil. Una pandilla de amigos curiosos son los simpáticos personajes que guían a los lectorcitos a través de las distintas propuestas. Las actividades del libro, para hacer en casa con el apoyo de la familia, apuntan a acompañar los conocimientos que los chicos van construyendo con sus docentes en el jardín de infantes. En todos los casos será aconsejable que una persona mayor lea las consignas y pregunte si fueron comprendidas, y que celebre los aciertos sin descalificar los posibles errores. La edición lanzamiento de la nueva publicación mensual Preescolar Genios, con un memotest de los oficios recortable y una caja de crayones de regalo, ya se consigue en los kioscos de diarios y revistas a $2.200.
