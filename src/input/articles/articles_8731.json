Whitmer commutes sentence for Saginaw Co. man that served 22 years behind bars by Mid-Michigan NOW\nThu, December 26th 2024 at 4:02 PM Darrell Phillips - photo courtesy of the Michigan Department of Corrections.PNG TOPICS:\nWhitmer Commutation Clemency Saginaw County Parole Criminal justice Michiganders Accountability LANSING, Mich. - Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced that she has granted several request for clemency.\nLast week, the Governor commuted sentences for five individuals.\nOne of those individuals, Darrell Phillips was sentenced to 35-60 years for armed robbery in Saginaw County. He was sentenced on October 22, 2001.\nA commutation reduces an individual's sentence to a specified term, making them eligible for parole consideration and subsequent release consistent with state law, but does not nullify the underlying conviction. To receive a pardon or commutation, an individual must file an application with the Michigan Parole Board. The applications are reviewed by the parole board on a case-by-case basis. Once an application has met the criteria for recommendation, it is sent to the governor’s office for review and a final determination.\n“As a former prosecutor, I am focused on protecting public safety, reducing crime, and building a stronger, smarter criminal justice system,” said Governor Whitmer. “I’m proud of our bipartisan work to help hundreds of thousands of Michiganders convicted of non-violent, low-level crimes get a second chance and reduce crime statewide. Today, we build on that work by granting clemency to eight Michiganders who have taken accountability for their actions. Let’s keep working together to build a justice system that treats all Michiganders equally.”\nStay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\n© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.

You can help Sega Retro by\n[adding to it].\nMonaco GP (モナコＧＰ) is a 1979 arcade racing game made by [Sega](/Sega). The game is very simple - all the player needs to do is avoid cars and obstacles on a track. He/she can speed up and slow down and two players may play at the same time.\nMonaco GP was Sega's last arcade game to use discrete logic circuits rather than a digital CPU, meaning it cannot be emulated in emulators such as [MAME](/MAME). The player's score and time are also displayed on external LED displays, so it is impossible to re-create the game perfectly.\nThe game only was ported to the [Sega SG-1000](/Sega_SG-1000) in 1983. The SG-1000 version had a difficulty select of one, two, or three other cars on the road. It was quickly followed by [Pro Monaco GP](/Pro_Monaco_GP) which uses similar hardware, but the series would not reach its peak until 1989's [Super Monaco GP](/Super_Monaco_GP). The game was, however, included in the Japanese release of the [Sega Saturn](/Sega_Saturn) compilation [Sega Ages Memorial Selection Vol: 2](/Sega_Ages_Memorial_Selection_Vol:_2). It was ported to several [mobile services](/Monaco_GP_(mobile)) between 2001 and 2006. An updated version of the game was released as part of the [Sega Ages 2500](/Sega_Ages_2500) series in Japan also.\nContents\n[1 Synopsis](#Synopsis)[2 Specifications](#Specifications)[3 Production credits](#Production_credits)[4 Magazine articles](#Magazine_articles)[5 Promotional material](#Promotional_material)[6 Photo gallery](#Photo_gallery)[7 Physical scans](#Physical_scans)[8 Technical information](#Technical_information)[9 References](#References)\nSynopsis\n“ |\nA red formula car travelling at high-speed through the streets, speeding up, jumping, manoeuvering to the right and left to avoid the cars obstructing the way and reckless cars coming close to your machine, ········· be on the lookout for an ambulance suddenly passing by ········· and keep an eye out for the sign posts!!

    "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers have confirmed the signing of free agent center Trey Jemison.\nThe LA Lakers made a roster move, waiving Quincy Olivari to make room to sign center Trey Jemison .\nJemison is a player who likes to do the dirty work, and claims to be ‘elite’ at what he does.\nIt’s an interesting move for a Lakers team who lack depth at the center position, adding a player who is in his second season in the NBA.\nHe was cut recently by the New Orleans Pelicans, who were prioritising the development of rookie center Yves Missi , a first round draft pick .\nPhoto by Justin Ford/Getty Images Trey Jemison achievement Trey Jemison’s best stretch in the NBA in his career came last season during a stint with the Memphis Grizzlies .\nHe set a record in the process with a 24 point game against the Washington Wizards, the team for who he made his NBA debut.\nJemison’s score ended up being the highest number ever scored in the NBA by a former Univerity of Alabama at Birmingam (UAB) graduate.\nIt was a proud achievement for the player, and a sign of what he can do on the offensive end of the court too.\nTrey Jemison has now set a new record for points in an NBA game by a former UAB player with 18 (and counting) 👀 https://t.co/PU4ZXGP34I\n— UAB Men's Basketball (@UAB_MBB) March 13, 2024 View Tweet What Trey Jemison did well Memphis Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins spelled out what he liked about Jemison’s career best performance last season.\nHe explained: “I thought he did a really good job of screening and rolling, something we’re continuing to work with him on, the chemistry with the guards out there. I thought he did a good job of really getting hits because they were staying with their own, and that freed up our guards quite a bit\n“I’m really impressed. Overall, I’m proud of him, career high and all of that stuff, but he is doing the little things that impact winning.”\nLeBron James recently said that the Lakers are continually trying to improve their roster , and this latest move shows there is some work being done.\nJemison will get an opportunity to show what he is capable of, and he can’t ask for more than that.\nIf he can bring his peak Grizzlies form to the Lakers with some consistency, then he has a chance to be successful in LA.",
