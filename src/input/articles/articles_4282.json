    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza.\nThe news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead.\nMs Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others.\nIn the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family.\nMs Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza.\nBut six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza.\nOn Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza.\nIt was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths.\nThe couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said.\nUS President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter.\nThe families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement.\nMs Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs.\nThe kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza.\nMr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician.\n“Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement.\nAl Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go.\nAlmost all were women and children.\nHe said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her.\nAccording to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity.\nNir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped.\nThe families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones.\nMr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office.\n“I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.",

James Grandy says the accident happened at about 6:50 a.m. on Highway 5, when a south-bound Toyota Corolla struck an oncoming Ford van.\nHe says the driver and two passengers in the Toyota died while the van driver suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\nGrandy says initial investigations determined the driver of the Toyota had been trying to to pass a semi-trailer truck.\nBarriere Fire Chief Ashley Wohlgemuth says the crash happened just south of the community, about 64 kilometres north of Kamloops.\nWohlgemuth says a dog in the car also died.\nPolice say Highway 5 in Louis Creek six kilometres south of Barriere has been closed for the investigation.\nBarriere Mayor Ward Stamer says the site of the fatal crash is very close to where a collision claimed two lives on the Labour Day weekend.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "title": "YouTube in a Position To Become The Leader of Video Streaming in 2025",
    "text": "YouTube is the most-widely used video streaming service in the world with a net worth of $550 billion currently, making it the king of all media. The video streaming service, due to its variety of content, is also poised to become the leader of all video content media in revenue generation and screen timing in 2025 as per the statistics.\nAccording to the analyst Michael Nathanson at MoffettNathanson , YouTube was the second-largest company by revenue in 2024 with a generated revenue of $54.2 billion, just behind Disney, which the company is in a position to replace as the top most company in 2025. Moreover, in the past 12 months, for the second time in February 2025, YouTube became the largest aggregate TV content source in the US as per the screening time. Which means that it surpassed even the giants, like Disney, Fox Corp, Paramount Global, Netflix etc.\nAccording to Nathanson's analysis, if YouTube remains on the same trajectory, it will grow even further in 2025, allowing it to even become the premier streaming aggregator. The numbers surely do indicate this end result. YouTube generated $36.15 billion in ad revenue in 2024 alone, and its subscription revenue in the 12-month period until September 2024 topped at $15 billion. YouTube TV service has become the biggest online TV service in the USA with more than 8 million subscribers; plus, its YouTube music and premium services have crossed 125 million subscribers. He says that YouTube will have 10% of the share of the $85 billion TV industry by the end of 2026 and will surely become the leader in the industry.\nNathanson also predicts that YouTube operating income, which was $7.8 billion in 2024, will likely grow to $10.2 billion this year and will grow further to $13.8 billion in 2027, with operating margin increasing from 14% to 16% and then 18% respectively. This he says will be due to more subscriptions and better subscription rates.\nAnother factor that will increase YouTube subscribers and help it in increasing its revenue is better smart devices and faster internet. In the upcoming years, better versions of the existing smartphones will enter the market which will be faster and will expand the scope of online streaming services. Also, new ways to give access to faster internet are replacing the existing ones, like the Starlink project by Elon Musk. Such technologies will give access to the internet to areas where the internet is still unknown. Both will force people to prefer online services like Youtube to traditional TV due to its convenience and variety it offers, thus increasing its subscribers.\nImage: DIW-Aigen\nRead next: OpenAI Anticipates Delays in New Image Generation Tool for ChatGPT Due to Capacity Challenges",

    "text": "News Fire Danger map shows most of San Benito County is at high risk, updates on county fire department By Dania Romero May 7, 2025 7:00 PM Published May 7, 2025 2:55 PM SAN BENITO, Calif. (KION) - Dry grass stretches across open fields near Nash Road, a reminder of the increasing fire danger across San Benito County. With fire protection contracts set to expire at the end of this year, the county is now accelerating efforts to form its own fire department.\nCounty supervisors have launched the search for a fire chief to lead the creation of the new department, which will replace services currently provided under contract with Hollister Fire. That contract ends in December.\n“We want somebody that's looking towards the future, not just stuck in the past,” said San Benito County Supervisor Ignacio Velazquez.\nThe county’s plan includes building multiple fire stations to provide broader coverage. Velazquez said the goal is to place stations on the west side, in central areas, and the eastern part of the community, while also figuring out how to serve South County.\nThe urgency is underscored by new hazard severity maps released by CAL FIRE, which show that most of San Benito County is now considered a high-risk area for wildfires.\nResidents living in these danger zones are taking the threat seriously.\n“It’s very important that we have enough coverage for our community and enough firefighters so they’re not in danger,” said one woman who lives in a high-risk area. “Everyone — homeowners, families — we all need protection.”\nAnother homeowner added, “It’s very dangerous, but we do our part to keep our property safe. And we hope everyone else does too.”\nThough some, including Hollister Fire Chief David Goulding, believe city and county collaboration works best, he said he supports the county’s decision to establish its own department.\nLaunching the department will cost an estimated $3 million, according to Velazquez, but it will also create new jobs and opportunities for local residents.\n“Our goal is to look here locally for young people who want an opportunity to work in fire services,” Velazquez said.\nStill, the clock is ticking.\nWith only months to go before the existing fire contract expires, county officials are working quickly to get systems in place.\nWhen asked if the department would be ready in time, Velazquez responded, “What we're gonna make happen, we need to make happen. We need to make sure the public understands they’re going to be protected — they’re going to be safe.”\nThe county hopes to hire an interim fire chief by the end of the month and plans to announce soon when the public can begin applying for fire service positions.\nArticle Topic Follows: News Jump to comments ↓",

    "text": "Aljaz Skorjanec and Janette Manrara on Escape to the Country (Image: INSTAGRAM) Escape To The Country fans have exploded with rage over the celebrity edition of the show, exclaiming: \"Just because you can make a celebrity version doesn't mean you should!\" One follower exclaimed on Twitter (X) last night that it was \"out of touch\" and \"condescending\" to feature \"two rich celebrities shopping for houses that are pushing £1m on a property show at 7pm on the BBC \".\nAnother enraged viewer blasted: \"Our licence fee is paying for their house in the f g country!!! Talk about rubbing it in our noses! Who the f*** commissioned this?!!\" Some viewers didn't think much of the properties featured either, with one claiming that, despite the potentially eye-watering price tag, it looked as if it was set in \"the middle of a council estate\".\n\"Nothing about this episode is watchable. And please explain why 'celebrities' need help finding properties?\" asked another incredulously. The celebrities ruffling so many feathers were Strictly Come Dancing stars Aljaz Skorjanec and Janette Manrara , with the latter a regular fixture on our TV screens presenting It Takes Two this year.\n\"The only thing more irritating than this pair is the clap, I imagine!\" one tweeter groaned, while another blasted: \"If she says wow one more time, I will scream \" The couple had headed to rural Cheshire on the lookout for a new location after Janette gave birth to their daughter Lyra Rose earlier this year.\nThe dancer announced her return to work just weeks after Lyra was born, whereas Aljaz volunteered to do the lion's share of childcare so that she could continue TV hosting. That left one more issue to resolve - where the couple were going to live.\nREAD MORE: Jasmine Harman addresses 'depressing' family Christmas abroad after quitting UK [LATEST]\nThe married pair had been renting, but were hoping to put down more permanent roots.\nThey looked like they were having a great time on the show, hanging out with miniature ponies in tranquil Knutsford and generally enjoying the joys of the remote countryside.\nThis week, Janette took to her Instagram account to confirm that their property-hunting experience had been \"special\".\n\"We did some very special filming today in our new place we call home.
