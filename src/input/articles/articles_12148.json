    "text": "Luxury Presence has introduced Private Listings Hub, an invitation-only platform designed to help real estate agents promote off-market and pre-market listings with greater control and discretion.\nThe platform allows agents to decide how and when to share listings , from limiting visibility to their brokerage to broadening exposure across the Luxury Presence network.\nThe tool matches listings against more than 300,000 active buyer needs, drawing from a network of high-performing agents who handle more than $300 billion in annual sales.\nIt also aligns with recent clarifications to the National Association of Realtors’ Clear Cooperation Policy , enabling the selective sharing of “office exclusives” and pre-market promotions under new delayed marketing status provisions.\n“For luxury agents whose clients demand privacy, Private Listings Hub provides a versatile way to market off-market and pre-market properties,” said Malte Kramer , CEO of Luxury Presence. “You can share within your brokerage only, automatically match with agents who have qualified buyers, handpick a shortlist of agents, or broadcast to everyone on our platform.”\nAgents can control listing visibility, filter buyer matches and receive notifications for relevant off-market opportunities. The platform builds on Luxury Presence’s earlier Brokerage Listing Network release, offering brokerages and agents compliant solutions for handling private listings.\n“I work with many high-profile clients who value privacy, so having the option to market privately on the Luxury Presence platform is a huge advantage,” said Jade Mills, a top-producing agent with more than $9 billion in career sales.\nThe platform will roll out to Luxury Presence customers over the next three weeks and will later become available to qualified agents outside the network.\nIn January, Concierge Auctions entered a co-marketing partnership with Luxury Presence, offering Luxury Presence clients the ability to promote upcoming auctions.",

    "title": "Mayo Clinic, Aiforia Partner on AI Model for Colorectal Cancer Recurrence",
    "text": "What You Should Know: – In a groundbreaking collaboration, [Aiforia](https://www.aiforia.com/), an AI company specializing in pathology solutions, and [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/) have announced the exclusive licensing of a [revolutionary AI](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/artificial-intelligence/) model that improves the prediction of colorectal cancer recurrence. – The successful development and licensing of this AI model marks a significant milestone in the fight against colorectal cancer. As this technology becomes integrated into clinical practice, it has the potential to transform the landscape of cancer care, leading to improved patient outcomes, reduced treatment costs, and a more personalized approach to managing this prevalent disease. AI Model The AI model, meticulously trained on extensive datasets, analyzes digitized tissue samples to identify 15 key histological features. By combining this data with two additional clinical parameters, it generates a personalized colorectal cancer recurrence risk score for each patient. This score empowers physicians to make informed treatment decisions, potentially paving the way for: - Reduced reliance on unnecessary chemotherapy: By accurately identifying patients with a low risk of recurrence, the AI model can help avoid unnecessary exposure to the harmful side effects of chemotherapy. This not only improves patient quality of life but also reduces the financial burden on healthcare systems. - Targeted therapy for high-risk patients: For those patients predicted to be at high risk of recurrence, the model can guide physicians towards more aggressive treatment options, potentially improving their chances of successful long-term outcomes. Beyond the Numbers The impact of this AI-driven approach extends far beyond mere cost savings and treatment optimization. It marks a significant step towards personalized medicine, where each patient receives a tailored treatment plan based on their unique biological and clinical profile. This shift empowers both patients and physicians, fostering a more collaborative and informed treatment journey. A Collaborative Journey The Aiforia-Mayo Clinic partnership extends far beyond the development of this single model. Their collaboration began in 2020 with the implementation of Aiforia’s AI-assisted image analysis software in Mayo Clinic’s pathology research. Today, over 70 Mayo Clinic pathologists utilize Aiforia’s tools to develop their own AI models for future clinical application, and more than 30 ongoing research projects leverage Aiforia technology. This ongoing collaboration highlights a deep commitment to continuous innovation and the translation of cutting-edge AI into tangible clinical benefits. “This is the first example of an AI model developed with the Aiforia platform, which is used to assess the risk of cancer recurrence. It is also the first clinically relevant AI model developed with a customer and commercialized by Aiforia. The licensing agreement with the Mayo Clinic enables us to market and sell this AI model for colorectal cancer recurrence risk evaluation globally, says Jukka Tapaninen, the CEO of Aiforia. “This is an example of many similar AI model co-development projects, which are ongoing with the Mayo Clinic and other partners. These will enable us to significantly enrich our product portfolio.”",

    "text": "Fans who’ve been patiently waiting for the upcoming remakes of two Konami classics in\nMetal Gear Solid 3 and Silent Hill 2 may finally have cause to be excited as both titles have been quietly confirmed as releasing at some point this year.\nIn a\nblog post outlining the big releases of 2024, PlayStation has nodded to both Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2, with a very clear disclaimer in the article saying that “All featured titles scheduled for release in 2024 at the time of publication,” which all but seals the deal. Of course, tentative release dates are always subject to change – especially ones that haven’t been otherwise revealed – but it’s hard to believe we won’t see these launch in the next 12 months.\nThe Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is coming from Konami and developer Virtuous and will seemingly be a faithful recreation of the PS2 classic, going as far as including the original voice work. Meanwhile, the remake Silent Hill 2 is being handled by Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team and will reportedly feature overhauled gameplay mechanics and reimagined story sequences among other updates.\nRELATED: PlayStation Has Revealed The Most-Played Games In Australia And The Rest Of The World In 2023\nHere’s how the\nPlayStation Blog post describes each of the games:\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\nRe-discover the origin story of iconic military operative Snake and unravel the plot of the legendary METAL GEAR series. METAL GEAR SOLID DELTA: SNAKE EATER re-envisages the immersive stealth action gameplay of the PS2 classic with modern audio-visual design, returning players to the riveting world of METAL GEAR.\nSilent Hill 2\nExperience a master class in psychological horror – lauded as the best in the series – recreated for PlayStation 5 with chilling visuals and visceral audio.",
