    "text": "Scots travellers are set to face even more chaos this weekend with heavy rain and snow forecast. [Storm Gerrit](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/scottish-news/major-search-underway-missing-surfer-31764536) brought havoc to the country on Wednesday with roads closed and ferry and train services cancelled. And there is little let up with two [weather](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/weather) warnings in place on Saturday, December 30. Thousands will be hitting the roads this weekend ahead of the New Year while [Celtic](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc) fans will travel from across Scotland to Parkhead for the Old Firm match. The two yellow alerts both start at 8am on Saturday. A warning for rain and snow is in place until 11.59pm for almost all of the country above the Central Belt as well as western parts. Met Office forecasters say an \"active frontal system will extend northeastwards through Saturday bringing heavy rain to low levels and a period of snow across higher ground to some parts of Scotland\". Up to 25 millimetres of rain could fall in some parts and while snow will be largely confined to higher ground, up to three centimetres could fall in north-western parts even at lower levels.

The snow is expected to turn to rain throughout the day which may lead to flooding on already saturated ground. As well as travel delays, the conditions could cause power cuts and some rural communities could even become cut off. The warning covers [Angus](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/angus), Clackmannanshire, [Dundee](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/dundee), Perth and Kinross, Stirling, [Fife,](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/fife) Aberdeenshire, Aberdeen, Moray, [Highland](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/highlands), Western Isles, [ Argyll and Bute](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/argyll-and-bute), East Dunbartonshire, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. The second warning lasts until 3pm and covers [Dumfries and Galloway](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-and-galloway), Borders, [East Lothian](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/east-lothian), Midlothian, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and [South Lanarkshire](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/south-lanarkshire). The Met Office says: \"A band of rain, with snow on high ground for a time, will extend northeast across southern Scotland on Saturday morning, clearing from the west in the afternoon. \"Rainfall totals of 15 to 25 mm are expected across the warning area in a few hours, and 30 to 40 mm possible over hills, along with 2-5 cm of snow above 250-300 metres.\" Bus and train journey times are expected to be longer while spray on the roads will present a hazard to drivers. Interruption to power supplies and other services is \"likely\" according to forecasters. It comes as teams from Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution make a final push to get the power supply back on for homes after Storm Gerrit. Around 450 properties remain without power two days after the storm struck. SSEN say these homes are confined to rural parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen. The power supply to around 47,000 homes was cut off by the tempest. For more news, follow us on [here](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/).",

    "title": "Bengal Students Make Automatic Electric Pump To Tackle Water Wastage - News18",
    "text": "Three students from Basirhat in West Bengal have developed a model that automatically turns the pump on and off when the water tank is full or empty, providing a solution to a common problem in water management. When using an electric water pump to draw water, tanks often overflow, leading to the wastage of both water and electricity. To address this issue, three ninth-grade students devised a unique invention. They created an automatic electric water pump model using sensors and a microcontroller. This innovation ensures that when the water tank fills up, the pump will automatically turn off, and when the tank is empty, it will turn on again. Consequently, no one needs to manually operate the pump. The advanced technology of this water pump model has astonished everyone, as it was developed by three students from a government school in a remote village of Basirhat. These students, from Bel’s Dhanyakuria High School in Basirhat, North 24 Parganas, successfully created this innovative pump model. The primary mechanism involves using sensors placed at the top and bottom of the water tank. These sensors detect the water level and automatically send signals to the pump switch, turning it on or off accordingly. This mechanism significantly reduces water wastage. The device functions as an automatic water pump controller. Many people often forget to turn off the pump, resulting in substantial water wastage. Implementing this model can address water scarcity and promote electricity conservation. The pump is designed to automatically activate when the water tank is 50% empty and deactivate just before the tank is full, ensuring optimal water usage. Furthermore, this invention has the potential to make a significant impact on water and energy conservation efforts. In many areas, water is a scarce resource, and the efficient management of the water supply is crucial. By preventing the overflow of water tanks, this model conserves water, which is especially important in regions facing water shortages.",

    "text": "HAZEL PARK, Mich. (WXYZ) — Hanging out with his young son inside is exactly where Jaylin Harris wants to be, especially with weather like this. “It was very cold,\" Harris said. \"As soon as I walked outside, hands instantly got cold.” Harris just moved back from Arizona and his son is now a kindergartner in Detroit Public Schools Community District. With the bitter cold set to continue, Harris was calling for school to be canceled. “He gets a ride, but I know a lot of parents out here in Detroit don't have the opportunity to drive their kids to school,\" Harris said. That’s why Detroit is one of [more than 300 schools and school districts, closing Tuesday](https://www.wxyz.com/weather/school-closings-delays) due to the weather. Hazel Park Schools is also closed. “There will be schools that will be open because it’s kind of on that verge between -10 and -15 degree wind chill,” Hazel Park Superintendent Amy Kruppe said. Kruppe says a lot of factors go into making the decision. She and other superintendents in metro Detroit consult with each other and meteorologists. Wind chill of -15 is usually the threshold she uses when deciding whether or not to cancel school, and while wind chill was the main reason for closing, ice also played a role. “Several of us closed early and made that decision based on the sidewalks are icy,\" Kruppe said. \"We're not going to be able to put salt on those sidewalks, and it's very dangerous for those kids.\" “We have a lot of children out here that walk because their parents don't have reliable transportation,” Harris said. As for Harris, he’s thankful Detroit schools are closed and hopes they’ll be closed again Wednesday, so he can spend time with his son indoors and out of the cold. “I would encourage you to stay home, grab a book, grab some hot chocolate and make some good memories with your family,” Kruppe said. As the cold continues, some schools may also announce closures for Wednesday. Related: [School closings and delays](https://www.wxyz.com/weather/school-closings-delays)",

(Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images)\nCanada will now be without head coach Bev Priestman for the rest of the Paris Olympics.\nCanada Soccer announced on Thursday that, after their 2-1 win over New Zealand to kick off the games earlier in the day, Priestman was being suspended and sent home from the Olympics in the wake of their drone spying scandal. Assistant coach Andy Spence will serve as the team's interim coach throughout the rest of the Olympics.\nThough a Canada soccer staffer was caught flying a drone over New Zealand training earlier this week in France , which is what sparked the scandal, the issue has apparently been going on for quite some time. According to TSN , both the men's and women's national teams have \"relied on drones and spying for years.\" They even apparently used them to film closed door training sessions of opponents during their gold medal run in the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\"Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue said in a statement . \"In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend women's national team head coach Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.\"\nThis post will be updated with more information shortly.",

    "text": "Engineers at the University of Florida have unveiled a new 3D printing method known as Vapor-Induced Phase-Separation 3D Printing (VIPS-3D). This pioneering approach, detailed in a recent publication in Nature Communications, facilitates the production of both single-material and multi-material objects in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.\nSpearheaded by Dr. Yong Huang and his team from UF’s mechanical and aerospace engineering department, this technique employs specially formulated eco-friendly liquids as the “ink” for the printer. During the printing process, a non-solvent vapor is introduced into the printing area, triggering the solidification of the liquid components and resulting in the formation of solid structures.\nThe versatility of the VIPS-3D method allows for the creation of custom-designed objects with spatially tunable, multi-scale porosity, offering manufacturers unprecedented control over the properties of their products. By adjusting printing parameters and the amount of sacrificial material utilized, engineers can tailor the porousness of the objects to meet specific application requirements. This capability is particularly advantageous in industries such as medical implants and aerospace manufacturing, where the ability to precisely control porosity is crucial for optimizing performance.\nAccording to Dr. Marc Sole-Gras, the lead author of the study and former graduate student in Dr. Huang’s lab, the VIPS-3D method holds immense promise for applications in bone tissue engineering, where implants must seamlessly integrate with surrounding tissues. The ability to print implants with precisely controlled porosity ensures optimal biocompatibility and promotes tissue regeneration.\nFurthermore, beyond its technical advancements, the VIPS-3D process offers significant environmental benefits compared to traditional 3D printing methods. By utilizing sustainable materials and consuming less energy, this innovative technique reduces the environmental footprint associated with additive manufacturing.\nWith two patents already secured and support from federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, the VIPS-3D method represents a significant step towards a more accessible, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable future for 3D printing technology.\nYou can read the full paper, titled “Vapor-induced phase-separation-enabled versatile direct ink writing” at\nthis link.\nSource:\nnews.ufl.edu\nCome and let us know your thoughts on our\nX, and weekly additive manufacturing newsletter to get all the latest stories delivered right to your inbox.",

    "text": "African plant scientist praises China Felix Dakora, former president of the African Academy of Sciences, has praised China's efforts to promote the exchange of germ plasm of crops species as climate change causes a decline in crop biodiversity. He said that more extreme weather events, with unusual temperatures, wildfires, flooding and drought, are putting a lot of pressure on the preservation of crop species' biodiversity, and the international exchange of germ plasm could be a solution. \"If it's lost in one region completely, you can replenish it by importing from, literally taking germ plasm in another part of the world such as Sanya,\" Dakora said, referring to the tropical city in South China's Hainan province that is home to a national breeding base where plant scientists from across the globe can conduct research. The South African plant scientist said China has emerged as a major food producer over the past decade through huge investment in agricultural technologies. He expressed confidence that Africa, working closely with China, can soon emulate that prowess in food production and achieve self-sufficiency.
