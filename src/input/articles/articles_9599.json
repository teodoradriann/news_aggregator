    "text": "Quiet Start to 2024\nHappy New Year! We are welcoming 2024 with some quiet weather in Sothern New England. Today will be dry with a blend of sun and clouds and seasonable temperatures topping out in the lower-40s. Cold air moves on in overnight tonight with mainly clear skies. We are expecting to drop into the lower-20s by Tuesday morning. Tuesday and Wednesday are looking mainly sunny, seasonable and dry with temps topping out 40-45. Our next chance of rain is on Thursday. A cold front brings a 40% chance of rain developing in the morning. and through Thursday evening. Temperatures drop for Friday with highs in the 30s and sunshine returns. Saturday is the winner of the weekend with mostly sunny skies and highs un the upper-30s. All eyes are on Sunday as models are indicating the development of a coastal storm that could bring snow and wind to Southern New England. As with all coastal storms, the track will be the key to who gets what and how much. Given that we are the better part of a week away, this forecast will be refined through the coming days.

    "title": "'She runs the room': Suzie Brunswick, operating room nurse at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital | Local News | reformer.com",
    "text": "BRATTLEBORO — Suzie Brunswick is and has been an operating-room nurse at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital since 1976 — 47 years and 9 months to be exact.\nShe was born in Oneida, New York in 1952. Even as a girl, “I knew I had to have a career. My mother’s best advice: I needed to be able to support myself. The prince won’t come, or, at least, don’t count on the prince coming.”\nGene Marshall, a family friend and mentor to Suzie, lived in nearby Pratts Hollow, N.Y., an upstate village of about 11 homes, a bar, a post office, and church. Gene was an operating room nurse in a nearby hospital in the ’50s and ’60s, and Suzie wanted to be \"just like her.”\nAfter going to State University of NY at Morrisville for nursing training, in 1973 Suzie married Lee Brunswick. They moved to the Brattleboro area in 1974. Two years later she took a job as a nurse in the operating room at BMH. Ever since then she has gotten up before 6 a.m. at the home where she lives today, then with her husband and son, in south Guilford, down near the Massachusetts border.\nBy 7 a.m. she is at BMH ready for a day’s work. Once a patient scheduled for an operation arrives, is checked in and prepared for surgery, Suzie may be the one who settles him or her on a stretcher and wheels the patient into the operating theater. There Suzi will be joined by five or six colleagues. (Only since October 2022 have the three brand-new, state-of-the-art operating rooms in the new Ronald Read Pavilion opened.)\nThis spanking new four-story wing, as many of you remember, resulted from a very significant bequest by Read, a man who lived very simply in the woods in Dummerston, saved his money, cut his own firewood, and often went to have breakfast in the cafeteria at the hospital. There he developed a bond with the BMH staff and clinicians. He also enjoyed talking investments when the opportunity arose with others having breakfast. The three state-of-the-art operating rooms where Suzie Brunswick works were funded by the Brattleboro-based Thomas Thompson Trust. Read lived in Brattleboro when he died.\nOne of her supervisors told me “Susie is a circulator — she runs the room.” Even before the operation starts, she makes sure everything that is needed before, during and after the surgery is in place. She collaborates with everyone. If an instrument is needed, she gets it. And during the operation she “keeps the pace. She sets the bar high.”\nThere could be five to seven operating room members gathered: the surgeon, anesthesiologist, physician’s assistant, scrub tech, the nurse who gets the instrument... Suzie’s role is to help do what needs to be done during an intense and highly concentrated hour or more. Suzie said, \"And the more complex the operation, the more of us are needed. Everyone is calm, quiet, deeply focused and carefully coordinated. We rely heavily on each other. We’re a team.”\n“My mother used to ask me, ‘Why do you do this? So much stress... There must be something else you can do,’ and my answer was and always is 'We make patients better.'” Suzie told me “Our team has the patient’s health in mind with everything we do. Our goal is to make them better.”\n(To put Suzie’s story into a larger context, in the fiscal year 2022, a total of 3,816 day-surgeries and medical procedures were carried out within a BMH budget of $45.6 million.)\nAnd as she said, “Teamwork is absolutely crucial and deeply valued in the operating room. Everyone is as important as everyone else.”\nSuzie retired March 3, 2023 but continues to work per diem (when she is needed). When scheduled, she works 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. The other part of her “retirement” is that she remains as the Laser Safety Officer at the hospital. She must ensure that all employees who operate, maintain and service laser products are properly trained. She provides annual education to all staff who use lasers in any way.\nBut she does have a life outside BMH. She and her husband were involved in The Boy Scout troop in the area and they volunteered for any number of Guilford organizations. “Years ago, he and I used to snowmobile a lot too. We went all around southeastern Vermont or up to Island Pond... Once we went west to Montana and on another trip we snowmobiled in Yellowstone National Park for days and days.”\nHer son graduated from Brattleboro Union High School in 1999 and he too volunteered. “And after my husband passed away a few years back and my son no longer lives at home, when I get home I look after my dear dog Madison. I’m 71, a private person, and I still work at BMH about four days a week or when they need me, but I don’t have to be on call. Is that called retirement?”\nAnd then, near the end of our interview, I got to see another side of Susie. As we were leaving the Board Room where I interviewed her, I looked back at this grand, high-ceilinged room in which we sat. There was a perhaps 18-foot long shiny, oval conference table with some 20 chairs set around it. There stood Suzie Brunswick, 5 feet tall, 71 years of age, with 47 years of work in the operating room behind her and more in front of her, in this grand room. In that hospital, she was playing a role as key to the work of the hospital as any board member or president who would hold meetings around this august table. A hospital is, more than most, an utterly integrated organization of people: nutrition services, housekeeping, nurses, doctors, lab technicians, office staff, administrators, the guys plowing the snow in the winter so people can park... Everyone is crucial as work goes on 24 hours a day, year after year, to keep us all healthy.\nGordon Hayward of Westminster writes about individual men and women who contribute day in and day out to the life of our community here in Southeastern Vermont.",

    "title": "Víspera de Navidad en Belén: un pueblo fantasma donde la guerra en Gaza detiene las celebraciones",
    "text": "El lugar donde según la Biblia nació Jesús, normalmente abarrotado, era un pueblo fantasma el domingo después de que las celebraciones de la víspera de Navidad se cancelaran en Belén debido a la guerra entre Israel y Hamás.\nTodo lo publicada sobre la guerra en Gaza\nNo estaban las luces festivas ni el árbol de Navidad que suelen decorar la plaza del Pesebre, ni tampoco las masas de turistas extranjeros que se congregan cada año por las fiestas. Docenas de agentes de seguridad palestinos patrullaban la plaza vacía.\nLas tiendas de regalos abrieron tarde en la víspera de Navidad, aunque unas pocas lo hicieron una vez paró el aguacero. Pero había pocos visitantes.\n“Este año, sin el árbol de Navidad y sin luces, sólo hay oscuridad”, dijo el fraile John Vinh, un monje franciscano de Vietnam y que vive en Jerusalén desde hace seis años.\nÉl siempre iba a Belén por Navidad, pero este año era especialmente sombrío, explicó mientras miraba a un nacimiento en la plaza del pesebre, donde un niño Jesús envuelto en una tela blanca recordaba a los cientos de niños muertos en los combates en Gaza. Había alambre de espino en torno al belén, y los adoquines grises no reflejaban luces alegres ni los destellos de color que suelen llenar la plaza durante las navidades.\n“No podemos justificar sacar un árbol y celebrar con normalidad, cuando algunas personas (en Gaza) ni siquiera tienen casas a las que ir”, dijo Ala'a Salameh, uno de los propietarios del restaurant Afteem, un local familiar de falafel a unos pasos de la plaza.\nSalameh dijo que la víspera de Navidad suele ser el día más atareado del año. “Normalmente no puedes encontrar ni una silla para sentarte, estamos llenos de la mañana a la medianoche”, dijo Salameh. Este año sólo había una mesa ocupada, por periodistas que se tomaban un descanso de la lluvia.\nEl restaurante operaba en torno a un 15% de la capacidad normal y no podía cubrir los costes operativos, señaló Salameh. Estimó que incluso cuando termine la guerra, tomará otro año que el turismo vuelva a Belén con normalidad.\nLa cancelación de los festejos navideños es un duro golpe para la economía local. El turismo supone en torno al 70% de los ingresos de Belén, casi todo durante las navidades.\nMuchas grandes aerolíneas han cancelados los vuelos a Israel y hay pocos extranjeros de visita. Las autoridades locales indicaron que unos 70 hoteles en Belén se han visto obligados a cerrar, lo que deja a miles de personas sin trabajo.\nUnos 20.000 palestinos han muerto y más de 50.000 han resultado heridos durante la ofensiva aérea y terrestre israelí contra Hamás, que gobierna Gaza, según las autoridades de salud del territorio, mientras que el 85% de los 2,3 millones de residentes se ha visto desplazado. La guerra comenzó tras el letal ataque de Hamás del 7 de octubre contra el sur de Israel, en el que los milicianos mataron a unas 1.200 personas, la mayoría civiles, y se llevaron más de 240 rehenes.\nLos combates en Gaza también han afectado a la vida en Cisjordania. Desde el 7 de octubre, el acceso a Belén y otras poblaciones palestinas en el territorio ocupado por Israel ha sido difícil, con largas filas de conductores que esperan a pasar los controles militares. Las restricciones también han impedido que decenas de miles de palestinos salgan del territorio para trabajar en Israel.",

The mercury has fallen to record levels in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and the national capital Delhi among others. Visuals shared by news agency ANI show heavy fog covering the towns which has led to the delay in train operations as well.\nAirports have issued advisory for the travellers to check the status of their flights directly with their respective airlines as visibility has reduced significantly. Delhi airport said that visibility has gone down to zero metres and only CAT-III compliant aircraft would be able to conduct a smooth landing.\nA thick blanket of fog in Agra, Mathura and other towns of Uttar Pradesh has led to slow traffic movements. The iconic monument Taj Mahal was barely captured in the visuals as dense haze covered it.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the minimum temperature can touch the 10 degrees Celsius mark in the region while the maximum temperature is expected to be around 19 degrees Celsius in Agra on Friday. Visuals from Madhya Pradesh's Gwalior showed fog descending on roads blocking the sunlight in the region.\nIn Rajasthan's Jaipur, roads were seen heavily engulfed by a layer of fog and a similar scene was there in Amritsar where haze has drastically reduced the visibility and cold conditions have increased.\nThe grip of the cold wave has impacted the train operations with many running behind time.
