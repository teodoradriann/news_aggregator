    "text": "[Mariska Hargitay](https://en.newsner.com/tag/mariska-hargitay/) has played a police officer on television for the past 25 years, but recently she found herself playing one in real life too when a lost child approached her thinking she was a real officer. The actress and mother of three paused filming for roughly 20 minutes while she helped the child locate their mother. A witness told [People](https://people.com/mariska-hargitay-mistaken-for-real-life-police-officer-by-young-girl-on-svu-set-8634829) that a young girl had become separated from her mother at the Anne Loftus Playground in Fort Tryon Park on April 10. The girl, appearing oblivious to Hargitay’s scene partner, Ice-T and the film crew, approached Hargitay and asked for help. Hargitay then paused production for 20 minutes while she helped the little girl look for her mother. Thankfully, the two were able to reunite in less than a half hour. Hargitay has played Olivia Benson on Law and Order: SVU since the series premiere in 1999. The show is currently in its 25th season. It looks like all those years of playing a police officer on TV paid off! Thanks to Mariska for helping the young girl find her mother.

    "title": "Instagram's \"View Once\" Feature Will Now Actually Prevent People From Sharing Your Photos",
    "text": "On social media, we open ourselves up to the world. Unfortunately, some people in that world have malintent. Particularly vulnerable to social media scams are image-focused platforms like Instagram. To combat a rising issue of image extortion, Instagram is rolling out new safety features as of today.\nInstagram Is Adding New Safety Features to Prevent Image Abuse\nAnnounced today via Meta's Newsroom, as part of a collaboration with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Thorn, Instagram will now put new measures in place to prevent crimes like \"sextortion\" and \"intimate image abuse.\" These types of scams often target younger, teen users and involve the threat of distributing an intimate photo unless payment is received—or, extortion.\nInstagram's new measures include protecting disappearing images from being captured by screenshots, monitoring follow requests, and nudity censorship.\nDisappearing Image Protection\nA feature rolling out \"soon\" to all Instagram users will be the inability to take screenshots or screen records of ephemeral images. These are photos or videos sent with the \"view once\" or \"allow replay\" feature within Instagram DMs or the Messenger app.\nPreviously, if you sent a disappearing message to someone, they could capture it with a screenshot, and you would be notified that they did so. However, if you try to take a screenshot of a disappearing image now, you'll just capture a black screen with an Instagram notification letting you know you \"can't screenshot or record this.\"\nFollow Requests and Follower Lists\nStarting today, Instagram will also start flagging profiles that have certain qualities representative of scams, such as newly created accounts. When those profiles send follow requests to teen users, Instagram will block or move the request to the spam folder. For any accounts that slip through the cracks, Instagram may also send teens an alert, such as if the user they're talking to is located in a different country.\nAdditionally, as lists of followers and following have previously been leveraged in extortion tactics, Instagram will also block those lists from accounts it flags for \"scammy behavior.\"\nNudity Censorship for Teens\nFollowing Instagram's roll-out of Teen Accounts last month, the platform will now apply one of its beta safety measures to all Teen Accounts, as well as offer it as an optional feature to all users worldwide. Instagram's nudity detection feature blurs images that the algorithm deems as containing nudity in Instagram DMs.\nAdditional Crisis Resources\nSafety features can only go so far, and unfortunately criminals will find ways to work around such protections. For this reason, Instagram is providing additional resources, such as integrating a Crisis Text Line for US users to reach out to when they suspect scams.\nHowever, a resource like a text line only works when people know to ask for help. To combat the potential embarrassment or avoidance of reaching out for help, Instagram has worked with the NCMEC and Thorn to create an educational campaign, including a video documenting red flags and best practices.\nSadly, it seems this vicious crime is on the rise, with \"reports of online enticement increasing by over 300% from 2021 to 2023,\" according to the NCMEC. Of course, social media is ripe for scams, but as long as you know what to look for, you can typically avoid them. Education is key, and I'm pleased to see a social media heavyweight like Meta putting effort into not only features, but resources to equip its users with knowledge.",

    "title": "Turkish and Greek Navies Collaborate in NATO's Exercise Ariadne-2024 in Aegean Sea",
    "text": "The naval forces of Türkiye and Greece recently showcased their commitment to regional security and cooperation by participating in a NATO mine countermeasure training exercise, dubbed Exercise\nAriadne-2024. Conducted in the strategic waters of the Aegean Sea, the event underscored the importance of allied naval powers working in unison to enhance mine countermeasures capabilities within the military bloc.\nStrengthening NATO's Maritime Security\nThe exercise, which took place on March 2, saw the participation of Türkiye's minehunter\nTCG Anamur and Greece's HS Evropi, both integral members of Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 2. This annual event is pivotal in improving the interoperability and effectiveness of NATO forces in detecting and neutralizing sea mines, a critical aspect of maritime security that ensures the safe passage of civilian and military vessels in international waters. Through exercises like Ariadne-2024, NATO aims to bolster its collective defense and deterrence capabilities, particularly in regions of strategic importance such as the Aegean Sea.\nFostering Cooperation Amidst Regional Rivalries\nThe participation of Turkish and Greek naval forces in this exercise is particularly noteworthy, given the historical tensions between the two nations over territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea. However, their collaboration within the framework of NATO exercises such as Ariadne-2024 highlights a shared commitment to regional stability and the safeguarding of critical maritime routes. This cooperative spirit is crucial for the effectiveness of collective defense measures and for maintaining a unified front against common threats.\nThe Significance of Exercise Ariadne-2024\nExercise Ariadne-2024 represents more than just a routine training operation; it is a testament to the adaptability and cohesion of NATO's naval forces in responding to evolving maritime threats. By focusing on mine countermeasures, the exercise addresses one of the most insidious dangers to naval operations and international commerce. The successful completion of such drills enhances the alliance's readiness and capability to manage and mitigate the risks associated with naval mines, thereby contributing to global maritime security.\nAs Türkiye and Greece continue their collaboration within the NATO framework, Exercise Ariadne-2024 serves as a beacon of cooperation, demonstrating the potential for mutual understanding and joint action even amongst nations with complex histories. The enduring significance of these drills lies in their ability to foster a culture of collaboration and preparedness, ensuring that NATO remains a formidable force in maintaining peace and security in the maritime domain.",

    "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris made a historic stop at Planned Parenthood's St. Paul facility with Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday in an election-year effort to underscore the commitment of President Joe Biden to reproductive care.\nThe vice president's office said the visit marks the first by a sitting president or vice president to a clinic that provides abortions, but Harris emphasized the broader scope of care provided there.\n\"Please do understand that when we talk about a clinic such as this it is absolutely about health care and reproductive health care so everyone get ready for the language: uterus,\" she said. \"That part of the body needs a lot of medical care, people.\"\nHarris briefly toured the facility with Walz, Dr. Sarah Traxler, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood North Central States; Ruth Richardson, Planned Parenthood's regional president and CEO; and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, who represents the area.\nThe vice president stopped for a few minutes to talk to the reporters packed into the reception room and drive home the administration's commitment to restoring the abortion protections the U.S. Supreme Court scrapped when it overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nShe thanked the clinic employees, Walz, McCollum and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter for maintaining access to care. She denounced restrictions in other states that prevent women from obtaining similar care \"within any reasonable distance\" of their home.\n\"I've heard stories of and met with women who've had miscarriages and women who were being denied emergency care because the health care providers there at an emergency room were afraid that, because of the laws in their state, that they could be criminalized, sent to prison for providing health care,\" she said.\n\"So I'm here at this health care clinic to uplift the work that is happening in Minnesota as an example of what true leadership looks like,\" she added.",

    "text": "Winter Warming Center to open Sunday Published 11:09 Beautiful. That is the word Joanne Coleman, SC3, used more than once to describe the community’s response to helping meet the needs of the homeless in anticipation of sub-freezing temps. Individuals, businesses, industry, churches and other nonprofits responded to a list posted by SC3 earlier this week when the Sulphur nonprofit announced its Winter Warming Center, 501 E. Burton St., in Sulphur, will open 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. beginning Sunday evening, Jan. 14. In addition to donations the endeavor includes the Open Door Biker Church, Freedom 337, Empowerhouse Ministries, Sulphur Community Church and Care Help. “Helping others, serving, that’s part of being a Christian,” Coleman said. “I think people want to help, but knowing how to help and helping in the right way is never easy.” Givers shared funding, food, jackets, blankets and other supplies. Volunteers who will help operate the warming center have been trained in advance. “Knowing how to help and helping the right way is never easy,” Coleman said. “You have to love people where they are.” Typically, SC3 serves the homeless Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. The following items are sought to supply the overnight warming center and future efforts to shelter the neighbors with no homes: new pillows and pillow cases, heavy blankets, lap blankets, coffee, creamer and sugar, individually packaged snacks, pre-packaged breakfast items, canned or bottled drinks, paper plates and plastic utensils, trash bags (15 and 55 gallon), sanitizing products, flashlights and batteries, jackets and sweatshirts, new mens and womens underwear, winter hats and gloves, dog kennels, leashes and food, laundry detergent and small heaters (for homes), Financial donations are used to fill any gaps. Items can be shipped to or dropped off at 501 E. Burton St., Sulphur, LA, 70633, M-Th, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.",

    "text": "The coming days are set to be a washout with heavy showers, hail and thunder before a major U-turn.\nMet Éireann has said the weekend will be unsettled and rather cool for the time of year, as a mix of sunshine and showers start off the days before bands of rain sweep across the country bringing heavy rain as well as hail, thunder and even spot flooding.\nAs well as rain, temperatures are set to drop on Friday and some wintry falls are possible and a touch of frost is likely in some sheltered spots while the mercury dips to between 1C and 4C. Some wintry falls are also possible on Saturday night.\nAlthough Sunday will start out dry, rain will extend nationwide in the evening with heavy falls pouring down on the country. Monday will be quite the same, some heavy falls are possible with the chance of some spot flooding.\nThankfully, Tuesday mostly signals the end of the wet few days and is expected to bring a good deal of dry weather but there will be some showers.\nHowever, Alan O’Reilly from Carlow Weather has warned that rainfall amounts could vary between forecasts for next week. He wrote: “Low pressure in control next week but positions of low systems vary on the two models. This means rainfall amounts will vary a lot across forecasts and apps etc.”\nHere is Met Éireann’s forecast for the weekend:\nFriday Fresh and increasingly breezy today with a mix of sunshine and showers. Showers will mainly affect western and northern areas at first, but will spread across the country during the day on a strong westerly breeze.\nSome of the showers will be heavy with hail and the slight chance of lightning. Later in the day, showers may turn wintry on high ground. Highest temperatures of 7C to 10C.\nCold and windy on Friday night with a mix of clear spells and showers, some of the showers will be heavy and prolonged with hail and thunder possible.\nSome wintry falls are possible, mainly over the hills. Lowest temperatures of 1C to 4C in fresh to strong westerly winds. A touch of frost is likely in some sheltered spots.\nSaturday Saturday will be a fairly windy day with a mix of sunny spells and showers with the continued chance of hail and thunder. Some wintry falls are possible in the morning on high ground. Highest temperatures of 7C to 10C, but feeling colder in a fresh to strong northwest breeze.\nCold and breezy on Saturday night with clear spells and scattered showers. Lowest temperatures of 2C to 5C with fresh and gusty northwest winds, moderating later in the night.\nSunday Sunday will start out dry in most areas with just the odd shower. However, rain will develop in the southwest during the morning, spreading across Connacht, Munster and south Leinster by afternoon.\nRain will then extend nationwide in the evening. Highest afternoon temperatures of 8C to 11C with mostly light and variable breezes at first but a freshening southerly breeze will develop later on.\nWidespread outbreaks of rain on Sunday night with some heavy falls. Lowest temperatures of 5C to 9C with moderate to fresh south or southeast winds.\nIt will be a cloudy and wet weekend\nMonday It looks set to be a cloudy and wet day on Monday with outbreaks of rain. Some heavy falls are possible with the chance of some spot flooding.\nMaximum temperatures of 8C to 11C in moderate southeast or variable winds. Rain is expected to ease on Monday night with good dry and clear spells developing. Lowest temperatures of 3C to 6C in a moderate northeast breeze.\nTuesday Tuesday is expected to bring a good deal of dry weather overall but there will be some showers, especially over the northern half of the country.\nThe best of the sunshine is likely in southern and southeastern counties. Maximum temperatures generally ranging from 10C to 13C but a little cooler in the northeast with a moderate northeast breeze.\nLargely dry on Tuesday night with clear spells. Lowest temperatures of 3C to 7C in moderate southeast winds.\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.
