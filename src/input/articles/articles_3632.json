    "title": "Why Are More Than 30,000 Boeing Factory Workers Going On Strike?",
    "text": "Over 30,000 factory workers at the US plane manufacturer Boeing have stopped working, causing production of the 737 Max to come to a halt. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) saw 96% of its members vote in favor of striking, with almost 95% rejecting the proposal. Jon Holden, IAM District 751 president, remarked that the members had clearly expressed their stance. He emphasized that the issue was about respect, addressing past grievances, and fighting for the future. Boeing responded by pledging to resume negotiations. They acknowledged that the tentative agreement previously reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members and expressed their commitment to resetting their relationship with employees and the union, and to returning to the negotiation table for a new agreement. Boeing facing series of setbacks This industrial action is part of a series of setbacks for Boeing, which has struggled to recover from fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. In January, a cabin panel on a 737 Max jet detached mid-air during a commercial flight, leading to increased regulatory and legal scrutiny. In July, Boeing reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter net loss of $1.44 billion. Before the vote, recently-appointed CEO Kelly Ortberg urged workers to support the deal, warning that strike action could jeopardize the company’s recovery. The IAM had also recommended the offer to members, but dissatisfaction persisted, including concerns over senior management pay. Former CEO Dave Calhoun had earned nearly $33 million in 2023. The offer that was rejected included a 25% pay increase over four years and Boeing’s commitment to build its next commercial plane in the Seattle region. However, the union had been seeking a 40% pay increase along with various other improvements to worker benefits.

Depending on its duration, it could disrupt operations for nearly 10,000 Boeing suppliers across all 50 US states. The company employs a total of 150,000 people in the US and estimates its annual contribution to the American economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs both directly and indirectly. Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing, stated that the strike was about fighting for the future and emphasized the union’s commitment to addressing issues important to its members. Boeing expressed its eagerness to return to negotiations, acknowledging that the tentative agreement was not acceptable to the members and reiterating its commitment to reset its relationship with employees and the union. Past concessions and a series of issues at Boeing, including layoffs and shifting work from a unionized assembly plant to a non-union factory, had fueled widespread anger. Consequently, the vote against the contract was anticipated despite the offer’s contents. Earlier in the week, Boeing’s new CEO Kelly Ortberg recognized that members were unhappy with past contract terms but urged them to overlook past frustrations and support the deal. He expressed a desire to reset the relationship with the union but noted that the company’s new leader was not necessarily to blame for the strike. Holden noted that the extensive problems faced over the past 16 years and the impact of company leadership over nearly 20 years were significant factors in the strike. Boeing remains a crucial part of the US economy Despite years of issues, Boeing remains a crucial part of the US economy. The strike represents just the latest challenge for the company. In the past five years, Boeing has faced numerous problems, some tragic and many embarrassing, which have been financially devastating. Two fatal crashes of the 737 Max, one in October 2018 and another in March 2019, resulted in 346 deaths and led to a 20-month grounding of the plane to address a design flaw. The company then encountered further scrutiny over the quality and safety of its planes, heightened after a door plug blew off a 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, prompting multiple federal investigations. Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges for deceiving the FAA during the Max’s initial investigation. As part of its agreement, Boeing will operate under a court-appointed monitor. While the strike will not affect consumer travel as delivered and currently in-use Boeing planes will continue flying, it will delay the delivery of jets to airlines, impacting Boeing’s primary revenue source. The company has not reported an annual profit since 2018, accumulating over $33 billion in core operating losses through the second quarter of this year, and its credit rating has dropped to near “junk” status. The company was not expected to become profitable soon due to production limits even before the strike. Boeing shares tank down Boeing’s shares have lost over 60% of their value in the past five years and more than 30% since the Alaska Air incident earlier this year. Holden initially described the tentative agreement as “the best contract we’ve negotiated in our history.” However, the strong backlash led him to revise his comments in recent days. He had previously told members that union leadership recommended accepting the deal as the best achievable without a strike and emphasized that the decision was ultimately up to the members. At a press conference following the vote announcement, Holden defended the union leadership’s recommendation, stating that the members had the final say and expressing pride in their decision to stand up for their needs. He acknowledged that members were seeking better job security, more time off, and higher wages due to rising prices and inflation. Holden also highlighted the dissatisfaction with the loss of the traditional pension plan and the stagnation of wages over the past decade. He noted that members were prepared to strike as long as necessary to secure a better deal. The recent wave of labor actions, including a significant strike by unionized US automakers that lasted seven weeks, has inspired Boeing workers. Holden noted that recent labor movement successes had given the union members confidence and motivated their current action.",

    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - About 35% of Americans said tipping culture in America is out of control, an increase of 5% over last year, according to a Bankrate study.\nTed Rossman with Bankrate said a lot of people are annoyed about pre-enter tip screens that pop up at coffee shops, food trucks, and elsewhere.\n“There’s a lot of tip creep that goes on as in being asked to tip in unconventional settings. And sometimes that leads to guilt tipping where you say yes even though you didn’t really want to,” Rossman explained. “And you hit 15 or 20% on the terminal. A lot of people leave feeling negative about these kinds of experiences. And a lot of people, about 4 in 10, think businesses should just pay their staff better.”\nInflation is a big part of the story, because people already feel squeezed. Prices are up, money is tight, and the tip is just one more thing – sort of a hidden surcharge – at the end of a purchase.\n“I do think we should separate places where we ought to be tipping like restaurants and hair salons and barber shops from places where it’s more optional,” Rossman shared. “I don’t think you always need to tip at the counter where you’re just picking up a sandwich or a coffee. But if you’re not tipping well at a restaurant that’s a big deal, because the federal tip minimum wage is $2.13 an hour.”\nRossman said waiters and waitresses rely on these tips. He said what surprised him most was that only a third of Gen-Zers who go to sit down restaurants are always tipping.\nHe noted only about half of millennials are always tipping at restaurants, whereas it’s much higher for the older generations: 78% of Gen X and 80% of Boomers.\nCopyright 2024 Gray DC.

    "title": "A Psychologist Explains How To ‘Strength Scan’ Your Relationship",
    "text": "A 2023 study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies found that “strength scanning” or recognizing a partner’s character strengths, such as their bravery, creativity, open-mindedness or kindness can improve the quality and happiness experienced in a romantic relationship.\nStrength scanning involves believing the best of a partner and focusing on what they do right rather than waiting for them to do something wrong. Researchers suggest that actively acknowledging and appreciating these strengths goes a long way in sustaining a healthy, long-term bond.\nHere are two ways strength scanning helps you bring out the best in your relationship.\n1. It Fuels Positive Illusions In A Relationship Positive illusions in a relationship refer to viewing one’s partner in an exceedingly positive light, often more positively than they see themselves and emphasizing their strengths, virtues and admirable attributes while maintaining a positive bias towards the thought of a successful future with them.\nThese positive illusions are generally considered healthy for relationships as they contribute to increased satisfaction and lower levels of conflict by fostering a more favorable view of one’s partner and the relationship as a whole. However, a balance between these positive illusions and a realistic understanding of one’s partner can co-exist and are essential for maintaining fulfilling relationships.\nMORE FOR YOU Ozempic And Wegovy Not Linked To Uptick In Suicidal Thoughts, Study Finds The Neuroscience Behind The Emotional Brain And The Thinking Brain A Psychologist Explains A ‘Psychologically Safe’ Workplace Scanning for a partner’s strengths in everyday interactions can fortify these realistic positive illusions of their character. For instance, when your partner talks about their workday, you might notice that they maintain great work-life boundaries, even though they have a heavy workload. “Scanning” for their strengths would mean reflecting on what it is about their character or their abilities that allows them to do this. This reflection could fuel the realistic and positive illusion that they are highly organized, assertive and confident.\nAccording to a 2019 study , positive illusions provide a sense of security and a willingness to invest in the relationship, helping partners handle relationship challenges and treat each other’s shortcomings with more kindness and understanding.\n2. It Enhances Mutual Well-Being Strength scanning benefits oneself, one’s partner and the longevity of a relationship. Research shows that when an individual’s strengths are valued, they experience greater well-being. Embodying higher levels of character strengths are also linked to greater marital satisfaction for both partners.\nAccording to a 2018 study , displaying higher levels of appreciation for a partner’s strengths is associated with experiencing greater commitment, investment and intimacy. It also allows individuals to view their relationships as spaces of personal growth, where they feel supported in pursuing their own life goals. On the other hand, focusing on the downside of a partner’s strengths, such as the tendency to stretch oneself too thin when extending emotional support, is linked to lower relationship satisfaction.\nResearchers found that acknowledging a partner's strengths can shape their behavior and allows them to also experience greater well-being and personal growth. It serves to amplify their confidence and self-worth, cultivating a culture of appreciation and provides them with feedback on which behaviors to continue or do away with.\nStrength scanning can also enhance “perceived partner responsiveness,” which refers to how understanding, validating and supportive a partner is perceived to be and significantly improves relationship satisfaction . Seeking out a partner’s strengths can make an individual more attuned to their levels of responsiveness and caring behavior as well as motivate them to be more appreciative and supportive of their partners.\nHow To Use Strength Scanning In A Relationship Here are three ways to start acknowledging a partner's strengths.\nEngage in active observation. Pay attention to your partner's actions, behaviors and achievements in everyday scenarios and consider what these instances reflect about their character. For instance, even a small moment such as a partner bringing you a cup of coffee before work displays the character strength of being loving and thoughtful. Express gratitude often. Verbalize your appreciation for their strengths. Celebrate their accomplishments, no matter how small. This shows an appreciation for their effort and abilities. A heartfelt “thank you for doing that” or “you’re amazing at that” can go a long way in reinforcing positive gestures. Encourage their growth. Support your partner’s pursuit of personal development and growth. Encouraging them to engage in endeavors that build and showcase their strengths is key to creating a positive cycle of strength scanning and genuine appreciation.\nConclusion When both partners actively highlight each other's strengths, it creates an environment where each individual feels seen and celebrated. Recognizing and acknowledging a partner's strengths reinforces the foundation of a relationship, fostering a deeper, more loving connection, effective communication and mutual growth.\nIf you are curious about your current level of relationship satisfaction, take this test: Relationship Satisfaction Scale\nMark Travers",

    "text": "Mental health advocate hosting town hall with DHHS CEO, interim Behavioral Health director LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - Because of the care and advocacy of one Lincoln man fighting for his brother, Nebraskans will have the chance to sit down with the Department of Health and Human Services top decision makers and share their stories and concerns about access to mental health resources. “I want people to come out to this because these people can’t speak for themselves,” Clay Anders said. “We have to do it and it’s our obligation and our duty to do that for the community.” 10/11 viewers first met Clay Anders in the documentary, [Suffering in Silence](https://www.1011now.com/2024/01/12/suffering-silence-1011-documentary-about-mental-health-crisis-response-lincoln/), which aired stories from the frontlines of the mental health response in Lincoln and surrounding communities. Anders is a primary care taker for his brother, who has schizophrenia and has struggled to stay out of the criminal justice system and access help. Anders said his brother is now in a residential treatment center and doing well. “I’m very encouraged right now,” Anders said. “And I’m very optimistic about, you know, the growth that’s coming from everything that we’re dealing with and where he was at and how they helped him.” His optimism isn’t just about his brother, but Anders’ wider impact on the community. That impact has brought him to the halls of the Nebraska State Capitol, where he’s connected with senators like Kathleen Kauth and Tony Vargas, who help Anders collect donations for his non-profit for at risk youth, [Honesty Project](https://www.honestyprojectinfo.com/). Kauth, after hearing Anders’ story about his brother, connected him with DHHS CEO Steve Corsi and Tony Green, the director of Developmental Disabilities and current interim Behavioral Health Division Director. “I have access to people and I can make a phone call and help make connections which once you make the connection with Clay, that’s that’s all it takes,” Kauth said. “He cares deeply about his brother and about all the other people in the community.” Anders’ had that talk with Corsi and Green earlier this year and now, he’s inviting more community members to speak with them on April 16. They’ll host a townhall meeting at the State Office building downtown. “It’ll be us all in a room with all these providers,” Anders said. “We’ll be expressing the concerns that we have any problems that we’re facing when it comes to policies and procedures on trying to get help. It’d be them explaining why certain funds aren’t being used right now and you know, how it could be appropriated in other places.” The townhall comes as the Nebraska Legislature approves the cutting of $15 million from DHHS’ budget. The department said this shouldn’t impact services, but Clay hopes to get more information about that money and more. “Especially because there’s a narrative right now that there’s no services in the State of Nebraska for the mentally ill or DD,” Anders said. “If that’s the case, then come say that. The only way things will change is if you voice what’s going on. If nobody knows what you’re dealing with, how can we fix it?” Anders said there’s space for 50 to 70 people to join the talk. They’re specifically looking for people who work in the behavioral health space. If interested in participating, email Anders at Canders@honestyprojectinfo.com or message Honesty Project on Facebook.
