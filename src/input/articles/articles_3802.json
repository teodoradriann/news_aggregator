Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below F34.SI WLMIY editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) March 1, 2024 at 12:10 AM · 3 min read In this article: Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below F34.SI Watchlist WLMIY\nWilmar International Limited ( SGX:F34 ) shareholders (or potential shareholders) will be happy to see that the Co-Founder, Khoon Hong Kuok, recently bought a whopping S$1.1m worth of stock, at a price of S$3.32. While that only increased their holding size by 0.08%, it is still a big swing by our standards.\nView our latest analysis for Wilmar International\nWilmar International Insider Transactions Over The Last Year Notably, that recent purchase by Co-Founder Khoon Hong Kuok was not the only time they bought Wilmar International shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of S$15m worth of shares at a price of S$3.69 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than S$3.32 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Khoon Hong Kuok.\nKhoon Hong Kuok bought 18.12m shares over the last 12 months at an average price of S$3.67. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\ninsider-trading-volume Wilmar International is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nInsider Ownership For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Wilmar International insiders own 6.8% of the company, worth about S$1.4b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nStory continues So What Do The Wilmar International Insider Transactions Indicate? The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Wilmar International. That's what I like to see! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

    "text": "Les syndicats représentants les travailleur.euse.s de la multinationale tiennent une journée d'action à travers le monde\nMONTRÉAL , le 13 sept. 2024 /CNW/ - Tous les syndicats représentant des travailleur.euse.s dans les différentes installations d'ArcelorMittal à travers le monde, réunis au sein du syndicat mondial IndustriALL, unissent leurs voix pour dénoncer le laxisme d'ArcelorMittal en santé et sécurité.\nOn a compté au moins 314 travailleur.euse.s décédé.e.s dans les installations d'ArcelorMittal depuis 2012, et les syndicats soupçonnent que ce nombre est sous-évalué.\n« Lorsqu'on échange entre les syndicats d'ArcelorMittal, on voit un pattern généralisé : les profits passent avant la santé et la sécurité des travailleurs. Résultat, des travailleur.euse.s perdent leur vie, d'autres sont blessés et on préfère demander aux travailleur.euse.s de porter des équipements de protection individuels plutôt que d'investir pour assainir les milieux de travail », dénonce le directeur québécois des Métallos, Dominic Lemieux .\nIl déplore notamment les retards dans les investissements à venir à l'usine de traitement du minerai de la mine du Mont-Wright à Fermont .\nPourtant, la multinationale avait consenti à créer un Comité conjoint global sur la santé et la sécurité en 2007, à la suite d'un accident qui a causé la mort de 41 mineurs au Kazakhstan . Mais celui-ci a cessé ses travaux en personne depuis la pandémie et n'a jamais repris ses travaux, pire, aucune inspection de site n'a eu lieu depuis.\nLes syndicats représentant les travailleur.euse.s d'ArcelorMittal à travers le monde, réunis au sein d'IndustriALL, considèrent que la compagnie « presse le citron de ses installations actuelles, plutôt que de moderniser et d'améliorer ses façons de faire pour mieux protéger la santé et sécurité. Cela mène à des accidents et des décès prévisibles et évitables. »\n« Cette attitude négligente doit cesser! », tonne le directeur québécois des Métallos, Dominic Lemieux . « La santé et la sécurité, ce n'est pas juste de faire porter des équipements de sécurité et de donner des petits discours d'encouragement au sujet des pratiques sécuritaires. Ça signifie aussi pour la compagnie de mettre la main à la poche pour améliorer réellement les environnements de travail. ArcelorMittal doit reprendre avec plus de sérieux le travail paritaire en santé et sécurité, localement et internationalement, avec les syndicats », conclut Dominic Lemieux .\nLe Syndicat des Métallos, affilié à la FTQ, est le plus important syndicat du secteur privé au Québec. Il regroupe plus de 60 000 travailleurs et travailleuses de tous les secteurs économiques.\nPour consulter nos communiqués : https://www.metallos.org/actualites-et-medias/actualites/\nPour suivre notre page Facebook : www.facebook.com/SyndicatDesMetallos/\nSOURCE Syndicat des Métallos (FTQ)\nCopyright 2024 Canada NewsWire",

    "title": "Inside Jaden McDuffie's Commitment: Why Northwestern Was The Right Fit",
    "text": "Jaden McDuffie didn't wait for the fall to make a decision.\nThe three-star wide receiver officially announced his commitment to Northwestern on May 22 via X, giving the program another promising piece in the Wildcats' 2026 recruiting class ahead of his senior season.\nThe Maryland native joins a Northwestern football program that is steadily building under head coach David Braun. McDuffie offers size and versatility as a wide receiver, with the coaching staff excited about his ability to make an impact on offense.\nMcDuffie was recruited by Northwestern wide receivers coach Armon Binns and ultimately chose the Wildcats over offers from schools including Air Force, Navy, Toledo, and Georgetown.\nBinns was instrumental in McDuffie's recruitment, with their relationship beginning through early conversations on social media.\n\"He hit me up and was like 'I love your tape' and we hopped on the phone and I felt a connection with him more than I have with most coaches,\" McDuffie said of the recruiting process. \"Everything felt free and fluid and he's also a Lakers fan, so that helped since we went through the playoff loss together.\"\nAs a LeBron James fan, McDuffie acknowledged he'll be entering Michael Jordan territory near Chicago and was adamant that James is the greatest of all-time, but will embrace the debate and is more than ready to fight for his guy.\n\"I'm prepared and I'll fight for my life for LeBron,\" McDuffie said. \"On my official visit, I was going to every single coach and I'll do that every day. I'll wake up at 6 am and text coach 'LeBron is better than Jordan' and whatever it takes, even if it's over the next four-to-five years, I'll be arguing for sure.\"\nAside from going back and forth with coaches and players on the LeBron vs. Jordan debate, McDuffie said the coaching staff, program culture, and the chance to play in the Big Ten were major factors in his decision.\n\"I don't see a better place for me than Northwestern as a high academic athlete,\" McDuffie said of his decision. \"It's the best of both worlds and it doesn't get better than that as you're playing in the Big Ten and you're on TV every weekend against the best competition and you get a chance to go to the league if you play well.\"\nWhile standing at 6-foot-3, McDuffie projects as a big-bodied outside receiver at the X position, but the Wildcats see more than just size. What stands out to the coaching staff is his ability to stretch the field and make plays over the middle — a role they discussed with him during his official visit.\n\"I feel like they want to stretch the field and have a big target guy with the ability to go across the middle of the field and make a play,\" McDuffie said of his fit within the offense. \"They said they want playmakers and guys who take advantage of the opportunities we give them. That sounds like stuff I can do.\"\nMcDuffie walked away from his visit with more than just a good feeling — he left with a plan.\nBraun, Binns, and offensive coordinator Zach Lujan outlined how McDuffie would be developed from day one, with a clear vision for his development over the first two seasons and a long-term plan that extends through all five years if he stays for a full college career.\n\"We mainly talked about where they see me for my freshman and sophomore year and how they're going to help me reach my potential,\" McDuffie said. \"Coach Bims in the meeting showed me where I would be and how I can make an impact. They really showed what they have in store for me and a plan for me to make it to the next level and become the best version of myself.\"\nComing off a breakout junior season at South River High School in Maryland, McDuffie caught 73 passes and set a school record with 1,251 receiving yards, adding 17 touchdowns over 10 games and averaging 125 yards per contest.\nHis jump in production from sophomore to junior year was significant — a leap he credits to both a shift in the team's offensive approach and his own physical development.\nMcDuffie said the team rarely threw the ball during his first two seasons, but that changed as a junior when the coaching staff expanded the playbook and made getting him more touches a priority.\nWith the passing game expanding, McDuffie quickly emerged as a key target and driving force behind the offense's progress. An offseason growth spurt only added to his ability to make an impact.\nReflecting on his development, McDuffie said he approached the game like a mathematician — constantly calculating where defenders would move and staying fully locked in while studying film.\n\"I hit my growth spurt and now I'm like 6-foot-3 now, but I took all aspects of my game to the next level and worked on my athletic ability,\" McDuffie said. \"I really wanted to work on my craft and just combine all aspects of my game from the years of playing football and it came out this year on the scene.\"\nWith his college decision behind him, McDuffie has one focus heading into his senior season: bringing home a state title.\n\"One thing I really want to do is win a state championship,\" he said. \"In my town, we're not really known as a football school, and I want to change that. A lot of kids in middle school think they have to go private to get noticed. So for my final year, I want to blow up, win a state championship, and show them you can stay home and still make it.\"",
