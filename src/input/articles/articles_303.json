    "text": "日前，以“跃见未来”为主题的第二十五届中国文旅论坛在青岛举办，在新征程上，迈向高质量发展的时代之门，共启智慧之旅。随着高考落幕，毕业旅行预订量如潮水般持续攀升。在智慧旅行盛行的当下，AI技术加速渗透旅游业，如何在“AI效率”与“人文温度”间寻得平衡，正成为业内深度思考的命题。\nAI大模型逐渐渗透旅游业\n当前，AI大模型正逐渐渗透到旅游行业。中国旅游研究院副院长唐晓云表示，“由AI支撑的新型人机协同旅游服务生产系统，正在改变旅游服务的生产方式和服务方式，以及游客的决策方式和出游方式。”\n从个人用户角度看，AI带来的普惠体验已贯穿“吃住行游购娱”全链条。在信息收集阶段，旅行者只需向AI智能体描述偏好，便能瞬间生成个性化行程方案。更能在行程中进行风险监控，如，当AI通过气象大数据感知到目的地即将出现极端天气时，会自动触发预警机制，同步提供新攻略等。\n在行业应用层面，AI大模型在酒店的渗透尤为显著。中国旅游研究院发布的《中国旅游住宿业发展报告2025》指出，AI技术已成为酒店提升运营效率与客户体验的核心驱动力。以引入智能前台系统的酒店为例，其可通过人脸识别将传统3分钟入住的流程压缩至15秒，同时，基于客人历史入住数据自动推送偏好服务。\nAI无法满足旅游业的服务核心\n从攻略生成到风险预警，从酒店运营到景区服务，AI大模型正以多元场景的渗透重新定义旅游业的服务边界。当技术普惠与人文体验在数据洪流中找到平衡点，这场智能变革终将推动行业迈向更高效、更个性的新维度。\n在民宿办理入住时，店主递来的一杯温热清茶里蕴含的地域人情；导游在讲解历史遗迹时，因亲历故事而泛起的眼角微光；旅途中偶遇的当地人热情指引的巷弄美食……这些无法被AI代码量化的情感交互，才是构成游客记忆图谱的灵魂碎片。\n“服务是旅游的核心。有温度的服务是传统旅游服务的关键优势，这一点很难为AI所替代。社交需求、情绪价值是游客参与旅游活动的重要动机之一，这些目前是AI无法提供的。”中国旅游研究院副院长唐晓云如是说。\n“AI效率”与“人文温度”之间需平衡\n在AI技术深度渗透旅游业的当下，如何在效率与温度间构建动态平衡，成为行业破局的关键命题。\n在服务定位层面，需建立清晰的AI与人工服务边界。如，当老年游客在古镇景区迷路时，AI巡逻机器人能规划最优路线，同时，人工向导在带领过程中，可穿插讲解巷弄里的历史，技术指路与人文引路的组合让服务既有效率又具温度。\n人机协同的效能提升，依赖行业人员与AI的技能适配升级。如酒店前台员工需掌握AI前台系统的深层操作逻辑，挖掘客人的潜在需求后，在AI推荐标准房型的同时，人工同步补充“该房型可加床，适合带宠物入住”等个性化建议。\n数据应用层面平衡关键在于让技术收集与人文解读形成闭环。如在文旅系统内，通过AI分析游客消费数据，识别出“亲子家庭高频购买手工体验券”的行为模式，而运营团队则从人文视角解读数据背后的需求，据此，策划出“非遗手作亲子挑战赛”，将消费数据转化为场景设计。\n唯有在技术理性与人文感性的交织中寻找平衡点，旅游业才能既享受智能时代的效率红利，又守护好“人在旅途”的情感本质。",

    "text": "TULSA, Okla. (KTUL) — For those looking to find a warm shelter during these dangerously cold temperatures, organizations across Green Country are stepping up to help those in need. \"It's open to the community, regardless of status. We have heat going on 24/7,\" said Alex Uribe, Assistant Pastor at Kingdom Living Muskogee. With the dangerously cold weather, warming stations across Green Country are answering the call. \"Anytime it's below about 30 degrees, we try to open up and provide shelter for anyone. We have cots,\" said Uribe. One of those warming stations is Kingdom Living Church in Muskogee. \"Right now, we got about 10 people in here. But we were able to house about 100,\" said Uribe. Uribe says it was important to open the warming station after the unfortunate loss of life. \"Last week, we had two people pass from the cold prior to us opening up. So, you know, we just want to ensure that people have a safe, warm place to go. And that no one's suffering through this time,\" said Uribe. Another shelter in Muskogee, the Gospel Rescue Mission, and B the Light Mission in Bartlesville say in weather events like this one, it's important to do what they can for their communities. \"We exist in order to help individuals in our community to flourish, and our community cannot flourish while there are men and women dying on our sidewalks of our businesses,\" said Rich Schaus, the Executive Director of The Gospel Rescue Mission. \"We wanted them all to survive and to flourish,\" said Schaus. \"We give them a hot shower, change of clothes, and give them warm meals and hot coffee and some of them choose to stay and some of them choose to leave,\" said Christy McPhail, Co-Founder of B the Light Mission. \"Those that want to be helped, we're going to be there for them,\" said McPhail. Kingdom Living Muskogee is located at 120 N 24th St. in Muskogee, and you can donate or volunteer at Kingdom Living Muskogee by going to their location. The Gospel Rescue Mission is located at 323 Callahan St. in Muskogee, and you can donate or volunteer by going to their [website](https://www.grmmuskogee.org/), or by calling (918) 682-3489. B the Light Mission is located at 219 N. Virginia Ave. in Bartlesville, and you can sign up to donate or volunteer by going to their [website.](https://b-thelight.org/) Each of these stations is open 24/7. If you want to help, these stations say you can by volunteering or donating.",
