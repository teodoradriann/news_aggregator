    "text": "随着天气逐渐转暖，鄂尔多斯市春季造林绿化工作已全面拉开序幕，苗木培育、平茬灌木等工作全面开始。\n  3月12日，在鄂尔多斯市乌审旗乌兰陶勒盖镇红旗村，村民姚世发正忙碌地为即将出售的苗木做最后的准备工作。“从上周开始，对100亩苗木陆续进行灌水，大概5天之后开始起苗，预计4月初就能全部起完。这批苗木总数超过1000万株，预计能得到30多万元的利润。” 据姚世发介绍说。\n  乌审旗作为鄂尔多斯市生态建设的重要区域，近年来积极响应国家号召，大力推动苗木培育工作。从2023年开始，乌审旗政府鼓励农牧户培育适宜本地气候和土壤的苗木品种，如杨柴、柠条、樟子松等。截至目前，乌审旗已累计培育苗木1.2亿株，其中冬季平茬沙柳面积达到120万亩，可产出铺设沙障材料60万吨。这些苗木将完全满足乌审旗“三北”工程全年的任务需求。\n  乌审旗林业和草原局产业管理办公室负责人柴彦军表示：“目前全旗累计培育1.2亿株苗木，为‘三北’工程的顺利推进提供了有力保障。目前，我们争取了保障性苗圃项目，预计育苗量可达5000万株，这将进一步巩固我们的生态建设成果。”\n  与此同时，灌木平茬工作也在紧锣密鼓地进行中。在乌审旗苏力德苏木通史嘎查，牧民满都拉承包了1.6万亩的灌木平茬任务。三台机械在毛乌素沙地上穿梭作业，平茬下来的灌木条被制作成可燃烧的生物质颗粒和可饲喂的高蛋白饲料，实现了生态效益和经济效益的双赢。\n  这些年，鄂尔多斯市作为黄河“几字弯”攻坚战的主战场和主阵地，扛起防沙治沙的政治责任，通过整合资金、人力和技术，统筹推进锁边林带锁沙、联防联治阻沙、光伏项目治沙、孔兑治理拦沙、草原提升防沙等一系列举措，科学推进防沙治沙和国土绿化，大力实施生态修复项目。截至目前，“三北”工程六期重点项目建设取得了标志性成果，库布其沙漠治理率达到40%，毛乌素沙地治理率更是高达80%。\n  据鄂尔多斯市林业和草原局治沙造林科科长格希格图介绍，目前全市育苗总量已达9.97亿株，能够满足全年沙化土地治理任务的需求。同时，平茬下来的沙柳作为工程固沙的主要原材料，也已储备了170万吨，足以满足160万亩工程固沙的需要。（记者 布音额尼尔乐）\n【纠错】",

    "title": "Massachusetts considers trust funds for state's poorest newborns to help 'shrink the racial wealth gap'",
    "text": "Massachusetts is considering trust funds, aimed at reducing the racial wealth gap, for the state's poorest newborns that the recipients would be able to access when they turn 18. The \"baby bonds\" would be an at-birth publicly funded trust fund program for Massachusetts residents , to be used for college, buying a home or starting a business. The amount given to each eligible newborn would depend on their household income, although it doesn't give a maximum amount or specify who would qualify for the funds. \"Children born into households with low income (which are disproportionately households of color) are prioritized through eligibility requirements set by the state or through a progressive allocation system, with those with the lowest income receiving the largest investments,\" the Massachusetts state government says on its website. \"This is to provide the most support to children born with the least resources, and to shrink the racial wealth gap.\" VA GOV. YOUNGKIN SAYS BUDGET PROPOSAL PRIORITIZES EARLY LEARNING AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS Newborn babies in a hospital nursery. (ER Productions Limited via Getty Images) The trust funds aim to narrow the racial wealth gap in Massachusetts, as well as increase \"access to financial education, closing the race and gender wage gap, addressing racial equity, expanding college affordability , and promoting STEM education.\"The program could cost the state roughly $52 million annually with an estimated 8,000 infants qualifying each year in Massachusetts, The Boston Globe reported . In March 2022, the State Treasurer Deborah Goldberg announced at the Economic Empowerment Trust Fund board meeting that she was convening a task force to explore the creation of Baby Bonds in Massachusetts. Goldberg told The Globe that officials have not yet identified a funding source for the program, but that it will \"hopefully… be a priority\" that \"will receive the kind of funding it needs.\"Democratic state Sen. Paul R. Feeley, who introduced the bill in Massachusetts, said the trust funds would \"build wealth from the bottom up,\" putting poorer people \"on a trajectory for real opportunity from day one,\" The Daily Mail reported . WISCONSIN GOV. EVERS FINDS $170M IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO CONTINUE COVID-ERA CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES \"By investing at the start of a child's life, we are providing a jump-start to individuals otherwise at a disadvantage by beginning to narrow the racial wealth gap and giving our most vulnerable residents a fighting shot at the middle class and the American Dream,\" Feeley said. A national version of the law is currently stalled in Congress. (iStock) A national version of the law, the American Opportunity Accounts Act, which has stalled in Congress, proposes giving each child a $1,000 seed deposit at birth, followed by annual deposits of up to $2,000 based on their parents' income. Children from the lowest-income families could accrue $46,215 by the time they turn 18, while qualifying families in the highest income bracket could accrue around $1,681, according to the Daily Mail. THREE MILLION CHILDREN SET TO LOSE CHILD CARE WITH EXPIRATION OF FEDERAL FUNDING In Connecticut, which has its own infant trust fund, low-income babies are given a one-time deposit of $3,200, which is held in the bonds and accrues interest until they are 18, according to Massachusetts Baby Bonds task force findings . In Washington, D.C., any child born in the district on or after October 1, 2021, to a family enrolled in Medicaid with an income of 300% of the Federal Poverty Line, is eligible to receive an initial deposit of at least $500. Similarly, California approved a trust fund of up to $8,000 each for children who lost a parent or guardian to COVID-19. Baby bond proposals are also under consideration in Iowa, New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

    "text": "A severed fibreoptic cable is behind a mobile phone and internet outage across large parts of Golden Bay, in Tasman, which has also affected 111 calls since early this morning.\nIt comes as the Tasman region extended a state of emergency for another week after it was besieged by rain and floods at the weekend and was on Thursday expecting more heavy rain.\nChorus technicians found a fault on a fibre line running over Takaka Hill caused by a slip, that resulted in an estimated 1150 households in Golden Bay losing internet and mobile coverage for most of Thursday.\nTechnicians found a severed cable at Uruwhenua Bridge on State Highway 60 and were currently working to repair it and restore services, including emergency calls to the 111 system.\nChorus said the fault impacted 350 copper connections and 800 fibre connections.\nIt brought in technicians from other areas to help find the fault as quickly as possible in difficult weather conditions.\n\"Our field teams have quickly mobilised to the fault site and are working to identify the cause of the outage,\" it said in a statement on Thursday.\n\"Priority will be given to faults that affect multiple customers or involve medical or emergency needs.\n\"Additionally, because Chorus' fibre network supports many of New Zealand's mobile towers, restoring mobile coverage is also a focus.\"\nChorus apologised to affected customers for the inconvenience caused by the outage and said it appreciated everyone's patience while it worked to restore connections as quickly and safely as possible.\n\"While we are focused on restoring affected connections quickly, our priority is the health and safety of our staff, contractors and the public.\"\nNelson Tasman Emergency Management said earlier on Thursday it was aware of the fault on the Chorus communications network and advised anyone with an emergency to still try ringing 111.\n\"Currently, the 111 network is intermittent as the issue is being worked on, and we hope it will be resolved soon but, in the meantime, if you have an emergency please keep trying.\n\"People should still try to call 111 if their mobile network is down.\"\nThe Telecommunications Forum chief executive Paul Brislen said people with no cell phone coverage in Tasman should still try to call 111 if they needed to in an emergency, because another mobile network provider might carry the call.\n\"There's no damage to any of cell phone towers or to the power supply so once that fibre fix is completed that should reconnect all of those phones and all of those cell phone towers,\" he said.\nCivil Defence said Golden Bay residents should ask a neighbour for help in an emergency if they can't get through to 111.\nCivil Defence controller Alec Louverdis said with the fault now being worked on it was expected a temporary fix should be in place before the end of the day.\nHe said there were few alternatives to calling 111 for people who needed emergency services.\nTo make temporary repairs contractors would have to use an excavator which meant there might be some interruptions to traffic, however traffic management will be in place.\n\"In the meantime, if you do have an emergency situation and can do so safely, make your way to the Takaka Fire Station which is staffed and has resources and communications.\"\nThe Tasman District Council said on Facebook it was aware of the fault and reassured residents the situation was being resolved as quickly as possible.\nMeanwhile Emergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell said he had asked his officials to work closely with Chorus to restore the services for Golden Bay.\nHe said a lot of planning had been done in preparation for the weather and he expected to be heading back to Tasman tomorrow, \"depending on what unfolds in the next few hours\".\n\"The constant message is: please don't go into flood waters because they are dangerous,\" Mitchell said.\n\"Update yourself regularly on information, and please follow any instructions, especially from our first responders, or even if there are contractors and road workers out there and they block a road. They're doing it for a reason.\"\nMitchell said the government's focus was on the immediate response but was also assessing what additional support would be required.\nSign up for Ngā Pitopito Kōrero, a daily newsletter curated by our editors and delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",
