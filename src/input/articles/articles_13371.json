    "text": "Expanded age ratings for apps and an easier process to create a 'Child Account' Apple's bolstering its parental controls and child account experience\nLater in 2025, global age ratings will be expanded, and you can convert any standard account to a child account\nThere is also a new API designed to help customize the in-app experience by age\nApple has long offered parental controls on devices and child accounts but is now making some changes to bolster its offering and make it a safer experience for all parties involved. Some of these adjustments are on the end user's side, such as creating a child account and App Store adjustments, but several are on the developer's side, in the form of API changes.\nThe new features and functionality were shared in a new whitepaper titled \"Helping Protect Kids Online,\" which you can read in full here. The changes begin with streamlining the process of creating a child account. As seen in the latest betas for iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, Apple now allows you to select an age range when creating an account; once selected, this information informs the presets for parental controls.\nOf course, creating the account adds your child as a user and allows for family sharing of iCloud services and purchases within the App Store. However, to streamline the process, you can still give the child access to the new device with more limited functionality if you want to complete the rest of the account setup later.\n(Image credit: Future)\nLikely even more important, and good news for some, is that later in 2025, Apple will let you update the age on an Apple Account. This way, if you input the wrong date of birth, you can adjust it. Apple requires that kids under 13 have a Child Account associated with a parental Apple ID in the United States. Those under 18 can choose to be set up this way for these advanced protections, and some presets.\nThe App Store experience currently offers four age ratings worldwide, two of them being 12+ and 17+. Apple aims to create a more curated, safe experience and will expand the global age…\nJacob Krol",

    "text": "MONTREAL — A union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers has reached a deal in principle with the government and is ending a strike that has shut around 800 schools since Nov. 23.\nFédération autonome de l’enseignement — or FAE — said Thursday night on social media that it spent the day analyzing a tentative deal with the province and will recommend it to its members for approval during general assemblies after the holidays. Details of the agreement have not been released.\nEven though the FAE called the deal \"a new step,\" it emphasized \"it is up to the teachers to respond to (Premier) François Legault's government and to say whether they feel they have been heard.\"\nThe union said it has ended all of its pressure tactics, such as the general strike that has shut 800 schools, including in Montreal, since the end of November. If students affected by the FAE strike return to school as scheduled in January, they will have been away from classes for almost seven consecutive weeks.\nThe FAE, which represents more than 66,000 teachers, took the most hard line out of all the public sector unions negotiating new contracts with the government when it launched an unlimited general strike.\nEarlier today, the government announced it had reached tentative deals on salaries with an alliance of unions, excluding the FAE, representing 420,000 public sector employees, including teachers and health-care workers. They had walked out sporadically since November, for a total of 11 days.\nThe only major labour group without any sort of agreement is a nurses union with about 80,000 members — Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec — which said today that negotiations are ongoing.\nEarlier Thursday, before the FAE announced the end to its strike, Sylvain Martel, spokesman for parents group Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec, said he was feeling optimistic but remaining cautious that 800 schools would reopen after the holiday break.\n\"We're glad that we're able to hope for going back to school on Jan. 9, but everything is tentative, lots of people have to agree to what's on the table, so let's hope that it's a real deal and (union) members will get what they want,\" he said in an interview.\nMartel said discussions have been taking place between teachers, parents and administrators about how children will catch up after missing so much school. How that happens will vary, he said, because the effects of the strikes were unequal — some parents taught their children at home, others hired tutors, but many less-fortunate students spent weeks with little to no learning at all.\n\"It's very difficult for students to go back to the same rhythm they were in November, so it's going to take a little while, but we'll get there,\" he said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "title": "Northrop Grumman’s Scott Willoughby ’89 to Address Graduates at Lehigh’s 156th Undergraduate Commencement | Lehigh University",
    "text": "Scott Willoughby ’89, who oversaw the development of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) and was recently elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), will deliver the address at Lehigh’s 156th undergraduate spring commencement on Sunday, May 19, 2024. “It’s an honor to return to Lehigh and speak to graduates at Commencement,” Willoughby said. “As a proud Lehigh engineering alum, I look forward to sharing with graduates the foundations the university built for my life and career. I am excited to be celebrating this milestone with the graduates poised to embark on the next chapter of their lives.” Lehigh President Joseph J. Helble ’82 said: “I am thrilled to welcome Scott to campus to address our graduates. The university community is looking forward to hearing how Lehigh laid the foundation for his remarkable career as a pioneer in the development of instrumentation to explore the deep reaches of space, and I know our graduating students will draw from his thoughtful insights.” A cosmic time machine in the making Willoughby is senior vice president of performance excellence at Northrop Grumman's space systems sector and former vice president program manager for the James Webb Telescope program at Northrop Grumman, a leading global aerospace and defense technology company that served as prime contractor on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. On Dec. 25, 2021, Webb, an international collaboration among NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, launched from Kourou, French Guiana after decades in the making. Willoughby, who oversaw the Webb project for more than 12 years, led the Northrop Grumman industry team that designed, built, completed its integration, tested its state-of-the-art scientific instruments and prepared the observatory for launch. Considered an engineering marvel and the world’s most powerful space telescope ever built, many new technologies were invented to achieve Webb’s pioneering capabilities. To design, build, test and launch Webb, a global endeavor was needed to make its historic mission a reality. The Northrop Grumman industry team led by Willoughby in partnership with NASA enlisted over 14 countries, three space agency to include NASA, the Canadian Space Agency and the European Space Agency, 400 companies and suppliers, and 300 universities and science organizations. “Webb is truly a cosmic time machine, it allows humanity an unprecedented view of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed billions of years ago,” said Willoughby. “Webb helps us answer fundamental questions like are we alone? and, where did we come from?” A Pioneering Career in Space Willoughby is a first-generation college graduate whose engineering career was made possible through his determination and Lehigh’s robust alumni network. After graduating Lehigh, Willoughby considered relocating to California, where his brother was then living. He combed through Lehigh’s alumni directories, searching for electrical engineers, and reached out to several, asking to meet with them to discuss a career in engineering. An alum who was working at TRW, now Northrop Grumman, helped Willoughby make a connection there. That launched his career in engineering, which now spans more than three decades. Prior to his work on Webb, Willoughby served in several leadership roles at Northrop Grumman. His responsibilities ranged from financial and contract management, testing, integration, production and management in various national security space programs. NASA, NAE Honors and the Collier Trophy Earlier this year, Willoughby was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in recognition of “engineering leadership enabling the deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope,” according to a press release from the NAE. Election to the NAE is an elite distinction; Willoughby is among 114 new members and 21 new international members announced on Feb. 6, 2024. There are now 2,310 U.S. members and 332 international members, according to the NAE. In 2023, Willoughby, along with NASA and the Northrop Grumman industry team, received the Robert J. Collier Trophy for ‘revolutionizing the field of astrophysics with the team’s pioneering design and exceptional performance.’ The Collier Trophy is the most prestigious national recognition in the aerospace industry. Past recipients of the trophy include: Orville Wright (1911), Howard Hughes (1938), Neil Armstrong (1969), the B-2 (1991), Global Hawk (2000), SpaceShipOne (2004) and the X-47B (2013). Willoughby also received NASA’s Distinguished Public Service Medal in 2022 for his work on Webb. According to NASA, the medal “recognizes personal contributions to NASA mission success…through extraordinary service and a profound level of excellence.” It is NASA’s highest honor. Philanthropic Initiatives Willoughby, whose Lehigh education was possible due to a scholarship, has consistently given back to his alma mater. He and his wife established in 2021 the Sarah and Scott P. Willoughby ’89 Endowed Scholarship Fund. Willoughby described himself during his high school and college years as a “rebel” with a somewhat unclear academic path, someone who needed guidance. He found that at Lehigh. Willoughby said he and Sarah created the scholarship fund in the hopes that it would provide support to a deserving student who wouldn’t have the opportunity to attend Lehigh otherwise. The scholarship was endowed last academic year and was awarded to the first recipient. “I learned to always pay it forward and help a student who has the tenacity to reach their dreams and accomplish whatever goal they set forth,” Willoughby said. “I have one criterion for this scholarship: that it goes to a student who needs it.” An advocate for education, Willoughby has also generously donated to other financial aid and student support initiatives and volunteered his time speaking to Lehigh classes. He has met with other first-generation students like himself and gave students tours of Webb while it was being constructed. In addition to his Lehigh degree, Willoughby holds a master’s degree from the University of Southern California. He also is a graduate of the UCLA Executive Program at the Anderson School.

    "title": "Vienen buenos tiempos y de mucho trabajo en materia de seguridad con Omar García Harfuch | El Heraldo de México",
    "text": "Uno de los nombramientos más esperados en el gabinete legal que integra la doctora Claudia Sheinbaum, fue sin duda el del titular de la Secretaria de Seguridad y Protección Ciudadana. Incluso, podríamos decir, que se esperaba con cierta morbosidad, por aquello de lo que afirmaban los detractores de la 4T, de que Omar García Harfuch no estaba en el animo del Presidente de la República y el designaría a los responsables de las carteras más importantes del nuevo Gobierno. La nominación envía dos mensajes contundentes, por un lado, la autodeterminación de la Presidenta electa y por otro, el de un cambio sustantivo en el modelo de seguridad, que seguirá fortaleciéndose con la atención a las causas que incuban la delincuencia, con procesos de investigación y tecnología ampliados y mejorados, además de una nueva relación con los ciudadanos. Como lo hizo en la ciudad de México el hoy Senador electo y virtual Secretario federal. No obstante, muchos expertos han coincidido en los retos que implica pasar a una fase superior en esta materia, armonizando el “Abrazos no balazos” con una respuesta decisiva, para ejercer el monopolio de la fuerza pública contra los carteles de la delincuencia y los miembros del crimen organizado que dañan con impunidad a la sociedad en su conjunto. Desde la óptica de diversos conocedores del tema, entre ellos el doctor José Enrique Vallarta, el diseño estructural de la SSPC requiere de ajustes y cambios que coadyuven a la obtención de mejores resultados y una percepción positiva en la sociedad mexicana. Dentro de las áreas de oportunidad que se visualizan, una fundamental, es el fortalecimiento de la colaboración operativa entre la SSPC y la Guardia Nacional, redefiniendo una estrategia de coordinación entre estos dos órganos del Estado que garanticen mejores resultados en las esferas de inteligencia, investigación y seguridad en carreteras. Por otro lado, se requiere la modernización y el rediseño de áreas y de Órganos Administrativos desconcentrados, adscritos a la Secretaria federal, por ejemplo, el de la Unidad de Prevención de la Violencia y el Delito; el de la Unidad de Políticas y Estrategias para la Construcción de la Paz con Entidades Federativas y Regiones; el de la Unidad de Información, Infraestructura Informática y Vinculación Tecnológica; El del Centro Nacional de Información, Plataforma México; El del Centro Nacional de Inteligencia; El del Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública y el de la Coordinación Nacional Anti homicidios. En ese mismo tenor, se sugiere la creación de un Sistema Nacional de Inteligencia, con el objetivo de proveer a las fiscalías y fuerzas de seguridad, de una base de datos confiables, que contengan información antidelictiva. También, para coadyuvar en el fortalecimiento y la coordinación de las distintas instituciones de procuración de justicia del país. Otro rubro en el que se necesita incidir es el de la Modernización Normativa de la SSPC, esto, en lo que compete a la actualización del Reglamento Interior de la Secretaria, expedido el 30 de abril de 2019, pues existen disparidades entre la estructura actual y la normatividad vigente. De igual manera, se propone la actualización de la Estrategia Nacional de Seguridad Pública, expedida el 16 de mayo de 2019, que no incluyó diversos temas de seguridad contemporáneos como la ciberseguridad. Así mismo, se plantea la modernización de Leyes y Reglamentos de los Órganos Administrativos Desconcentrados adscritos a la SSPC. En este sentido, se formula la modernización de los que corresponden a la Guardia Nacional (GN), al Servicio de Protección Federal (SPF), al Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública (SESNSP) y al Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI), con objeto, que correspondan a su operación, diseño institucional y funcionamiento operativo vigente. Otro ámbito a fortalecer es la vinculación con organizaciones y organismos ciudadanos, así como con los diversos observatorios de seguridad ciudadanos. Por supuesto y de gran relevancia será el fortalecimiento de los vínculos con asociaciones, cámaras y organismos empresariales para atender las problemáticas sobre extorsión, seguridad en carreteras, seguridad y desarrollo rural, ciberseguridad, y seguridad turística, entre otras. Un pendiente más es el rediseño de la política penitenciaria en materia de reinserción social, así como los programas y acciones que deriven de ésta, aplicables en los Centros Penitenciarios Federales. Por si fuese poco, al Congreso de la Unión, tocará hacer reformas a Leyes sustantivas en materia de seguridad y promulgación de nuevas disposiciones normativas, como la Ley General del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad; La Ley General de Seguridad Privada; La Ley General de Extorsión y La Ley General de Ciberseguridad. Ardua tarea tendrá el Secretario Omar García Harfuch en cuanto tome posesión de su cargo, afortunadamente al empuje de su juventud le precede la experiencia en Dependencias federales y su éxito como Secretario de Seguridad Ciudadana en la ciudad de México.
