    "title": "Susceptibility to febrile malaria is associated with an inflammatory gut microbiome",
    "text": "Malaria is a major public health problem, but many of the factors underlying the pathogenesis of this disease are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate in Malian children that susceptibility to febrile malaria following infection with Plasmodium falciparum is associated with the composition of the gut microbiome prior to the malaria season. Gnotobiotic mice colonized with the fecal samples of malaria-susceptible children had a significantly higher parasite burden following Plasmodium infection compared to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the fecal samples of malaria-resistant children. The fecal microbiome of the susceptible children was enriched for bacteria associated with inflammation, mucin degradation, gut permeability and inflammatory bowel disorders (e.g., Ruminococcus gauvreauii, Ruminococcus torques, Dorea formicigenerans, Dorea longicatena, Lachnoclostridium phocaeense and Lachnoclostridium sp. YL32). However, the susceptible children also had a greater abundance of bacteria known to produce anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids and those associated with favorable prognosis and remission following dysbiotic intestinal events (e.g., Anaerobutyricum hallii, Blautia producta and Sellimonas intestinalis). Metabolomics analysis of the human fecal samples corroborated the existence of inflammatory and recovery-associated features within the gut microbiome of the susceptible children. There was an enrichment of nitric oxide-derived DNA adducts (deoxyinosine and deoxyuridine) and long-chain fatty acids, the absorption of which has been shown to be inhibited by inflamed intestinal epithelial cells, and a decrease in the abundance of mucus phospholipids. Nevertheless, there were also increased levels of pseudouridine and hypoxanthine, which have been shown to be regulated in response to cellular stress and to promote recovery following injury or hypoxia. Overall, these results indicate that the gut microbiome may contribute malaria pathogenesis and suggest that therapies targeting intestinal inflammation could decrease malaria susceptibility.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "El martes 30 de enero, el presidente de Ecuador, Daniel Noboa, manifestó que su gobierno no reconocerá los resultados de las elecciones de Venezuela, que hasta el momento no tienen fecha definida, por considerar que estas no serán ‘legales’, esto por la inhabilitación María Corina Machado.\nPero el anuncio de Noboa no cayó muy bien en el actual presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro, en un discurso ofrecido este miércoles 31 de enero, le respondió a Noboa y le hizo una clara amenaza.\n“Estás amenazando a Venezuela desde Ecuador, Noboa. No le abras las puertas de tu país al diablo, y te digo algo que es peor, piénsalo bien cuando te vas a meter con Venezuela. Mírame a los ojos, el que se mete con Venezuela se seca y te vas a secar, deja de meterte con nosotros”, dijo sin tapujos Nicolás Maduro durante el acto de instalación del año judicial en Caracas, la capital venezolana.\nNicolás Maduro.\n“No te conozco, Noboa, eres muy joven (…) tienes que estar preocupado por tu país, que no gobiernas tu país, que llegaste a abrirle las puerta al Comando Sur, al diablo, ocúpate de tu país que tienes un berenjenal y no sabes qué hacer”, sentenció.\nLa declaración de Nicolás Maduro causó revuelo a través de las diferentes redes sociales, en especial en X, antes conocida mundialmente como Twitter. Claramente, las palabras del mandatario venezolano fueron rechazadas por muchas personas en el Sur de América.\nCondenan inhabilitaciones en Venezuela La Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH) afirmó este miércoles que las inhabilitaciones políticas en Venezuela “son propias de regímenes autoritarios” y contribuyen a un “ambiente de persecución” que desalienta el voto.\nEn un comunicado, este órgano de la Organización de los Estados Americanos (OEA) condenó un fallo del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (TSJ) de Venezuela que levantó temporalmente las inhabilitaciones de varios líderes de la oposición pero mantuvo la de Henrique Capriles y la de María Corina Machado.\nNicolás Maduro.\nEsta última arrasó en las elecciones primarias de la principal alianza opositora, con más de 2,4 millones de votos. Las inhabilitaciones en contra de opositores “son propias de regímenes autoritarios”, sostiene la CIDH, que llama al gobierno del mandatario venezolano Nicolás Maduro a “adoptar medidas dirigidas a reconstruir la democracia y garantizar la participación política”.\nEstas decisiones “acaban por contribuir a un ambiente de persecución que desalientan la participación ciudadana en asuntos de interés público”, se queja la organización. En los últimos días 36 personas, entre civiles y militares, fueron detenidas en Venezuela, incluidos tres colaboradores de Machado, a quienes las autoridades vinculan con cinco “conspiraciones” para asesinar a Maduro.\nLa Comisión denuncia un patrón que incluye “detenciones arbitrarias de dirigentes opositores y sindicalistas, proyectos legislativos que restringen el funcionamiento de las asociaciones civiles, declaraciones estigmatizantes por parte de altas autoridades del Estado y actos intimidatorios”.\nEl sistema judicial venezolano “no ofrece garantías de independencia e imparcialidad” y “ha jugado un rol significativo en la represión de opositores”, denuncia la CIDH. Se basa en que ha apartado de los comicios a “reconocidos dirigentes de la oposición”, con lo que “anula la posibilidad de desarrollar elecciones presidenciales libres, justas y competitivas”.\nComo consecuencia, el organismo llama a adoptar “con urgencia” medidas “para restablecer la separación e independencia del sistema judicial y demás poderes” con el fin de “reconstruir la democracia”.\n*Con información de AFP.",

Epub 2024 Jan 23. PMID:\n38262071\nRaimundo Pereira Miranda Neto\nCONTEXT: Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has been widely used to improve strength, fatigue resistance and increase muscle mass in healthy individuals. These effects could help critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) who show reduced mobility and muscle strength. ICU-acquired weakness lessens overall health and increases the patient's length of stay in the ICU.\nOBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effects of PBMT using low intensity light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the mobility and muscle strength (functional capacity) and length of stay of patients admitted to hospital ICU.\nMETHODS: This randomized, triple-blind, sham-controlled trial was conducted in a hospital ICU. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to two equal groups: (a) PBMT and (b) Sham. PBMT was applied daily to patients until their discharge from the ICU, using a flexible neoprene array of 264 LEDs (120 at 635 nm, 1.2 mW each; 144 at 880 nm, 15 mW each) for 90s (207.36 Joules) at each site. Ten sites were located bilaterally on the thighs, legs, arms, and forearms ventrally and dorsally, 15 min totaling 2,073.6 Joules per session. Outcomes were length of stay (in h) until discharge from the ICU, muscle strength by the Medical Research Council (MRC) score and handgrip dynamometry (HGD), patient mobility by Intensive Care Unit Mobility Scale (IMS) and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) for predicting mortality of patients admitted to the ICU.\nRESULTS: PBMT reduced the average length of stay in the ICU by ~30% (p = 0.028); increased mobility (IMS: 255% vs. 110% p = 0.007), increased muscle strength (MRC: 12% vs. -9% p = 0.001) and HGD (34% vs. -13% p < 0.001), and the SAPS3 score was similar (p > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that daily PBMT can reduce the length of stay of ICU patients and increase muscle strength and mobility.\n[Laser Treatment: Low-Level : CK(1872) : AC(312)](/therapeutic-action/laser-treatment-low-level), [Light Therapy: Red Colored : CK(421) : AC(53)](/therapeutic-action/light-therapy-red-colored)",
