    "title": "Walmart recalls magnetic balls after CPSC warns of choking and injury hazards - Local News 8",
    "text": "By Ramishah Maruf, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Regulators have issued a recall for high-powered magnetic balls after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission issued several warnings for the toy kits, citing the risk of injury or even death.\nWalmart recalled the “Relax 5mm Science Kit, Large Hematite Magnets Magnetic Stones Building Blocks,” sold exclusively on the site through Joybuy.\nEarlier in December, CPSC said these magnets, often marketed for children, are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s small parts cylinder (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.”\nThe agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States.\nThe recall affects about 4,240 units. The CPSC said customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

This phenomenon can then lead to abdominal cramps, a feeling of bloating, constipation and can even make you sick, all factors that can discourage you from eating.\nVIDEO – Dr Christian Recchia: “It is the second most common and deadliest cancer”\nThe second most common cancer\nIntestinal cancer ranks second among the most common cancers. However, there is no need to panic because in 95% of cases, it can be cured if the diagnosis is early, hence the importance of monitoring your body and knowing the different symptoms. As a reminder, one of the most important and common is the presence of blood in the stools.\nALSO READ >> Be careful, this drink can double your risk of bowel cancer\nSo to avoid any unpleasant surprises and complications, it is strongly recommended to be monitored from the age of 50. As Dr Christian Recchia recalled for Yahoo, paraclinical examinations “extremely precise” are indicated from this age, every two years. This makes it possible to observe each part of the intestine and detect the presence or absence of a tumor.\nRead more\nNote that it is possible to reduce the risk of this type of cancer by favoring a healthy diet and physical activity, limiting alcohol consumption and giving up tobacco.\nVIDEO – Why do we lose our appetite when we are in love?\n1703800932\n#symptom #notice #holiday #season",

    "text": "Ukraine’s Western backers could trigger World War III by providing Kiev with weapons that can be used to strike targets on Russian soil, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has said. Russian officials have claimed that the Ukrainian military has been using Western-supplied weapons in their incursion in Kursk Region. Several Western media outlets have published articles with similar claims of late. A number of Kiev’s backers have also publicly given the green light to use the weapons they have provided on Russian soil. Speaking to Il Sussidiario media outlet on Wednesday, Salvini, who is also the minister of infrastructure and transport and leads the Lega Nord (Northern League) party, said the “sending of weapons to strike and kill also on Russian territory would be a disaster, the antechamber of a dramatic world conflict.” The deputy prime minister added that his right-wing party has nothing against providing “humanitarian and military aid to give Ukraine the possibility to defend itself.” Ahead of the European Parliament elections in June, Salvini urged Italians to not let left-wing parties win, as they, together with French President Emmanuel Macron, would make the prospect of a third world war dangerously real. “I strongly ask for a vote against the war, to isolate dangerous bombers like Macron,” he said at the time. Salvini also praised the Italian government for its firm position against those in Europe who speak about potentially deploying Western troops to Ukraine, having previously criticized the French president for refusing to rule this out. The deputy prime minister also stated in June that “we will no longer approve sending any type of weapon unless we have the certainty that those weapons will not be used to attack and kill inside Russia.” “It would be the incident that takes us straight towards the Third World War,” he said at the time. In late May, Defense Minister Guido Crosetto cited the Italian constitution, stressing that the weapons Italy supplies to Ukraine can only be used within the territory of the country. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani echoed this, telling reporters: “we are not fighting against Russia. We are defending Ukraine, [it] is not the same.” Around the same time, Salvini described NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as a “dangerous gentleman” after he proposed allowing Kiev to strike targets deep inside Russia with Western weapons. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, too, expressed incredulity as to “why Stoltenberg said such a thing.” It is my sincere desire to provide readers of this site with the best unbiased information available, and a forum where it can be discussed openly, as our Founders intended.

    "text": "2026 World Cup qualifying: Wales v Kazakhstan\nVenue: Cardiff City Stadium Date: Saturday, 22 March Kick-off: 19:45 GMT\nCoverage: Watch on BBC One Wales, iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app, plus S4C via iPlayer. Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sport Extra.\nEight games from winning promotion to the Premier League. Eight fixtures standing in-between Wales and the 2026 World Cup.\nLeeds United's Dan James knows he could about to have the year of his life.\nFortunately for club and country, he's having the season of his life.\nOnce widely criticised for lacking end product, he is now on track for a career-best tally of goals and assists in a single campaign.\n\"Outstanding,\" Daniel Farke has said of someone who has become integral to Championship leaders Leeds' bid to return to the top-flight, a player happy to carry the weighty Elland Road expectations of success.\nCraig Bellamy will be hoping for just as much attacking influence on the international stage as Wales plot their path to north America.\nAnd James is not shying away from it.\n\"I'm not a young player anymore,\" he says. \"I want to try and be that main man.\"\nBut, even for a player of electrifying pace, getting to that stage has taken some time.\nBellamy was made to be a manager - Hughes\nPublished 11 hours ago Who would you pick for Wales' World Cup qualifier?\nPublished 2 days ago 'That'll hurt forever' - World Cup pain drives Bellamy\nPublished 2 days ago 'Too good for the Championship' Maybe because he still appears somewhat fresh-faced, it's easy to forget how much 27-year-old James has already packed into his career.\nFrom his acceleration onto the scene as a teenager at Swansea City, there have been two major finals, 55 caps, and two £20m-plus moves since.\nBut there have also been crushing disappointments to deal with. From losing his father Kevan just weeks before completing a dream move to Manchester United in 2019, to the missed penalty that denied Wales shoot-out qualification for Euro 2024.\nThere was even the fact Leeds – who he joined for £25m in 2021 - had seemingly washed their hands of him, sending him out on loan to Fulham a year later.\nIt added to questions of whether the winger could cut it at the top level, something he was denied at answering when – back at Leeds – he was part of a side that lost last year's play-off final to Southampton.\n\"It would have been quite easy for him to have come back and think he was not wanted, that his days were numbered, and it was all against him,\" says Jon Newsome, a title-winner at Leeds.\n\"But he got his head down and become a better player. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better performer for Leeds. He's too good for the Championship.\"\nTen goals and nine assists – already just one goal contribution shy of last year's total - suggests he is right.\nFlourishing in the \"heavy\" Leeds shirt James' frightening speed has always made him a dangerous player.\nOr \"menacing\" as Bellamy once described him, having been without him for the first four games of his unbeaten start to life as Wales manager in the successful Nations League campaign.\nBut there is more to James' game now. A hardened mindset has seemingly brought a sharper edge – and, to use an adjective James repeatedly used about his improvements – a more \"ruthless\" player.\n\"As a winger I want to be as direct as possible, not turning things down,\" he says of what's changed, besides staying injury-free.\n\"Sometimes I look back at games and I've been quite safe. That might look good from the outside, keeping the ball, but ultimately I'm in the team to try and create things. That constant mindset of 'can I get a goal or an assist?' – and believing that.\n\"And when you do give the ball away, it's so important the reaction is to want it again.\n\"You might get tackled nine times out of ten but it's about that tenth time where something will happen, and I'm trying to keep that mindset.\"\nIt's been noticed. Leeds fans have found a new hero, James stepping into the space left when Crysencio Summerville moved to West Ham United last summer.\n\"There's definitely a difference this season,\" says Newsome, a co-commentator with BBC Radio Leeds.\n\"His final ball and end product is a lot better. He realises his assets - like that pace - and uses them to their best at every opportunity, but there's a maturity to his play.\n\"There's the responsibility of being an older player now, and suddenly the main man and coping with the expectation.\n\"The Leeds shirt can be heavy to wear at times, and it's too much for some. He's flourished.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, World Cup disappointment drives Wales forward James\nAn unlikely leader That comfort in being the go-to attacking hope has seen James' confidence levels rocket, as well as new leadership qualities shine.\nFarke says it's less about speeches but about work-rate, setting standards – music to the ears of Bellamy whose Wales team have similar pass, press and pace-filled principles.\n\"When you start the press off you can get the boys up for it on the pitch rather than off it,\" says James, who adds he's happy with the added responsibility at club and country.\n\"It doesn't add any pressure. There's games where things you try maybe don't go right, but you just continue to try and do the right stuff and keep trying to be that main man.\"\nIt's a trait James says he looked up to in Bellamy when the manager was himself an explosive attacker in the red of Wales.\nHaving only just shaken off a hamstring injury when he met up with the new-look Wales for the first time in November, James is eager to show he has soaked up the advice of an individual he takes inspiration from.\n\"He had that work-rate and he always wanted the ball, demanded the ball,\" he says.\n\"He wants the same from us, but the biggest thing I've tried to take into my game is to always get at your man.\n\"It's easy to get the ball, pass backwards when things aren't going right - and much tougher when it hasn't gone right to have the mindset of going again.\n\"Sometimes there's a risk of players or the crowd getting on you – but not here and the manager has your back.\"\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Dan James started his youth career at Hull City before joining Swansea City's academy\nA manager and a player of 'ruthless mentality' It all suggests Wales' adrenaline-fuelled style that saw them top their Nations League group is going to carry on into the World Cup campaign.\nAnd with James ready to embody the ethos when the World Cup campaign kicks off against Kazakhstan in Cardiff – and prepared be the main man, just as Bellamy once was.\n\"Exactly, that was him as a player; he had that ruthless mentality, he believed he was going to win the game for the team,\" he says, perhaps conscious that Wales will be missing another key and in-form attacker in the injured Harry Wilson.\n\"To have that person behind you, to put you in the situations to go and effect games and show your attributes, that's brilliant to know as a player.\"\nAnd a knowledge that could see James' impressive improvements continue in what could be a memorable year for club and country.\nRelated topics Wales Men's Football Team Championship Football FIFA World Cup Leeds United",

As she stated during her show's reunion back in March, Sophia loves being in LA.\nScottie Pippen's ex, Larsa Pippen, defends giving Sophia Pippen a $2,500 spending allowance Earlier this year, during the \"Real Housewives of Miami\" reunion, Larsa Pippen came under fire while discussing being a parent. According to Scottie Pippen's ex, the former couple's daughter gets a $2,500 monthly allowance for spending.\nSome of the other cast members and reunion host Andy Cohen seemed to be in disbelief at the amount. However, Larsa doubled down, saying that LA is expensive and Sophia makes her own money as well. During the reunion earlier this year, she responded to the shock over her daughter's monthly allowance, saying:\n\"You guys understand, like, LA is super expensive. So after school, she orders food or Uber or buys presents for her friends’ birthdays.\" With Sophia Pippen already boasting 227,000 Instagram followers, it looks like the NBA legend's daughter has already set herself up for more lucrative brand partnerships in the future as she gets older.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
