    "text": "Pope confidant: Francis is tired and resignation is possible\nVatican City - Pope Francis has been in hospital for just under a week. Now the word resignation has been mentioned several times to journalists. The head of the Church is tired, says a confidant of the Pope and potential successor.\nPublished on 20.02.2025 at 15:31 –The Pope's confidant and Archbishop of Marseille, Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, has commented on Francis' hospitalisation. The Pope is tired, Aveline told journalists at the Vatican on Thursday afternoon. He may not have more information than the media, but Francis is one of those people: \"If you really want him to rest, you have to hospitalise him, because otherwise he will never rest.\"\nAveline, who is also being rumoured as a possible successor to Francis, did not rule out the possibility of the head of the church resigning: \"Anything is possible!\" Everything is being followed with a certain amount of concern, but without trying to make predictions or chase after news. The best and shortest way from one person to another is prayer. \"That's my way of keeping up to date,\" says Aveline about how he is dealing with the current situation of the sick Pope. Francis has been receiving treatment for a complicated respiratory infection at the Gemelli Clinic in Rome since Friday.\nCuria cardinal: situation \"complex but not critical\"\nThe Italian Cardinal of the Curia, Gianfranco Ravasi, had previously told the Italian radio station RTL 102.5 that he believed the Pope would resign due to his personality. Despite his physical infirmity, he has so far refused to do so. But, Ravasi continued: \"If he were in a situation in which his ability to have direct contact with people was severely restricted, then I believe he could decide to resign.\"\nRavasi recalled that Pope Francis, according to his own statement, had already handed over a conditional letter of resignation to the Cardinal Secretary of State at the beginning of his pontificate. Regarding the Pope's current condition, Ravasi said on Thursday that according to the information provided by the Vatican, the situation is \"complex but not critical\". (KNA)",

    "text": "Kateryna Sievodnieva, 32, is now living and working in Cumbria\nThis is the second time Kateryna Sievodnieva will see in the new year thousands of miles away from her home in war-torn Ukraine. She is rebuilding her life and career in the UK, after fleeing the south-eastern city of Melitopol with her young daughter.\nMs Sievodnieva said she is grateful to the many people who have helped her and her daughter reach safety\nOn 24 February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine.\nMs Sievodnieva said, that morning, her life “changed forever”.\nShe and her husband woke up to the sounds of planes flying overhead and bombs exploding.\nRussian troops were roaming their city, the lights started going out and the mobile networks had gone down.\nAll the shops and supermarkets were being looted, she said.\nMs Sievodnieva was left trying to look after her five-year-old daughter in a war zone.\nThe south of Ukraine had always been an area abundant with crops of wheat, sunflowers and vegetables.\nMs Sievodnieva said “everything vanished”.\n‘We had nothing’ Amid days of shelling, her daughter had stomach pains so severe that the doctor initially thought it was appendicitis.\nThe ambulance would not have been able to reach them at night because of the curfew.\nIt turned out her daughter had been so scared of the explosions she had become severely constipated.\nMs Sievodnieva said she was frustrated trying to find medication and confronted a Russian soldier who told her they were there to liberate them.\n“I told them to tell that to my child who needs medicine which we can’t get because of them,” she said.\nMs Sievodnieva said her daughter’s life changed so many times but she is “getting better now”\nThe event that tipped them over the edge was shelling on their daughter’s birthday.\n“It was dreadful – when you can’t even buy a cake or gift for your child like a normal person,” she said.\nShe managed to rustle up a cake with ingredients she could find.\nThat night they decided to leave.\nIn April 2022 Ukrainian and Russian forces were locked in combat along a 300-mile (480km) frontline in eastern Ukraine\nThe family spent weeks travelling to the border, sleeping in their car or staying in the houses of villagers who welcomed them along the way.\nWhen they drove along the front line, Ms Sievodnieva said it looked like everything had been torn apart.\n“Hungry animals roamed and houses were in ruins,” she said.\nMs Sievodnieva and her daughter finally crossed the border into Poland in April, leaving her husband behind.\nSince Russia’s invasion, Ukraine has banned men of fighting age from leaving the country unless they have a valid exemption.\n“My daughter kept screaming and crying that we forgot daddy,” she said.\n“I needed to be strong.”\nIn Poland, Ms Sievodnieva and her daughter slept in a sports hall alongside more than 1,000 people where there was a “constant stench”, she said.\nThey decided to go to Germany.\nShe met a British journalist at the station who asked her why she wanted to go to the country.\n“In that moment, I had no answer,” she said.\nWhile in Germany, the British journalist helped Ms Sievodnieva find the UK government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme.\nLaunched in March 2022, almost 100,000 refugees took up the offer to stay with a sponsor in the UK for up to six months.\nWhen they arrived in Britain they had nothing.\n“I didn’t know where Carlisle or Cambridgeshire was located but it didn’t matter to me,” Ms Sievodnieva said.\nShe said their sponsors Steve and Ellie Blake became like a real family.\nBut still her daughter couldn’t sleep and often woke at night remembering the shelling in Ukraine.\nMs Sievodnieva said it was very difficult when they first arrived in Britain\nBecause she was in a new country, Ms Sievodnieva had to learn everything again.\n“I felt like a little child being taught how to navigate hospitals, how to pay bills,” she said.\n“Everything was new. It was very hard.”\n“But I understood that my daughter was by my side and she needed me to be strong.”\nKateryna now works with children with special needs at a school in Cumbria\nMs Sievodnieva, who had just been awarded a PhD in Ukraine when the war started, got a job in a school in Cumbria as a learning support assistant.\nShe said it was “very scary” to start work in a new place.\n“When you work with children they feel everything, you can’t deceive them,” she said.\nAs the fighting continues in Ukraine, Ms Sievodnieva said she was very grateful to her colleagues and to everyone who helped her and her family along the way.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Le Premier ministre Gabriel Attal, chef de file de la majorité sortante aux élections législatives, a accusé jeudi son rival d'extrême droite Jordan Bardella de présenter \"une centaine de candidats\" ayant tenu \"des propos racistes, antisémites et homophobes\", ce que le leader du RN a récusé en bloc.\n\"On ne peut pas construire l'apaisement et le rassemblement quand on présente dans cette élection plus d'une centaine de candidats, c'est à dire presque un sur cinq (...) pour lesquels on a trouvé des propos racistes, antisémites et homophobes\", a lancé Gabriel Attal lors d'un débat télévisé sur France2 avec Jordan Bardella et le socialiste Olivier Faure, qui représentait le Nouveau Front populaire .\n\"Caricature\" Citant nommément plusieurs candidats investis par le RN, M. Attal a aussi évoqué \"un jeune fils d'un cadre du Rassemblement national interpellé pour agression\", et fait référence à des articles de presse parus notamment dans Le Monde et Libération.\n\"Tout est faux, archi faux\", a répondu Jordan Bardella, affirmant qu'\"il y a eu des contre-articles pour démontrer que c'était faux et (que) Libération est poursuivi en diffamation\". Le Premier ministre a également dénoncé la volonté du RN de \"stigmatiser 3,5 millions de Français binationaux\" en leur interdisant l'accès à certains emplois jugés \"stratégiques\".\n\"Le message que vous (leur) envoyez, c'est 'Vous êtes plus corruptibles que d'autres, on n'a pas suffisamment confiance en vous pour vous confier des responsabilités'\", a asséné Gabriel Attal. \"Caricature\", a répliqué Jordan Bardella, estimant que son adversaire \"a intérêt à jouer sur les peurs\" et assurant qu'il ne souhaitait \"pas remettre en cause la double nationalité\".\ndossier : Dissolution de l’Assemblée, nouvelles législatives",

    "text": "> RAFAH, May 7 — Crowds danced, cheered, and fired in the air in the streets of the southern Gaza city of Rafah Monday after Hamas said it approved a ceasefire proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar.\nPeople were crying tears of happiness, chanting “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest”) and shooting in the air in celebration of the news, an AFP journalist reported.\n“I felt joy and kneeled before God in gratitude after the ceasefire announcement,” Nour al-Fara, 56, told AFP.\nShe said she was particularly relieved because her family was “in a state of anxiety since this morning, packing our belongings in preparation to leave”, after Israeli forces ordered inhabitants in parts of Rafah to evacuate ahead of a “limited operation”.\nAdvertisement People gathered in the hundreds, waving Palestinian flags, one even holding a party fog machine in the air for the festive occasion while others, perched on the shoulders of friends clapped their hands above the crowd.\nSome danced around a bonfire lit on the pavement, and others held up their hands in victory signs.\nMen stood on top of buses and trucks, waving handkerchiefs or waving their arms in the air as they celebrated.\nAdvertisement “We were very happy, we embraced each other, and cried”, Farah, 31, told AFP. Her joy was overshadowed by future living prospects in war-ravaged Gaza, and thinking about “how we will rebuild our lives after the destruction of our homes in Gaza.”\nMore cautious, Bakri Abdulhamid, 40, said that despite his initial joy, “we are also waiting for the occupation’s approval,” but is hopeful that Gazans will be able to “return to our homes tomorrow and end this ordeal.” — AFP",

    "text": "HCMC Unveils Strategic Plan to Become Asian Education Hub by 2030\nWilliam Lai Triumphs in Taiwan’s Election: Implications for Cross-Strait Relations\nIn a significant political development, William Lai has triumphed in Taiwan’s presidential election, signaling a powerful pro-sovereignty message to Beijing. The victory of Lai, also known as Lai Ching-te, is a clear indication of Taiwan’s intent to safeguard its independence from China and foster alignments with other global democracies.\nVictory Highlights and Reactions\nThis election saw Lai gain the majority vote in most districts, culminating in his departure from the New Tide faction of the Democratic Progressive Party out of reverence for the presidential office. In his victory speech, Lai called for unity within the party, emphasizing the need for consolidated efforts to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait. The international community was quick to respond, with Japan and the European Union being among the first to congratulate Lai on his victory.\nEngaging with Beijing and Strengthening Ties with Washington\nIn addition to safeguarding Taiwan’s independence, President-elect Lai plans to engage with Beijing and fortify unofficial ties with Washington. This strategic move aims to provide stability in the region amidst the potential tensions between Beijing and Taipei. His victory, however, has been met with mixed reactions from Beijing and the United States.\nImplications for Cross-Strait Relations and Regional Economy\nWilliam Lai’s election victory could potentially affect the dynamics of cross-strait relations and the regional economy. Analysts predict China’s response to the election as a crucial element to watch, given its reunification goal and the economic pressure it could exert on Taiwan. China’s military maneuvers and threats in the Taiwan Strait, coupled with the United States’ commitment to Taiwan’s security, are key factors that could influence the future course of Taiwan’s political landscape.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

    "text": "Representantes de comunidades afrodescendientes exigieron más participación y reconocimiento en las negociaciones que se desarrollan en la COP16 de Cali, Colombia, y en futuras cumbres ambientales por el rol que juegan en la protección y conservación de la biodiversidad.\nAsí lo defendieron en el Foro Internacional de Afrodescendientes, en el que la vicepresidenta y ministra de Igualdad de Colombia, Francia Márquez , apoyó las demandas de varias comunidades latinoamericanas.\nElizabeth Moreno Barco, lideresa afro y defensora de derechos humanos, habla en el Foro Internacional Afrodescendiente durante la COP16 en Cali (Colombia). EFE/ Ernesto Guzmán En este sentido, la lideresa afrocolombiana y defensora de derechos humanos Elizabeth Moreno Barco denunció que «la marginación social, racismo institucional y violencia de género», entre otros, que enfrentan las comunidades negras impiden que sus voces «sean escuchadas».\n«Enfrentamos grandes barreras que vulneran nuestros derechos», lamentó, para agregar que las mujeres afro son las que han estado y están «en primera línea de protección» de los recursos naturales, algo que tendría que ser reconocido.\nMoreno Barco fue galardonada con el Premio Nansen-Américas 2023 de Acnur por su trabajo con las personas desplazadas y víctimas del conflicto en Colombia.\nLa activista recordó que las comunidades afro de América Latina y el Caribe habitan más de 205 millones de hectáreas con importancia para la biodiversidad del planeta , por lo que deberían tener voz en el marco del Convenio de Diversidad Biológica (CDB) para poder explicar sus experiencias y «luchas para enfrentar desafíos en torno a la biodiversidad global».\nA lo largo de este jueves las comunidades afrodescendientes presentarán las conclusiones de la Cumbre África y su diáspora, celebrada la semana pasada en Cali, y socializarán una declaración que incluye recomendaciones y exigencias al CBD para asegurar que sus propuestas sean integradas en las decisiones de alto nivel que salgan de la COP16.\nAl respecto, el secretario ejecutivo adjunto de la Secretaría del CDB, David Cooper , resaltó la necesidad de «encontrar maneras» para que los pueblos puedan participar en la toma de decisiones que les permitan «continuar cuidando la biodiversidad», a la vez que defendió la urgencia de «proteger el conocimiento tradicional» afro.\n«Hecho icónico» Para la ministra de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible de Colombia y presidenta de la COP16, Susana Muhamad , este foro y su celebración en la Zona Azul , donde se llevan a cabo las negociaciones de alto nivel, es un «hecho icónico» porque implica que «no es un tema periférico».\nSusana Muhamad (i), ministra de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible de Colombia y presidenta de la COP16, habla junto a la vicepresidenta de Colombia, Francia Márquez, en el Foro Internacional Afrodescendiente durante la COP16 en Cali (Colombia). EFE/ Ernesto Guzmán «Gracias al compromiso del pueblo negro de América Latina y el Caribe, y al trabajo de liderazgos importantes, este tema ha logrado estar presente en la COP16 como un tema de negociación importante» y con una participación activa, resaltó Muhamad.\nAdemás, insistió en que cumplir las metas del Marco Global Kunming-Montreal no es «solamente cuestión de los Gobiernos», sino que tiene que ir aparejada con «una movilización y un respaldo de empoderamiento político de aquellas comunidades que están en la primera línea» de protección y conservación de la biodiversidad.\nLa COP16 de Biodiversidad, que se celebra en Cali hasta el próximo 1 de noviembre, tiene como emblema ‘ La COP de la gente ‘ y ha tenido una amplia participación de pueblos indígenas y afrodescendientes en varios espacios de la cumbre.
