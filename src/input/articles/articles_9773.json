    "title": "UEFA Nations League: Portugal edge past Croatia as Ronaldo scores his 900th goal | Football News - News9live",
    "text": "New Delhi: It was a game where two European heavyweights clashed, which saw Portugal taking on Croatia in the Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica. The match springed into life in the initial moments of the match as Diogo Dalot was found by Bruno Fernandes and the United duo succeeded in giving Portugal an early lead. The Manchester United full back, opened the scoring for Portugal in the opening seven minutes despite being an unexpected scorer. After sprinting into the penalty area, Dalot was discovered by his clubmate Fernandes, who then took his chance as the ball went through the legs of Livakovic to find the net making it 1-0 for Portugal. There were further chances for Roberto Martinez's side as they did threaten the Croatian defence but they failed to create any sort of real pressure that deserved to find the net. However, it was a moment when Cristiano Ronaldo achieved yet another major milestone, extending his record of most number of career goals by a player to 900. The Portuguese icon was found by Nuno Mendes who provided an inch perfect left footed cross into the Croatian box where Ronaldo timed his run to perfection and produced a neat first time finish to make it 2-0 for Portugal. Yet another day and yet another milestone achieved by the phenomenal Portuguese forward. Portugal kept on threatening and showed some real intent to go forward. However, despite the pressure from the hosts, it was the croatian side who reduced the deficit thanks to an unfortunate own goal from Diogo Dalot, who now scored on both the ends. Croatia managed to make it 2-1, breathing down the neck of the Portuguese side and at half time it remained that way in the second half. In the second half, both the sides came on to the pitch with a real intent in order to ge the best possible start to their campaigns. Both the sides managed to get their chances but Croatia just coudn't get the job done and as for Portugal, they failed to extend the lead. However, it was an enteraining game to watch where a historic moment took place involving the one and only Cristiano Ronaldo, who extended his career goals tally to 900. Truly an astonishing achievement for a player with high stature and pedigree. Player of the match: Nuno Mendes Nuno Mendes certainly had one of the best performances in a while as the full back did his defensive duties pretty well, while also contibuting in the attacking threat that Portugal imposed. He played a wonderful left footed cross from the left flank to find Cristiano Ronaldo who made no mistae in putting it away to score the second goal for Portugal. The left back was running tirelessly and he had a major impact on the pitch, thanks to his ability to move forward and make those overlapping runs. Despite the contention from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and also Vitinha, the PSG fullback certainly was amongst the best players on the pitch and put up a good shift for Roberto Martinez's side.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "An American citizen has been charged in Arizona with making threatening online comments that followed what police describe as a \"religiously motivated terrorist attack\" in Australia a year ago in which six people died.\nQueensland police officers Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold and innocent bystander Alan Dare were fatally shot by Gareth Train, his brother Nathaniel Train and Nathanial's wife, Stacey Train, in an ambush at the Trains' remote property in the rural community of Wieambilla on December 12, 2022.\nFour officers had arrived at the property to investigate reports of a missing person. They walked into a hail of gunfire, police said at the time. Two officers managed to escape and raise the alarm.\nPolice killed the three Trains, who have been described as conspiracy theorists, during a six-hour siege.\nThe FBI said agents arrested 58-year-old Donald Day Jr near Heber Overgaard, Arizona, last Friday.\nAuthorities said a federal grand jury indicted Day on two counts of interstate threats. The indictment said that from about the beginning of 2022 until February 2, 2023, Day \"engaged in a course of conduct demonstrating a desire to incite violence and threaten a variety of groups and individuals including law enforcement and government authorities\".\nDay, who lives in the northeastern Arizona town of Heber, was remanded to custody after he appeared in a Phoenix court on Tuesday and faces a potential five-year prison sentence if convicted, according to Arizona prosecutors.\nThe FBI is still investigating Day's alleged motive.\n\"The attack involved advanced planning and preparation against law enforcement,\" Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Cheryl Scanlon said, referring to the Trains.\n\"We know that the offenders executed a religiously motivated terrorist attack in Queensland. They were motivated by a Christian extremist ideology.\"\nAustralian police allege Gareth Train began following the suspect on YouTube in May 2020. A year later, they were communicating directly.\n\"The man repeatedly sent messages containing Christian end-of-days ideology to Gareth and then later to Stacey,\" Scanlon said.\nFBI legal attache for Australia Nitiana Mann said the FBI was committed to assisting the Queensland Police Service in its investigation.\n\"The FBI has a long memory and an even longer reach. From Queensland, Australia, to the remote corners of Arizona,\" Mann said.\n\"The FBI and QPS worked jointly and endlessly to bring this man to justice, and he will face the crimes he is alleged to have perpetrated.\"\n ",

    "text": "One analyst has explained that the outlook for Bitcoin should remain bullish as long as the cryptocurrency's price remains above this level. Bitcoin enjoys strong on-chain support above $41,800 in a new [Post](https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1743011866803151250) On X, analyst Ali talked about various BTC support and resistance levels from an on-chain perspective. In on-chain analysis, the strength of any support or resistance level depends on the amount of Bitcoin that investors have purchased at said level. The chart below shows what the distribution of different BTC price ranges based on holder costs currently looks like. What the different price ranges look like in terms of support and resistance near the current spot price. Source: [@ali_charts on X](https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1743011866803151250/photo/1) As shown in the graph above, the $41,800 to $43,100 range hosts the most Bitcoin acquisition value out of all the price ranges listed. To be more specific, approximately 2.4 million addresses within this range received 1 million BTC. Cost basis is naturally of utmost importance for any investor, as retesting the spot price can reverse their profit-loss position. In such a situation, when such a re-testing occurs, the possibility of holders taking some action increases. Holders who were in profit before retesting may buy more when retesting occurs, as they may believe that the same level that previously proved profitable will do so again. On the other hand, loss holders may want to sell at their break-even level as they may fear the cryptocurrency going down again, leaving them in the water again. These buying and selling moves are not enough to move the market when only a few investors are doing so, but if a large number of investors have their cost base in a narrow range, the reaction can be significant. As the range above $41,800 to $43,100 is dense among investors, this should be an essential on-chain range. The spot price is floating above the range so that these prices can act as a support barrier for the asset. Based on this, Ali explains, “As long as Bitcoin maintains its position above $41,800, the outlook remains bullish.” The chart shows that Bitcoin's price ranges above are not based on cost for so many investors. This could mean that there is not much resistance ahead for the coin. The analyst says that this lack of key resistance also strengthens the cryptocurrency’s ability to hold on to current levels or move towards higher levels. btc price Bitcoin is slowly making its way back after the recent crash, with its price climbing to the $43,800 mark.

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link) Après avoir perdu sur le court, Carlos Alcaraz était désemparé comme rarement, à la recherche d'une explication à cette lourde défaite dès le deuxième tour de l'US Open où il n'avait encore jamais cédé avant les quarts de finale. \"Je ne sais pas quoi dire\", commence par reconnaître l'Espagnol aux premières heures vendredi. Le Néerlandais, 74e mondial, est un joueur largement à la portée d'Alcaraz qui l'avait tranquillement battu lors de leurs deux précédentes rencontres, toutes sur dur. Alors le N.3 mondial s'est enfoncé dans une explication surprenante: lui qui atomise avec délectation ses adversaires ou les rend fous avec son jeu en toucher, dit avoir été déstabilisé par le manque de points \"donnés\" par van de Zandschulp. \"Je pensais qu'il allait me donner plus de points, de points gratuits... Il n'a pas commis autant de fautes que je pensais qu'il commettrait. Alors j'étais un peu déboussolé, je ne savais pas comment gérer ça\", affirme celui qui a battu deux fois d'affilée Novak Djokovic sur le Centre Court en finale de Wimbledon. Au coeur de l'été, Alcaraz, après avoir triomphé pour la première fois à Roland-Garros, avait aligné douze victoires, pour signer son deuxième titre à Wimbledon et atteindre la finale des Jeux olympiques de Paris. \"Je suis probablement arrivé à New York avec moins d'énergie que je pensais\", estime le puissant joueur de 21 ans en ajoutant ne pas vouloir y trouver une excuse. D'autant qu'en raison de blessures, il n'a joué que deux des cinq tournois de la saison sur terre battue au printemps (Madrid où il a perdu en quarts et Roland-Garros), n'a joué que deux matches (une victoire, une défaite) au Queen's en guise de préparation à Wimbledon, et un à Cincinnati (défaite), un peu maigre pour préparer l'US Open. Au total, il n'a ainsi accumulé depuis avril que 29 matches, dont 24 gagnés. L'an dernier sur la même période, il avait joué quatre des cinq tournois sur terre avec des titres à Barcelone et Madrid et une demie à Roland-Garros, puis avait remporté le Queen's et Wimbledon sur gazon, et avait enchaîné avec trois tournois sur dur en parvenant notamment en finale à Cincinnati et en demies à Flushing Meadows. Soit 45 matches joués pour un bilan de 40 victoires. \"Le programme est si dense. Je suis probablement un joueur qui a besoin de plus de repos avant les gros tournois. Il faut que j'y réfléchisse et que je tire les leçons\" de ce qui s'est passé à New York, insiste-t-il pourtant. Face à Van De Zandschulp, il évoque surtout son mental qui n'a pas été à la hauteur. \"Je ne suis pas bien mentalement, je ne suis pas fort, je ne sais pas me contrôler face aux difficultés, je ne sais pas les gérer\", affirme-t-il. L'Espagnol avait déjà donné un aperçu de cette faiblesse psychologique à Cincinnati où, dans un rarissime accès de colère sur un court, il avait fracassé avec acharnement sa raquette au sol avant de s'incliner face à Gaël Monfils. \"Je venais d'un été spectaculaire, à Roland-Garros, Wimbledon. Je pensais avoir fait un pas en avant en me rendant compte que pour gagner de grands titres il fallait être fort dans la tête. Et arrivé sur dur, je fais plusieurs pas en arrière\", déplore le joueur qui est devenu le plus jeune N.1 mondial en remportant l'US Open 2022. Il écarte cependant tout effet délétère sur son mental de sa défaite en finale des JO face à Djokovic. \"Ca a été difficile pendant 50 minutes, une heure, mais ensuite j'ai réalisé que gagner la médaille d'argent olympique était une grande réussite. J'étais vraiment fier. Alors je peux dire que cette défaite n'a eu aucun impact\", assure-t-il. Le flou demeure donc sur sa contreperformance majeure à New York. \"J'ai déjà vécu ce genre de match et à chaque fois je me suis dit qu'il fallait que j'en tire des leçons. Ce que je constate, c'est que je n'ai pas évolué et c'est le problème: je suis de nouveau là à dire que je n'ai pas su gérer, que je n'ai pas réussi à me pousser un peu (à mieux jouer)\", regrette-t-il. La grande question, pour celui qui est appelé à menacer les records du Big 3, est de savoir si cet état va durer. Djokovic, lui, perd un des principaux adversaires capable de le priver à New York d'un 25e titre en Grand Chelem.",

    "title": "Incredible tale of Eaglehawk policeman outsmarting his kidnappers",
    "text": "An Eaglehawk [police officer](https://www.police.vic.gov.au/) once turned the tables on two armed men who had taken him prisoner in a four-hour ordeal. Saturday, December 30 marks the moment in 1962 when First Constable Leigh Gallagher arrested his violent captors. Little-remarked on today, the case attracted national media attention in the early 60s, including in the pages of the Bendigo Advertiser. It remains one of the most extraordinary accounts of an arrest in Bendigo's history. Gallagher was 47 years old, with 15 years police experience, the night he spied from his police car two young men wearing white shirts and black pants, walking towards a bridge into Eaglehawk shortly after midnight, 61 years ago. What he did not know - no-one did, at that moment - was that the pair had just escaped from Bendigo's prison (now [Ulumbarra Theatre](https://www.bendigoregion.com.au/arts-culture-theatres/space/ulumbarra-theatre)). Graham Francis Grundy and John Neil Williams were among four prisoners who had vanished from their cells less than an hour earlier, under the cover of a heavy rainstorm. They were two 19-year-olds who were originally from Port Melbourne and Essendon. Gallagher stopped his car and asked what the pair were doing. \"The bigger man of the two [Williams] said he was going to see his grandmother in Eaglehawk,\" the policeman later told reporters, including those from the Bendigo Advertiser. Gallagher said he knew Williams' grandmother and that they should get in his car. The police officer had an ulterior motive. He was suspicious. As all three talked in the car, Gallagher accused the pair of lying. That was when all hell broke loose, according to Gallagher's later court testimony. Williams got riled up: \"Don't move or I'll put a knife between your ribs,\" the young man said. Gallagher retorted that \"if you talk like that you will find yourself with a bullet in yours\". The copper was bluffing. He did not have a gun. Williams flashed something that looked an awful lot like a knife and Gallagher reached for the police car's radio transmitter. In the scuffle, an escapee pinned the officer to his seat and chopped viciously at his throat. \"He cut my breath off and I went out to it. I don't know for how long,\" Gallagher later said. The abductors drove north. Williams leant over, every so often, to chop Gallagher's injured throat with his hand. It seems today, reading accounts of what happened next, like Grundy and Williams were at a loss for what to do with their newfound freedom. They certainly do not come across as the brains behind the prison escape. It is as if they tagged along with two other inmates (who would remain on the run for days until police tracked them down in New South Wales). Grundy and Williams decided to head to a farm near Robinvale because the latter had once worked there and left some clothing with a farmer called W J Harvey. Commonsense might have suggested Harvey would have been wild about two fugitives pulling up unannounced as his family slept, with a stolen police car and a hostage. Maybe Grundy and WIlliams did not have any commonsense. It was about 5am when they got to the farmhouse. Williams got out and walked towards the house, where he either woke Harvey up or ran into him already up and about. In the car, Gallagher told Grundy he had a bad cramp in his stomach. Grundy, for some reason, took this as an excuse to leave his hostage and walk towards Williams and Harvey. This is when Gallagher crawled out of the car, opened the bonnet and ripped out its distributor. \"The big fellow [Williams] came back and threatened to kill me for doing this and we had a bit of a struggle,\" he said in the account he later gave to the Advertiser. Gallagher rushed into the house, woke Harvey's wife and demanded she tell him if there were any weapons in the house. It turned out they had a .22 rifle. Gallagher went outside to find Williams and Grundy sitting in the police car. Evidently, they had decided there was no point running. Grundy surrendered without a struggle. \"The big man [Williams] ... said he would rush me. I told him I would certainly shoot if he did so,\" Gallagher told the Advertiser. Amid a protracted standoff, police officers arrived on scene. Harvey had called them. They had raced 11km to the farmhouse. That was the end of Williams' and Grundy's time on the run. In the days that followed, the Bendigo Advertiser published a front page picture of Gallagher and four of his colleagues having cups of tea, shortly after a medical check. He spoke slowly, due to his badly injured throat. The tea seemed to go down alright, though. Gallagher would soon be awarded a Police Valour Medal. His attackers were not so fortunate. A judge gave Williams a four-and-a-half year prison sentence with a minimum of three years. Grundy got three-and-a-half years with a minimum of two. The judge was more lenient than he could have been on account of the men's \"youth\". \"I am sorry for what I did to Constable Gallagher,\" Grundy told the court. \"I have not had much of a home life and my parents do not care about me.\" Williams did not offer any excuse for his behaviour but a lawyer said he had been an inmate of homes and institutions since the age of seven.

    "text": "20 de fev de 2025 às 14:03\nA Comissão das Conferências Episcopais da União Europeia (COMECE) declarou que as comunidades cristãs “são parte integrante e essencial da história e da cultura” da Síria e pediu à União Européia que reconhecer a vulnerabilidade das minorias religiosas no país, como os cristãos, e tomar medidas concretas para protegê-las.\nEm carta assinada pelo bispo de Latina-Terracina-Sezze-Priverno, dom Mariano Crociata, presidente da COMECE a entidade fala da preocupação com a crise humanitária na Síria, que já dura dez anos, desde o início da guerra civil que assola o país. Dom Crociata chama a atenção para o “imenso sofrimento do povo sírio” e diz ter esperança por um futuro marcado pela paz, pela dignidade e pela justiça.\nO bispo chama a atenção para a situação das comunidades cristãs, “parte integrante e essencial da história e da cultura da região há séculos”, que atualmente estão “lutando para manter sua continuidade histórica em sua terra natal”. Ele alerta que “perder” essas comunidades significaria uma “perda trágica não só para a Síria, mas para a estabilidade da região e do mundo”.\nEm nome da COMECE, dom Crociata também pede a elaboração de estratégias para dar apoio humanitário e recuperação econômica, por meio do “aliviamento gradual das sanções da UE e da criação de uma estrutura que permita a participação do setor privado com salvaguardas adequadas”.\nReceba as principais de ACI Digital por WhatsApp e Telegram\nEstá cada vez mais difícil ver notícias católicas nas redes sociais. Inscreva-se hoje mesmo em nossos canais gratuitos:\nO bispo também pede a promoção da “cidadania igualitária”, incluindo comunidades minoritárias no processo constitucional e nos esforços de reconstrução, e a promoção do diálogo, da “reconciliação e da cura”, evitando a vingança e implementando “um quadro legal para a justiça transicional”. Ele também pede a promoção do diálogo para “curar as divisões sociais”.\nAssim, a COMECE reafirma o compromisso da Igreja em apoiar os refugiados e deslocados sírios, destacando a necessidade de “trabalhar para criar condições que permitam o retorno seguro e voluntário dos refugiados e das suas famílias às suas casas”.\nA COMECE também destaca “o papel crucial dos atores religiosos no país, defendendo uma transição pacífica e promovendo a resiliência a longo prazo”.",
