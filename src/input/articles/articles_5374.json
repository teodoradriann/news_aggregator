    "title": "员工被迫\"放弃\"年休假，法院判决折算为工资|工资_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "“放弃”的年休假，离职后还能申请折现吗？这是一个困扰很多劳动者的问题。日前，上海浦东法院审理了一起案件，明确了公司作为用人单位不得限制员工的年休权。\n案情显示，刘某是某公司员工，2022年该公司未安排他休法定年休假，也未支付年休假折算工资。同年12月8日，刘某提交离职申请时，在系统里“其他”一栏中勾选“本人承诺所有年休假和调休已休完，若有未休完部分将视为自动放弃”，并于12月31日正式离职。之后，刘某申请仲裁，要求公司支付年休假折算工资，未获支持，遂诉至法院。\n公司认为，刘某作出年休假已休完的承诺，且“自动放弃”条款未违反法律规定，拒绝支付其年休假折算工资。刘某则提出，离职程序中“其他”一栏为必选项，不选不能进入下一个流程办理离职，且内容是系统预设的唯一选项，当初的“承诺”是被迫的。因此，自己有权主张年休假折算工资。\n浦东法院审理认为，该公司未安排刘某休年休假，离职申请系统的设置并无其他选项，实际上强制免除了公司作为用人单位的责任，限制了员工的年休权，故判决公司支付刘某年休假折算工资9875.13元。后公司不服上诉，二审法院维持原判。\n劳动法第四十五条规定，国家实行带薪年休假制度。劳动者连续工作一年以上的，享受带薪年休假。带薪年休假是法律赋予劳动者的权利，用人单位不得通过劳动合同或公司规章制度等排除劳动者休年休假或获得带薪年休假折算工资的权利。\n浦东法院民事审判庭法官陈浩表示，用人单位在行使用工管理权和审批权时，须遵循合法的首要前提，结合自愿、合理及协商一致的原则，不能以强制手段迫使员工放弃年休假，也不得滥用审批权，变相剥夺员工的年休假权利。对于用人单位基于自身优势地位，强迫员工承诺放弃年休假或通过不合理审批程序限制员工休假的，法院有权依法审查并予以纠正，以切实维护劳动者的合法权益。\n“劳动合同中免除用人单位的法定责任、排除劳动者权利的约定无效。”陈浩表示，用人单位不得通过格式条款或内部规定规避应承担的责任，也不能剥夺劳动者依法应享有的权利。\n本案中，用人单位未安排员工休年休假，却在系统的离职申请中设置格式条款，要求员工承诺“自动放弃”年休假，以此来规避应承担的法定义务。\n陈浩解释，这种设置本质上剥夺了劳动者依法应享有的年休假权利，因此不能据此认定劳动者在设定的情况下所作出的放弃年休假承诺系其真实意思表示。用人单位应对设置的格式条款合法性和合理性进行严格审查，防止利用自身优势地位变相侵害劳动者法定权利。\n（光明日报）",
