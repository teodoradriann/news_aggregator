    "text": "Bacolod City Councilor Jude Thaddeus Sayson assured the job order employees of their salaries. \"The budget is there and was already approved. It's just a matter of processing by the respective liaison officers of each office or department,\" Sayson, chair of Sangguniang Panlungsod committee on finance, said Thursday, December 28. He said his JOs will also get their salaries on Friday, December 29. \"The JOs can get their salaries as long as they have complete documents like their Daily Time Record,\" Sayson explained. He added that some JOs already got their salaries on Thursday, December 28. Meanwhile, Sayson said the regular employees, including the elected officials, will receive a total of P50,000 as extra bonus. In fact, the P30,000 Collective Negotiation Incentives have already been released, while the Service Recognition Incentive (SRI) amounting to P20,000 for each employee has also been released to some of the workers, while others will receive it first week of January, along with the P5,000 gratuity pay that the JOs will each receive. The budget for these was approved by the SP last week, Sayson said.*",

    "text": "The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates fireworks were responsible for at least 1,900 hundred injuries and 11 deaths nationwide last year. With the New Year’s holiday approaching, a Tampa Fire Rescue investigator is offering important safety tips to help residents celebrate the holiday safely and responsibly.\nFireworks accidents led to 10,000 emergency room visits in 2022 “Fireworks are a big deal and a big problem when it comes to an urban environment and shooting fireworks in that environment,” said Tampa Fire Rescue Lt. Frank Rosete. Rosete is the on-call fire investigator assigned to work New Year’s Eve. He said if the past is any indication, he’ll be busy. “I personally go on at least four to five calls related to fireworks,” he said when asked what a typical year looks like in Tampa. Rosete said most of the fires and injuries his department has responded to in the past are preventable.\nAccording to the Consumer Product Safety Commission , more than 10,000 people were treated in emergency rooms for fireworks injuries nationwide last year. Of those, 600 were burned by sparklers. “Adolescents 15 and under are the most injured from the sparklers because they run around. They play sword fights with each other,” Rosete said. “We could have lost him” Other injuries were caused by people re-lighting fireworks that didn’t ignite. “The time you decide to reignite it could be the time it decides to explode,” Rosete said. That happened to a man in Dade City in 2019. “We could have all lost him last night over a firework,” the accident victim’s girlfriend, Ashley Nicholls, said at the time. He was seriously injured after lighting a firework he found on the side of the road. “He lit it, and it blew up in his hand. He blew his thumb off. He broke his finger,” Nicholls said. Rosete said if you plan to launch your own fireworks, have a fire extinguisher or bucket of water close by. And he reminds people that drinking or drugging and explosives aren’t a good combination. “Kind of like a designated driver, have a designated shooter. That he or she is not gonna be under the impairment of an alcoholic beverage,” Rosete said. Leave it to professionals Rosete said it’s always better to leave something as dangerous as fireworks to those who really know what they’re doing. “There is opportunity to go see fireworks at a professional shoot versus you trying to do it at home and run the risk of injuring yourself or others or burning your property down,” he said. Here are some important fireworks safety tips for you to consider if you plan to shoot fireworks this New Year’s Eve.

    "text": "Uma denúncia publicada pela Revista Fórum aponta para um suposto esquema de “rachadinha” envolvendo o atual prefeito de São Paulo e candidato à reeleição, Ricardo Nunes (MDB). O esquema, segundo o denunciante, estaria em funcionamento na Secretaria Municipal de Infraestrutura Urbana e Obras (SIURB), cuja chefia de gabinete é ocupada por Eduardo Olivatto. Olivatto, que é ex-cunhado de Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho, conhecido como Marcola e líder do PCC, já foi alvo de investigações por veículos de imprensa.\nDe acordo com a denúncia, Ricardo Nunes teria praticado o crime de peculato, conhecido popularmente como “rachadinha”, antes mesmo de assumir a prefeitura. O autor da denúncia afirma que o prefeito oferecia cargos a indivíduos em troca da devolução de parte dos salários ou nomeava colaboradores que nunca exerciam funções, chamados de “fantasmas”.\nO denunciante revelou que houve alterações na estrutura de funcionários da SIURB para garantir o funcionamento contínuo do esquema. Além disso, para evitar que o caixa da secretaria ficasse com saldo positivo no fim do ano, haveria um aumento supostamente artificial nos contratos emergenciais, os quais seriam considerados “superfaturados”.\nO autor da denúncia declarou que apresentará as evidências à Polícia Federal nos próximos dias, incluindo um arcabouço probatório que acredita possuir.\nEm resposta às acusações, a assessoria de imprensa da Prefeitura de São Paulo qualificou as denúncias como “ilações anônimas” com “objetivos eleitorais espúrios”, especialmente em um momento tão próximo do segundo turno das eleições.\nA situação levanta questões sobre a integridade da gestão pública e as práticas de corrupção em tempos eleitorais, à medida que a cidade se prepara para o fechamento das urnas.\nLeia Mais:\nVocê pode fazer o Jornal GGN ser cada vez melhor.\nApoie e faça parte desta caminhada para que ele se torne um veículo cada vez mais respeitado e forte.",

    "title": "United We Stand:Rediscovering Unity Amidst Division",
    "text": "From Babel to Belfast, it seems that division is a fact of life. You will hunt in vain for anywhere in this world where it has been fully transcended. Even if there were such a paradise on earth, who can say for sure that old antipathies would not, if left unchecked for long enough, resurface or be replaced with new ones? Good relations are precious and must be worked at. Jesus knew this best of all. On the night of his betrayal in Gethsemane, the Lord prayed, ‘that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee’ ( [John 17.21, RSV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017%3A21&version=RSV)). Christ – on his knees in the cool grass, minutes away from the horrors of Roman ‘justice’ – pleads for us before his heavenly Father. Even as emissaries are on the way to bring him in, our Lord’s will is to see the world rediscover unity, the same world that would soon turn its back on him. This is no begrudging unity, mandated by political correctness, but one which embodies the love that God the Father has for the Son, with whom he is ‘of one substance’, and that God the Son has for the Father. In order to ‘be one’ with our neighbor, we must see them as ‘of one substance’ with us. You, reader, and I share a common humanity, just as God the Father and God the Son share a common divinity. This ‘one substance’ language, in case it sounds familiar, [comes from the Nicene Creed](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nicene-Creed), where all the main tenets of our faith are catalogued. Recently, the divisions where I live, Northern Ireland, have sailed back into view more starkly than a winged elephant. I had optimistically thought, after all these division-plagued years, that we had finally bought our ticket on the streetcar named [Shared Future](https://www.niacro.co.uk/sites/default/files/publications/A%20Shared%20Future-%20OFMDFM-Mar%202005.pdf). Soon, thought I, the pointless divisions between British Unionists and Irish Nationalists will have disappeared. Such was too bold an assumption. Whenever a new housing development appears, for example, one of two flags will almost immediately be flown from the lampposts (the Union Jack or the Irish Tricolour) to signal a British or an Irish identity. Neutrality goes down the pan. It’s polling season and all ( [a UK general election is imminent, as I write](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/general/general-election-2024-timetable/)) but it’s inescapably true that many politicians frame the vote in sectarian terms because it works for them, electorally. They have done so for decades: vote Unionist and keep the Nationalists out; vote Nationalist and keep the Unionists out. Rinse and half-heartedly repeat every four years. We call this playing the orange card (‘vote Unionist’) or playing the green card (‘vote Nationalist’). Instead, we could spend our time on the practical issues which affect us all. Game of Thrones, [a show that has deep links with Northern Ireland](https://discovernorthernireland.com/things-to-do/tv-and-film/game-of-thrones), is premised on the need for old enemies – the Greyjoys, the Lannisters, the Starks, and the Targaryens – to leave aside unimportant squabbles and oppose an enemy who threatens them all: the Night King and the White Walkers. [There is no lack of issues](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues), God knows, around which we could unite in the real world. I had also presumed, until recent weeks, that ‘Unionist’ and ‘Nationalist’ were ideological positions on the constitution: United Kingdom or United Ireland. Both of these words, as used in our discourse, have come to sound more like ethnic identities than political stances to me. Ponder these quotes, [all used in a single Northern Ireland Assembly debate](https://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/officialreport/report.aspx?&eveDate=2022/05/30&docID=374260): (1) ‘the unionist community’; (2) ‘the unionist people’; (3) ‘the unionist electorate’. If unionism – or, for that matter, nationalism – were a belief system rather than a tribal moniker, then it would be possible to substitute, in the phrases above, the names of other ideological persuasions. Let’s give it a go, then: (1) ‘the conservative community’? Nope; (2) ‘the liberal people’? Nope; (3) ‘the socialist electorate’? Nope. Nobody that I know talks like this (except about unionism or nationalism). This is proof enough that neither are simply political doctrines in the usual sense. Consider, on the contrary, [the Samaritan from Christ’s parable](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A25-37&version=RSV), whose compassion transcends ethnic barriers. Jews and Samaritans lived separate lives but when the cry for help rang out, none of this mattered; the need was the same. Ideologies – whether Judaism or Samaritanism, Unionism or Nationalism – aren’t people. They have no friends or family, no hopes or dreams, no thoughts or feelings. Why, then, do we so frequently put ideologies before human beings? Given the biblical sources I’ve mentioned, why does God allow division, whether along ideological or other lines? Eight-year-old me looked after his Tamagotchi better, it sometimes feels, than God looks after this world. If it seems that way, however, then it means we believers have a job on our hands: to make this a world where, in St Paul’s words, we are ‘all one in Christ Jesus’ ( [Galatians 3.28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A25-37&version=RSV)). ‘Christ has no body now but yours,’ [the hymn says](https://www.journeywithjesus.net/poemsandprayers/3637-Teresa_Of_Avila_Christ_Has_No_Body), ‘Yours are the hands, with which he blesses all the world.’ Indeed, as I wrap this article up, I leave you with one more item from the grain tower of random quotes that float around my head like breadcrumbs in a duckpond: ‘Where there is discord, may I bring harmony’ (Francis of Assisi). 7/12/2024 12:23:11 AM",

    "text": "ROMA, 12 OTT - Dopo la pioggia dei giorni scorsi torna il sole e promette un fine settimana di bel tempo, soprattutto al Centro-Sud. E' l'inzio di una fase di alta pressione che dovrebbe inaugurare la prossima settimana. Lo indicano le previsioni del meteorologo Mattia Gussoni, del sito iLMeteo.it. \"Nelle prossime ore avremo prevalenza di sole\", si legge nella nota, mentre a Nord \"il cielo sarà più nuvoloso su Piemonte poi su Liguria, Valle d'Aosta e Lombardia occidentale; dal pomeriggio qualche addensamento non è escluso anche su Appennini, Alpi orientali ed Alta Toscana. Altrove il sole sarà dominante e le temperature massime saranno gradevoli: al Nord tra i 18°C e i 23°C, al Centro tra i 21°C e i 25°C, al Sud tra i 23°C e i 28°C\". Cielo sereno e sole sulla maggior parte delle regioni sono previsti anche per domenica 13 ottobre, \"salvo nubi medio-basse su Piemonte meridionale e Friuli Venezia Giulia, specie al mattino. Durante tutto il weekend non sono attese precipitazioni se non qualche piovasco sabato su Valle d'Aosta, Alto Piemonte, Alta Lombardia e Liguria\". Una situazione simile si annuncia anche per la prossima settimana, prosegue il meteorologo, con tempo \"piuttosto stabile e soleggiato quasi ovunque\". E' comuque atteso pe rlunedì \"un aumento della nuvolosità sul settentrione con la possibilità di isolata pioviggine, più probabile al Nord-Ovest\". In generale si profila sull'Italia un periodo di alta pressione, \"circondato a destra e sinistra da due zone cicloniche, una sulla Spagna ed una sulla Turchia\". Nel dettaglio: sabato 12: al Nord nuvoloso; al Centro soleggiato; al Sud soleggiato. domenica 13: al Nord nubi irregolari; al Centro via via più nuvoloso; al Sud bel tempo. lunedì 14: al Nord piovaschi a ovest; al Centro poco nuvoloso; al Sud bel tempo..",

    "title": "Guerre Israël-Hamas : ce qu'il faut retenir de la journée du jeudi 28 décembre",
    "text": "Israël poursuit son offensive contre le Hamas palestinien avec des bombardements à Khan Younès, dans le sud de la bande de Gaza, ainsi que des incursions en Cisjordanie et des frappes près de la capitale syrienne, jeudi 28 décembre. L'armée a également rendu ses conclusions après la mort de trois otages israéliens tués \"par erreur\" le 15 décembre. Voici les principaux événements du 83e jour de combats entre Israël et le Hamas.\nL'armée israélienne poursuit ses frappes sur Khan Younès L'armée israélienne a poursuivi jeudi ses opérations à Khan Younès, principale ville du sud de la bande de Gaza, mais aussi dans les camps de réfugiés du centre du territoire où des frappes nocturnes mortelles ont été signalées par le ministère de la Santé du Hamas.\nLe ministère de la Santé du Hamas a fait état de 21 320 morts, et 55 603 blessés depuis le début des bombardements israéliens. L'armée israélienne a indiqué que plus de 500 soldats israéliens, officiers et réservistes, ont été tués depuis le 7 octobre, dont 167 dans l'offensive terrestre lancée le 27 octobre\n40 % de la population de Gaza menacée de famine, selon l'UNRWA Dans une publication sur X (ex-Twitter), l'UNRWA estime que \"40 % de la population est désormais menacée de famine\" . \"Chaque jour est une lutte pour survivre, trouver de la nourriture et trouver de l'eau\" , a déclaré Thomas White, le patron de l'agence de l'ONU pour les réfugiés palestiniens. Selon l'UNRWA, \"le seul espoir restant est un cessez-le-feu humanitaire\" .\nL'ONU demande de mettre fin aux \"homicides illégaux\" en Cisjordanie Un Palestinien a été tué et 14 autres ont été blessés jeudi à l'aube, lors d'une incursion de l'armée israélienne à Ramallah, en Cisjordanie occupée, selon l'agence officielle palestinienne Wafa. Dans ce contexte, l'ONU a demandé à Israël de \"mettre fin aux homicides illégaux\" au sein de la population de ce territoire, dénonçant une détérioration rapide des droits humains dans cette zone.\nUne otage israélo-américaine déclarée morte par son kibboutz Judith Weinstein Haggai, âgée de 70 ans, est décédée le jour de son enlèvement par le Hamas palestinien lors de l'attaque du 7 octobre , a annoncé jeudi le kibboutz de Nir Oz, où elle résidait. Elle était présentée comme la femme la plus âgée retenue en otage dans la bande de Gaza.\n\"Il a maintenant été autorisé de publier qu'elle a été tuée ce samedi-là\" , a déclaré le kibboutz, six jours après l'annonce du décès de son mari dans des circonstances similaires. Sur les 250 personnes prises en otage par le mouvement islamiste lors des attaques, qui ont fait environ 1 140 morts, 129 sont toujours retenues à Gaza, d'après les autorités israéliennes.\nOtages tués par l'armée israélienne : des soldats avaient entendu des appels au secours, selon l'armée Des soldats israéliens avaient entendu des appels au secours des trois otages retenus par le Hamas à Gaza abattus \"par erreur\" le 15 décembre, selon les conclusions d'une enquête de l'armée publiées jeudi. Lors de leur assaut sur un bâtiment le 10 décembre, des soldats ont entendu des cris de \"otages\" et \"au secours !\" en hébreu, raconte l'armée. Mais ils ont cru à un stratagème de combattants du Hamas pour leur tendre un piège dans cet immeuble situé à Choujaiya, et sont sortis du bâtiment.\nLes otages sont sortis le 15 décembre torse nu et brandissant un drapeau blanc, mais des soldats israéliens les ont \"identifiés comme des menaces\" et ont tiré, tuant deux d'entre eux sur le coup. D'après les conclusions de l'armée, le commandant du bataillon sur place a donné l'ordre à ses troupes de ne pas tirer, et à l'otage survivant d'avancer vers les soldats. Mais deux d'entre eux, \"qui n'ont pas entendu l'ordre à cause du bruit d'un char à proximité\" , ont abattu l'otage.\nLa France accueille deux premiers enfants palestiniens blessés Les deux enfants ont été \"pris en charge dans des services hospitaliers pédiatriques\" , ont annoncé les ministères de la Santé et des Affaires étrangères dans un communiqué conjoint, qui \"remercie les autorités égyptiennes\" pour leur participation à ces évacuations. Les deux ministères \"travaillent à une nouvelle opération\" du même genre \"dès la semaine prochaine\" pour des enfants palestiniens \"blessés ou gravement malades \".\nDes frappes israéliennes près de la capitale syrienne Israël a \"procédé à des frappes aériennes depuis le Golan syrien occupé, visant des cibles dans la région sud\" , a indiqué le ministère de la Défense syrien. \"Notre défense aérienne intercepte des cibles hostiles dans les environs de Damas\" , avait écrit plus tôt l'agence officielle syrienne Sana.\nSelon l'Observatoire syrien des droits de l'Homme les frappes ont visé une position de la défense aérienne syrienne dans la région de Sweida, au sud, et les environs de l'aéroport international de Damas. L'attaque près de l'aéroport est intervenue 24 heures après la reprise des vols, suspendus depuis une attaque israélienne fin novembre.\nUn accord de principe pour un corridor humanitaire via Chypre Israël a donné son accord de principe à Chypre pour l'ouverture d'un corridor maritime entre l'île de Méditerranée orientale et la bande de Gaza, sous la supervision d'Israël, afin d'acheminer directement de l'aide humanitaire dans le territoire palestinien. \"Il y a encore quelques problèmes logistiques qui doivent être résolus\" , a précisé le porte-parole du ministère israélien des Affaires étrangères.",

    "text": "BENGHAZI (Reuters) – Three key Libyan leaders said on Sunday they had agreed on the “necessity” of forming a new unified government that would supervise long-delayed elections.\nA political process to resolve more than a decade of conflict in Libya has been stalled since an election scheduled for December 2021 collapsed amid disputes over the eligibility of the main candidates.\nThe leaders are the president of the Presidential Council (PC) Mohamed Menfi, the head of High State Council (HSC) Mohamed Takala, who are both based in Tripoli, and Aguila Saleh, speaker of the House of Representatives (HoR) in Benghazi.\nIn a joint statement, the three leaders also called on the U.N. Mission in Libya and the international community to support their proposals.\nThey said they had agreed to form a technical committee to “look into controversial points”.\nThey met in Cairo at the invitation of Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit.\n“The measures that were agreed upon today, we believe, are a very important beginning. They are results that live up to the ambition of Libyans to hold elections,” Menfi told the media after the meeting.\nMenfi came to power when the Government of National Unity (GNU) under Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah was installed through a U.N.-backed process in 2021, but the parliament no longer recognises its legitimacy.\nDbeibah has vowed not to cede power to a new government without national elections.\nThe House of Representatives was elected in 2014, while the High State Council was formed as part of a 2015 political agreement and drawn from a parliament elected in 2012.\nLast week, Central Bank governor Sadiq Kabir wrote to parliament asking it to approve a new unified government and a national budget over GNU extent spending.\nInternational diplomacy to resolve the conflict in Libya has focused on pushing for parliamentary and presidential elections to replace the interim political institutions, including the HoR, HSC and GNU.\nWhile all major political players in the country have called for elections, many Libyans doubt they genuinely seek a vote that could remove most of them from power.\nLibya has had little peace since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising, and it split in 2014 between eastern and western factions, with rival administrations governing in each area.\n(Reporting by Ayman Werfalli; editing by Giles Elgood)",
