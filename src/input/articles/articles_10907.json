    "title": "Why Biden’s order on the ‘out of control’ border may not fix Democrats’ political problem",
    "text": "President Biden has been trying to frame the November election around two subjects: his legislative accomplishments and former President Trump’s fitness to serve.\nBut Biden’s own vulnerabilities have been getting in the way. High among them for many voters is a sense that the country is in chaos, fueled in part by images of an overwhelmed southern border that have flooded television screens and social media feeds since he took office.\n“The fentanyl that is coming across the border is coming into our communities,” said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, where Biden is down by an average of 6 percentage points to Trump, in an interview. “The human trafficking that happens at the border comes into our communities.”\nThat helps explain why Biden took executive action this week — severely limiting the rights of migrants to seek asylum — that surprised and angered many allies on the left and could very well be struck down in court.\n“He did what he had to do, not just because it is a huge campaign issue, but because it’s a genuine problem,” said David Axelrod, who served as a top political advisor to former President Obama. “He probably should have done it sooner.”\nBiden, Axelrod, Cortez Masto and other Democrats have been laying the border problem at the feet of Republicans, who tanked a bipartisan bill earlier this year that would have given the president more money and leverage for border enforcement, because former President Trump wanted to keep the issue alive for the campaign.\nBut despite his role in killing the enforcement bill, Trump maintains a big lead on the question of which candidate can better handle the problem, including an ABC poll released last month that showed he leads Biden 47% to 30% on whom to trust more on fixing the border.",

    "text": "Brits could face two of the chilliest months with snow as we head towards the New Year. According to the Met Office, the chance of\nwintry showers remains 'increasingly likely'.\nSnow is more likely in January and February - with the Beast from the East hitting hardest in February 2018. There are now signs a colder change is coming.\nNick Silkstone, Met Office deputy chief forecaster, said: \"Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder than average conditions becoming increasingly likely.\" Settled conditions are expected to bring on an onset of colder air from the east.\nREAD MORE:\nMan caught with drug-dealing phone between his legs locked up\nGet breaking news on\nBirminghamLive WhatsApp. Join our dedicated community to get the latest updates.\nThis in turn could spark temperatures to fall to sub-zero levels, bringing icy conditions and snow,\nExpress reports. Scotland and northern England are typically the regions where snow is likely to settle.\nBut according to one meteorologist, the south could still see some snow. Jim Dale, a senior\nmeteorologist for British Weather Services, said: \"Expectation is indeed for colder weather, but it is likely well before mid-month. However, there are plenty of conflicting pointers, so confidence cannot be too high at this point.\n\"Nevertheless, I do expect\nsn ow and ice events to gradually cascade southwards at the end of the first week of January.\" He added: \"There will be no beast as such, more a northern Troll from Trondheim.\n\"I expect Scotland to be fairly loaded, some chaos for parts of the north and, at the moment, a dusting of less for the south. The caveat is, we haven't yet seen the whites of the Troll’s eyes yet.\"\nWeather maps show a vertical band of rain, stretching from Scotland to Kent, falling as snow for much of the north of the UK on Sunday, January 7. Rural, higher ground will get a coating.\nTemperatures will remain marginally normal for the time of year. But conditions are predicted to worsen from January 11, with the south of the country heading towards freezing temperatures.\nScotland will alternate between -1C, 0C and 1C, depending on the area. Maps also show an icy deluge pushing southwards over the country, with some isolated areas getting bouts of freezing rain among snow showers.\nIn its long range forecast for January 2 to 11, the\nMet Office said: \"During this time there is a good chance that many central areas may remain relatively fine for a number of days. Thereafter, more settled and calmer conditions are expected to gradually develop quite widely, increasing the risk of frost and fog.\n\"This would also lead to day on day net cooling eventually bringing below average temperatures for many, with an increased threat of winter hazards, including ice/snow if any precipitation runs into the cold air in place over land.\" Looking at January 12 to 26, it added: \"Compared to normal, there is an increased chance of colder than average conditions during this period, and a reduced chance of prolonged periods of very unsettled/milder conditions with frequent rain and wind pushing in from the Atlantic.\n\"Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.\"",

    "title": "Nice: Christophe Galtier définitivement tiré d'affaire après son procès pour harcèlement et discrimination",
    "text": "Encore une bonne nouvelle pour Christophe Galtier. Il y a une semaine, l’entraîneur de 57 ans poursuivi pour discrimination et harcèlement était relaxé à l’issue de son procès à Nice. Ce vendredi, le parquet annonce à Nice-Matin qu’il ne fera pas appel de cette décision prise par le tribunal correctionnel de Nice.\nAprès avoir requis un an de prison avec sursis et 45.000 euros d’amende, le procureur de la République, Damien Martinelli, avait jusqu’à dimanche pour interjeter appel. Avec cette décision, le coach d’Al-Duhail est donc totalement blanchi dans cette affaire. “Aucune des deux infractions n’est caractérisée”, avait indiqué le tribunal correctionnel de Nice, en prononçant son jugement.\nChristophe Galtier à son procès à Nice\n“Ce dossier était vide” selon l’avocat de Galtier L’affaire avait commencé au mois d’avril avec la révélation de l’After Foot, sur RMC, et du journaliste Romain Molina, d’un email daté de mai 2022 de Julien Fournier, alors directeur général de l’OGC Nice, à l’actionnaire, le groupe britannique Ineos. Il y accusait Christophe Galtier de réclamer moins “de noirs et de musulmans” dans l’équipe et de s’insurger contre les joueurs qui refusaient de suspendre le jeûne du ramadan les jours de match, comme le faisaient les Lillois musulmans avec lesquels il avait été champion de France la saison précédente.\nAu cours de l’enquête, de nombreux autres responsables du Gym et d’Ineos avaient assuré n’avoir jamais entendu parler de souci avec Galtier dans le vestiaire, avant la révélation de ce mail. Plusieurs avaient plutôt insisté sur les relations exécrables instaurées au fil de la saison entre Fournier et l’ex-coach du PSG.\nA l’audience, mi-décembre, aucun des accusateurs du coach des Aiglons pendant la saison 2021-2022 ne s’était présenté à la barre, où Galtier était resté debout pendant huit heures, écoutant sans broncher la lecture fastidieuse des éléments saillants des procès-verbaux d’une trentaine d’auditions réalisées dans ce dossier. L’enquête avait démontré qu’aucun des joueurs de Nice suivant le ramadan n’avait concrètement été écarté des terrains. “Ce dossier était vide”, avait affirmé l’avocat de Christophe Galtier Me Schapira après sa relaxe.",

    "title": "Damning report hits out at UK weight-loss clinic that secretly filmed clients",
    "text": "A cosmetic and weight loss clinic that secretly filmed patients is “not safe”, the health watchdog has found.A damning report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found that Doncaster-based Elements Medical was inadequate in every area it inspected in October, concluding it was “not safe”, “not effective” and “not well led”.The clinic, which also operates online as The Virtual Slimming Clinic, offers services including weight management, pre and postoperative care for cosmetic and bariatric surgery , treatments for skin conditions including acne, and vitamin injections, the CQC said on Friday.Among the long list of concerns, the report said: “We saw that people were covertly filmed at the premises including while receiving treatment, without their knowledge or consent.“In addition, the provider told us that the closed-circuit television monitoring (CCTV) was monitored and managed by a third-party provider which posed a safeguarding risk.”The inspectors said they found a large quantity of the muscular injection Dysport in a fridge which was turned off during clinic times because it was noisy.The report said: “Staff told us this medicine had been imported from Turkey, and we found labels on the medicine were not in English, however, the provider did not have a licence to import any medicines to England.“Turkey is also not an approved country for the purposes of supplying medicines for use in England by the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).”The report continued: “We also found the provider was using this injection in place of Botox, however, people using the service had not been informed of this.“We saw evidence that vials which were meant for single use only were being shared between multiple patients, which posed a significant infection risk.”The inspectors also said that the firm bought the dilutant Bacteriostatic sodium chloride 0.9% from a website which said: “All products listed on this website are for research purposes only, we do not advocate or advise human use, and any such use is entirely at your own risk.”They pointed to a series of other safety concerns, including obstructed fire exits, “lit candles in clinic and waiting rooms which were unattended for significant periods of time”, unsafely stored oxygen, and a defibrillator with no pads which left it “not usable in the event of an emergency”.The report concluded that the provider showed “a disregard for the safety of staff and people using the service and staff, confidentiality, and information security”.It said: “The CQC assessment team did not feel that all staff, including the provider, acted with openness, honesty and transparency during the inspection visit.“There was a disregard for the duty of candour. Where people had been placed at significant risk of harm by the service, we saw no evidence that they had been informed of this.”The CQC said it did not inspect how caring or responsive the service was, as it focused on the areas of concern, and these areas both remain rated as good from the previous inspection.Being placed in special measures means the service will be kept under close review by CQC, the watchdog said.Alan Stephenson, CQC deputy director of operations in the north, said: “When we inspected Elements Medical, we had serious concerns about the safety of the service and how it was being managed, to ensure people were getting the service and treatment they deserve.“We identified widespread shortfalls including people’s understanding of procedures and their consent to them, and how the service kept people safe from abuse.“Staff lacked basic knowledge of safeguarding procedures, including how to report concerns, and the service secretly filmed people during treatment without consent.”Mr Stephenson said: “We have told Elements Medical where we expect to see rapid and widespread improvements and will continue to monitor them closely to keep people safe while this happens.“We will return to check on their progress and won’t hesitate to take further action if people are not receiving the care they have a right to expect.”The report will be published on CQC’s website in the next few days.",

    "text": "California's first huge swells of the winter are wreaking havoc on the state's coastline as an incoming atmospheric river storm is forcing evacuations amid flooding of beach and coastal roads. Marin County residents in the Calles Pinos, Pradero, Sierra, Onda Resaca, Ribera and Embarcadero areas as well as Calle de Arroyo were [ordered to temporarily evacuate](https://emergency.marincounty.org/) Thursday morning due to high risk of wave damage and coastal flooding. Evacuated residents were told to head to the Stinson Beach Community Center. Santa Cruz County issued an [evacuation warning Thursday on X,](https://x.com/sccounty/status/1740409668441424041?s=20) formerly known as Twitter, for coastal areas near Seacliff State Beach because of flooding. Within the evacuation area, the tourist hot spot known as the Rio del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded with several inches of storm water. [On X, the California Highway Patrol](https://x.com/CHPscrz/status/1740409154890788893?s=20) cautions that residents avoid the area and not attempt to drive across or through. According to the [National Weather Service's coastal flood warning](https://www.weather.gov/mtr/) for the Bay Area, large breaking waves are causing significant flooding of beach and coastal roads. The waves are depositing large amounts of debris and causing road closures. The San Francisco Bay Area coast could see waves up to 40 feet in some locations. The National Weather Service issued a warning for residents to stay away from rocks, jetties, piers and other waterside infrastructure. In Southern California, the waves aren't expected to be as big, but high surf is expected through Saturday, meteorologists said. In Ventura County, waves of up to 12 feet have already been reported, and the Central Coast has seen 18- to 20-foot swells, said Mike Wofford with the National Weather Service's Oxnard office. In a beachside community in Ventura, [residents watched](https://twitter.com/PostScottWilson/status/1740454171122569265) as waves washed trash bins away, sending foaming streams of seawater into neighborhood streets. A high surf advisory went into effect at 4 a.m. Thursday for Point Conception in Santa Barbara County and Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach and Palos Verdes Peninsula beaches in Los Angeles County, all of which can expect sets of 15- to 20-foot waves and dangerous rip currents. \"We're expecting the highest waves today to be arriving either late morning or early afternoon and then, maybe some drops in height tomorrow, but still well above normal,\" Wofford said. The waves will pick back up Saturday when another surge of higher swells arrives. There have been [really strong storms](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-10-19/noaa-predicts-warm-wet-el-nino-winter-for-california-after-summer-of-record-heat) over the Pacific Ocean that \"we don't necessarily see because they move up to the north or go in some other direction,\" Wofford said. While the storms are moving through, strong winds can form big waves, which \"propagate out along, and the waves just come barreling right in,\" he said. Along with the high surf advisory, the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory through 10 p.m. Saturday. Although no structural or road damage is expected, there is an increased risk for drowning, the agency warned. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea, and large breaking waves can cause injuries, wash people off beaches or rocks and capsize small boats. \"Never turn your back to the ocean,\" the [National Weather Service said on X](https://x.com/NWSBayArea/status/1740326735466418358?s=20). Rain won't be compounding the waves in the Los Angeles County area, as the forecast doesn't call for rain until early Saturday and will continue for most of the day until it tapers off, Wofford said. There's a 30% to 40% chance of rain Sunday into Monday, but it will be in the form of light showers. ©2023 Los Angeles Times. Visit at [latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com).

    "text": "Rayssa Leal retorna ao STU Pro Tour e afirma: 'Há muita responsabilidade'\nSkatista brasileira retorna ao campeonato após um ano ausente\nO STU Pro Tour, um dos principais eventos do skate mundial, inicia suas atividades em Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, neste fim de semana, de 21 a 23 de março. O evento marca o retorno de Rayssa Leal ao tour, após um ano de ausência devido à sua preparação e participação nas Olimpíadas de Paris, onde conquistou sua segunda medalha olímpica.\n➡️ Rayssa Leal e Valentina Herszage brilham na Semana de Moda de Paris\nRayssa Leal, agora com 17 anos, reflete sobre as mudanças que ocorreram desde sua última participação no STU Pro Tour.\n— O que em mim nesse tempo que não venho aqui? Muita coisa. Não só eu como profissional, mas como pessoa. Evoluí muito como pessoa, como atleta, como irmã, como filha. Minhas manobras mudaram, minha força, meu corpo. Então, a gente vai passando por toda essa transformação — compartilha a skatista.\n➡️ Siga o Lance! no WhatsApp e acompanhe em tempo real as principais notícias do esporte\nRayssa também destaca a responsabilidade e a experiência adquiridas ao longo dos anos, prometendo apresentar manobras diferentes e inovadoras para o público que acompanhará o evento.\n— Outro dia tinha 14 anos e, agora, já estou com 17. Apesar da pouca idade, há muita responsabilidade e muita experiência também. Já tenho duas Olimpíadas e outros tantos campeonatos. Ou seja, quase tudo mudou e veremos muitas manobras diferentes aqui também — finalizou.\nSTU Pro Tour\nA etapa de Porto Alegre não apenas abre a temporada do STU Pro Tour de 2025, mas também sinaliza a expansão do evento, que contará com competições em outras cidades brasileiras como Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo, além de Cascais, em Portugal. A final do tour ainda está por ser definida, com possíveis sedes no Japão, China, Emirados Árabes Unidos ou Arábia Saudita.\nAlém de Rayssa Leal, o STU Pro Tour em Porto Alegre contará com a presença de skatistas de renome internacional, como a holandesa Keet Oldenbeuving, que também participou das últimas duas Olimpíadas. Esta será a quarta vez que a capital gaúcha recebe o evento, mas a primeira em que se configura como uma etapa internacional.",
