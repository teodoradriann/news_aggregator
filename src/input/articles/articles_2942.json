    "text": "NFL best dressed in Week 18: A look at which outfits shined brightest in final week of 2023 regular season\nIt’s the final week of the 2023 NFL regular season and the final game for many players in the league. While some teams entered Week 18 in a good spot, already locking down a playoff spot, a number of teams still needed a win and/or help from others to punch their ticket into the playoffs.\nSome players may be playing their final game on their current team ahead of free agency down the road. Some may even be playing their final football game ever, as many will step back and consider retirement this offseason.\nWith so much on the line and with the end of eras coming for many with their current franchise, this is a big week in the NFL. Players rose to the occasion and put on their best outfits to close off the regular season with a bang.\nHere are some of the best fits from across the league.\nSunday is likely three-time Super Bowl champion Matthew Slater’s final game in the league. The Patriots honored their longtime captain by wearing sweatshirts with his name before the game.\nSlater did not wear one of the sweatshirts, and instead honored another GOAT.\nIf this is Derrick Henry’s last game with the Tennessee Titans, he’s going out in style with his patterned denim set, the statement glasses and chains.\nBears wide receiver D.J. Moore is ready for winter weather.\nJeremiah Owusu-Koramoah’s fits never disappoint.\nCan someone let Jason Kelce know that flip flops are not the best shoe choice for the snow?",

    "text": "Kate Middleton : tout le monde a remarqué la même chose dans son dernier look à Balmoral Kate Middleton a ravi ses fans lors de son apparition à Balmoral, le 25 août 2024. Un détail sur son look a pourtant interpellé les internautes. Première fashion faux-pas pour Kate Middleton ? Kate Middleton passe une partie des vacances d’été à Balmoral, en Ecosse, en compagnie de quelques membres majeurs de la famille royale. La princesse de Galles et sa famille, après un séjour à Anmer Hall dans le Norfolk, ont rejoint le roi Charles III et Camilla ainsi que les Edimbourg à Balmoral. Le 25 août 2024, Kate Middleton fait une apparition surprise à l’église Crathie Kirk, près du château de Balmoral. La [ princesse de Galles](https://www.closermag.fr/royautes/cancer-de-kate-middleton-ce-signe-qui-ne-trompe-pas-dans-son-combat-face-a-la-maladie-3468985) avait opté pour une tenue élégante composée d’un trench-coat à carreaux marron de la marque Holland Cooper et un chapeau à plumes de chez Hicks & Brown. Kate Middleton : la princesse de Galles très couverte à l’église Le manteau et le [ chapeau de Kate Middleton](https://www.closermag.fr/royautes/kate-middleton-son-chapeau-fedora-fetiche-disponible-a-la-vente-quel-est-son-prix-3470776) sont parfaits en eux-mêmes. L’épouse du prince William, toujours en convalescence à cause de son traitement contre le cancer, était sublime. Bavarde et souriante, elle a été aperçue aux côtés du prince de Galles du côté du siège passager à l’entrée de l’église de Crathie Kirk. Manteau et chapeau Fedora, le [ look de Kate Middleton](https://www.closermag.fr/royautes/kate-middleton-atteinte-dun-cancer-la-princesse-fait-une-rare-apparition-au-cote-de-son-mari-le-prince-william-3469735), pour une fois, n’a pas fait l’unanimité auprès de ses fans. Nombreux sont ceux qui se sont demandé pourquoi en plein mois d’août, la princesse de Galles, qui n’est pas encore sortie d’affaires, compte tenu de son cancer, était très couverte. Kate Middleton : sa tenue hivernale est parfaitement de circonstance Le choix vestimentaire de Kate Middleton lors de sa dernière apparition à Balmoral n'a rien d'une bourde, ni d'un choix dicté par son état de santé. Bien que l'été soit encore présent dans l'hémisphère nord, ce choix vestimentaire de la [ princesse de Galles](https://www.grazia.fr/people/kate-middleton-atteinte-dun-cancer-elle-fait-une-apparition-surprise-pour-une-bonne-raison-1106911.html) était tout à fait intentionnel, comme le souligne Purepeople dans son article du 28 août 2024. \"Alors, il fait froid toute l'année au Royaume-Uni ? \", s’est demandé un fan sur les réseaux sociaux. \"C’est déjà l’automne ?\", s’est étonné un autre. Purepeople explique que si la température moyenne est de 23°C à Londres, elle est généralement plus fraîche en Ecosse. Le dimanche 25 août dernier était prévu pour être une journée nuageuse, avec des températures allant de 9°C à 16°C. RÉAGISSEZ [Annuler la réponse.](/royautes/kate-middleton-tout-le-monde-a-remarque-la-meme-chose-dans-son-dernier-look-a-balmoral-3471227#respond) - Claire Sur les images on a aussi vu les habitants avec des gros manteaux d’hiver, et les hommes avec des bonnets sur la tête, et des blousons. On est au nord de l’Ecosse, je ne vois pas ce qu’il y a de surprenant dans la tenue de la princesse Catherine Middleton. Du temps de Lady Diana, on la voyait déjà habillée comme ça, ainsi que la reine Elisabeth II, quand on voyait des photos d’elle à Balmoral.",
