    "text": "7 Sneaky Ways Satan Stops You from Praying - [Janet Thompson](https://www.crosswalk.com/author/janet-thompson/)Crosswalk.com Contributing Writer - Updated Feb 26, 2024 We start our morning with good intentions to have our devotional or quiet time with the Lord, and then somehow, the day slips away before we ever get around to it. We promise ourselves we’ll make time to pray before bed, but then exhaustion or sleepiness overtakes us, and soon we’re sound asleep. Satan doesn’t want us praying and listening to our Father in Heaven, so he will use his emissaries to intervene, interfere, or interrupt our conversations with the Lord. Really, prayer is just that, a simple conversation with God. Talking to Him about praises, requests, concerns, feelings, hopes, dreams... and then listening for His still small voice answering us through the Holy Spirit. The more aware we become of Satan’s sneaky tactics to stop us from praying, the better prepared we’ll be to combat and conquer them. See if any of the following satanic ruses have happened to you, and consider trying some of the solutions offered to victory in praying with your Lord and Savior. You who love the Lord, hate evil! He protects the lives of his godly people and rescues them from the power of the wicked. Ps. 97:10 NLT Photo Credit: ©GettyImages/tommaso79 - 1. DistractionsSlide 1 of 8 A friend shared a quote from David Timms’ devotional Living the Lord’s [Prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/)that describes so well the nature of our spiritual lives today. He writes, “Spiritual ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) runs rampant among us. More and more of us seem unable to be still, to focus, to wait, or to listen . . . We hurry from appointment to phone call to email—or from school to shopping to sport—living distraction.” We do live in an era of extreme and excessive distractions. We sit down to have a time of prayer, and the phone rings, or we hear notifications for social media, games, texts, emails, or messages. The next-door neighbor starts mowing the lawn. The dog needs letting out. The timer beeps that breakfast is ready, and before we know it, we engage with the seen more than the unseen. We can’t see God face-to-face like we see the objects of our distraction. So, our time with God succumbs to distractions because we can’t see the hurt on His face or the shrug of His shoulders when we take care of the visible and slight the invisible. Often, good and necessary things distract our attention away from conversations with God, but our lives would be much less stressful and rushed if we didn’t yield to the tyranny of the urgent. Leave the phone in another room while praying. You can always answer a text later or return a phone call. Schedule prayer time on your calendar as a highlighted important appointment you can’t, and won’t, miss. It doesn’t always need to be in the morning, but it does always need to be daily. It was by [faith](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/)that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible.

Your Mind WandersSlide 2 of 8 You start to pray, and you begin thinking about your to-do list or a news report you just heard or read. Maybe what you’re going to make for dinner or a grocery list pops into your mind. A project at work or a problem with a co-worker or neighbor. Satan is not [omniscient](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/spiritual-life/what-is-omniscience-and-what-does-it-mean-for-me.html); he can’t know what we’re thinking. But he does know how to put thoughts in our minds while we’re trying to keep our thoughts on omniscient God. The good news is that we have the power within us to overcome the mind attacks of the enemy trying to invade our thoughts. One way is to write down your prayers in a [prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/)and praise journal. Writing keeps your mind engaged in actively recording your prayers. I like to put a line down the middle of the page with dated prayer requests on one side, and praises and answers to those prayers on the other side. Periodically, review your requests and note on the praise side how and when the Lord answered. This is an encouragement to keep praying because sometimes we forget we even prayed about things or, unfortunately, we forget to thank God and give Him the glory for His answers. Also, keep a notepad nearby to jot down those to-dos or project ideas so you won’t forget them, and then continue praying. Another way to keep your mind from wandering is to say your prayers aloud. Literally, have a conversation with God that doesn't become one-sided. Stop at times and listen to what He might be saying back to you. Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.

InterruptionsSlide 3 of 8 If children in the house or other family members need your attention while you’re praying, it can be frustrating. Susanna Wesley was the mother of 19 children, ten of which lived beyond infancy including future Methodist [pastors](https://www.crosswalk.com/church/pastors-or-leadership/)John and Charles Wesley. The story goes that when she was young, she promised the Lord she would match any hours spent in entertainment with hours of [prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/). But with such a large family to manage, there was no time for entertainment so she then promised God to devote two hours to prayer daily. Susanna trained her children that when she sat in a chair with the Bible in her lap and put her apron up over her head, mommy was praying so don’t interrupt until she’s done, unless it’s a real emergency. Helping family learn to respect and honor your prayer time is a fabulous way to demonstrate the sacredness of prayer. You can also encourage family members to pray with you, teaching children or grandchildren the value of praying at an early age. Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it. Pr. 22:6 Photo Credit: ©iStock/Getty Images Plus/fizkes - 4. Chaos and NoiseSlide 4 of 8 This sneaky way might be a hard one to overcome, too. I know it is for me because it involves the first of Satan’s sly ways we discussed: distractions. I’m easily distracted. I need silence when I’m writing or doing my [devotionals](https://www.crosswalk.com/devotionals/). I must find a quiet place to pray. Some people refer to this as their [prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/)closet. For others, it means rising before the rest of the family or waiting until after they’ve all gone to bed to pray. If the weather is nice, you might go outside, but the key is to have a quiet place for you and the Lord to meet each day. Even “Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed” ( [Luke 5:16](https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/5-16.html)). Turn off all electronics and allow yourself the blessing of uninterrupted time with your precious Lord and Savior. Some people like to play praise music while they pray, and that really infuriates Satan because he cannot be in the presence of worship, which is why most churches begin their service with a time of worship in song. It not only prepares our hearts for the pastor’s message but also clears Satan out of the sanctuary. Another way to overcome this sneaky, noisy attempt of Satan to invade our prayers is to pray about everything in the moment. We long for a concentrated, quiet time of prayer with God, and we should have those extended prayer conversations, but we can also pray in the midst of the noise and chaos. I once heard a pastor suggest that we send up two-minute prayers to God throughout our day. While we’re eating breakfast, getting ready for work, showering, driving, cooking, working, cleaning the house, working in the yard, doing laundry, exercising… offer short prayers and praises to God continuously throughout our day. Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. [1 Thess. 5:16-18](https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-thessalonians/passage/?q=1 thessalonians+5:16-18) Photo Credit: ©GettyImages/FG Trade Latin - 5. DoubtSlide 5 of 8 Doubt is the antithesis of faith and is a favorite tool of Satan. Starting in the Garden of Eden, when the serpent asked Eve that famous question that caused her to doubt God’s goodness, “Did God really say?” ( [Gen. 3:1](https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/3-1.html)), Satan has used doubt to come between God and His people ever since. But a powerful truth is that if we grow our faith, our doubts will wither. When it comes to our prayers, Satan will twist some truths to plant doubts in our minds, but God’s Word always counters Satan’s lies. When Satan questions: How do you know God’s listening or will answer? Now this is the confidence that we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him. [1 John 5:14-15](https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-john/passage/?q=1 john+5:14-15) Satan: You don’t know how to pray. In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. [Rom. 8:26](https://www.biblestudytools.com/romans/8-26.html) Satan: God already knows what you need so why bother to pray about it? If He wants to give it to you, He will in His own time. He can read your mind. In [Matthew 6:7-8](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+6:7-8)Jesus assures us, “And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.” Then Jesus gave us The Lord’s [Prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/)in [Matthew 6:9-13](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+6:9-13)instructing exactly how to pray. When in doubt, follow this format. “This, then, is how you should pray: “‘ [Our Father](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/the-lords-prayer-be-encouraged-and-strengthened.html)in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’” Photo Credit: ©GettyImages/Ridofranz - 6. GuiltSlide 6 of 8 A favorite ploy of Satan is to fill our hearts and minds with guilt over our past sins, decisions, or maybe even current events in our lives. As Christians, we know God doesn’t use guilt to motivate us. When we accept Jesus as our Savior, ask for forgiveness, and repent from our sins, God wipes our sin-slate clean ( [1 John 1:9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-john/1-9.html), [Is. 1:18](https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/1-18.html)). But Satan likes to remind us how bad we once were. [Prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/)is the perfect weapon to cast both Satan and the guilt out of our minds and hearts, especially when he whispers in our ears some of these taunts. Satan: You are weak, and your sins make you unworthy to pray. Our response: It’s true there is no one [righteous](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/spiritual-life/what-does-it-mean-to-be-righteous.html)or worthy, but praise God, there is grace. For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard. 24 Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins. [Rom. 3:23-24](https://www.biblestudytools.com/romans/passage/?q=romans+3:23-24)NLT If we’ve sinned recently, we confess our sins to God in prayer. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. [1 John 1:9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-john/1-9.html) Satan: Why would God listen to you? Like Nehemiah, we pray earnestly: “O Lord, please hear my prayer! Listen to the prayers of those of us who delight in honoring you.” (1:11 NLT) Like David, we praise God for He answers all our prayers. What mighty praise, O God, belongs to you in Zion. We will fulfill our vows to you, for you to answer our prayers. All of us must come to you. Though we are overwhelmed by our sins, you forgive them all. [Ps. 65:1-3](https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/passage/?q=psalms+65:1-3)NLT Satan: You don’t have enough faith for God to pay attention to you? “You don’t have enough faith,” Jesus told them. “I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it would move. Nothing would be impossible.” [Matt. 17:20](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/17-20.html)NLT Photo Credit: ©iStock/Getty Images Plus/fizkes - 7. Exhaustion or LazinessSlide 7 of 8 There’s a difference between exhaustion and laziness. Sometimes we fall asleep while praying, and that’s okay because we’re tired. God understands our need for rest and refreshment. If this happens often, it could be Satan trying to block your prayers, so don’t pray lying down and start earlier in the evening or as soon as you wake up in the morning. Laziness and a nonchalant attitude about praying is definitely a work of the enemy to keep you from using one of the most powerful weapons Christians have against Satan: [prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/). God says the gate into heaven is narrow. Few understand the significance of that statement. He also says that the weeds of the world will overtake the gospel seed planted in some hearts. Don’t let that be you! You want to have hearts of flourishing gospel seed. Prayer is like water and fertilizer to the maturing of your [faith](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/). Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they sprouted, grew, and produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!” Then he said, “Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.” [Mark 4:8-9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/passage/?q=mark+4:8-9)NLT Photo Credit: © Getty Images/Ridofranz - Join a Prayer Group or Have a Prayer PartnerSlide 8 of 8 God hears the prayers of each person, but if you find yourself struggling in your [prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/)life, consider asking a friend or relative to be a prayer partner with you. Set aside specific times where you can be together to pray either in person, on the phone, facetime, or even zoom. I recently joined a Monday morning MyFaithVotes Zoom prayer hour where we come together from all over the nation to pray for the nation. What a powerful way to start the week. Maybe God is calling you to start a prayer group at your church or neighborhood where you meet and share your prayer requests and praises. Our church is small enough that we actually have a time of corporate prayer and praise during the service, and we receive prayer lists to pray for each other during the week. There’s also a time of prayer on Thursday afternoons, and everyone is welcome to join. We begin our Couple’s Bible Study group with a time of praying over requests and praises. Start your prayer time with a prayer something like this: In Your Name, Lord Jesus, I claim protection against any distractions, thoughts or emotions, interruptions, chaos or noise, doubt, guilt, laziness, or exhaustion inserted in my life by Satan. I seal off any opportunity for them to influence or affect any part of me or my prayer time. I declare myself spirit, mind, emotions, body, and will, totally open to your voice and totally available to do your will alone. Kylie Jean Tannehill reminds us, “The devil isn’t creative; he’s just strategic. You don’t have to fall for his tactics; they’re old as time. We already have the game plan for the tactics of the enemy; it’s time to recognize the authority we carry in Jesus!” May we shout for joy when we hear of your victory and raise a victory banner in the name of our God. May the Lord answer all your prayers. [Ps. 20:5](https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/20-5.html)NLT Related Resource: How to “Work Out Your [Salvation](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/spiritual-life/what-is-salvation-also-why-it-s-needed-and-how-to-get-it.html)with Fear and Trembling” Life can be really hard if you are trying to figure out how to follow God in your everyday life. What is God's work in our life, and what is our work is in our life? As Nicole reminds us on this episode of How to Study the Bible, knowing the difference makes all the difference!

    "text": "The 10th edition of the annual 'Open Churches Weekend' is in full swing, with this year's theme focusing on flowers and plants.\n58 churches and chapels are taking part with the aim of boosting religious cultural heritage.\nNot only will various churches exceptionally open their doors to the public, but a cultural programme will also be offered in 21 churches and chapels. This ranges from workshops, exhibitions and special visits to musical entertainment.\nIn Ehlange-sur-Mess, for example, an after-work event with DJs was organised in the church on Friday evening.\nIn Kaundorf, a theatre play is performing around the St. Pirmin church. A dozen actors take the guests on a journey through the centuries. The play tells the story of St Pirmin, who is said to have healed his eyes in the spring on the Përmesknupp.\nAnother chapel that is exceptionally open this weekend is the Loretto Chapel in Clervaux. It was built in the 18th century by Count Clervaux, who wanted to create a place of pilgrimage for people to share their grievances with St Mary of Loretto. The room in the chapel is built in the late baroque rococo style and there are many floral and plant motifs.\nOn Sunday, 2 June, you can visit a whole series of churches. The whole programme can be found on\nwww.oppekierchen.lu.",

    "title": "How To Get Rid Of Spider Mites: 7 Tips",
    "text": "If your once-vigorous plant is starting to look sickly, spider mites may be the culprits. These tiny, plant-feeding arachnids hide in plain sight. At first, your plant may look a little “off,” but you may not be able to identify what’s going on because the teeny pests, which are related to spiders and ticks, are hard to see if you don’t know what you’re looking for.\nWithin short order, these pests multiply and wreak havoc on both indoor and outdoor plants, including annuals, perennials, edibles, and shrubs. “Spider mites suck small amounts of liquids and tissue from plants, causing light-colored stipples on the green leaves,” says Matt Bertone, PhD, entomologist and director of the NC State Plant Disease and Insect Clinic. “In large populations, the areas of damage can spread, giving plants a dull, greasy or yellow appearance. It’s usually about that time when people find the colonies of these pests under the leaves.” Large infestations kill a plant.\nTypically, you see damage to the plant before you notice the mites. “Most often, you may suspect a different pest, but it’s actually mites, which is why observation is really important,” says Rafia Khan, PhD, assistant professor and extension entomologist at Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center. “You will notice mottling or bronzing of the leaves, but when you look closely, you may see fine silk webbing, too.” You also may be able to see the mites moving around inside the webbing.\nThere are many different species of spider mites but the most common in the Southeast is the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), says Bertone. This species feeds on a wide variety of plants. Other common spider mites include boxwood mite (Eurytetranychus buxi), spruce spider mite (Oligonychus ununguis), and the southern red mite (Oligonychus ilicis).\n- Matt Bertone, PhD, is an entomologist and director of the NC State Plant Disease and Insect Clinic.\n- Rafia Khan, PhD, is an assistant professor and extension entomologist at Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center.\nHow To Identify Spider Mites\nSpider mites live in colonies. They have no wings and are about .5mm in length, making them difficult to see with the naked eye, says Bertone. You may be able to see them with a 10 to 15x magnifying glass. They’re small, oval and have eight legs as adults. Hatchlings have only six legs. Different species are different colors, but most are pale, red or spotted. They’re especially common during hot, dry conditions.\nUnderstanding Spider Mites\nThe life cycle of these pests is rapid. Spider mite adults can lay several hundreds of eggs over a 2 to 4 week period, so you are often dealing with multiple generations at once during a severe infestation, says Khan. After the eggs hatch, every stage is mobile and can quickly spread to nearby plants.\nOutdoors, organisms, such as predators and fungi regulate populations. But in the dry indoor environment inside your house, these mites can attain huge populations due to the absence of anything to keep them in check, says Bertone.\nHow To Get Rid Of Spider Mites\nThese insidious pests can kill a plant (and spread to other plants) if left unchecked, so try these management tips from Bertone and Khan:\n- Inspect your plants. “You should regularly monitor your plants, not just when they are infested. This is especially important when you are bringing new plants indoors,” says Khan. Use a magnifying glass, and look on the underside of foliage where mites like to hide.\n- Watch for yellow, stippled leaves, especially on flowering or fruiting plants. If you see these telltale signs, make a closer inspection for the webbing.\n- Isolate infected houseplants. If you find mites on a houseplant, immediately move this plant away from others to prevent their spread.\n- Blast them off with a spray from the hose. This old-school trick is surprisingly effective. Use a garden hose, kitchen or shower sprayer to wash off every surface of the plant, including the tops and bottoms of foliage and in between leaves and branches. Pay special attention to areas of webbing, which protect the mites.\n- Repeat the spray. Because these mites reproduce rapidly and you’re often dealing with more than generation at a time, you must repeat the process every week to 10 days to deal with newly-hatched eggs or any mites you missed.\n- Limit pesticide use. Unfortunately, these pests quickly become resistant to some insecticides so that you may experience an even more severe outbreak. Therefore, reserve the use of these products for extreme infestations on high-value plants. Use\ninsecticidal soap,neem or horticultural oils, or Spinosad, and follow label instructions. Make sure to cover every surface of the plant, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices between stems. You may need to re-treat within a week or so. - Know when to call it quits. If you have treated a plant several times and are not making any headway, it may be time to cut your losses and toss the plant before others become infected.",
