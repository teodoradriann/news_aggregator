    "text": "Feast of the Holy Family: Reflect on the Biblical Vision of the Domestic Church User’s Guide to Sunday, Dec. 31 Sunday, Dec. 31, is the feast of the the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Mass readings: [Sirach 3:2-6, 12-14](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/sirach/3?2) or [Genesis 15:1-6; 21:1-3](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/genesis/15?1); [Psalm 128:1-2, 3, 4-5](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/psalms/128?1) or [Psalm 105:1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 8-9](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/psalms/105?1); [Colossians 3:12-21 or 3:12-17](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/colossians/3?12) or [Hebrews 11:8, 11-12, 17-19](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/hebrews/11?8); [Luke 2:22-40](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/luke/2?22) or [Luke 2:22, 39-40](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/luke/2?22). Here in the middle of the Christmas Octave, the Church bids us to celebrate the feast of the Holy Family and to reflect on the biblical vision of family. Let us consider the family and marriage along three lines: structure, struggles and strategy. Structure: All through the readings for today’s Mass we are instructed on the basic form, the basic structure of the family. In these passages we see the family includes a father in honor over his children and a wife and mother who is supportive of her husband. The husband clings to his wife, preserving union with her and the children. He also supports, loves and encourages his wife and confirms her authority over the children. Children are to honor and obey their parents as the parents instruct and admonish their children, not in a way that badgers or discourages them, but encourages them and builds them up. Indeed, the whole family structure is ordered to helping children advance in wisdom and age and in favor before God and man. Struggles: This picture is, sadly, rare. It is clear that the family is in crisis today, and it is also clear that it is children who suffer the most. The modern Western world displays a mentality that is both deeply flawed and gravely harmful to children. This includes sins such as cohabitation, fornication, abortion, adultery, homosexual acts, pornography, the sexualization of children and the sexual abuse of children. Add to this the widespread acceptance of contraception, which has facilitated the illusion of sex without consequences and promoted the lie that there is no necessary connection between children and sexual relations, of the necessity of marriage. The rebellion of many adults against the plan and order of God has caused endless grief and hardship and created a culture that is poisonous to the family, the dignity of the individual and the proper raising and blessing of children. Strategy: What are we to do? Preach the word! Whatever the sins of this present generation (and there are many), we must be prepared to unambiguously repropose the wisdom of God’s word. We cannot hesitate to announce God’s plan for sexuality, marriage and family. Our strategic proclamation must include certain key elements. There must be no sex before marriage, ever, under any circumstances. There are no exceptions to this. Children deserve and have the right to expect two parents, a father and mother, committed to each other until death do them part. Anything short of this is a grave injustice to children and a mortal sin before God. We must return to a vision that marriage is about what is best for children, not adults. Married couples must learn to work out their differences (as was done in the past) and not resort to divorce, which offends God (Malachi 2:16). We must restore the understanding that the needs of children far outweigh the preferences, “rights” and needs of adults. Whatever personal failings of any of us in this present evil age (Galatians 1:4), our strategy must be to preach the undiluted plan of God for sexuality, marriage and family to our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We must not allow any personal shame for our shortcomings to silence what God’s word teaches because God has a holy plan for marriage and family.

During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 42 people and wounded 163 others, bringing the total death toll to 40,265 and injuries to 93,144 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, it added. There are still a number of victims trapped under the rubble and scattered on roads, as ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them, it said. \"Critical water wells and sanitation infrastructure have been repeatedly damaged throughout the war,\" the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said on social media platform X on Thursday. \"With overcrowding, lack of hygiene and unbearable heat, access to clean water continues to be a struggle in the Gaza Strip,\" it added. Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage.",

    "title": "We Asked the Experts for 2024 Kitchen Trends, and Boy, They Delivered",
    "text": "I don’t know about you, but I’m claiming 2024 as the year of the dinner party. Truly, few things are better than having all of your besties over, whipping up a viral TikTok recipe, and getting wine drunk in the process. These are the best types of girls’ nights, IMHO. But, the thing is…you can’t have a killer dinner party in a subpar kitchen.\nLuckily, even if you’re a renter, there are plenty of ways to spruce up your kitchen and make it “wow, you actually live here?” chic, many of which don’t involve blowing major $$$. How, you ask? Well, I’ve got all the answers—and tips and tricks—because I spoke with a bunch of professional interior designers to bring you the top kitchen trends of 2024. All of these additions (both big and small) will turn your kitchen into the ultimate hangout spot—and your favorite room ever.\n“Kitchens are said to be the heart of the home, and 2024 is the year we really live that, because the biggest trends in the year ahead are anchored in connection and intention,” says therapist turned interior designer and author of Home Therapy, Anita Yokota.\nIf you’re ready for your kitchen to be the most enviable out of all your pals, keep reading, because the seven kitchen trends ahead will help turn your space into an oasis this year. Who knows, HGTV may just come knocking at your door…\nStatement Range Hoods\na kitchen with white cabinets\nRenters, scroll on by, because this upgrade is specifically for the homeowners…specifically those who are willing to drop a bit of moolah to make their kitchen sparkle. Trust me when I say your kitchen is worthy of a splurge, and the experts assured me that a statement range hood is super on-trend right now, but will never go out of style. “The stove (especially when oversized and custom) is often the focal point of the kitchen, and statement hoods are becoming the accent,” says interior designer, luxury stager, and CEO of Staged to Sell Home, Jason Saft. “Consider them like jewelry for your kitchen.”\nAnd these practical pieces don’t just look nice—if you regularly like to chef it up, a stove hood is a necessity for removing airborne grease, fumes, smoke, and heat, so you won’t experience a major oopsie while cooking or entertaining. (It’s a wee bit embarrassing accidentally setting off the fire alarm while searing a steak, no?)\nTo add depth and warmth to your kitchen, Saft recommends a metallic hood, like brass or copper, but you can really go with any color that makes your heart smile. “If you have the opportunity to do something that stands out, go for it, just make sure other elements in the kitchen are toned down so they don’t compete,” adds Saft. Charleston-based interior designer Allison Park Blake recommends using a website like Hoodsley to customize every aspect of your new centerpiece—you’ll be able to choose the width, shape, finish, and more—without breaking the bank.\nDedicated Coffee Stations\na white shelf with objects on it\nLast year, designers saw a boom in designated coffee alcoves, and according to Saft, this trend is only gaining steam(ed milk, lol). “People must be tired of driving to Starbucks, because I’m seeing so many built-in coffee stations that feature professional-grade espresso machines and multiple ways to brew a fresh cup,” he says.\nConsidering TikTok has put an emphasis on crafting a calming morning routine, bringing the cozy café vibes home makes sense—I mean, who wants to wait in ridiculous coffee shop lines when you can brew a better cup from the comfort of your casa? And think about all the money you’ll save by becoming your own barista!\n“You don’t need to have custom millwork or expensive machines to designate an area of your kitchen for your cup of joe,” promises Saft. “Just map out a little nook and break out some of your fanciest dishes for sugar and other coffee accessories.” And if you’re short on space, think about converting your bar cart into a coffee bar cart—that’s exactly what I’ve been doing as I explore a sober-curious lifestyle. Instead of booze, my bar cart is now home to my trusty espresso machine and gorgeous mugs. Plus, I love displaying my favorite craft coffee bags like they’re little works of art.\nColorful Cabinetry\na kitchen with blue cabinets\nSomeone failed to give Kim K the memo that boring, all-beige kitchens are out and incorporating color is in (sorry Kim, love you). After all, kitchens aren’t meant to feel stark and sterile like a hospital. If the 2024 trends are teaching us anything, it’s that your culinary space should be the most welcoming area of your house, so take this as your sign to break out the paint.\nAccording to Havenly lead interior designer and design director Heather Goerzen, neutral cabinets and all-white kitchens are fading out of style. (Honestly, bless.) “Bold and moody cabinetry in shades like dark green, dark blue, ochre, and warm walnut are taking white’s place, adding saturation and personality to cook spaces,” she says.\nNow, we’re not suggesting choosing a hot pink shade (although if that’s your vibe, we’re all for embracing your Barbie-core dreams). But if you’re not ready to fully commit to colorful cabinets, Blake mentions that having a mix of stained and painted finishes can also add warmth to the space. “The contrast of finishes will really make things pop.”\nCustom Cabinets for Optimized Storage\na kitchen with white cabinets\nRegardless of how often I try to organize, I end up dealing with a Tupperware avalanche at least once a week. And after talking with my friends, this seems to be a seriously common issue. Luckily, there’s a simple solution that designers are obsessed with and encouraging all of their clients to consider: customized cabinets that fit every last item.\n“In the ’50s, cupboards and fridges had way more bells and whistles than they do today. As the decades unfolded, however, the story became about cramming as much cabinetry into the kitchen as you could. 2024 is a return to storage that not only works, but is custom to you,” says Yokota.\nBeyond Tupperware, isn’t it so frustrating when your delicately blown Italian coup glasses or even your beloved Stanley cups are just a tad bit too tall to fit on the shelf? (Sidenote: Why are Stanley cups too big for every cabinet?!) Yokota says that creating specific zones that flawlessly fit your unique drinkware collection (and other types of items, of course) can be a minor addition that makes a world of a difference.\nIf you can’t completely customize your cabinets, purchasing mini organizers—like a wine glass or pot lid holder—can make you feel like an organization queen. And the peace of mind you’ll experience knowing that everything has a spot is absolutely priceless.\nVintage Touches\na kitchen with a chandelier\nGet in ladies, we’re going thrifting…but instead of seeking out the perfect pair of lived-in jeans, we’re looking for hand-me-down items that will make your kitchen feel oh-so homey. “Mixing antique materials—like vintage countertop lamps, brass hardware, and retro-looking fixtures—with modern kitchen finishes can give the space a warm and inviting feel,” says Blake.\nHomeGoods Style Expert Ursula Carmona urges you to think outside of the box by picking unique decor pieces you’d normally use in a bedroom or living room. “Look for ceramic table lamps and glass décor accents to set the tone of space, and then pick up things like marble decorative boxes to store knick-knacks, velvet picture frames to hide outlets, and small metal catch-all trays to hold your oil and vinegar assortment.”\nYokota also loves the idea of adding antique light fixtures to “maximize style.” And I say go big or go home: If you find an eye-catching brass or gold chandelier that looks like it belongs in Jay Gatsby’s mansion, you probably need it for your kitchen.\nMultipurpose Kitchen Islands\na kitchen with white cabinets\nYou may have the comfiest couch of all your friends and family, but people aren’t hanging out in the living room this year! Yokota predicts that all of the magic is going to happen around the kitchen island. “In 2024, we’re seeing far more of what I call ‘connection islands,'” she explains. “This approach takes the island from a space where we cook to a space where we connect with our family.”\nBecause the island is the new go-to place for gathering, you’ll want major appliances as well as little luxuries to be focused in this area. Yokota suggests placing your sink on the island, so you can face and interact with your guests while cooking and cleaning; adding comfortable seating (those plush velvet bar stools you’ve been eyeing will be perfect!); and maybe even including a mini pull-out fridge for easy drink grabbing. “When we put connection at the heart of this room, we deepen the way we feel about our homes,” adds Yokota. Love that for us!\nAll Wood Everything\na vase with flowers on a counter\nLove an all-natural look? Try adding woody touches to your cuisine (that’s kitchen in French, duh). “People want their kitchen to feel like a hub that everyone wants to spend time in. Knowing that wood pieces can evoke such a feeling of centrality and comfort, I think everyone will continue to be more and more drawn to this design trend,” shares Carmona. “Wood accents instantly warm up a space and make the room feel more inviting,” she adds, which is a great contrast to the normally somewhat chaotic kitchen energy.\nThis is probs one of the easiest trends to incorporate, because no renovations are required! No need to chop wood (unless you wanna)—just pick up little accents and incorporate them in your space, whether they be cutting boards, vases, or bar stools.",

    "text": "Tony Khan is making his feelings known regarding WWE PR.\nAll Elite Wrestling President Tony Khan recently participated in the ROH Death Before Dishonor Media Call . When asked about the report that AEW’s new media rights deal with WBD has been agreed to in principle, Khan said that isn’t the case.\n“Well, we’re having great talks, it’s still in conversation,” Tony Khan said. “So I think that would be premature to say that we’re all set and done because that’s still what we’re working on. So we’re having great talks, including today. And we’ve had some great meetings with the executive team, Mr. Zaslav, Kathleen Finch, Bruce Campbell, and great people at Warner Bros Discovery.\n“They’ve put a lot of time in and had a lot of great meetings and conversations. So it’s still something we’re all working on together. So yeah, I think it would be premature to say that for sure. But also important to note that it’s a very good ongoing dialog that we’re having.”\nMoments later, Khan decided to reveal these reports had gotten out this week due to the PR department of WWE. Khan isn’t sure why they continue to involve themselves in things that don’t concern them.\n“You know it’s interesting, I don’t usually do this, but since Brandon brought it up and asked,” Tony Khan said. “I had a major member of the wrestling media mention to me yesterday. WWE is telling people that, and I don’t know why WWE is telling people about our media rights deal.\nTony Khan says AEW’s new media rights deal will have a big increase over the previous one “I don’t know whether it’s any of their business, I don’t really understand why WWE PR calls people and talks about my business. WWE PR is telling people that the deal is done and that the deal is done at the same level that it was gonna be our previous deal. That’s not the case.\n“I don’t know why WWE PR and why major wrestling media members, who are very credible and have never lied to me, I don’t know why they are telling people that. It’s none of their business. I think WWE PR really gets involved in a lot of things they shouldn’t get involved in. And I can tell you that is very untrue.\n“When we make a deal for AEW, it’s going to be a great deal with a big increase over what we’ve been doing. We’re in a really good position and we’ve been doing great business here despite what they’re trying to do to us.”\nREAD MORE: Tony Khan: Bryan Danielson Is Planning To Stay With Us For A Long Time\nWhat do you make of Tony Khan’s comments? Do you find it odd that WWE PR continues to involve themselves in AEW’s business when they claim they aren’t competition?

    "text": "As demand for car batteries cools, companies developing technologies to store electricity in stationary batteries are attracting investor attention. These firms are developing alternatives to lithium-ion chemistries that they say will be better suited for the electrical grid and other stationary applications.\nAfter snagging a $150 million US Department of Energy (DOE) grant in September, Form Energy has raised more than $400 million from private investors to accelerate manufacturing and initial deployment of its iron-air batteries. Earlier this year, ESS Tech announced it would expand production of its long-duration iron flow batteries, and Eos Energy Enterprises secured $316 million to fund commercialization of a zinc-based battery.\nElectrical utilities use batteries to balance the supply of electricity with demand. Batteries can also provide backup power or store solar energy generated at midday for use in the evening.\nCurrently, the best option for these applications is usually a lithium-ion battery, says Allison Weis, the global head of storage for the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Lithium-ion battery systems can discharge electricity for up to a few hours at a time, but it’s expensive to use them to provide energy for longer than that.\nAs the amount of electricity generated by wind and solar increases, Weis says, batteries with other chemistries that can store energy for dozens of hours or days will become an important way to ensure that power is available continuously, even on cloudy or windless days.\n“Long term, it’s going to be the 5 minute and longer energy swings and uncertainty in renewables that will drive the need for the amount of storage we have coming online,” she says.\nESS and Eos say their batteries can provide power for up to 12 h, and Form’s battery can supply energy for up to 100 h. Some customers are starting to test them. ESS has installed batteries at airports, schools, and other locations; Eos batteries have discharged about 3.6 GW h of electricity so far, and six utility companies plan to start using Form’s battery by 2026.\nA 2023 DOE report concluded that long-duration batteries will be a key part of reducing emissions from electricity generation, but it noted that costs need to keep falling for the industry to be economically viable without government support.",
