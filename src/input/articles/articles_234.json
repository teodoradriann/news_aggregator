    "title": "No positives to be gleaned from CeeDee Lamb’s absence in Cowboys camp",
    "text": "As the great Monty Python once advised, “Always look on the bright side of life.” When suspicions were confirmed wide receiver CeeDee Lamb would not be attending Cowboys training camp amid a contract stalemate, the more positively-minded of the fanbase took that Monty Python advice to heart.\nA common spin some applied to the holdout situation is how it would open up practice rep opportunities for others down the depth chart. While it’s true the Cowboys are littered with inexperienced receivers desperate for snaps, it’s not exactly a beneficial transaction if it comes at the cost of snaps for Lamb.\nSnaps are valuable for even the most accomplished WRs in the NFL. Practice reps between quarterback and WR are important in improving timing and chemistry. Dak Prescott and Lamb aren’t starting from square one in this regard, but they can certainly still stand to improve.\nAn offer for Cowboys fans For the best local news, sports, entertainment and culture coverage, subscribe to the Austin American-Statesman. $1 for 6 months Cowboys LG Tyler Smith on CeeDee Lamb not being with the team in California: “He’s a huge part of everything we do, for sure. His presence will obviously be missed. But while he’s handling the things he has to handle, we have to handle business as well. The best thing we can do… pic.twitter.com/puDrXPjUIf\n— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) July 23, 2024\nLamb’s presence in camp can also serve as an example to others. Lamb runs routes and makes plays as well as anyone in the league. Getting a firsthand tutorial from the NFL’s best is undoubtedly beneficial for the young developing WR prospects down the roster. With Lamb absent, young players like Jalen Tolbert, Jalen Brooks, Jalen Moreno-Cropper and David Durden don’t get to see that real life example in front of them. One or two extra reps in practice do not make up for that.\npic.twitter.com/74bWLmyC3w\n— Defy (@defytalkcowboys) July 24, 2024\nThe Cowboys have a wildly unproven group of WRs behind Lamb on the roster. Aside from Brandin Cooks, no one has even a modest amount of experience. Working alongside an All-Pro like Lamb would prove useful for their development.\nIt helps the offense is expected to mostly stay the same. Mike McCarthy is in Year 5 of his deal in Dallas and aside from a few wrinkles here and there, is running the same offense in 2024.\nCowboys WR CeeDee Lamb getting work in Houston today.\nCeeDee Lamb on his contract: “it just has to make sense”, according to a source informed.\nI’m told he’s 195-196 lbs. bigger faster and more explosive than previous years. I’m told he had a two hour workout and continues to… pic.twitter.com/NFwlXcBFKT\n— Jane Slater (@SlaterNFL) July 25, 2024\nLamb is also busy working out on his own and has never displayed any characteristics that would make someone think he’s not taking his training seriously. Yet, nothing quite simulates real practice like real practice, so the sooner Lamb gets to Oxnard, the better.\nOf the three headlining players seeking new deals, Lamb’s situation appears to be the closest to getting done. When exactly is anyone’s guess but the parameters have been set by other top WRs over the offseason so there isn’t much to volley in the way of negotiations.\nMonty Python usually gives excellent life advice but in the case of this holdout, there isn’t a bright side. Hopefully there will be resolution soon.\nAn offer for Cowboys fans For the best local news, sports, entertainment and culture coverage, subscribe to the Austin American-Statesman. $1 for 6 months Articles 6 injured Cowboys (including Mazi Smith) cleared to begin camp, Diggs to PUP 'Dangling Participles': Jerry Jones not aligned with Cowboys fans' angst, 'That's not my life' Explaining IR, NFI, PUP (including Cowboys Trevon Diggs) designations, 2024 changes",

    "title": "With war raging in Gaza, Christmas is effectively cancelled in Bethlehem | National & World | kxly.com",
    "text": "Bethlehem, West Bank (CNN) — Church bells echo through the labyrinth-like streets of Bethlehem. With Christmas approaching, the city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank should be teeming with visitors. But this year, it is almost deserted. Local leaders made the decision last month to scale back festivities in solidarity with the Palestinian population, as heavy fighting raged between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel’s air and ground offensive, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza and nearly 85% of the strip’s total population has been displaced. The war was sparked by Hamas’ terror attack on October 7 on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. Many here have ties to Gaza through loved ones and friends, and a sense of misery has fallen upon the city revered by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Decorations that once adorned neighborhoods have been removed. The parades and religious celebrations have been canceled. In the city center, the traditional enormous Christmas tree of Manger Square is conspicuously absent. Traveling into Bethlehem, about eight kilometers south of Jerusalem, isn’t ordinarily an easy journey. The Israeli-built West Bank barrier restricts movement, as do the various checkpoints leading in and out of the city. It’s only got worse since Hamas’ brazen attack . Since October 7, Israel has restricted movement in Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the West Bank, with military checkpoints allowing access in and out, impacting Palestinians trying to get to work. The occupied territory has also experienced a surge in violence, with at least 300 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Palestinian health ministry. “My son asked me why there’s no Christmas tree this year, I don’t know how to explain it,” Ali Thabet tells CNN. He and his family live in Al Shawawra, a Palestinian village near Bethlehem, and visit each Christmas “because our relationship with our Christian brothers is a strong relationship He and his family live in Bethlehem and visit each Christmas “because our relationship with our Christian brothers is a strong relationship.” He explains: “We join them in their celebrations, and they also join us in our celebrations. But this year’s holiday season is very bad.” Walking down the cobble-stone streets, the impact of the conflict is evident. Businesses were banking on a busy festive period after suffering through the hardships and travel restrictions of the coronavirus pandemic. But without the usual crowds of tourists and the faithful, many of the hotels, shops and restaurants have shuttered. Bethlehem’s economy depends on pilgrims and tourism, explains third-generation shop owner Rony Tabash, who stands outside his store waiting for customers who will never arrive. Souvenirs and intricately carved olive wood carvings of the nativity scene sit on shelves gathering dust. Tabash’s store is one of the handful to remain open, out of a wish to support the skilled artisans that delicately make his merchandise. Tabash brings his father with him to the shop each day to get him out of the house. His grandfather opened the store back in 1927 and this place, along with the square and its famous church, have become “part of our heart.” “We’ve never seen Christmas like this,” he continues. “Since three months, honestly, we don’t have one sale. I don’t want to keep my father at home. I don’t want to give up hope.” Even the [Church of the Nativity](https://www.cnn.com/2012/06/13/middleeast/gallery/bethlehem-church-of-nativity/index.html) – which became the first World Heritage site in the Palestinian territories in 2012 – is largely empty. In a normal year, queues of hundreds would snake around the car park outside with pilgrims patiently waiting to enter its grotto, considered since the 2nd Century to be the exact location of Christ’s birth. A 14-pointed silver star set into the marble floor marks the precise spot where Jesus is said to have been born. In the 4th Century, Emperor Constantine [founded a church on the site](https://www.cnn.com/2012/06/29/world/meast/palestinian-bethlehem-heritage-site/index.html), which was destroyed in the year 529, only to be replaced by larger structures, which form the basis of the church today. Inside, it would usually be standing room only. But this year, the fighting in Gaza has changed everything. Now, you can practically hear a pin drop. “I have never seen it like this,” says Father Spiridon Sammour, a Greek Orthodox priest at the Church of the Nativity. “Christmas is joy, love and peace. We have no peace. We have no joy,” he says solemnly. “It is out of our hands, and we pray for the leaders who will make the decisions [all] over the world to God to help them, give them his light to make peace here and all over the world.

Yahoo Life Shopping 'Makes my poinsettia happy!' This $8 grow light will help your houseplants survive the dark winter Patrick Hearn · Deals Writer, Tech Updated December 29, 2023 at 1:01 AM 2 Link Copied Read full article\nIn theory, plants are easy to grow. They just need heat, light, and water — but two of those three things can be hard to come by in winter, when the short days tell plants it's time to go dormant (sort of like playing dead) and wait for spring. And who wants to look at a bunch of dormant plants all winter? A grow light can help. Specifically, a GYTF Halo Plant Grow Light . It's easy to set up, has a built-in timer, and will help breathe new life into your cold-weary greens until spring rolls back around. Oh, and it's only $8 right now at Amazon.\nGYTF GYTF Halo Plant Grow Light $8 $10 Save $2 with coupon This grow light comes with four different timing options, a sturdy pole that can be extended up to 18 inches and a lot of other features that make it a great buy — especially at this price.\nSave $2 with coupon $8 at Amazon Why is this a good deal? At just $10, this is a steal at full price — but the 15% on-page coupon makes it a no-brainer. One of these will help keep multiple plants happy and healthy.\nWhy do I need this? If you don't get a lot of natural light in your home, it can be tough to keep houseplants alive. This light produces a 6000K light (a neutral, warm temperature similar to sunlight) that plants relate to. It also has red and blue LEDs that help simulate the full spectrum of light, too. It's designed to be placed in the center of a ring of pots so you can provide light for multiple plants at once.\nThe timer can be set to four, eight, 12, or 18 hours, and it has an automatic on/off feature that means no manual intervention is required on your part. As your plants grow, you can increase the height of the light. It ranges from seven to 18 inches and can be rotated 180 degrees to give the best possible angle of light for the plants.\nIt only takes about ten seconds to set up, too! If you find that you relate to plants better than you do to technology, you don't have any reason to be intimidated by this. You can get it up and running in no time at all. Whether you have a small kitchen herb garden or you've brought outdoor plants in from the cold, these lights can help.\nThis GYTF light can keep your flora flourishing all year round. And for just $8? GTFO! (Amazon) What reviewers say\nOne green-thumbed shopper wrote , \"These lights are perfect for my small space. They come with a timer, which is so convenient. The light is bright without glare. The lights are supported by just sticking them into the plant pot. I am very pleased with this purchase.\"\n\"I like that the light is very bright for such a small and affordable light. It is enough light to help plants in an 8 foot radius grow. Timer works perfectly; I’m impressed!\" raved another fan.\n\"Used this light for a bonsai that had a very bad summer and I am trying to bring it back over the winter,\" related this amateur botanist . \"The one downside I have had with this light is that it only comes with a soil stake to hold it up so if you are using a loose soil like bonsai soil is it is very difficult to get the light to stay. I ended up 3D printing a small stand that works great but another option in the box would have been great.\"\n\"I was gifted a white poinsettia, and discovered that this light set to 14 hours makes my poinsettia HAPPY. The plant brightens up a dark room in my office, and running the light at night allows me to display it during the day,\" said one reviewer who understands that plants are basically little, green people.\nGYTF GYTF Halo Plant Grow Light $8 $10 Save $2 with coupon This grow light comes with four different timing options, a sturdy pole that can be extended up to 18 inches, and a lot of other features that make it a great buy — especially at this price.\nSave $2 with coupon $8 at Amazon The reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\nIf you have Amazon Prime , you’ll get free shipping, of course.
