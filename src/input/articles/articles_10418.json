Epub 2022 Feb 16. PMID:\n35170783\nShervin G Hoseini\nBACKGROUND: Melatonin, the major secretion of the pineal gland, has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and might advantage heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by attenuating the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic system on the heart besides its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.\nHYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that oral melatonin might improve echocardiographic parameters, serum biomarkers, and a composite clinical outcome (including quality of life, hospitalization, and mortality) in patients with HFrEF.\nMETHODS: A placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted on patients with stable HFrEF. The intervention was 10 mg melatonin or placebo tablets administered every night for 24 weeks. Echocardiography and measurements of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro BNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipid profile, and psychological parameters were done at baseline and after 24 weeks.\nRESULTS: Overall, 92 patients were recruited, and 85 completed the study (melatonin: 42, placebo: 43). Serum NT-Pro BNP decreased significantly in the melatonin compared with the placebo group (estimated marginal means for difference [95% confidence interval]: 111.0 [6.2-215.7], p = .044). Moreover, the melatonin group had a significantly better clinical outcome (0.93 [0.18-1.69], p = .017), quality of life (5.8 [0.9-12.5], p = .037), and New York Heart Association class (odds ratio: 12.9 [1.6-102.4]; p = .015) at the end of the trial. Other studied outcomes were not significantly different between groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral melatonin decreased NT-Pro BNP and improved the quality of life in patients with HFrEF. Thus it might be a beneficial supplement in HFrEF.\n [Heart Failure : CK(1240) : AC(183)](/disease/heart-failure) [Cardioprotective : CK(5377) : AC(1675)](/pharmacological-action/cardioprotective)",

    "text": "Lucknow, Feb 19 (SocialNews.XYZ) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday hit out at the opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) over its alleged attempts to defame the ongoing Mahakumbh in Prayagraj with baseless and misleading claims.\nAddressing the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on the second day, Yogi Adityanath delivered a sharp rebuttal to the Opposition's allegations surrounding Mahakumbh and said that it was not a government or party event but rather a celebration of society.\nThe Chief Minister emphasised that while the House was engaged in discussion, more than 56.25 crore devotees had taken a dip at the sacred Triveni Sangam.\nHe criticised the Opposition's alleged attempts to spread rumours with misleading videos targeting Sanatan Dharma, Ganga, the Hindu faith and the Mahakumbh.\n\"Such actions are not just an attack on Sanatan beliefs but a direct affront to the faith of 56 crore devotees and the spiritual essence of India itself,\" CM Yogi remarked in the House.\nHe further stated: \"The Mahakumbh is not an event tied to any particular party or government but a grand celebration of society.\"\nThe government's role, he emphasised, is that of a humble facilitator, dedicated to fulfilling its responsibilities with the utmost sincerity.\n\"We see ourselves as servants entrusted with this duty and will discharge it with complete commitment. Our deep reverence for India’s eternal traditions makes it our responsibility to honor and uphold them,\" he said.\nCalling it a privilege for the government to be associated with the Mahakumbh of the century, the Chief Minister highlighted how, despite all the negative propaganda, the nation and the world embraced the event, elevating it to unprecedented success.\nThe Chief Minister also acknowledged Assembly member Manoj Pandey's efforts to bring up the issue of misinformation.\nHe pointed out how deliberate attempts were made to spread rumors by falsely linking accidents in Cairo, Nepal, Jharkhand, and other places to Mahakumbh, and questioned the motives of those responsible for such misleading narratives.\nHe also took a jibe at the Leader of Opposition in the House and said: \"I do not mock your opposition because I understand your habit.\"\n\"It is widely believed that today's 'Samajwadis' betray the very system that sustains them,\" he further quipped.\nSource: IANS\nAbout Gopi\nGopi Adusumilli is a Programmer.

While celebrations are often part of the MLB, time, score, and occasion often matter.\nIn the case of Siri, the Rays were already down 5-0 when his HR lifted up the team record to 5-1. Despite that, the Rays failed to climb back up, going home with a 9-1 loss against the\nNY Yankees. Yanks team captain Aaron Judge was visibly upset about Siri taking his sweet time across the field, as captured by Yes Network.\nMonday marked Siri’s 14th HR of the season in the fifth inning. Other than taking his time on the run, he also mocked the Yankees fans by ‘chirping’ hand gestures, which further irked the crowd and the Yankees team.\nDuring the game, Michael Kay blasted Jose Siri, saying he should’ve done it if the team was winning. It was not an appropriate time to mock and celebrate his home run, as per him.\nYou’re losing! Celebrate when you’re winning. They’re acting like it’s Mardi Gras in that dugout. You’re losing the game!Michael Kay as per X.\nMichael Kay wasn't a fan of Jose Siri's home run celebration.— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing)\n\"You're losing…I mean, they're acting like it's Mardi Gras in that dugout. You're losing the game!\"\n[pic.twitter.com/qKkvkXnwQv] [July 22, 2024]\nYankees manager\nAaron Boone also did not see favorably to the action as he commented,\nIt’s a new world.

Judge seemed to stare down his opponent all the way throughout his run on the field without blinking even once. In contrast, Soto took the approach of taunting his opponent on the field.\nSoto recorded the slowest home run of the competition this year so far,\nas per Marca, to outdo Siri’s slow trot performance. Although he said it was due to the hot weather and he wanted to avoid injuries, the fans seemed to have taken it in another way.\nI don’t know what (Jose Siri) was doing, actually. I just don’t know. For me, I just – you know, hot weather. Tough day. I tried to save the hammies and make sure I go nice and easy.Juan Soto as per Sam of Marca.\n\"I don't know what he was doing. For me, hot weather, tough day, try to save the hammies\" – Juan Soto on his home run trot in possible response to Jose Siri— Yankees Videos (@snyyankees)\nSoto adds: \"From this side, we always come out, play hard, and respect our teammates and the other teams too.\"\n[pic.twitter.com/L8kIVD0sVO] [July 22, 2024]\nRusso too went off on ‘First Take’ adding, “This is mind-boggling!” questioning how he even thought of celebrating when “they’re losing 5-0 at the time for crying out loud!” On the other hand, many supported Jose Siri saying baseball is a game to have fun, seeing no problem with his celebration.\nIn case you missed:",

    "text": "VENEZIA - Si è tenuta oggi, 27 marzo, una riunione del tavolo regionale sulla situazione e sulla definizione delle prospettive per il Fondaco dei Tedeschi di Venezia. La data di chiusura del 30 aprile prevista per il negozio si avvicina.\n«L'incontro di oggi aveva primariamente l'obiettivo di comprendere lo stato di avanzamento delle attività di ricollocamento previste dall'accordo di gennaio per i circa 200 lavoratori dipendenti di DFS Italia. In anticipo rispetto alla chiusura del negozio, - spiega l'assessore regionale al Lavoro Valeria Mantovan - prevista per il 30 aprile e alle attività di disallestimento che termineranno il 31 maggio, sono state già avviate le interviste e l'assessment per agevolare il ricollocamento di una parte dei lavoratori nelle aziende del gruppo LVMH. Parallelamente, è stata avviata un'attività che, per il tramite degli enti bilaterali, potrà facilitare il reinserimento in altre aziende del terziario e turistiche. Infine, è partita la progettazione per avviare i percorsi di politica attiva del lavoro messi a disposizione della Regione per orientare, formare e ricollocare i lavoratori».",
