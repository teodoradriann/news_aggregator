    "title": "4 Simple Words Helped This Pro Mountain Biker Beat a 2-Year Mental Block",
    "text": "By Ariel Kazunas ,\n9 hours ago\nIn 2021, pro freerider Sam Soriano locked into a rut that took her two years to ride out of. The timing of her progression stall-out couldn’t have felt worse; up until that point, Soriano’s career had been on a fast-paced upward trajectory. She had just signed her first pro contract, with Canyon Bikes, and had earned an invitation to Redbull Formation, a women’s freeride event meant to incubate talent and offer exposure for up and coming riders in a non-competitive environment.\nSam Soriano on an upward trajectory. Photo by&colon Autotelic Media &verbar Peter Jamison\n“There was so much hype around me and I wanted to prove that I deserved to be there,” Soriano recalls. “I pushed it so hard, I think I just fried my nervous system by constantly putting myself in a fear mindset,” she recalls. Soriano says that after the event, she felt awful: she was scared, rather than inspired, unwilling to try new things because she didn’t want to be seen failing. “I got to a point where I couldn’t progress, where I was comparing myself to everybody else, and struggling to figure out how to move forward.”\nIronically, Soriano says that stepping back felt like the only way to do that. She stopped attending events, and tried to shut out what she was seeing on social media. Seeing others progressing while she felt so stuck only dug her into a deeper hole. “I kind of turtled in and didn't really talk to anybody about it because I was embarrassed,” Soriano admits.\nBut talking about it, it turns out, ended up being hugely helpful, Soriano says. One, because it de-stigmatized creating space for the emotions involved in mountain biking, and two, because it eventually led her to one very pivotal question: Why?\n“I had a really impactful conversation with a sports psychologist who asked what my why was as a rider.” Soriano recalls. “I’ve been riding bikes since I was two, I started racing BMX when I was four, and then went from BMX to cross country to enduro to downhill. And during each phase, my goal would change—I’d want to be an Olympian, a World Cup champion. And then I started constructing all these ideas in my head about what a free rider looks like… But I’d never been asked that—Why?—before.”\nSoriano says the conversation made her realize that her mental block was largely about losing sight of why she rode bikes in the first place. “I feel like it’s really cliché, but my why as a rider is that I want to inspire people and serve others,\" she reflects. Aligning those main motivators with the type of riding she was actually doing helped Soriano her re-center on the parts of her sport that truly made her happy.\nSam Soriano having fun and keeping her \"Why\" in sight. Photo by&colon Autotelic Media &verbar Peter Jamison\nShe decided to share more about her struggle to progress with a wider audience, as scary as that sounded in an industry that—at times—Soriano says feels unreceptive towards too much vulnerability.\n“Mountain biking is an extremely stoic sport,” she elaborates. “I grew up being super negative to myself. I had an older brother, and it was just how we bantered to harass each other severely whenever we would ride.” Soriano says she learned to talk to herself in the same manner: “I was so horrible to myself. I was mean.”\nSharing her story, therefore, felt like a way she could do something productive, something others might find useful. Along with asking herself “Why,” Soriano had also begun to question her inner dialogue, and had found herself drawn to the story of a tennis player who’d started saying “I can do it,” to herself. At first it was just in her head, then eventually out loud, whenever she played a match or went up for a big point.\n“During my progression rut, I kept saying ‘I’m not hitting that drop,’ ‘I can’t do that,’” Soriano shares. Even though she was still going through the motions of keeping up with her gym workouts and her riding time, no matter how hard she trained, she still couldn’t get herself to try new features. “So I started whispering ‘I can do it,’” Soriano says, wondering just how effective something so small and even a bit silly-sounding could actually be.\nShe quickly found out: after two years without any new big hits, Soriano laced a feature she’d been working towards for what felt like ages. “I think saying I could do it, after feeling like for so long that I couldn't, melted the ice away, and my brain was like, ‘You know what, you actually can. You got this.’ And that was that.”\nSoriano says she caught the whole thing—“I can do it” included—on camera, and debated putting the clip up online because she felt self-conscious. After all, no one else in the mountain biking world was sharing anything similar. “I was afraid of what people would think of me. I felt like the clip was too emotionally outgoing for the mountain biking community.”\nView the original article to see embedded media.\nBut because she was trying to stay more aligned with her “Why,” Soriano posted it to her social media anyways, hoping that it could at least help a few people to learn about the mantra that had helped her start climbing out of her rut.\n“I’m super thankful that I did,” Soriano says, because the response was immediate. The post went viral, with an overwhelmingly positive reception. “It touched people in and outside of mountain biking, and just really hit home on every aspect of my ‘Why.’”\nSo while Soriano says she’s still very much figuring out how to be herself on the bike and navigating what she wants next for herself and her career, she’s at least back to feeling capable of challenging herself, which, in her view, is a requisite for progression. “I wasn’t doing anything outside of my comfort zone,” she says of the worst parts of her rut. “I know it seems contradictory but when it feels challenging, that’s when you’re moving forward.”\nSam Soriano challenging herself to keep on moving forward. Photo by&colon Autotelic Media &verbar Peter Jamison\nSam has also started selling “I can do it” stickers, like the one she slapped on the top tube of her bike, for anyone similarly looking for an easy way to remind themselves of the power of positive self-talk and mental reframing. She’s also choosing to be more process-based with her goals these days. “Because then even if you don’t quite achieve what you thought you would, you still enjoyed the process, it was still fun, and it’s easier to then move past it.”\nTo check out what Soriano gets up to next, and to buy an “I can do it” sticker for yourself, you can find Sam Soriano on Instagram .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

City leaders tell us budget shortfalls made the move necessary despite last year's two-day event, which has been the expectation in recent years once it was decided that the events would be packed into one day. The work to make it successful began.\n\" A way of moving forward and still providing a wonderful event for the community made sense to cut down to one full day, depending on how budgets and sponsorships and everything go in the future, we might move it back up to two, \" said Brent Kubalek, Pasco Recreation Services Manager.\nAs for what to expect, the Pasco school district will be a big part of what you see from the Mariachi band to dancing, even boxing. A lot of the performances will feature students with the Grand Marshal this year, a tenth-grade student, Robert Gomez.\nThe tenth grader is the Boys and Girls Club Youth of the Year. The goal is to show off and celebrate Mexican culture in Pasco.\n\" Great source of pride for my students, to be able to embrace their Mexican roots. Most of them are Mexican, Spanish-speaking ones, and it's a wonderful way for them to connect with their families and their heritage,\" said Allen Madsen, the Marachi instructor at Chiawana High School.\nThe festival kicks off this Saturday at ten in the morning with the parade at Volunteer Park.
