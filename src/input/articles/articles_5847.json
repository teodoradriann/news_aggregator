La gente no grita o pega a sus hijos porque crea realmente que eso les ayude, sino porque sienten el impulso de hacerlo, y las consecuencias a medio o largo plazo les importan una mierda. (Y también cómo se puedan sentir sus hijos, obviamente.)\n[#2](c2#c-2) o los castigos de \"a tu habitación\" o \"al rincón\". Es simplemente porque no puedes lidiar con la situación y te liberas de es situación que no puedes controlar.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Puedes ejercer la autoridad y poner límites a tus hijos sin necesidad de faltarles al respeto ni usar castigos, amenazas, coacción o chantaje emocional.\n[#12](c12#c-12) hay niños y niños, los hay que atienden a razonamientos y losnhay que pasan de tu culo olímpicamente en determinados momentos del día. No es tan fácil.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Nadie dijo que fuera fácil, al contrario, es mucho más difícil. Hay momentos en los que es jodidamente difícil, hay momentos en los que los estrangularías, y hasta hay momentos en los que pierdes los papeles*, como cualquier persona normal. Pero eso no significa que no se merezcan el mismo respeto que cualquier adulto. Lo que muchas veces nos olvidamos es de que su cerebro funciona distinto al nuestro, y que además no saben cómo funciona el mundo, y es nuestra responsabilidad protegerlos, enseñarlos y guiarlos.\n(*: Y las veces que me ha pasado con mi hijo le pido perdón, como haría con cualquier otro.)\n[#16](c16#c-16) totalmente de acuerdo, pero bueno, es que me toca bastante la moral que se venda que todo es posible hablando y explicando las cosas y no, eso no funciona con todos los niños en todo momento.\n[#14](c14#c-14) tengo un sobrino con diagnóstico tdah, creeme que sé que no es fácil. Pero te aseguro que no sirve absolutamente de nada ejercer violencia, amenazar o castigar.\n[#18](c18#c-18) bueno ahí ya hablamos de niños que nunca van a ver el mundo igual que nosotros con lo que interactuar con ellos va a ser siempre de forma diferente.\n[#6](c6#c-6) Estás confundiendo un grito para evitar una situación de peligro, cosa que se haría con cualquiera, niño, adulto o perro, con gritarle a alguien para imponer miedo y autoridad. ¿O te parece igual de bien que te grite alguien por la calle para evitar que te atropellen que que te grite el subnormal de tu jefe?\nLos que están a favor del castigo físico en niños les propongo hacer lo mismo con adultos. Que te pillan infringiendo una norma vial con el coche, una buena bofetada. Que has hecho mal la declaración de la renta, hostia al canto.\nHay muchas maneras de educar, aplicar castigos físicos es la peor de todas y el último recurso de los incompetentes.\n[#3](c3#c-3) El castigo físico siempre va acompañado de insultos verbales, gestuales además de amenazas verbales y físicas.",

    "text": "Hallan a CFE irregularidades por 69 millones de pesos en monederos electrónicos\nDetectan sobrepagos en contratos de compra de tarjetas para que trabajadores adquieran ropa y zapatos\nLa Auditoría Superior de la Federación (ASF) concluyó que la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) suma 69 millones de pesos que no han sido aclarados por presuntas irregularidades en la compra de monederos electrónicos a proveedores como Liverpool.\nSe revisó el ejercicio de 461 millones de pesos distribuidos en 28 procedimientos que la CFE y Empresas Productivas Subsidiarias (EPS) ejecutaron en 2023 para adquirir y contratar 33 mil 834 monederos electrónicos.\nTE PUEDE INTERESAR: Encuentran anomalías por 51.9 mil millones de pesos en cuenta pública 2023\nEllo deriva del contrato colectivo con el que la CFE se compromete a entregar a sus trabajadores cuatro juegos de ropa y de zapatos. Se determinó en un convenio que el monto de cada uno de los monederos sería de 13 mil 752 pesos.\nLa ASF encontró sobrepagos en los contratos, pues en algunos casos no se contemplaron bonificaciones, y en otros casos se calculó incorrectamente el IVA.\nSegún la Auditoría, las anomalías por esta práctica sumaron más de 61 millones de pesos.\n“En 25 contratos se calculó incorrectamente el IVA sobre el valor nominal del total de los monederos o tarjetas electrónicas (...) Por lo anterior, 15 GDD, CFE SSB y 8 GRT pagaron IVA de más por 33,348.4, 23,444.3 y 4,251.8 miles de pesos, respectivamente”, indica el tercer Informe de Resultado de la Fiscalización Superior de la Cuenta Pública 2023.\nTambién se detectó que no se contó con políticas para garantizar que los monederos sólo se usaran para comprar ropa y controlar que aquellos que no fuera posible entregar, se regresan al proveedor para obtener un reembolso.\nPor otro lado, Empresas Productivas Subsidiarias pagaron cantidades diferenciadas, pues a pesar de adquirir monederos electrónicos a un mismo proveedor, hubo descuentos distintos.\nAnte las anomalías detectadas, la CFE acumuló un monto de 69 millones 212 mil pesos por aclarar, pues de un total de 71 millones de pesos en irregularidades, en la revisión se recuperaron menos de dos millones de pesos.",

    "text": "El pasado 5 de febrero, la influencer Valentina Gilabert fue víctima de un violento ataque por parte de la también influencer Marianne Gonzaga, quien la apuñaló al menos 14 veces en el cuello, tórax, manos y pecho. Los hechos ocurrieron en una residencia de Park Pedregal, en la alcaldía Álvaro Obregón.\nÚNETE A NUESTRO CANAL DE WHATSAPP. EL PODER DE LA INFORMACIÓN EN LA PALMA DE TU MANO\nSÍGUENOS EN EL SHOWCASE DE LA SILLA ROTA DE GOOGLE NEWS\nGonzaga viajó esa mañana desde Cancún, Quintana Roo, en busca del padre de su hija. Al encontrarlo con su nueva pareja, Valentina Gilabert, se desató una discusión, tras la cual Marianne apuñaló a Valentina, lo que la llevó a permanecer en terapia intensiva durante varios días.\nTras 14 días del brutal ataque, la influencer Valentina Gilabert fue dada de alta el pasado martes 18 de fabrero de un hospital privado ubicado en la zona sur de la Ciudad de México.\nSegún reportes de medios locales, Gilabert continuará su recuperación en casa, donde recibirá la atención necesaria para su completa rehabilitación después de haber sido sometida a nueve cirugías.\nEsta noticia se produce apenas unos días después de que, el 11 de febrero, la influencer despertara del coma inducido y ya no requiriera ventilación mecánica. La familia de Gilabert informó que su estado de salud había ido evolucionando de manera positiva.\n\"Valentina ya despertó del coma inducido en el que se encontraba y fue retirada\", escribió la familia de la modelo en el comunicado.\nAsimismo, a la modelo se le retiró \"la ventilación mecánica, logrando así la recuperación poco a poco la función de hablar y deglutir\".\n\"Agradecemos profundamente las muestras de cariño, apoyo y preocupación que hemos recibido en estos momentos, por respeto a su privacidad, pedimos comprensión y paciencia\", informó la familia.\nVinculan a proceso a Marianne Gonzaga\nMientras tanto, su agresora, Marianne Gonzaga, enfrentó una audiencia en los juzgados de ejecución de sanciones el martes 11 de febrero. En la audiencia, un juez especializado en justicia para adolescentes vinculó a proceso a Marianne Gonzaga, de 17 años, por el delito de lesiones calificadas en perjuicio de Valentina. La joven permanecerá en internamiento preventivo.\nEl juez concedió un plazo de dos meses para la investigación, durante los cuales la acusada será recluida en un centro de internamiento para menores, lo que significa que no será llevada a un penal o reclusorio en este periodo.\n“Fue un internamiento preventivo, la investigación complementaria es de 60 días a partir de este momento”, declaró el abogado de Valentina Gilabert a medios de comunicación.\nEl pasado viernes, 7 de febrero, la Fiscalía General de Justicia de la Ciudad de México (FGJCDMX) informó que Marianne Gonzaga, influencer menor de edad, fue imputada por el delito de lesiones calificadas, luego de presuntamente agredir con un arma punzocortante a la modelo Valentina Gilabert en la colonia Jardines de Coyoacán.\nEl Ministerio Público solicitó su vinculación a proceso, así como la medida cautelar de internamiento preventivo. La defensa de la adolescente pidió la duplicidad del término constitucional, solicitud que fue concedida bajo la misma medida cautelar.\nDe acuerdo con la FGJCDMX, en delitos de lesiones calificadas, la legislación permite el uso de prisión preventiva, dependiendo de las circunstancias del caso. Hasta ahora, la representación legal de la víctima ha respaldado la estrategia jurídica del Ministerio Público.\nEn el comunicado, la Fiscalía reiteró su compromiso de garantizar el acceso a la justicia y evitar la impunidad en casos de violencia, aplicando los mecanismos institucionales necesarios para proteger a las víctimas.\n\"Recibió más de diez puñaladas\", dice mamá de Valentina, víctima de Marianne Gonzaga\nValentina Gilabert, modelo y creadora de contenido, se encuentra en terapia intensiva, intubada y en coma inducido tras ser apuñalada por la influencer de 17 años Marianne Gonzaga. Su madre, Maureen Papon, recurrió a las redes sociales para informar sobre su estado de salud.\n“Lamentamos comunicarles que la vida de Valentina sigue en peligro, está en terapia intensiva, está intubada y en coma inducido. Todavía no se sabe qué pueda suceder con la vida de Valentina. Se está investigando el caso como homicidio”, informó a través de la cuenta de Instagram de su esposo, Ernesto Gilabert.\nPapon expresó su confianza en las autoridades y llamó a los gobiernos local y federal a “hacer justicia” en el caso de su hija. Además, confirmó que Marianne Gonzaga es investigada por homicidio.\n“Se está investigando el caso como homicidio. Ella recibió un ataque de más de diez puñaladas, confiamos plenamente en el apoyo de las autoridades, que este caso no quede impune, que se haga justicia. Solicitamos el apoyo de nuestra señora presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum, la jefa de gobierno Clara Brugada y la fiscal Bertha Alcalde, confiamos en ustedes en que se haga lo justo, esto no puede quedar impune. No pueden seguir pasando cosas de este tipo y que no suceda nada\".\nEn su mensaje, la madre de Valentina pidió evitar la difusión de noticias falsas y enfatizó que la familia Gilabert es la única fuente confiable de información. “No les puedo dar más información de momento sobre el caso para no entorpecer el proceso legal”, finalizó.\nMarianne Gonzaga podría enfrentar cargos por intento de feminicidio: especialista\nLa influencer Marianne Gonzaga podría ser acusada de feminicidio porque apuñaló a la novia de su expareja y el hecho cumple con tres de las siete características que tiene un caso de feminicidio, señaló la abogada penalista Leslie Jiménez.\nEstas tres características son: existía una relación de confianza previa entre Marianne y la víctima; amenazas y acoso vía mensajes de texto por parte de Marianne y la ubicación e intención de las puñaladas en el cuerpo de la víctima.\nDe acuerdo con la penalista, la familia de la víctima Valentine “N” explicó que las puñaladas que la influencer le asestó se centraron en los pechos y en “sacarle los implantes” con lesiones específicas y localizadas.\n“A mi parecer es un feminicidio en grado de tentativa… Las lesiones que le causó son específicos, infamantes, degradantes y casi mutilaciones” explicó Leslie para este medio.\nLa abogada que también trabaja en la organización Impunidad Cero explicó que este caso podría complicarse debido a que se presume que la atacante es una menor de edad y su manejo podría quedar bajo la responsabilidad del sistema de justicia penal para adolescentes.\n¿Qué pasó y porqué la influencer Marianne Gonzaga fue apresada?\nMarianne es una influencer que graba contenido estilo “mommy blogger” en el que comparte su día a día siendo mamá de una pequeña niña de seis meses llamada Emma, su principal base de seguidores está en Tik Tok.\nValentine “N”, de presuntamente 18 años, es la pareja actual del exnovio y también papá de la hija de Marianne; trabaja como modelo.\nLos sucesos ocurrieron el pasado miércoles en una residencia de Park Pedregal ubicado en la alcaldía Álvaro Obregón, ahí llegó Marianne “N” que viajó la misma mañana desde Cancún, Quintana Roo y buscaba al papá de su hija.\nSí lo encontró, pero en compañía de su nueva pareja Valentine “N”, los tres discutieron y Marianne “N” apuñaló por lo menos 17 veces el cuerpo de Valentine “N” concentrando los ataques en el cuello, tórax, manos y pechos.\nLa familia de Valentine “N” afirma que las heridas en su pecho fueron con el objetivo de sacar los implantes de pecho que ella tiene y por el momento está internada en un hospital.\nMarianne Gonzaga es detenida en la alcaldía Álvaro Obregón\nPolicías en su función de vigilancia en calles de la colonia San Jerónimo Aculco, fueron notificados por los monitoristas del C2 Poniente de una persona herida, al parecer por una riña, en un inmueble ubicado en el cruce del Anillo Periférico y la calle Cerrada Oaxaca, por lo que acudieron de inmediato.\nDe acuerdo con la tarjeta informativa, los policías se entrevistaron con una joven de 18 años de edad con visibles lesiones y manchas de sangre, por lo cual coordinaron los servicios de emergencia; paramédicos que acudieron al sitio la atendieron y diagnosticaron con heridas de objeto punzocortante en tórax y cuello por lo que fue trasladada a un hospital para su atención médica definitiva.\nEn el relato, otra adolescente que se encontraba en el sitio, señaló a la probable responsable quien dijo, tuvo una discusión con un joven y la lesionada, y posteriormente tomó un cuchillo y la agredió físicamente.\nLos oficiales detuvieron a la joven que dijo tener 17 años de edad y fue presentada ante el agente del Ministerio Público correspondiente, quien determinará su situación jurídica.\nLa Fiscalía General de Justicia de la Ciudad de México reveló que el lugar en el que ha ocurrido el ataque fue en Park Pedregal, un edifico de departamentos, en uno en el que presuntamente ella tenía acceso.

Na próxima segunda-feira (2), está marcada audiência no TRT-2.\nÉ + que streaming. É arte, cultura e história.\nNo último domingo (24), trabalhadores das unidades de Itaquera e Sorocaba decidiram entrar em greve. A decisão tomada em assembleia foi motivada, segundo o sindicato da categoria, pela postura intransigente da empresa e recusa em dialogar sobre a jornada de trabalho.\n“Diante da tentativa arbitrária da PepsiCo de implementar a jornada 6x1 e 6x2, propusemos a jornada de trabalho espanhola como alternativa [alternar entre uma semana de 48 horas e uma semana de 40 horas]. Porém, mesmo com nossas insistentes solicitações para um diálogo construtivo, a empresa se manteve inflexível”, divulgou o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Indústrias de Laticínios e Alimentação de São Paulo e Região (Stilasp).\nO sindicato considera a postura da empresa inaceitável, considerando que há atualmente uma [mobilização nacional](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/politica/noticia/2024-11/proposta-sobre-fim-da-jornada-6x1-movimenta-redes-sociais) pelo fim de jornadas de trabalho exaustivas. “Nossa luta é para que todos trabalhadores tenham qualidade de vida e saúde mental.” A entidade não tem estimativa de adesão dos funcionários à greve.\nO tema ganhou repercussão nacional em novembro em razão da [proposta de emenda](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/radioagencia-nacional/politica/audio/2024-11/proposta-de-por-fim-jornada-6x1-ja-pode-tramitar-na-camara) à Constituição Federal (PEC), de autoria da deputada federal Erika Hilton (PSol-SP), que propõe jornada de trabalho de, no máximo, 36 horas semanais e quatro dias de trabalho por semana no Brasil.\nSegundo o Stilasp, na próxima audiência no TRT-2, as partes deverão apresentar, no mínimo, duas novas propostas de jornada de trabalho.\nEmpresa\nA PepsiCo disse, em nota, que “cumpre rigorosamente as leis do país e, ainda que em discussão no Congresso, a jornada 6x1 está de acordo com a legislação brasileira em vigor.”\n“A PepsiCo permanece aberta ao diálogo com seus colaboradores e representantes sindicais em busca de soluções equilibradas para todas as partes, reafirmando o seu cuidado e compromisso com as pessoas com base em relações éticas e responsáveis que sempre orientam as suas decisões”, informou.\n[Fale com a gente](https://www.opovo.com.br/falecomagente)",

    "text": "L’assenza di Jannik Sinner al torneo olimpico di tennis a Parigi è stata un fulmine a ciel sereno, un colpo durissimo per Filippo Volandri. Una vera e propria mazzata per il capitano della Nazionale azzurra di Davis, che non si aspettava di dover rinunciare alle Olimpiadi proprio al suo giocatore migliore. Era tutto pronto per l’arrivo di Jannik, nessuno si aspettava che potesse annunciare il ritiro prima del torneo. Lo ha confidato Volandi nel corso della conferenza stampa parigina precedente al via ufficiale dei Giochi. [Il retroscena: \"Non ho parlato con Sinner, ma con Vagnozzi\"](#iol-toc-476237476b70e1da2d04cbd75a5271a9) [Volandri ammette: \"Dopo Wimbledon è capitato un intoppo\"](#iol-toc-85c5770777c631683a87a60ef931fb0e) [La certezza del capitano: \"Italia da medaglia anche senza Sinner\"](#iol-toc-7140f9540132640646601d4701569814) Il retroscena: “Non ho parlato con Sinner, ma con Vagnozzi” La notizia del forfait di Sinner a Volandri non l’ha comunicata Jannik ma il suo allenatore, Simone Vagnozzi: “Alle 7 del mattino di ieri ho ricevuto la chiamata di Vagnozzi che mi diceva che Sinner proprio non ce l’avrebbe fatta”, ha spiegato il tecnico dell’Italia di Davis. “Dispiace tanto, soprattutto per lu. Non abbiamo parlato, ma [ l’avvicinamento alle Olimpiadi era stato programmato correttamente](https://sport.virgilio.it/olimpiadi-sinner-replica-agli-haters-da-campione-stavolta-ha-ragione-bertolucci-872367). Senza il numero 1 al mondo, ovviamente gli equilibri sono cambiati. Come capo delegazione e team leader qui chiunque vorrebbe avere il numero 1 del mondo in squadra”. Volandri ammette: “Dopo Wimbledon è capitato un intoppo” Enorme la sorpresa e altrettanto grande il dispiacere confessato da coach Volandri per il ritiro di Sinner. “Per il ragazzo dispiace, perché aveva pianificato questa Olimpiade”, ha aggiunto il coach. “Se poteva essere gestita meglio dopo Wimbledon? Se capita l’intoppo cerchi di gestire l’intoppo e cerchi di fare il massimo. La stagione è lunga e sai che qualcosa puoi togliere, lui non voleva togliere l’Olimpiade. Dopo Wimbledon [avrebbe potuto giocare un torneo su terra](https://sport.virgilio.it/olimpiadi-sinner-forfait-e-reazioni-panatta-che-dispiacere-stoccata-di-pietrangeli-all-italia-del-tennis-872257), poi non lo ha potuto fare, ma aveva pianificato una settimana di allenamento su terra“. La certezza del capitano: “Italia da medaglia anche senza Sinner” E ora, quali sono le aspettative dell’Italia del tennis per l’Olimpiade? Per Volandri l’obiettivo medaglie rimane alla portata degli Azzurri: “Anche senza Jannik sarà comunque l’Olimpiade dell’Italia, siamo qui con una squadra forte per riportare una medaglia nel nostro Paese. Certo, chiunque vorrebbe avere in squadra il numero 1 al mondo, ma sono abituato a fare con quello che ho a disposizione. Sinner sposta gli equilibri, lui poi è un portatore sano di professionalità e cultura del lavoro. Perdiamo tutti [il numero 1 al mondo](https://sport.virgilio.it/sinner-nadal-alcaraz-olimpiadi-rischio-872449) ma ci sono altri giocatori, come Musetti, che ha fatto la semifinale di Wimbledon. I ragazzi sanno che qui non giocano per loro stessi ma c’è una bandiera sulle spalle, come in Davis”.",
