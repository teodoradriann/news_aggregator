    "title": "Almost 5 million blenders sold at Costco, Target and Walmart are recalled because blades are breaking off - CBS Minnesota",
    "text": "BlendJet Inc. is recalling about 4.8 million portable blenders sold at Costco, Target and Walmart after receiving reports of blades breaking off as well as the product overheating or catching fire, resulting in dozens of injuries.\nThe Benicia, California-based company has heard of 329 incidents in which BlendJet 2 Portable Blenders' blades broke off while in use, and an additional 17 reports of overheating or fires that have resulted in property damage claims of roughly $150,000, according to a notice posted Thursday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nBlendJet has also received 49 reports of minor burn injuries and one laceration injury.\n\"While none of the reported incidents resulted in serious injury or significant property damage, out of an abundance of caution, our company updated the base of the BlendJet 2 to feature thicker blades and an improved electrical configuration,\" BlendJet said in a news release . The updates were incorporated many months ago, it added.\nConsumer Reports offered a somewhat different take, noting that it began raising safety concerns to the CPSC and BlendJet about the recalled blenders in August. \"In one complaint involving an injury, a consumer reported that the blender started smoking while plugged in, and the complainant's son reportedly burned his finger when unplugging it,\" CR stated.\n\"BlendJet should get the word out about this recall as much as possible in the new year, and we urge the company to offer people a refund if they aren't comfortable getting a replacement,\" William Wallace, CR's associate director of safety policy, said on Thursday in an emailed statement.\nManufactured in China, the recalled product was sold at stores nationwide and online from October 2020 through November 2023 for between $50 and $75. Offered in a variety of colors and designs, the recalled blenders contain serial numbers where the first four digits range between 5201 to 5542. Consumers can also go here to identify the blenders.\nConsumers are urged to stop using the blenders and to contact BlendJet for a free base unit replacement, according to the CPSC notice. People who bought the recalled product will have to remove and cut up the base's rubber seal and email or upload a photo to the company's website .\nBlendJet 2 blenders with serial numbers that start with \"5543\" or higher are not being recalled as they already have updated components, BlendJet stated.\nBeyond the 4.8 million recalled blenders sold in the U.S., another roughly 117,000 were sold in Canada.\nMore from CBS News U.S. population expected to top 335 million by New Year's Day As base pay rises, some companies are fighting back with fees, layoffs Here are the states where the minimum wage will rise on January 1 How much house can I afford on a $50,000 salary?

    "text": "Blackburn blames Chinese bot election attack on a weak Biden administration By Cami Mondeaux Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print October 24, 2024 4:40 pm . Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print A GOP lawmaker targeted by Chinese-controlled social media accounts is blaming the Biden administration, claiming that the U.S. government has not been aggressive enough to prevent such foreign attacks.\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) accused the Biden administration of being “too friendly” with the Chinese government , leading to a disinformation campaign led by Chinese social media bots ahead of the November election against downballot Republicans. The senator’s comments come after she and a handful of other lawmakers known for making anti-Chinese statements were targeted online as they seek reelection.\n“It should not surprise anyone,” Blackburn told the Washington Examiner in an interview. “We’re the ones that have said China needs to be held to account and China needs to keep their end of the trade deals and China should be held responsible for taking our jobs and sending us a virus.”\nBlackburn said the attacks were China’s way of “getting even” with the lawmakers because of their efforts to thwart the Chinese government. However, the senator said the foreign country likely felt emboldened to do so because the Biden administration “has been more friendly to them.”\n“I have gotten frustrated with this administration because they will not require China to keep their end of the bargain on our trade deals,” Blackburn said. “This administration removes sanctions, and you’ve got this administration that’s just been lax on holding China to account with their activity with our allies, so I’m not surprised.”\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to the White House for comment.\nSocial media accounts specifically targeted Blackburn with claims that the Republican senator has accepted $700,000 in campaign donations from opioid manufacturers, according to a report by Microsoft published earlier this week. The bots have also sought to promote Tennessee state Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is challenging Blackburn for her seat next month.\nIt is not clear whether lawmakers will push for legislation to crack down on foreign interference as Congress is not scheduled to return to Washington until after the election. However, Blackburn told the Washington Examiner that “some of us have already talked a good bit” about efforts to address the online attacks when they reconvene.\n“You’ll continue to see these efforts,” Blackburn said. “There should be bipartisan agreement that we hold China to account. Their goal is to be globally dominant by the time we get to the midpoint of this century, and if we are not firm with them, they’re going to continue to push forward.”\nOther lawmakers targeted in the disinformation campaign include Reps. Michael McCaul (R-TX) and Barry Moore (R-AL) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).\nMcCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been a target of the Chinese government after he called the Communist Party of China “the greatest generational challenge we face today” in a report released in 2020. China later banned the congressman from visiting the country after he visited Taiwan in 2023.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n“I consider it a badge of honor when the CCP — a leading abuser of human rights, censor of free speech, and oppressor of its own people — takes issue with my work,” McCaul said in a statement. “I’ve made standing up to the CCP a central part of my career because I believe they pose a generational threat to the United States and our interests around the globe, and I won’t be intimidated by their scare tactics.”\nIt is not clear whether McCaul will push for any legislative action in the House related to the social media attacks. The Washington Examiner contacted a spokesperson for his office for any future plans.\nTags 2024 Elections China Congress Marsha Blackburn Social Media Related Content Immigration Trudeau announces immigration restrictions as electoral defeat looms Beltway Confidential Land and labor acknowledgments teach students to hate America Presidential Trump’s comments about ‘ethnic cleansing’ leave Armenians ‘cautiously optimistic’ Beltway Confidential Will Kamala Harris cause a Democratic Party Jan. 6 crisis if she loses?

    "title": "Amazon Introduces its first quantum processing unit, Ocelot and the Quest for Reliable Quantum Computing",
    "text": "The start of a period of new developments in quantum technology. Amazon’s online services branch, known as AWS, has publicly shown its first quantum processing unit, called Ocelot, representing a very important point in the continuing effort to create working quantum computers. While large technology companies, such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM, are all working together to improve quantum research, AWS is concentrating on solving a very important problem in this area: reducing mistakes that happen in quantum systems. This advancement shows a significant step towards building quantum computer systems that can handle errors.\nOcelot, a prototype of modest scale, is engineered to substantially diminish the expenses associated with error correction, potentially achieving a reduction of up to 90%. This advancement holds the promise of expediting the development of robust quantum computers capable of performing complex calculations with minimal errors. This innovation is a vital step in rendering quantum computing more dependable and commercially viable.\nThe ability of quantum computing to bring about major changes is vast. It could drastically alter many sectors, from creating new medicines and understanding substances to predicting weather patterns and creating economic simulations. Unlike traditional computers that use simple on/off signals to handle data, quantum systems employ quantum bits, or qubits, which can be in multiple states at the same time. This special trait allows quantum machines to tackle very hard problems that would take regular computers a very long time, possibly thousands or millions of years, to figure out.\nYet, a major obstacle preventing quantum computers from reaching their full capabilities is the difficulty of fixing errors. Quantum setups are extremely delicate to their surroundings, making them prone to mistakes caused by changes in temperature, shaking, and electrical or magnetic interference. If there aren’t good ways to correct these errors, quantum computers can’t be trusted to perform long and complicated calculations.\nOcelot’s Role in Advancing Error Correction Techniques AWS has meticulously designed Ocelot with a primary focus on addressing error correction from its inception, rather than treating it as an afterthought. According to Oskar Painter, AWS’s Head of Quantum Hardware:\n“We believe that if we’re going to make practical quantum computers, quantum error correction needs to come first. That’s what we’ve done with Ocelot. We didn’t take an existing architecture and then try to incorporate error correction afterwards. We selected our qubit and architecture with quantum error correction as the top requirement.”\nOcelot is a small-scale prototype comprising two integrated silicon microchips, each measuring approximately one square centimeter. The chip employs ‘cat qubits’, a specialized type of qubit inspired by Schrödinger’s renowned thought experiment, wherein a cat exists in a superposition of two states. Cat qubits are designed to inherently suppress certain error types, thereby simplifying and reducing the cost of quantum error correction.\nAWS estimates that Ocelot’s architecture can reduce the resources required for error correction by a factor of five to ten compared to conventional methodologies. If successfully scaled, this could potentially reduce the expense of quantum error correction by 90%, significantly enhancing the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing.\nA Comparative Analysis: Ocelot Versus Other Quantum Chips AWS is not the sole technology giant making significant advancements in quantum computing. In recent times, several competitors have unveiled major breakthroughs:\nGoogle introduced its Willow chip, a superconducting quantum processor designed to enhance error rates. IBM successfully developed a quantum processor with over 1,000 qubits, a major step towards large-scale quantum computing. Microsoft unveiled Majorana 1, a chip utilizing topological qubits, which has the potential to dramatically shorten the timeline for achieving practical quantum computing.\nOcelot distinguishes itself by prioritizing error correction as its primary feature, rather than merely focusing on augmenting the number of qubits. While IBM and Google concentrate on scaling up qubit counts, AWS’s approach emphasizes reducing the error rate per qubit, which may prove to be a more sustainable pathway towards practical quantum computing.\nFixing mistakes in quantum computing requires constant improvements in how good the quantum bits are and how they’re made. According to Fernando Brandao, who is in charge of applied science at Amazon’s online services:\n“Fixing errors in quantum systems depends on making the actual quantum bits better and better. We can’t just keep using the usual ways we make computer chips. We need to start using new materials that have fewer problems, and we must create stronger ways to build these chips.”\nThis underscores another challenge: scaling quantum chips while maintaining qubit stability. As AWS refines Ocelot, the company will need to explore and develop novel materials and manufacturing methodologies to enhance qubit coherence and minimize error rates even further.\nOcelot remains a prototype developed within a laboratory setting, but AWS harbors ambitious aspirations for its future. The company intends to refine and scale its technology while continuing to foster collaborations with academic institutions and industry leaders.\nPainter emphasized AWS’s dedication to iterative development, stating:\n“We believe we have several more stages of scaling to go through. It’s a very hard problem to tackle, and we will need to continue to invest in basic research while staying connected to, and learning from, important work being done in academia.”\nHe characterized the development process as a “flywheel of continuous improvement and scaling”, where insights gleaned from Ocelot will inform the design of future, more potent quantum chips.\nWith the introduction of Ocelot, Amazon Web Services has firmly established its presence as a major participant in the quantum computing arena. By emphasizing quantum error correction as a foundational principle, AWS seeks to overcome a significant obstacle to large-scale quantum computing.\nIf Ocelot’s approach proves successful, it could drastically reduce the cost and complexity of constructing fault-tolerant quantum computers, bringing the technology closer to real-world applications. While much work remains, Ocelot represents a substantial advancement in unlocking the true potential of quantum computing.\nAs AWS and other technology giants continue to push the boundaries of quantum technology, the world moves closer to a future where quantum computers can solve problems far beyond the capabilities of today’s classical machines.",

From January 6h to January 7th, residents of Houston, Fillmore, and Winona counties enjoyed complimentary admission to the center, offering a unique opportunity to connect with these fascinating creatures. Visitors had the chance to partake in educational programs as well as explore an array of engaging owl-related exhibits. \"We have live owls, and we have mounted specimens of every species that occurs in North America\", says Karla Bloem, executive director of the International Owl Center. \"We have kid's owl art from all over the world. We have skulls of different owls. We have wingspans that show how big they are when their wings are spread because they look a whole lot bigger when their wings are open than when they're sitting on a perch. And we have a gift shop chalk-full of all kinds of owl stuff.\" They will also be hosting a Wisconsin Neighbor Weekend on February 3rn and 4th. Residents from Trempealeau, La Crosse, and Vernon counties will also be granted free admission. For more information you can check out their [website](https://www.internationalowlcenter.org/).",

    "text": "Two members of the Canadian Olympic team were dismissed and “sent home immediately” on Wednesday after they were caught using a drone to “record the New Zealand women’s football [soccer] team during practice.”\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) said it was “shocked and disappointed” by the incident, which was a violation of Canada’s commitment to “fair play” during the Olympics.\nThe COC on Tuesday released a statement saying a “non-accredited member of the Canada Soccer support team” was detained by French police in the city of Saint-Etienne, located near Lyon. The staffer was accused of spying on the New Zealand women’s soccer team with a drone.\nOn Wednesday, COC said Joseph Lombardi, an “unaccredited analyst with Soccer Canada,” would be sent home along with assistant women’s soccer coach Jasmine Mander.\nAccording to Canada’s National Post , Lombardi is an experienced 43-year-old technical coach who has been working in the system since 2009. He was a staffer at the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and worked at six FIFA youth tournaments during the ten years before that.\nMander, 29, is the assistant coach Lombardi reported to and is close to head coach Bev Priestman. She was an assistant when Canada won the gold medal at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. She has been involved in coaching soccer since she was a teenager.\nThe Toronto-based Women’s Executive Network recognized Jasmine Mander as one of the “most powerful women” in Canadian sports in 2020.\nAnother twist to Mander’s sad downfall is that her brother Amar is a physiotherapist for the New Zealand women’s team. The entire family was excited for the brother and sister to face each other at the Olympics.\n“We’d never, ever pictured ourselves going to the Olympics, let alone lining up against each other for different soccer teams. Honestly, I can’t even put it in words, the feeling,” Amar said in an interview last month.\nCOC said it was fully cooperating with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the FIFA soccer association on the investigation. The committee added that all Canada Soccer staffers have been instructed to undergo mandatory ethics training.\nHead coach Bev Priestman apologized to both Canadian and New Zealand players. She said the actions of Lombardi and Mander do not “represent the values our team stands for.”\n“I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program. Accordingly, to emphasize our team’s commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld,” Priestman said.\n“I support the sanctions being imposed by the Canadian Olympic Committee, their apologies to New Zealand, and the decision of Head Coach Bev Priestman,” said Canadian Minister of Sport and Physical Activity Carla Qualtrough.\n“These decisive actions will help ensure that individuals are held accountable and preserve the integrity of the game and fair play for all athletes,” Qualtrough said.\nThe New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) lodged a complaint with the IOC after Lombardi’s arrest and asked the COC to conduct a “full review” of the incident. NZOC said its team members spotted the drone and reported it to the police.\nThe NZOC and New Zealand Football said they were “shocked and disappointed” by the incident.\nLondon / Europe National Security Sports Canada Drones France New Zealand Olympics scandal",

    "text": "Temporal La DANA regresa a Mallorca: alerta naranja de la AEMET y aviso del Govern a la ciudadanía Se esperan precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora en toda la isla Duna Márquez Mallorca se encuentra en alerta naranja durante este viernes 1 de noviembre por la [DANA](/tags/dana/) (sigla de depresión aislada en niveles altos) que ha dejado al menos 155 de fallecidos y decenas de desaparecidos en la provincia de Valencia. El pasado lunes, Manacor vivió los efectos de este fenómeno meteorológico con fuertes precipitaciones que dejaron 174 litros por metro cuadrado que provocaron inundaciones, carreteras cortadas e intervenciones de los Bomberos de Mallorca, una de ellas en la Rafa Nadal Academy. Para este viernes se espera que regrese la DANA. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología ha activado la alerta naranja en toda la isla por precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, llegando a acumularse 120 litros por metro cuadrado en algunas zonas de la isla en pocas horas. Las lluvias se mantendrán hasta el sábado 2 de noviembre, alargándose el aviso naranja hasta primera hora de la mañana. Con el avance de las horas la alerta desaparecerá, pero las precipitaciones se mantendrán a lo largo del día. El Govern pide \"máxima prudencia\" Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en [Mallorca](/tags/mallorca/) y Menorca. Para coordinar posibles actuaciones conjuntas, la Dirección General de Emergencias ha reunido esta mañana al Grupo de Soporte Técnico del Plan con representantes, entre otros, de los Bomberos del Consell de Mallorca, Bomberos de Palma, Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, Guardia Civil, AEMET, Carreteras del Consell de Mallorca, Ibanat, SAMU 061, Recursos Hídricos y RiscBal. Recomendaciones para la alerta naranja en Mallorca Así, ante la posibilidad de que se produzcan inundaciones como consecuencia de las intensas lluvias y dado que este viernes se celebra la festividad de Tost Sants, se han consensuado estas recomendaciones: - Planificar las visitas a los cementerios en función de las condiciones meteorológicas y extremar las precauciones, prestando especial atención a las personas más vulnerables. - En el hogar, asegurar puertas y ventanas y quedarse en las zonas altas de la casa. Se aconseja también retirar del exterior todo lo que pueda ser arrastrado por el agua y trasladar medicamentos, documentos y elementos de valor, así como comida y agua potable a los lugares altos de la casa. - Se recomienda evitar los sótanos o zonas bajas, como garajes, y desconectar el interruptor general de electricidad en el caso de que el agua ya haya entrado en la casa. - En el exterior, aconsejan alejarse de torrentes y zonas inundables y, en zona urbana, buscar refugio en un edificio. No se aconseja caminar por zonas con agua en movimiento, ya que, cuanto más rápido corre el agua, más peligro hay. - Hay que evitar los desplazamientos en coche y, si es necesario circular, se debe moderar la velocidad y aumentar la distancia de seguridad. Se tiene que hacer por autopistas, autovías y carreteras principales. En caso de baja visibilidad, se debe detener el vehículo y señalizar su posición. - No se debe entrar en zonas inundables, aunque parezca que hay poca agua, ya que, con poca altura de agua, los coches flotan y son arrastrados fácilmente. Si el coche comienza a flotar y es arrastrado, hay que salir del vehículo de forma inmediata y, si no se puede por la puerta, se debe hacer por la ventana. En estos casos es recomendable abandonar el vehículo y dirigirse a zonas más altas en caso de que el coche quede inmovilizado por el agua o que el nivel de agua ya llegue al eje. - Aconsejan también llevar el móvil cargado y suficiente combustible en el vehículo y no aparcar en puentes, aceras o desembocaduras. En caso de emergencia, hay que llamar al 112.
