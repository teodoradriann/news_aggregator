    "text": "Categoria:\nPrefeitura apresenta medidas a serem tomadas na cidade devido à previsão de chuvas fortesPublicado em 21/03/2024 - 21:11 | Atualizado em 21/03/2024 - 21:18\nInício/\n- Prefeitura apresenta medidas a serem tomadas na cidade devido à previsão de chuvas fortes\nO prefeito do Rio, Eduardo Paes, apresentou na noite desta quinta-feira (21/03) as medidas a serem adotadas e o efetivo que será utilizado pelo município em ações de resposta, em função da previsão de elevado acumulado de chuva para a cidade nos próximos dias. Ao todo, 9,3 mil servidores estarão envolvidos na operação, incluindo equipes dos seguintes órgãos: Comlurb, secretarias de Conservação e de Ordem Pública, Centro de Operações Rio, Rio Águas, Defesa Civil, Sistema Alerta Rio, Fundação Georio, Guarda Municipal e CET-Rio. Até o momento não foi decretado ponto facultativo no município. De acordo com o cenário meteorológico ao longo das próximas horas, novas medidas podem ser anunciadas.\nDe acordo com o Sistema Alerta Rio, entre o fim da noite desta quinta-feira e a tarde de sábado (23/03), a aproximação e a passagem de uma frente fria deixarão o tempo instável na capital. A possibilidade é de pancadas de chuva moderada a muito forte a partir do final da noite de quinta-feira, se estendendo até a madrugada desta sexta-feira (22/03), acompanhadas de raios e rajadas de vento moderado a forte (até 75,9 km/h). A chuva poderá passar de 40mm por hora e 200mm em 24 horas. A média em março, segundo a série histórica, é de 124,7mm.\nAs próximas horas, incluindo a madrugada, serão fundamentais para a tomada de decisões que deixem a população em segurança. Segundo o prefeito, a principal recomendação é que todos evitem deslocamentos desnecessários e fiquem em casa ou locais considerados seguros.\n– Vamos observar as próximas 48 horas, 72 horas. Mas vamos ficar atentos. A rua a gente limpa, bem material recupera depois, mas o importante é sair desse suposto momento de crise mais aguda, que possamos sair com vidas preservadas e que serviço público trabalhe de forma adequada – disse o prefeito Eduardo Paes.\nMeteorologista-chefe do Sistema Alerta Rio, Raquel Franco ressalta que o município faz o acompanhamento da chegada das chuvas em tempo real:\n– Temos uma previsão de longo prazo, estamos no COR 24 horas por dia fazendo o monitoramento, temos radares, fluviômetros, ferramentas de detecção de raios, tudo para acompanhar essa chuva em tempo real.\nDesde 2021, a Prefeitura soma um investimento de R$ 2,1 bilhões com as principais ações preventivas na cidade. Contenção de encostas, programas de infraestrutura e aquisição de novas tecnologias, além do aprimoramento e da efetividade da capacidade de resposta aos eventos formam a base do Plano Verão 2023-2024.\n– Se for confirmada a frente fria intensa na parte da tarde, não será um dia normal. Deslocamento é algo a ser evitado quando tem evento extremo como esse. Todas as decisões tomadas partem de previsões de quadros técnicos, formados por meteorologistas, que nos monitoram. Tem previsão de maré alta, vento forte, ressaca e chuva forte – disse Eduardo Paes.\nO prefeito também deu orientações a pessoas que vivem em áreas de encostas:\n– Áreas de risco são mais vulneráveis. Quanto mais tempo de chuva, maior o risco de deslizamento nessas áreas. Perdas materiais não justificam os riscos.\nChefe executivo do COR, Marcus Belchior recomendou que a população busque informações nos canais oficiais da Prefeitura para se manter informada sobre a situação na cidade:\n– A Prefeitura vem investindo em monitoramento de curto prazo, usa modelos nacionais para suas análises. É importante que a população se mantenha informada pelos canais oficiais, do Centro de Operações. Trabalhamos 24 horas por dia com dados oficiais e estamos dimensionando a operação.\nSobre a possibilidade de decretar ponto facultativo nesta sexta-feira, o prefeito disse que aguardará as informações da madrugada para tomar a decisão:\n– Se for decretado o ponto facultativo, se a situação chegar ao extremo, será para toda a cidade parar. Mas entendemos que essa decisão deverá ser tomada por volta das 4h, 5h da manhã, diante de informações mais sólidas. Isso impacta na economia, não quero que crianças não tenham aula se não houver real necessidade.\nAlerta Rio chuva frente fria",

    "title": "Greek students hit the streets for another round of protests against private universities",
    "text": "For the third consecutive week, Greek student and youth groups and other progressive sections hit the streets, denouncing the conservative New Democracy (ND) government’s bid to open private universities. On Thursday, January 25, massive protest rallies were held in more than 40 cities, including Athens. Tens of thousands of students from coordination committees, and members of the Students’ Struggle Front (MAS), Panspoudastiki KS, Communist Youth of Greece (KNE), parents’ associations, teachers’ unions, and university workers demanded that the government scrap the proposed bill. The protesting students also expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine who are reeling under the genocidal war waged by the Zionist state of Israel. The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and All Workers’ Militant Front (PAME) expressed solidarity and support for the protests. The Kyriakos Mitsotakis-led government has been trying to circumvent a constitutional clause that bars the formation of private universities. Opponents of the move have said the private universities will be unaffordable for those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. As part of the ongoing protests, students’ coordinating committees have occupied many schools and universities. On January 24, the Communist Youth of Greece (KNE) [stated](https://www.902.gr/eidisi/neolaia-paideia/353585/kataggellei-tin-prospatheia-tis-kyvernisis-na-spilosei-ton-dikaio) that the government’s proposal would lead to the downgrading of degrees and the abolition of the uniform path to admissions for all. Kyriakos Ioannidis, the head of the Education Department of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), [alleged](https://www.902.gr/eidisi/politiki/353120/i-empeiria-deihnei-oti-i-yparxi-idiotikon-ypovathmise-ta-dimosia-panepistimia) that “The coexistence of the public and private sectors in areas such as health or education proves that the private sector not only did not upgrade the public sector through competition, as the government hypocritically claims, but rather downgraded it or led it to operate in terms of cost-benefit rather than satisfying the needs of the people.” Earlier, the New Democracy (ND) government pushed through the establishment of the University Police and increased surveillance of academic spaces, triggering widespread [protests](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/01/23/greek-students-and-teachers-protest-militarization-of-campuses/). The move was widely perceived as an attempt to thwart radical mobilizations from campuses against the anti-people policies of the government.",

    "text": "It's that time of year when you sit at home, hot mug of tea in hand, warm under a blanket … because you're sick and want to feel better.\nCold and flu season is in full swing, but cases of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19 appear to be down across the province compared to last year.\nSign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News Edmonton, right at your fingertips In Canada, flu season tends to start in late fall and last through the winter, peaking between December and February.\n\"When it's really cool, people tend to be indoors more and when people are in a smaller, indoor confined space, it's easier to pass viruses among people,\" said Dr. Stephanie Liu, a family physician and the founder of Dr. Mom.\nThis is also a time of the year when people tend to get together, but if you're sick, you should avoid those gatherings.\n\"We know that (a) virus is spread by touching surfaces that are contaminated with respiratory droplets,\" Liu said.\n\"If you're feeling quite unwell, you're having a fever, a cough, it really is best to just stay at home and work from home, because all we need is one person to go out there and (they) can pretty much get an entire office sick.\"\nIn the whole of the 2023-24 flu season, 16,229 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, 5,046 laboratory-confirmed RSV cases and 23,922 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported by Alberta Health Services.\nBy Dec. 9, 2023, there were 5,827 confirmed cases of influenza, 1,056 confirmed RSV cases and 11,102 confirmed COVID-19 cases.\nBy Dec. 7 this year, there were 806 confirmed cases of influenza, 981 confirmed RSV cases and 7,609 confirmed COVID-19 cases.\nSo far, 18.5 per cent of the population has gotten a flu shot this year and 12.2 per cent got a COVID-19 shot.\nBy the end of the 2023-24 flu season, 25 per cent of Albertans had received a flu shot.\nWhat to do when you're sick When you do get sick, pharmacist Mauli Patel recommends avoiding people for up to three days, even when you're feeling better, if you can.\n\"If you still decide to go make sure you mask up. I know it doesn't look very pretty during holiday gatherings, but it is something to protect your near and dear ones,\" Patel said.\n\"Follow good hand hygiene, wash your hands more often and try to have a little bit of distance while you're talking, cover up your cough if you can.\"\nIf you're having shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, have a persistent fever that lasts for more than three to five days or cannot maintain your fluid intake, Liu recommends contacting your doctor.\nOnce you are sick, there's plenty of options for medicine at the pharmacy and it can be confusing what to use.\n\"There are so many formulations available over the counter, but pharmacists are there to help,\" Patel said. \"Ask the questions, tell them your symptoms, or even call in ahead and tell them your symptoms, and they can get something ready for you, ready to go for pickup.\"\nIf you want to prevent getting sick, there are some things you can do.\n\"The first thing I recommend is making sure you're getting enough sleep, there's study after study that shows that if you're not getting enough sleep, that can actually weaken your immune system and increase your risk of getting the common cold,\" Liu said.\n\"Other things that are important are to avoid touching your face, if you touch a surface that's contaminated with a virus, and then you touch your face, it can go into your mucosal membranes, and you can get sick as a result.\"\n\"Nourish your body with lots of fruits and veggies, studies show that if you have a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, it can reduce your risk of getting sick,\" she added. \"Another thing is to make sure you're taking vitamin D.\"\nThere are also studies that have shown honey can help reduce cough severity and frequency and chicken soup can help reduce symptoms of the common cold.\nFor those holiday buffets and potlucks, Liu suggests having hand sanitizer at the start of the food line, to help prevent someone from getting others sick.\nWith files from CTV News Edmonton's Miriam Valdes-Carletti",

    "title": "Watch Out: Why Collectibles like Pokémon Cards and NFTs Could Turn Into Another Beanie Baby Bust",
    "text": "Investing in collectibles looks like it could be fun and maybe even financially rewarding. You buy items you think are rare and will rise in popularity and value, keep them safe, and eventually sell for a fat profit. Right?\nNot quite. Every once in a while, someone makes a fortune from collectibles, whether it's a Honus Wagner baseball card stuffed in a cigarette pack ($7.25 million) or a non-fungible token (NFT) consisting of white circles on a black background ($91.8 million). Experiencing a surge in popularity, some Pokémon trading cards have sold for over $400,000. But those stories become news for a simple reason—they're extremely rare.\nIn reality, even making modest amounts of money on collectibles is a difficult game that takes time and at least a little bit of luck. And you could easily end up losing money.\nKey Takeaways For every success story, many, many more investors lose money on collectibles. Collectibles can be expensive to acquire, and turning a profit may take years or decades—if it ever happens at all. Many collectibles, especially the most valuable ones, are targeted by fraudsters, aren't always easy to buy and sell, and swing wildly in valuation. The Risks of Investing in Collectibles These alternative investments can be extremely risky and not all of the drawbacks are obvious. Here are some of the main pitfalls of investing in collectibles.\nBargains are getting harder to find . With so much information online, the days of finding valuable items selling for next to nothing at a garage sale or flea market are increasingly rare.\nCounterfeiting . With high-value items, forgeries are common, and even appraisers miss some. Upfront costs . Even if you buy inexpensive collectibles, you need to store them. Some collectibles will be ruined if not kept in a certain environment, while others may require periodic maintenance. With expensive collectibles, in addition to the initial cost, you may want insurance. No income . Unlike stocks, bonds, and real estate, collectibles don’t generate income. The only way to make money is by selling at a profit, which may take decades or may never happen at all. Unpredictable price swings . All investments can be volatile , but collectibles are particularly so. This market is heavily influenced by trends and speculation about supply and demand . What was worth a fortune last month or last year may be worth very little next year or 10 years from now. Lack of liquidity . Finding a buyer willing to pay the desired price can be tricky.\nExamples of Collectibles That Didn’t Hold Their Value Beanie Babies Beanie Babies, small stuffed animals, set off a frenzy in the late 1990s, with some of the rarest selling for thousands of dollars. Then the craze lifted, leaving some people holding onto tens of thousands of dollars worth of Beanie Babies whose price would only continue to fall in the future. Today, only the very rarest editions are worth serious money, and they still don't command the same prices they did in the '90s.\nAntique Furniture It wasn't too long ago that antique furniture—think Victorian or Georgian—was widely in demand and a solid investment. No longer. So-called \"brown furniture\" has plummeted in value this century, with many people struggling to give it away. With mid-century modern and contemporary pieces trending, brown antiques that once sold for $8,000 might fetch only $350 now.\nNFTs Two years after the hype over NFTs reached a peak, a 2023 report analyzed more than 73,000 NFT collections and found that 95% of them had become worthless. That meant an estimated 23 million people were \"holding onto worthless investments.\" Celebrity investors from Michael Jordan to Justin Bieber were caught in the downfall, suffering significant losses in the value of their digital collectibles.\nThe Bottom Line Collectibles can be fun, but they aren’t always good investments. Isolated cases of these items selling for a fortune fill people’s heads with ideas that you can make more money doing this than buying stocks and bonds. Sadly, that’s seldom the case. Collectibles can be expensive to acquire and store, don’t generate income, are targeted by fraudsters, often lack liquidity, and swing wildly in valuation. Contrary to what you might have heard, it’s not easy to make money this way.\nArticle Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

    "text": "Hasta las comunidades rurales de los municipios de Camarones, Dibulla y Manaure en La Guajira llegó la Capitanía de Puerto de Riohacha de la Dirección General Marítima (Dimar), en donde adelantó jornadas de matrículas a embarcaciones menores de pesca artesanal de las zonas. Estas acciones se realizan en cumplimiento de la normatividad que la Autoridad Marítima Colombiana promueve para proteger la vida humana en el mar, así como ejercer control y seguimiento de las embarcaciones menores, al tiempo que contribuyen a la protección del medio ambiente marino y la prevención de accidentes durante la navegación.

El capitán de Puerto de Riohacha, teniente de Fragata Carlos Ramírez, reiteró al gremio marítimo en especial al de pescadores artesanales, la importancia de matricular sus embarcaciones, cumpliendo con los requisitos legales y de seguridad establecidos.

La Autoridad Marítima Colombiana continuará trabajando con las autoridades locales para garantizar la seguridad de las embarcaciones menores y demás naves, implementando dispositivos de inspección, monitoreo y verificación que permitan prevenir emergencias y proteger la vida humana en los mares y ríos.",
