    "text": "Boise Library trustees reject request to deem Bible ‘harmful to minors,’ restrict access On Wednesday, the Boise Public Library’s Board of Trustees rejected [a request](https://www.boisepubliclibrary.org/media/izjffm4r/2024-7-11-form-bk-holy-bible.pdf) to designate a version of the Bible as adults-only material. Trustees considered the request under [Idaho House Bill 710](https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/h0710/) that took effect on July 1. The bill requires libraries to relocate any book deemed “harmful for minors” upon Board review to a restricted section only accessible by adults. Library Trustee President Nicole Trammel Pantera said the removal request was for a Bible version – the New Living Translation – that the library doesn’t own. It was filed under an apparently fake name that crudely referenced Idaho Gov. Brad Little. “This is not in our collection. We do not own a copy of this title. This requester is not a library card holder to the extent we could identify,” Pantera said, adding: “just given the name, it just doesn't make sense to me.” This was the first removal request officially considered under the House Bill by the Boise Public Library, Idaho’s largest library system, and now the first to be rejected. Pantera said the board will respond to new removal requests as they come in each month. “This won't necessarily be the process in the future, if something warrants like a letter or a fuller consideration,” Pantera said, referring to the board’s brief consideration and quick rejection of the request. “It's just with this particular one.”",

    "text": "[Liga Portuguesa](/edition_stats.php?id=175797)\nCom Ricardo Estrelado em estreia, o Pêro Pinheiro voltou às vitórias. A jogar em casa, recebeu e venceu pela margem mínima a equipa do Oliveira do Hospital (1-0).\nAo contrário do Pêro Pinheiro,\nque estava sem vencer desde a partida contra o Caldas em outubro, o FC Oliveira do Hospital vinha de uma vitória, precisamente contra o Caldas. Na zona inferior da tabela, ambas as equipas entraram em campo com o objetivo de conquistar os três pontos.\nA primeira parte foi bastante equilibrada, com um ligeiro ascendente dos visitantes. As únicas oportunidades de perigo pertenceram a Valter Zacarias, aos 27 minutos e Gabriel Chagas, aos 31', que testaram os reflexos de Francisco Enes. O guarda-redes do clube da casa disse presente nas duas situações.\nO equilíbrio manteve-se durante a segunda parte, contudo o ligeiro ascendente passou a ser do Pêro Pinheiro. Uma mão na bola na área do FC Oliveira do Hospital ofereceu a hipótese para os da casa quebrarem o nulo. O capitão Diogo Pires, chamado à conversão, não vacilou e assinou o único golo da partida.\nAté ao final, a única oportunidade de perigo registou-se já no tempo de compensação, quando Diogo Nascimento cabeceou para defesa apertada do guarda-redes do Pêro Pinheiro. Desta forma, a formação de Sintra, ainda em penúltimo, reduziu a distância para o conjunto do distrito de Coimbra, atual antepenúltimo classificado.\n1-0\nDiogo Pires 55' (g.p.)",

    "text": "Wh/atsApp: +12094323659$/ Telegram: t.me/dreyfussbillyoriginal Advantages of Wegovy (Semaglutide) Wegovy, a brand name for semaglutide, is a groundbreaking medication designed to help people manage their weight more effectively. Approved by the FDA for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or those with overweight conditions accompanied by at least one weight-related health issue (such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure), Wegovy offers multiple advantages for individuals struggling to lose weight. One of the most notable benefits is its effectiveness in promoting substantial weight loss. Clinical studies have shown that people using Wegovy in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity can lose a significant percentage of their body weight. On average, patients lost between 15% and 20% of their body weight over a 68-week period, which is a much higher percentage than what most individuals can achieve through diet and exercise alone. Wegovy works by mimicking the action of the hormone GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), which is involved in regulating blood sugar, appetite, and food intake. By activating GLP-1 receptors in the brain, Wegovy reduces hunger and increases feelings of fullness, which can make it easier to stick to a healthy eating plan. This suppression of appetite, combined with the medication’s ability to slow gastric emptying, helps individuals consume fewer calories without feeling deprived. Another key advantage is its positive impact on related health conditions. Besides weight loss, Wegovy has shown benefits in improving certain metabolic markers, such as lowering blood sugar levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in some patients. For people with obesity-related conditions like type 2 diabetes, this could be particularly important as managing weight is often a key component of managing the disease. Wegovy also provides a convenient and consistent approach to weight management. It is administered via a once-weekly injection, which is a relatively simple regimen compared to other weight loss medications that require daily doses or significant lifestyle changes. This ease of use, combined with its proven effectiveness, makes it an attractive option for individuals who have struggled with other methods of weight loss in the past. In summary, Wegovy offers a powerful solution for weight management, delivering significant and sustained weight loss, reducing hunger, and providing health benefits beyond just shedding pounds. However, it is essential for patients to use it in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle, including proper diet and exercise, to achieve the best long-term results.

    "text": "Sports Gonzaga basketball ‘It doesn’t accidentally happen.’ Mark Few’s Hall of Fame nomination puts Gonzaga coach in ‘rarefied air’ Dec. 26, 2024 Updated Thu., Dec. 26, 2024 at 4:25 p.m. Gonzaga Bulldogs coach Mark Few calls a play against the Indiana Hoosiers during the second half of a college basketball game on Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024, at Paradise Island, Bahamas. Gonzaga won the game 89-73. (Tyler Tjomsland / The Spokesman-Review) X Email Reddit SMS By Theo Lawson theol@spokesman.com (509) 459-5584 It’s a line of questioning Mike Roth got frequently during a 24-year tenure as Gonzaga’s athletic director. Probably more times than he can count.\nColleagues at other schools with similar profiles, hoping to replicate Gonzaga’s formula, would reach out for tips, pointers, pieces of advice, anything that could help get them on the right track.\n“My phone used to ring all the time, I’m sure (current AD) Chris (Standiford’s) still rings with people wanting to know, you know, ‘How are you doing it? How are we getting done? What’s the secret sauce?’ ” Roth said.\nThe recipe? Fairly simple.\nRecreating it? Not quite as straightforward.\n“Well, you know, hire Mark Few as your head coach,” Roth said. “He made me look a lot smarter than I am.”\nFew, now in his 26th year at Gonzaga, the recipient of multiple Naismith Coach of the Year honors and 14 West Coast Conference Coach of the Year selections, recently became a first-time nominee for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, joining a class of candidates that includes Carmelo Anthony, Sue Bird, Dwight Howard, Doc Rivers, Maya Moore and one other college coach, Billy Donovan, a two-time national champion at Florida.\nGonzaga submitted paperwork to nominate Few, who recently became eligible for the Hall of Fame, and the university worked with the Naismith Basketball Foundation during its run-up to playing UConn on Dec. 14 in the Naismith Hall of Fame Game at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n“In my mind, he’s already in the Hall of Fame,” said Standiford, who replaced Roth as Gonzaga’s AD in 2021 after spending 28 years at the school in other capacities, including assistant AD. “His accomplishments speak for themselves, it’s just a matter of time before they’re recognized.\n“For me, his contributions to the game are already well documented and chronicled and already acknowledged too, right, in many ways. So to me, I actually I didn’t expect it to get as much – I didn’t I didn’t expect to see it celebrated in the way that it was in terms of a nomination.”\nFew has Gonzaga ranked 14th nationally and on track to qualify for its 27th consecutive NCAA Tournament. The Zags will likely have an opportunity to reach the program’s 10th consecutive Sweet 16 in March, extending the longest such streak in the country.\n“Being nominated for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is something I never thought was in the realm of possibility, but I am incredibly humbled and honored,” Few said in a school release. “It’s just a great testament to be surrounded by unbelievable people my whole career. I thank all the great players that have allowed us the privilege to coach them. I’m grateful for our tremendously talented, hard-working coaches, and an administration that has worked so well with us.\n“Most importantly, I’d like to thank my family that has been supportive of everything throughout all these years. This honor would not be possible without all these great people, as it’s something we’ve accomplished together.”\nFinalists from the group of candidates will be announced on Feb. 14, in conjunction with NBA All-Star Weekend in San Francisco. The Hall of Fame Class of 2025 will then be revealed during a national television broadcast at the NCAA Final Four in San Antonio on April 5.\nFew can join a list of active men’s college coaches – many of them close friends of the Gonzaga coach – who’ve been inducted to the Hall of Fame, including Kansas’ Bill Self, Michigan State’s Tom Izzo, Arkansas’ John Calipari and Rick Pitino of St. John’s.\n“I think that his contributions to the game have been so profound,” Standiford said, “and what he’s been able to do, you know, not just for the game of basketball, but certainly for Gonzaga University through basketball, and just set him in a in a place that is very rarefied air.”\nAlong with his run of success in the NCAA Tournament, Few is also the nation’s active leader in career winning percentage (83.2) and boasts an all-time record of 726-146.\n“It’s epic. It’s epic, man,” senior guard Nolan Hickman said of Few’s nomination. “What he’s been preaching, he’s a good dude, man, and everything he preaches, it’s portrayed to everybody in the public and the accolades speak for itself. He’s been in it for a long time and all props to him.”\n“It’s only right,” senior forward Graham Ike added.\nRoth, who elevated Few to his current position in 1999 when predecessor Dan Monson accepted a job at Minnesota, said the accolades Gonzaga and its coach have collected since then would’ve been “mind blowing” 25 years ago.\n“It doesn’t just accidentally happen,” Roth said. “If it was easy, we would be seeing a lot of schools like Gonzaga doing it. They all want to.”",

Especially when it hit the top of the windshield, you could see the glass start to shatter everywhere,” said medic Lydia Torres.\nStreaming 24/7: Watch NBC 5 local news and weather for free wherever you are\nTorres and her partner were on a call when they were sent scrambling for cover from stones as large as the palm of their hands.\n“It looks like a paintball hit him in the back of his shoulder blades,” she said.\nGet DFW local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox.

    "text": "Most people who cook have a collection of cookbooks that have been handed down and kept for decades.\nWhen the holidays arrive they dig through those cookbooks looking for a special dish they’ve prepared before. Many people who cook also have at least one recipe app on their smartphone that finds recipes to try.\nThere are about as many cooking and recipe apps in the app stores than any other category. Why would someone want a recipe app that contains no recipes?\nRecipe Keeper is unlike other recipe apps in that it doesn’t help find recipes across the internet but allows users to create their cookbooks by saving recipes they find online.\nHere’s how it works: While browsing Pinterest you may see a recipe you’d like to try.\nRather than pinning it, you can share the recipe with the Recipe Keeper app. When you do, the entire recipe is placed in your cookbook.\nIf you run across a recipe on a website, just share it with the Recipe Keeper app. Soon, you’ll have a nice collection of recipes you’ve discovered and want to save.\nIf you have a family recipe that was written down on a notecard by your grandmother, you can save that too by taking a photo\nAfter you’ve used the app for a while you’ll have dozens or even hundreds of recipes you’ve either tried or want to try.\nLike other cooking apps, each recipe is shown with ingredients and instructions.\nIf a recipe is for 6 servings but you have 11 people coming to dinner, you can adjust the serving sizes and all of the ingredients, which takes the guesswork out of making sure a dish can serve everyone around the table.\nRecipe Keeper is an app for iPhone and Android devices. There are also web apps for Chrome and Windows browsers which make it easy to save recipes on a computer.\nThe free version is limited to saving a certain number of recipes but a premium version is just $13 with no monthly subscription.",
