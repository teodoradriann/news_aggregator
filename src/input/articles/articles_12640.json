    "title": "Jury hears from mother of baby allegedly attacked by Lucy Letby at Countess of Chester Hospital | ITV News Granada",
    "text": "The mother of a newborn girl allegedly attacked by convicted killer Lucy Letby said it was \"the hardest decision of my life\" to switch off her daughter's life support, a court has heard.Lucy Letby, 34, is accused of attempting to murder the infant by displacing her breathing tube when she was being treated at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit.The youngster, known as Child K, was born \"extremely premature\" at 2.12am on 17 February 2016, weighing just 1lb 80z (692g).Within two hours of her birth Letby, from Hereford , was said to have been “caught virtually red-handed” by a senior consultant paediatrician when he entered the room and saw the defendant standing over the cot “doing nothing” as Child K’s blood oxygen levels dipped and alarms were not sounding as they should have done, jurors heard.The case against Lucy Letby is being heard at Manchester Crown Court Credit: Anthony Devlin/PA The prosecution says Letby went on to interfere with Child K's breathing tube twice more on the same night shift in a bid to create the impression that the infant was dislodging her own tube.Child K died three days later although the prosecution does not allege Letby caused her death.In a witness statement read to the court, Child K’s mother said she was lying awake in the family accommodation area at Arrowe Park in the early hours of 20 February when she said had the “strangest feeling which I cannot begin to describe”.Her husband was also awake, she said, and they both went to see Child K.She said: “As we walked into the room I could see the monitors and sats (oxygen saturation) readings were low. I knew straight away things weren’t great.“The doctor confirmed the worst. I asked if it was just a waiting game now or if she was going to get better. \"We had a long conversation and she said what happens next was entirely our decision.“I remember saying to the doctor that she had been poked and prodded from the moment she was born. \"Her tiny little delicate body had swollen up so much we didn’t want her to be suffering any more.“We didn’t want to be informed that we’d lost our little girl by alarms on the machines going off. We didn’t want to prolong things any more.“We made the decision together to switch off the machines and let her go. It was by far the hardest decision of my life.“One of the staff showed us to a family room where it was peaceful and quiet. Our daughter was wrapped in a blanket and was wearing a little hat. \"Our daughter was in my husband’s arms when she took her last breath and silently passed away.”Child K’s mother wiped away tears as she sat in court with her husband, while Letby followed proceedings from the dock flanked by three security guards.Consultant Paediatrician Dr John Gibbs, who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital for 25 years, told the jury that the levels of oxygen in the blood would ideally be kept above 90% but with a collapse they would drop to 70% or less.Dr Gibbs added that a significant drop in saturations together with a heart rate which goes below 60 beats per minute would be a “worry”.Junior prosecutor Simon Driver asked: “What are the range of appropriate interventions for a nurse or a doctor at the side of an incubator when a baby suffers a collapse or is heading to a collapse?”Dr Gibbs replied: “It depends what help they were receiving at the time. If they are mechanically ventilated the initial first response is to turn the oxygen up on the ventilator.“If the baby is not improving then they need to call for help.”The jury of six men and six women has been told that Letby was convicted at a trial last year of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six other infants at the Countess of Chester between June 2015 and June 2016.Letby denies one count of attempted murder. A court order prohibits reporting of the identities of the surviving and dead children in the case.",

    "title": "Haddad entra em 2024 com sério risco de derrota após desfazer o que o Congresso fez - Estadão",
    "text": "O ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad , consolidou-se como um dos principais personagens e um dos grandes vitoriosos do primeiro ano do terceiro mandato do presidente Lula , mas 2023 vai chegando ao fim e 2024 projeta o acirramento do mal estar nada dissimulado entre os três Poderes, com Judiciário acusado de “furor legisferante”, Legislativo desafiando o Judiciário , Executivo ora desautorizando o Congresso, ora sendo desautorizado por ele. Haddad está no centro da batalha. Contrariando o mau agouro e as previsões pessimistas que marcaram o início do governo, a economia traz boas notícias no fim do ano: a inflação caiu, os juros foram atrás; os índices de emprego melhoraram significativamente; a expectativa de crescimento surpreendeu para cima, é um alívio. E as principais reformas foram aprovadas. A tributária é uma vitória histórica do País. Tudo isso foi possível pelas propostas viáveis e consistentes do Ministério da Fazenda e pela paciência e uma até então desconhecida habilidade política de Haddad, que soube sustentar as posições de sua equipe, atrair a simpatia de setores decisivos da sociedade e negociar com os presidentes da Câmara, do Senado e do Banco Central. “Last but not least”, soube driblar a má vontade do PT e de ministros petistas do Planalto, conquistando o apoio do árbitro maior, que é Lula. O último lance do governo no ano, protagonizado por Haddad, projeta um início turbulento de 2024, com ameaças contra a Medida Provisória anunciada por ele nesta quinta-feira, 28/12, para revogar a prorrogação da desoneração da folha de pagamento dos setores que mais empregam mão-de-obra e apresentando um plano alternativo com algum alívio para as empresas, sem atingir tanto a arrecadação. O Congresso fez, Haddad desfez. Em rápida conversa, Haddad me explicou a MP como “mais justiça tributária e recuperação das previsões de arrecadação” – que encolheram ao longo das votações da pauta econômica no Congresso. Ou seja, como algo “normal”. Mas os poucos parlamentares que, apesar das festas natalinas, se mantêm atentos ao que acontece em Brasília não veem bem assim. E já pegam em armas. A guerra será entre a lei aprovada e promulgada pelo Congresso contra a MP de Haddad, que entra em vigor automaticamente, mas cai se caducar ou se o Congresso votar contra. No meio do tiroteio, o empresariado vai entrar em 2024 na escuridão. O que vale, a lei ou a MP? O ministro despacha em São Paulo nesta sexta, 29/12, e depois tira folga até 12 de janeiro, que ninguém é de ferro. Se sai vencedor de 2023, ele corre o sério risco de entrar derrotado em 2024.",

    "title": "MotoGP, Valencia flood: the final challenge between Bagnaia and Martin is at risk. There is the Portimao hypothesis",
    "text": "The terrible flood that is bringing the Valencia area to its knees is destined to also affect the Valencian Community GP, which has long been the traditional closing of the world championship on the Ricardo Tormo circuit . However, the race on November 17th, which will follow next weekend’s in Sepang and which will decide the world championship challenge between <a href=\"https://www.archyworldys.com/motogp-test-day-3-bagnaia-flies-ahead-of-martin-bastianini-3rd-marquez-is-6th/\" title=\"MotoGP test day 3, <a href=\"https://www.archyworldys.com/motogp-test-day-3-bagnaia-flies-ahead-of-martin-bastianini-3rd-marquez-is-6th/\" title=\"MotoGP test day 3, Bagnaia flies ahead of Martin . Bastianini 3rd, Marquez is 6th”>Bagnaia flies ahead of Martin . Bastianini 3rd, Marquez is 6th”>Bagnaia and Martin, is inevitably at risk. The circuit, according to what its director Nicolas Collado reported to the Spanish media, is in order: “The structures of the Valencia circuit have not suffered any damage, the track is 100% in order. There were no injuries among the workers and everyone is well. I think this is the most important thing.”\nWinning is no longer enough for Bagnaia: for the World Cup he needs an ally\nby Massimo Calandri\nOctober 28, 2024\nHowever, the roads are in disaster: “The ownership is doing a damage calculation and is working in view of the last race. A project is being prepared to reconstruct an access road within a week, in order to allow the influx of the public and professionals”. In short, doubts remain, even if the possibility of the World Championship being awarded to Sepang must be ruled out. So there are two solutions left. Being able to restore the area surrounding the Ricardo Tormo circuit or – and it seems the most probable hypothesis – moving the last Grand Prix to another Spanish circuit located in an area not affected by the floods. For logistical reasons, the Portuguese one in Portimao would also seem suitable for replacement.\n#MotoGP #Valencia #flood #final #challenge #Bagnaia #Martin #risk #Portimao #hypothesis\n–",

    "text": "The cryptocurrency exchange BISSNEX has recently completed key market expansion actions and gained increased recognition from the U.S. federal government and financial systems. BISSNEX's acquisition of the U.S. MSB license signals the continuous strengthening of the platform's capabilities and the adjustment of its global market strategy.\nFollowing the challenging progress of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF proposals, the U.S. has shown rising friendliness towards the crypto industry, supporting cryptocurrency taxation as property. Although their overall attitude towards cryptocurrencies remains cautious, as the industry continues to evolve, governments worldwide are gradually implementing trading and regulatory standards for the crypto industry. The widespread circulation of mainstream cryptocurrencies has made BISSNEX particularly attentive to expanding into the U.S. market.\nThe International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) previously released the \"Consultation Report on Policy Recommendations for Crypto-Asset and Digital Asset Markets,\" indicating further progress in global crypto industry regulation standards. Soon after, BISSNEX obtained the Money Services Business (MSB) license from the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a milestone demonstrating BISSNEX's compliance with the highest industry standards in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) practices. The platform will expand its services with higher compliance standards and strict regulatory requirements.\nSince its establishment, BISSNEX has been committed to creating a safe and legal trading environment to ensure the best protection for users' interests and assets. The acquisition of the U.S. MSB license is a significant achievement in BISSNEX's compliance efforts, representing its leading position in trading compliance. The granting of this license requires exchanges to undergo rigorous due diligence to ensure compliance with the highest financial regulatory standards.\nIn the U.S. states of New York and California, cryptocurrencies are considered legal digital assets. Based on its global market strategy, BISSNEX has strategically established its headquarters in New York, a decision made after careful consideration of the global regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies. The U.S., particularly New York, is known for its stringent regulatory framework, providing a solid foundation for financial business expansion. BISSNEX recognizes the importance of working closely with regulatory authorities to create a safe and sustainable cryptocurrency trading environment.\nBISSNEX is positioned at the forefront of compliance in the crypto industry. As a global financial centre, New York offers abundant financial resources and professional talent, providing BISSNEX with ample development opportunities. BISSNEX has also announced plans to expand its compliance team, recruiting various talents specializing in cryptocurrency regulations. This team will work tirelessly to ensure BISSNEX's operations comply with all relevant local and international regulations, providing users with peace of mind during trading. In addition to advancing compliance work, BISSNEX actively collaborates with regulatory bodies and industry associations to stay abreast of the latest developments in the cryptocurrency field.\nAs the crypto industry continues to evolve, BISSNEX remains firmly committed to operating with the highest compliance and security standards. The acquisition of the MSB license is a clear practice of this commitment, demonstrating BISSNEX's determination to provide a safe and compliant trading environment for its users.\nDisclaimer: This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

    "text": "点击右上角微信好友\n朋友圈\n请使用浏览器分享功能进行分享\n“从种子到成衣”\n棉花纺织品碳足迹可定量解析\n光明日报北京3月12日电 记者杨舒从中国农业科学院棉花研究所获悉，该所王占彪研究员团队定量解析了童装、针织衫、工作服、T恤和作训服等棉质纺织品“从种子到成衣”全阶段的碳排放情况，即碳足迹，并提出对应的具体“减碳”策略，为我国棉花纺织服装产业的可持续发展提供了重要思路和线索，也为全球棉花纺织产业减排策略的制定提供了科学依据。相关研究成果近日发表在环境科学类国际期刊《资源、保护与回收》上。\n此前有研究显示，全球纺织品行业的生命周期碳排放量仅次于石油和天然气行业，甚至超过国际航空和海运的总碳排放量。我国是全球最大的棉花生产和加工国之一，棉花使用量占全球的32%，纺织品和服装出口额占全球市场的1/3以上。有数据显示，我国纺织服装行业每年可排放约2.3亿吨的二氧化碳。因此，在“双碳”战略推动下，纺织服装企业主动管理全价值链碳排放，已经成为行业趋势。\n碳足迹是用来衡量某产品在一定时间内直接或间接导致的二氧化碳排放量的指标。王占彪认为，“从种子到成衣”定量解析棉花纺织服装产业的碳足迹，对推动我国纺织产业绿色转型具有重要意义。为此，研究团队基于从棉花种植、轧花、纺纱、织物制造、染色到服装制作的全生命周期，获取了大规模的调研数据，结合生命周期评价法，对我国纺织产业链进行了全面的实证分析。结果显示：在整个棉花纺织品全生命周期中，棉花生产、纺纱和制造阶段是主要的碳排放源，分别占总碳排放量的22.54%、19.91%和44.70%。\n研究发现，通过清洁能源、优化工厂规模、使用有机棉和加强回收利用等4种情景替代方案，棉花纺织品全生命周期的碳足迹可以分别降低52.48%、30.43%、35.95%和62.40%。因此，研究建议通过减少能源消耗、推进工艺技术革新和加强纺织品回收等举措减少碳排放，推动服装产业向可持续发展转型。\n《光明日报》（2025年03月13日 08版）",

    "text": "An Arctic airmass bringing snow, ice and bitterly cold conditions is on the way to Ireland next week, potentially leading to school closures, as concerns are being raised about the elderly and the homeless. Temperatures are set to plunge to as low as -10C next week, prompting warnings for road users and farmers, while a leading homeless campaigner has said it could be a ‘life-or-death situation’ for those sleeping rough.\nRELATED: Six tips for a healthy pregnancy this winter\nIn its forecast for next week, Met Éireann warned of ‘treacherous conditions with some significant accumulations of lying snow, along with widespread severe frost and ice’.\nIt issued a yellow cold weather warning for last night, with -3C due in places after darkness fell. While snow is expected over the weekend, the coldest of the weather will come early next week, with temperatures set to plummet as low as -10C on Tuesday night, along with dense freezing fog.\nA meeting will take place between Met Éireann and Local Authority Severe Weather Assessment Teams on Friday to discuss the impact of the Arctic blast.\nCEO of older persons charity Alone, Seán Moynihan, told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘The cold weather snap is a public health issue for older people so they need to make smart choices… Even if you’re short on money, our message would be to prioritise heating, medication and food.\n‘If you’re worried about the potential of increased costs that’s an issue for another day.’\nAubrey McCarthy, co-founder of homeless and addiction charity Tiglin, warned: ‘People who can’t get accommodation, or are sleeping rough because they have other difficulties, will face dire conditions.\n‘They are extremely vulnerable and are at risk. We know we are giving out hot stews, socks, hats and scarves, but as temperatures plummet the people coming to us are not just fighting the cold, they are fighting for survival. This is a life-or-death situation.’\nGary Gannon, education spokesman for the Social Democrats, said that the country is consistently ‘unprepared for cold weather, despite temperatures plummeting every year’. He urged the Government to ‘act now’ to ensure ‘vital’ services such as schools can remain open in a safe manner.\n‘The Government needs to ensure that local authorities are adequately prepared and resourced for freezing temperatures,’ he said.\nSinn Féin’s education spokeswoman Sorca Clarke TD, said that special attention must be paid to access roads to schools in small towns, ‘as many will be untreated, and potentially dangerous’ in the days ahead.\nMs Clarke also called on the Department to make additional funding available for schools that do not have functioning heating systems.\nA Department of Education spokesperson said ‘there is a possibility that some schools will choose to close’, but those decisions were down to the management of individual schools, and would be based on child safety.\n‘Areas for consideration include maintenance of premises and utilities, salting and gritting and transport to and from school and having regard to local conditions,’ he said.\nMet Éireann said this weekend will be very cold, with ‘very disruptive and impactful’ weather likely in the days ahead, with the possibility of heavy rain, sleet and snow.\nThe snow is set to begin on Saturday night, away from the south and southwest. Sunday will bring further falls of rain, sleet and some further significant snowfall accumulations for a time.\nIt will gradually become drier from the west later in the day as the area of low pressure moves away eastwards.\nMembers of the public who are concerned about anyone sleeping rough can contact the Dublin Region Homeless Executive via its website, call 01 872 0185 or use its free app Dublin City Rough Sleeper Alerts.\nAlone can be contacted via its national support line on 0818222024.\nShare your thoughts on this story or any other over on our discussion boards .",
