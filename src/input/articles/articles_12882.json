    "title": "Morel mushrooms at center of food poisoning outbreak",
    "text": "A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy. The FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels. “The toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,” according to the FDA guidance. Even then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: “Properly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.” People are also reading… Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana’s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave’s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms. Aaron Parker, the owner of Dave’s Sushi, said morels are a “boutique item.” In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said. Many highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave’s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms. Parker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels. “They had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,” Parker said. According to the FDA’s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked — including “false” morels, which look like spongy edible morels — and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked. The North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported. Marian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine — a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer— which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, “but some people still have reactions even though it’s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.” Heather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it’s not as “clear-cut” in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave’s Sushi. Mushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare — the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels — but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died. Before the new guidelines were issued, the FDA’s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a “regulatory authority.” The FDA’s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it’s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave’s Sushi. States’ regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials’ regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert. The study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms — including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry — may suggest a need for better communication. The study recognized a “guidance document” as the “single most important step forward” given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms. Hallen-Adams said raw morels are known to be poisonous by “mushroom people,” but that’s not common knowledge among chefs. In the Dave’s Sushi case, Hallen-Adams said, it was obvious that safety information didn’t get to the people who needed it. “And this could be something that could be addressed by labeling,” she said. There hasn’t been much emphasis placed on making sure consumers know how to properly prepare the mushrooms, Hallen-Adams said, “and that’s something we need to start doing.”",

    "text": "Shares of JD.com ( JD 2.74% ) jumped as much as 5.2% early Thursday then settled to trade up 2.8% as of 3:45 p.m. ET after the Chinese e-commerce giant revealed it's planning sweeping raises for its front-line staff next year.\nIn a post to its official WeChat account this morning, JD.com said it will nearly double the fixed salaries for its procurement, sales, and other front-line staff beginning Jan. 1, 2024. JD.com also said its retail staff will receive 20%+ pay increases.\nA vote of confidence from JD.com The market appears to be taking this development as an encouraging vote of confidence in JD.com's growth trajectory. JD.com has struggled to drive top-line growth in recent quarters -- with revenue last quarter rising a modest 1.7% year over year -- amid fierce competition and macroeconomic uncertainty that has dampened consumer spending in China.\nAt the same time, however, JD.com shares surged earlier this month after the Chinese government initiated new stimulus measures designed to stimulate the country's economic growth and bolster its struggling property sector. If these significant pay raises are any indication, perhaps JD.com is already seeing some of the early positive impact of those stimulus measures.\nWhat's next for JD.com investors? JD.com should be slated to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results in early March. On the former, most analysts are modeling an accelerated 6.2% increase in quarterly revenue, which would mean a slight (0.2%) decline in revenue for all of 2023.\nMost analysts will be more focused, however, on any clarity JD.com management can give investors with regard to growth in the coming year. With consensus estimates on Wall Street calling for a return to top-line growth of 6.8% for 2024, any incremental optimism would be well received by shareholders looking for JD.com's growth headwinds to abate.",

    "text": "UMass lands $6.4M EPA grant to help steel industry shrink carbon footprint The University of Massachusetts campus in Amherst. STAFF PHOTO/DAN LITTLE\nKARA PETERMAN\n> By SCOTT MERZBACH\nStaff Writer Published: 07-18-2024 4:26 PM Amherst MA umass amherst CLIMATE CHANGE facebook AMHERST — More than 37% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions are produced by the billions of tons of concrete, asphalt, steel, glass and other construction materials used in buildings and other infrastructure projects, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates.\nFor steel manufacturers to better understand their carbon footprint and their environmental impacts, researchers at the University of Massachusetts are using a $6.37 million, five-year federal grant to create a generator tool that will make greenhouse gas data more transparent, trustworthy and accessible to the industry.\nKara Peterman, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at UMass, is the lead researcher, working with three graduate students, to develop the tool that could transform the industry.\n“We’re trying to recalibrate the industry,” Peterman said, explaining that five years of funding could propel the industry 50 years into the future.\nCurrently, the environmental impact of construction materials is described in a document called an environmental product declaration, or EPDs. These documents describe the whole life cycle of the product, including energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions and the ultimate carbon footprint.\nAt its core, the UMass work will help steel manufacturers both create EPDs in their own work and access the data contained in EPDs from other companies. That, in turn, should lead to more sustainable purchasing decisions by allowing buyers to compare products, Peterman said.\nEPDs are currently made by individual manufacturers, are expensive to make and generally rely on self-reporting of data supporting the EPD. The EPD generator tool created at UMass, in contrast, will provide access, transparency and standardization to the EPD process, allowing manufacturers of any size and of any steel product to generate such a document. Companies will be able to use the EPD generator tool for free.\n“The ultimate goal is more and better EPDs,” Peterman said. “There are thousands of steel makers in the United States and we want to expand access to data and software so that every single one of them can have an EPD.”\nArticle continues after...\nYesterday's Most Read Articles Elements Massage studio in Hadley abruptly closes after state order Prominent immigration law firm in Northampton to close, affecting 30-plus employees Charged UMass protesters marshal defense: Question crackdown, cite ‘bad-faith’ chancellor negotiations Area property deed transfers, July 18 Smart-growth district plans along commercial corridor in Hadley forge ahead Around the Hamptons: ‘Wild cows’ find way back to Easthampton home; local internet testing; Blueberry Supper in Westhampton Your Daily Puzzles Cross|Word\nFlipart\nTypeshift\nSpellTower\nReally Bad Chess\nShe said the UMass team’s focus will be on data collection, developing data standards, and researching the life cycle environmental impact of raw materials and energy inputs to the steelmaking process.\n“We aim to expand and improve the quality of primary and secondary data available for use in EPDs. We will also be supporting development of educational resources for students, steelmakers and structural engineers, with the goal of retraining the workforce in sustainable steel construction practices.”\nUMass is one of four recipients in New England getting more than $18 million in grants through the Biden administration using money from the Inflation Reduction Act, with a goal of both reporting and reducing climate pollution from the manufacturing of construction materials.\nWhile the United States already leads the world in the production of clean construction materials, the expectation is that this will help further reduce climate pollution by helping businesses measure the carbon emissions associated with extracting, transporting and manufacturing their products. It also supports President Biden’s Federal Buy Clean Initiative, creating demand for clean construction materials that are used in federal buildings, highways and infrastructure projects.\nAccording to the EPA, the investments in data and tools will make high-quality EPDs available for 14 material categories, including both new and salvaged or reused materials. These efforts will help standardize and expand the market for construction products with lower greenhouse gas emissions. They will make it easier for federal, state and local governments and other institutional buyers to ensure the construction projects they fund use more climate-friendly products and materials.\nEPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said in a statement that cleaner construction materials like concrete and steel are increasingly essential for the nation’s prosperity.\n“These historic investments will expand market access for a new generation of more climate-friendly construction materials, and further grow American jobs that are paving the way to the clean energy economy,” McCabe said.\nRegional Administrator David W. Cash said in a statement that supporting the development and use of cleaner construction materials improves quality of life and combats climate change. “These projects are paving the way for a more sustainable future, ensuring that our children and grandchildren can thrive in a cleaner and healthier New England,” Cash said.\nUMass is partnering with the American Iron and Steel Institute and the American Institute of Steel Construction in creating the EPD generator tool that can be used by a broader range of manufacturers and fabricators, particularly small businesses, and creating a public-facing EPD repository for stakeholders to access high-quality data.\n“The ultimate goal is more and better EPDs,” Peterman said. “There are thousands of steel makers in the United States and we want to expand access to data and software so that every single one of them can have an EPD.”\nAt the student level, she sees a reimagining of the current steel curriculum to focus on carbon emissions instead of pure cost or time savings.\nPeterman said UMass will also provide educational resources to students and design, construction and steel industry professionals. This project seeks to identify deconstruction processes for existing structures, required tests for recovered materials, and required modifications and fabrication data to increase the use of salvaged steel products.\n“We’re demonstrating that we have the access to reach every corner of the industry,” Peterman said. “We have a broad base of support and that will be the key to our success.”\nScott Merzbach can be reached at smerzbach@gazettenet.com.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nNo menciona la discriminación religiosa entre los motivos de la CIA para no ayudar al régimen franquista.\nEn la España de Franco los protestantes sufrían persecución religiosa y EE. UU. es un país mayoritariamente protestante y con una fuerte influencia religiosa en la política.\n\"El entonces presidente, Harry S. Truman, que era bautista, envió un emisario a España y certificó la situación. Truman instó al régimen a permitir la libertad religiosa, pero ante la negativa de los obispos y el silencio del Vaticano, España se autoexcluyó de las ayudas\"\n\"tener que esperar años para recibir una autorización para casarse por lo civil o para inscribir a un recién nacido con un nombre ajeno al santoral, como Lidia. Los protestantes tampoco eran enterrados junto a los demás: su sitio en el cementerio estaba junto a los abortos, los suicidas, los agnósticos y los judíos\"\n\"el servicio militar, que concluía con la jura de la bandera y una misa, en la que los soldados tenían que arrodillarse. \"No hacerlo porque atentaba contra su conciencia y convicciones podía suponer la apertura de un consejo de guerra, y estar meses e incluso años en prisión\"\nhttps://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2021/12/04/61a9ec63fc6c83454f8b45c4.html\nY sobre todo, que Franco le dio a EE. UU. las bases en suelo español, y todo lo demás a pesar de no recibir el Plan Marshall. Hubiera sido tirar el dinero pagar por lo que puedes tener gratis.\n[#8](c8#c-8) o eres un ignorante o un mentiroso...\nConstitución de la republica española\nArtículo 27.\nLa libertad de conciencia y el derecho de profesar y practicar libremente cualquier religión quedan garantizados en el territorio español, salvo el respeto debido a las exigencias de la moral pública.\nLos cementerios estarán sometidos exclusivamente a la jurisdicción civil. No podrá haber en ellos separación de recintos por motivos religiosos.\nTodas las confesiones podrán ejercer sus cultos privadamente. Las manifestaciones públicas del culto habrán de ser, en cada caso, autorizadas por el Gobierno.\nNadie podrá ser compelido a declarar oficialmente sus creencias religiosas.\nLa condición religiosa no constituirá circunstancia modificativa de la personalidad civil ni política salvo lo dispuesto en esta Constitución para el nombramiento de Presidente de la República y para ser Presidente del Consejo de Ministros.\n[#29](c29#c-29) Ese chiste lo he oído de Stalin.\nLo hacían en Polonia pero también Rusia: un día descubrí en la wiki una serie de revistas (panfletos) clandestinas con mucho humor pero no recuerdo ahora el nombre, sorry\n[#3](c3#c-3) Franco no era tonto, eso de dar las bases a cambio de nada no es cierto, garantizaba la continuidad del régimen.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Lo de las bases le sirvió para que el primer astronauta español fuera otro, unas décadas más tarde.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Cierto, a Truman no le gustaba el ultracatolicismo religioso de Franco por la parte que le tocaba (el protestantismo). En el libro \"La Sexta Flota en Barcelona\" de Xavier Theros, se toca el tema.\nY lo sigue siendo.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Ucrania recibe ayuda militar y da igual lo incompetentes que sean porque nos importan un carajo sus muertos y el resultado de la guerra. El objetivo es desgastar a Rusia.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Un comediante de television , venido a presidente que ha resistido la invacion del segundo 4to mas grande del planeta y segundo mas grande en armamento nuclear y una pais 3 veces mas grande en poblacion y 28 veces mas grande en tamaño.\nPues incompetente seguro que no es.\nAsi que ahí te equivocas.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Seguro que tu que no eres incompetente lo hubieras echo mejor\n[#18](c18#c-18) Si te crees que es el quien dirige....eres muy ingenuo. Si no te lo crees , eres un troll propagandista.\n[#18](c18#c-18) Para la incompetencia no cuenta que su sagaz política exterior les haya conducido a una guerra en la que su país ha quedado hecho unos zorros, ¿Verdad?\n[#46](c46#c-46) Claro , es que es su culpa , si es que lo visten como putas. Mejor poner el culo y que otro pais te invada y te robe territorio, los puertos y las tierras de cultivo.\n[#55](c55#c-55) Claro que si,pero no te das cuenta que en Meneame la culpa siempre es y sera de Ucrania y de los Estados juntitos. Rusia solo se defiende. Ucrania tiene que rendirse, desaparecer y ser desnazificada purgada su cultura y poblacional por rusos como dijo Hijo Putin hace unos días. Que es eso de querer ser Europeos como las demás repúblicas exsovieticas , entrar en la UE para tener un mejor futuro y en la OTAN para no tener miedo de que Rusia te invada.\nPD:\n[#1](c1#c-1) Mea hace gracia que digas que son unos incompetentes y unos corruptos como si Rusia no fuera uno de los países mas corrupto e incompetente del mundo. Ucrania de incompetente no tiene nada y lo están demostrando todos los días, en cuanto a la corrupción la tienen , como España en su momento pero al menos están luchando contra ella.\n[#18](c18#c-18) Ucrania al principio intento negociar con Rusia para paran la guerra y no solo entregarle Crimea y las repúblicas separatistas sin no todo lo conquistado, por que Rusia no paro?. 1º Putin no reconoce a Ucrania como interlocutor y mucho menos a Zelensky , para el es solo un payaso , solo hablaba con USA y en su defecto con Alemania. 2º En aquella época Putin quería quedarse con toda ucrania no solo con NovaRusilla pues creía que ganarían y 3º Aun no se sabia lo de Bucha tras ver la masacre a los Ucranianos le quedo claro que era vencer o morir. Por cierto, porque siempre es Ucrania quien debe rendirse y no Rusia?, por que son los Ucranianos los que siempre y cito tus palabras \"está provocando una auténtica carnicería contra su propia gente obligando a gente sin adiestramiento ni posibilidad de resistir a ir a posiciones del frente que son insostenibles e inútiles. \" cuando esta claro que no solo reciben entrenamiento y están bien equipados si no que su entrenamiento es muuuy superior al ruso y ellos si cuidan de los suyos, a diferencia de los rusos que no paran de mandar a su gente a lo loco de frente contra posiciones bien defendidas provocando matanzas, solo en Azdifka en el ultimo mes de ofensiva los Rusos tienen entorno a 13.000 KIA. Pero oye son los Ucronazis los que lanzan su gente a morir.\n[#18](c18#c-18) Si no fuese un incompetente y un miserable habría aceptado y firmado el tratado de paz propuesto en Abril de 2022 dónde se le garantizó la retirada y la recuperación de la totalidad del territorio salvo la península Crimea regalada a Ucrania por Nikita Jrushchov en el 54, con la única condición que se mantuviesen neutrales, y tras el viaje de Boris Johnson en 2022 se desdijo de lo pactado.\nIncompetente sí es, no sólo es incompetente sino que está provocando una auténtica carnicería contra su propia gente obligando a gente sin adiestramiento ni posibilidad de resistir a ir a posiciones del frente que son insostenibles e inútiles.\n[#28](c28#c-28) se está sacrificando a la población ucraniana por paranoias occidentales, y se está fracasando en el desgaste a Rusia por incompetencia occidental.\nEn Menéame encontrarás un buen número de gente que te explicará las maravillas del nuevo orden mundial, con China, Rusia, e Irán marcando el camino a seguir para el resto del mundo. Porque \"el enemigo de mi enemigo es mi amigo.\"\n[#47](c47#c-47) Claro, y los muertos rusos en cambio lo son por defender la Madre Rusia como dice el que ordenó la invasión de Ucrania. Ucrania puede pedir la paz, si así lo desea, pero solo podrá tener la libertad de hacerlo si tiene la posibilidad de defenderse. La ayuda para Ucrania no se está cuestionando en Ucrania sino precisamente fuera de ella, y son los pro Putin, sean de extrema izquierda o extrema derecha, quienes lo hacen.\nSi, vamos apañados con China, Rusia, e Irán marcando el camino. De Guatemala a Guatepeor.\n[#2](c2#c-2) \"sus muertos\" les interesan a ellos. Ni que los estuvieran llevando al frente comisario soviético mediante\n[#2](c2#c-2) ¿Desgastar a Rusia? Claro, porque antes de la guerra, Rusia era un país extremadamente influyente en toda la geopolítica mundial por su astronómica riqueza, una super potencia mundial que eclipsaba a USA, todos los días salían varias noticias sobre lo que hacía Rusia o no en la portada de Meneame, con miles de votos y cientos de comentarios sesudos, RT y Sputnik tenían más influencia que CNN, Disney, Fox juntos. El cine ruso opacaba totalmente a Marvel y DC, Star Wars, las series de TV rusas dejaban a Juego de Tronos como una mera curiosidad. ¿Y qué me dices de la tecnología informática rusa? Todos en el Duolingo aprendiendo ruso para sacarle provecho a esas tecnologías. Y es que en el día a día de cualquier ciudadano del mundo, la influencia del gran poder de Rusia era más ubicuo que los rayos del Sol en el día. Claro, era imperativo desgastarla.\nNota: Se nota que soy irónico ¿No?\n[#1](c1#c-1) Lo de la corrupción franquista suena a justificación añadida para un informe que ya tenía una sentencia clara. En Iberoamérica Estados Unidos ha apoyado y fomentado históricamente a gobiernos corruptos.\nEn cualquier caso parece difícil comparar la corrupción entre periodos de la Historia de España. ¿Fue más corrupta la dictadura franquista, el periodo parlamentario o la República? ¿Qué evidencias hay?\n[#4](c4#c-4) Con la diferencia que las repúblicas iberoamericanas apoyaron al bando aliado durante la guerra mientras que España había sido totalmente favorable al eje.\nUna política de autarquía y proteccionista es el caldo de cultivo ideal para todo tipo de corrupción. El estraperlo y el mercado negro que marcó la posguerra no existían en la república.\n[#4](c4#c-4) \"Diario16 ha tenido acceso a ese informe que es demoledor y que muestra que el franquismo, además de un régimen basado en la represión, la tortura y los asesinatos, era un verdadero nido de corrupción.\"\nEs bastante claro lo que ponen y no sólo hay hemeroteca de sobra del tema, sino que ellos mismos se regalaron una AMNISTÍA en el 77, sabedores de la existencia de sus crímenes de lesa humanidad y haber robado más de medio país.\nRespecto a las diferencias con la segunda república, podríamos hablar de más de medio millón de muertos, de millones de exiliados a la fuerza, de la destrucción del sistema educativo y posterior entrega a la iglesia, de la permisividad del latrocinio al estado por parte de la iglesia e inmiscuirse en áreas del estado con concordatos, volver a traer mediante las armas a los galfarros borbones para seguir robando por más generaciones a los españoles pese a todas las veces que les hemos echado, usar a población española de esclava para realizar trabajos forzados, colaborar con nazis alemanes y fascistas italianos para bombardear a población civil, destruir casi toda la industria automovilística del país (pasando del Hispano-Suiza al 600), pudrir el ejército y la judicatura a base de meter a traidores afines a este régimen corrupto para perpetuarse por la fuerza, quitar derechos a mujeres y trabajadores, romper y regalar partes de España a los americanos y marroquíes, obligar a la población a pasar por una hambruna de muchos años, romper millones de familias entre asesinatos y exilios, etc...\nY lo que queda en el tintero, que no tengo todo el día para escribir, como ese artículo que sacan los fachas para tratar de \"justificar\" todo lo anterior diciendo que \"Largo Caballero dijo\". El ¿y Paracuellos qué? Como si fuesen comparables las matanzas entre los traidores a España y los que defendieron con su vida al país y su democracia.\n[#57](c57#c-57) Ah, entonces me podría tirar 2 vidas poniendo enlaces a infinidad de fuentes, así que casi mejor te dejo la búsqueda de Google y ves por ti mismo lo ampliamente documentado que quedó todo ese oscuro episodio de los traidores a España y que gracias a la ley de AMNISTÍA del 77 además quedaron impunes y sin juzgar, no como el resto de crímenes y criminales que hemos tenido en España.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=Franco+corrupci%C3%B3n\n[#61](c61#c-61) Es que justo me puse con ello y parece que no hay tanta como en otros periodos de la historia de España. Se habla mucho de estraperlo. Ahora tenemos el tráfico de drogas que mueve mucho más dinero. No sé, me da la sensación que no podríamos decir que el periodo franquista fue más corrupto.\nOtro tema es ser antifranquista por temas políticos. Ahí sí que hay buenos argumentos.\n[#68](c68#c-68) Si nos vamos al narcotráfico resulta que siguen siendo los mismos\nM. Rajoy con la hija de Fraga haciendo campaña en el yate de un narco, Frijolito con una amistad de años con otro narco, Aznar indultando a los mayores narcos de Europa (según Interpol), etc... También con una amplia hemeroteca del tema. Y si hablamos de la mafia del juego y las apuestas, TAMBIÉN están metidos de lleno los del PP, herederos directos del franquismo.\nSer antifascista, antifranquista y antipepero es lo normal y lógico si no te gusta ver cómo una banda de traidores a España se llenan los bolsillos a la fuerza usando lágrimas ajenas de lubricante, como los violadores.\n[#68](c68#c-68)\nA ver, el franquismo no tenia corrupción, era corrupción. Todo se conseguia teniendo mano en nosedonde, conociendo a nosequien. Si te vas a basar en casos denunciados y juzgados también creerás que la gente estaba contenta porque había muchas menos manifestaciones\nAmnistiaron a los responsables de desastre de la dictadura,un ministro de franco se hizo cargo que de que las tradiciones corruptas se mantubieran, montando la estructura del PP ,el Rey se apunto al carro y los que iban a democratizar el pais ,liberarlo de la corrupción se enfangaron con el reparto de lo público y las tradicionales comisiones heredadas que tan bien conocia el funcionariado.\nResultado ideal de una transición ejemplar, que seguimos arrastrando cuatro decadas despues con un bipartidismo y sus medios, que siguen controlando para que nada cambie.\n[#13](c13#c-13) Si les dejamos pasta no sabremos a quién pedirle luego los intereses y la devolución de los favores.\nEmpezando por Juan Carlos primero and Cía la marabunta de políticos hijos del régimen y estamentos judiciales económicos , no es que se advierta un cambio desde que nos encasquetaron la democracia o demoslasgracias o dedocracia.\nPero no hay problema la plebe se compone de una amalgama de analfabetos profundos sin criterio,sin un mínimo de criterio ,basta ver el anuncio del PP para su futuro candidato gallego Rueda y el autobús en el caben todos menos el Puchi\n[#22](c22#c-22) yo ya voté sensacionalista. Estados Unidos no ayudó a España simplemente porque no le interesaba. Realmente la corrupción estaba instaurada en cualquier lugar, en algunos sitios más que en otros quizá pero no es como ahora.\nAportó alimentos a cambio de bases militares junto con residuos nucleares.\nEspaña, el país donde todo lo pasado por irrelevante que sea tiene que volver al debate que no interesa a nadie...\n- Se puede acusar a Franco de muchas cosas, pero una cosa es ideologia e idiosincracia y otra es incompetencia.\nSi hubera sido un incompetente no hubiera estado tanto tiempo en el poder, (Quiza porque hubieramos entrado en la WWWII) y no hubiera logrado el Plan Marshall, (convencer a EEUU que ellos no eran aliados de Hitler, que realmente lo que querian erradicar era el comunismo, por eso solo apoyaron en el Frente de Rusia con la division azul), ni que Espana comenzara a ser una potencia turistica. \"Con Fraga hasta la Braga\"\nPor otra parte las mayores atrocidades de la los nacionales ocurrieron durante la guerra civil, os imaginais que en vez de Franco hubiera sido el Caudillo Queipo llano, por poner un ejemplo.\n[#52](c52#c-52) Para mantenerse en el poder siendo un dictador (que es lo que era Franco, aunque algunos no quieran admitirlo, que son precisamente los que llaman dictador a Pedro Sanchez) no hace falta ser competente gobernando, solo ser competente poniendo a gente que sea leal al dictador (aunque solo sea temporalmente) y mantener a la cúpula y a los militares contentos, repartiendo el botín de la dictadura. ¿Franco era competente manteniendo el poder? sí. ¿Era competente en todo lo demás? no lo creo.\nEn tiempos de Franco alguien pregunta cómo están las cosas en España.\n- ¿Y por ahí como estáis?\n- No nos podemos quejar\n- Entonces, todo bien ¿no?\n- No, no: que no nos podemos quejar.\n[#31](c31#c-31) es como el nuevo orden mundial, el fin de las quejas.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Index\n[#78](c78#c-78)\nNo, eso fue cosecha propia. Después de 20 años de fracaso económico total, se convencieron de que se necesitaban dirigentes que no fueran simples militarotes franquistas o fanáticos afectos al régimen; se dieron cuenta de que se necesita también inteligencia.\nDigamos que se pasó de una ultraderecha Fuerza Nueva / V0x a una derecha cerril pero no suicida.\nComo se nota la influencia heredada del franquismo sociológico, todavía hay personas que intentan blanquearlo.\nUn estadounidense le dijo a un franquista que en España no había libertad, que en Estados Unidos cualquiera podía criticar a Truman sin que le pasara nada\n- ¡Aquí es igual!, contestó el franquista. Aquí podías criticar a Truman y no pasaba nada.\nLo que decian los amigos:\n\"...informe que es demoledor y que muestra que el franquismo, además de un régimen basado en la represión, la tortura y los asesinatos, era un verdadero nido de corrupción.\"\nEsto no es ninguna novedad, la España de los años 40 y principios de los 50 era un desastre. La explosión del crecimiento económico empezó en los 60 y duró hasta principios de los 2000. Su se ajusta a la inflación, el crecimiento del GDP per capita español ha durado unos 40-50 desde el año 60. Y se ha vuelto a estancar de nuevo en la última década y media.\nQue tiempos aquellos, hemos pasado de ser el culo a la boca de U S A..., y tambien hemos mejorado, ahora por los pelos ya no somos el laboratorio social del mundo libre...\nCambiar, han cambiado, afortunadamente, muchas cosas, pero esa, no. Ni la estupidez de la CIA ni la corrupción en España.",

    "text": "Local musician published for scientific breakthrough Martha Summa-Chadwick devleops program for people with disabilities CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (WDEF) — A local musical researcher developed a way for people with disabilities to learn how to play piano through the use of colored blocks. In her [ Notes2Blocks](https://www.mtgic.org/project2a.html) program, students of all ages and skill sets can learn how to connect through the universal language of music. Martha Summa-Chadwick grew up as a concert pianist and always felt there was something else to be discovered. Her recent study published in [Helen: The Journal of Human Exceptionality](https://helenjournal.org/december-2023/notes2blocks-making-learning-music-accessible-to-all), received praise for her collaborative work in a new form of therapy– which involves a keyboard with colored keys. It came about in 2019 when Summa-Chadwick did a program at the Chattanooga Public Library to do an inclusive program involving children with autism. “They wanted to be able to learn the same piece of music with their neurotypical peers sitting in the same place. They had just gotten keyboards donated from UTC. So that’s how this kind of all came about. I designed this system– hand-drew a lot of graphs out… it took a lot of time. And a friend of mine suggested you know, why don’t you just automate this and read in an XML file? And I thought… Of course, that’s a great idea,” Executive director of [ Music Therapy Gateway in Communications](https://www.mtgic.org/about.html) Summa-Chadwick said. Summa-Chadwick said a child she was working with years ago was challenged with autism and cerebral palsy. “You know, you’re talking about speech, motor and cognition processes that can be helped through music. The brain oscillations, the heart rate, the muscles, everything starts to move with the rhythm. And the therapy is incredible,” Summa-Chadwick said. Through this music therapy, the child was able to work through motor movements with his hands, despite his hand tremor. “He couldn’t read music, but he could read the colors. So that’s how we said, ‘Ah. We can do this with symbols and take away all this.’ The need for cognition to be able to learn to read the music, and just do it basically on response,” Summa-Chadwick said. The project has been up and running for about a year now, locally. And this is only just the beginning. “Things like this are possible because people get out of their silos. Usually doctors work with doctors, and therapists work with therapists, and musicians work with musicians. But to do something like this, we all have to sit around the same table and work together on it,” Summa-Chadwick said. The researcher also credited UTC for their successful music therapy program. “I worked with the folks at UTC to get their music therapy program up to speed several years ago, and beautifully, they just graduated their first class of music therapists– which I am just absolutely thrilled with. Music therapists are starting to get more and more prominence in the world at this point… I think it’s going to be really successful when the neuroscientists and the music therapists are really working together to find these kinds of solutions. So, you’ve got not only the research area but the clinical– dropping down into the clinical area as well.” She looks forward to spreading awareness of this scientific breakthrough to people of all ages and ability levels.

    "title": "Gordon L. Weil: Absolute power corrupts",
    "text": "“Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.”\nThese are the classic words of Lord John Acton, a 19th Century British historian.\nWe seem to have no shortage of eligible “great men” these days.\nHaving gained a taste of presidential power, Donald Trump proclaims his interest in more and greater power. He would free his criminally convicted allies, use the government to punish his foes and replace the nonpartisan civil service with his loyalists. Single-handedly, he would remove the U.S. from international leadership roles.\nCivics students could ask how he could accomplish that with the checks and balances of the Constitution. A complacent Congress and a compliant Supreme Court could help him. By using dubious state tactics to suppress the Democratic vote for Congress and in the electoral vote count for president, he could gain for himself wide freedom of action.\nFor his core backers, the fact this “great man” is a “bad” man makes no difference. Ultimately, his chances for another term could depend on whether traditional Republicans drop him if he is convicted of a major violation of law. Otherwise, with unlimited power, his unlimited ego could prove Lord Acton correct.\nEqually subject to Acton’s principle is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a Trump ally. He has just admitted to one of the most historic lies. As soon as Israel was created in 1948, the international community adopted the concept that Israel, the homeland of dispersed Jews, and Palestine, an Arab state, should exist side-by-side. Israel agreed. Now, he flatly rejects it.\nIt has become clear that Israel, under Netanyahu’s long leadership, has had no real commitment to the two-state model with a separate Arab state, even one that is disarmed. He has simply hoodwinked the U.S., Israel’s willing ally and financial backer, and others.\nIsrael is now strongly influenced by conservative, ultra-religious parties. They favor a purely Jewish state with Arabs denied independence and subjected to Israeli authority allowing it to control Arab land. The destruction of Gaza conforms to this policy.\nGaza is being demolished to punish the population for the heinous acts of Hamas on Oct. 7. Netanyahu resists American and European calls for humane treatment of the population.\nThis policy reveals the extent of his own power. Though he relies on his religious party backers, his policy denies what they profess to promote. The bible says that God asks only that the people of Israel “do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with their God.” Mercy is now missing.\nMaine Sen. George Mitchell, who tried to negotiate Middle East peace, once warned that their failure to agree could lead to both sides losing. The Palestinians would lose territory and Israel would lose friends. Netanyahu is making that forecast come true.\nThe last words of the biblical passage stating God’s expectations reveals that, for Israel’s failures, “you will bear the scorn of the nations.”\nIn Russia, President Vladimir Putin, Trump’s trusted friend, shows the excesses of absolute power. Russia was offered a close relationship with its former opponents, but he chose to continue to assert that his country remained a superpower under his leadership. Ultimately, he believed his own myth and invaded Ukraine, a nation he deemed inferior.\nHe believed Russia would win in a few days. When it failed, it showed the world that Putin’s superpower was gone. He had sacrificed the historic standing of Russia to serve his own sense of power.\nYet Putin continues to hold onto his absolute power. He can kill his opponents even if they are abroad. After he failed to kill Alexei Navalny, his most effective political opponent, he imprisoned him almost indefinitely. Even foreigners, like Evan Gershkovich, an American journalist, can be jailed endlessly without charges.\nActon’s observation seems to become more credible the longer a “great man” holds onto office. Netanyahu is in his third term as Israel’s Prime Minister. Putin will soon gain his third term as Russia’s President plus one term as Prime Minister. If he wins in November, Trump has hinted that he should get an unconstitutional third term because of the controversy surrounding the 2020 election.\nThere can be no doubt that Acton was right. Power may come from elections, but absolute power results from leaders abusing their office to promote their complete authority, allowing them to alter the system to reflect their interest, not the national interest.\nMore important than any issue in an election is the threat that it can lead to the exercise of unchecked power. Such an election can have more long-lasting effects than any policy. And it rarely can produce a popular and successful result.\nPower grows in a vacuum, one created by passive people. Lord Acton is only correct, if we let it happen.\nGordon L. Weil formerly wrote for the Washington Post and other newspapers, served on the U.S. Senate and EU staffs, headed Maine state agencies and was a Harpswell selectman.\nSuccess.

    "text": "YOUR BUSINESS AUTHORITY\nSpringfield, MO\nIn a tight labor market where businesses struggle to find and retain qualified talent, local architectural firm Buf Studio has discovered that intentional culture development has become a primary competitive advantage. Founded in 2020, Buf Studio has built its growth strategy around creating an environment where people genuinely want to work.\nFor Managing Principal Ryan Faust, culture isn’t something that happens accidentally.\nHis intentional approach addresses a fundamental challenge many growing companies face. “I think most people get into their careers and they naturally want to grow,” Faust notes. “In order to retain the best, the company’s got to provide that opportunity for them.”\nBrie Madden, Director of Business Development, sees the results firsthand. “Our principals do a really good job of instilling ownership. They create so many opportunities for you to learn and grow, that if you’re doing the same thing a year from now, that’s not because there wasn’t an opportunity.”\nThe firm’s approach centers on what Faust calls “mentorship over management.” Rather than traditional top-down control, Buf Studio empowers employees to drive projects while providing guidance from behind. “I tell people, look, obviously we have to manage our projects, but as a leader I’m going to mentor you,” Faust says.\nThis philosophy creates measurable business benefits. “Our 24-year-old designer feels ownership over their own project, Madden explains. They’re not just somebody in the background drafting something and they’re nameless and faceless.”\nThe impact extends directly to client relationships. “In the architecture field, we’re with our clients for so long. A normal project has about a two-year minimum,” Faust explains. “If you come into that project and you’re not positive, you’re not engaged, you’re not excited about the project, that’s a big problem because you’re not building a whole lot of trust with that client.”\nWhile many companies struggle with remote work demands and work-life balance expectations, Buf Studio takes a different approach. They’ve chosen to require in-office presence while creating an environment that makes people want to be there. “We’re expected to be in the office, but we offset that with a lot of really great team building experiences that make people want to be in the office rather than working on their couch at home,” Madden notes.\nOne example is their weekly “Moment of Analog” (MOA). “On Wednesdays at 3:00 PM we do a moment of analog,” Faust describes. “The idea is to disconnect from your computer for 15 or 20 minutes. We’ll huddle up and just do something fun for a second. Last week it was like if you had a baby buffalo, what would you name it?”\nThis approach challenges conventional wisdom about flexibility. “I think it’s very easy to conflate the idea of work-life balance or a lot of flexibility or remote work with excellence,” Faust observes. “My question back to them is, well, tell me how that helps you be great at what you’re going to do.”\nThe firm’s success depends heavily on thoughtful recruitment. “You’ve really hired culture,” Faust emphasizes. “You can say whatever you want. ‘We’re this kind of firm, or that,’ but you’re not that kind of firm if you don’t hire those kinds of people.” The hiring process includes multiple interviews and personality assessments, Faust explains. “We use that to kind of analyze them and understand who they are a little bit better as a person.”\nThe underlying goal, however, is not to recruit for uniformity of thought. “We like people that think differently, that push us to think differently,” Madden clarifies. “What we do look for though, is uniformity in work ethic, because you’re not coming to Buf not to work. Period.”\nFor business leaders in any industry, Buf Studio’s approach offers practical insights. Culture development requires intentional effort, clear values, and consistent reinforcement. As Madden puts it, “Ryan includes us every quarter. He updates us exactly on what he’s thinking and dreaming and planning. He takes us along for the ride and it builds investment from all of us.”\nIn a competitive talent market, the companies that will thrive are those that don’t just offer jobs, but those who create environments where people can build meaningful careers. For Buf Studio, that philosophy isn’t just changing the workplace. It’s driving their growth.\nThis content is paid advertising by Buf Studio.\nThe local Decorating Den Interiors franchise moved; 65 Prime+ by Mercy Primary Care debuted in Springfield; and north-side eatery La Roux Bistro launched.",

    "text": "Economía 29-12-2023 11:32 - En Santa Fe Las tormentas de esta semana dejaron 50.000 hectáreas \"muy afectadas\" Un informe de la Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario detalla que el granizo y los excesos de lluvia afectaron a las ciudades de Cañada Rosquín, Carlos Pellegrini, El Trébol, Irigoyen, Clason y Montes de Oca. Las tormentas que tuvieron lugar a principios de esta semana en la región núcleo provocaron \"severas consecuencias\" sobre 50.000 hectáreas agrícolas que quedaron \"muy afectadas\", según un informe de la Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario (BCR). \"Alrededor de 50.000 hectáreas agrícolas se vieron muy afectadas por granizo y excesos de lluvia, de las cuales se estima que se perderá la mitad de la producción\", indicó la Guía Estratégica para el Agro (GEA) de la entidad rosarina. Además, reportó \"graves daños en el centro este de Buenos Aires y estragos en el noroeste argentino (NOA)\". De acuerdo con el documento, la denominada \"tormenta de Navidad afirmó el carácter violento e impredecible que está teniendo el tiempo en el país\". Entre las localidades de la región núcleo más afectadas se encuentran Cañada Rosquín, Carlos Pellegrini, El Trébol, Irigoyen, Clason y Montes de Oca. Las lluvias que se esperan hasta fin de año muestran que la región núcleo tendría una pequeña tregua, auguró la entidad rosarina Se estima que alrededor de 50.000 hectáreas agrícolas en esta área sufrieron \"daños significativos\" debido a inundaciones, exceso de humedad y granizo, y se perderá la mitad de la producción, proyectó la entidad. \"Los ingenieros agrónomos señalaron que la recuperación en algunos de estos campos será difícil, ya que muchos lotes de soja ya estaban en etapa de floración\", sumó. En tanto, en el sur de la región pampeana, distritos como Saladillo, Adolfo Alsina, Lobería y Balcarce también experimentaron \"fuertes daños\" debido a las tormentas. \"A pesar de que las cosechas de trigo y cebada estaban teniendo buenos rendimientos, las tormentas recientes han ocasionado daños importantes en algunos casos\", indicó la GEA. Incluso el NOA, que había estado sufriendo por la falta de lluvias, \"fue golpeado por lluvias intensas que causaron estragos en provincias como Tucumán y Catamarca\", dijo. La BCR además contempló que \"a pesar de la reciente recuperación hídrica, las tormentas no se comportaron como se esperaba, desviándose de los modelos predictivos incluso horas antes de su formación\", tras lo cual advirtió que \"lo más preocupante es la violencia con la que estas tormentas golpearon, causando inundaciones y graves daños en su paso\". \"Nunca antes habían visto mangas de granizo tan amplias y con una cobertura de daño tan extensa como en esta ocasión\" Asimismo, subrayó que \"el granizo ha sido uno de los principales problemas en esta tormenta\" y los daños que este fenómeno causa \"afirman que nunca antes habían visto mangas de granizo tan amplias y con una cobertura de daño tan extensa como en esta ocasión\". \"La preocupación se centra en la intensidad de las tormentas porque, según los expertos, la violencia de las mismas no se debe únicamente a 'El Niño', sino a otras variables que afectan el comportamiento atmosférico, como las corrientes de aire frío y húmedo desde el sur y suroeste, así como la interacción con frentes fríos intensos\", se explayó la GEA en el informe. Las lluvias que se esperan hasta fin de año muestran que la región núcleo tendría una pequeña tregua, auguró la entidad rosarina. \"En esta oportunidad la acumulación de humedad atmosférica en la zona núcleo no va a ser tan significativa como en las últimas semanas. La presencia de lluvias generalizadas y de generoso volumen estaría limitada al extremo norte de Santa Fe, NOA y noreste argentino\", dijo el consultor de la BCR Alfredo Elorriaga. En este sentido, agregó que \"aun así, el pasaje del sistema frontal por la franja central puede dejar algunas lluvias en el sur de Córdoba, La Pampa y el sudoeste bonaerense, sectores que necesitan agua\".",
