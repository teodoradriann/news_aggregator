    "text": "SAN DIEGO (KGTV) — An elderly woman was rescued by three good Samaritans after her car plunged into the water following a traffic accident on Friday, police said. The incident occurred around 11:34 a.m. near the intersection of Mission Bay Drive and Bluffside Avenue. According to Sgt. Williams, the woman, in her 70s, was driving south on Mission Bay Drive when she collided with the car in front of her. The woman lost control of her vehicle, striking metal poles and crashing through a fence. Her white Honda then flipped in the air and landed upside down in the Rose Creek canal. Williams said three men, including Lyft driver Juan Castillo, witnessed the accident and immediately ran to the creek. They waded through heavy mud and three feet of water to reach the woman, who was unconscious inside the submerged car. \"I saw this white vehicle coming off the ramp real quick, and landed on the water.\" Castillo said. \"The way it landed - I knew somebody must be drowning, so I just ran and jumped in there.\" Castillo and the other rescuers managed to open the door, allowing water to rush in, and carefully removed the woman's seatbelt. They dragged her to the west side of the creek, where firefighters were able to assist in the rescue. The woman was then transported to a local hospital, police said. \"I hope somebody would do the same thing for any of my family members if they are in the same situation,\" Castillo said. He had been waiting for his car at an auto shop across the street when he saw the accident happen. Police said the driver of the other vehicle involved in the initial collision was not injured. The San Diego Fire-Rescue Department is investigating the incident and has not yet released further details.",

    "text": "In a world increasingly focused on sustainability and environmental stewardship, Tetra Pak, a titan in the food packaging industry, is steering a course toward enhancing the recycling capacity for carton packages within the European Union. This ambitious venture is not just a response to proposed regulations but a proactive stride into fostering a circular economy and promoting sustainable food systems. At the heart of this initiative is Markus Pfanner, Tetra Pak's Vice President of Sustainability Operations, who underscores the company's commitment to not just meeting but exceeding the environmental expectations of today and tomorrow.\nStrategic Investments in the European Union\nTetra Pak's roadmap for a greener future is paved with significant investments and partnerships across Sweden, Spain, and the Netherlands. These efforts are aimed at significantly bolstering the EU's capacity to recycle beverage cartons, a staple in global food packaging. By enhancing recycling technologies and infrastructures, Tetra Pak is not only adhering to the upcoming regulatory frameworks but is also setting a benchmark for the industry. These strategic investments are part of a broader vision that sees waste not as an endpoint but as a resource for new beginnings.\nChampioning Sustainability Beyond Borders\nBut Tetra Pak's vision extends far beyond the borders of the European Union. The company has embarked on a comprehensive program aimed at minimizing energy consumption, waste, and the use of water and chemicals in its equipment. This program is a testament to Tetra Pak's holistic approach to sustainability, addressing environmental concerns at every stage of the production process. Furthermore, Tetra Pak is tapping into the burgeoning demand for alternative proteins, supplying Chinese companies with the technology to produce food products that boast significantly smaller greenhouse gas footprints than traditional meat.\nInnovation at the Forefront\nAt the core of Tetra Pak's strategy is a relentless pursuit of automation and innovation, particularly in dairy manufacturing. The company envisions a future where dairy production is fully intelligent, leading to unprecedented efficiency gains and a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. With ambitious targets to help customers' facilities halve their greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation, and water usage by 2030, Tetra Pak is not just reimagining its own processes but is also empowering its clients to tread more lightly on the planet. The primary food processing equipment factory in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, stands as a beacon of this transformative journey, embodying Tetra Pak's commitment to a more sustainable and efficient future.\nAs the world grapples with the twin challenges of environmental sustainability and food security, companies like Tetra Pak are leading the charge toward solutions that promise not just survival but prosperity. Through strategic investments, innovative technologies, and a steadfast commitment to the circular economy, Tetra Pak is crafting a narrative of hope and resilience. The journey toward a more sustainable future is fraught with challenges, but with pioneers like Tetra Pak at the helm, the path forward is becoming clearer and more attainable.",

    "text": "Indiana Gov. Braun seeks to nix tax policies that disincentivize marriage\nThe governor of Indiana has signed an executive order designed to ensure that the state's tax policies do not disincentivize residents from getting married.\nIn a statement Monday, Indiana's Republican Gov. Mike Braun announced that he signed Executive Order 25-51: Removing Government-Imposed Tax Penalties on Marriage.\n\"Marriage is the fundamental cornerstone of strong families and strong communities, and we need to make sure Indiana's tax and benefits systems aren't penalizing Hoosiers for getting married,\" he wrote.\nBraun's office listed higher earnings for married people throughout their lifetime as one of the benefits of marriage. It also cited research findings that \"the top predictor of upward mobility for children was the number of intact families around them.\"\nThe governor identified marriage as \"the fundamental building block of families and society for millennia\" and part of a \"success sequence\" consisting of graduating from high school, obtaining full-time employment and waiting until at least the age of 21 before getting married and having children.\n\"Research initially conducted during the Clinton administration found only 2% of American adults who follow the 'success sequence' are in poverty and nearly 75% are in the middle class,\" the order stated. \"More recent research found that 97% of Millennials who follow the success sequence are not poor by the time they reach their prime young adult years (ages 28-34), but 53% of young adults who did not follow this sequence at all are in poverty.\"\nThe executive order also said The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 \"eliminated some of the disincentives to marriage in federal welfare programs, but disincentives persist due to how income of a cohabiting partner or spouse is factored into eligibility.\"\nBraun's office listed examples of what it says are Indiana's tax policies that fail to incentivize marriage, noting that single individuals can deduct up to $3,000 in rent expenses from their taxes while a married couple filing jointly has an identical exemption cap of $3,000.\nSimilarly, married and single people have the same maximum credit of $1,500 for their 529 contributions.\nThe executive order directed the Indiana Department of Revenue, as well as all other state agencies that administer either welfare or benefit programs, to \"estimate the amount of financial disincentive the current laws and policies place on marriage\" and \"recommend changes to the tax laws and policies that incentivize marriage and remove additional burdens being placed on those [who] are married.\"\nAgencies that deal with tax policies must provide a report by July 1 outlining recommended changes to remove marriage penalties, while agencies centered on benefit programs must do the same by July 1, 2026.\nThe executive order also expressed concern that \"disincentives continue to exist as welfare participation reduces the likelihood of marriage while the mother is receiving benefits.\"\n\"Signed in time for Tax Day, this executive order will make sure Indiana's policies are providing an incentive for Hoosiers to build strong families, rather than getting in the way,\" Braun wrote.\nRyan Foley is a reporter for The Christian Post.
