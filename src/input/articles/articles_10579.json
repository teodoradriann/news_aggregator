    "text": "Sweden has taken the giant leap of becoming the 32nd member of the club of nations bound together by their Article 5 commitment to defend each other - Copyright NTB/AFP Heiko Junge Max DELANY Swedish marines on Friday peered out from their assault vessel as part of a vast NATO military exercise to simulate repelling an invasion of neighbouring Norway.\nAfter a ceremony in Washington less than 24 hours earlier, the troops marked their country’s first full day as a member of the US-led alliance after two centuries of non-alignment.\nSweden’s push to join -– along with that of Finland –- was sparked two years ago by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOpposition from first Turkey and later Hungary held up Stockholm’s entry for months longer than other allies hoped.\n“I think it was definitely worth the wait,” combat boat commander Karl-Johan Ryden, 21, told AFP, as he watched over the frigid Arctic waters.\n“It’s been a long process,” weighed in Major Joakim Sjorgren. “But we always figured it’s going to be a yes, some way along the way. So we’ve been prepared for it.”\nThe Nordic Response exercise -– part of NATO’s biggest drills since the Cold War -– is far from the first time Swedish troops have trained with alliance members.\nSweden has for years been a close partner of NATO and worked with its Nordic neighbours on defence.\nBut now Stockholm has taken the giant leap of becoming the 32nd member of the club of nations bound together by their Article 5 commitment to defend each other.\n“I would say that for the tactical level, on the unit level, for soldiers and officers, this is not that big of a change because we have been training with NATO and having operations with NATO since the early 2000s,” Sweden’s commander for joint operations Carl-Johan Edstrom, one of the country’s top officers, told AFP.\n“But for Sweden in general it’s a big change. It’s the biggest change for 200 years –- it’s a mental shift.”\n– ‘New era’ –\nSenior Norwegian military commander Vice Admiral Rune Andersen said that Sweden’s membership -– on the back of Finland joining NATO last year –- opened up “a new era in how we do defence cooperation in the Nordic region”.\n“We’ve been working together for a long time, but the membership removes the rest of the hurdles,” he told AFP aboard a Norwegian coast guard ship.\nAndersen said Sweden could now be fully plugged into NATO’s secure lines and its territory and capabilities put to the alliance’s use.\n“But perhaps more importantly is that it’s only full membership of NATO that provides that mutual support within the Article 5 obligation on all sides,” he said.\nUS Vice Admiral Douglas Perry, who heads NATO’s Norfolk command that oversees the Atlantic and Arctic regions, said Sweden’s membership now meant it could be incorporated fully into the alliance’s new plans for a Russian attack.\n“They bring a lot to the table,” Perry said, pointing to Sweden’s strategic location between the Artic and the Baltic Seas.\nSweden joins NATO at a time when fears of a possible conflict between the alliance and Russia have risen as Moscow’s forces push back Ukraine two years into the war there.\nOnboard the Swedish marine vessel, new recruit Vera Nylander leaned on a machine gun as she thought about the chances that exercises might one day become real combat.\n“I’ll take it when and if it comes,” she said.\n“I think we are ready, we are prepared for it and we are trained for it if it happened.”",

    "text": "PAN-OS Firewalls from Palo Alto Networks have been hit by two zero-day vulnerabilities. They are now being actively abused by hackers. Palo Alto advises administrators not to give their management interfaces for these firewalls access to the internal corporate network.\n[Palo Alto Networks indicates](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2024-0012-cve-2024-9474/#post-137539-_50343o6a6han) that hackers are currently exploiting two zero-day vulnerabilities. These apply to its PAN-OS-based firewalls.\nFirst, this involves [CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012) that causes an authentication bypass. More specifically, the problem occurs in the PAN-OS management Web interface. Hackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain admin privileges.\nThe second known zero-day vulnerability, [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474), causes privilege escalation within firewalls, allowing hackers with root privileges to execute commands on the attacked firewall.\nPalo Alto Networks is now investigating the vulnerabilities and is warning customers that both vulnerabilities are already being exploited at this time. The vulnerabilities would attack a “limited” number of Web interfaces and by now hackers would install malware. Possibly a so-called “chain exploit” is already available. A single patch will therefore not guarantee any safety. The monitoring of one’s environments for persistent threats is needed.\n2,700 potentially vulnerable firewalls\nThe hackers reportedly have been active since Nov. 18 from IP addresses known for proxy/tunnel traffic from anonymous VPN services. Unit 42 of Palo Alto Networks assumes that a functional exploit for both vulnerabilities is now publicly available, so more malicious actions can be expected.\nCustomers can update to the latest versions of PAN-OS for a fix. In addition, the security specialist urges administrators to restrict access to internal corporate networks for their PAN-OS Web interfaces.\nShadowServer is now monitoring 2,700 PAN-OS firewalls susceptible to these vulnerabilities.\nPrevious vulnerabilities\nThe PAN-OS firewall vulnerabilities now disclosed are not the first that Palo Alto Networks has had to deal with this year. Early this month, a warning was issued about the [CVE-2024-5910](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-5910) authentication vulnerability for the Palo Alto Networks Expedition firewall configuration migration tool.\nIn July this year, a flaw was patched that could be exploited to reset admin login credentials for online PAN Expedition servers.\nIn April 2024, another patch was released for the critical and actively exploited vulnerability [CVE-2024-3400](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-3400) for PAN-OS firewalls. This vulnerability affected more than 82,000 firewalls.\nAlso read: [Palo Alto Networks: defending against machines, with machines](https://www.techzine.eu/blogs/security/42458/palo-alto-networks-defending-against-machines-with-machines/)",

    "text": "Take a peek at the future of the BMW M3 BMW rolls out a test vehicle that’s packed with tech. Wheels pull on a few of the threads. 1 Mar 2025, 09:00 am Gallery 16 A new BMW M3 remains a genuine event. While most of us are media-saturated these days to the extent that we barely looked up when the latest version of the 911 GT3 was announced, BMW is planning the biggest change to the M3 formula to date, and it’s something that certainly got our attention.\nThe big news that you probably knew already is that because it’ll be built on the Neue Klasse chassis , it’s a pure battery-electric vehicle. Yet BMW, as has been their strategy to date, is hedging and has vowed to follow it up with a twin-turbo six-cylinder petrol version.\nBMW recently displayed the Vision Driving Experience, a prototype that acts as a mobile test bed for much of the tech that will end up in the Neue Klasse, which is due next year.\n16 A new electronic suite has been developed for the Vision Driving Experience that BMW calls Heart of Joy that promises to deliver 10 times the processing power of current distributed ECUs. This takes integration of the drivetrain, steering, braking and energy recuperation to a level not yet seen in production EVs.\nSo powerful is the energy recuperation that BMW claimed in a media release that it “allows energy to be used more sustainably... 98 percent of drivers do not need to make any inputs using conventional brakes”. The company touts a 25 percent gain in energy efficiency as a result, which could well enable the next-gen M3 to utilise a smaller, lighter battery.\n“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” Frank Weber, a BMW board member, said in a statement.\n16 “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”\nIt’s not likely to be shy of torque. BMW has been testing the Vision Driving Experience at its M Performance Driving Centre in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where it has a track and factory, and claims a peak torque figure of a brain-bending 18,000Nm.\n“If the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude,” BMW says, “it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.”\n16 BMW has already shown what the next M3 should look like. It takes the Neue Klasse body and pumps it up with wider fenders, more aggressive front and rear bumpers, and much bigger brake discs. Speaking to the UK’s Autocar , BMW M CEO Frank van Meel confirmed that the ICE version is very much integral to the company’s plans.\n“We’re also working on the newest emission regulations on combustion engines. We’re planning to keep up our combustion cars as well,” he said. Asked if the gasoline and electric M3s will feature different badges, van Meel said, “Do we need to set them apart? An M3 is a promise, not an engine.”\n16 A test car that BMW calls Nadine has been undergoing cold weather testing in Arjeplog, Sweden, and video from that test appears to show a Hyundai-style synthetic engine sound and possibly a paddle-shift fake gearchange too.\nThe sound overlays the mechanical bass tones of an ICE with the keening of an EV motor. It’s not actually that far off a supercharger whine, and the driver is seen reaching for a paddle before the video ends. It seems likely that this car is to be built around a version of the Heart of Joy electronic architecture as seen on the Vision Driving Experience.\nOne thing’s for sure. BMW is hugely bullish about what this car can do. That can only be good news for Aussie car enthusiasts whose patience may well be richly rewarded.",
