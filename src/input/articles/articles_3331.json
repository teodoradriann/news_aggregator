    "text": "China successfully launched another batch of 18 Qianfan Constellation satellites from Hainan, South China, on Wednesday. The launch used the Long March-8 rocket, developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT).\nThis marked the first mission from Launch Pad 1 at the Hainan Commercial Space Launch Site, also built by CALT. The satellites were placed into orbit as planned, making the mission a complete success, according to the Global Times .\nCALT, a part of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, called the event a key milestone. The launch highlighted advancements in China’s commercial space industry and supported the country’s satellite network goals. This was the fifth flight for the Long March-8 series, showing steady progress in China’s space sector.\nBoth launch pads at the Hainan site are now operational, making it China’s first commercial launch site with diverse capabilities. Launch Pad 1 was built in just 18 months, setting a record for construction speed. Its advanced technology and efficient management are expected to drive further growth in China’s space programs.\nThis mission was the Long March-8 rocket’s first use of its dedicated launch pad. Previously, all Long March-8 flights launched from the Wenchang Space Launch Site. The new pad passed all tests, ensuring it is ready for frequent future launches, CALT noted.\nXiao Yun, chief commander of the Long March-8 series, stated that the dedicated pad will improve service for commercial clients by speeding up launch timelines. Multiple launches are planned this year, focusing on satellite constellations.\nSong Zhengyu, chief designer of the Long March-8 series, explained that the rocket is highly efficient for medium-lift missions. Its versatile design is well-suited for deploying large satellite networks in low-Earth orbit, around 1,100 km above Earth.\nCALT plans to follow a “7+7 test-launch cycle,” aiming to complete two launches in 14 days. With improved processes, they hope to cut launch costs by over 30%, supporting satellite internet and deep space missions.\nThe Qianfan Constellation now includes 90 satellites in orbit. Designed with advanced technology, the network delivers reliable, low-latency broadband internet services worldwide, according to SHGS, the satellite developer.\nThis launch marked the 563rd flight of the Long March rocket family.\nRelated News: China to Boost Economic Growth Through Consumption and Innovation",

    "title": "Getting Rich AF on Meme Coins - by Arbitrage Andy",
    "text": "If you had any remaining doubt about the utility of meme coins let me just step in here and say the utility is fat stacks of cash.\nJust this week I have made 5 ETH on APU, PEPE, and PACMOON.\nBut let’s set the scene for this madness, as many are still skeptical of the entire phenomena.\nBack in the day — say in the 60’s or 70’s or 80’s most people were well positioned to take on reasonable jobs and in reward, be able to afford a high quality of life in the United States.\nThe Boomers are the classic targets — drawing resentment from a large contingent of Millennial and Gen Zers who are struggling to achieve the same level of economic prosperity as their parents and grandparents.\nBoomers and others had the opportunity to take a job, invest into equity markets, buy homes, and accumulate assets that were exposed to the largest economic boom in history. Boomers are by far the richest generation.\nEven Gen X caught some great times economically. Back then the dollar was worth so much more.\nAs long as you invested in good companies or bought a decent home and just waited — you gained exposure to the largest economic booms on the face of the planet.\nNot to say older folks didn’t work hard — but everything was less saturated and chaotic.\nThere are people making $100 to $150K in major cities that may as well be poor.\nSubscribe The most robust and enduring periods of economic growth in the US occurred during three distinct time frames: from early 1961 to mid-1969, with a growth rate of 53% (5.1% annually); from mid-1991 to late 2000, with a growth rate of 43% (3.8% annually); and from late 1982 to mid-1990, with a growth rate of 37% (4% annually).\nOwning a home wasn’t some distant goal — it was relatively easy to do if you had a decent job. Home prices were lower, and there was less competition.\nBoomers and other generations have billions upon billions of assets in real estate, equities, bonds, metals, and businesses.\nFast forward to today — in the unclear post Covid 19 landscape of Fed money printing, a surging national debt number, high consumer costs, entrenched inflation, and a looming US Election. CPI increased 3.5% year over year last month marked by sticky supercore items. Not too long ago average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates went from around 2.8% in winter of 2021 up to a 21-year high of 7.7% in October of 2023.\nInflation is entrenched and the Fed’s dream of a quick pivot after Covid is all but shot now. Hell another hike could be on the way.\nThe big sigh of relief folks want in markets and monetary policy just isn’t coming soon enough.\nSociety is getting more and more degenerate — people are gambling on meme coins of animals to try and make it big or transcend social classes. There aren’t a whole lot of ways faster to be honest. Homes are mostly unattainable for the average person — layoffs are increasing and high costs are hurting everyone except the wealthy who do not need to work for income. BowTied Bull has documented this phenomena and so have other high profile crypto influencers like Anthony Pompliano .\nYou could make the argument that this elevated interest in trading and investing really started during Covid 19 when the AMC/Gamestop frenzy began and everyone from your cab driver to your grandma were downloading Robinhood to get in on the action.\nThis degeneracy is sure to continue — as people look for new ways to supplement less effective day job pay and higher costs, they will inevitably turn to the new penny stock casino that is meme coins.\nShare\nAbout 39% of Americans are not contributing to any retirement fund and 30% believe they will never be able to retire comfortably, a recent MSN article says . Twenty-eight percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 65 say they have nothing saved for retirement, according to the article (RepairDrivenNews).\nPeople don’t even have enough to live comfortably right now let alone in retirement. Factor in future inflation or currency devaluation?\nFuture is bleak.\nWhen crypto breaches new all time highs and the euphoria really sets in you’re going to see a mania like you never thought was possible. In crypto rising tides do truly lift all ships and meme coins will be no exception when BTC/ETH start to really run.\nCan you afford to not have SOME exposure to these explosive magical internet coins?\nThat decisions up to you.\nI vote no.\nIf you want an easy and straightforward exchange to buy your Ethereum or Solana on for trading meme coins you can use my Gemini code HERE.\nYou can get set up in 10-15 minutes.\nSome of The Top Meme Coins\nSo let’s talk specifics.\nBut first a disclaimer.\nAs I have stated many times before meme coins are simply a small piece of the equation for me. I have maybe 5% of my total crypto portfolio in the “meme” category. The majority of my stack is Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, Filecoin, and The Graph. For those of you who are new — I like to be completely transparent about my personal allocations.\nThe only new update to my portfolio is that I liquidated my 10,000 MATIC in order to throw some stacks at meme coins. MATIC wasn’t moving fast enough for me and I figure if I rip some quick wins on memes I can get back in for the longer term.\nBack to meme coins — DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.\nSubscribe I could lose all of my meme stacks and be fine — annoyed — but fine. Don’t go gambling your rent or savings you cannot afford to lose chasing green candles. The emotion you bring into it will ruin your judgement.\nThat being said — meme coins offer huge upside if you time them correctly. Even if you are a little late to the party you can ride the momentum and make a nice profit before a big correction or sell off. People are getting ridiculously wealthy off meme coins — you should simply view it like you would any gamble, except if you time meme coins right you have an edge.\nMeme coins are beginning to bleed into main street and Wall Street circles. Bowtied Night-owl of DeFi Education posted the following screenshots on Twitter this week during the peak of meme coin madness. Truth is — these types of insane gains are hard to ignore even if you do work in tradfi and think crypto is a scam or fad. I expect more and more critics to start getting into meme coins as the gains start to add up in the next few weeks.\nBelow are a list of the most talked about and trending meme coins. Let me be clear — I am not endorsing you to ape into these at current levels — some are up thousands or hundreds of percentages already.\nDo your own research (whatever that means for meme coins) and only invest what you could be okay losing. A couple high level pointers when investing in meme coins:\nKeep an eye on market cap — DOGE and SHIBA are former examples of how high some of these market caps can go (billions) but you can eyeball the math and get a sense for what multiple you might be able to make if you’re early enough. For example while the market cap of APU is unclear — it likely only has a 10-20x left. Any higher would be utter insanity (not impossible).\nLook for meme coins that have strong cultish followings or cultural significance — PEPE and Zyn are good examples. The stupider the better in meme coins. I won’t go down the rabbit hole of the insane and sometimes racist Solana meme coins that surfaced weeks ago but many of them ran hard for a week or two\nAlways have a rough exit plan — selling some on a double or higher is generally good advice — just know that oftentimes when you sell it’s too early. Inversely you could end up bag holding a worthless token if you time it wrong. This is gambling make no mistake.\nThe rule of buying ultra red days and selling euphoric green days is doubly important in meme coins. Don’t let FOMO or panic drive you into apeing in at the ultimate top. Don’t let local corrections scare you off of gems\nIf you copy the address listed below - DOUBLE CHECK that it is correct. Cannot emphasize this enough. When you’re dealing with meme coins there are plenty of knock offs and scams that will attempt to catch careless traders or apes by surprise. Always double check.\nShare\nThese are meme coins I think are worth considering either for local short term trades or for longer term holds as we look for a new ATH from both BTC and ETH.\nBODEN - Jeo Boden\nMarket Cap - $562,160,142\nSOL Address: 3psH1Mj1f7yUfaD5gh6Zj7epE8hhrMkMETgv5TshQA4o\nI missed BODEN but the way in which it ripped so fast should warn you of what could happen with other undervalued or fresh meme coins. Oftentimes the dumbest shit rips the hardest. It’s all about how culty the community is and how much control of price whales have.\nBoden was one of the early meme coins that took off after fanatical buyers aped into it. I remember seeing it at around a 50M market cap. Boden and similar Trump cryptos may do very well leading into the next election.\nWIF - dogwifhat\nMarket Cap - $3,532,571,870\nETH Address: 0xd1d2eb1b1e90b638588728b4130137d262c87cae\nAnother that I was simply too late too — WIF made many traders and investors who got in early pretty rich. After rejecting the $3.30 support level yesterday, WIF has surged past its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the 4-hour chart, a bullish technical signal (Watcher Guru).\n$4.00 is the next level most people are hoping for.\nPAC - PACMOON\nMarket Cap - Unknown\nBlast Address: 0x5ffd9ebd27f2fcab044c0f0a26a45cb62fa29c06\nIf you read our paid posts (which I highly suggest doing) you are well aware of the Blast Airdrop coming up in May and all of the dApps (decentralized applications) that live in this ecosystem. There are countless ways to airdrop farm and make money — and I mean make literal free money. PAC is the community token of PACMOON.\nSubscribe Two airdrops have already happened and a third is scheduled for the end of April. If you want to participate and become eligible just go to the PACMOON website and check out the details for airdrop 3. You basically just post content. So far I have made 40,000 PAC for free and PAC is trading at $0.10 — so a literal free $4,000. I of course wasn’t happy with just he airdrop so I bought more and sit on a nice bag of about 110K PAC all of which I have staked on Wasabi to earn both yield AND points/gold that will increase my Blast allocation in May.\nPAC is in it’s true infancy but the community on District One and Twitter is insane. Highly suggest taking a look.\nPEPE - Pepe\nMarket Cap - $2,886,637,314\nETH Address: 0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933\nPepe has always been a meme that I have loved online — be it on the depths of 4chan or on various business forums. I have always found PEPE memes to be hilarious and the fact they were controversial and banned from twitter at one point makes the joke even better. I am turned $5,000 into $15,000 with PEPE in a matter of days — for now I am holding this position for much higher.\nZYN - Zyncoin\nMarket Cap - $63,611,366\nETH Address: 0x58cb30368ceb2d194740b144eab4c2da8a917dcb\nI obviously love upper decky’s so when I came across Zyn Coin a few months ago I had to part ways with some of my ETH to get in on the action.\nThe project is innovating in some cool ways as well — touting an effort to allow investors to redeem actual Zyn cans for more shares in the project. Meme coins gain a large part of their potential pump power from cultural significance and awareness and if you work in finance or tech chances are you know about Zyn.\nI think I will back another upper decky and buy some more today.\nAPU -Apu Apustaja\nMarket Cap - Unclear\nETH Address: 0x594daad7d77592a2b97b725a7ad59d7e188b5bfa\nAPU is arguably one of the best options on this list. For those who aren’t familiar with the lord APU is the internet frog meme and the little brother of PEPE. There’s a competitive race between APU and PEPE on 4chan and Twitter. The communities are both fanatic. I hold both and think they’ll both turbo pump in the coming month or two. One check of twitter or other channels will show you just how psychotic and fanatic APU shills and traders are. There has been some massive whales accumulating this during the last several days.\nSubscribe\nSQUID - Squidward Coin\nMarket Cap - $2,350,000\nETH Address: 0xa1a92f15c24ad358c3a4d0a8ba4f7db18fbfab2f\nDon’t know much about this except for my brother having a position. Could be a solid low market cap pick. 4Chan is discussing the merit of picking SQUID over APU. Pay attention to blogs, 4Chan Biz channels, and twitter to get the latest sentiment check on some of these smaller coins.\nANDY - ANDY\nMarket cap - $46,000,000\nAddress - 0x68BbEd6A47194EFf1CF514B50Ea91895597fc91E\nAndy is not affiliated with Arbitrage Andy - it is the brother token of PEPE. With a smaller market cap this could be one to keep on eye on — today the chart looks solid with a pullback from local highs over the last week or so.\nIf you want some ideas of others to look into check out this list of the top performing meme coins from Coinmarketcap. The top ones as of now are listed below.\nIf you want to get fully up to speed on meme coins and the craze in markets right now check out the post below after today’s.\nMeme Coins & Crypto Liftoff Arbitrage Andy · Mar 5\nIf there was any remaining doubt that crypto is lifting off and is here to stay — it is gone. If there is one crypto post I put out that you should read — it’s this one. I am getting dozens and dozens of DMs on when to enter the market, what to buy, and what strategies to employ and the truth is, it’s a bit frustrating (though expected) given I have been covering this in Arb Letter for the better part of a year and a half.\nRead full story",

    "text": "Dr. Noah Marchese, owner of HealthChoice Center in Peachtree City, is offering a cutting-edge approach to treating soft tissues through the use of SoftWave therapy, a non-invasive treatment that utilizes acoustic sound waves to assist with the regeneration and healing of soft tissue.\nAccording to Dr. Marchese, this advanced technology is changing the outcome for patients throughout the natural healing process. Clinics, like HealthChoice, that have adopted this practice are reporting a reduction in pain, decreased inflammation, and increased range of motion, – providing relief and allowing the patient to return to their optimal function and getting back to their normal everyday activities.\nSoftWave therapy has shown positive results for musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis, shoulder/ rotator cuff injuries, knee pain, peripheral neuropathy, plantar fasciitis, tennis/ golfers elbow, and tendonitis. At HealthChoice Center, Dr. Marchese has worked with many local student athletes as well as professional athletes who have suffered injuries that once sidelined them. Through the use of SoftWave, they have been able to return to their sports without the need for more invasive treatments or surgeries.\n“Recently, we had a local student who suffered from a rotary cuff injury while pitching early in the season. He went to a few doctors who told him he would be unable to pitch the entire year and may even need surgery to recover.” said Dr. Marchese. “ After not getting any results, he decided to come to our office and try softwave. We completed a few sessions of softwave around the entire rotator cuff and deltoid muscles of his pitching arm, and he was back to pitching better and faster than he was even previous to his injury.”\nIt’s also incredible to help treat the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. “ By its ability to reduce the inflammation and increase blood flow while regenerating nerves. We are just very excited to share this technology with the community and provide a place for people to come to help treat their chronic pain.” said Dr. Marchese.\nPatients interested in exploring this new therapy are first booked for a $49 mapping session, where Dr. Marchese evaluates the joints to locate the damaged or inflamed tissue. The mapping session also includes the first round of treatment.\nSoftWave can also be a cost-effective alternative to surgery, supporting long-term recovery by enhancing physical function and potentially lowering the overall cost of care.\nTo learn more or to schedule a consultation, call Dr. Noah Marchese’s practice, HealthChoice Center, at 770-408-0184, or visit the website at www.peachtreecitychiropractor.com.",

    "title": "Pope Francis: Building Peace Requires ‘Taking a Risk’| National Catholic Register",
    "text": "Pope Francis: Building Peace Requires ‘Taking a Risk’ Francis emphasized that the model par excellence of a peacemaker is Jesus Christ. Being peacemakers in the style of Jesus Christ, while necessary and valuable, can also be risky, Pope Francis said on Saturday, as multiple conflicts continue to rage around the world. Speaking to members of Italian Christian Workers’ Associations (ACLI) at the Vatican on June 1, the Pontiff said, “Interceding for peace is something that goes far beyond mere political compromise because it requires putting oneself on the line and taking a risk.” “Our world, we know, is marked by conflict and division, and your witness as peacemakers, as intercessors for peace, is as necessary and valuable as ever,” he underlined. Pope Francis’ remarks about a world “bloodied by many wars” came as Israel and Hamas consider proposals for an exchange of hostages and a cease-fire. “This is truly a decisive moment,” U.S. President Joe Biden said at the White House on Friday, as he unveiled Israel’s three-phase proposal for ending the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will not end the war in Gaza until its aims have been achieved. The Israeli military also confirmed Friday it is carrying out an operation in the center of the southern Gazan city of Rafah, which the United Nations said has been reduced to “apocalyptic conditions.” Last month, Russia began a surprise offensive on Ukraine’s northern border, in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The assault has forced Ukraine to move already thinly spread resources away from other front lines as it attempts to prevent Russia’s capture of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city. In Sudan, millions of people are fleeing the conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces as civil war continues to bring devastation over one year later. The U.N. has called the conflict “a humanitarian nightmare,” as the country experiences a massive hunger crisis and other human-rights atrocities, with the dead numbering around 15,000. In his speech June 1, Pope Francis recalled the words of the late Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, spoken at a prayer vigil for peace on Jan. 29, 1991. The cardinal “laid emphasis on the ability to ‘intercede,’ that is, to situate oneself between the contending parties, putting a hand on the shoulder of both and accepting the risk that this entails,” the Pope said. The person who builds peace is the one, he continued, “who knows how to take a clear position, but at the same time strives to build bridges, to listen, and to understand the different parties involved, promoting dialogue and reconciliation.” Francis also emphasized that the model par excellence of a peacemaker is Jesus Christ. “Where can we find inspiration and strength to welcome everyone if not in the life of Jesus?” he said. It is good to take time for prayer at association meetings, he told the group, but living out the Christian life goes further. “Assuming a Christian style means growing in familiarity with the Lord and in the spirit of the Gospel,” the Pope said, “so that it may permeate everything we do and our actions have the style of Christ and make him present in the world.” “In the face of cultural visions that threaten to nullify the beauty of human dignity and tear society apart, I invite you to cultivate ‘a new dream of fraternity and social friendship that is not limited to words,’” he emphasized, quoting his 2020 encyclical Fratelli Tutti. Pope Francis also praised the association for promoting democracy. A democratic society, he said, is one “in which there really is a place for everyone, in factual reality and not just in declarations and on paper.” - Keywords: [peace](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/peace) [prayers for peace](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/prayers-for-peace) [peacemakers](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/peacemakers)",

    "text": "Thursday, 01 February 2024 05:11 PM EST The planned targets for U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the killing of three U.S. soldiers by a drone in Jordan include \"Iranian personnel and facilities,\" CBS News reported on Thursday, citing American officials. The CBS report said the plans had been approved by the Biden administration in response to the lethal drone strike and other drone and rocket attacks targeting U.S. forces in the region. Speaking at the Pentagon Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said America won't tolerate attacks on American troops. \"We will continue to work to avoid a wider conflict in the region, but we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our interests and our people, and we will respond when we choose, where we choose and how we choose.\" The United States has assessed that the latest drone, which also wounded more than 40 people, was made by Iran, four U.S. officials told Reuters. Sources said Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards were pulling senior officers out of Syria. The CBS report follows days of conjecture about how Washington would retaliate after three U.S. soldiers were killed on Saturday in a strike on their base. The fatalities were the first U.S. deaths in an escalation of violence across the Middle East since Israel's war in Gaza began in October. Even as fighting has intensified this week, diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave have accelerated. Qatari and Egyptian mediators presented Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, with the first concrete proposal for an extended halt to fighting, agreed with Israel and the U.S. at talks in Paris last week. A Palestinian official close to the negotiations told Reuters the text envisages a first phase of 40 days, during which fighting would cease while Hamas freed remaining civilians among the more than 100 hostages it still holds. Further phases would see the handover of Israeli soldiers and bodies of dead hostages. Such a long pause would be a first since Oct. 7, when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, precipitating an Israeli offensive that has laid waste to much of Gaza. Health officials in the enclave said on Thursday the confirmed Palestinian death toll had risen above 27,000, with thousands more dead still lying under the rubble. A Palestinian official said Hamas was unlikely to reject the proposal outright, but would demand guarantees that fighting would not resume, something Israel has not agreed to. REPORTS OF CEASEFIRE DEAL ARE DENIED A positive-sounding speech by a Qatari spokesman at Johns Hopkins University in Washington briefly triggered some celebrations in Gaza - and a drop in the price of crude oil. But a Qatari official in Doha told Reuters there was no ceasefire deal yet, and that Hamas had \"received the proposal positively\" but not responded yet. And Taher Al-Nono, media adviser to Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, told Reuters: \"We have received the proposal that was put together in Paris but we haven’t yet given a response to any of the parties.\" \"We can’t say that the current stage of negotiation is zero and at the same time we can’t say that we have reached an agreement.\" Celebratory firing into the air and cheering in central and southern Gaza were soon suppressed by an air strike on a house in Gaza's main southern city, Khan Younis, that wounded 13 people, according to hospital officials. Israel started a huge ground assault last week to capture Khan Younis, and combat has also surged in northern areas that Israel claimed to have subdued weeks ago. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israeli forces had now dismantled the Hamas brigade in Khan Younis, and that they had killed 10,000 Palestinian fighters and wounded the same number again since the war began nearly four months ago. He said those forces would now press on to Rafah on the enclave's southern edge, where more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people are sheltering, mainly cold and hungry in makeshift tents and public buildings. Residents said Israeli forces had pounded areas around hospitals in Khan Younis overnight, and stepped up attacks close to Rafah. Osama Ahmed, 49, a father of five from Gaza City now sheltering in western Khan Younis, said there had been fierce resistance in the city, and relentless bombardment from air, ground and sea as Israeli tanks advanced. \"They haven’t entered deep into Al-Mawasi where we live but every day they get closer,\" he told Reuters by phone. \"All we want is a ceasefire now.\" U.S. PUTS PRESSURE ON ISRAEL Appeals to Israel from its main ally, the United States, show little sign of having succeeded in easing the plight of Gaza's civilians. Washington is stepping up indirect pressure, however. U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order that aims to punish Jewish settlers who attack Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in an surge of violence triggered by the war in Gaza. Biden is also under pressure to respond firmly to the killing of U.S. soldiers - which Washington says bears the \"footprints\" of Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia based in neighboring Iraq - without igniting a wider war with Iran. That group said on Wednesday it was suspending military action against U.S. forces to avoid embarrassing Baghdad. Iran's Revolutionary Guards, who have lost more than half a dozen of their members to Israeli strikes since December, are pulling their senior officers out of Syria, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Iranian advisers assist armed groups in both Iraq, where the U.S. has around 2,500 troops, and Syria, where it has 900. The CBS report quoted U.S. officials as saying weather would be a factor in the timing of the retaliatory U.S. strikes as Washington preferred good visibility to guard against the risk of hitting civilians. Further afield, the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which controls the most populous parts of Yemen, has attacked shipping in the Red Sea in what it says is solidarity with Gaza, drawing retaliatory strikes from the United States and Britain. Overnight, the U.S. military said it had hit up to 10 drones in Yemen being prepared for launch, while a U.S. Navy ship downed three Iranian-made drones and a Houthi anti-ship missile. Two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen hit the water rather than their likely target, the Liberian-flagged, Bermuda-owned freighter M/V KOI, U.S. Central Command said. © 2024 Thomson/Reuters.

    "title": "Rare Childhood Metabolic Crises Explained by Fat Transport Deficiency",
    "text": "Researchers at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona have made a groundbreaking discovery regarding a protein linked to TANGO2 Deficiency Disorder (TDD), a severe condition affecting children’s metabolic health. The study, published in the Journal of Cell Biology, provides critical insights into how cells manage energy demands during metabolic crises, paving the way for potential new treatment avenues. TDD is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the TANGO2 gene, and experts estimate there are between 6,000 and 9,000 undiagnosed cases globally, highlighting the urgent need for improved diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.\nHistorically, the TANGO gene family, discovered by scientists in 2006, has been a focus of research due to its role in cellular metabolism. Among these genes, TANGO2 has emerged as a significant player in energy production, particularly in high-demand situations such as during periods of exertion or illness. It’s essential to understand that the human body primarily relies on carbohydrates for energy under normal conditions. However, during crises, particularly metabolic ones, the body shifts to metabolizing lipids for energy—a process crucial for maintaining the function of critical organs, such as the heart.\nChildren diagnosed with TDD experience life-threatening metabolic crises marked by a dramatic decrease in blood sugar levels, muscle breakdown, and severe cardiac irregularities. These episodes often arise from strenuous activities, infections, or even situations as mundane as skipping a meal. Families of children with TDD often find themselves in precarious positions with limited knowledge of the disorder, leading to potentially devastating consequences when emergencies arise. Intensive interventions, such as administering glucose via intravenous (IV) methods, are frequently the only recourse available when crises occur.\nThe research team, led by ICREA Research Professor Vivek Malhotra, has delved deep into the molecular functionalities of TANGO2 over the past decade. Their recent findings reveal that TANGO2 is localized in the mitochondria—often referred to as the cell’s powerhouse—indicating its critical role in energy metabolism. This discovery was key in understanding why disruptions in TANGO2 function lead to significant cellular consequences. The researchers noted that TANGO2-deficient cells show an alarming accumulation of fat droplets and an increase in reactive oxygen species, suggesting that these cells cannot properly utilize lipids, which are essential for energy production.\nIn their recent article, the researchers describe how TANGO2 binds to acyl-CoA, a vital fat molecule. This binding process suggests that TANGO2 acts as a shuttle, transporting acyl-CoA within the cells, thus facilitating lipid metabolism. The innovative approach taken by the scientists to track TANGO2’s movement involved tagging the protein with fluorescent markers, allowing for the real-time observation of its dynamics in living cells. Such methodologies not only elucidate the roles of proteins in cellular energy processes but also bring to light the intricate workings of cellular metabolism under varying physiological conditions.\nUnderstanding the mechanics of lipid metabolism in TDD patients has substantial implications. Dr. Agustin Lujan, the first author of the study, emphasized that TANGO2’s facilitation of lipid utilization is crucial for preventing energy starvation in affected children. The inability of TANGO2-deficient cells to efficiently process necessary lipid forms profoundly impacts energy availability, underscoring the metabolic vulnerability of individuals with TDD. This research paves the way for identifying new therapeutic interventions tailored to these unique cellular mechanisms.\nCurrently, one of the limited treatment options for patients with TDD involves administering high doses of Vitamin B5, which is integral for synthesizing Coenzyme A, a vital molecule in lipid metabolism. While some patients appear to benefit from Vitamin B5 supplements, the exact mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear. It is hypothesized that the vitamin may augment residual energy pathways that are otherwise compromised in TANGO2 deficiency, but further research is essential to confirm these findings and optimize treatment strategies.\nThe ramifications of these findings extend beyond TDD and may have broader applications for understanding metabolic disorders more generally. Dr. Malhotra articulated that the insights from TANGO2 research could illuminate the underlying biochemical pathways relevant in prevalent conditions associated with fat metabolism irregularities, such as heart diseases and obesity. By dissecting the unique biology of TDD, researchers may unveil foundational principles that apply across various metabolic disorders affecting millions of individuals.\nAs the research team, including Dr. Lujan and co-author Ombretta Foresti, continues to probe the functions of TANGO2, their objectives include clarifying how TANGO2 engages with acyl-CoA and determining whether it interacts with other mitochondrial enzymes during energy-demanding times. This work is not merely academic; it holds the potential for developing targeted therapies that could lead to improved patient outcomes and quality of life for families dealing with TDD.\nStrikingly, this research couldn’t have been conducted without the valuable collaboration between scientists, medical professionals, and patient advocacy groups like the TANGO2 Research Foundation. By pooling resources and patient data, this collaborative effort ensures that research is grounded in real-world experiences and needs, ultimately enhancing translational science.\nFor families with children affected by TDD, each increment of progress in understanding this disorder is a source of hope. Parents like Mike Morris and Kasha Morris, founders of the TANGO2 Research Foundation, affirm the importance of scientific research in aiding families navigating the complexities of this condition. They express gratitude towards the ongoing efforts of the scientific community for their relentless pursuit of knowledge and improvement of care strategies, framing every new finding as a step closer to understanding and potentially mitigating the challenges posed by TDD.\nIn summary, researchers are continuing to chip away at the mystery of TANGO2 deficiency, with each study shedding new light on this potentially life-threatening condition. By unraveling the molecular underpinnings of TANGO2, experts hope to foster improved diagnostic measures and develop innovative treatment regimens that can significantly impact patient management. This research not only has the power to alter the course of TDD but may also contribute to a more profound comprehension of metabolic disorders at large.\nSubject of Research : TANGO2 Deficiency Disorder (TDD)\nArticle Title : Researchers Uncover Critical Insights into TANGO2 Deficiency Disorder, Offering Hope for New Treatments\nNews Publication Date : [To be determined based on publishing schedule]\nWeb References : [To be determined based on publishing links]\nReferences : [To be determined based on research citations]\nImage Credits : Credit: Agustin Lujan/Centro de Regulación Genómica\nKeywords : TANGO2, Deficiency Disorder, Metabolic Crisis, Energy Metabolism, Lipid Utilization, Coenzyme A, Vitamin B5, Cellular Energy, Mitochondria, Rare Disease, TANGO2 Research Foundation, Metabolic Disorders",

    "text": "Singapore Airlines, British Airways y Lufthansa han aumentado sus vuelos sobre Afganistán tras años de evitarlo en gran medida ahora que el conflicto de Oriente Próximo ha hecho que parezca una opción relativamente segura. La mayoría de las compañías dejaron de transitar por Afganistán, que se encuentra en las principales rutas entre Asia y Europa, hace tres años, cuando los talibanes tomaron el poder y se interrumpieron los servicios de control del tráfico aéreo.\nEsos servicios aún no se han reanudado, pero las compañías aéreas consideran cada vez más que los cielos entre Irán e Israel son más arriesgados que el espacio aéreo afgano. Muchas habían empezado a hacer rutas a través de Irán y Oriente Próximo después de que los cielos rusos se cerraran a la mayoría de las compañías occidentales cuando empezó la guerra de Ucrania en 2022.\n\"A medida que los conflictos han evolucionado, el cálculo de qué espacio aéreo utilizar ha cambiado. Las aerolíneas buscan mitigar el riesgo en la medida de lo posible y consideran que sobrevolar Afganistán es la opción más segura dadas las actuales tensiones entre Irán e Israel\", declaró Ian Petchenik, portavoz de la organización de seguimiento de vuelos Flightradar24.\nEn la segunda semana de agosto hubo más de siete veces más vuelos sobre Afganistán que en el mismo periodo de hace un año, según un análisis de Reuters de los datos de FlightRadar24.\nEl cambio comenzó a mediados de abril, durante los ataques recíprocos con misiles y aviones no tripulados entre Irán e Israel. Los datos de seguimiento de vuelos de la época muestran que Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, British Airways y otras compañías comenzaron a enviar algunos vuelos al día sobre Afganistán.\nPero el principal crecimiento se ha producido desde que el asesinato de altos cargos de los grupos militantes Hamás y Hezbolá a finales de julio suscitó la preocupación de una escalada mayor.\nAlgunos pilotos están preocupados.\n\"Dependes del análisis de tu compañía aérea. Cada vez que vuelo allí, no me gusta la sensación de sobrevolar una zona de conflicto en la que no sabes, en realidad, lo que está ocurriendo\", dijo Otjan de Bruin, piloto comercial y director de la Asociación Europea de Pilotos.\n\"Siempre es suficientemente seguro, hasta que se demuestre lo contrario\".\nLufthansa Group dijo a Reuters que había decidido reanudar el sobrevuelo del espacio aéreo afgano desde principios de julio.\nOtras compañías que han aumentado los sobrevuelos desde abril son Turkish Airlines, Thai Airways y el grupo Air France-KLM, según muestran los datos.\n\"Basándonos en la información real sobre seguridad, KLM y otras compañías aéreas sobrevuelan actualmente Afganistán de forma segura sólo en rutas específicas y únicamente a gran altitud\", declaró KLM a Reuters.\nBritish Airways, Thai Airways, Turkish Airlines y Singapore Airlines no respondieron a las solicitudes de comentarios.\nLa taiwanesa EVA Air comenzó a hacerlo a finales de julio, según muestran los datos de seguimiento de los vuelos. EVA dijo a Reuters que elige las rutas en función de la seguridad, la situación internacional actual y los avisos de vuelo.\nEL PAPEL DE LA REGULACIÓN\nLos cambios de ruta se han visto facilitados por la relajación de las directrices sobre Afganistán por parte de los reguladores de la aviación.\nA principios de julio, la Administración Federal de Aviación estadounidense (FAA) dijo que los aviones podían volar a menor altitud sobre una franja del noreste de Afganistán, el corredor de Wakhan, que se utiliza para cruzar de Tayikistán a Pakistán, abriendo esa ruta a más tipos de vuelos.\nUn año antes, la FAA levantó su prohibición de sobrevolar todo el país, pero dijo que los aviones debían mantenerse por encima de los 32.000 pies (9.753,6 m), donde las armas tierra-aire se consideran menos eficaces.\nPero pocos empezaron a utilizar Afganistán hasta abril.\nAunque un mayor tráfico ha estado utilizando el espacio aéreo sin incidentes, no hay garantías de seguridad para la tripulación o los pasajeros si un avión tiene que aterrizar, dijo en julio el grupo de seguridad de vuelo OPSGROUP.\nA falta de control del tráfico aéreo, los pilotos que cruzan Afganistán hablan por radio con los aviones cercanos según un protocolo elaborado por el organismo de aviación de la ONU, la OACI, y la Autoridad de Aviación Civil de Afganistán.\nEl regulador europeo de la seguridad aérea, EASA, afirmó en un boletín informativo sobre zonas de conflicto reeditado en julio que \"los grupos extremistas de actores no estatales siguen activos y podrían atentar esporádicamente contra las instalaciones de aviación de múltiples maneras\".\nLa industria está atormentada por el recuerdo del vuelo MH17 de Malaysian Airlines que se dirigía de Ámsterdam a Kuala Lumpur y que fue derribado sobre el este de Ucrania en 2014, mientras se libraban combates entre los separatistas prorrusos y las fuerzas ucranianas.\nCOSTE Y OPCIONES LIMITADAS\nLas aerolíneas están bajo presión para ahorrar dinero tras la pérdida desde 2022 de muchas rutas más cortas a través del espacio aéreo ruso, y mientras se reconstruyen tras la pandemia.\nHay pocas normas internacionales que dicten qué zonas del espacio aéreo son seguras y las decisiones de seguridad de las aerolíneas se dejan en gran medida a la discreción de cada compañía.\nSi una compañía aérea no puede volar a través de Rusia, Ucrania o Irán, el centro de Afganistán ofrece una ruta más directa hacia el sur de Asia desde Europa.\n\"Esta ruta nos ahorró bastante tiempo y combustible\", informó OPSGROUP de un piloto que en julio voló de Ámsterdam a Kuala Lumpur atravesando el centro de Afganistán.\nComparte Acceder al artículo original .\nAviso legal Aviso legal\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros para cualquier solicitud de corrección\nVolver © Reuters - 2024",
