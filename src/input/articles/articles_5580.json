    "text": "I Tried Dolly Parton’s Pecan Chicken Salad and It Was So Good, It’s Now in My Lunch Rotation\nindependentlyselect these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\nWith an origin dating back to 1863, one of the first amalgamations of\nchicken salad was dreamed up by Liam Gray, owner of Town Meats in Wakefield, Rhode Island. His version combined leftover chicken with mayonnaise, tarragon, and grapes, and was so popular that eventually the meat market would pivot into a delicatessen. With influence like that, it’s no wonder chicken salad is still a staple in American cuisine, garnering the respect of countless chefs and celebrities alike, and somehow, never seeming to get old.\nWhile there are plenty of variations of chicken salad to try out,\nDolly Parton — someone whose tastes are taken very seriously around here — happens to have a delicious chicken salad recipe that uses only a few ingredients, but is an absolute powerhouse. And if anyone knows the struggle of working 9 to 5 and needing an easy, yet delicious meal that can be thrown together in minutes, it’s the Queen of Country herself. So, I decided to pour myself a little cup of ambition and see what all the fuss was about with Dolly Parton’s Pecan Chicken Salad. And let me tell you, I was far from disappointed.\nGet the recipe:\nDolly Parton’s Pecan Chicken Salad\nHow to Make Dolly Parton’s Pecan Chicken Salad\nStart by poaching your chicken in boiling water until it has reached an internal temperature of 165°F, about 10 to 12 minutes. While the chicken cools, dice your celery stalks and one small onion before adding to a large mixing bowl. Next, dice the chicken into small cubes and add to the bowl along with pecan halves, mayonnaise, and Dijon mustard. Mix everything well with a spatula.\nThen using two forks, shred the chicken ensuring that you use your own discretion for how thin you want it to be. Finally, season with salt and pepper, then serve on a plate with a bed of watercress as the base.\nMy Honest Opinion of Dolly Parton’s Pecan Chicken Salad\nGrowing up, I was always a ride-or-die kid when it came to mayonnaise. Regrettably, I would put mayonnaise on everything, but somewhere along the line, I slowly lost my taste for it. Because of that, I was less likely to seek out chicken salad over the years — even if it was readily available to me. It was almost to a point where I would just think that I didn’t like it anymore. Being that it’s been quite a while since I had even a bite of chicken salad, I was both excited to try Dolly’s recipe and nervous that I was making something that I would otherwise not want to finish. But boy was I wrong, because with the first bite, I was instantly met with a feeling of nostalgia and couldn’t help but finish my serving.\nThe only ingredient I could do without, however, was the pecans — but even that was not a deal-breaker, and I found myself eating them anyway because each bite was just that dang tasty. Though I don’t believe Dolly’s chicken salad will make me the master mayonnaise connoisseur I once was when growing up, it did remind me that I love chicken salad. And I will most certainly be adding this back into my cooking rotation.\n3 Tips for Making Dolly Parton’s Pecan Chicken Salad\n- Don’t skip the shredding. The more you’re able to shred your chicken, the better the mayonnaise and Dijon mustard will incorporate into every crevice, leaving no dry bite in sight.\n- No nuts, no problem. If you have a nut allergy, or just aren’t a fan of them in general, remove the pecans from the equation and the recipe will still be just as amazing. In my opinion, it’s the other ingredients that really tie this chicken salad together; the pecans are just a bonus.\n- Adjust, taste, and repeat. While Dolly’s instructions are a fantastic guideline to follow, if you find the recipe lacking in any way, try adjusting the ingredient amounts until you like what you taste. For example, add more Dijon mustard, mix, taste, then repeat if needed.\nGet the recipe:\nDolly Parton’s Pecan Chicken Salad",

    "title": "Rainfall warnings issued around Golden Horseshoe as storms brew",
    "text": "Rainfall warnings are in effect throughout parts of the Golden Horseshoe on Thursday evening as classic pop-up thunderstorms brew in the steamy summertime air. Not everyone will see the rain this afternoon, but communities that do encounter one of these storms will endure torrential downpours until the storm fizzles out or moves on. Look out for reduced visibility, ponding on roadways, and the risk for localized flooding in vulnerable areas as these thunderstorms drench the region. DON’T MISS: How weather and landscape set the stage for Toronto&#039;s latest flood These hit-or-miss storms will drench portions of the region through the evening commute. Prepare for slowdowns and possible detours if localized flooding occurs. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) issued a rainfall warning for the southern half of the Golden Horseshoe on Thursday afternoon in anticipation of these heavy storms bubbling over the region. The warning includes the City of Hamilton, Simcoe, St. Catharines, and the northern Niagara region. “Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads,” ECCC said in its warning. Remember, never attempt to drive across a flooded roadway. It&#039;s impossible to tell how deep the water is until it&#039;s too late, and it only takes a little bit of moving water to lift a vehicle and carry it away. Forecasters expect the storm activity to simmer down as we draw closer to sunset this evening. Stay with The Weather Network for all the latest on conditions across Ontario.

Ahora ha sido probado con éxito en campo de tiro de las islas Hébridas, en Escocia, lo que supone un \"gran paso\" hacia su uso militar.\nEl ministro de Defensa británico, Grant Shapps, ha destacado que esta tecnologia reduce \"la dependencia de caras municiones y reduce el riesgo de daños colaterales\".\nEl DragonFire podría estar próximamente integrado en el sistema de defensa del Ejército de Tierra y de la Marina, ha resaltado Londres, con lo que se sumaría a Estados Unidos, que ya cuenta con esta tecnología en varios destructores de la Marina.\nActualmente los misiles y proyectiles antiaéreos utilizados en conflictos como el de Yemen o Ucrania cuestan mucho más que los drones que derriban, por lo que varios países investigan alternativas más eficaces. El DragonFire en concreto ha recibido ya inversiones por 100 millones de libras (unos 116 millones de euros).\n- item no encontrado",

    "title": "Was Bob Uecker a golf fan? Exploring the late sportscaster's passion for the game",
    "text": "Late Milwaukee Brewers' sportscaster Bob Uecker had carved an indelible place for himself in the world of sports. Along with being a legendary baseball personality, he was also a passionate golfer.\nAlthough, he soon learned to love the game, his first brush with golf was \"pretty frustrating\". He talked about his experience on the greens in a 2020 interview with Golf.com.\n\"Back when I was playing pro baseball. It was pretty frustrating at first. The ball’s sitting up on a tee, but I’d hit it out of bounds, or hook it, or hit a grounder. It’s not like you’ve got some guy throwing a pitch 100 miles an hour at you,\"\nHe told David Feherty when he appeared on the latter's Golf Channel show in 2016 that he only began to grow fond of golf when he started playing the pros in charity events. Those instances helped him understand the sport better (via Golf Week).\n\"I love the game of golf. I didn't really appreciate it until I started playing a round of golf with you guys. I could see how you can move a ball one way or the other. The chipping game, the short game, how tough that is. It's unbelievably tough,\"\nUecker was a man of many talents, and humour was perhaps one of the biggest of them. He had an amusing answer when asked about his golfing abilities (via Golf.com).\n\"I could put a stick of dynamite in my driver and still only hit it 200 yards,\"\nOn David Feherty's show, the voice of Milwaukee Brewers also drew comparisons between his frustrations in both of his favorite sports (via Golf Week).\n\"In baseball, if we hit a pitch that's in on our hands, so to speak, like right above the handle ... it can be a little blooper to right field. That's good. That's a base hit. You don't hit it good, but it's a base hit. If you guys do that, you're really in trouble,\"\nIn 2015, he even organized an eponymous Bob Uecker Front Row Classic at the Greyhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale. The golf event was beneficial towards the charitable Make-A-Wish Foundation. The baseball Hall of Famer was involved in several charitable initiatives.\nLovingly called as 'Mr. Baseball', he had a .200 batting average when he played baseball. The legendary sportscaster was diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer in 2023. He passed away on Thursday at the age of 90.\nMilwaukee Brewers pay their respects to Bob Uecker saying \"#ThankYouUeck\"\nBob Uecker had become synonymous with the Milwaukee Brewers, serving as the team's sportscaster for almost 54 years. On Thursday, the team paid its respects to the legend by posting heartfelt messages pouring in from friends, family, and players alike.\nThe team's social media profile pictures were changed to \"UECK\" with a baseball glove. The caption read \"#ThankYouUeck\".\nBob Uecker made a profound impact on the world through his broadcasting. His demise is truly a tremendous loss to the sporting world.",

    "title": "On Christmas Eve, Bethlehem resembles a ghost town. Celebrations are halted due to Israel-Hamas war. | The Independent",
    "text": "The normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus resembled a ghost town on Sunday, as Christmas Eve celebrations in Bethlehem were called off due to the Israel- Hamas war.The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square were missing, as were the throngs of foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrolled the empty square. The gift shops were slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did once the rain had stopped pouring down. There were few visitors, however. “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness,” said Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years. He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, reminiscent of the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounded the scene, the grey rubble reflecting none of the joyous lights and bursts of color that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to,” said Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square. Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” said Salameh. This year, just one table was taken, by journalists taking a break from the rain.Salameh said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and wasn’t able to cover operating costs. He estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income — almost all of that during the Christmas season.With many major airlines canceling flights to Israel , few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say over 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed.Over 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault Oct. 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages.The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since Oct. 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

    "text": "La guerre en Ukraine est passée à un autre chapitre depuis que Joe Biden a autorisé les Ukrainiens à utiliser des armes américaines en profondeur dans le territoire de la Russie, et le président russe est loin d’être resté muet, avance le collaborateur Stéphan Bureau.\n• À lire aussi: [Tout d’une «guerre mondiale»: Poutine n’exclut pas de frapper les pays occidentaux](https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2024/11/21/tout-dune-guerre-mondiale-poutine-nexclue-pas-de-frapper-les-pays-occidentaux)\n«Le président Poutine a répondu par la bouche de ses canons», indique l’analyste lors du segment Le Point de vue de Stéphan Bureau du bulletin de 22h.\nVladimir Poutine a fait l’utilisation, jeudi, d’un «nouveau type de missile hypersonique» qui pourrait transporter une ogive nucléaire pour mener une frappe en Ukraine, une première dans l’Histoire de l’humanité, a d’ailleurs avancé l’AFP.\nHeureusement, le missile était dénué de sa tête nucléaire, mais cette attaque envoie tout de même un message clair: la Russie a non seulement la capacité d’attaquer son voisin avec des armes nucléaires, mais a aussi la doctrine qui permet de le faire.\n«On savait que ça s’en venait, il avait menacé de le faire, mais la doctrine militaire russe a changé en matière d’utilisation des armes nucléaires, mentionne M. Bureau. Donc maintenant, ce que dit la Russie, ce que dit l’armée russe, c’est que l’existence du pays n’a pas besoin d’être menacée pour qu’on puisse considérer l’emploi des armes nucléaires. C’est très, très important.»\nAinsi, le recours à l’arme nucléaire n’est plus un «scénario de dernier ressort» en Russie.\n«Nous considérons être dans notre droit d’utiliser nos armes contre les installations militaires des pays qui autorisent l’utilisation de leurs armes contre nos installations», a justement averti M. Poutine jeudi.\nEt cette évolution fait monter la cagnotte, et surtout les risques, dans cette partie de poker que se livrent les États-Unis et la Russie puisqu’un mauvais calcul, ne pas être capable de lire si son opposant dit vrai ou «bluff», pourrait être catastrophique, illustre M. Bureau.\n«On a passé beaucoup de temps entre 2014 et 2022 à dire: \"Les Russes ne traverseront jamais cette vraie ligne rouge qui est la frontière entre eux et l’Ukraine, ils ont fini par le faire\"», rappelle-t-il.\n«Il y a une guerre psychologique qui a pour objectif de contaminer l’ennemi, de lui faire peur ou de le mettre dans une zone où il va douter, explique-t-il. Il faut toujours faire très attention.»\nVoyez Le Point de vue de Stéphan Bureau dans la vidéo ci-dessus.",
