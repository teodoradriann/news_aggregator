Photograph: Blair Gable/Reuters However, the offences do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate, Durham Regional Police said in a press release on Thursday.\nThe police identified the man as Jagdish Pandher from Brampton city.\n According to the press release, in the early hours of October 8, police responded to a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering.\nPandher was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes. He fled the area before police arrival, it said.\nHe was 'seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax', the release said.\nPolice say the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year.\n\"These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,\" they said.\nPandher has been charged with four counts of break-and-enter among other charges, the release said.",

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST MANCHESTER, England :Three late goals from Amad Diallo dragged a below-par Manchester United to an unlikely 3-1 comeback victory over bottom side Southampton in the Premier League on Thursday.\nUnited will have fancied their chances of getting back to winning ways against struggling Saints but the hosts were second best from the off, deservedly falling behind to a Manuel Ugarte own goal just before halftime.\nStaring down the barrel of another home defeat, United upped the ante after the break, getting back on level terms through Diallo eight minutes from time, before the Ivorian completed the turnaround in the 90th minute.\nA stoppage-time third to complete his hat-trick flattered United, who climbed to 12th in the standings with 26 points from 21 games amid another disappointing season, while Southampton stay on six points and remain 10 adrift of the safety zone.\n\"In football you have believe,\" Diallo told TNT Sports. \"Very happy to win this. We know we have quality players but we need some times to be more hungry in the final third. Today we showed at the end we were the best team on the pitch.\"\nWhile there has certainly been recent improvement under new coach Ruben Amorim, United still came into Thursday's encounter looking to avoid a fourth successive home league defeat for the first time since 1934.\nTheir lack of confidence on the ball was apparent in a poor first half showing. Alejandro Garnacho, making his first league start in over a month, sliced one golden chance well wide but otherwise the visitors were creating the best openings.\nA double save from Andre Onana to deny Southampton's lively Tyler Dibling and then Mateus Fernandes from the rebound was the pick of the United goalkeeper’s busy opening period.\nThe hosts looked like they might get to halftime and regroup but Ugarte's misfortune, with the ball going in off his back from a corner, gave the visitors a deserved lead at the break.\nA much-improved United finally started to create more opportunities in the second period, with substitute Antony somehow contriving to miss from close range, but it looked like they would again be frustrated on their own turf.\nThen came Diallo's late intervention.\nThere was an element of fortune about his equaliser, but the 90th minute winner was sublime in its creation from Christian Eriksen and execution before Diallo's first United treble was gift-wrapped by Saints' sloppiness playing out from the back.\nA first United win, in normal time, in seven matches in all competitions was much needed. The performance, however, did little to appease the disgruntled Old Trafford faithful.\nSource: Reuters Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...

    "text": "Le 24 février dernier, une voisine s’était interposée lorsqu’elle avait aperçu l’homme tirant un enfant par le bras. L’homme, âgé de 56 ans, a été condamné pour l’avoir tenu par le poignet.\nPalais de justice (PHOTO D’ILLUSTRATION).\nUn homme de 56 ans, poursuivi pour enlèvement et séquestration à l’encontre d’un enfant de huit ans en pleine rue à Colmar en février, a été relaxé pour ces faits ce jeudi 25 avril par le tribunal correctionnel, mais condamné pour l’avoir tenu par le poignet.\nLe tribunal l’a condamné à une peine de 18 mois de prison avec sursis probatoire, conformément aux réquisitions du parquet.\n“Aucun mal” Selon son récit à l’audience, le quinquagénaire était au niveau des poubelles de son immeuble, pour trier ses déchets, lorsqu’il a rencontré l’enfant et lui aurait parlé, lui indiquant qu’il pourrait lui donner des objets qu’il avait chez lui, s’il l’attendait au rez-de-chaussée.\nMais l’enfant ne l’a pas suivi jusqu’au bout. “Alors je lui ai tiré le poignet”, a reconnu l’homme à la barre, assurant ne lui avoir voulu “aucun mal”.\nLe 24 février, une voisine, qui avait trouvé le comportement de l’homme envers l’enfant étrange, s’était interposée et avait remis l’enfant à sa mère. Cette dernière avait appelé la police, qui a rapidement interpellé le suspect.\n“Cet enfant n’a pas été privé d’aller et venir, il ne s’agit donc pas d’un enlèvement ou d’une séquestration”, a plaidé l’avocate de la défense, Me Christelle Poty, évoquant toutefois “ce geste d’avoir tiré le petit garçon par le poignet, ce qui peut éventuellement être qualifié de violence. À mon sens, rien ne se serait passé si cet homme n’avait pas bu d’alcool”.\nSi la qualification juridique d’enlèvement et séquestration de l’enfant peut être remise en cause, le fait d’avoir agrippé l’enfant “peut parfaitement être qualifié de violence avec deux circonstances aggravantes”, sur un mineur, et par une personne en état d’ivresse, a estimé la substitut du procureur Mélody Barbuti.\nCondamné à 18 mois de prison avec sursis probatoire et l’obligation de soigner son agressivité et son alcoolisme, l’homme est aussi interdit de contact avec des enfants pour une durée de cinq ans.\nIl avait été condamné, en 2020, à une peine de prison ferme pour exhibition sexuelle devant des enfants.",

    "text": "Norway’s biggest pension fund has blacklisted Gulf companies over human rights abuses, including state surveillance and treatment of migrant workers. KLP yesterday said it will boycott firms in the real estate sector in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, where it said migrant workers have faced human rights violations. The fund manager, which has £55billion of assets under management, also targeted Gulf telecoms companies over concerns they have suppressed freedom of expression. It has separately blacklisted Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, citing a lack of green transition planning and its close ties to the Saudi government. It has withdrawn around £12million from the 12 Gulf companies. Human rights abuses: Riyad in Saudi Arabia. Norway's biggest pension fund said it will boycott firms in the real estate sector in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait The Oslo-based pension scheme said investing in Aramco did not align with its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Aramco is 90 per cent state-owned, which has made it ‘difficult for other shareholders to influence the company through the exercise of active ownership’, KLP said. In a statement yesterday the scheme said: ‘Close links between the state and the company result in a significant overall ability to leverage power and influence in favour of a climate and energy transition policy that runs counter to KLP’s goals.’ Aramco has been contacted for comment. The other firms were excluded due to KLP’s concerns about human rights abuses.",
