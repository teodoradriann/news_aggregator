    "title": "Snow Returns Today: 17 Departments Under Yellow Alert on January 2, 2025",
    "text": "A radical shift in climate marks the beginning of 2025, with a cold wave bringing significant temperature drops and snowfall starting January 2nd. Météo France has issued a yellow alert for 17 departments due to snow and ice risks, affecting travel conditions. Snowfall is expected to be light to moderate, particularly in elevated areas, with warnings for icy roads, especially at night. Notable snowfall is anticipated in the Vosges, with accumulation reaching up to 30 centimeters on summits.\nUn hiver précoce en 2025 : La vague de froid s’installe Le début de l’année 2025 est marqué par un changement climatique radical, annonçant l’arrivée de conditions hivernales. Après une période relativement douce, une chute significative des températures et les premières neiges sont attendues à partir de ce jeudi 2 janvier 2025. Une vague de froid s’installe sur le territoire, apportant avec elle les premiers flocons de neige, notamment dans les zones élevées. Toutefois, la situation pourrait se compliquer dans les heures à venir pour plusieurs départements, en particulier ceux situés au nord-est de la France.\nAlerte jaune : 17 départements concernés par la neige et le verglas Météo France a récemment annoncé qu’un total de 17 départements sont placés en alerte jaune en raison des risques de neige et de verglas. Bien que l’alerte jaune soit moins grave que l’alerte orange, elle signale des dangers à ne pas négliger, notamment pour les automobilistes et les piétons. La formation de verglas, surtout le soir et la nuit, pourrait compliquer les déplacements, tout comme les chutes de neige qui pourraient perturber la vie quotidienne de nombreux habitants. Quels départements sont concernés ? Voici la liste complète !\nLes départements sous alerte jaune incluent : Nord, Aisne, Ardennes, Marne, Meuse, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Moselle, Bas-Rhin, Aube, Haute-Marne, Haut-Rhin, Vosges, Côte-d’Or, Haute-Saône, Doubs, Territoire de Belfort et Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.\nSelon les prévisions de Météo France, les chutes de neige resteront légères à modérées, avec un mélange temporaire de flocons et de pluie dans la région parisienne et l’Avesnois, sans accumulation au sol. Cependant, au fur et à mesure que la journée avance, les risques d’ice se développeront, surtout sur les routes secondaires souvent non traitées. Les autorités locales rappellent qu’une vigilance accrue est nécessaire, particulièrement lors des trajets matinaux ou nocturnes, où les températures basses favorisent la formation de plaques glissantes.\nEn détail, Météo France prévoit que la neige remplacera rapidement la pluie de Champagne-Ardenne à Lorraine dans les zones élevées d’ici la fin de la matinée, formant une couche de neige de quelques centimètres à des altitudes de 300 à 400 mètres. Cette situation touchera ensuite la Bourgogne Franche-Comté, mais de manière plus tardive en soirée. Dans les Vosges, attendez-vous à des chutes de neige plus abondantes, avec 7 à 15 centimètres à des altitudes de 800 à 1000 mètres et entre 20 à 30 centimètres sur les sommets !\nDans le nord du Massif Central et des Alpes, la neige arrivera timidement au-dessus de 1200 à 1500 mètres d’altitude, atteignant des régions plus basses durant la nuit, jusqu’à 400-600 mètres. Ces prévisions s’étendent à partir de ce vendredi 3 janvier 2025, alors que la moitié nord du pays est sous alerte jaune. En ce qui concerne les risques d’avalanches, Savoie, Haute-Savoie et Isère sont également sous alerte jaune.",

    "title": "DeMario Douglas injury update: Why Patriots WR is limited in training camp - Pats Pulpit",
    "text": "DeMario Douglas entered training camp as the [New England Patriots](https://www.patspulpit.com/)’ projected No. 1 wide receiver. But while he was present for the first two practice sessions of the summer, his contributions were limited: he did not participate in any team drills on Wednesday and Friday. The reason behind his absence is an apparent injury. According to a [report](https://x.com/PhilAPerry/status/1816524207628730783) by Phil Perry of NBC Sports, the second-year wideout is dealing with a hand issue. Dakota Randall of Pro Football Network [spotted](https://x.com/DakRandall/status/1816523168997343453) him after practice “wearing tape on his left thumb/wrist.” The ailment does not appear to be of the major variety, though. Douglas was not placed on any pre-camp injury lists, and did still participate in warmups and positional work over the first two days. He did not show any further limitations. In his absence from team drills, Ja’Lynn Polk has been given extended opportunities. The second-round draft choice was the first man up in 7-on-7s and 11-on-11s with Douglas unavailable. Douglas, 23, joined the Patriots as a sixth-round selection in the 2023 NFL Draft. He became one of the team’s most prolific playmakers right out of the gate and eventually ended his rookie campaign as New England’s leader in receiving yards. He gained 561 yards on 49 catches, while additionally averaging 5.1 yards on 11 punt returns. He also was forced to miss three total games due to a pair of concussions. Nonetheless, expectations were — and remain — high for Douglas entering Year 2. He and the rest of his Patriots teammates will be back on the practice fields on Friday, 11 a.m. ET.",

    "text": "As the Russia-Ukraine conflict raged in 2022, the United States started \"preparing rigorously\" for a potential nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, in what would have been the first nuclear attack since the US dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly eighty years before, CNN reported citing two senior administration officials.\nPhotograph: ANI Photo However, the report stated that outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries played an important role in averting the crisis.\nThe Biden administration was specifically concerned Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said.\nAmid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, as reported by CNN .\n\"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\" the senior administration official said.\nUS officials say that outreach and public statements from Modi and others helped avert a crisis.\n\"I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,\" CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying.\n \"I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,\" the senior administration official added. \"I can't demonstrate this positively, but I think that's our assessment.\"\nRegarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\nIn a major statement, Modi told President Putin that \"this is not the era of war\" on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year.\nThe statement even made to the G20 communique under the presidency of India.\nDuring this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place \"in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it or deter it,\" the senior administration official said.\nNotably, late summer 2022 was also proving a 'devastating period' for Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were advancing on Russian-occupied Kherson in the south, the city which had been Russia's biggest prize since the invasion.\nAs these Ukrainian forces advanced, entire Russian units were in danger of being surrounded. The view inside the administration was that such a catastrophic loss could be a \"potential trigger\" for the use of nuclear weapons, according to CNN.\nAlso, at the same time, Russia was allegedly circulating a new \"false flag story\" about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which US officials feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack.\nIn October 2022, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was \"concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.\"\nBut, it is pertinent to note that at no time did the US detect intelligence indicating Russia was taking steps to mobilize its nuclear forces to carry out such an attack, CNN reported.\n\"We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,\" a senior administration official said. \"And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would've expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.\"",

    "text": "Guwahati, December 29: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has apologised for uploading a post with casteist remarks on his social media platforms saying that his team made an &quot;incorrect translation&quot; of a verse from the Bhagavad Gita. Sarma in a post on X and Facebook on Thursday night said that he uploads one verse of Bhagavad Gita every morning on his social media handles, which have posted 668 Slokas till date. &quot;Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation. As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post... If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologise,&quot; he said. ‘Assam Picture of Casteless Society’: Himanta Biswa Sarma Apologises For Incorrect Translation of Bhagavad Gita Verse. The chief minister stressed that Assam reflects a &quot;perfect picture&quot; of a casteless society due to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva. On December 26, Sarma had uploaded an audio-visual post on his social media handles like X and Facebook that he claimed to be from Sloka 44 of Sanyas Yoga from the 18th chapter of Gita. Assam Govt Announces Vacancies for Over 10,000 Posts in Education Department; CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Says, &#039;Will Exceed Promise of Creating More Than 1 Lakh Government Jobs&#039;. The animated video stated that &quot;farming, cow-rearing and commerce are habitual and natural duties of the Vaishya, while serving the three &#039;varnas&#039; -- Brahman, Kshatriya and Vaishya -- is the natural duty of the Shudras.&quot; Sharing this video, Sarma even said: &quot;God Sri Krishna himself described the types of natural duties of Vaishya and Shudras.&quot; This sparked a massive political row with opposition leaders denouncing what they called the &quot;BJP&#039;s Manuvadi and regressive ideology&quot;. Facing a volley of criticism, Sarma later deleted the post from all his social media platforms.",

    "title": "A Wake-Up Call Motivated Matthew to Change His Lifestyle - Thrive Global",
    "text": "My mom had a massive heart attack, and it was scary. It was a wake-up call that motivated me to change my lifestyle. She had high cholesterol. I also had very high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I’m 39, I weighed 254 pounds, and I really wanted to lose weight and get healthy. I was in a lot of pain — my knees hurt a lot and I didn’t feel good about myself. I downloaded the Thrive app and started to make changes with Microsteps. I began making healthy food choices. The hardest obstacle for me was staying motivated every day. But I overcame that by focusing on my goals. I eat a lot of protein, like hamburger meat and eggs. For lunch, I’ll have a hamburger or chicken breast, and for dinner I’m eating mainly grilled chicken and broccoli. Also, cooking at home instead of eating out is helping me save money. A Microstep that’s really helping me is moving my body every day. I walk on my treadmill in the morning before work and I exercise again at home after work. I use dumbbells and I’ll do push ups. And three days a week I go to the gym. I listen to country and rock music while I work out. Once I was moving every day, I started to feel better, and now I feel great. I have a lot more energy. Work has improved because it’s easier to move around. I’m in a better mood. I watch Thrive Reset videos to stay calm and relaxed. And I watch classes that are offered on the app. The thing that helped the most was the checklist reminding me to complete my Microsteps every day. That gave me a sense of accomplishment and the motivation to keep on going. My sleep is better. I set a night time schedule. I go to bed at the same time every night and I put my electronics away an hour before bedtime. I get the rest I need and wake up ready for the day. To relax, I love to go fishing — I go anytime the weather permits. I love to fish at Lake Waco and the Brazos river. I like to hang out with friends and family. We have group gatherings to watch sports and play games. I’ve lost 40 pounds and I feel much more confident and less stressed since my weight loss. My Thrive journey has been life-changing. I went to the doctor the other day and I weighed 214 pounds. I was very happy when I saw that number. I haven’t felt this good in a long time.” — Matthew Howard, Distribution Center #9153, Waco, TX; $5K Winner",
