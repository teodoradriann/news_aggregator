    "text": "I find it amusing that Republicans have recently been falling over themselves to support Israel and condemn antisemitism. But this stance is purely opportunistic and entirely hypocritical.\nInnumerable Republican politicians have invoked the name of billionaire philanthropist George Soros as a proxy for the evil Jewish puppet master who secretly controls world events.\nDonald Trump insisted that some of the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville during the Unite the Right rally were \"very fine people.\"\nNumerous Republican politicians have referred to the Great Replacement Theory in their speeches and comments. This is the idea that Jews are plotting to flood the country with swarthy immigrants in order to subjugate white, Christian Americans within a secular, liberal society. These sentiments have inspired mass shooters around the world to massacre Jews, immigrants and nonwhite citizens.\nPeople are also reading…\nTerms like \"globalists\" and \"cosmopolitans\" have been bandied about by certain rightwing politicians and news commentators. These are widely understood to be antisemitic dog whistles informing us that greedy Jews are undermining the country in order to enrich themselves.\nDonald Trump, Representatives Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene and several other Republican politicians have associated themselves with Holocaust denier and Jew-hater Nick Fuentes.\nMost Republican politicians have allied themselves with evangelical Christians who claim to love Israel. But evangelicals largely see Israel as a necessary player in their end times pageant, when Armageddon ensues, Jesus returns, and Jews will either convert or be cast into a lake of fire.\nMike Diamond Rock Island",

    "title": "Teachings in Bodhgaya – First Day",
    "text": "Bodhgaya, Bihar, India - A pall of chilly mist lay over Bodhgaya this morning as His Holiness the Dalai Lama took the short drive from Gaden Phelgyeling, the Tibetan Monastery, to the Kalachakra Ground. The street was lined by smiling well-wishers including drummers from Ladakh. His Holiness waved to them as he passed.\nJust inside the gate to the teaching ground His Holiness paused before a new stone statue of the Buddha commissioned by the Bodhgaya Temple Management Committee (BTMG). Members of the committee we there to welcome him. Supported by monks from Namgyal Monastery His Holiness chanted verses to consecrate the image, their recitations punctuated by tossing handfuls of flower petals into the air by way of blessing.\nHis Holiness was able to disembark from the golf cart right at the edge of the stage in front of the throne, from where he waved to the 50,000 strong crowd, that included approximately 15,000 from more than 50 countries, to the right, the left and straight ahead. Turning around he saluted the statue of the Buddha behind the throne. He greeted Sakya Gongma Rinpoché, Sakya Trizin and other members of the Sakya family. On the opposite side he greeted Ganden Tri Rinpoché and Jangtsé Chöjé Rinpoché, as well as the Speaker of the Tibetan Parliament and the Sikyong Penpa Tsering.\nOnce His Holiness had taken his seat a group of Theravadin monks gathered before him to chant the ‘Mangala Sutta’ in Pali. This was followed by a lilting recitation of the ‘Heart Sutra’ and a mandala offering in Tibetan. Meanwhile tea and bread were served.\n“Whatever kind of discourse is being given,” His Holiness began, addressing the crowd, “it’s important that we first check our motivation. This applies to both the teacher and the taught. We should avoid the eight worldly concerns. The teacher should neither be selfish nor only in search of peace. Disciples should not be absorbed by the pleasures of this life. All should seek to benefit others.\n“We’ll recite the verse for taking refuge and cultivating the awakening mind of bodhichitta. The Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are the objects of refuge and the reason we turn to them is to attain unsurpassable enlightenment in order to be able to lead all sentient beings to liberation.\n“Having met with the teaching of Buddha Shakyamuni, it’s good to recognise that whatever he taught was rooted in his own experience. He had overcome all mental afflictions and the obstructions to knowledge that are their residue. As is written in the ‘Sublime Continuum’ (Uttaratantra), all sentient beings have the potential to attain Buddhahood, but their minds are shrouded in defilements.\n“Since the defilements are not of the same nature as the mind, they can be eliminated and the intrinsic, luminous, clear light nature of the mind can be made manifest. This means that we can achieve the omniscient state that the Buddha has reached.\n“Defilements leave residual stains that function as obstructions to knowledge, but they too can be overcome. Because the nature of the mind is clear light, it is stainless by nature. It is by purifying our minds that we can achieve the same state as the Buddha. And it is possible to purify our minds because the various defilements are adventitious and temporary, while the intrinsic nature of the mind is clear and knowing. It is clear light.\n“From my own experience, having reflected long on the awakening mind of bodhichitta and the wisdom understanding emptiness—method and wisdom—I infer that mental defilements are only temporary. They do not obscure our minds forever. Although I have not developed single-pointed concentration, I think that of the five-fold path I can achieve the path of preparation.\n“The antidotes to our mental defilements and obstructions to knowledge are two—bodhichitta and an understanding of emptiness. It we develop these we can achieve Buddhahood as Shakyamuni has done. We can cultivate the courage and determination to do so because the basic nature of the Buddha’s mind and our minds is the same. The mind we have now will ultimately become the mind of a Buddha.”\nHis Holiness remarked that Vasubandhu declared the Buddha’s teaching to have two aspects, one consisting of scriptures and the other comprising realization. He added that we will not gain realization or overcome defilements and obscurations just on the basis of words. Having learned what the teaching means, we must apply it within. Then, whatever we may be doing, we’ll be able to see how the mind’s defilements can be reduced and eliminated. His Holiness reiterated that it is the clear light nature of the mind that makes it possible for us to overcome defilements and manifest the omniscient state of a Buddha.\nThrough the practice of bodhichitta we can fulfil our own goals as well as the goals of others. Therefore, we pledge to generate the awakening mind. Having cultivated this aspiration to enlightenment, we determine to work for the benefit of all sentient beings.\nHis Holiness announced, “Today, the teaching is focussed on ‘In Praise of the Dharmdhatu’ by Nagarjuna. The text begins with homage to the dharmadhatu that is the Buddha nature that abides in every sentient being. But because they aren't aware of it, they spin through the cycle of existence. However, when what gives rise to the cycle of existence is purified, it becomes nirvana and likewise, dharmakaya, the Truth Body of a Buddha. The empty nature of the Buddha’s mind and our minds is just the same. We can have confidence that because dharmadhatu is stainless, it is possible to attain the Dharmakaya.\n“We regard things as having independent existence, which is to cling to ignorance. We must recall instead that the nature of the mind is empty, and things are merely designated. As long as the clear light nature of the mind is shrouded in defilements, we remain sentient beings. When they are removed, we become enlightened.”\nHis Holiness mentioned that of the five obscurations mentioned in verse 19 he has amended the name of the first from desire to regret. He repeated that when we can understand that defilements are temporary and that there are antidotes to them, we will appreciate that it is possible to attain enlightenment. Although the three poisons, desire, anger and ignorance are powerful, they can be overcome. We must be confident we can achieve this goal.\n“We’ve gathered here in this sacred location where enlightenment took place,” His Holiness observed, “and we’ve gone through this text ‘In Praise of Dharmadhatu’. On my part, I do my best to cultivate the awakening mind of bodhichitta and an understanding of emptiness every day, not with a view to this life alone, but, as the famous verse says, ‘as long as space remains’. I urge you my Dharma friends to do the same as best you can.”\nA thanksgiving mandala was offered followed by a recitation of the Words of Truth, composed by His Holiness. The session concluded with the following prayer:\nMay the operation of evil thoughts and negative deeds among human and non-human beings\nWho harbour malice through their perverted prayers\nAgainst the teaching of the Victorious One\nBe totally vanquished by the power of truth of the Three Jewels.",

    "text": "2024-11-06 02:00:00\nSi la peau a besoin d’hydratation, elle doit lui apporter un regain de fraîcheur : les sérums pour le visage font partie de la routine de soins quotidienne de nombreuses personnes depuis plusieurs années. Est-ce justifié ou peut-on se passer des produits souvent aqueux de type gel ? Notre magazine partenaire suisse Saldo a testé dix sérums pour le visage, parmi lesquels des produits de marques discount et classiques ainsi que des cosmétiques naturels certifiés. Les meilleurs prennent réellement bien soin de la peau. Trois d’entre eux sont également disponibles en Allemagne.\nTarifs de 5 à 28 euros le pack Afin de déterminer dans quelle mesure les produits enrichissent la peau en hydratation, les Suisses ont demandé à des sujets de test d’utiliser les sérums. Ils ont ensuite utilisé un appareil de mesure spécial – le cornéomètre – pour déterminer la teneur en eau de la couche cornée de la peau. Parmi les sérums qui ont donné les meilleurs résultats lors de ce test, nous avons également ces trois :\nLe sérum Lacura Skin Expert Vitamin C + Aha d’Aldi, bon marché, coûte un peu moins de 5 euros par paquet de 30 millilitres. Dans la boutique en ligne, le discounter propose le sérum en pack de trois pour environ 15 euros. Le sérum Hydro Refresh de Lavera est disponible en cosmétique naturel certifié pour environ 13,20 euros les 30 millilitres. Le Concentré Firming Builder de Weleda, qui coûte environ 28 euros le paquet de 30 millilitres, est également un produit cosmétique naturel certifié. Selon le fournisseur, il a désormais été retiré de la gamme, les stocks restants sont toujours en vente. En hiver, utilisez un sérum le soir et une crème le jour Par temps glacial, il faut utiliser des produits cosmétiques hydratants comme des sérums, surtout le soir avant de se coucher. En revanche, pendant la journée à l’air frais, les crèmes plus riches sont plus utiles : elles créent un fin film de graisse sur la peau qui ne gèle pas, mais peut protéger la peau d’un dessèchement supplémentaire.\nPendant la saison chaude, en particulier pour les peaux grasses et mixtes, un seul sérum suffit parfois pendant la journée. De nombreux utilisateurs combinent sérums et crèmes. Après avoir nettoyé le visage, il faut d’abord appliquer le sérum, puis la crème. Lors des journées ensoleillées, il est conseillé d’utiliser également un protecteur UV pour protéger la peau des dommages.\nAstuce : Dans notre test de 14 crèmes pour le visage pour peaux sèches, les discounters et les produits de marque coûteux se sont également affrontés. Comme pour les sérums, il est apparu que les prix ne disent souvent rien de la qualité des produits cosmétiques.\n#Sérums #pour #visage #désaltérants #pour #peau\n1731014647",

    "text": "The Brief Cook County is rolling out a public awareness campaign to reduce stigma and encourage people to seek mental health support. The initiative includes expanded access to a mental health helpline and peer-support groups. A new $12.1 million clinic in Bronzeville is now part of a network of 14 county-run facilities. COOK COUNTY - Cook County is expanding mental health support through a new awareness campaign and more accessible services, including a new clinic in Bronzeville.\nWhat we know:\nMental health support in Cook County is getting a significant boost with the launch of a countywide public awareness campaign aimed at breaking stigma and helping residents connect to care.\nThe initiative includes improved access to a mental health helpline run by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), which provides emotional support and referrals to mental health resources. It also supports the growth of community-based peer-support groups.\nJasmine Watkins of NAMI Chicago said the goal is to make it easier for people to take the first step toward mental health care.\n\"We strongly believe that no one should have to struggle alone, which is why we’re so deeply committed to making sure that it’s easy for people to reach out and ask for help when they’re not sure what they need or where to go,\" Watkins said.\nDig deeper:\nCook County Health is also celebrating the opening of a new family medicine clinic in Bronzeville. The $12.1 million facility, located in the former Lake Meadows Professional Building on East 31st Street, is an extension of Provident Hospital in Washington Park.\nThe new Bronzeville clinic joins a network of 14 county-run facilities in the Chicago area, all of which provide services regardless of a patient’s ability to pay.\nThe Source: The information in this article was obtained from Cook County Health and NAMI Chicago.",

[Roadside Assistance via Satellite](https://www.idropnews.com/news/heres-what-the-iphones-roadside-assistance-via-satellite-looks-like-in-action/203016/) allows iPhone users to contact road assistance services in areas where cellular or Wi-Fi is unavailable. To connect to a satellite (on an iPhone 14 or later, running iOS 17 or later), you’ll need to be outside and have a clear view of the sky and horizon. UK breakdown rescue service Green Flag has partnered with Apple to provide assistance to stranded motorists via the feature. The service is available on a pay-per-use basis for users who are not Green Flag members, although specific pricing details have not yet been announced. Apple’s satellite services, including Roadside Assistance, are free for the first two years with the purchase of a new iPhone 14 or later model. Apple already offers Roadside Assistance via Satellite in the United States, thanks to partnerships with AAA and [Verizon Roadside Assistance](https://www.idropnews.com/news/you-can-now-get-apples-roadside-assistance-from-verizon-via-satellite/204235/). How To Request Roadside Assistance via Satellite in the Messages App Here’s how to use the feature: - Open the Messages app and start a new message. - Type “roadside” into the address field. (When you’re off the grid with no mobile and Wi-Fi coverage, you’ll see the option to request Roadside Assistance via satellite.) - You’ll see a “Roadside Assistance” option appear. - Tap on Roadside Assistance. - Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to a satellite and request assistance. How To Request Roadside Assistance via Satellite Through Connection Assistant To use Connection Assistant to access satellite features, you’ll need to have iOS 18 or later installed on your iPhone. To use the feature, do one of the following: Open Connection Assistant - Swipe down from the top right corner of your iPhone’s screen to open Control Center. - Tap the Mobile Data button on the right (it looks like an antenna giving off radio waves) - Tap Satellite. - Follow the onscreen instructions to connect to a satellite. - Choose Roadside Assistance to request help for your vehicle. Please keep in mind that if you do have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection, the Satellite option will not appear. Tapping the Satellite button in Control Center will open the Satellite Connection Demo. Things to Keep in Mind When Using Roadside Assistance via Satellite - An iPhone 14 or later (any model) is required - Your iPhone must have iOS 17 or later installed to connect to AAA for roadside assistance in the United States, or iOS 17.2 or later and a Verizon SIM installed in your iPhone to connect to Verizon for roadside assistance. - In the United Kingdom, your iPhone 14 or later must have iOS 17 or later installed to connect to Green Flag for roadside assistance. - You will need to be in a location that does not have mobile or Wi-Fi coverage. - You will need to connect to a satellite with your iPhone - You must have an active SIM installed in your iPhone. Roadside Assistance via satellite is currently available only in the United States (including Puerto Rico) and the United Kingdom. Roadside service providers may not support all states or territories. International travelers visiting the US or UK can use the feature while visiting as long as their iPhone has the necessary hardware; phones purchased in Armenia, Belarus, mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia lack satellite connectivity features.",

    "title": "Barrick Gold refuta alegações do governo do Mali Por Investing.com",
    "text": "TORONTO - A Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD)(TSX:ABX) negou publicamente as alegações do Ministério das Minas e do Ministério das Finanças do Mali, afirmando que não deixou de cumprir seus compromissos sob um acordo com o governo. A disputa centra-se na distribuição dos benefícios do complexo de mineração Loulo-Gounkoto.\nRecentemente, em 30.09.2023, a Barrick anunciou uma estrutura para negociações com o governo do Mali visando uma resolução abrangente de suas divergências. Desde então, a empresa tem se envolvido ativamente com o governo. Um memorando de acordo está em andamento, que detalhará os termos da resolução e delineará os princípios futuros de parceria, incluindo o aumento dos benefícios econômicos do estado provenientes do complexo de mineração.\nNo início de outubro, a Barrick fez um pagamento significativo de 50 bilhões de FCFA (85 milhões de dólares) ao governo do Mali como parte dessas negociações em curso. Apesar de rejeitar qualquer irregularidade, a Barrick expressou seu compromisso de trabalhar de boa-fé com o Mali, onde opera há 30 anos.\nMark Bristow, Presidente e CEO da Barrick, enfatizou o relacionamento de longa data da empresa com o Mali e seu histórico de resolver amigavelmente diferenças passadas. A empresa continua focada em alcançar uma solução mutuamente aceitável para o atual impasse em benefício de todas as partes envolvidas.\nO comunicado de imprensa também continha declarações prospectivas sobre as negociações em curso e os possíveis resultados, incluindo a possibilidade de aumentar a participação do governo nos benefícios econômicos das operações de mineração. No entanto, os leitores são advertidos de que essas declarações não são garantias de desempenho futuro e estão sujeitas a vários riscos e incertezas.\nEsta notícia é baseada em um comunicado de imprensa da Barrick Gold Corporation.\nEm outras notícias recentes, a Barrick Gold Corporation projeta um aumento de 30% na produção de onças equivalentes de ouro de seus ativos atuais até o final desta década. A estratégia de crescimento da empresa deriva da aquisição de ativos de alta qualidade através da fusão com a Randgold, que não exigiu compra com ágio. Em Nevada, a Barrick iniciou operações em Goldrush, visando uma produção anual de 400.000 onças até 2028. Two grandes projetos de cobre, o projeto Reko Diq no Paquistão e o projeto Lumwana Super Pit na Zâmbia, devem iniciar a produção em 2028, esperando-se que impulsionem o negócio de cobre da empresa. O sucesso da Barrick na reposição de reservas também foi observado, tendo a empresa reposto mais reservas de ouro do que extraiu nos últimos cinco anos. Estes são desenvolvimentos recentes que destacam o foco da empresa no crescimento orgânico e na criação de valor a partir de seu portfólio existente. No entanto, é importante notar que as perspectivas e projeções de crescimento da empresa estão sujeitas a mudanças, com base em vários fatores como condições de mercado e desempenho operacional.\nInsights do InvestingPro\nEnquanto a Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) navega em suas negociações com o governo do Mali, os investidores podem achar valiosos contextos adicionais de dados financeiros recentes e insights de analistas. De acordo com o InvestingPro, a capitalização de mercado da Barrick é de 35,52 bilhões de dólares, refletindo sua presença significativa na indústria de mineração de ouro.\nA saúde financeira da empresa parece robusta, com as Dicas do InvestingPro indicando que os ativos líquidos da Barrick excedem suas obrigações de curto prazo, e ela opera com um nível moderado de dívida. Esta estabilidade financeira poderia proporcionar à Barrick flexibilidade enquanto trabalha para resolver a situação no Mali.\nA receita da Barrick nos últimos doze meses até o segundo trimestre de 2023 foi de 11,83 bilhões de dólares, com uma taxa de crescimento de 9,77%. Este crescimento, juntamente com um forte crescimento do EBITDA de 19,43% no mesmo período, sugere que as operações da empresa permanecem produtivas apesar dos desafios geopolíticos.\nOs investidores também podem observar que a Barrick está negociando perto de sua máxima de 52 semanas, com um preço que é 98,27% de seu pico. Isso pode indicar confiança do mercado na capacidade da empresa de gerenciar efetivamente suas operações internacionais, incluindo a situação atual no Mali.\nPara aqueles que buscam uma compreensão mais profunda da posição financeira e perspectivas futuras da Barrick, o InvestingPro oferece 8 dicas adicionais, que podem fornecer insights valiosos sobre o desempenho da empresa em meio às suas negociações atuais e operações globais.\nEssa notícia foi traduzida com a ajuda de inteligência artificial.
