    "text": "By Ismael Lopez\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) - Nicaraguan police detained on Thursday two senior Catholic priests who are close to the country's top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising to at least six the number of clergymen detained this week.\nThe source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio, and noted that their arrest brings to at least six the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released.\nThe government's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOver the past few years, Ortega's government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes.\nAviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer.\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticized the government's deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018, and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year.\nLast week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez's detention in 2022.\nMany of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests' alleged crimes.\nNicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released.\n\"I ask God to protect them and that they be freed immediately!\" wrote in a post on X on Thursday.\nAccording to exiled Nicaraguan researcher Martha Patricia Molina, who publishes records of what she describes as the persecution of the Catholic Church under Ortega, the number of bishops, priests and seminarians behind bars in the country currently stands at nine.\n(Reporting by Ismael Lopez; Writing by David Alire Garcia and Miral Fahmy)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Nicaragua , crime , Costa Rica\nRead More",

    "title": "Without having jurisdiction and without showing the minutes, the Supreme Court declares victory for Nicolás Maduro: why does this deepen the crisis in Venezuela?",
    "text": "Without showing the voting minutes of July 28 or the evaluated material he Supreme Court of Justice of Venezuela ( TSJ) ratified that Nicolas Maduro won the presidential elections, thus validating the announcement by the National Electoral Council (CNE), which almost a month later has also not released the results.\nAccording to the criteria of Venezuelans knew in advance what the high court’s ruling would be, which, legally, does not have the authority to make such a ruling because, as part of the judicial branch, it would be taking the place of the electoral power represented by the CNE. Which makes clear once again the lack of separation of powers in Venezuela.\nThe dean of the Faculty of Political and Legal Sciences of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), Juan Carlos Apitz had already warned that any sentence would be void “because they (the court) are not competent to hear such proceedings (…) This sentence is non-existent in the legal world, lawyers say ‘it is absolutely void’,” he told La Voz de América.\nAptiz had already warned in an interview with EL TIEMPO that it would be almost unthinkable for Chavismo to hand over power, even though the election results would give victory to the opposition.\nThey are not competent to hear this procedure (…) This sentence is non-existent in the legal world, we lawyers say ‘it is absolutely null and void’\nThe Court “certifies in an unobjectionable manner the electoral material examined and this chamber validates the results of the presidential election of July 28, 2024, issued by the National Electoral Council, where citizen Nicolás Maduro Moros was elected president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the constitutional period 2025-2031. Thus it is decided,” read the sentence read by Caryslia Rodríguez, president of the highest court and member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV).\nThis decision did not surprise anyone. Maria Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonzalez, the opposition leader and presidential candidate, respectively, had already warned about it on Wednesday and described it as a “judicial maneuver” that they would not accept.\nNicolás Maduro and the opposition, led by Corina Machado and Edmundo González.\nPhoto: EFE\nShare\nOn the other hand, The United Nations had also warned about what was coming . “The Fact-Finding Mission on this country (Venezuela) warns about the lack of independence and impartiality of both institutions (TSJ and CNE).\nThis plot only deepens the political crisis in Venezuela. For the former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles The TSJ’s position “reaffirms the very serious institutional situation that deepens the distrust of the vast majority of Venezuelans in the justice administration system.”\nBut on the international level, the Maduro government is once again heading towards a spiral of rejection and isolation, which had been avoided for the moment by the mediation of the presidents of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, and of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva who have been silent for over a week in view of the Chavistas’ refusal to accept their defeat and the lack of acceptance of their suggestion to repeat elections or install a coalition regime.\nInternational reactions to the announcement Reactions were not long in coming. The president of Uruguay, Luis Lacalle Pou, said that the TSJ ruling “confirms the fraud” of Maduro. Gabriel Boric of Chile, called the TSJ ruling “infamy” and accused Maduro of having “assassinated democracy” (see alternate note). On the other hand, US senators urged President Joe Biden to “deny visa applications to dictators Díaz-Canel and Maduro” to attend the UN General Assembly. The US ambassador to Guyana also asked Caricom to support “democracy” in Venezuela. For its part, the UN said it was willing to mediate if there is agreement and request from all parties: “Our good offices are always available.”\nBut none of this seems to matter to Chavismo, which controls all institutions, including the National Armed Forces, which declared itself in favor of “complying with” the court ruling.\nCNE President Elvis Amoroso shaking hands with Venezuelan Supreme Court (TSJ) President Caryslia Rodríguez.\nPhoto: AFP\nShare\nAll this leads to a crossroads for the opposition, as well as a new path of persecution, already announced by the TSJ itself, as its president asked the attorney general, Tarek William Saab, to determine those responsible for usurping functions, as well as for “forging” the minutes uploaded to the website resultadosconvzla.com.\nBesides, The TSJ declared González in contempt for his refusal to attend the expert hearings and announced that it will forward his sentence to the Attorney General in the face of “sanctions.” González argued that he was absent because he was “absolutely vulnerable due to defenselessness.”\nAdded to this are the new threats from the Speaker of Parliament, Jorge Rodriguez. “Whoever does not abide by the ruling of the TSJ is outside the democratic game (…) Whoever does not abide by this ruling, should not come later to register a list of deputies or register candidates for governorships and mayorships.” He is referring to the regional elections next year.\nGonzález Urrutia, recognized as the winner of the elections, sent a message through X, in which he insisted that no ruling will replace popular sovereignty. “The country and the world know of your partiality and, therefore, your inability to resolve the conflict; your decision will only aggravate the crisis. We Venezuelans are not willing to give up our freedom or our right to change in peace in order to live better.”\nFor human rights defender Enrique Ochoa Antich, the opposition has two options: the first is to reject it and continue playing by the State’s rules; or not to abide by it and return “to the path of forced change.”\n#jurisdiction #showing #minutes #Supreme #Court #declares #victory #Nicolás #Maduro #deepen #crisis #Venezuela",

    "text": "WILLIAMSBURG, NEW YORK -- Bushwick Grind in Williamsburg is a café that tackles social issues. In 2015, Kymme Williams-Davis and her husband Raymond Davis saw a need to create a business that offered a welcoming environment. Their café fosters community with alternatives to the fast-food options in the surrounding area.\nTwo years prior to the\nBushwick Grind's opening, Williams-Davis learned of the lack of equity in the coffee field. According to Fairtrade International, farmers received low compensation for their coffee beans, producers, on average, retaining one percent of the retail coffee price, prompting an increase in the fairtrade minimum price for coffee. A coffee producer would make around $0.04 USD per each $4 USD cup of coffee. According to the National Coffee Association USA, women contribute 40-80% of the labor in the coffee industry. Williams-Davis has pledged to work with roasters and distributors that are actively working to invest in the communities from which they source their coffee. She currently imports house espresso from Yirga Chefe, Ethiopia, where she works directly with a single farmer; the rest of the café' s coffee is sourced locally.\nIn addition to ethical sourcing, the Bushwick Grind works to improve food insecurity in their community with their\nTwo Fish, Five Loaves community fridge. According to local estimates, one in every five Bushwick residents experienced food insecurity. Briana Calderon Navarro of Collective Focus, LLC speaks on the increase in community fridges in New York City, stating that \"because the pandemic was such an abnormal time, for most of us, we were able to think creatively about what a solution could look like for our communities...dozens, if not hundreds of people all over New York City...decided to put refrigerators out on the sidewalks.\" The fridge operates on donations from organizations like Collective Focus, supermarkets, and Bushwick Grind. Donations like canned goods and feminine hygiene products are placed directly into the fridge and passersby take what they need daily.\nVisit the Bushwick Grind at 63 Whipple St, Brooklyn, NY, 11206",

    "text": "Tariq Simons grateful for first coaching experience Tariq Simons enjoyed his first assignment as a national coach when he took charge of Bermuda’s under-14 team at the ITF World Junior Competition in El Salvador. On his return to the country where he made his Junior Davis Cup debut in 2017, Simons guided Bermuda to thirteenth place out of 17 teams at the pre-qualifying event for the North, Central American and Caribbean region. The team was made up of Dexter Snaith, Jaden Jones and Chase McCrimmon. Bermuda found the going tough, with losses to Guatemala and Puerto Rico eliminating them from the main draw, but they went on to overcome the Dominican Republic and Suriname in the play-off stages. Simons, 23, had been working with the players at Manders Tennis Management before Snaith left for the US and was grateful for the experience. “It was really good for the overall outlook of my career,’’ Simons said. “Doing something like coaching the under-14s national team with the boys that I coach is a privilege because I have a relationship with the boys already. “A lot of coaches from other nations might be coaching children they see a few times a year. These players that I took were my boys, they’re at MTM several days a week and we’re more like family. “In terms of energy, it’s seamless and we have this vibe that we carry as a team. When we travel and when we play on court, it’s just a pleasant experience.” Simons gave an honest assessment of the players and also shared his thoughts on Guatemala and Puerto Rico, the two teams they faced in group B. “The boys that I took were on the middle side of competitors,’’ Simons said. “They were good enough and they were solid enough players to compete with everybody and we could have beaten half the teams if we played them. “Guatemala and Puerto Rico were just strong teams and they really played well. My boys competed really well and we were able to compete but not enough to win those matches. “When we went into the back draw for the teams to know their final placement, we won all of our matches and it was good to win those. We were looking for a win throughout the week and we got it on the third day that we played. “We were confident going into those matches. The real challenge was the teams we played in the first stage but after that we were pretty comfortable with teams because we knew all of them. “We knew who the best in the competition were. We saw the teams that we were getting after, and the boys went in confident that we were going to win and we did it.” Need to Know [How do I clear my cache and cookies?](https://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=32050) 2.

    "text": "“Il a trop longtemps été soutenu par le monde du cinéma”: Sophie Marceau réagit à la tribune en soutien à Depardieu\nSophie Marceau réagit à la tribune en soutien à Gérard Depardieu, accusé d’agressions sexuelles par 14 femmes. Cette tribune appelée “N’effacez pas Depardieu” et publiée ce lundi soir sur le site du Figaro, a été signée par une cinquantaine de personnalités du monde du cinéma, mais aussi de la musique française. Celle-ci est une réaction au reportage “Complément d’enquête” sur France 2, où l’acteur y multiplie les insultes misogynes et où il n’épargne pas de ses commentaires sexuels une fillette de 10 ans.\n“Une attitude grossière et déplacée”\nIl y a quelques années, Sophie Marceau dénonçait déjà le comportement de Gérard Depardieu qu’elle qualifiait de prédateur. Elle réagit à nouveau dans Paris Match où elle répète ce qu’elle a toujours pensé de l’acteur. “Il a une attitude grossière et déplacée”, indique l’actrice française, qui ne mâche pas ses mots. Elle ajoute : “La vulgarité et la provocation ont toujours été son fonds de commerce”. Elle explique également que Gérard Depardieu a “trop longtemps été soutenu par le monde du cinéma. Tout le monde l’applaudissait et trouvait ça normal. Sauf que maintenant, les femmes parlent”.\nL’actrice décrit la façon de faire de l’acteur : “Il s’en prend d’abord aux petites assistantes et ne s’en prend jamais aux grandes actrices”. Une position qu’elle maintient depuis des années, car Sophie Marceau refuse de tourner avec lui. Elle conclut son interview pour Paris Match avec ceci : “On l’accuse aujourd’hui de pourquoi on l’a encensé, je ne vais pas lui tendre la perche, ni l’enterrer “.\nEn 2015, Sophie Marceau le qualifiait déjà de prédateur, mais ses propos n’avaient pas eu la même portée que maintenant.",

    "text": "The Department of Health and Human Services plans to slash 10,000 employees in a major restructuring of the whole department, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Thursday.\nWhen combined with other efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency to downsize, the workforce will be reduced from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees.\n“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said in a statement. “This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”\nKennedy said the restructuring involves eliminating “an entire alphabet soup of departments” while streamlining others.\nMajor changes include combining many offices into more centralized ones, HHS announced. HHS plans to create the Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) will be subsumed into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHHS’s many divisions will be consolidated and administrative functions across these divisions like human resources and IT will be centralized. Twenty-eight divisions will be consolidated to 15.\nTen regional offices will be consolidated to five. At the FDA, one of the least trusted agencies within HHS, 3,500 full-time employees will be cut in operations and administration.\nHHS said the move will not affect drug, medical device, or food reviewers or inspectors. NIH will combine administrative employees across its 27 institutes and centers — leading to approximately 1,200 positions being cut.\nCDC will reduce its workforce by 2,400 employees, which will be offset by approximately 1,000 employees from ASPR moving into CDC.\nThe division of labor between the many offices under HHS stoked confusion and inefficiencies during COVID-19 pandemic.\nHHS grew considerably during the pandemic. The Food and Drug Administration grew by 13%, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew by 26% and the National Institutes of Health grew by 34% under Biden, according to trade publication Government Executive.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

La conferencia también se centrará en temas clave como \"Tecnología Verde, Familia y Conectividad\", pilares que resuenan con las expectativas de los usuarios peruanos.

    "text": "The Assam government has scrapped the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935 in a big step towards the implementation of UCC. Guwahati: The Assam cabinet, chaired by state Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, on Friday decided to repeal the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935. Assam Minister Jayanta Malla Baruah, while announcing this during a media briefing, stated it to be a very important step in a journey towards the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in the state. Baruah said that a total of 94 Muslim registrars were still doing registration and divorce of Muslim marriages in Assam based on the act. “Towards a journey to the UCC, the Assam cabinet has decided to repeal the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935 with immediate effect. As many as 94 Muslim registrars were still doing registration and divorce of Muslim marriages on the basis of this age-old act which was prevalent since the British rule in India, but from now onwards, no marriage or divorce will happen through it as it has been repealed,” Baruah said. Baruah said that with the abolition of this act, all marriages in Assam will now happen under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. “From today, the District Commissioners (DCs) of Assam will take custody of the 94 Muslim registrars who were operating under the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, and the state government will provide them with a one-time compensation of Rs two lakh each for their livelihood,” Baruah added. Baruah further said that with the decision of the Assam cabinet to repeal the act, the menace of child marriages in the state will be eradicated. “Under the act, we used to see underage marriages with grooms below 21 years and brides below 18 years happening, but now, child marriages will be completely eradicated,” Baruah said. In a midnight post on X, Assam Chief Minister Sarma wrote, “On 23.2.2024, the Assam cabinet made a significant decision to repeal the age-old Assam Muslim Marriages & Divorces Registration Act. This act contained provisions allowing marriage registration even if the bride and groom had not reached the legal ages of 18 and 21, as required by law. This move marks another significant step towards prohibiting child marriages in Assam.” The Assam cabinet’s decision comes a couple of weeks after the Uttarakhand Assembly passed the state’s Uniform Civil Code.

    "text": "NEW YORK - The Dow edged to a fresh record on Dec 28 following another sleepy holiday season session as investors get ready to mark big annual gains.\n“The last two months have been truly spectacular,” said Mr Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers. “No institutional investor can afford to be under-invested.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.1 per cent to 37,710.10, notching a second straight all-time closing high. The blue-chip index is up almost 14 per cent so far for all of 2023.\nThe broad-based S&P 500 climbed less than 0.1 per cent to 4,783.35, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was essentially flat at 15,095.14.\nEquities have trended higher since late October as the market has embraced moderating inflation and a strong labor market in the belief the US economy can avoid recession.\nData from the Department of Labour on Dec 28 showed a slight increase in unemployment claims. However, the level remains low by historic standards.\n“My concern right now is that both stocks and bonds have been rallying so aggressively, we really have to think about the scenarios that would allow this to continue,” said Mr Sosnick, who noted that bond market predictions of six interest rate cuts in 2024 implies a weaker economy.\nAmong individual companies, Apple advanced 0.2 per cent after a federal court on Dec 27 suspended a ban on the US sale of its latest watch models.\nA ban on sales of the watch had briefly gone into effect on Dec 26 after US President Joe Biden’s administration opted not to veto a ruling on the device’s patent.\nBoeing dipped 0.7 per cent as the US aviation giant said its 737 Max aircraft should be inspected to check for loose hardware on plane rudder control systems.\nThe inspection only lasts about two hours, but the issue comes on the heels of other manufacturing and production problems that have slowed Max deliveries.
