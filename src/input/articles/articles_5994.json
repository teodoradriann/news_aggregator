    "text": "TWN FALLS, Idaho — When it snows, the Twin Falls Parks and Rec Department has agreed to leave a portion of the Canyon Rim Trail unplowed, so people can make use of winter conditions for recreation. - Just like all property owners in the city, the Parks department is required to clear all sidewalks that are adjacent to streets. Once that is done, they can clear access to parks amenities. - When they are able, Parks will clear the Canyon Rim Trail from the Federation Point trailhead to the trailhead at Eastland and Poleline. - The eastern portion of the trail, from Eastland and Pole Line, past Evel Knievel jump site to Shoshone Falls will remain unplowed. (Below is the transcript from the broadcast story) After a weekend that saw eight inches or more of snow dropped on the Magic Valley, everybody is digging out. But with the snowfall comes some unique opportunities. Nat Sound I met with Twin Falls Parks and Rec director Wendy Davis for a little (in-town?) skiing... SOT Wendy In the winter time especially when we're stuck inside and it's dark, you get out, it takes me like 10 minutes to get out into it and think ah, ok, this is what it's all about. It's refreshing it's invigorating. Nothing like the fresh air to receive your spirit (22 seconds) The Parks Department prioritizes clearing city sidewalks and adjacent streets... before moving on to park amenities like the Canyon Rim trail.. but they thoughtfully leave portions untouched.. for those itching to get good use of their outdoor winter gear. SOT Wendy One of the things that I think is kind of exciting about a snow event, especially on the Canyon Trail, is the opportunity to do some winter sports - snowshoeing cross-country skiing, some different things in town - that we usually have to drive quite a way to get to enjoy— up north or south or whatever— and to be able to do it right in our backyard is kind of a fun opportunity that we don't get very often so (25 sec) SOT LORIEN - nat sound-ish \"well, this is gonna be really sketchy. Wish me luck. The good thing is that the soft snow should slow us down a little bit maybe. Yep, slowed me right down (24 sec) The east portion of the canyon rim, from the trailhead from Eastland and Pole Line, past the Evel Knievel jump site, down to Shoshone Falls will remain unplowed and snow-covered. For Wendy, the rare opportunity to get out into the snow is one way to make the best of winter, when many people want to hunker down and wait for warmer weather. SOT Wendy but if you snowmobile or cross country, skier downhill, ski or snowshoe or in photography and different things that get you out … those people don't winter and usually kind of thrive through those, dark months of January and February (18 sec)",

    "text": "ATP has recently updated its player profiles according to the latest season-ending results, which left the\nNovak Djokovic fans enraged. They updated the Serb’s profile but left it with more problems than before. While his records are updated, he is still not the leader in the ATP Finals and is equaled. Djokovic is the only player with seven titles at the ATP Finals but it shows that he shares the record.\nThe facts are not the only thing wrong, but there are a lot of formatting errors on the whole page, making it difficult to read. Including spacing errors and editing problems makes the whole bio seem boring and far from being interesting.\nFans who noticed this are enraged and have started firing shots at the ATP. “ATP has a bad case of Djokovic Derangement Syndrome” tweeted a fan on the post. Here are a few more plethora of comments from the disappointed fans.\nThere has always been a supposed problem with the ATP and Novak Djokovic. Over the years, fans have seen ATP covering up a few of the Serb’s records or his records are being overshadowed by other players.\nFrom not nominating Djokovic for any awards to not updating his player profile, the ATP is showing some hindrance when it comes to the 36-year-old. Novak Djokovic discloses Kobe Bryant’s advice to him when he considered retiring with only 12 Grand Slam titles to his name\nNovak Djokovic remains unshaken by unfair treatment by ATP\nOver the past few weeks, fans have witnessed a rise in incidents where the ATP has been unfair towards Novak Djokovic. The fans have always been there for their player despite this. They were left outraged when the ATP overlooked Novak Djokovic’s name for any award category, despite his stellar performance throughout the year.\nLater, the fans called out the organization for not\nupdating Djokovic’s page, which was updated a week after their complaining. Despite all this, the World No. 1 has never spoken about this and continues to mind his own business.\nAs the calendar year flips a new page, the players also turn over a new leaf, looking forward to a new season. Djokovic will start his new season a little early by featuring in the United Cup before heading to Australia where he defends his title at the\nAustralian Open.\nIn Case You Missed It:\nIga Swiatek admits she’s grown in handling the pressure of being World No. 1 as she looks forward to the 2024 season Roberto Bautista Agut recalls his horrific injury of getting his leg crushed by the horse he fell from\n- Do follow us on:\n- Follow FirstSportz on\nWhatsApp Channel Nikhil Sonmali",

    "text": "Prima un malore, poi vaga coi figli piccoli al centro dell’autostrada: salvati dalla polizia\nGiuseppe Cozzolino\nMomenti di paura sulla Caserta-Salerno, dove una donna in evidente stato confusionale stava vagando al centro della carreggiata con i due figli piccoli, rischiando di essere investita assieme a loro e provocare anche un incidente stradale. Fondamentale l'intervento della Polizia di Stato di Caserta, che è intervenuta immediatamente mettendo al sicuro la donna e i propri bambini.\nTutto è accaduto in mattinata, quando ai poliziotti della Stradale di Caserta Nord sono iniziate ad arrivare segnalazioni sulla presenza di persone in autostrada. Arrivati sull'A30 Caserta Salerno, i poliziotti hanno subito visto che si trattasse di una donna in difficoltà, con i due bambini piccoli al seguito, che camminava al centro dell'autostrada. E così i poliziotti hanno prima rallentato il flusso veicolare dell'autostrada, in modo da poter intervenire con sicurezza per mettere in salvo i tre.\nUna volta raggiunta la donna e i piccoli, i poliziotti hanno notato però che la stessa non fosse \"collaborativa\" con loro, ed in evidente stato confusionale. E così, dopo averla messa in salvo, hanno atteso l'arrivo del 118 che ha portata la donna in ospedale mentre i piccoli venivano tenuti dai poliziotti al sicuro in una vicina area di servizio. Dai controlli in ospedale è emerso che la donna fosse in stato confusionale in seguito ad un malore. I due bambini, nel frattempo, sono stati portati negli uffici della Polizia Stradale di Caserta Nord, dove sono stati accuditi fino all’arrivo del padre, nel frattempo avvisato del tutto. La donna è rimasta invece sotto osservazione in ospedale, ma sta bene e presto potrà tornare a casa dalla sua famiglia.\n<a href=\"https://www.fanpage.it/napoli/uomo-a-piedi-sullasse-mediano-tra-auto-in-corsa-prova-a-saltare-il-guard-rail-salvato-dalla-polizia/\">\n</a>",
