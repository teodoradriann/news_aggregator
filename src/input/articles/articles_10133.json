    "text": "(Adnkronos) - Inizio agosto di caldo rovente per l'Italia, ma con la prospettiva di un primo weekend del mese che si preannuncia meno afoso. Secondo l'ultimo aggiornamento del bollettino sulle ondate di calore del ministero della Salute, infatti, oggi venerdì 2 agosto, i capoluoghi con bollino rosso sono 10 - 2 meno di ieri - mentre per domani, sabato 3, le città con livello massimo di allerta scenderanno a 7. Contrassegnate dal bollino rosso sono oggi 10 delle 27 città monitorate dal ministero. Si tratta di Bologna, Bolzano, Brescia, Firenze, Frosinone, Latina, Perugia, Rieti, Roma e Viterbo. Bollino arancione, invece, per Bari e Campobasso. Domani, sabato 3 agosto, scenderanno quindi a 7 le città da bollino rosso (livello di rischio 3). L'allerta resterà massima a Firenze, Frosinone, Latina, Perugia, Rieti, Roma e Viterbo, mentre la maggior parte degli altri capoluoghi sarà contrassegnata dal bollino giallo (rischio 1). Rischio 2 (bollino arancione) solo a Catania, con Napoli e Trieste a rischio 0 (bollino verde). Dopo la giornata infernale di ieri, secondo gli esperti de ILMeteo.it le temperature continueranno ad essere altissime anche oggi con Siracusa a 41°C, Catania e Foggia a 39°C e quasi tutto il Sud con le zone interne di pianura a 38°C; in Sardegna vivremo ancora la nuova normalità con 43-44°C nelle zone lontane dal mare. E anche i temporali saranno ancora prepotenti al Nord: si prevedono rovesci intensi specie sulle Alpi, ma in locale discesa verso le pianure adiacenti. La traiettoria di questa nuova passata temporalesca deve essere ben definita dai modelli. Quel che è certo è che anche il Centro vivrà i primi momenti temporaleschi dopo una calma piatta durata circa 10 giorni: nella notte e al primo mattino di sabato 3 agosto sono previsti infatti rovesci e colpi di vento sull’Alto Adriatico con coinvolgimento successivo di tutte le regioni centrali e di parte del Nord-Est più interno: in pratica ritroveremo dei rovesci a macchia di leopardo dalla costa romagnola fino al Lazio, a mitigare un’afa opprimente che attanaglia da giorni tutti questi settori. Dopo questi temporali il quadro termo-igrometrico (temperatura e umidità) sarà meno folle, ci sarà una leggera discesa dei picchi di caldo, seppur temporanea. Infatti, già da lunedì 5 agosto, una nuova fiammata nordafricana guadagnerà terreno verso tutta l’Italia. Il caldo di Caronte non è finito, ma attenzione ai forti temporali al Centro-Nord.",

    "text": "Advertisement Sydney, N.S., Highland Arts Theatre marks ten-year anniversary The interior of the Highland Arts Theatre is pictured here. Share: When the [Highland Arts Theatre](https://www.highlandartstheatre.com/) first opened its doors in January 2014, no one could have predicted the story that would unfold over the next decade. \"Oh, I don't know that I ever thought that we'd make it to ten years,” said artistic director Wesley Colford. It was Colford's idea to convert the former St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church — a building more than a century old — into an approximately 400-seat theatre in Sydney's downtown. From the beginning, Colford says the odds were against them. \"I think I committed, in my head, to maybe five years that we'd try to make a go,” they said. “I didn't know if it would last that long. I expected at some point to have to move back to Toronto.\" While there were many hurdles for a not-for-profit depending mostly on ticket sales, the biggest was, of course, the COVID-19 pandemic. By mid-2020, \"The HAT,” as it's known, faced bankruptcy, but they pivoted — and in dramatic fashion. An online fundraiser raised more than $50,000 in a matter of months in the middle of the pandemic and saved the theatre from closure. \"It really gave us a chance to sit back, say 'Why are we here?' and the answer, ultimately, is this community,’” Colford said. When Queen Elizabeth II died in September 2022, 'God Save the Queen' rang out from the former church bells at the HAT. It was one of the more poignant examples of the theatre’s role in downtown Sydney. “I feel like every time there's something substantial, the bells are called upon,” said Glenda Watt, who played the bells that day and on many other occasions. “When the shootings occurred on the Mainland, the bells were here. During COVID lockdown, the bells were here.\" To celebrate their big milestone, the HAT is holding a special lineup of performances this week. \"It's called 'Cheers to Ten Years,’ Colford said. “It's running Tuesday to Sunday, starting on January 9, and we have some of the best hits from our best performers over the entire ten years.\" \"I grew up knowing I wanted to make a career in theatre, and knowing or expecting I would have to move somewhere else to do that,” Colford said. “The fact I get to be here in the place I love, working with people I love, making incredible things — that's something I never expected, and something I can't be more grateful for.\"",

    "text": "SEOUL — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged his party to \"accelerate\" war preparations including its nuclear programme, state media said on Thursday.\nThe comments came just a week after Kim warned Pyongyang would not hesitate to launch a nuclear attack if \"provoked\" with nukes.\nKim made the comments at the North's ongoing year-end party meeting, where he is expected to unveil key policy decisions for 2024.\nKim asked the party to \"further accelerate the war preparations\" across sectors, including nuclear weapons and civil defence, Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency reported.\nHe also stressed that the \"military situation\" on the Korean Peninsula had become \"extreme\" due to \"unprecedented\" anti-North confrontations with Washington.\nSeoul, Tokyo and Washington have ramped up defence cooperation in the face of a record-breaking series of weapons tests by Pyongyang this year and recently activated a system to share real-time data on North Korean missile launches.\nEarlier this month, a US nuclear-powered submarine arrived in the South Korean port city of Busan, and Washington flew its long-range bombers in drills with Seoul and Tokyo.\nThe North has previously described the participation of US strategic assets, such as B-52 bombers, in joint drills on the Korean peninsula as the \"intentional nuclear war provocative moves of the US\".\nPyongyang this year successfully launched a reconnaissance satellite, enshrined its status as a nuclear power in its constitution, and test-fired the most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile in its arsenal.\nKim earlier this week defined 2023 as a “year of great turn and great change” in which Pyongyang saw “eye-opening victories”.\nLast week, the United Nations atomic agency said a second reactor at North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear facility appeared to be operational, calling it “deeply regrettable”.\n‘Nuclear confrontation’\nAt last year’s year-end party meeting, Kim had called “for an exponential increase of the country’s nuclear arsenal”.\nThe United States and South Korea earlier this month held the second meeting of their Nuclear Consultative Group in Washington, where they discussed nuclear deterrence options in the event of conflict with the North.\nThey warned that any nuclear attack from Pyongyang on the United States or South Korea would result in the end of the Kim regime.\nA spokesperson for North Korea’s defence ministry then slammed the allies’ plans to expand annual joint military exercises next year to include a nuclear operation drill, calling it “an open declaration on nuclear confrontation”.\nPyongyang declared itself an “irreversible” nuclear power last year and has repeatedly said it will never give up its nukes programme, which the regime views as essential for its survival.\nThe United Nations Security Council has adopted many resolutions calling on North Korea to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since it first conducted a nuclear test in 2006.",

    "text": "Devils Lake boys basketball looking to repeat as state champions\nThe No. 2 Firebirds will face No. 7 Des Lacs-Burlington at 1 p.m. Thursday at the Bismarck Event Center\nGRAND FORKS — Devils Lake boys basketball knocked off Kindred last year to win its first state championship in 99 years.\nThe goal this season, since Day 1 of practice, has been to repeat as state champions.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Taking each day and getting better every single day,” coach Dustin Brodina said, “and adding those building blocks to our goal of reaching the top.”\nThe No. 2-seeded Firebirds’ search for a second-straight state title starts at 1 p.m. Thursday against Des Lacs-Burlington in the first round of the Division A boys basketball state tournament at the Bismarck Event Center.\n“Our preparation and our practices pretty much stay the same,” Brodina said. “We focus on fundamentals, teamwork and competitive greatness as staples for every practice. We have many seniors in this group, and they’re focused every day on the task at hand.”\nDevils Lake has lost one game this season — to No. 1 seed Kindred. The game, played at Kindred, ended with a score of 52-47.\nThe Firebirds, entering the state tournament with a 22-1 record, rolled over Thompson 70-41 last week to win the Region 2A title.\nAfter the game, Brodina was named the region’s coach of the year. His son, senior Parker Brodina, was named the region senior athlete of the year.\nMason Palmer, Oliver Wirth and Joel Nelson were also named all-region players.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“They’ve been solid for us all year in the offensive and defensive ends,” Dustin Brodina said. “Trason Beck rounds out our starting five, and is also solid defensively. We make defense a priority in everything we do. Positioning and effort are a couple big things we stress each day and all those guys do a great job of that.”\nThe Firebirds’ goal is to hold opponents to 40 points per game.\nOpponents are averaging 46 points per game against Devils Lake this season.\nOn the offensive end, the Firebirds are scoring 73 points per game, led by Parker Brodina’s 16.8 points per game. He also leads the Firebirds with 5.5 rebounds per game.\nPalmer averages 15 points a game, and Wirth adds 12.4 points per game. Nelson averages 11.6 points per game and 5.4 rebounds per game.\nDevils Lake, despite a successful year and a No. 2 seed, isn’t overlooking No. 7 Des Lacs-Burlington.\n“They’re an extremely disciplined team that doesn’t make mistakes at all,” Dustin Brodina said. “Watching film, they play very hard and their defense is solid. For us to be competitive with them, we will need to focus on the defensive end, keep them away from the basket, rebound and hopefully get some easy baskets in transition.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",

La orden ejecutiva fue firmada este jueves, [comunicó](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/01/statement-from-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-action-to-promote-peace-security-and-stability-in-the-west-bank/) el asesor presidencial, Jake Sullivan. El mandatario implementó estas medidas para abordar las acciones que socavan la paz, la seguridad y la estabilidad en Cisjordania, explicó el asesor. En un futuro, este documento permitirá a EE.UU. sancionar a quienes dirijan o participen en ciertas acciones, incluidos actos o amenazas de violencia contra civiles, intimidación de civiles para obligarlos a abandonar sus hogares, [destruir](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/468351-paises-europa-israel-cesar-demoliciones-cisjordania) o confiscar propiedades o participar en actividades terroristas en Occidente. [EE.UU. condena una orden ministerial de Israel que podría dar la luz verde a un nuevo asentamiento](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/467837-eeuu-condena-orden-israel-asentamiento) Sullivan recordó que el presidente Biden había expresado su preocupación por el aumento de la violencia en Cisjordania por parte de actores extremistas, en particular la protagonizada por los colonos, que alcanzó niveles récord en 2023. Esta violencia representa una grave amenaza para la paz, seguridad y estabilidad en Cisjordania, Israel y la región de Medio Oriente, sostuvo el funcionario. En diciembre pasado, una [investigación periodística](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/493576-guardian-estadounidenses-donan-millones-dolares) de The Guardian puso al descubierto varias herramientas de recolecta de fondos entre donantes estadounidenses y canadienses para financiar los escuadrones paramilitares adscritos a comunidades israelíes, y también la construcción de asentamientos ilegales para la población hebrea en Cisjordania. Desde el inicio de las actuales hostilidades, los donantes habían transferido alrededor de 5,3 millones de dólares en beneficio de militares, paramilitares y colonos.",
