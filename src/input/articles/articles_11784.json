    "text": "Shortly before the shift from 2023 to 2024, Justine Moore, partner at a16z,\npublished a insightful thread 🧵 that explores the evolution of generative AI video and her take on its state and near-term future.\nSo, what’s next for AI video?\nFirst of all, it’s a runaway category as pictured in Moore’s timeline. She is already tracking 21 promising players that have emerged in just one year, not including the array of up-and-coming startups not included in her list\nIn fact, her work is inspiring how we prioritize the category in the next rev of our\nGenAI Prism ( JESS3 + Conor Grennan)\nWhat do these 21 companies share in common? According to Moore, most companies are focused on the following:\n🔗 Temporal coherence – do characters/scenes stay consistent between frames?\n🕹️ Control – can you control what happens + how the “camera” moves?\n⏳ Length – can you make clips beyond a couple of seconds?\nMoore also predicts integrated workflows on the horizon…\n“Making quality video is a LOT of work, from scripting/storyboarding to editing, upscaling, sound…,” she observed. “Most products focus on pure generation – you stitch together outputs elsewhere.”\nHer point is that creators need an end-to-end workspace!\nHere’s one example of the extent creators have to piece together solutions today.\nhttps://twitter.com/ammaar/status/1731120455258616283\nHer questions for 2024 are those we too should follow…\n1) Will Meta and Google finally release their models?\n2) What’s the role of open source? Many products are built on SD, but true foundation models tend to be closed.\n3) Who will crack the data challenge? Quality, labeled video data is sparse.\nMoore put together a public\nGoogle Doc that tracks the 21 AI video companies she’s tracking with links.\nThat’s it for this round! Stay tuned for the next edition Generative Insights in AI.\nBrian Solis | Author, Keynote Speaker, Futurist\nBrian Solis is world-renowned digital analyst, anthropologist and futurist.

    "text": "According to a recent article by John Hopkins researchers published in the JAMA Surgery journal, a overwhelming majority of those who undergo gender-affirming surgery do not regret the treatment afterwards. As reported by U.S. News , less than 1% of people who underwent gender-affirming surgery within the medical literature on post-surgery regret reviewed by the researchers actually regretted receiving treatment. That represents a lower rate of regret than is seen from any kind of surgery among cisgender individuals.\n“Policymakers across the US have been using the potential for surgical regret to justify an unprecedented wave of legislation that bans transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youths from accessing gender-affirming care (GAC), a safe and effective form of health care that allows TGD individuals to align their bodies with their own internal sense of self,” the article noted.\nExplore Piedmont announces ‘unprecedented access to groundbreaking medical advances’ for Georgia patients “Proponents of these policies often speculate that TGD individuals who undergo gender-affirming surgeries (GAS) would later regret their decision to undergo such procedures. Despite this supposed fear, evidence suggests that less than 1% of TGD individuals who receive GAS report surgical regret.”\nThe researchers noted that accurately evaluating the post-surgery satisfaction of patients remains a challenge. They suggested patients be asked about their feelings concerning gender-affirming surgeries no sooner than a year after surgery. A patient’s age, race, education and quality of life should also be considered when determining relevant influences on their regrets concerning the surgery.\nExplore What is a forensic nurse? Everything to know about this unique role The study was led by Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health assistant professor Harry Barbee, alongside Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health postdoctoral research fellow Dr. Bashar Hassan and Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health director Dr. Fan Liang.\nAbout the Author\nHunter Boyce Hunter Boyce is a writer, digital producer and journalist home grown from a Burke County, Georgia farm.

    "text": "Matt and Mercedes Schlapp: 'Our faith in God sustained us' amid sexual misconduct allegations A prominent political activist is crediting his “faith in God” with helping him as he faced allegations of sexual misconduct that he condemned as part of a “relentless war” against him. Matt Schlapp, who serves as chairman of the grassroots advocacy group The American Conservative Union, released a [statement](https://www.digital.cpac.org/us/statements/03-26-2024/statement-from-matt-and-mercedes-schlapp) along with his wife, Mercedes, Tuesday after litigation stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct against him reached a $480,000 settlement: “From the beginning, we asserted our innocence. Our family was attacked by a left-wing media that is focused on the destruction of conservatives regardless of the truth and the facts.” After insisting that “we emerge from this ordeal stronger as husband and wife, stronger as parents to our five daughters, [and] stronger as friends to those who stood by us,” the Schlapps asserted that “our faith in God sustained us.” They added, “Our understanding of what is truly important in life — our faith in God and loving our family and friends — has been brought into sharp focus as never before.” “We also learned that the left is waging a relentless war against those of us who still hold fast to the principles of America’s founding and the liberty that has endured throughout our 248-year history,” they added. “The left no longer leaves disagreements on the political battlefield. Increasingly, they have gained a stranglehold on the mainstream media, social media and the legal system which they use to try to silence, shame, and bankrupt Americans who have contrary, yet correct viewpoints.” The Schlapps further declared that “our eyes are wide open” because “we understand the struggle better and we learned we must stand our ground and fight or else the haters on the left will destroy every conservative and ultimately our nation.” The Schlapps’ statement comes as [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/27/politics/matt-schlapp-settlement-sexual-assault-lawsuit/index.html) is reporting that Carlton Huffman, who filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct on the part of the ACU chairman, has received a $480,000 settlement. In the [lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23574199-john-doe-v-matthew-schlapp-and-mercedes-schlapp), filed in the Circuit Court for the city of Alexandria, Virginia, last year, the then-anonymous Huffman maintained that as he went to a bar with the ACU chairman, “Schlapp sat unusually close to Mr. Doe, such that his leg repeatedly contacted and was in almost constant contact with Mr. Doe’s leg.” The complaint also stated that “Mr. Schlapp was so close to Mr. Doe that he bumped into Mr. Doe’s torso where Mr. Doe had a Sig Sauer handgun holstered, asked about it, and professed an unfamiliarity with this weapon and firearms generally.” “Mr. Schlapp also encouraged Mr. Doe to have more drinks despite the fact that Mr. Doe was driving,” the lawsuit said. The document contended that Schlapp committed sexual battery by “fondling Mr. Doe’s genital area in a sustained fashion” as the plaintiff drove the longtime political operative around Atlanta, Georgia ahead of a United States Senate election there during the 2022 election cycle. According to the complaint, “When they reached the Hotel, Mr. Schlapp invited Mr. Doe to come to his hotel room. Mr. Doe declined the invitation.” The lawsuit sought a $7 million judgment against Schlapp in addition to $700,000 in damages against the ACU chairman while asking for a $3 million judgment against both Schlapps and an additional $700,000 in damages against the couple. While Mrs. Schlapp did not face allegations of sexual harassment, the lawsuit claims she made “false and defamatory” statements against the plaintiff, characterizing him as a “troubled individual” who was fired for “lying on his resume.” [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/08/matt-schlapp-cpac-accuser-sexual-misconduct/) reported that Huffman went public with his identity after a judge ruled that he could not proceed anonymously. The ACU is best known as the organization that puts on the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of grassroots conservative activists. The Schlapps' legal team released a statement from the accuser, issued as part of the agreement that resulted in Huffman receiving $480,000, asserting that “the claims made in my lawsuits were the result of a complete misunderstanding, and I regret that the lawsuit caused pain to the Schlapp family” in addition to insisting that “neither the Schlapps nor the ACU paid me anything to dismiss my claims against them.” CNN reported that the settlement was financed through an insurance payment.

    "text": "New Illinois law mandates paid time off for workers SPRINGFIELD (WGEM) - A new Illinois law takes effect Jan. 1, mandating businesses give their full-time employees at least 40 hours of paid time off annually. “This is about bringing dignity to all workers because that is who is impacted by paid leave for all,” state Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, said when Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed the legislation on March 13. She, along with state Sen. Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester, sponsored the [legislation](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?name=102-1143&GA=102&SessionId=110&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=208&GAID=16&SpecSess=&Session=). The law requires employers give full-time workers at least one hour of paid time off per 40 hours worked and allow them to accrue a minimum of 40 hours of paid time off annually. “Thanks to this measure, workers have the peace of mind that they can take care of themselves today without worrying about the consequences tomorrow,” Lightford said at the signing ceremony. While the law may bring peace of mind to workers, Noah Finley, the Illinois state director for the National Federation of Independent Business said it brings uncertainty to small businesses across the state. “They’re facing this new mandate they’re having to figure out and, like, we’ve held webinars, the Department of Labor has held webinars but they’re still trying to figure out exactly what that means,” he said. “And it’s going to cost them, they know that, but exactly how that plays out is not entirely clear and it’s just a whole slew of uncertainty.” Adding to the uncertainty, is the Illinois Department of Labor’s (DOL) rulemaking process. Though the new law goes into effect Jan. 1, Finley said he doesn’t expect to see DOL’s rules approved until at least March. Businesses can learn more about the new law on the DOL’s [website](https://labor.illinois.gov/laws-rules/paidleave.html). There’s also a link to a poster all businesses must display informing workers of their rights under the new law. Some workers are exempt from the new law. They include federal workers and college students who work part-time for the university. Copyright 2023 WGEM. All rights reserved.",
