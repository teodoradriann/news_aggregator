    "text": "Medien\nStreaming-Boom flacht ab - YouTube stark\nStreaming-Boom flacht ab - YouTube stark\nStreaming-Boom flacht ab - YouTube stark\nDiesen Artikel vorlesen lassen.\nFür die Streaminganbieter sind die Jahre des riesigen Wachstums offensichtlich vorbei. Das ältere Publikum wird jetzt als Zielgruppe attraktiver, besagt eine großangelegte Analyse von Medienforschern.\nDie Streaminganbieter in Deutschland erreichen nur bei Menschen über 30 noch Zuwächse. «Erstmals ziehen die 30- bis 49-Jährigen bei der Streaming-Abo-Nutzung mit 68 Prozent an den Jüngeren (14-29 Jahre) mit 66 Prozent vorbei», steht in der Bewegtbild-Studie «Screens in Motion 2025» der Zeitschrift «TV Spielfilm» aus dem Burda Verlag.\nAufgrund des höheren Bevölkerungsanteils stelle die mittlere Altersgruppe ohnehin die mit Abstand größte Masse der Streaming-Abo-Nutzer. Die Autoren der Studie sehen alles in allem erstmals eine «gewisse Sättigung» auf Deutschlands Streamingmarkt.\nStreaming schrumpft im jungen Publikum leicht\nDie Langzeitentwicklung der Sehdauern seit 2019 zeigt für jüngere Abonnenten sogar einen minimalen Rückgang der täglichen Streaming-Sehdauer auf hohem Niveau von 2 Minuten auf 1 Stunde 16 Minuten, wie in der Studie zu lesen ist. «In der mittleren Altersgruppe (30-49 Jahre) hat die Sehdauer Streaming im gleichen Zeitraum um 32 Minuten zugenommen, auf nun ebenfalls 1 Stunde 16 Minuten.»\nDie über 50-Jährigen gucken den Ergebnissen zufolge aktuell nur 42 Minuten täglich Streamingangebote, das ist aber eine Zunahme um 25 Minuten. Größeres Neukunden-Potenzial ist demnach bei dem älteren Publikum zu vermuten.\nZwar seien Netflix und Prime Video nach wie vor die Platzhirsche. Auf Platz drei von den Nutzeranteilen her folge allerdings auf ähnlichem Niveau schon YouTube, also eine Video-Plattform. «Warum das so ist? Es hängt sicherlich mit dem Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zusammen», sagte die Verantwortliche von «Screens in Motion», Marion Sperlich, der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Berlin. Sie ist zugleich Head of Research Market Media Insights im Burda-Verlag.\nTrend zum Abo-Hopping\n«Hier besteht eine zunehmende Sensibilität bei den Streaming-Abonnenten», erläuterte Sperlich. «Stehen Preis und Nutzung nicht mehr im Verhältnis, das heißt sind zum Beispiel nur noch wenige interessierende Formate verfügbar, wird ein Abo gekündigt und ein neues bei einem anderen Anbieter abgeschlossen. Abo-Hopping könnte man das nennen. Prime Video und Netflix scheinen folglich ihre Nutzer am besten mit ihren Inhalten bei Laune zu halten.»\nDie Mediatheken der Öffentlich-Rechtlichen hätten am Streamingboom der vergangenen Jahre durchaus profitiert, so Sperlich. «Wir wissen, dass die lineare TV-Nutzung zurückgeht, aktuell um 45 Minuten Sehdauer pro Tag im Vergleich zu 2019. Die Mediatheken der Sender allerdings, die im Prinzip die gleichen Inhalte anbieten, werden stärker genutzt. Das heißt, das, was klassisches TV an Sehdauer oder auch Nutzeranteilen verliert, geht nicht allein auf die Streaming-Abo-Anbieter über, sondern auch auf die eigenen Mediatheken.»\nFür «Screens in Motion 2025» hat das Marktforschungsinstitut YouGov Anfang März rund 2.000 Menschen befragt. Die Studie gilt als repräsentativ für die Bevölkerung ab 14 Jahren mit Onlinezugang in Deutschland.",

    "text": "The grey skies finally came to an end this afternoon and the sun should stick around for at least a day. With the clear skies, overnight temperatures will drop rather quickly so don't be surprised to wake up to temps in the teens early on. While the sun will be a nice change of pace, many are still wondering when our fist inch of snow for the year will fall, and we are keeping our eye on multiple small chances for later this week.\nTonight: Decreasing clouds and a little chilly.\nLow: 14 Wind: NW around 5\nThursday: Partly or mostly sunny and cool.\nHigh: 27 Wind: Becoming SW 5-10\nThursday Night: Partly cloudy.\nLow: 16\nFriday: More clouds than sun. (A slight chance of snow showers at night)\nHigh: 32\nSaturday: Mostly cloudy with a small chance of scattered snow showers or flurries\nHigh: 33\nThe clouds will break up a little for tomorrow and it will be a tad cooler. Highs on Thursday will be in the mid to upper 20s. The clouds will increase once again on Friday as well as the temperature. The mercury should top out in the low 30s for the last day of the work week.\nA slight chance of snow showers and flurries will develop Friday night into Saturday and Saturday will be mild once again with highs in the low 30s. A bit more developed trough of low pressure will drift across Wisconsin Saturday night into Sunday morning and this should produce some scattered light snow. There might be enough to coat the ground Sunday morning. Dry weather will then develop later Sunday into Monday. Highs on both days will be in the low 30s.\nA strong low pressure system moving into the Midwest on Tuesday could end up affecting our area. As of now, it looks like the highest potential for a few inches of snow will be southeast of Marathon County. Otherwise, Tuesday will be a windy day with highs in the low 30s.\nHave a great rest of the week! Meteorologist Jackson Garlock\nOn this date in weather history:\n1990 - A winter storm in the southwestern U.S. spread snow across Colorado and New Mexico. Heavy snow fell in southwestern Colorado, with 13 inches reported at Wolf Creek Pass. Snow spread into the Central Plains Region during the day, with six inches reported at Garden City KS. (National Weather Summary)\n1994 - A heavy wet snow blanketed much of the state of Ohio, with 12 to 18 inches reported in counties along the Ohio River. Newport received 21 inches. Thunder and lightning accompanied the snow, with five inches reported in Washington County and Noble County between 7 AM and 8 AM Tuesday. Parts of Washington County were without electricity for eight days following the storm.(National Weather Summary) (Storm Data)",

    "text": "SIESTA KEY, Fla. (WSVN) — A retired police officer and his family pulled off a sinking save when they came to a couple’s rescue while vacationing on the west coast of Florida. The good Samaritans sprang into action after a storm hit Siesta Key, June 11. Ohio residents Dean and Shana Ramsey were in their car when they got swept into a body of water. “The water sucked me right down into – us into that lagoon,” said Dean. But Kentucky resident Mike Bell and family were in the right place at the right time. “I ran over to the edge of the water and kind of stopped for a second. I realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” said Bell. “At about that time, [my wife] Ginger exited the front of the door, which is very close to the pond, and I looked at her and I said, ‘We need flotation devices.'” Everyone was able to get out OK. The Ramseys were surprised to learn they share an Ohio connection with their rescuer. Bell is a retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant. The families said they plan to reunite in the near future. Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

    "title": "Melbourne Pioneers 3D-Printed Homes: A Leap into Sustainable and Affordable Housing",
    "text": "In a groundbreaking stride towards the future of housing, Melbourne is set to witness the construction of two 3-D printed homes, a pioneering initiative led by Space Coast Habitat for Humanity and Macedonia Development Corporation. With the streets of Melbourne as its canvas and the innovative prowess of Apis Cor, a local heavyweight in 3-D printing, this project not only marks a significant milestone for the city but also positions it as a trailblazer in adopting futuristic building technologies. The project, with a budget of $400,000, is a testament to the collaborative spirit of the community, funded through contributions from the City of Melbourne via the American Rescue Plan and Wells Fargo. As construction gears up to commence in the summer of 2024, the Lipscomb Street site is not just a plot of land but a beacon of progress, signaling a new era in sustainable and affordable housing.\nA Leap Into the Future\nThe collaboration between Space Coast Habitat for Humanity and Macedonia Development Corporation, with Apis Cor at the helm, is more than a construction project. It's a bold leap into the future of housing, leveraging 3-D printing technology to create homes that are not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly. This initiative represents a significant shift in how we think about building homes, moving away from traditional construction methods towards more innovative, efficient, and sustainable practices. The engagement of Apis Cor, headquartered in Melbourne, underscores the project's commitment to local expertise and innovation, while also highlighting the city's emerging status as a hub for technological advancement in the construction industry.\nBuilding More Than Homes\nAt the heart of this initiative is a vision that extends beyond the mere construction of houses. These 3-D printed homes on Lipscomb Street symbolize a new chapter in community development and social responsibility. By harnessing the power of cutting-edge technology, Space Coast Habitat for Humanity and Macedonia Development Corporation are not just building houses; they're crafting a future where affordability does not come at the expense of quality or sustainability. This project, funded by the City of Melbourne and Wells Fargo, demonstrates a remarkable synergy between public institutions, private organizations, and nonprofit entities, all converging towards a common goal of making housing accessible and sustainable for all.\nA Blueprint for Tomorrow\nThe undertaking of constructing Melbourne's first 3-D printed homes is more than a novel venture; it serves as a blueprint for the future. As one of the only three Habitat 3-D builds across the United States, alongside Arizona and Virginia, Melbourne's project sets a precedent for how communities can embrace technology to address housing crises. The implications of this project extend far beyond its physical boundaries, offering a glimpse into a world where technology and humanity intersect to create solutions that are both innovative and inclusive. With a focus on sustainability, affordability, and community collaboration, the initiative led by Space Coast Habitat for Humanity, Macedonia Development Corporation, and Apis Cor is paving the way for a new era in housing—one where everyone has a place to call home.\nAs the summer of 2024 approaches and the wheels of progress begin to turn on Lipscomb Street, Melbourne stands at the cusp of a revolutionary transition in housing. The collaborative efforts of Space Coast Habitat for Humanity, Macedonia Development Corporation, and Apis Cor, supported by the City of Melbourne and Wells Fargo, are not just about constructing homes but about laying the foundation for a future where technology and innovation drive social change. This project not only highlights Melbourne's commitment to embracing new technologies but also its dedication to fostering a community where sustainability and affordability go hand in hand. As these two 3-D printed homes rise from the ground, they will stand as monuments of hope, innovation, and community spirit, signaling a new chapter in the story of Melbourne—a chapter where the future of housing is being rewritten.",
