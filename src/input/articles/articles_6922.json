Con una vittoria convincente su Daniil Medvedev, numero cinque del seeding, Sinner ha dimostrato ancora una volta perché è considerato uno dei migliori tennisti del momento. Il punteggio finale di 6-2, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 riflette una partita dominata dall'altoatesino, con l'unico passaggio a vuoto nel secondo set. La vittoria su Medvedev non è solo un trionfo personale per Sinner, ma anche una rivincita dopo la sconfitta subita a Wimbledon. Questo successo lo porta alle semifinali degli US Open, un risultato che conferma la sua posizione di leader nel ranking ATP. La partita è iniziata con Sinner che ha scelto di ricevere dopo aver vinto il sorteggio. Medvedev ha commesso due doppi falli nel primo turno di battuta, permettendo a Sinner di prendere il controllo del match fin dall'inizio. Il primo set è stato un dominio totale di Sinner, che ha chiuso con un netto 6-2. Tuttavia, nel secondo set, Medvedev ha mostrato segni di ripresa, vincendo 6-1. Ma Sinner non si è lasciato scoraggiare e ha risposto con un altro set dominante, chiudendo 6-1. Nel quarto set, Sinner ha mantenuto la calma e ha chiuso la partita con un 6-4, assicurandosi un posto in semifinale. Questa vittoria non è solo un passo avanti nel torneo, ma anche un segnale forte per i suoi avversari. Sinner ha dimostrato di avere la capacità di recuperare rapidamente dopo una sconfitta e di mantenere un alto livello di gioco. La sua prestazione agli US Open finora è stata praticamente perfetta, e ora si prepara ad affrontare il britannico Jack Draper, numero 25 del mondo, per un posto in finale.",

    "text": "On our last coverage of NewtekOne, Inc. (NASDAQ:\nNEWT) we favored the lower-risk NewtekOne, Inc. CAL NEWT 28 (NASDAQ: NEWTI), \"baby bonds\", over the common shares. In general, we have stayed out of NEWT as it made the erroneous decision to abandon the BDC model and run with the bank-holding company setup.\nTime and price fix a lot of things, and the stock has seen scores of dividend investors leave for higher-yielding pastures. Are we at a turning point?\nThe Key Question\nWhen you are a BDC or a REIT or even one of those closed end funds which focuses on distributions, the main question is always about yield. What matters is what is your sustainable yield. Or more accurately, what people believe is your sustainable yield. NEWT got a double whammy from that as people actually took their BDC powered payments during COVID-19, which was driven by rather one-off circumstances, to represent a sustainable yield. Of course that proved incorrect, but even under the new bank holding model, NEWT's payout has been extremely stingy. So that won't attract any investors, and even the ones in it today are looking at where they can exit. To attract money from the institutions at this point, NEWT needs to demonstrate that the big error in abandoning the BDC model, was only a modest error. That means growing earnings per share.\nNeedless to say, the recent news release, went exactly in the opposite direction as NEWT lowered it 2023 EPS guidance range to $1.60-$1.80 compared with its previous range of $1.70-$2.00 (consensus estimate of $1.73). It also introduced 2024 EPS guidance of just $1.80-$2.00 with consensus estimates sitting at the time at $2.35. The move in EPS estimates over the last six months has been really poor and this explains the movement in the stock.\nOutlook\nLending companies are facing a very challenging 2024 as the yield curve remains deeply inverted.\nA quick glance at the S&P 500 (\nSPY) or even the financial index, might make you forget that things look bad here, but that is the stark reality. Such an inverted curve portends problems from a probable deep recession or from a big dislocation as the curve steepens. It is not just NEWT that is facing these problems. Most regional banks are seeing the same trends.\nYes, NEWT is not a regional bank, but it is hard to argue that what it is doing, creating a niche in small business lending, while trying to get tons of free checking accounts opened, is not the regional banking model. Our earlier point stands on this one. NEWT is not cheap, when you compare it against quality regional banks like New York Community Bancorp (\nNYCB) or M&T Bank Corp ( MTB). This is true when you examine P/E ratios or even dividends yields.\nWe would also argue that those two are safer in our opinion and less vulnerable to a recession. FDIC recently showed the world how safe it thought NYCB was when it chose it to takeover the deposits\nfrom Signature Bank. So anyone looking for quality plays with high dividend yields, in the regional bank arena, is not going to NEWT.\nWe think NEWT likely muddles through 2024 as it struggles to deliver the growth it expected when it left the BDC model. Our previous range for NEWT was between $11.50-$14.50. For the next 12 months, we would look between $11.50-$16.00, with the higher end of that likely coming early in the year as NEWT rebounds from tax-loss selling. Investors should consider selling covered calls on a spike to enhance their yield. We think more downgrades to the earnings are probable, and that is the biggest risk factor for investors. We maintain a \"hold\" for now and might consider purchasing this under $12.00 down the line.\nBaby Bonds\nThe stripped price for NEWTI has appreciated modestly since our previous article. It currently trades near par when you remove the accumulated interest. But it remains a great place to make 8.0%. We still like it as our best play on NEWT.\nNewtekOne, Inc. 5.75% NT 24 (NASDAQ:\nNEWTL) is an extremely interesting baby bond for those keen on taking no duration risk whatsoever. The bond matures on August 1, 2024 and, as we write this, is trading at $24.85. That with the 5.75% coupon might not make it sound incredibly enticing. But the stripped price is $24.58 and that creates a yield to maturity of 8.60%. That is a great bet in this uncertain environment.\nPlease note that this is not financial advice. It may seem like it, sound like it, but surprisingly, it is not. Investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult with a professional who knows their objectives and constraints.\nAre you looking for Real Yields which reduce portfolio volatility?\nConservative Income Portfolio targets the best value stocks with the highest margins of safety.

    "title": "The Power of Positivity: How to Cultivate a Positive Mindset in a Negative World",
    "text": "The way people treat you is a reflection of themselves. We’ve all heard that saying before and it’s true. A person can only bring to the plate what they have. If a person is a negative and bad energy person, they’re only going to bring bad energy and you’ll be able to notice this if you feel down or not happy after you hangout with them or talk to them. Don’t take into mind rude people or if someone says something hurtful to you because that’s a reflection of themselves and as long as you know who you are and your values a rude person shouldn’t matter to you. When you’re secure in yourself and life not much can bother you.\nInorder to cultivate a positive mindset in a negative world you have to choose good people to surround yourself with. I struggle with this apparently and I think it may be my lack of boundaries with people and not speaking up. Therefore, make sure you set healthy boundaries with the people in your life so you can protect your energy and show some love to yourself so no one can ruin your mood and drain you. An example of this could look like a friend who loves to gossip, but that isn’t your thing to bringing down others, so you could tell that friend you’d rather not talk about gossip because that’s low vibe energy. Also speak up if someone is overstepping your boundaries so that person can respect your boundaries and know or maybe their true colors will show once you set boundaries and you might need to cut them off. Once you surround yourself with people you can be 100% yourself around and that makes you happy after you talk or hangout with them, then you’re set up for a happier life.\nAnother way to cultivate a positive mindset is by practicing gratitude. I didn’t realize how much that can impact you until my boss shared that everyday she practices gratitude and looks at the brighter side of things! The way she thinks inspires me because she’s always a nice person to everyone throughout everything. My advice is to either journal down things you’re grateful for and it doesn’t have to be everyday, you can take baby steps and start off by adding this into your routine weekly or maybe say them outloud every morning before you start your day to put you in a positive mindset.\nDoing things that make you happy helps you be more positive. We often get too busy with school, work, and life that we forget to nourish ourselves and do things that make us happy. Adding things to your routine like a hobby that makes you happy will make you be in a more positive mindset. Keeping up with practicing gratitude, doing things you love, and surrounding yourself with positivity is a great way to start to have a positive mindset! Don’t feed into negative energy or negative people any of your time. Protect your peace. Of course there’s way more ways that you can enforce positivity in your life but I think these three are a great foundation to start with.",

    "title": "Trump demands Maine secretary of state recuse herself in 14th Amendment challenge - ABC7 New York",
    "text": "Former President Donald Trump's legal team filed a request on Wednesday in Maine asking Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, to recuse herself from ruling on his ballot eligibility in the state. Bellows is expected to rule on three challenges that seek to disqualify Trump from the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment and the 22nd Amendment. \"The Secretary is a completely biased Democrat partisan and a Biden supporter who is incapable of making a fair decision and allowing the people of Maine the right to vote for the candidate of their choosing,\" Trump's team said in a statement. \"Any attempt to remove President Trump's name from the ballot is blatant election interference.\" In the statement, Trump's team said the secretary's \"personal animus and bias\" is \"so deep that she is rendered incapable of allowing a fair hearing of this pressing matter.\" Trump is facing more than a dozen tests over his ballot eligibility under the 14th Amendment in various state and federal courts. Earlier on Wednesday, Michigan's Supreme Court became the latest to decide that the former president would not be disqualified from running in the state's GOP primary. Maine is the first state to allow its secretary of state to rule on a challenge. Bellows was set to rule on the challenges last Friday, but her decision was delayed until this week, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State's office said, due to technical difficulties and in light of the Colorado Supreme Court ruling on the matter last week. Once Bellows issues her ruling, if there are challengers to the decision, they can appeal in state court. On Dec. 15, Bellows presided over a daylong consolidated hearing at the Maine State House in Augusta, which considered three challenges filed with state election officials the week prior, all seeking to bar Trump from appearing on Maine's Republican primary ballot. The most high-profile challenge comes from three Maine politicians: former Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling and former state Sens. Kim Rosen, a Republican, and Tom Saviello, who is a former Republican-turned-independent, who have based their argument on the 14th Amendment. Late Wednesday, the Colorado Republican State Central Committee appealed their state's Supreme Court decision that ruled Trump off the GOP ballot. Filing their appeal Wednesday automatically triggered the stay the Colorado Supreme Court outlined in their ruling last week. Colorado's four-justice majority stayed the ruling until Jan. 4, 2024, if their decision was appealed, saying it would maintain the status quo pending any review from the Supreme Court before Jan. 5, 2024, the date the GOP ballot needs to be certified by.",

    "title": "Antipolo’s Mystical Cave, where you can find faith in stalagmites",
    "text": "SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. MANILA, Philippines – Climb a hundred steps up a mountain in Antipolo City, clamber down a musty cave entrance, and you might just see something miraculous. There, with a dose of imagination, you will find what locals say are holy images – stalagmites and stalactites formed over hundreds of years into shapes resembling the Pietà, the Visitation, and even the very face of Jesus Christ. For Antipoleños, faith is formed even in the most unexpected places. As the legend goes, Inday Nelly Deles uncovered the Mystical Cave more than 50 years ago. Some say she hailed from Iloilo, while others say she came from Binondo, Manila. One thing was clear: Inday Nelly was not from Antipolo. But there she went in the 1970s, taking to the tall mountains, guided by visions and voices, in search of a cave that came to her in recurring dreams. “Noong natuklasan po ito ni Inday Nelly Deles, para lang po butas na limang-piso. Butas lang po talaga na bilog. Sobrang lakas po ‘yung buga nung hangin. Doon niya po napatunayan na totoo nga po pala ‘yung panaginip niya,” Rizen Quililan, a local tour guide, told Rappler. (When Inday Nelly Deles found this, the hole was just the size of a five-peso coin. It was just a circular hole. But air was rushing out of that hole strongly. That’s how she proved that her dream really was true.) According to Rizen, Inday Nelly explored the eight-story cave for years, saying she descended to its depths without so much as a flashlight. In the deepest parts of the caves, where few visitors dare go, the floor is slick with mud, and the passageways are so tight that you must crawl on all fours to fit through. Mystical images In the 1980s, priests were said to have visited the cave, where they were awed by the “unnatural” formations inside. Deep in the candlelit cave, they held a Mass in front of a multicolumn stalagmite formation called “The Altar.” “Na-found out ng mga pari na hindi natural ‘yung mga nasa paligid. May mga nakikita silang mga imahe,” Rizen told Rappler. (The priests found out that what was around here was not natural. They saw some images.) Later on, in the 1990s, the cave was opened to the public. Devotees and tourists alike have since walked alongside its mystical walls, with people flocking to the area particularly on Good Friday. Rizen, the 22-year-old guide who started out when he was just 17, now takes pride in helping visitors appreciate and see the formations, some of which could be easily missed if you don’t know where to look. “Ito na po pinakapanata ko tuwing Mahal na Araw,” Rizen told Rappler. “Nahiwagaan din ako mismo eh. Sabi ko, hindi naman talaga natural ‘yung mga nakikita. Why not i-try ko na i-share din? Para at least ‘yung mga turista, mas ma-appreciate nila,” he told Rappler. (This is my devotion every Holy Week. I myself found it enigmatic. I said, what I’m seeing is really not natural. Why don’t I try to share this to others? That way, at least the tourists can appreciate it too.) Rizen said there are also visitors who believe that the cave’s water, which drips from the ceiling, is blessed. During the rainy season, water fills and overflows from a natural stone basin in the cave, which locals call the “Bath Tub.” Some dip their handkerchiefs in the water. Others drink it. Besides its religious mysteries, the cave hides other secrets. Rizen pointed out a steep hole along a corner of the cave, dubbed the “Wishing Well,” where visitors can cast coins. Throughout the years, nobody, Rizen said, has ever dared scale down to retrieve the coins. There is also “The Bell,” a part of the wall that juts out and seems to be made of a different kind of rock. When struck with an open palm, it shudders with the sound of tolling bells that echo in the cave. Rizen has a curious story about “The Bell.” Some years ago, a tourist was said to have shattered and stolen a part of the rocky wall, taking it as a souvenir. “The Bell” was left with a huge, jagged scar along its side. But just days later, the thief came hurrying back to return the stolen fragment, fearing a curse that seemed to have followed him since. “Ibinalik niya ‘yung binasag niya. Sabi po kasi niya, simula raw po noong ginawa niya ‘yon, puro kamalasan na po ang nangyari sa kanya,” Rizen told Rappler – just another of the cave’s many mysteries. (He gave back the part that he broke off. According to him, ever since he did that, he’s been faced with misfortune.) The Mystical Cave is located in Puting Bato, Barangay San Jose, Antipolo. It is open until midnight on Good Friday, March 29, and from 6 am to 6 pm on Black Saturday, March 30, and Easter Sunday, March 31. – Rappler.com Add a comment There are no comments yet.
