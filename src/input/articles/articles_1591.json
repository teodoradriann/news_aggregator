    "title": "Do opinion polls matter? – The Island",
    "text": "By Dr Upul Wijayawardhana\nThe colossal failure of not a single opinion poll predicting accurately the result of the Indian parliamentary election, the greatest exercise in democracy in the world, raises the question whether the importance of opinion polls is vastly exaggerated. During elections two types of opinion polls are conducted; one based on intentions to vote, published during or before the campaign, often being not very accurate as these are subject to many variables but exit polls, done after the voting where a sample tally of how the voters actually voted, are mostly accurate. However, of the 15 exit polls published soon after all the votes were cast in the massive Indian election, 13 vastly overpredicted the number of seats Modi’s BJP led coalition NDA would obtain, some giving a figure as high as 400, the number Modi claimed he is aiming for. The other two polls grossly underestimated predicting a hung parliament. The actual result is that NDA passed the threshold of 272 comfortably, there being no landslide. BJP by itself was not able to cross the threshold, a significant setback for an overconfident Mody! Whether this would result in less excesses on the part of Modi, like Muslim-bashing, remains to be seen. Anyway, the statement issued by BJP that they would be investigating the reasons for failure rather than blaming the process speaks very highly of the maturity of the democratic process in India.\nI was intrigued by this failure of opinion polls as this differs dramatically from opinion polls in the UK. I never failed to watch ‘Election night specials’ on BBC; as the Big Ben strikes ‘ten’ (In the UK polls close at 10pm} the anchor comes out with “Exit polls predict that …” and the actual outcome is often almost as predicted. However, many a time opinion polls conducted during the campaign have got the predictions wrong. There are many explanations for this.\nAn opinion poll is defined as a research survey of public opinion from a particular sample, the origin of which can be traced back to the 1824 US presidential election, when two local newspapers in North Carolina and Delaware predicted the victory of Andrew Jackson but the sample was local. First national survey was done in 1916 by the magazine, Literary Digest, partly for circulation-raising, by mailing millions of postcards and counting the returns. Of course, this was not very scientific though it accurately predicted the election of Woodrow Wilson.\nSince then, opinion polls have grown in extent and complexity with scientific methodology improving the outcome of predictions not only in elections but also in market research. As a result, some of these organisations have become big businesses. For instance, YouGov, an internet-based organisation co-founded by the Iraqi-born British politician Nadim Zahawi, based in London had a revenue of 258 million GBP in 2023.\nIn Sri Lanka, opinion polls seem to be conducted by only one organisation which, by itself, is a disadvantage, as pooled data from surveys conducted by many are more likely to reflect the true situation. Irrespective of the degree of accuracy, politicians seem to be dependent on the available data which lend explanations to the behaviour of some.\nThe Institute for Health Policy’s (IHP) Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey has been tracking the voting intentions for the likely candidates for the Presidential election. At one stage the NPP/JVP leader AKD was getting a figure over 50%. This together with some degree of international acceptance made the JVP behave as if they are already in power, leading to some incidents where their true colour was showing.\nThe comments made by a prominent member of the JVP who claimed that the JVP killed only the riff-raff, raised many questions, in addition to being a total insult to many innocents killed by them including my uncle. Do they have the authority to do so? Do extra-judicial killings continue to be JVP policy? Do they consider anyone who disagrees with them riff-raff? Will they kill them simply because they do not comply like one of my admired teachers, Dr Gladys Jayawardena who was considered riff-raff because she, as the Chairman of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation, arranged to buy drugs cheaper from India? Is it not the height of hypocrisy that AKD is now boasting of his ties to India?\nAnother big-wig comes with the grand idea of devolving law and order to village level. As stated very strongly, in the editorial “Pledges and reality” ( The Island , 20 May) is this what they intend to do: Have JVP kangaroo-courts!\nPerhaps, as a result of these incidents AKD’s ratings has dropped to 39%, according to the IHP survey done in April, and Sajith Premadasa’s ratings have increased gradually to match that. Whilst they are level pegging Ranil is far behind at 13%. Is this the reason why Ranil is getting his acolytes to propagate the idea that the best for the country is to extend his tenure by a referendum? He forced the postponement of Local Governments elections by refusing to release funds but he cannot do so for the presidential election for constitutional reasons. He is now looking for loopholes. Has he considered the distinct possibility that the referendum to extend the life of the presidency and the parliament if lost, would double the expenditure?\nUnfortunately, this has been an exercise in futility and it would not be surprising if the next survey shows Ranil’s chances dropping even further! Perhaps, the best option available to Ranil is to retire gracefully, taking credit for steadying the economy and saving the country from an anarchic invasion of the parliament, rather than to leave politics in disgrace by coming third in the presidential election. Unless, of course, he is convinced that opinion polls do not matter and what matters is the ballots in the box!\nAll News Advertisement",

    "title": "Climate Change Impact On Water Security In South Asia – OpEd",
    "text": "According to Jeff Nesbit, founder of climate combating organization “Climate Nexus”, a nuclear country, facing some serious water scarcity issues that would be very dangerous.”\nWater is a severe and volatile concern in South Asia, and the need for water for various purposes has enhanced its importance. In such a severe way, Climate change (unpredictable rainfall patterns) causes flash floods and droughts, water scarcity, and glaciers melting in the regions.\nDue to climate change, the intensity of fluvial (river) and pluvial (rain) floods has increased. According to a report published by a scientific African journal in 2022 , over the past 60 years, Pakistan has faced a total of 19 major flood events, of which 594,700 km of land and 166,075 villages were affected, causing a loss of 30 billion dollars and 10668 deaths. The 2010 and 2012 floods were devastating.\nThe aftermath of climate change will further impact the availability and quality of water in South Asia. Water availability is not the sole issue in South Asia; it is worldwide. According to the McKinsey report , it is estimated that by 2030, only 60% of the global population will use fresh water, while 40% of the world’s population of 3 billion will not have access to fresh water supplies. In that scenario, 70 percent of the water will be used for agriculture. Here is the question of whether this demand can escalate the water war because, by 2030, the world population will cross 8.3 billion. Therefore, climate change will likely impact water security in volatile regions across the globe.\nIn such a way, Climate change primarily affects water through unpredictable rainfall patterns that have further consequences for melting glaciers and shrinking ice sheets, rising sea levels, floods, droughts, etc. According to the SDG Report 2022 , around 2 billion people need access to safe drinking water, and only 0.5% is usable. Over the past 20 years, water in the form of snow, ice, and soil moisture has declined by 1 cm per year. So, here is a simple question: is South Asia facing severe water security issues?\nAs reports from the UN Water Conference 2023 added, 90% of disasters are water-related, and climate is acting as a flare. South Asia, one of the most populous regions and home to one-fourth of the world’s population, is prone to climate change. Because the water table is decreasing with the increasing urban population, according to the UN Department of Economic, social affair and Population Division Report 2019, the ratio of India (10.5 million), Pakistan (2.05 million), and Bangladesh (1.85 million) per year, this further add up in water scarcity issue.\nAbout half of India’s population will suffer from an acute water shortage by 2030. Research conducted by ORF suggested that India’s per capita water availability dropped from 1986 cubic meters (cu m) in 1998 to 1731 cu m in 2005, bringing the nation almost under the declaration of a water shortage.\nPakistan’s circumstances are not much different either. For instance, per capita water availability in 1951 was 5260; in 2016, it dropped to 1017. Furthermore, Climate change also flares up the melting of glaciers.\nThe Hindu Kush mountain range, home to around 54000 glaciers, is melting. That is causing a severe threat to India and Pakistan through flash flooding at the start and droughts at the end. These glaciers have been melting at a high rate since 2010. It is melting at a pace of 65%. According to a global risk report since the 1970s, this will impact agriculture production because this sector accounts for 90% of water, and the climate change impact will reduce the yield of crops from 4 to 10 % by 2050, a direct threat to food security.\nBoth India and Pakistan rely on irrigation as agricultural societies. However, India’s irrigation efficiency is around 38%, while Pakistan’s is 40 %; in such circumstances, storage of water plays a key role.\nThe Relationship between India and Pakistan is primarily because of water, as they share the Indus Basin water, which originates from the Himalayas and Hindukush mountains. Both countries also signed the Indian water treaty because their boundaries cut most of the water streams with the help of the World Bank in 1960. Still, India built a Krishan Ganga dam as an upper riparian against climate change. India is building this dam on the upper stream of Bonar Nalla, which is located in Indian-administered Kashmir. India believes that building this dam would fulfill its electricity needs. In 2013, Pakistan filed a case against India in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, claiming that this project would cut down the natural water flow by 27%. So the question arises: will there be a water war between Pakistan and India?\nAlthough climate change has not been directly linked with war or conflict, senior politician and opposition leader, Sherry Rehman said during a Senate address that “the issue of water security has become a severe security threat in South Asia.\nAccording to the IMF 2018 report , Pakistan would be third no in the water stress country list, so it may flare up the conflict as tension over the Helmand River is now being escalated between Iran and Afghanistan during 2022-2023.\nIn South Asia, the declining rivers will be cut much more and reflect the fast melting glaciers in the Himalayas, which supply the Indus waters and are finally disappearing as expected. India almost brought the IWT down in 2016. It attributed September of that year’s attack on Indian army forces in occupied Kashmir to Pakistani militants. Said to have the potential to become the most lethal climate change-attributed conflict in the world, in 2018, Jeff Nesbit said, “This is the Way the World Ends,” addressing in part the water issues between Pakistan and India.\nIn 2019, when DW interviewed Jeff Nesbit, the founder of Climate Nexus , they asked why India has still not abrogated the IWT. He replied that one thing that is preventing India from acting on threats to restrict Pakistan’s access to Indian waters is China because it is even further upstream. If China were to look to its borders near India and act as likely as India acting and behaving with Pakistan, it would have a similar effect on India.\nIn conclusion, both countries -India and Pakistan—need to understand the seriousness of Climate change. Along with this, the Indus Water Treaty should be advanced. Not just this treaty, Pakistan and India should also form a climate-fighting organization on a regional level, like the Asia Pacific Adaptation Network, that solely aims to solve the issue related to water-related conflict.",
