    "title": "NASA: Life Signs Could Survive Near Surfaces Of Enceladus And Europa",
    "text": "Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, have evidence of oceans beneath their ice crusts. A NASA experiment suggests that if these oceans support life, signatures of that life in the form of organic molecules (e.g. amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.) could survive just under the surface ice despite the harsh radiation on these worlds. If robotic landers are sent to these moons to look for life signs, they would not have to dig very deep to find amino acids that have survived being altered or destroyed by radiation.\n“Based on our experiments, the ‘safe’ sampling depth for amino acids on Europa is almost 8 inches (around 20 centimeters) at high latitudes of the trailing hemisphere (hemisphere opposite to the direction of Europa’s motion around Jupiter) in the area where the surface hasn’t been disturbed much by meteorite impacts,” said Alexander Pavlov of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, lead author of a paper on the research published July 18 in Astrobiology. “Subsurface sampling is not required for the detection of amino acids on Enceladus – these molecules will survive radiolysis (breakdown by radiation) at any location on the Enceladus surface less than a tenth of an inch (under a few millimeters) from the surface.”\nThe frigid surfaces of these nearly airless moons are likely uninhabitable due to radiation from both high-speed particles trapped in their host planet’s magnetic fields and powerful events in deep space, such as exploding stars. However, both have oceans under their icy surfaces that are heated by tides from the gravitational pull of the host planet and neighboring moons. These subsurface oceans could harbor life if they have other necessities, such as an energy supply as well as elements and compounds used in biological molecules.\nThe research team used amino acids in radiolysis experiments as possible representatives of biomolecules on icy moons. Amino acids can be created by life or by non-biological chemistry. However, finding certain kinds of amino acids on Europa or Enceladus would be a potential sign of life because they are used by terrestrial life as a component to build proteins. Proteins are essential to life as they are used to make enzymes which speed up or regulate chemical reactions and to make structures. Amino acids and other compounds from subsurface oceans could be brought to the surface by geyser activity or the slow churning motion of the ice crust.\nTo evaluate the survival of amino acids on these worlds, the team mixed samples of amino acids with ice chilled to about minus 321 Fahrenheit (-196 Celsius) in sealed, airless vials and bombarded them with gamma-rays, a type of high-energy light, at various doses. Since the oceans might host microscopic life, they also tested the survival of amino acids in dead bacteria in ice. Finally, they tested samples of amino acids in ice mixed with silicate dust to consider the potential mixing of material from meteorites or the interior with surface ice.\nThe experiments provided pivotal data to determine the rates at which amino acids break down, called radiolysis constants. With these, the team used the age of the ice surface and the radiation environment at Europa and Enceladus to calculate the drilling depth and locations where 10 percent of the amino acids would survive radiolytic destruction.\nAlthough experiments to test the survival of amino acids in ice have been done before, this is the first to use lower radiation doses that don’t completely break apart the amino acids, since just altering or degrading them is enough to make it impossible to determine if they are potential signs of life. This is also the first experiment using Europa/Enceladus conditions to evaluate the survival of these compounds in microorganisms and the first to test the survival of amino acids mixed with dust.\nThe team found that amino acids degraded faster when mixed with dust but slower when coming from microorganisms.\n“Slow rates of amino acid destruction in biological samples under Europa and Enceladus-like surface conditions bolster the case for future life-detection measurements by Europa and Enceladus lander missions,” said Pavlov. “Our results indicate that the rates of potential organic biomolecules’ degradation in silica-rich regions on both Europa and Enceladus are higher than in pure ice and, thus, possible future missions to Europa and Enceladus should be cautious in sampling silica-rich locations on both icy moons.”\nA potential explanation for why amino acids survived longer in bacteria involves the ways ionizing radiation changes molecules — directly by breaking their chemical bonds or indirectly by creating reactive compounds nearby which then alter or break down the molecule of interest. It’s possible that bacterial cellular material protected amino acids from the reactive compounds produced by the radiation.",

    "title": "Women feel 'invisible' at a shockingly low age - study reveals why they blame fashion",
    "text": "They’re not feeling seen while strutting their stuff on the scene.\nInvisibility — it’s the curse of being a wannabe glamor gal in her mid-30s or older, per a new study that found the fashion world makes women feel “invisible” by age 36.\n“This research sheds light on the challenges many women face as they age, including feeling overlooked in various areas of life,” Simon Barnett, director of age-inclusive clothes retailer Klass, said in a statement .\n5 A new poll found that women as young as age 36 feel “invisible,” owing to a lack of inclusivity in the fashion industry. fizkes – stock.adobe.com The UK-based imprint commissioned a survey via OnePoll to find that 75% of women feel mainstream designers and outlets prioritize younger demographics, leaving older ladies feeling underserved, overlooked and unacknowledged.\n“It’s clear that societal attitudes toward aging — particularly for women — play a significant role in these experiences,” said Barnett.\nExplore More Woman facing trial over allegedly threatening 'Don't be a c–t' bumper sticker My friend demands to stay the night at my house — how do I kick her out? Zoogoers appalled as dogs painted to look like tigers in ridiculous 'gimmick' “It’s a shame to see that a recent phenomenon called ‘Invisible Women Syndrome’ does seem to exist.”\nIt’s a phenomenon whereby women of a certain age are “dismissed or devalued in some way,” says psychologist Kirstin Bouse .\n5 Online, women in their teens and early twenties have suggested ending their lives by age 22 to avoid the societal ostracism that often comes with aging. AntonioDiaz – stock.adobe.com And Gen Z girls as young as 18 are already beginning to dread the age-related snub, fearing that society will automatically deem them “unattractive hags” by their 30th birthdays.\nBut the not-so-hot shunning inspired New York couturier Batsheva Hay, 42, to debut a clothing line geared towards celebrating the members of her gender in all phases of life.\n“I feel like as I’m growing and evolving, the fashion industry isn’t necessarily loving women who are aging,” she previously told The Post , adding that being shut out by style tastemakers gave her the space to create her own lane.\n“One of the things about being forgotten or invisible is that you can also just do whatever you want,” said Hay, who only cast models over age 40, including actress Molly Ringwald, in her 2024 New York Fashion Week show last February. “And, so, it’s kind of fun, actually.”\n5 While some women have learned to embrace their age, others struggle to feel seen in a world that prioritizes youthfulness. Vladimir Borovic – stock.adobe.com Unfortunately, the average belle over age 35 seems to find it hard to find the fun in being ignored, per the Klass poll.\nA staggering 45% of women admitted to feeling unnoticed in social settings, while 24% and 23% said they were disregarded due to their ages at work and by the healthcare system, respectively.\nApproximately 39% copped to feeling invisible after struggling to find clothing that caters to them as they get older, and 37% attribute that exclusion to changes in their appearance.\nA majority (62%) of survey respondents agreed that societal beauty standards are to blame for making women feel invisible, with 57% blasting the media for failing to spotlight the sex appeal of millennials and up.\n5 Many of the female respondents argue that mainstream media often forgets to acknowledge aging women. Andrey Popov – stock.adobe.com And in the workplace, 29% of those aged 40 and over said they’ve felt less visible since entering this decade, and 60% believe their opinions are often dismissed due to age.\n“The findings highlight the need for greater inclusivity in fashion and beyond,” said Lynne McKenna, a celebrity stylist and Klass ambassador. “Women want to feel confident and represented, no matter their age or life stage.”\n5 McKenna offered tips and tricks for looking and feeling your best in the face of ageism. Victoria Fox – stock.adobe.com “Women in this period of their lives should feel at the height of their fabulousness and confidence, not invisible,” she said, advising seasoned smoke-shows to wear, “what makes you happy and avoid the pressures of dancing to the drum beat of trends.”\nMcKenna’s tips for looking and feeling good — regardless of your birth year: Confidence is key: The most important style tip is to wear what’s comfortable and makes you feel good about yourself. Invest in quality: Well-made clothes will last longer and make you feel more polished. Be colorful: A pop of color can instantly brighten your look and make you feel more vibrant. Invest in fit: Select styles that suit and fit you well over chasing the latest fashion trends. It will help you emulate confidence. Accessorise: Be rebellious with everything from jewelry to scarves and handbags. They add mystique to any outfit. Update your hairstyle: Who said you can’t go peroxide blond? A fresh cut and color can do wonders. Pay attention to details : A well-tailored jacket or a perfectly ironed shirt can make a big difference. Have fun: Remember, style is an expression of your personality. Enjoy celebrating “you.”",
