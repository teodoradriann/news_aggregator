    "text": "ANKENY, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis slammed opponent Nikki Haley for giving \"a really incomprehensible word salad\" answer when she was asked in New Hampshire what caused the Civil War. During a Wednesday town hall in Berlin, New Hampshire, a voter asked Haley, “What was the cause of the United States Civil War?”\n“Well, don’t come with an easy question or anything,\" Haley responded. \"I mean, I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how the government was going to run. The freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do.”\nHaley never mentioned slavery in her answer, drawing backlash from her Republican and Democratic rivals. On Thursday, Haley said \"of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" and she suggested the question came from a Democratic plant in the audience.\nMore: 'The cause of the Civil War was slavery': Historian weighs in on Nikki Haley's answer\nDeSantis was quick to criticize Haley at an Ankeny campaign stop Thursday morning. He told reporters she is \"not a candidate that's ready for prime time.\"\n\"The minute that she faces any kind of scrutiny, she tends to cave,\" DeSantis said. \"I think that that's what you saw yesterday. Not that difficult to identify and acknowledge the role slavery played in the Civil War, and yet that seemed to be something that was really difficult.\"\nDeSantis claimed the abolition of slavery was a \"partisan achievement.\"\n\"The Republican Party was founded to put a stop to the growth of slavery in this country. And the abolition of slavery was — and to this day, remains — the party's top achievement,\" he said.\nBut DeSantis faced his own gauntlet of questions about slavery and the legacy of the Civil War.\nA reporter asked about a curriculum standard approved in Florida that \"includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\" The language earned Florida and DeSantis scorn, including from U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, who at the time was a presidential candidate before later dropping out.\nDeSantis cut off the reporter's question about the standard: \"That's a fake narrative,\" he said. \"We've now had a whole semester that's happened. Have you seen examples of (teachers) saying what the media was saying this summer? No.\"\nDeSantis said the standard was \"bastardized\" intentionally to \"create a narrative.\"\n\"Florida's standards were written largely by African-Americans, and they were accurate, and any of those narratives are false,\" he said.\nAnother reporter asked DeSantis to comment on Jacksonville, Florida, Mayor Donna Deegan's removal of a Confederate monument.\n\"I'm opposed to taking down statues,\" DeSantis said. \"The idea that we're going to just erase history is wrong.\"\nUSA Today contributed reporting.\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

    "title": "The US' position of strength is its real weakness - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "[Ten photos from across China: Dec 22 - 28](/a/202312/29/WS658df937a31040ac301aa03b.html) The US' position of strength is its real weakness By Chen Weihua | China Daily | Updated: 2023-12-29 06:39 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken seems to have a short memory because he claimed at a news conference on Dec 20 that \"we will continue to engage with China from a position of strength\" and boasted about the United States' alliances in the region while claiming that China was a threat to peace and stability. Blinken appears to have forgotten how he was rebutted in Anchorage, Alaska, in March 2021, by Yang Jiechi, then top Chinese diplomat, that \"the US does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength\". Yang's rebuttal became so popular that it appeared on many merchandises, from T-shirts to phone back covers sold on e-commerce platforms. Chinese people are fed up of the condescending tone used by US politicians against China. That the US is extremely lonely as a permanent UN Security Council member and does not appear to occupy a position of strength becomes clear when you see how repeatedly it has vetoed resolutions for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Even its allies in Europe have not sided with it on this issue. The US' reputation has taken a beating, as the whole world, especially the Global South, has witnessed its hypocrisy on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Even US diplomats warned US President Joe Biden that \"we are losing support of Arabs for a generation\" by blindly supporting Israel. Speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington on Dec 15, US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns blamed Beijing for not using its influence in the Middle East to end the Israel-Palestine conflict. By doing so, he deliberately turned a blind eye to the hectic diplomatic efforts by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and China's permanent representative to the UN Zhang Jun. The truth is that the US has been providing military support for Israel and has endorsed its repeated bombings of Gaza, which have claimed the lives of more than 21,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and caused a horrible humanitarian crisis. While top United Nations officials, from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have not mentioned the US by name, their outrage over US policy cannot be more obvious. Gaza, however, is just one of the low points of US foreign policy. Its 20-year war in (and occupancy of) Afghanistan ended with the takeover of the country by the Taliban, which former US president George W. Bush had overthrown in 2001. The Iraq War, the regime change in Libya, the \"color revolutions\" in Central Asia and the \"Arab Spring\" in the Middle East... the list of US foreign policy disasters is long. Perhaps, to some US officials, the hundreds of US military bases around China is a sign of the US' strength which in turn enables it to bully China, as Burns tried to do when he bragged about the US' access to nine military bases in the Philippines. But there is no reason to believe the US has the right to gang up against and bully China, because the US is the biggest threat to global peace and stability. The US' accusation that China poses a threat to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait is laughable because safe shipping lanes in the two waters matter more to China than the US, or any other country. Even the US president is not in a position of strength. Biden's dismal approval rating of 39 percent in 2023 is the worst among eight US presidents since Jimmy Carter. Burns blindly accused China of severing contacts between the US and Chinese governments. But he seems to have forgotten that it was former US president Donald Trump who terminated the 90 high-level dialogue and exchange mechanisms, a policy that Biden has not reversed. It's easy for Burns to blame Chinese news media outlets for distorting US politics and society. But he knows full well that the US is once again in the grip of McCarthyism, and the farce of China bashing will likely climax during the 2024 US presidential campaign. The problem with Washington's \"position of strength\" is that the US never treats any other country as an equal, not China, not Africa, not Asia, and not Europe. That is its real weakness.

    "title": "Elon Musk Tried to Board the Trump Bus But Got Run Over Instead",
    "text": "No one has tarnished their reputation in service of Donald Trump quite like Elon Musk. Musk began shedding his image as a benevolent billionaire when he purchased Twitter, transforming it into a platform more aligned with the alt-right. His recent conversation with Trump, which took place on Monday, has made this transformation even more pronounced. The persona of Musk as a champion of humanity and free speech has seemingly vanished, replaced by the image of someone who is willing to debase himself in the political arena for the sake of wealth.\nMusk is not the only wealthy individual to have been swept up by Trump. Many billionaires have contributed massive amounts to Trump’s campaigns. However, they often do not allow themselves to be publicly belittled by him. Those who enter Trump’s orbit, often seeking some form of collaboration or recognition, tend to find themselves diminished. Musk, perhaps, has taken the initiative to avoid such degradation. After observing Trump’s pattern of overpowering others, it seems Musk mistakenly believed he could engage with Trump on friendly terms.\nDuring the introduction of Trump on X, Musk claimed he sought to give Americans a chance to know the former president better—an assertion that disregards Trump’s long-standing presence in the political landscape. Year after year, Trump has maintained a visible role, making it hard to believe that anyone would need a fresh perspective on him. Furthermore, Musk posited that the conversation would offer Trump a “safe environment” to speak, as though Trump didn’t regularly hold two-hour, free-form rallies.\nIn 2015, many may have been curious about Trump’s values, but nearly a decade later, it’s safe to say that Americans are well aware of where he stands. Even other supporters of Trump’s campaign have expressed confusion over why they are funding a candidate who is already so well-defined. Enter Musk, who approaches politics with a reckless disregard reminiscent of crypto enthusiasts, attempting to redefine a space that has already been firmly established.\nThe execution of Musk’s event was riddled with technical failures, delaying the conversation with Trump for 45 minutes. When the discussion finally began, Musk’s reputation faced serious harm. Throughout the two-hour, seven-minute conversation, Trump repeatedly trampled on Musk’s core values, which Musk has claimed to uphold. When Trump minimized the climate crisis, suggesting it had positive aspects—such as more oceanfront properties—Musk offered a meek “OK.” You would expect someone who has previously advocated for climate action to challenge such ideas. However, Musk instead cautioned listeners against demonizing the oil and gas industries and suggested that the climate issue could wait.\nAfter enduring around an hour and a half of Trump’s rants, Musk finally ventured a weak defense of climate reality. He found himself outmatched through the conversation, which led him into bizarre tangents where he praised Trump for allowing press freedom during his presidential term—implying a president grants such rights at his discretion. Musk’s remarks revealed his erratic positions, including a newfound support for nuclear energy, justified with a confusing analogy about the resilience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after their bombings. Trump, appearing indifferent, simply responded with boredom.\nThe discussion seemed geared towards Musk seeking Trump’s endorsement for deregulation policies that would favor his businesses while retaining substantial government subsidies. Musk has been candid about his desire to dismantle climate regulations that could incentivize large automakers to produce electric vehicles, thereby solidifying Tesla’s market dominance. Yet, when Musk attempted to draw Trump’s endorsement for his agenda during the talk, he faced a disregard that highlighted his powerlessness.\nThis appearance did not reflect the type of influential presence one would expect from someone who claims to prioritize saving humanity. Musk’s detached intellectualism has now reached a wider audience thanks to his alliance with Trump. His values, when aligned with policy, equate to supporting a candidate who disdains a free press and champions resource extraction. Musk, who once spoke urgently about the climate crisis, appears to have shifted his priorities when aligning himself with Trump. While many affluent individuals supporting Trump do so out of clear self-interest, Musk’s motivations have now come under scrutiny, leading observers to question if he ever truly diverged from that path.\nFurther complicating matters, Musk’s attempts to enter political activism have also faltered, reflected in his efforts to establish a super PAC aimed at registering new voters to support Trump. Reports indicate these initiatives are failing to gain traction. The PAC, which Musk envisioned would facilitate the registration of 800,000 voters, now appears ineffective, with reports suggesting it has not even mailed out registration forms.\nMusk’s previous lapses in judgment have also left him open to ridicule. His recent controversies highlight the shortcomings of someone who possesses immense wealth but lacks the ability to wield real political influence. This performance in the political arena contrasts starkly with the image of a powerful billionaire striving for social and economic change. In an era where he engages with significant figures like Maduro, his influence seems diminished rather than amplified. Ultimately, Musk’s recent activities reveal a troubling juxtaposition: despite his wealth and aspirations, true political power continues to elude him.\nSource: Business Insider",

    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Anambra State ICT Agency, Mr. Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata , has attributed his success story in the management and advancement of technological initiatives and innovations in Anambra to journalists. Agbata in a press statement personally signed by him, noted that his partnership and collaborations with journalists in the state made it possible for him to succeed as well as excel greatly in his assignment as the MD/CEO of the state ICT agency. He said that the role of journalists as moral compass of the society can not be overemphasized, hence the society relies heavily on their functions as agenda setters to inform and enlighten the people on public policy, which he said, was where the ICT agency leveraged on to showcase her activities to Ndi-Anambra. While expressing profound gratitude and deep appreciation to journalists for the robust synergy and coverage of his programmes and activities from inception as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency, Agbata equally thanked Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, who provided the enabling environment for him to prove his mettle as a tech expert. His press statement reads, ” I am writing to express my deepest appreciation for your continued support and coverage of Anambra State’s innovative ICT initiatives and the transformative work happening under the visionary leadership of Governor Charles Soludo. Your reporting on Anambra State’s technological advancements is much more than just news coverage – it serves as a beacon, illuminating the incredible journey the state is on. Your dedication to showcasing the positive impact of ICT aligns perfectly with Governor Soludo’s vision for a progressive and technologically advanced Anambra. Your work is a shining example of the power of journalism to inform and inspire. As our world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, your role as a journalist is more important than ever. By telling the stories of Anambra State’s ICT initiatives, you are bridging the gap between the Agency and the people it serves. Your coverage helps us all understand and engage with the transformative work that is happening. As we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, we want to thank you for your indispensable role in helping us share, celebrate, and inform the public about these exciting developments. I am honored to have you as a partner on this journey, and look forward to continuing to work together to promote the continued growth and success of ICT in Anambra State. Thank you again for all you do, I am grateful for your efforts in championing the advancement we are making.”",
