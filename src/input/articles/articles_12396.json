    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nAl final el gobierno frankenstein, el que iba a reventar por un lado u otro, ahí sigue. Y mientras el PP teniendo que lidiar con una panda de paletos vociferantes como aliados, y ahora además con una escisión aún más paleta y aún más vociferante.\nPues voy a hacer de abogado del diablo. Lo primero de todo es que avisaron de salirse de los gobiernos si se cumplía lo del reparto de menores...y han cumplido. Seguramente si hubieran reculado ya estaríamos con el mantra de los sillones y las poltronas.\nSe está celebrando el reparto, cuando seguimos sin atajar el problema. Muchos de ellos no son menores, no tenemos información alguna suya previa y por mucho que digamos donde deberían estar es con sus familias.\nSupongo que desde la perspectiva de la \"izquierda\" esto es una fiesta. Pero no todo el mundo piensa igual y esto es un problema que ni los políticos de izquierda o derecha se van a comer en sus barrios y casas.\nLuego vendrán los sesudos análisis del auge de la ultra derecha.\nY bueno, ahora ya podéis tildarme de fascista o lo que os salga de las pelotas por no seguir el ideario estándar de la izquierda.",

    "title": "Washingtonians Could Maybe Kind Of See the Northern Lights Again Tonight",
    "text": "The DC area felt a whole lot like the Westfjords on Thursday night, as the vibrant colors of aurora borealis streaked across skies in the District, Maryland, and Northern Virginia. Perhaps you missed last night’s space weather spectacular, or maybe the display was so awe-inspiring that you just have to see it again. Will tonight bring the possibility of another glimpse at the Northern Lights? [Elizabeth MacDonald](https://science.nasa.gov/people/elizabeth-macdonald/), a space physicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center who specializes in studying auroras, doesn’t want to get your hopes up. “I really do think it’s best to temper expectations, even though I hate to be the bearer of that news,” she tells Washingtonian, who called her, dazzled by last night’s spectacle, in the hopes that she would tell us the Northern Lights will be visible from the DMV again, tonight and every night forever. A few of my favorite Northern Lights photos from Washington DC tonight. They are still active but have dimmed a little. [#northernlights][#AuroraBorealis][#Aurora][pic.twitter.com/RtobPZ44MW]— Jonah Bryson (@JonahLBryson) [October 11, 2024] But while the chances for a showing like yesterday’s are slim, MacDonald says there is some possibility for some auroral action on a smaller scale. “The chance is higher than usual because it was seen last night and because we’re in the recovery of this large storm,” she says. “But the chance is nowhere near as likely as it would be” on a night like Thursday. But if those relatively elevated odds are enough for you—and you’re willing to dedicate your Friday night to the galaxy—here’s what you should do: Get out of the city Light pollution in DC and its immediate suburbs will likely make it difficult to see any Northern Lights activity from your apartment’s balcony. Last night was the “main event” of the geomagnetic storm that sparked what we saw yesterday, according to MacDonald—that’s because the storm was just beginning, and she says that’s “where you see the aurora down as far south as we saw it last night.” Northern lights over Maryland tonight 🤩✨🌄 no filter. [pic.twitter.com/c5nbJem7zy]— Dara T. Mathis (@TrulyTafakari) [October 10, 2024] That storm is now starting to subside, which means so is the probability that we’ll see the lights tonight as vividly as we did Thursday. Still, MacDonald says, “There could still be some aurora seen maybe outside of DC or maybe in the darker areas.” There’s no way to predict exactly where the best local viewing spot is, but MacDonald recommends the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Aurora 30 Minute Forecast](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast) as a tool to help identify the likelihood of visibility in a given area. [Light pollution maps](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=4.00&lat=45.8720&lon=14.5470&state=eyJiYXNlbWFwIjoiTGF5ZXJCaW5nUm9hZCIsIm92ZXJsYXkiOiJ3YV8yMDE1Iiwib3ZlcmxheWNvbG9yIjpmYWxzZSwib3ZlcmxheW9wYWNpdHkiOjYwLCJmZWF0dXJlc29wYWNpdHkiOjg1fQ==) are another resource to consult. Clear your schedule Last night, the Northern Lights were visible to the naked eye just about [as soon as the sun went down](https://x.com/capitalweather/status/1844519269582954732). Since the solar storm is dying down, such an early appearance is not as likely. “Most of the time, when you’re going to be able to see aurora is mostly around midnight, because around midnight is when your location on Earth is going to rotate kind of closest to where the aurora is—which is generally an oval shape, a ring shape, around the Pole,” MacDonald says. Northern lights in Northern Virginia! Incredible sight [#ShotOniPhone][pic.twitter.com/HtAXR4XUqI]— Rohan Tandon (@lucidstarfield) [October 11, 2024] So your odds of seeing aurora “would probably maximize around midnight.” But, according to MacDonald, space weather experts did notice some red lights last night, which could be a promising sign. “That can be an unusual kind of ring called the SAR arc that is seen further south than the usual aurora,” she says. “There is some chance that that continues, and so there’s some chance that there’s a weak red visible, and that could be visible earlier in the night potentially.” Pack a camera If you do decide to gamble on chasing the Northern Lights tonight, MacDonald advises that you bring some sort of camera along—and a smartphone will work just fine. “Cameras are better sensors than our eyes to color at night, so there is some chance that it could be visible just on the camera,” she says.

If you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice@slackinc.com .\nBack to Healio Key takeaways: Vitamin K 2 markedly reduced the mean weekly frequency of nocturnal leg cramps in the intervention group. The vitamin also reduced duration a of cramps while showing no adverse effects. Vitamin K 2 reduced the frequency, intensity and duration of nocturnal leg cramps in older -adults, findings from randomized study published in JAMA Internal Medicine showed.\nStudy participants who received vitamin K 2 supplements had markedly fewer episodes of nocturnal leg cramps compared with placebo and no treatment-related adverse effects, researchers noted.\nVitamin K supplements conferred a marked reduction in the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps among older adults. Image: Adobe Stock According to background information from the Cleveland Clinic, 33% of adults over the age of 60 years experience nocturnal leg cramps at least once every 2 months while almost every adult aged 50 years or older will have them at least one time.\n“Given the generally benign characteristics of [nocturnal leg cramps], treatment modality must be both effective and safe, thus minimizing the risk of iatrogenic harm,” Jing Tan, MD, from the Third People’s Hospital of Chengdu in China, and colleagues wrote. “Quinine, which used to be effective in treating [nocturnal leg cramps], is no longer recommended due to its severe adverse effects.”\nA previous study conducted by the researchers showed that vitamin K 2 — a “fat-soluble vitamin involved in carboxylation that also activates several vitamin K dependent proteins” — effectively reduced dialysis-related muscle cramps while demonstrating safety.\nTan and colleagues conducted a multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K 2 supplementation for treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. The study included 199 adults aged 65 years or older who had two or more episodes of nocturnal leg cramps during 2 weeks of screening at one of two medical centers in China. Study participants received daily capsules containing either 180 g of vitamin K 2 or placebo for 8 weeks.\nThe mean number of nocturnal leg cramps per week served as the study’s primary outcome measurement, while secondary outcomes included the duration of nocturnal leg cramps and severity of nocturnal leg cramps, the latter measured with an analog scale ranging from 1 to 10.\nResults showed similar mean weekly frequency of cramps in both the vitamin K 2 group (2.6) and the placebo group (2.71) at baseline.\nThe researchers found that the mean frequency of nocturnal leg cramps in the vitamin K 2 group decreased to 0.96 during the intervention, with a mean frequency in the placebo group of 3.63 (difference = 2.67; 95% CI, 2.86 to 2.49).\n“Notably, cramping frequency was significantly reduced compared with the placebo group, starting from the first week of intervention with vitamin K 2 ,” Tan and colleagues wrote.\nMeanwhile, the vitamin K 2 group had greater decreases in the severity (2.55 vs. 1.24 points) and duration (0.9 vs. 0.32 minutes) of NLCs vs. the placebo group.\nStudy investigators reported that no adverse events related to vitamin K 2 occurred during the study — ultimately showing its safety — but they noted that vitamin K 2 is not recommended for those receiving warfarin therapy due to the vitamin’s potential “to compromise the anticoagulant effectiveness” of the medication, they wrote.\nTan and colleagues acknowledged some study limitations, including the mild severity of nocturnal leg cramps experienced in the participant sample.\nAs such, more clinical trials are warranted “to confirm the efficacy of cramping management and its impact on the quality of life and sleep in patients with [nocturnal leg cramps],” they concluded.\nReferences: Leg cramps.

    "text": "John McEnroe suspects the final entry in Rafael Nadal’s tennis story is looming large, as he looks to follow in the footsteps of his greatest rival with his final appearance.\nNadal has confirmed he will miss this month’s US Open and play next at the Laver Cup in September.\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion hinted after his Olympics exit that he would skip the final major of the year at Flushing Meadows.\nNadal has won the US Open on four occasions but competed there only once since his 2019 triumph after a number of injury struggles in recent years, which has sparked continuous debate over when he will retire.\n“I have decided not to compete at this year’s US Open a place where I have amazing memories,” Nadal posted on his official X page last month.\n“I will miss those electric and special night sessions in NYC at Ashe, but I don’t think I would be able to give my 100 per cent this time.\n“Thanks to all my US fans in particular, will miss you all and will see you another time. Best of luck to all for the always amazing US Open. My next event will be the Laver Cup in Berlin.”\nNadal’s commitment to playing at the Laver Cup next month could raise the prospect of the Spaniard following in the footsteps of great rival and friend Roger Federer by retiring at the Ryder Cup-style event.\nFederer walked away from professional tennis in 2022 after an emotional farewell at the Laver Cup in London, where he played competitively for the last time in a doubles match alongside Nadal.\nA similar outcome for Nadal could be on the cards given his injury struggles in recent years, with McEnroe suggesting the 22-time Grand Slam icon could wave farewell to tennis in Berlin next month.\nRafael Nadal News The 7 players with the highest US Open men’s win percentage: ft. Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer & Rafael Nadal\nUS Open: The 9 greatest men’s singles champions – ranked!\n“It feels like he is going to stop, maybe, at Laver Cup,” said Laver Cup Team World captain McEnroe, who will be a Eurosport analyst at the US Open.\n“Then again, Roger did it at Laver Cup a couple of years ago, so maybe he wants to do it in his own time.\n“He still seems like he has an appetite to play. It seems like he is trying to get the body up to a level where he feels like he can play. Maybe see what he can do at the start of next year?\n“I don’t know and this is a total guess, but Laver Cup could be the end for Rafa.\n“He really loves to play, more than almost anyone I’ve ever seen, but we’ve watched Andy Murray for the last six years trying to get back to that level and it’s hard when your body lets you down.\n“It’s hard to walk way when you still want to play and you look at Murray and he wanted it so bad. It sucks when your body doesn’t cooperate and we will see with Rafa. I’d be a little surprised if he carried on playing.”\nFans across Europe can watch the US Open on Eurosport and Max (excludes Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and Ireland)",

    "title": "How Alprazolam Helps Alleviate the Symptoms of Anxiety and Panic Disorders",
    "text": "Alprazolam, the generic form of Xanax, is one of the most often prescribed drugs for the treatment of anxiety and panic attacks. It is a member of the benzodiazepine drug class, which consists of medications that depress the central nervous system (CNS) in an effort to lessen aberrant brain activity. Although Xanax is well known for its ability to relieve anxiety quickly, like any strong medication, there are a number of possible hazards and advantages associated with using it, particularly at larger doses like 1 mg. For safe and informed use, it is essential to comprehend the intended uses, suggested dosages, and possible hazards associated with Xanax 1 mg.\n1. What Is Alprazolam, or Xanax 1 mg? Alprazolam, often known by the brand name Xanax, is a drug that is mostly administered to treat anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and occasionally the temporary treatment of severe stress-related diseases. It is a quick-acting neurotransmitter that acts by amplifying the calming effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In doing so, Xanax helps lessen symptoms including restlessness, panic attacks, and excessive concern.\nWhen someone has severe anxiety or panic disorder and has not reacted well to lower dosages of Xanax, the 2 mg dose is usually recommended. It’s crucial to remember that Xanax 2mg should only be taken exactly as directed by a doctor because abuse or overuse might have detrimental consequences or cause dependency.\n2. Typical Uses for 1 mg of Xanax Two main illnesses for which Xanax is frequently given are panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Its main indications are connected to anxiety management , while it can also be used for other diseases like depression and sleeplessness.\n2.1 Disorder of Generalized Anxiety (GAD) Excessive and ongoing worry about a wide range of life events or activities is a hallmark of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a chronic illness. Physical signs of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) include weariness, tense muscles, and trouble concentrating. For people with severe GAD who need powerful, immediate symptom alleviation, Xanax 1 mg may be administered. The medicine has a relaxing effect and slows down brain activity to assist relieve anxiety.\n2.2 Anxiety Abrupt and recurrent panic episodes, which can induce extreme dread, palpitations, sweating, and dyspnea, are the hallmarks of panic disorder. Xanax 1 mg may be recommended to treat panic attacks that are severe and frequent in order to offer quick relief. Because the medication calms the central nervous system immediately, it is especially helpful in treating acute panic attacks.\n2.3 Additional Applications Xanax 2 mg may occasionally be used off-label to treat illnesses like the following:\nInsomnia: Xanax may be used to induce sleep in people with severe anxiety-related insomnia.\nDepression: Although it is not a stand-alone treatment for depression, Xanax is occasionally recommended to patients who are experiencing both anxiety and depression in addition to antidepressants.\nXanax can be used to treat social anxiety disorder by lessening jitters and panic attacks in social settings.\n3. Xanax 1 mg Dosage and Administration Xanax is available in a range of dosages, the most popular being 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg. In more severe situations, the 1 mg dose—which is among the highest available—is frequently administered. Adhering to a doctor’s dosage instructions is essential because using medication incorrectly might result in dependence or overdosing.\n3.1 Initial Dosage The initial dosage of Xanax for most people is usually less than 1 mg. Initially, 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg given two to three times a day is a typical dosage. Depending on how the patient responds to the drug and how severe their symptoms are, the dosage may be progressively increased.\n3.2 The Upper Limit of Dosage For the treatment of anxiety, a maximum suggested daily dose of 4 mg of Xanax should be taken throughout the day in smaller doses. Some people with panic disorder could need greater doses, however medical professionals will closely monitor and modify these based on each patient’s needs. Patients who require more potent symptom alleviation or who have developed a tolerance to lower dosages may be prescribed the 1 mg dose.\n3.3 How to Take Two Milligrams of Xanax The normal way to take Xanax is orally, and the tablets need to be consumed whole along with water. You can take the drug with or without food. The extended-release tablets should not be broken, chewed, or crushed as this may cause the medication to release all at once, raising the possibility of overdosing or experiencing negative effects.\n3.4 Length of Use Because Xanax can lead to dependence and tolerance, it is typically recommended for brief periods of time only. Higher dosages used over an extended period of time—up to 2 mg—may cause physical dependence, in which case the body needs the drug in order to operate normally. Healthcare professionals will regularly evaluate the patient’s response and keep an eye out for indications of dependence or misuse if long-term treatment is required.\n4. Possible Dangers and Adverse Reactions to Xanax 1 mg Even while Xanax works wonders for treating panic attacks and anxiety , there are hazards involved, particularly when using larger dosages. It’s critical to comprehend the risks and possible negative effects of Xanax 1 mg in order to take it safely.\n4.1 Typical Adverse Reactions Even at lesser doses, Xanax frequently causes the following negative effects:\nXanax is a CNS depressant, which means that it frequently results in drowsiness and sedation. Higher dosages may have a more noticeable effect.\nDizziness: After taking Xanax, a lot of individuals report feeling lightheaded or dizzy, especially when standing up fast.\nMemory Impairment: People who use Xanax may have trouble remembering recent events due to short-term memory impairment.\nFatigue: Some people may have persistent tiredness or sluggishness that interferes with day-to-day activity.\nCoordination Issues: Excessive Xanax dosages can cause problems with motor skills and coordination, which raises the possibility of mishaps or falls.\n4.2 Reliance and Abandonment The possibility of dependence is one of the biggest hazards connected to Xanax 1 mg. Benzodiazepines, such as Xanax, can lead to addiction, particularly when used frequently or in large quantities. When the body gets used to a drug, physical dependence develops, which can cause withdrawal symptoms if the prescription is withdrawn suddenly. Symptoms of withdrawal may include:\nAnxiety and agitation: Rebound anxiety is a typical condition in which anxiety increases in intensity after stopping Xanax.\nInsomnia: Many Xanax users report having trouble falling asleep after stopping the medication.\nTremors and Seizures: In extreme circumstances, stopping Xanax suddenly can result in harmful withdrawal symptoms like seizures.\nHealthcare professionals usually taper the dosage gradually while stopping medicine to reduce the danger of withdrawal.\n4.3 Overdosage Dangers An overdose can result from taking more Xanax than is recommended, particularly 1 mg. The following are signs of an alprazolam overdose:\nConfusion: People may have disorientation or struggle with clear thinking.\nSpeech impairment: Excessive Xanax dosages might cause impairments in speech and movement skills.\nSevere Drowsiness: Severe Xanax overdoses can result in profound drowsiness that can cause unconsciousness.\nRespiratory Depression: Rarely, taking large amounts of Xanax might cause breathing suppression, which could have fatal results.\nAlcohol, opioids, and other CNS depressants should not be taken in combination with Xanax as this greatly raises the risk of overdosing.\n4.4 Effects on Cognition and Emotion Long-term Xanax use can impair cognitive function, especially at high doses like 1 mg. Memory problems, focus problems, and emotional blunting—a state in which a person feels emotionally aloof or less sensitive—may also be experienced by users.\n5. Safe Utilization and Substitutes Even though Xanax 2 mg can be a useful treatment for panic and anxiety disorders, it’s important to take the drug as directed by a doctor and utilize it responsibly. Among the advice for safe usage are:\nObserve Directions Exactly: Take Xanax exactly as directed by your doctor, and never raise the dosage without first talking to one.\nDon’t Drink or Take Other CNS Decoderants: When Xanax is taken with drugs that inhibit the central nervous system, potentially harmful interactions may occur.\nExamine Your Options: Other drugs, such selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be taken into consideration if Xanax is ineffective or has severe negative effects.\nIn summary A powerful drug called alprazolam, or Xanax 1 mg, is used to treat panic and anxiety disorders. Although it provides quick symptom relief, there are hazards associated with it, including as dependence, withdrawal, and possible overdose. In order to make sure that Xanax is taken properly and effectively, taking into account both the advantages and potential adverse effects, patients should collaborate closely with their healthcare practitioners.
