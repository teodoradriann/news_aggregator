    "text": "Learning continues to be an obstacle for nearly a third of students, according to 2023-24 survey data released by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). “In the latest data from the [School Pulse Panel survey](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FJlA4CL90zwFvv9kFBfBu3g7iJ%3Fdomain%3Dt1.info.ed.gov&data=05%7C02%7Cjjackson%40diverseeducation.com%7C984ca66689404b60d03108dcbd3985ac%7C51e0b4f86cf0405f893fc9aa5fc38e0b%7C0%7C0%7C638593301978874062%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=v%2BaOaB03NNxa7Zc8DOe5DnlpRAVqLscD%2BIEBfCoJJ0Q%3D&reserved=0) we are seeing signs of change in the areas of learning recovery and student absences in public schools.” said NCES Commissioner Dr. Peggy G. Carr. NCES, part of the U.S. Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences, reported that public school leaders nationwide estimated, on average, 32% of their students ended the school year a grade level behind in at least one academic subject — nearly equal to the 33% reported in 2021–22. Survey data were collected June 11-25 from 1,651 participating public K–12 schools (and school leaders) from every state and the District of Columbia. Data sets cover 2023–24 student attendance and learning recovery and strategies therein. For example, most survey respondents noted strategies their school used to support learning recovery for students included identifying individual student academic needs with diagnostic assessment data (88%), identifying individual student academic needs with formative assessment data (85%), or remedial instruction (82%). There was a 23-point swing, from 14% in 2021-22 to 37% in 2023-24, in school reporting having extended the school day, the school week, or the school year to accommodate learning recovery activities. “These new data are encouraging and give insight into strategies schools are using to promote recovery,” said Carr.",

Doorey, professeur de droit du travail et de l’emploi à l’Université York, dans un courriel.\n«Par conséquent, si le STTP conteste les mises à pied, Postes Canada aura besoin de preuves solides pour persuader la commission des relations de travail que les mises à pied ne sont absolument pas liées au fait que les travailleurs ont fait la grève. Il serait intéressant d’entendre cet argument», a-t-il déclaré.\nLa fin de la grève n’est pas en vue. Le ministre fédéral du Travail, Steven MacKinnon, a déclaré mercredi que le médiateur nommé par Ottawa n’aboutissait à rien, les parties étant trop éloignées sur des questions cruciales. Les pourparlers de médiation ont été temporairement suspendus et le gouvernement n’a pas l’intention d’intervenir.\nM. MacKinnon a indiqué qu’il avait convoqué les deux parties à son bureau à Ottawa. Il a toutefois affirmé qu’une directive pour un arbitrage exécutoire «n’était pas dans les plans».",

    "text": "Lok Sabha Elections 2024: As voting takes place for 12 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan on Friday (April 19) in the first phase of the polls, all eyes are focused on seats like Churu, Dausa, Alwar, Nagaur, Sikar and Bharatpur where the contest is expected to be tough with strong candidates from both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress in the fray. What makes the contests more interesting is the fact that prominent leaders from both sides including Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma contesting from his hometown Bharatpur, Union Ministers [Arjun Ram Meghwal](https://www.indiatvnews.com/topic/arjun-ram-meghwal) from Bikaner and Bhupender Yadav from Alwar, Pradesh Congress Committee chief Govind Singh Dotasra from his home constituency Sikar and Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) supremo Hanuman Beniwal from Nagaur are sweating it out to win these polls. Twelve of 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan will go to polls in the first phase of Lok Sabha elections on Friday. A Union minister is among the 114 candidates in the fray. Polling will be held in twelve out of 25 Lok Sabha seats from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. Voting in 12 out of 25 constituencies of Rajasthan will vote in the first phase today. - Churu - Nagaur - Ganganagar - Jhunjhunu - Bikaner - Sikar - Jaipur Rural - Jaipur - Alwar - Bharatpur - Karauli-Dholpur - Dausa Key constituencies include: - Bikaner- Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal (BJP) is in the fray against Madan Gopal Meghwal (Congress) - Churu- Paralympian Devendra Jhajharia (BJP) is contesting against Rahul Kaswan (Congress) - Nagaur- Jyoti Mirdha (BJP) against Hanuman Beniwal of Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) - Sikar- Swami Sumedhanand (BJP) against Amra Ram of CPI(M) - Jhunjhunu- Shubhkaran Choudhary (BJP) against Brijendra Singh Ola (Congress) How many voters will cast their vote in 1st phase?

He added that 7,98,520 (7.98 lakh) first-time voters aged 18-19 and 2,51,250 (2.51 lakh) disabled voters are also eligible to exercise their franchise in these 12 seats. Congress' election campaign in Rajasthan The grand old party Congress focused its election campaign on two issues- inflation and unemployment. Congress raised the issues of misuse of central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and CBI against opposition leaders and said the Constitution and democracy were under threat under the BJP rule. In its Nyay Patra, the party has promised to fill 30 lakh vacancies in government jobs, one-year apprenticeship programmes for young graduates, and legal guarantee on minimum support price for crops. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, leaders [Rahul Gandhi](https://www.indiatvnews.com/topic/rahul-gandhi), Priyanka Gandhi, former chief minister [Ashok Gehlot](https://www.indiatvnews.com/topic/ashok-gehlot) and others conducted a series of campaign meetings for the party's candidates across the state. BJP's election campaign in Rajasthan The BJP, on the other hand, attacked the Congress on appeasement politics, corruption and paper leak cases during its tenure in the state government. The saffron party also promoted its Sankalp Patra and highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"guarantees\". The party's campaign was led by Modi, who held multiple rallies in the state, including a roadshow in Dausa. Union Minister Amit Shah held a roadshow in Jaipur. BJP chief JP Nadda, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister [Yogi Adityanath](https://www.indiatvnews.com/topic/yogi-adityanath) and his Madhya Pradesh counterpart Mohan Yadav, and Defence Minister [Rajnath Singh](https://www.indiatvnews.com/topic/rajnath-singh) also addressed public rallies. During the election campaign, the ruling BJP mainly focused on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the work done by it in various sectors including infrastructure and schemes like Ujjawala. The saffron party, which came to power in the state in December last year, also targeted Congress over issues such as corruption, paper leaks, and crime against women during the rule of Ashok Gehlot-led former Congress government in the state. 2014 & 2019 poll results in Rajasthan The Bharatiya Janata Party won all 25 seats in Rajasthan on its own in 2014, and in 2019, NDA won 25 seats, the saffron party won 24 seats and the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party won one seat. Key contests in Rajasthan's 1st phase voting One of the key constituencies Nagaur is set to witness a keen contest between the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) candidate and former MP Hanuman Beniwal in alliance with Congress against BJP candidate and former Congress MP Jyoti Mirdha. Beniwal with the BJP’s support in the 2019 elections defeated Mirdha, who was then a Congress candidate. However, Beniwal separated from the NDA in 2020 over the farmer's agitation issue. In the Churu Lok Sabha constituency, former BJP MP Rahul Kaswan is contesting as Congress candidate against BJP candidate and paralympic Devendra Jhajharia. Dalit leader and Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, who has been representing Bikaner Lok Sabha seat since 2009, is contesting the Lok Sabha elections for 4th time.He is contesting against Congress candidate and former state minister Govind Ram Meghwal. In Sikar, the Congress' Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc partner, the CPI(M) has fielded former MLA Amra Ram against the BJP's incumbent MP Sumedanand Saraswati. Amra Ram had been an MLA from the Danta Ramgarh and the Dhod seats. Sikar is the hometown of the Congress' Rajasthan unit chief Govind Singh Dotasra. Of the eight assembly segments in Sikar, five are with the Congress. 2nd phase voting in Rajasthan The second phase of the elections in Rajasthan will be held on April 26. Polls will held in 13 Lok Sabha constituencies- Tonk, Ajmer, Pali, Jodhpur, Barmer, Jalore, Udaipur, Banswara, Chittorgarh, Rajsamand, Bhilwara, Kota and Jhalawar- in the second phase.

The dispute could force Olympics officials to cancel U.S. Olympic games, including the 2028 games in Los Angeles and the 2034 games just awarded to Salt Lake City.\nSuch a move would have a wide-ranging impact across Southern California, where communities including Los Angeles, Long Beach, Temecula, Carson, and Inglewood are already steeped in plans to host Olympic events in 2028.\nFind out what's happening in Los Angeleswith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nEarlier this year, news broke that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned medication at a training camp but still competed in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. The World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed the positive tests, but said it accepted the findings of a Chinese investigation that blamed a contaminated hotel kitchen for the positive tests,\nReuters reported.\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency accused the World Anti-Doping Agency of a cover-up and the federal government has launched an investigation into the case.\nFind out what's happening in Los Angeleswith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nThe global agency has launched a compliance review case against the U.S. anti-doping body. At the heart of the dispute is that country-level anti-doping authorities cannot undermine the authority of the world body — if next month's proceedings go against the U.S., the country would have to forfeit the right to participate or host the Olympics,\nhttps://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/us-olympic-officials-call-truce-doping-feud-2024-07-25/\nThe International Olympic Committee awarded Salt Lake City the 2034 Winter Games on Wednesday, which came with a warning that U.S. sports officials must support the World Anti-Doping Agency's authority.\nOlympics officials wrote that they could terminate Salt Lake City's host contract \"in cases where the supreme authority of WADA in the fight against doping is not fully respected or if the application of the anti-doping code is hindered or undermined.\"\nIf the anti-doping compliance review rules against the U.S., Los Angeles' contract could also be terminated, Reuters reported.\nThe rising tensions prompted the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee chief on Thursday to urge the domestic and world anti-doping agencies to work together to resolve the dispute. He also publicly pledged his committee's allegiance to the World Anti-Doping Agency's supreme authority.\nHigh-profile Olympians such as American swimmer Caeleb Dressel have been highly critical of the World Anti-Doping Agency since news of the Tokyo tests recently broke.\n“No. I don’t [think there will be a level playing field]. No. Not really,”\nDressel said. “I don’t really think they’ve given us enough evidence to support them with how this case was handled.”\nRead more:\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.\n[Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.](/california/los-angeles/subscribe)",

Otros estudiantes se burlaban de él por el estado de su ropa.\nLas probabilidades no estaban a su favor, pero encontró un sistema de apoyo. Se unió al equipo de fútbol de su escuela en séptimo grado y jugó en el equipo varsity en la preparatoria. Un pastor de jóvenes de una iglesia lo ayudó proporcionándole refugio.\nWashington se graduó recientemente de Nimitz High School en Irving, Texas, con una beca completa académica y deportiva para Feather River College en Quincy, California. Quiere especializarse en kinesiología.\nEl sueño de Washington es convertirse en un experto en los principios fisiológicos, anatómicos, biomecánicos, patológicos y neuropsicológicos de los movimientos del cuerpo humano para ayudar a atletas de todas las edades, y tal vez incluso abrir su propio centro deportivo.\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Ciarán Brennan: Government is letting bills mount up rather than deal with climate change\nA stitch in time saves nine is not just some trite phrase trotted out by grandparents or told to students in a home economics class.\nIt is sage advice to fix a problem when it is small, rather than to wait and let it become a bigger and more costly issue.\nUnfortunately, the advice seems to have been lost on the current Government — which seems content to let the fabric of our climate obligations tear wide open, even if it means costly repair bills.\nIreland faces a bill as high as €26bn for missing its EU climate targets, standing out as the worst in Europe per capita on its pledge to reduce emissions by 2030.\nA major report from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) and the Climate Change Advisory Council says Ireland risks paying “colossal” costs in the years ahead, but added that it isn’t too late to act now to limit the damage with significant investment in the likes of the energy grid and electric vehicles.\nYet, even as this news was being reported, we also heard that the minister for transport, environment, climate, and energy, Darragh O’Brien, was seeking Government approval to develop a State-led liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal.\nWhile this will be dressed up as a strategic reserve and vital for energy security as the State continues to transition to clean renewable energy, essentially it is spending a lot of public money on locking us into fossil fuel infrastructure.\nIn economics, it is an opportunity cost — the loss of other alternatives when one choice is made. It is also ironic, given the report’s advice to invest in other areas such as building the resilience of the national grid.\nThe draft programme for government showed a worrying shift away from the necessary momentum and action to address our climate and biodiversity crises and provide for a sustainable society, not to mention the huge costs coming down the road if we don’t act now.\nThe liquefied natural gas decision indicates that the worrying shift is crystallising into concrete action.\nAs part of the move to clean, renewable, and fossil-free energy, the Government should keep Ireland free of fracked gas and liquefied natural gas imports by introducing a permanent ban in legislation and not permitting new infrastructure that prolongs our dependence on fossil fuels.\nStorm Éowyn showed how vulnerable our electricity infrastructure was to storms and extreme weather.\nThe Government would be better served investing more in our electricity infrastructure to make it more resilient and to prepare the grid to carry more renewable energy.\nDeveloping an updated national strategy for renewable energy rollout would be a better approach. This could include:\n- Greater microgeneration supports;\n- Solar panels on the roof of every school and 1m homes by 2030;\n- Increased funding for community solar projects that allow low-income households to benefit from solar energy without needing to install individual systems;\n- Supporting community energy groups with access to grid connection so that communities can lead the renewable nature positive energy transition.\nThere are concrete steps that the next government can take which would have a real impact on emissions, build energy resilience, and would make meaningful improvements to our quality of life, ensuring that no person — regardless of their economic circumstance — is left behind.\nAs well as rejecting liquefied natural gas, removing fossil fuel subsidies in our taxation system, providing free school bus places, and retrofitting all social housing and the homes of those at-risk of energy poverty by 2030 are examples of the many ways we can reduce emissions and make Ireland a better place to live.\nUnfortunately, there are other signs that the Government is not serious about meeting our climate commitments.\nThe failure to maintain the modest 2:1 spending ratio in favour of new public transport versus new roads is a mistake and will lead to increased emissions.\nWe are already seeing this in action — funding for the construction of cycle lanes and other “active travel” infrastructure across Dublin has been slashed by almost €16m for this year.\nElsewhere in travel, the programme for government also included a clause that it would work with stakeholders to achieve the objective of lifting the passenger cap at Dublin Airport as soon as possible.\nSuch a commitment shows little regard for dealing with emissions from the aviation sector.\nOverall, Ireland seems to be stuck in a business as usual mode across every sector.\nThe programme of government’s commitment to allowing an increase in the number of data centres, without an independent national review of current and projected data centre energy demand, is also disappointing.\nAgriculture remains the State’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The report from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) and the Climate Change Advisory Council recommends that the Government could look at changing incentives in the agriculture sector.\nHowever, in contrast to very clear commitments for more public money for various farm activities, the programme for government is vague in committing funding to farmers for nature restoration.\nWithout new and additional funding, farmers won’t have the support they need to restore nature.\nIn addition, the Government appears to be doing the very minimum required in terms of promoting a circular economy and does not show any great ambition towards increasing circularity in Ireland.\nWe need a greater focus on a model of production and consumption that involves repairing, recycling, and reusing existing materials for as long as possible.\nIt is clear that our Government is prioritising economic growth over environmental protections.\nHowever, this is short-term thinking on their part.\nThe actions the Government takes in the next five years will be pivotal in determining whether we will meet our climate responsibilities or reverse biodiversity loss and avoid a hefty bill from the EU.\nIf it fails, as a nation, we may be down to our last threads, just at the same time as we will be forced to adapt to a changing climate that we failed to mitigate.\nWe can’t say we haven’t been warned.\n- Ciarán Brennan is communications officer with the Irish Environmental Network, an umbrella network of environmental NGOs\nCLIMATE & SUSTAINABILITY HUB",
