    "text": "USSF-52 successfully launches from the Eastern Range Published Dec. 29, 2023 By Taylor Nave Space Launch Delta 45 PATRICK SPACE FORCE BASE, Fla. -- In a monumental moment that underscores the nation's commitment to maintaining dominance in the space domain, the National Security Space Launch program successfully launched the Falcon Heavy USSF-52 mission on December 28, 2023, from the Eastern Range. This achievement not only highlights the program's two-decade-long legacy, but also signifies continued progress in reliable and resilient launch capability. The NSSL program, a critical component of the Department of Defense's efforts to ensure national security in space, is at the forefront of providing essential space support for the warfighter, national security, and various government spacelift missions. The success of the USSF-52 launch further solidifies the NSSL's role in fostering cooperation across the government and industry, a key aspect in outpacing near-peer competitors in the space domain. U.S. Space Force Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, Space Launch Delta 45 commander and Assured Access to Space program executive officer, emphasized the significance of this achievement, stating, \"The USSF-52 launch exemplifies our commitment to ensuring the national security and technological superiority of the United States.\" One of the standout features of the USSF-52 mission is its ability to expand the flight envelope of the X-37B, a cutting-edge reusable spacecraft operated by the United States Space Force. The launch into a new orbital regime opens up unprecedented experimentation opportunities, allowing the United States to stay ahead in space capabilities. This launch comes at a crucial time, as nations around the world intensify their efforts to establish dominance in space. The NSSL program's commitment to innovation and adaptability positions the United States as a leader in the evolving space landscape. \"The success of the USSF-52 launch is a testament to the dedication and expertise of the National Security Space Launch team,\" said Panzenhagen. \"This groundbreaking mission underscores the evolution of our space capabilities.\" As the USSF-52 mission enters its operational phase, the data and insights gathered will contribute to advancing the nation's understanding of space, further enhancing its strategic advantage. This launch augments the volume of the NSSL program’s portfolio, and the vital missions sets that ensure we can deliver those capabilities. In the years to come, the National Security Space Launch program will continue to play a vital role in shaping the nation's space strategy, ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of technological advancement and security in the space domain.",

    "text": "The Tournament of Roses Parade is a time-honored tradition that rings in the new year with meticulously decorated floats, marching bands and equestrian units.\nThe annual floral spectacle will take shape on New Year’s Day with three groups from San Diego County marching down the streets of Pasadena in front of thousands of fans in person with millions more watching on television.\nREAD MORE: Rose Parade 2025 lineup: Your guide to every float, band and equestrian unit, in order\nHere is your guide to each float, band and equestrian unit with ties to San Diego.\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance The arrival of two giant pandas in 2025 marked a new chapter for the San Diego Zoo. Xin Bao and Yun Chuan, the first giant pandas to enter the United States in 21 years, will be honored with a float called “Friendship Across the Earth.”\nFrom delicate cherry blossoms to specially transported golden and black bamboo, the 55-foot float boasts more than 700,000 individual plants curated by San Diego Zoo horticulturists.\nA 25-foot ridgeline combines thousands of plants and flowers to create lush landscapes where the pair of floral pandas will sit and greet parade fans. The giant pandas won’t be the only beloved animals on display. Red pandas Lucas and Adira and Malayan tiger Connor will be replicated using thousands of flowers.\nThe San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance says more than 3,100 diverse plant species were used to create the float.\nU.S. Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band United States Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band (Courtesy Tournament of Roses) One of the many talented marching bands set to perform in the parade is the United States Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band. The military band, led by drum major Gunnery Sergeant Geoffrey A. Parks, includes U.S. Marines from the 1st Marine Division Band, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing Band and Marine Band San Diego.\nMembers of the band are professional musicians and fully combat trained with years of military experience.\nThe annual Rose Parade is the only event that brings the group of world-class musicians and service members together to perform at the same time.\n Scripps Miramar Ranch Members of the Scripps Miramar Ranch walk down Colorado Boulevard during the 135th Rose Parade in Pasadena on Monday, Jan. 1, 2024.

    "text": "A talk between the striking employees of Samsung India and the company on Friday evening was inconclusive as over 500 workers stayed away from work for the fifth day in a row. The deadlock continues between the striking employees and the company’s management over the right to form union and wage revision.\nUnder the banner Samsung India Workers Union and backed by labour union CITU, the workers sat under a temporary shed about a km from the plant at Sunguvarchatram, near Chennai, demanding wage revision and the right to form a union.\nE Muthu Kumar, President, Samsung India Workers Union - CITU, told businessline that during the talks, the company officials wanted to leave aside the issue of union formation. However, this was unacceptable as it was the main issue and cannot be compromised, he said.\nFirst in history Production has been significantly affected, claimed the striking workers. This is the first strike in the history of the 16-year-old plant that manufactures various consumer durables, including ACs, refrigerators and washing machines.\nA representative of the strike workers said during the meeting on Friday, company officials told them that they would take up the issues with the management. “We will continue the strike and go to the State government with our demands on Monday,” he added.\nThe plant employs around 1,700 workers and the wages of these workers are less than the wages of some industrial workers. “For 16 years, these workers have been without a registered union, but the management’s attitude, prudishness, abusive practices and workload have prompted the workers to form a union,” a strike notice said.\nWorkers claimed that the company has deployed hundreds of casual labourers and apprenticeships to keep the factory running. The production is just around 25 per cent, they claimed.",

    "text": "English Swedish Published: 2024-07-05 10:10:00 CEST Ratos AB\nInvestor News Ratos Company Semcon's climate target approved by the Science Based Target initiative Semcon's climate target has now been validated and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\"We are proud that Semcon has now had its climate goal approved by SBTi. It shows that Semcon's own climate work is scientifically based, and it is another important piece of the puzzle in Ratos's group-wide sustainability work. It is a result of purposeful work at Semcon and a conviction that everyone needs to contribute to the journey towards net-zero\" says Josefine Uppling, Vice President Communication & Sustainability, Ratos.\nSemcon's near-term science-based target, which has now been approved by the SBTi, is the following:\nSemcon commits to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. (The target boundary includes biogenic land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.)\n\"Semcon has a strong combination of engineering, digital and sustainability expertise, and we support our customers in the development of green technologies, the transition to net-zero and circular value chains, and much more. While our largest possibility to contribute to the shift to a net-zero society is through our customer projects, we ourselves must do what is required of all companies and organisations right now. The approval of our climate target by the SBTi validates that our commitment is in line with the 1.5°C ambition,\" says Markus Granlund, CEO of Semcon.\nIn June 2021, Semcon committed to setting climate targets in line with the 1.5 °C ambition with the SBTi. Due to Ratos's acquisition of Semcon in 2022, Semcon's proposal for near-term target was then submitted in December 2022. The target was resubmitted in November 2023 as the Group structure changed following the divestment of Semcon's Product Information business area (today independent company Aleido).\nSince 2021, Semcon's overall commitment is to halve emissions by 2030 and be net-zero by 2040, with 2019 as the base year. It's largest sources of emissions are linked to employee commuting, business travel and purchased goods and services.\nAbout Semcon\nSemcon is an international technology partner for companies and organisations in transformation. The company combines engineering expertise, digital services and sustainability know-how in a unique offering for product, production and service development.

Fallen trees and mudslides had made the route difficult for bikers and horses to pass. (Courtesy of San Juan National Forest) The San Juan National Forest announced Wednesday that the Hermosa Creek Trail, which runs from the Lower Hermosa Trailhead northwest wrapping up behind Purgatory Resort, has been rerouted, rehabilitated and reestablished.\nForest managers never actually closed the trail, SJNF spokeswoman Lorena Williams said in an email to The Durango Herald. But severe damage from the 416 Fire in 2018 left downed trees across many parts of the trail, and 2022 landslides left a 30-foot deep hole in a section of the trail.\n“It was just very difficult or impossible to pass for horses, motorcycles, and cyclists,” Williams said.\nThe trail, which connects upper and lower Hermosa, is a single-track pathway open to hikers, horse riders, mountain bikers and motorcyclists.\nOver two months this summer, about 25 people put in a total 2,700 hours of work to reroute a quarter-mile section of the trail around the blowout and removed over 200 downed trees, according to an SJNF news release. Trail crews had to use livestock to transport materials, gear, food and fuel 10 miles to the site of the blowout.\nThe San Juan National Forest announced the reestablishment of the Hermosa Creek Trail, which runs from the Lower Hermosa Trailhead toward Purgatory. Landslides in 2022 left a 30-foot hole in a section of the trail, which had to be rerouted.

(Courtesy of San Juan National Forest) The lower trailhead sits northwest of Hermosa off County Road 201 and Forest Service Road 576 in the Hermosa Creek Special Management Area created by Congress and President Barack Obama in 2014. Much of the area was damaged by the high-intensity 416 Fire, which incinerated 54,000 acres of forest.\n“Dead snags will continue to fall across the trail, and San Juan NF employees and volunteer groups are working out plans to revisit the trail system on a regular basis,” the release says. “Recreationists should be cautious when traveling through a burned area, especially in high winds or during heavy rain, and should be prepared for additional trees across the trail.”\nrschafir@durangoherald.com",
