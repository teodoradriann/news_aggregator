    "text": "В мире ВОЗ призвала повысить цены на табак и алкоголь минимум на 50% First News Media 09:00 - Сегодня Всемирная организация здравоохранения (ВОЗ) призвала страны мира увеличить стоимость табачной и алкогольной продукции, а также сахаросодержащих напитков минимум на 50%.\nВ заявлении, опубликованном на сайте организации, говорится, что такая мера необходима для предотвращения хронических заболеваний.\nКроме того, в ВОЗ отметили, что повышение цен на \"вредные\" товары за счет акцизов и других налоговых сборов позволит привлечь в бюджеты стран дополнительные средства. Повысить стоимость такой продукции организация предлагает к 2035 г.\nИз документа следует, что потребление табака, алкоголя и сладких напитков способствует расширению эпидемии неинфекционных заболеваний, например, болезней сердца, рака и диабета. 75% всех смертей во всем мире происходят по причине этих заболеваний.\n\"Недавний отчет показал, что единовременное повышение цен на эти продукты на 50% может предотвратить 50 млн преждевременных смертей в течение следующих 50 лет\", - подчеркнуто в публикации.\nПо данным Всемирной организации здравоохранения (ВОЗ) на 2024 г., в мире каждый восьмой человек страдает ожирением, с 1990 г. их количество выросло почти вдвое.",

    "text": "The New Zealand operation of global IT infrastructure services provider Kyndryl returned to profit in the year ending 31 March, 2024, according to accounts posted with the Companies Office this month.\nWhile total sales declined from $78.2 million to $75 million, profit rallied from a $7.1 million loss in 2023 into the black by $7.8 million.\nThat turnaround was delivered courtesy of significantly lower cost of sales, down from $84.1 million to $62.2 million.\nThe accounts also reveal the price T4 Group paid for Kyndryl’s East Tamaki data centre last year: $5.7 million.\nKyndryl NZ could not comment specifically on the results, but did provide a general business update.\nAfter joining the business last April, country leader Jo Healey had been working with local customers to plan the next phase of their technology transformation journeys, drawing on use-cases from Kyndryl’s global expertise in banking and insurance, retail and education.\nIn November 2024, the company also appointed Kimberley Marlay as head of alliances and strategic partnerships for A/NZ.\n“As cloud continues to be a strong area of growth for Kyndryl locally and there is an increasing shift towards a hybrid cloud model, Kimberley is focused on deepening our joint value propositions with the hyperscalers,” Healey said.\nOrganisations were still investing in their mission-critical IT infrastructure, she said.\n“Our business is not discretionary, as evidenced in our last earnings call with reports of 20 per cent growth in five of our six practice areas globally.\n“We’re seeing this in New Zealand through the conversations we’re having with customers and the demand for Kyndryl to continue providing technology services.”\n“There was an appetite to invest in secure and resilient systems particularly in industries such as financial services where Kyndryl had a “strong footprint”, Healey said.\nThe rise of hybrid cloud also allowed businesses to share data between their on-premises infrastructure and the cloud, hosted in new hyperscaler facilities that were significantly more energy efficient and cost effective than their older, subscale counterparts.\n“This evolution presents an opportunity for companies like Kyndryl to embrace a more flexible and reliable way of managing data center operations — and ultimately position us to better meet our customers’ growing business needs for decades to come,” Healey said.",

    "text": "Davos a fait très fort, jeudi dans le Eisstadion. Le club suisse, qui avait débuté sa Coupe Spengler sur une belle victoire contre Frölunda , a créé la surprise en renversant Team Canada dans un dernier tiers fou. Vainqueurs 3-4, les Grisons ont brillé face au favori de la compétition. C’était pourtant très mal parti pour Davos. Abandonné par la défense dans une position favorable pour tirer, Jooris ouvrait le score dès l’entame du match pour la formation canadienne (5e). Pas encore rassasiés, les Canadiens continuaient à pousser, apportant un danger presque permanent autour de la cage suisse.\nHaapala buteur Et pourtant, ce sont les Grisons qui ont inscrit le second but du match, sur une réalisation du Lausannois Haapala (31e). Un espoir de courte durée, puisqu’une sublime touche de Joly, déviant un tir de Leslie, remettait les Nord-Américains sur les rails (38e). Deux minutes plus tard, Quenneville faisait le break (40e).\nLe HCD parvenait à surprendre une seconde fois son adversaire dès le début du troisième tiers, avec un joli but signé Fora (42e). Boostés par cette réussite, les hommes de Josh Holden provoquaient la folie des supporters en arrachant l’égalisation, par l’éternel capitaine Ambühl (51e). Et c’est au terme d’un magnifique effort collectif, parfaitement négocié, que Andersson offrait la victoire aux siens (57e).\nDirectement qualifié Grâce à ce succès, Davos se positionne à la première place du groupe et se qualifie directement pour les demi-finales. Une sacrée performance pour les Grisons, qui espèrent retrouver le titre après onze ans de disette.\nFigurant à la 2e place, Team Canada jouera vendredi soir contre les Finlandais de KalPa Kuopio, vaincu par Ambri et Pardubice.\nTeam Canada - HC Davos 3-4 (1-0, 2-1, 0-3)\nEisstadion, 6267 spectateurs.\nArbitres: MM.

Finally, there are glimmers of new light in dark places……accompanied by a literal breath of fresh air.\nJust look at this week’s stunning line up of Uranus conjunct Sedna/ Jupiter/ Mercury/ New Moon/ Venus in Air sign Gemini – it has personal choice and freedom written all over it.\nCircle June 3 2024 when Jupiter at 1° 53’ Gemini exactly trines Pluto at 1° 53’ Aquarius.\nGemini and Aquarius are both air signs and associated with people and ideas in free circulation.

This becomes your psychic clothing, your armour, your protection\nfocus on feeding friendships and not defeating foes . No matter how difficult it might be, we have to build alliances, create community. Create safe places and gather your tribe to have radical conversations about uncertain futures. When we come together, we learn how to heal.\nconsistently update your technology and expand your communication platforms\nChandra Symbol New Moon Gemini 16: a single sunflower wilting and dropping its seeds\n“The sun shines so bright that it compels all of us to empty ourselves out and bake in the light and the warmth of spirit. We are transfixed by solar power and impelled to unite with our destiny, no matter how extravagant or unlikely that destiny proves to be. A momentum is pulsating, with edges to track.\nIn order to do so you have to breathe into it and let go a whole lot, and then there you are, calling onward. You can hear it. Everybody else can too.

    "text": "原标题：《自然》称年轻世代或将面临更多极端气候\n根据发表在最新一期《自然》杂志上的一篇论文，气候危机的负担将主要由年轻世代而非年长世代承担。分析显示，在1.5℃升温情景下，2020年出生的人群中约52%将面临前所未有的热浪风险，而1960年出生的人群中这一比例仅为16%。研究结果强调了减少温室气体排放以减轻气候变化对年轻世代的紧迫性。\n随着气候持续变暖，人类面临的极端气候事件（包括热浪、作物减产和干旱）将日益加剧，年轻世代将比年长世代更频繁地遭遇此类极端事件。然而，在不同气候变暖路径下，不同年份出生且具有不同社会经济脆弱性的人群面临此类极端气候事件暴露风险的具体规模仍不明确。\n比利时布鲁塞尔自由大学团队在全球范围内，对不同气候变暖路径下，不同人群一生中遭遇前所未有极端事件的暴露情况进行了预测。“前所未有”的暴露，被定义为在没有人为导致气候变化的世界中，遭遇相同极端事件的概率小于万分之一。\n团队发现，与1960年出生的人相比，2020年出生的人在当前减缓政策下（目标为到2100年全球气温较工业革命前升高2.7℃）的暴露风险将翻倍。他们指出，全球1960年出生的人群中，约16%（1300万人）将面临前所未有的终生热浪暴露风险。与此同时，如果全球变暖到2100年比工业革命前水平升高1.5℃，2020年出生的人群中约52%（6200万人）将经历前所未有的热浪暴露风险，如果升温达到3.5℃，这一比例将升至92%。在将分析范围扩展至5个额外气候极端事件（作物减产、野火、干旱、河流洪水和热带气旋）以及热浪后，研究团队发现，在所有极端事件中，暴露程度都会随出生年份推移而明显升高。\n团队指出，该研究存在一些局限性。例如，分析未考虑人口在国家边界内的流动以及生育率和死亡率的趋势。然而，该结果强调了制定有效策略以减少未来温室气体排放、保护未来世代的必要性。（张梦然）\n原标题：《自然》称年轻世代或将面临更多极端气候 来源：科技日报\nVIP课程推荐\nAPP专享直播\n热门推荐\n收起24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance）",

    "text": "La DANA mantiene este viernes festivo en aviso amarillo a casi toda la provincia de Badajoz por lluvias intensas, que podrían alcanzar los 15 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, según las previsiones de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet). La alerta por lluvia se ha activado esta medianoche en el sur de Badajoz y a las 5:00 horas en la Vegas del Guadiana y Barros y Serena. El aviso permanecerá en vigor hasta las 15:00 horas en las Vegas del Guadiana y Barros y Serena y se extenderá hasta las 18:00 horas en el sur de Badajoz, donde además se podrían dar fuertes tormentas. El Centro de Atención de Urgencias y Emergencias 112 recomienda en estos casos que se revisen bajadas de agua de los tejados acumulación de escombros, objetos, hojas y tierras que puedan obstaculizar el paso del agua por cauces, cunetas, acequias o alcantarillado de las localidades. También hay que prestar especial atención a los sumideros y socavones y muros en mal estado. Respecto a la circulación por las carreteras se recomienda a la ciudadanía que lo haga con la máxima precaución posible. Así, hay que estar atento a posibles desprendimientos de tierra, no atravesar carreteras inundadas, no estacionar en cauces secos, ni en las orillas de los ríos. A su vez, se recomienda también llevar consigo siempre un teléfono cargado para contactar, en caso de necesidad, con el 112.",
