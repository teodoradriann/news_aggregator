    "text": "Parts of England could see a 10C bump in temperatures as a short period of fine weather is predicted for midweek. The Met Office is forecasting that the chilly temperatures of this weekend will give way to much milder conditions during the week, with East Anglia and the Home Counties seeing up to 22C on Wednesday. But meteorologist Tom Morgan said the country would not be seeing an Indian summer this week as the better weather will be replaced by wet and windy conditions by next weekend. He said: “Temperatures are going to rise gradually, peaking probably on Wednesday in eastern areas, and we might well see in some spots 20C, and 22C is not out of question, probably in eastern England – so East Anglia down towards the South East. “But it will be much milder compared to now for everyone. “It’s possible we could exceed 20C in London but the peak temperatures might well be up towards the Home Counties and up to Cambridgeshire. “There’s going to be a stark contrast in temperatures between today and Wednesday. “Some places will be 10C warmer because today is a very chilly day for early October, so the main theme for this week that it’s turning much milder for all.” He added: “It’s not going to be an Indian summer – an Indian summer is a period of fine, settled weather with widely high temperatures after a period of frosts. “We have had some frost but it’s only going to be a day or two that we see these high temperatures.” Mr Morgan added that the west and Wales could be “quite wet” midweek with the rest of the country expected to see strong winds and band of heavy rain pushing eastwards on Friday. He said next weekend is “looking pretty unsettled”, with the North West including Scotland and Northern Ireland being wet and windy but possibly less so in the South East. He added: “So it will be pretty autumnal with temperatures that might be much higher than this weekend, so into mid-teen temperatures.” Subscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie Buy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.

    "title": "Rain will be widespread in Florida Friday and Saturday; local flooding and severe storm cells are possible - WMNF 88.5 FM",
    "text": "Florida Public Radio Emergency Network (FPREN) Storm Center | By Megan Borowski\nSeveral rounds of heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected to impact Florida on Friday and Saturday. Isolated severe thunderstorm cells, and localized flash flooding will be possible, especially across parts of South Florida, where storm total rainfall amounts are forecasted to range between three and six inches.\nOn Thursday morning, a trough of low pressure was positioned over the western Gulf Coast, near Corpus Christie. Scattered shower and thunderstorm activity was already developing in the vicinity of this feature, from San Antonio eastward to Houston and western Louisiana. Throughout the remainder of the day Thursday, this low is forecasted to strengthen as it tracks east-northeastward, paralleling the western and central Gulf Coast.\nA warm front should develop southeast of the center of low pressure, and this boundary will likely stretch through the Gulf and approach the state of Florida from the west late Thursday evening into early Friday morning. Along and ahead of the front, a complex of heavy rain and thunderstorms is forecasted to develop, and these storms will likely produce periods of heavy rain, gusty winds, and a few strong thunderstorms over the southern two thirds of the peninsula on Friday morning.\nModerate to heavy rain rates are expected to continue through the day Friday and potentially into early Saturday morning across South Florida. Rainfall totals could reach three to six inches across Monroe, Collier, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties. Interests in locations like Naples, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Key West should prepare for localized flash flooding. In addition, the atmosphere will be supportive of severe thunderstorm development, especially over South Florida and along the immediate Gulf Coast of the peninsula. Interests in Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fort Myers, Naples , West Palm Beach, Miami, and the Keys should remain alert as storms could quickly produce brief waterspouts/tornadoes or damaging straight-line winds.\nWhile the warm front aids in shower and thunderstorm development over the peninsula, the core of low pressure should track northeastward from the Central Gulf Coast region inland through Alabama and Georgia. The low will drag a cold front through Florida’s Panhandle during the afternoon and evening hours on Friday, and along this boundary we expect a broken line of thunderstorms to develop. As with the storms over the peninsula, the cells along the cold front could produce periods of heavy rain rates, gusty winds, and tornadoes. While rain is expected for most of the day Friday over the southern half of the peninsula, storms likely won’t become widespread over the Panhandle until the afternoon and evening Friday, lasting through early Saturday morning.\n1 of 2\n2 of 2\nIn anticipation of Friday’s system, forecasters at the Weather Prediction Center have outlined most of the Panhandle and South Florida under a level one out of four (or “marginal”) risk for flash flooding. The Miami metro area is under a level two out of four risk for flooding (or “slight”). In addition, meteorologists at the Storm Prediction Center have included most of Florida’s Gulf Coast and South Florida under a level one out of five (or “marginal”) risk for severe thunderstorms on Friday.\nThe cold front from this system should track from the Panhandle through the peninsula during the day Saturday, and another round of strong storms is possible from the I-4 corridor southward. Any additional rainfall could overwhelm the already saturated environment, and localized flooding could become more widespread.\nConditions across the Sunshine State should improve by the latter half of the weekend. By Sunday, skies should be mostly sunny from the Panhandle to the Keys and highs should range from the upper 60s in the north, to the upper 70s in the south.\nTags flooding , FPREN , weather Share Related Articles News and Public Affairs Friday, March 22nd 2024 Rain will be widespread in Florida Friday and Saturday; local flooding and severe storm cells are possible\nBlog Friday, March 22nd 2024 “BEING PRESENT & GRATEFUL” ON MORNING ENERGY\nNews and Public Affairs Friday, March 22nd 2024 DeSantis signs major health care package\nNews and Public Affairs Thursday, March 21st 2024 The Florida Legislature sends its bills to relax child labor laws and to keep kids off social media to the governor\nEducation Thursday, March 21st 2024 Hillsborough students served first ever fully Florida-sourced lunch\nJoin the WMNF Circle of Friends!\nWays to support WMNF volunteers have fun providing a variety of needed services to keep your community radio.

    "title": "Identity theft victims are waiting almost 2 years for help from the IRS - Nextgov/FCW",
    "text": "Identity theft victims are waiting almost 2 years for help from the IRS The tax agency needs to do more to bring down that wait time, the National Taxpayer Advocate says. Identity theft victims have to wait about 22 months on average to get resolution on their cases from the IRS, according to a recent [blog](https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/news/nta-blog/identity-theft-victims-are-waiting-nearly-two-years-to-receive-their-tax-refunds/2024/06/) from the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent organization within the IRS charged with advising the agency on taxpayer issues. “Hundreds of thousands of taxpayers each year discover they are victims of tax-related identity theft when they electronically submit their federal income tax return and the IRS rejects their return, informing them that someone else already filed a return,” the blog states. After affected individuals file a tax return on paper and fill out required paperwork for identity theft, they hit those year-plus wait times, which went up by 119 days between [ September](https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2024/01/irs-has-unconscionable-delays-helping-identity-theft-victims-taxpayer-advocate-says/393294/) 2023 and April 2024, according to the blog. “These processing times are far outside the processing norms and are completely unacceptable,” the blog post notes, urging the IRS to get the number down to the agency target of 120 days or less. “The situation demands a more robust response from the IRS to rapidly decrease processing times and give tax-related identity theft victims the assistance and payment of the refunds they are awaiting.” The problem stems from the IRS shuffling identity theft employees to answer the IRS’ general, toll-free phone lines in an effort to bring those wait times down, according to the Taxpayer Advocate. The IRS also had to temporarily shut down operations at the start of the pandemic. The tax agency says that it’s working on it. “The IRS is actively working to implement a range of improvements to provide faster service to victims of identity theft, including identifying, training and moving additional resources to work these important cases,” an IRS spokesperson told Nextgov/FCW via email, noting that “the backlog of identity theft cases remains one of the most significant ongoing service gaps.” The agency has already tripled the closure rate of identity theft cases since 2020, they said. The taxpayer advocate blog also notes that there “appears” to be an increased number of closed cases despite the extended timelines. IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel spoke about the problem during a public address in March, noting that putting more IRS-related tasks online — a current goal of the agency — can free up IRS employees for more difficult problems. “A fully digital IRS unlocks our potential to help victims speedily so that they’re not losing sleep anymore,” he said at the time. The IRS is also planning to review the process to identify ways to improve victims’ overall experience and to bolster its prevention efforts against evolving, tax-related identity theft threats, the spokesperson said. For now, “it takes way too long,” Werfel said. “We have to change that. We have to make it that if you are unfortunately a victim of identity theft, you can get fast resolution from the IRS.” One of the biggest impacts for those left waiting is the associated delay of their refunds, which don’t get delivered until after the IRS resolves any identity theft issues, the taxpayer advocate says. Nearly 70% of the taxpayers with identity theft cases had an adjusted gross income at or below 250% of the federal poverty line in fiscal 2023, the blog states, meaning the delay could cause economic harm for those who may need tax credits to pay living expenses.",

    "text": "Electricity giant SSE said it generated nearly two-thirds more renewable energy Electricity giant SSE has reported a surge in renewable energy generation, with figures soaring by nearly two-thirds in the early summer months compared to last year. The London-listed company revealed that its renewables division&#039;s output was up by 60% in the three months leading up to June 30, attributing the boost to favourable weather and increased capacity. SSE announced that green generation rocketed to 2,596 GWh, citing &quot;a return to more normalised weather conditions over the period, in addition to year-on-year capacity increases&quot;. Meanwhile, gas-fired generation dipped by 10% to 3,714 GWh, as noted in the company&#039;s trading statement before its annual general meeting on Thursday. SSE confirmed that its first quarter financials were on target, aligning with its £20.5billion investment plan set for the next five years, with renewables securing over a third of this investment. The firm is aiming for nine gigawatts of installed capacity by 2026/27, mainly through offshore wind farm ventures. Barry O&#039;Regan, SSE&#039;s chief financial officer, said: &quot;We have made a solid start to the financial year as we convert our premium project pipeline into high-quality sustainable earnings.&quot; &quot;We remain on track to meet our 2027 growth targets that are underpinned by world-class assets and balance sheet strength, with two-thirds of revenue either regulated or already backed by existing government policy.&quot; &quot;The outlook is supported by the enhanced clean power target of the new UK Government, which recognises the essential need for investment in renewables, flexible power and electricity networks areas where SSE has unrivalled capability and significant growth potential.&quot;",

    "text": "SEATTLE — A beloved waterfront café in Seattle is celebrating 25 years in business.\nAgua Verde Café at the University of Washington opened in 1998 with a handful of tables and a New Mexican menu.\nThese days, it can seat more than 100 guests and serves authentic Mexican cuisine.\nBut one thing has never changed: the view of Portage Bay.\n\"You see the houseboats right across, you see the University Bridge going up and down, you see crew boats going by, you see seaplanes flying down,” said owner Travis Rosenthal. “It's a really special spot.”\nLong before he owned the café, he was a customer and fan.\n“I lived across the water when I first moved to Seattle in the late '90's and used to kayak over here and loved Agua Verde for years, and then had the opportunity to purchase it in 2019,” Rosenthal said.\nHis first move as owner? Making sure the long-time staff remained. Some employees have worked at Agua since the beginning.\nSergio Gaytan Martinez started as a busser when he was 15 years old.\n\"I'm the general manager for the café,” Gaytan Martinez said. “I honestly never thought I'd be in these shoes and it's been an incredible journey… (The staff is) truly my family and I don't know what I would do without Agua.\"\nRosenthal did make some changes to the restaurant itself. He ripped out a wall and built a new bar with views of the water.\nSeating expanded to the lower level in an outdoor area with a food truck called the Marina Cantina.\nDuring the pandemic, they developed canned cocktails for to-go orders.\nThe menu was also revamped to feature more fresh and elevated options, including tortilla made from scratch.\nChef Rogelio Reynoso was passionate about making authentic tortillas using Mexican heirloom corn. The corn is flown in, ground down and formed into fresh tortillas every day.\n\"There really is a difference,” Rosenthal said.\nSummer is the café’s busiest time, but UW faculty and students are steady customers during the colder months. Gaytan Martinez said some regulars are generations of the same families.\n\"It's almost cliche, but it's home,” he said. \"That's the kind of experience that Agua provides, it's just that home base.\"\nAgua Verde Café is open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner (no reservations, walk-in only.) Marina Cantina is open Monday – Friday from 5 p.m. – closing, and Saturday – Sunday from noon – closing. Both are located at 1303 NE Boat Street. Street parking is nearby, and there are two boat slips for customers who come via Portage Bay.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest. Contact us:",
