    "title": "10 “Groundbreaking” Scientific Studies That Fooled the World",
    "text": "Scientific breakthroughs have the power to transform our understanding of the world, influence public policy, and even change the course of history. However, not every breakthrough stands up to scrutiny. While science is ideally a pursuit of truth, sometimes researchers falsify data, ignore contradictory evidence, or stretch the truth to achieve fame, funding, or validation of their theories. This has led to a number of high-profile studies that, once celebrated as major discoveries, were later exposed as fraudulent, deceptive, or deeply flawed.\nIn this list, we’ll look at ten scientific studies that were initially hailed as groundbreaking but ultimately discredited due to ethical breaches or deception.\nRelated: Top10 Absurd Scientific Experiments And Discoveries\n10 The MMR Vaccine and Autism Link THAT Vaccine Autism Study Explained\nWatch this video on YouTube\nOne of the most damaging studies in recent history is the 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield, which claimed to show a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine and autism. Published in The Lancet , the study sparked widespread fear about vaccines and fueled the anti-vaccine movement, with many parents opting out of vaccinating their children. However, Wakefield’s study was found to be deeply flawed and ethically compromised. Investigations revealed that he had altered data, chosen specific patients to support his claims, and failed to disclose financial conflicts of interest related to his work.\nIn 2010, The Lancet formally retracted the paper, and Wakefield lost his medical license. Multiple large-scale studies have since disproven any link between the MMR vaccine and autism, but the damage was done. Wakefield’s deceptive research created long-lasting public mistrust in vaccines, contributing to vaccine hesitancy that still impacts public health today. [1]\n9 The Fleischmann-Pons Cold Fusion Experiment\nThe Men Who Promised the Impossible: Unlimited Energy\nWatch this video on YouTube\nIn 1989, electrochemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons claimed to have achieved “cold fusion,” a form of nuclear fusion that occurs at room temperature, offering the promise of nearly limitless clean energy. Their announcement made headlines worldwide, and the possibility of cold fusion excited scientists and the public alike. However, when other researchers attempted to replicate the experiment, they failed to get the same results, raising doubts about Fleischmann’s and Pons’s claims.\nFurther scrutiny revealed that the two scientists had rushed their findings to the public without rigorous peer review, and some even accused them of selectively reporting data. Eventually, the scientific community dismissed their results as experimental error. Despite a brief burst of enthusiasm, the dream of cold fusion remained unfulfilled, and the incident became a reminder of the importance of reproducibility in scientific research. [2]\n8 Stapel’s Fabricated Social Psychology Experiments The scientist who faked over 50 studies\nWatch this video on YouTube\nDiederik Stapel, a prominent Dutch social psychologist, was known for his groundbreaking work on human behavior. His studies explored controversial topics, like how environmental cues can influence racial stereotypes and other forms of social bias. However, in 2011, an internal investigation revealed that Stapel had fabricated data for dozens of his studies. Rather than conducting actual experiments, he simply made up results that fit his hypotheses.\nAs his deception came to light, dozens of his published papers were retracted, and Stapel’s career in academia was destroyed. The scandal rocked the field of social psychology and highlighted weaknesses in peer review and oversight. Stapel’s case raised serious questions about how easily fraudulent data could be published and praised and led to greater scrutiny of similar studies in psychology. [3]\n7 The “Gay Gene” Study There's No Such Thing As A 'Gay Gene,' A New Study Argues | TIME\nWatch this video on YouTube\nIn 1993, geneticist Dean Hamer published a study suggesting that male homosexuality could be linked to a specific region on the X chromosome, dubbed the “gay gene.” This discovery was celebrated as a potential biological explanation for sexual orientation and generated significant public interest. However, subsequent attempts to replicate Hamer’s findings failed, and other scientists criticized his methodology, pointing out that the study’s sample size was too small to draw meaningful conclusions.\nOver time, Hamer’s study was largely discredited, and researchers now believe that sexual orientation is likely influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors rather than a single “gay gene.” While the study sparked an important conversation about genetics and sexual orientation, it ultimately proved to be an example of how scientific findings can be sensationalized before rigorous validation. [4]\n6 The “Power Pose” Study in Psychology\nAre Power Poses Super Life Hacks or Super Junk?\nWatch this video on YouTube\nAmy Cuddy’s 2010 study on “power poses”—suggesting that standing in certain postures could increase confidence and reduce stress—quickly gained traction, even sparking a popular TED Talk. The idea was simple: by striking powerful poses, people could positively influence their behavior and emotions. The study’s findings were widely publicized, leading many to adopt “power posing” as a tool for self-improvement in personal and professional settings.\nHowever, subsequent attempts to replicate Cuddy’s findings were unsuccessful, and many psychologists criticized the study for using small sample sizes and weak statistical methods. The backlash was significant, and “power posing” was later dismissed as pseudoscience. This incident highlighted the challenges of reproducibility in psychology and underscored the dangers of overstating preliminary findings. [5]\n5 The Human Memory “Repression” Theory\nAre Repressed Memories Real?\nWatch this video on YouTube\nThe theory of repressed memories, popularized by psychiatrist Elizabeth Loftus in the 1990s, suggested that people could “repress” traumatic memories and later recover them. This idea quickly gained traction, especially in cases of abuse, where patients recalled “forgotten” events during therapy. However, research later showed that memory is far more malleable than previously thought and that therapists could unintentionally implant false memories in their patients.\nStudies have since debunked repressed memory theory, with Loftus herself becoming an advocate for understanding memory’s fallibility. The controversy around repressed memories also led to numerous legal cases being overturned. This shift in understanding had a profound impact on psychology, law, and public perception of memory reliability. [6]\n4 The “Lying Is Stressful” Study The Truth About Lie Detectors\nWatch this video on YouTube\nIn the early 20th century, psychologist William Moulton Marston conducted studies that suggested physiological responses like increased heart rate and blood pressure could indicate when a person was lying. His research led to the development of the polygraph, or “lie detector,” based on the belief that lying creates a unique stress response that can be measured. Marston’s work claimed that people exhibit consistent physical reactions under stress when they’re deceptive, leading to a wave of interest in using polygraphs as a truth-telling tool in law enforcement and beyond.\nHowever, later studies cast significant doubt on Marston’s findings. Researchers found that stress responses measured by polygraphs could also be triggered by fear, anxiety, or other emotional reactions unrelated to lying, making them unreliable. Despite this, polygraph testing became widely adopted and remains in use in certain areas, though many courts and scientists now recognize the technology as flawed. Marston’s initial study, though groundbreaking at the time, illustrates how one flawed hypothesis can lead to decades of real-world applications and controversy in criminal justice and employment screening. [7]\n3 The “Elderly Priming” Study \"Classic\" Priming Studies (Learn Social Psychology Fundamentals)\nWatch this video on YouTube\nIn 1996, social psychologist John Bargh and his team conducted a study that seemed to demonstrate how subtle cues, or “primes,” could influence people’s behavior without their awareness. In this experiment, participants were given word puzzles containing terms associated with old age, such as “Florida” and “wrinkle.” After completing the puzzles, the researchers observed that participants who had been exposed to these “elderly” words walked more slowly when leaving the lab. The study suggested that simple word associations could unconsciously impact actions, fueling interest in the concept of priming and unconscious behavioral influence.\nHowever, in 2012, a team led by researcher Stéphane Doyen attempted to replicate the findings but found no significant effect on walking speed, challenging the original study’s validity. This failure to replicate was part of a broader “replication crisis” in psychology, where several high-profile studies, especially in social psychology, were found to lack reliability. The elderly priming study, once celebrated as a breakthrough, is now frequently cited as a cautionary example of the importance of replicability in psychological research and the risks of accepting eye-catching results without rigorous scrutiny. [8]\n2 Jan Hendrik Schön’s Physics Breakthroughs He almost faked his way to a Nobel-Prize\nWatch this video on YouTube\nIn the early 2000s, physicist Jan Hendrik Schön was heralded as a rising star for his work on organic semiconductors, claiming to have made breakthroughs in developing molecular transistors. Schön’s research suggested that organic materials could be used to create ultra-small, flexible electronics, opening new avenues for technological advancement. However, it was later discovered that Schön had falsified his data in multiple studies, essentially fabricating results to support his hypotheses.\nThe Schön scandal shocked the physics community, leading to the retraction of over a dozen papers and damaging the reputation of his collaborators and affiliated institutions. Schön’s fraudulent research emphasized the need for rigorous peer review and transparency, and the scandal resulted in tighter scrutiny in scientific publishing. Schön’s fall from grace remains a cautionary tale about the pressures faced by researchers to produce groundbreaking results. [9]\n1 The CRISPR Baby Experiment\nDesigner Babies – The Problem With China's CRISPR Experiment\nWatch this video on YouTube\nIn 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced that he had used CRISPR gene-editing technology to alter the DNA of twin babies, aiming to make them immune to HIV. This was hailed as a groundbreaking application of genetic engineering, sparking intense debate within the scientific community. However, upon further investigation, it was revealed that He had violated numerous ethical guidelines, and his experiment was widely condemned for its lack of transparency and disregard for safety protocols.\nHis actions led to a swift backlash, and he was sentenced to prison by Chinese authorities. His experiment raised serious ethical questions about gene editing, particularly regarding its application to human embryos, and prompted global calls for stricter regulations on gene-editing research. The CRISPR baby scandal underscored the ethical complexities of genetic modification and the need for responsible oversight in this powerful field. [10]",

    "text": "Canalys数据显示，今年第二季度，印度首次成为美国智能手机的最大供应国，占据44%的市场份额。三星电子主要生产基地越南排名第二，份额为30%。中国组装的手机份额从2024年第二季度的61%大幅下降至2025年第二季度的25%，排在第三。\n分析师指出，这一显著变化源于苹果大幅提升印度产能，以及智能手机厂商因关税担忧而提前囤货。中印越电子企业协会秘书长杨述成去年提到，受工人效率、技术设备成熟度和供应链完善程度等因素的影响，印度工厂的良率与中国大陆和越南相比有10%左右的差距，但整体情况仍在苹果的可控范围内。",

    "title": "GPT-4o de OpenAI confronté à des problèmes de régression, performance à la hauteur de GPT-4o Mini",
    "text": "Selon un nouveau rapport de Analyse artificielle le grand modèle de langage phare d’OpenAI pour ChatGPT, GPT-4o, a considérablement régressé ces dernières semaines, mettant les performances du modèle de pointe à égalité avec le modèle GPT-4o-mini, beaucoup plus petit et nettement moins performant. Cette analyse intervient moins de 24 heures après que la société a annoncé une mise à niveau du modèle GPT-4o. « La capacité d’écriture créative du modèle s’est améliorée : une écriture plus naturelle, engageante et adaptée pour améliorer la pertinence et la lisibilité. » OpenAI a écrit sur X. « Il est également plus efficace de travailler avec des fichiers téléchargés, en fournissant des informations plus approfondies et des réponses plus approfondies. » La question de savoir si ces affirmations continuent de tenir est désormais mise en doute.\nVidéos recommandées\n« Nous avons terminé hier l’exécution de nos évaluations indépendantes sur la version GPT-4o d’OpenAI et mesurons systématiquement des scores d’évaluation sensiblement inférieurs à ceux de la version d’août de GPT-4o », indique le communiqué. Analyse artificielle annoncée via un post X jeudi, notant que l’indice de qualité de l’analyse artificielle du modèle a diminué de 77 à 71 (et est désormais égal à celui du GPT-4o mini).\nDe plus, les performances de GPT-4o sur le benchmark GPQA Diamond ont diminué de 51 % à 39 %, tandis que ses benchmarks MATH ont diminué de 78 % à 69 %.\nSimultanément, les chercheurs ont découvert que la vitesse de réponse du modèle avait plus que doublé, passant d’environ 80 jetons de sortie par seconde à environ 180 jetons/s. « Nous avons généralement observé des vitesses nettement plus rapides le jour du lancement pour les modèles OpenAI (probablement en raison de la capacité de provisionnement d’OpenAI avant l’adoption), mais nous n’avions pas vu auparavant une différence de vitesse 2x », ont écrit les chercheurs.\nAttendez, le nouveau GPT-4o est-il un modèle plus petit et moins intelligent ?\nNous avons terminé hier nos évaluations indépendantes sur la version GPT-4o d’OpenAI et mesurons systématiquement des scores d’évaluation sensiblement inférieurs à ceux de la version d’août de GPT-4o.\nGPT-4o (novembre) vs GPT-4o (août) :\n➤… pic.twitter.com/gjY2pBFuUv\n– Analyse artificielle (@ArtificialAnlys) 21 novembre 2024\n« Sur la base de ces données, nous concluons qu’il est probable que le modèle GPT-4o d’OpenAI du 20 novembre soit un modèle plus petit que la version d’août », ont-ils poursuivi. « Étant donné qu’OpenAI n’a pas réduit les prix de la version du 20 novembre, nous recommandons aux développeurs de ne pas déplacer les charges de travail de la version d’août sans des tests minutieux. »\nGPT-4o a été lancé pour la première fois en mai 2024 pour surpasser les modèles GPT-3.5 et GPT-4 existants. Selon OpenAI, GPT-4o offre des résultats de référence de pointe dans les tâches vocales, multilingues et visuelles, ce qui le rend idéal pour les applications avancées telles que la traduction en temps réel et l’IA conversationnelle.",

    "text": "[Portugal-Croácia](/tag/Portugal-Cro%25C3%25A1cia) Liga das Nações: Portugal-Croácia, 2-1 (crónica) Começar com energia e acabar na reserva Começar com energia e acabar na reserva Depois de um Europeu que soube a pouco, Roberto Martínez tinha prometido uma Seleção cheia de energia e de vontade na rentrée. Na Alemanha não terá faltado vontade a ninguém, mas faltou, seguramente, a energia que nesta quinta-feira se viu no Estádio da Luz. Nas correrias de Nuno Mendes pela esquerda, na disponibilidade física de Diogo Dalot, na capacidade Bruno Fernandes para voltar a liderar uma equipa pelo exemplo e até na maior capacidade associativa de Cristiano Ronaldo. O arranque de Portugal na Liga das Nações não foi perfeito, mas aproximou-se – ainda que por menos tempo do que o desejável – daquilo que os portugueses esperam de tanta matéria-prima de alto quilate. Pela primeira parte impositiva com dois golos, velocidade na circulação de bola e dinâmicas capazes de transtornar a organização defensiva de uma das seleções mais competentes do velho continente. Como no golo de Diogo Dalot, quando o lateral-direito apareceu na zona do ponta de lança para fazer inaugurar as contas ao minuto 7. Por essa altura, Bruno Fernandes já tinha testado Livakovic de meia-distância e, pouco depois, o guarda-redes croata negou com a perna direita o golo 900 de Cristiano Ronaldo que chegaria aos 34 minutos. Com bola, Portugal foi uma equipa desembaraçada e capaz de fugir do óbvio que ajudou a explicar por que razão se ficou 360 minutos a seco há pouco mais de dois meses. Mas, sem bola, denotou dificuldades. Demasiadas. Porque teve pela frente uma seleção competentíssima na arte de a fazer circular e que a empurrou muitas vezes para o limite da área de Diogo Costa. Ainda assim, o resultado ao intervalo – 2-1 (autogolo de Dalot) – penalizava mais a equipa das quinas, que produziu o suficiente para chegar ao descanso com outro conforto. Portugal regressou para a segunda parte com duas caras novas: entraram Nélson Semedo e João Neves; saíram Pedro Neto e Rafael Leão. Na verdade, não foram propriamente substitutos, até porque as dinâmicas da Seleção transformaram-se profundamente a partir daí. Aquilo que de bom a equipa de Roberto Martínez fez na primeira parte faltou-lhe sobretudo na última meia-hora de jogo, talvez também pelos equívocos na forma como o selecionador nacional mexeu para o reatamento. Faltou capacidade para controlar o jogo com bola e, por consequência, para manter a Croácia longe da área de Diogo Costa. A seleção dos Balcãs acabou a noite claramente por cima e mais próxima do empate do que de sofrer um terceiro golo que terminaria com a incerteza que só foi dissipada com o apito final, numa altura as energias de Portugal pareciam na reserva. Não foi mau. Atrevemo-nos a dizer que, face ao histórico recente, até foi bom. Mas era preciso acabar a sofrer assim?",

    "title": "Minnesota Man Who Was Arrested at 16 Exonerated After 19 Years in Prison – ScheerPost",
    "text": "This article was originally published by the Equal Justice Initiative. On December 11, Marvin Haynes was released after 19 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. Mr. Haynes was arrested at 16 years old and was sentenced to life in prison in 2005. No physical evidence linked Mr. Haynes to the 2004 murder of a Minneapolis flower shop employee and he always maintained his innocence, even as detectives interrogated him alone after his arrest and lied to him about the evidence against him. Instead, his conviction rested upon coerced and improper evidence. A surviving witness to the killing described the assailant as a 19 to 22 year old weighing 180 pounds, with cropped hair. At the time, Mr. Haynes was a slight 16-year-old weighing 130 pounds and had an afro. The surviving witness was subsequently presented with a lineup of potential perpetrators and she chose one of the men in the lineup, saying she was 75 to 80% certain the man had committed the killing—but the man had an alibi. Contrary to departmental guidelines, the officers involved in the investigation presented a a second, “unnecessarily suggestive” line up using a two-year-old photo of Mr. Haynes in which he had short hair, not the afro he had at the time of the killing. The witness then identified [Mr. Haynes](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=6718). Prosecutors pushed ahead on this evidence and the statements of two additional witnesses, both 14-year-old boys. The two boys later provided sworn affidavits that detectives had pressured them into making statements implicating Mr. Haynes, including by threatening them with criminal charges if they did not cooperate. One of the boys, who had been placed in a jail cell while officers worked to extract a statement implicating Mr. Haynes, even tried to recant his statement at trial, but prosecutors threatened him again with potential prison time. This week, nearly two decades after Mr. Haynes’s trial, prosecutors agreed that Mr. Haynes was innocent and that the State was wrong to arrest and prosecute him, acknowledging that the actual culprit has remained free for the last 20 years. Mr. Hayne’s release follows recent investigations into the Minneapolis Police Department’s history of discriminating against Black people and engaging in widespread abuses that culminated in the killing of George Floyd in 2020. As EJI has documented, [wrongful convictions](https://eji.org/issues/wrongful-convictions/) are one manifestation of our nation’s legacy of racial injustice and the presumption of dangerousness and guilt assigned particularly to young Black men and boys. As a result, innocent Black people are about seven times more likely to be wrongfully convicted than innocent white people and nearly half of all exonerees are Black. “There was a terrible injustice done in this case,” said Mary Moriarty, the Hennepin County Attorney. Her office agreed with Mr. Hayne’s attorneys to request that a local court vacate his conviction and grant his release, and the Hennepin County district judge granted the request. “Sometimes doing the right thing means we must seek to undo the harms of the past, not defend them,” Ms. Moriarty added. “I always knew I was going to find a way to get justice,” Mr. Haynes said, but that perseverance was costly for both him and his family. According to his sister, the family was forced to invest all their savings. Mr. Haynes is now seeking compensation from the state for the injustice inflicted upon him.

    "title": "Rising layoffs? The surge in jobless claims may have been a mirage.",
    "text": "Rising layoffs? The surge in jobless claims may have been a mirage. Remember that spike in jobless claims — aka layoffs — since the end of the school year? The surge in unemployment filings spawned fears about a worsening labor market and a weakening economy. But not to worry, the most recent reports suggest. The surge in jobless claims appears to have been just a temporary one tied to seasonal changes in the economy and the occasional major storm. The numbers tell the story. Just one month ago, actual jobless claims hit a one-year high of 280,555. They had been tracking in the 190,000s before the school year ended. Fast forward to last week, and only 199,530 people actually applied for unemployment benefits. It was the first time actual claims had dipped below 200,000 since the end of May. These figures reflect raw filings at state employment agencies before the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics applies seasonal adjustments (the seasonally adjusted total last week was higher at 227,000). What’s going on? Jobless claims have shown a historical pattern of rising in the early spring and peaking in midsummer before tapering off in the fall. This pattern seems to have been especially pronounced the past two years. The end of the school year appears to be one of the triggers since lots of people are entering or leaving the labor force. The summer is also when auto plants shut down for a few weeks to retool for new models. Some big auto-producing states allow workers to apply for temporary benefits. Michigan, for example, saw a big increase in jobless claims in July. The sporadic storm during hurricane season can also cause jobless claims to jump. Hurricane Beryl sent new unemployment filings soaring in Texas last month, but now most people have gone back to work. “The reduction in initial claims in the first two weeks of August strongly suggests that the rise in initial claims in July was overstated,” said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial Services. He noted that the same pattern took place last year. There’s no guarantee, of course, that layoffs won’t start to rise if the economy slows further. Businesses are hiring fewer people than at any time since the pandemic and job openings have fallen by one-third since hitting a record high a few years ago. A tepid increase in new jobs in July even raised fresh worries about a recession. Yet there’s no indication layoffs are marching higher. The rate of layoffs in June, for instance, matched a record low 0.9 in June, according to the government’s job-openings report. Typically the rate ranges from 1.2 to 1.4 in good economic times. Why are layoffs so low? The U.S. recently experienced its worst labor shortage ever and companies struggled mightily to find workers. Companies won’t easily resort to layoffs, economists say, given how hard it was to hire people in the first place. It would take a decline in sales or the threat of recession to prod them into firing more workers, economists say. “The bottom line is that, while the labor market is clearly cooling as firms slow the pace of hiring, layoffs remain historically low,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Santander Capital Markets.",
