    "text": "Former Corrie star [Helen Flanagan](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/helen-flanagan) bravely faced a 16-hour flight to Bali with her three young children after she was reunited with them. Her three kids, Matilda, seven, Delilah, five, and Charlie, two, had spent Christmas Day with their dad, Helen’s ex-partner Bristol Rovers footballer Scott Sinclair. It had been the [first Christmas Helen had spent apart from her little ones](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/helen-flanagans-children-spend-christmas-8987298). Helen candidly shared her feelings of loneliness with her followers over Christmas, as she revealed she wasn’t in the mood to celebrate while apart from her children. The [I'm A Celebrity star](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here) spent seven days without them and confessed she felt “weird without the kids” this year, but vowed to have a different experience in 2024. The 33-year-old was finally reunited with her children on Wednesday (December 27) as they prepared to jet off to Bali for a special holiday to see in the New Year.

Wearing a pair of grey shorts and a hoodie, the actress beamed as she held her youngest daughter Delilah in her arms, while her friend carried Charlie, and Matilda stood on the luggage trolley to pose for the photo, reports The Mirror. She documented the gruelling 16-hour flight on her Instagram Story, as she confessed she was “so tired” while struggling to keep her young children occupied. Sharing a clip of her with Charlie sitting on her lap, Helen looked exasperated as she tried to get comfortable with her toddler. Just a few minutes later, she posted another video, showing Delilah on her knee while little Charlie slept soundly on the seat next to her. Helen then shared a short clip showing her cradling Charlie as she assured one of her daughters that they were “going to the hotel in a minute”. The former I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here star then wrote atop the video: “20 million hour flight done. Charlie was a dream, it was really hard work all the other flights this year but my boy is three in March so starting to watch films and wear headphones.” “Wasn’t really feeling Christmas this year, felt weird without the kids but next year I’ll be festive,” she wrote, as she shared snaps from the last week. In one snap, she revealed she had “drank too much” on a night out, and ended up in the bath nursing her hangover. In another photo, she flashed the peace sign as she touched upon her battle with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, as she thanked Vicky Pattison for encouraging her to get help with the condition. “Finally doing something about my PMDD Thankyou @vickypattison for being a support,” she explained. Helen shared details of co-parenting at Christmas in a recent interview with Closer magazine, as she said the kids would be spending Christmas Day with dad Scott and his mother. “I won't have them for about four days. It will actually be the first Christmas that I don't have my children,” she sadly added.",

Los habitantes suman dos días realizando este tipo de manifestaciones en la entidad para exigir la localización de los efectivos de la Guardia Comunitaria .\nLa Secretaría de Seguridad Pública (SSP) de Michoacán detalló que, en coordinación con la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Sedena), Guardia Nacional (GN), Fiscalía General del Estado (FGE), así como elementos de corporaciones municipales, ampliaron e intensificaron la búsqueda para localizar a los siete policías comunales del municipio de Tangamandapio.\n(Foto: Secretaría de Seguridad Michoacán) Los trabajos de búsqueda, que se desarrollan en Tangamandapio y municipios aledaños, incluyen el despliegue de personal, un helicóptero, recursos operativos, técnicos, materiales y tecnológicos disponibles.\nLos siete policías desaparecieron mientras patrullaban una carretera que conduce a la cabecera municipal de Santiago Tangamandapio, por lo que la Fiscalía de Michoacán presentó fichas de búsqueda y activó una Alerta Alba y Alerta Naranja, debido a que son seis hombres y una mujer.\nLos policías comunitarios desaparecidos fueron identificados como Brayan Javier Hernández Pablo, de 22 años; Óscar Martínez Cuellar, de 30; Luis Fernando Lucas Maravilla, de 27; Israel Maravilla Juan, de 51; Ricardo Ángel Ascensio Bravo, de 22; Marco Antonio Reyes Amezcua, de 48; y Patricia Mateo Victoriano, de 33.\nLos reportes preliminares señalan que el comandante Antonio Reyes Amezcua, de 48 años, salió de la comunidad rumbo a Tangamandapio, pero en el trayecto su vehículo se descompuso por lo que cerca de las 15: 00 horas, seis elementos acudieron a auxiliar al mando policial a bordo de una patrulla y desde entonces se desconoce su paradero.\n(Foto: Secretaría de Seguridad Michoacán) Los reportes, que no han sido confirmados por las autoridades, también apuntan a que sujetos armados fueron quienes plagiaron a los uniformados.\nEl gobernador de Michoacán, Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla, enfatizó que se están utilizando todos los recursos disponibles para localizar a los policías.\nDe acuerdo con el diario Milenio, las autoridades se apoyan de drones de última generación que operan en terrenos complicados y que capturan imágenes detalladas desde el aire.\nDentro de la descripción de esta tecnología, según el medio, los drones permiten monitorear zonas montañosas y forestales donde se teme que los policías pudieran estar privados de su libertad.",

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "title": "Canada Welcomes Over 300 Afghan Refugees in a Major Resettlement Effort - Khaama Press",
    "text": "Canada marked a significant step in its humanitarian efforts by welcoming 314 Afghan nationals on a charter flight from Pakistan to Saskatoon on Thursday. This initiative, facilitated by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), is part of a larger commitment to resettling Afghan refugees in various Canadian communities, including Ottawa, Surrey, and Toronto. Since August 2021, following the Taliban’s return to power and the subsequent U.S. withdrawal after two decades of conflict, Canada has been instrumental in offering refuge to more than 45,000 Afghans. The Taliban regime has imposed severe restrictions, particularly on women, limiting their access to education and barring them from most areas of public life and employment. Among the arrivals in Saskatoon was Irfanullah Noori, who, along with 113 other refugees, had been waiting for 18 months in Islamabad to complete travel documentation. Noori, whose family members, including his father and brother previously employed by the Canadian army in Afghanistan, had arrived in Canada months earlier, expressed relief and happiness about his journey to Canada. “I came to Canada to have a better future, to study, and to support my family,” Noori said, though he voiced concerns about relatives still in Afghanistan under the Taliban’s rule. Pakistan’s recent policy to deport undocumented foreigners, including more than 450,000 Afghans since last November, underscores the importance and timeliness of Canada’s initiative. For Noori, who has family members in Saskatoon, the resettlement process may be smoother. However, for many without such connections, the transition poses more challenges. The Saskatoon Open Door Society (SODS), led by CEO Ali Abukar, is at the forefront of these resettlement efforts. With a team of 150 staff and community volunteers, SODS is committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of these vulnerable individuals. “Our main job is to do initial settlement for refugees. And we also connect them with services, we help them with setup,” Abukar explained. Of the new arrivals, around 40 will stay in Saskatoon, 50 are destined for other cities within Saskatchewan, and the remainder will be resettled across the country. Community volunteers, like John Guselle, also played a significant role, offering their time and support at the airport to assist the newcomers with their initial needs. SODS has appealed to the community for further support through donations of time or money, emphasizing the collective responsibility in aiding these new members of Canadian society.",

    "text": "El Centro Nacional de Huracanes informó que hay un 70% de probabilidades de que Invest 97L se convierta en una depresión tropical. (NHC) El gobernador de Florida , Ron DeSantis , declaró el estado de emergencia en 54 de los 67 condados del estado en preparación para la posible llegada de la tormenta Invest 97L . Esta decisión busca anticiparse a una potencial “amenaza significativa” ante el comienzo de lo que podría ser una temporada de huracanes violenta.\nSegún detalló Tallahassee Democrat, DeSantis firmó una orden ejecutiva el pasado jueves en la que menciona el peligro inminente de lluvias intensas en gran parte de Florida, con pronósticos que indican la posibilidad de que caigan hasta 30 centímetros de precipitación en los próximos siete días, lo cual podría causar graves inundaciones en los ríos y otras zonas vulnerables del estado. De acuerdo con la orden: “Los niveles freáticos en las áreas afectadas ya están cerca de su capacidad máxima y las fuertes lluvias que se avecinan causarán importantes inundaciones en los ríos que podrían durar varias semanas”.\nPor su parte, el Centro Nacional de Huracanes (NHC) informó que existe un 70% de probabilidades de que la tormenta Invest 97L se convierta en una depresión tropical dentro de la semana, ya sea cerca de Florida o sobre el este del Golfo de México. Este organismo añadió que hay un 30% de probabilidades de que el desarrollo ocurra en las próximas 48 horas.\nEl medio local FOX 35 Orlando , explicó en su cobertura que este sistema tropical estaba generando una amplia zona de lluvias y tormentas eléctricas desorganizadas en áreas como La Española, Puerto Rico y el sureste de las Bahamas. El servicio meteorológico advirtió que, aunque la tormenta podría no evolucionar a un huracán de gran magnitud, las lluvias intensas podrían dejar a Florida sin servicio durante varios días y provocar posibles inundaciones dañinas.\nProbabilidad del 30% en las próximas 48 horas que el Invest 97L se convierta en depresión tropical. (NHC) En una publicación en la red social X, el gobernador DeSantis instó a los residentes a seguir las directrices emitidas por la División de Gestión de Emergencias de Florida y los funcionarios locales. “Florida está monitoreando el Invest 97L en el Atlántico, que se espera que se fortalezca y potencialmente toque tierra este fin de semana. Avanzará lentamente y traerá abundantes lluvias que podrían provocar inundaciones importantes. Animo a todos los residentes a prepararse para la tormenta y seguir todas las directrices emitidas por @FLSERT y los funcionarios locales de gestión de emergencias”, escribió el gobernador.\nLa orden ejecutiva del gobernador DeSantis no solo busca actuar con rapidez ante el riesgo de malas condiciones climáticas, sino que también permite una mayor flexibilidad a los gobiernos estatales y locales para coordinar sus agencias de emergencia, y relajar restricciones y procedimientos burocráticos, garantizando así una respuesta más eficiente ante la amenaza climática.\nRon DeSantis es precisa al mencionar que la declaración de un estado de emergencia hace posible movilizar y reasignar recursos de manera más expedita para enfrentar peligros inminentes que los servicios locales no pueden manejar por sí solos. Además, la orden designa como oficial coordinador estatal al Director Ejecutivo de la División de Gestión de Emergencias, otorgándole la autoridad para ejecutar el Plan Integral de Gestión de Emergencias del estado así como otros planes necesarios para abordar la emergencia.\nLos condados declarados en estado de emergencia incluyen: Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Calhoun, Charlotte, Citrus, Clay, Collier, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Hernando, Hillsborough, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Lake, Lee, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Manatee, Marion, Monroe, Nassau, Okaloosa, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Johns, Sumter, Suwannee, Taylor, Union, Volusia, Wakulla, Walton y Washington.\nEl gobernador DeSantis publicó en la red social X instando a seguir las directrices de emergencia por la tormenta Invest 97L. (REUTERS/Marco Bello) El NHC y otros expertos instan a los habitantes de la costa del Golfo y la costa atlántica de los Estados Unidos a mantener una vigilancia constante sobre el sistema. Adicionalmente, el meteorólogo Noah Bergren , del equipo de tormentas de FOX 35 , destacó: “Todos en Florida deben vigilar de cerca el clima, ya que un sistema tropical podría fortalecerse a medida que pase sobre aguas históricamente cálidas del Golfo de México, con vientos cortantes más ligeros en altura. Al menos ahora es probable que se produzca una tormenta tropical. Los detalles sobre un posible fortalecimiento adicional, trayectorias específicas, cualquier pérdida de sustentación y el área de mayor impacto aún no están claros. Dicho esto, parece que el domingo, el lunes y el próximo martes son los principales plazos para impactos tropicales directos en Florida ”.\nLa orden ejecutiva también destaca la importancia de mantener informadas a todas las agencias gubernamentales estatales, regionales y locales sobre las medidas que deben tomar frente a la emergencia, prohibiendo formalmente el precio excesivo de los productos esenciales necesarios ante la eventualidad. Además, el secretario del Departamento de Transporte de Florida tiene la facultad para suspender el cobro de peajes y la Guardia Nacional de Florida está activada para asistir con las operaciones necesarias.\nPara aquellos interesados en conocer más a fondo la orden ejecutiva completa, el detalle se encuentra disponible en el sitio web del gobernador de Florida.",
