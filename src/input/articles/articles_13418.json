    "text": "La Comisión de Tránsito del Ecuador (CTE) ha difundido en su cuenta en la plataforma X, antes Twitter, información sobre la ubicación de 39 radares que desde este martes, 4 de junio, dejaron de generar multas en tres provincias: Los Ríos, El Oro y Cañar. La entidad suspendió el registro del valor de multas de tránsito captadas por estas cámaras que corresponden a los contratos con los consorcios Seviecu y Ecutransit. [CTE suspende el registro del valor de multas de tránsito de 39 radares desde este martes, 4 de junio](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/ecuador/39-radares-cte-suspende-registro-del-valor-de-multas-de-transito-nota/) La decisión se adoptó luego de que, ante una alerta de presuntas irregularidades en el concurso y manejo de los radares a nivel nacional, la Secretaría General de Integridad Pública dispusiera acciones que involucran a las instancias de control del Estado ecuatoriano. Publicidad A la ciudadanía:— Comisión de Tránsito 🇪🇨 (@CTEcuador) [#ElNuevoEcuadorResuelve] [pic.twitter.com/utxKjIPWvg] [June 6, 2024] Dicha instancia ha pedido la revisión de los contratos de delegación de radares en las vías estatales del país que se gestionaron en el Gobierno anterior y, según el régimen actual, se elaboró en un tiempo récord para la contratación pública (42 días), inobservando las normativas legales vigentes. La CTE señaló que solicitará a la Contraloría que realice a la brevedad posible un examen especial al referido concurso de delegación a gestores privados y a los respectivos contratos. En Los Ríos hay 19 dispositivos de control de velocidad; en El Oro, 4; y, en Cañar, 16. Publicidad Los Ríos: - Vía Palestina-Vinces (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Ventanas parroquia Zapotal. - Vía Buena Fe-Patricia Pilar, sector hacienda Reybanpac (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Buena Fe-gasolinera Buena Fe. - Vía Vinces-Palenque. - Vía Quevedo-Buena Fe. - Vía Baba-Pita. - Vía General Vernaza-Baba (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Buena Fe-Santo Domingo, sector Patricia Pilar. - Ventanas-Quevedo, sector Lechugal. - Valencia-La Maná, sector av. 13 de Diciembre. - Buena Fe-Quevedo, sector Guayacanes. - Babahoyo-Montalvo (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Valencia-Quevedo, sector La Esperanza (radares capta ambos sentidos de la vía). El Oro: - Santa Rosa-Huaquillas, sector redondel Santa Rosa. - Santa Rosa-Huaquillas, sector La Avanzada. - El Guabo-Santa Rosa, sector Tillales (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). Cañar: - Paso Lateral La Troncal. - Vía Manuel de J. Calle (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Vía Puerto Inca, sector La Puntilla. - Carretera Panamericana, sector Ingonilla (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Carretera Panamericana, sector La Troncal. - Carretera Panamericana, sector El Tambo (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Autopista Azogues-Biblián (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Autopista Azogues, sector puente río Burgay (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). - Vía Zhud Suscal-La Troncal, sector Cercapota. - Autopista Azogues-Dr. Camilo Gallegos Domínguez (radares captan ambos sentidos de la vía). [‘En nuestra lucha contra la corrupción rechazamos el contrato de delegación de radares de la CTE’, dice Secretaría de Integridad Pública sobre equipos de control de velocidad en las vías](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/ecuador/secretaria-integridad-publica-rechaza-contrato-radares-cte-ecuador-nota/) El resto de radares distribuidos en otras provincias, como Guayas, Santa Elena, Azuay, Tungurahua, Manabí y Cotopaxi, se mantienen vigentes y, por tanto, generan multas en caso de detectar infracciones. Expertos en seguridad hacen un llamado a los conductores a que independientemente del funcionamiento de los radares respeten los límites de velocidad para evitar siniestros y víctimas mortales. (I)",
