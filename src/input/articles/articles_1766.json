    "text": "CINCINNATI ( WXIX /Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Tropical Cyclone Chido intensified as it barreled toward the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte on its way toward Mozambique’s northern coastline, the French meteorological service said, with wind gusts of up to 260 kilometers (160 miles) per hour. The storm’s top sustained wind speeds of 185 kilometers per hour, estimated by Météo France on Friday, would make it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. The storm is expected to regain strength on Saturday after passing Mayotte, before striking Mozambique the following day. Chido threatens Mozambique’s northern ports of Pemba and Nacala when it makes landfall, potentially lashing the coast with winds of up to 220 kilometers an hour, the southern African nation’s meteorological institute said in a statement Friday. It could dump as much as 250 millimeters (10 inches) of rain over a period of 24 hours, the institute said. Nacala is Mozambique’s biggest export hub for coal, the nation’s top foreign exchange earner. The storm will strike as Mozambique struggles to contain the worst political unrest in decades after disputed elections in October. The demonstrations were affecting humanitarian operations in the Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces that Chido will likely impact, according to the European Commission’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre. Cabo Delgado is also home to an Islamic State-linked insurgency and a liquefied natural gas facility that Eni SpA operates. The storm will be the first to make landfall in Mozambique in the current season that starts in November and runs until the end of April. Météo France’s specialized regional center in October forecast there’ll be more cyclones than average in the southwest Indian Ocean this season, with between four and seven expected. ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "text": "Shares of JD.com ( JD 2.74% ) jumped as much as 5.2% early Thursday then settled to trade up 2.8% as of 3:45 p.m. ET after the Chinese e-commerce giant revealed it's planning sweeping raises for its front-line staff next year.\nIn a post to its official WeChat account this morning, JD.com said it will nearly double the fixed salaries for its procurement, sales, and other front-line staff beginning Jan. 1, 2024. JD.com also said its retail staff will receive 20%+ pay increases.\nA vote of confidence from JD.com The market appears to be taking this development as an encouraging vote of confidence in JD.com's growth trajectory. JD.com has struggled to drive top-line growth in recent quarters -- with revenue last quarter rising a modest 1.7% year over year -- amid fierce competition and macroeconomic uncertainty that has dampened consumer spending in China.\nAt the same time, however, JD.com shares surged earlier this month after the Chinese government initiated new stimulus measures designed to stimulate the country's economic growth and bolster its struggling property sector. If these significant pay raises are any indication, perhaps JD.com is already seeing some of the early positive impact of those stimulus measures.\nWhat's next for JD.com investors? JD.com should be slated to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results in early March. On the former, most analysts are modeling an accelerated 6.2% increase in quarterly revenue, which would mean a slight (0.2%) decline in revenue for all of 2023.\nMost analysts will be more focused, however, on any clarity JD.com management can give investors with regard to growth in the coming year. With consensus estimates on Wall Street calling for a return to top-line growth of 6.8% for 2024, any incremental optimism would be well received by shareholders looking for JD.com's growth headwinds to abate.",

    "text": "(CNN) — A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday.\nThe wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away.\nNearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\nHigh water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said.\nWaves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n“Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nCrews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities.\nHoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution.\nIn central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office issued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nThe most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday.\nTempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised.\nA high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected.\nRainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having some of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner told the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said.\n“The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.”\nMavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells.\nThe legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen.\nOn Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco.\n“If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.”\n(Copyright (c) 2023 CNN.

Online therapy services like BetterHelp are some of podcasting’s biggest advertisers, promising to address the barriers that prevent people from accessing face-to-face therapy. Now, the American company is expanding its app into Australia – recruiting Australian psychologists while capitalising on the failings of a mental health system that’s difficult to navigate. But are patients actually better off with subscription-based therapy apps? Today, clinical and forensic psychologist Dr Ahona Guha on the dangers of app-based mental health support and what happens when you turn psychologists into gig-economy workers. Socials: Stay in touch with us on Guest: Clinical and forensic psychologist, Dr Ahona Guha. Background Reading While the pandemic proved online mental healthcare has its place, the rise of subscription therapy apps is intensifying concerns about the quality of care that is being dispensed.

    "title": "Guled Mire: How a new show made me feel seen as a Muslim NZer",
    "text": "The debut of Miles From Nowhere, a six-part comedy series, marks a pivotal moment in New Zealand’s media and entertainment landscape, writes Re: News contributor Guled Mire.\nIt authentically portrays the diverse facets of the Muslim community. Speaking with the creators and cast of the show, Guled delves into its origins and the transformative impact it has on the representation and perception of Muslims in New Zealand.\nLast week, Miles From Nowhere was released on Sky Open and Neon.\nSet against Auckland's urban backdrop, it explores the themes of identity, love, and belonging through comedy.\nAt its core is Said, portrayed by Arlo Green, whose struggles mirror the struggles of being a New Zealander.\nSaid has been dumped by his girlfriend and is finding it hard to land a job while juggling his dreams of being an indie musician — and the demands of his Muslim upbringing.\nSaid's world is upended when a misunderstood mosque livestream lands him on a security watchlist.\nAmid the chaos, an unlikely friendship blossoms between Said and an SIS officer, challenging stereotypes and assumptions of one another.\nHow it all started The inception of Miles From Nowhere traces back to a serendipitous encounter in London and on the set of the award-winning Re: News series, Third Culture Minds – a three-part exploration of the mental health and wellbeing outcomes among migrant and refugee youth.\nIn an episode, Mohamed Hassan — an award-winning journalist and poet, who happens to also be Muslim — talked about the toll it took on his mental wellbeing reporting on Islamophobia and shed light on the struggles faced by individuals navigating the complex intersection of identity and media representation.\nIn the lead up to filming this episode, I was caught in the hustle of London’s traffic — while Mohamed Hassan and filmmaker Ahmed Osman, two strangers to each other, had a conversation that would pave the way for the emergence of Miles From Nowhere.\nThis encounter led to a bold vision: to create a television series that would challenge stereotypes, amplify marginalised voices, and foster empathy and understanding in a world plagued by division and discord.\nInspired by their shared vision and driven by a desire to effect change, Mohamed Hassan and Ahmed Osman forged ahead, joined by comedian Aamer Rahman.\nTogether, they established Homegrown Pictures, a production company dedicated to amplifying diverse narratives and challenging societal norms.\nThey spent a year engaging in weekly brainstorm sessions, crafting a script before pitching it to executives.\n'Almost everything we depict is rooted in truth' Comedy is a powerful vehicle to navigate heavy subjects in Miles From Nowhere, engaging audiences and offering a deeper understanding of the full range of experiences within the Muslim community.\nCreator Mohamed Hassan said: \"We believe in comedy's power to navigate heavy subjects in a palatable way.”\nAs a journalist, he has covered stories on racial profiling and surveillance.\nThe decision to incorporate themes of surveillance and discrimination aimed to shed light on overlooked realities, he said.\n“These narratives, though hard to believe, unfold in our midst,” he said.\n\"Almost everything we depict is rooted in truth.”\nA celebration of culture, creativity and collective achievement Two days before the official release, an exclusive screening and Q&A session was held for the cast, crew, and their families\nAs I stepped into the historic The Hollywood Avondale, the air buzzed with anticipation and excitement.\nFor me, the release of Miles From Nowhere holds a deeply personal significance.\nMuslims have been relegated to the sidelines of mainstream media and our stories are reduced to stereotypes and caricatures.\nIn the aftermath of the Christchurch terror attacks, I found myself thrust into the unforgiving spotlight of media scrutiny, tasked with representing a community grappling with grief and trauma.\nAmong the chaos and confusion, too often our voices were drowned out by the noise of sensationalism and fear-mongering.\nA world of vibrant characters and compelling narratives As the lights dimmed and the first episode of Miles From Nowhere began, I was drawn into a world of vibrant characters and compelling narratives invoking laughter and moments of profound reflection.\nThrough the show’s characters like Ahmad, Marwa, and Shadia, Miles From Nowhere offers an exploration of the immigrant experience, showing the highs and lows of those caught between cultures.\nAhmad, a close friend of Said, is played by Sami Afuni.\nAhmad’s story resonated deeply with me, his journey mirroring my own struggles - a path shaped by the push and pull of competing identities, the search for belonging, and the pursuit of authenticity in a world of shifting norms and expectations.\nMarwa, played by Roxie Mohebbi, a familiar face from Shortland Street, also spoke to me too.\nIn the series, Marwa is Said’s ex and finds herself playing a key role in her local community’s response to moments of crises.\nShe defies societal norms and expectations, serving as a leader and voice for her community, celebrating the resilience of Muslim women often overlooked in mainstream media.\nThrough Marwa’s story, I found inspiration and empowerment.\nAnd then I saw echoes of my own mother in Shadia, Said’s mother played by Sherin Darwish. I saw her joys and sorrows, fears and hopes, and unwavering love that transcends time and space.\nRunning the panel discussion at the Miles From Nowhere launch When you’re from a community that’s been marginalised, it’s easy to get used to the stereotypes - and in the media landscape, we often find ourselves falling into a role the mainstream want us to play, or having them box us in there.\nArlo Green, the actor who plays Said, said \"once I read the script and learned about the team behind it, I knew I had to be a part of it”.\n\"It felt like it wasn't going to be stereotypical. It felt like it was going to be something aspirational.\"\nDirector Ghazaleh Golbakhsh said: \"When I read the script, I'll be honest, I was like, 'Wow, this is so good’.\n\"It was really exciting to come on board and kind of show love to our community and the people in it but also take the piss at the same time, which I kind of love doing.\"\nA sense of kinship Behind the scenes, the cast and crew of Miles From Nowhere found a deeper connection - a sense of kinship born from a shared commitment to authenticity and representation.\nFor Roxie, the path to portraying Marwa with authenticity was riddled with self-doubt and introspection.\n\"I knew I had to do justice to this character but there were moments when I questioned whether I was the right person for the role.\n\"In the end, it was about telling a story that was authentic and true - a story that resonated not only with me but with audiences around the world. I drew from my own experiences, my own struggles and triumphs.”\nSami, who plays Ahmad, offers a glimpse into his own personal journey of cultural identity and representation, recounting his experience as an international student navigating the complexities of life at a boarding school.\n\"I remember feeling like I didn't quite fit in,\" he said.\n\"But it was through acting that I found my voice, my identity - a sense of belonging that transcended borders and boundaries.\"\nThe power of being seen on film We all yearn to witness our lived experiences portrayed with dignity and depth on screen - a shared human desire.\nAnd as the acclaimed American writer and film critic bell hooks famously wrote: “Movies matter because they offer a reflection of our self-perception and a glimpse into how others perceive us.”\nYet, for too long, it has felt as though this dignity and depth were luxuries not afforded to Muslims.\nMiles from Nowhere defies expectations, feeling like a whispered affirmation, a show crafted specifically by us and for us.\nEven the subtle jokes, infused with our shared experiences, carry profound meaning and humour, though they may have flown over the heads of some critics.\nHowever, while Miles From Nowhere offers solace and validation to Muslims like myself, who have longed to be seen, the absence of Black Muslims in the show is a glaring shortcoming that cannot be ignored.\nIt’s a critique the show’s creators are keenly aware of as they turn their thoughts towards season two and the future of the series.\nCreator Mohamed Hassan said: “We want to see more of these stories told, and we want to see the best of these stories told.”\n“I think we’re in a moment right now, in New Zealand, where there is a generation of really hungry creatives that are doing incredible work, whether on television or film, or in any music or art.”\nGuled Mire is an award-winning creative. He is a writer, community advocate and producer/host of Third Culture Minds.",
