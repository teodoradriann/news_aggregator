    "title": "La mayor novedad de WhatsApp por fin en Android: ya podemos decir adiós a los audios molestos",
    "text": "Todos tenemos ese familiar o amigo que envía audios constantemente, o quizás tú mismo eres esa persona (sé que yo lo soy). Si estás cansado de tener que escuchar audios molestos, WhatsApp tiene una solución: ahora podrás leerlos.\nA veces es más fácil explicar algo en forma de audio, o quizás estás caminando por la calle y se te dificulta escribir un mensaje largo. Los audios son muy útiles en estos casos, pero muchas veces quienes los reciben se encuentran en una situación en la que es difícil escucharlo (en el trabajo, en clases o en el transporte público y sin [auriculares](https://www.xatakandroid.com/guias-de-compra/mejores-auriculares-bluetooth-para-usar-movil)). Esto ahora será un problema del pasado, gracias a la nueva transcripción de notas de voz en WhatsApp.\nAsí funciona la transcripción de audios en WhatsApp\nEsta es, sin duda, la mayor novedad de WhatsApp en años. No tengo nada en contra de los audios, ya que suelo enviar muchos, pero muchas veces no puedo escuchar alguno porque me encuentro ocupado o en alguna situación que me lo impide. Leer ese mensaje sería más fácil, sobre todo cuando recibimos esos audios de sólo uno o dos segundos en el que la otra persona sólo dice \"está bien\". ¿Por qué hacen esto?\nAhora WhatsApp permite transcribir los audios, ya no hay que escucharlos, podemos leerlos. Esta función lleva alrededor de un año disponible en la [beta de iOS](https://www.xatakamovil.com/aplicaciones/hace-ano-que-whatsapp-introdujo-su-mejor-novedad-beta-sigue-desaparecida-donde-esta-transcripcion-audios), pero ahora ha debutado en Android, directamente en la versión final de la aplicación; no hace falta tener la beta para utilizarla.\nLo que sí es necesario es tener acceso a[ Meta AI](https://www.xatakandroid.com/comunicacion-y-mensajeria/meta-ai-whatsapp-que-que-ventajas-tiene-como-usarlo); en nuestras pruebas sólo hemos podido utilizar la transcripción de audios en cuentas de WhatsApp con acceso a Meta AI, lo que significa que, al menos por ahora, no es posible acceder de forma oficial a esta herramienta en Europa. En cambio, sí está disponible para dispositivos Android en Latinoamérica y en Estados Unidos.\nPara acceder a la transcripción de audios, seguimos estos pasos:\n- Mantenemos pulsado sobre el mensaje de audio que deseamos transcribir\n- Pulsamos sobre el botón de tres puntos en la esquina superior derecha\n- Seleccionamos 'Transcribir'\nLa primera vez que usemos esta herramienta, tendremos que seleccionar el idioma en el que se transcribirá el audio y descargar los archivos necesarios.\nY eso es todo, ya podemos transcribir los mensajes de audio a texto en Android. A partir de ahora tenemos dos opciones: podemos escuchar esa nota de voz que nos han enviado, o podemos leerla. Esta es, sin duda, una herramienta que llevamos [mucho tiempo esperando](https://www.xatakandroid.com/aplicaciones-android/gran-novedad-notas-voz-whatsapp-llegara-tambien-a-android-saber-que-dice-nota-voz-reproducirla) y que se convertirá en parte de nuestro día a día al usar la aplicación.\nImagen de portada | Creada con DALL-E 3\nEn Xataka Android | [Los 109 mejores packs de stickers para WhatsApp de 2024, cómo descargarlos y de qué manera puedes hacer los tuyos](https://www.xatakandroid.com/tutoriales/mejores-packs-stickers-para-whatsapp-2022)\nEn Xataka Android | [WhatsApp tiene un nueva nueva lupa escondida: dónde está y para qué sirve](https://www.xatakandroid.com/aplicaciones-android/whatsapp-tiene-nueva-nueva-lupa-escondida-sirve-para-comprobar-te-estan-intentando-estafar-enlace)",

    "text": "Pumpkin Morning Glory Muffins are healthy, hearty, and so delicious! Loaded with shredded carrots and apples, they’re so moist! And dried cranberries, warm spices, and crunchy pecans make them extra delicious!\nPumpkin Morning Glory Muffin Recipe\nWhenever pumpkin goes on sale I stock up like a crazy lady. It’s a little obnoxious, but what can I say? I love a good bargain! And as a professional baking blogger, it just makes sense. One can really never have too much pumpkin! Especially in October. Last week I hit the jackpot and found organic pumpkin on sale for 75 cents…\nI bought 20 cans. #noselfcontrol\nSo far I’ve made pumpkin pie, pumpkin cake (recipe coming soon), and pumpkin morning glory muffins. Actually, I’ve made these muffins twice! In 12 days. And I live alone. They’re really that good. Especially with a hot cup of coffee or tea. Actually eating one right now and my key board is a bit of a mess! So many delicious crumbs everywhere.\nTips and Tricks for Recipe Success:\n- These pumpkin morning glory muffins are infinitely adaptable! Can’t find coconut oil? Try using canola oil, or a very mild olive oil. Not a fan of pecans? Use almonds, walnuts, or pistachios instead. No brown sugar in the pantry? Granulated sugar or coconut sugar will work in a pinch! Not crazy about cranberries? Toss in dried cherries or raisins for a tasty swap. You get the picture 😉\n- Unless you have a serious aversion to carrot/apple peels, there’s no need to take the extra step of peeling them. These muffins are delightfully rustic so peels and skins are more than welcome!\n- Be sure your muffins are fully baked before removing them from the oven. My muffins were perfectly done at 27 minutes. These muffins are extremely moist, so they need a little more time in the oven than most muffin recipes.\nHave a wonderful Halloween weekend! Are you dressing up? Going to any fun parties? It’s a work weekend for me, but I’ll be celebrating in spirit. See you tomorrow with PIE.\nMore Muffin Recipes:\nMy Favorite Morning Glory Muffins Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins and Bread Glazed Pumpkin Donut Muffins (Vegan)\nIf you try this recipe, let me know!

    "title": "Preserving Modern Microbes to Inspire Future Scientists",
    "text": "In a groundbreaking development poised to transform our understanding of microbial life, Dr. A.M. Eren has unveiled an innovative approach to preserving modern microbial ecosystems, offering future scientists an unprecedented window into the past. This pioneering work centers on the meticulous preservation of microbial specimens—complex communities of microscopic organisms—that not only thrive in diverse environments today but also hold answers to ecological, evolutionary, and even medical mysteries yet to be unraveled. Published recently in Nature Communications, this research pushes the boundaries of microbiology and conservation biology, bridging temporal scales in a way that few previous studies have managed.\nMicrobial ecosystems, often overlooked due to their minute scale, play a critical role in maintaining Earth’s habitability. These communities execute fundamental biochemical processes such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and even climate regulation. Until now, the ephemeral and dynamic nature of these ecosystems has made it extraordinarily challenging to capture and study them in a state that truly represents their living complexity. Dr. Eren’s work addresses this long-standing barrier by developing preservation techniques that arrest microbial communities at a moment in time, effectively creating a biological “time capsule.”\nThe core of this approach lies in the refinement of cryopreservation and fixation technologies, tailored to maintain structural integrity and viability of microbial consortia. Unlike traditional methods that focus on isolating single microbial strains, Dr. Eren’s methodology preserves entire communities, including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and fungi, embedded within their native environmental matrices. This holistic preservation captures not just individual species, but their intricate interactions, metabolic cooperativity, and spatial organization, which are essential for interpreting microbial ecology authentically.\n.adsslot_fJtWDe4rb2{width:728px !important;height:90px !important;}\n@media(max-width:1199px){ .adsslot_fJtWDe4rb2{width:468px !important;height:60px !important;}\n}\n@media(max-width:767px){ .adsslot_fJtWDe4rb2{width:320px !important;height:50px !important;}\n}\nADVERTISEMENT\nTechnically, the process involves rapid cryogenic freezing at ultra-low temperatures combined with specialized chemical fixatives that stabilize cellular components and extracellular substances. This dual-action strategy mitigates ice crystal formation, which typically disrupts fragile cellular and community structures. The samples are subsequently stored under conditions that prevent degradation, enabling their study even decades after collection. Such long-term viability dramatically expands the temporal horizon for microbial research, making it possible for future scientists to investigate historical microbial ecosystems with the analytical tools of their time.\nOne of the most exciting implications of this preservation technology is its potential to track microbial responses to environmental changes over extended periods. Microbes are especially sensitive indicators of ecosystem health and shifts due to climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. With preserved microbial communities, researchers can retrospectively analyze how these ecosystems have evolved, adapted, or collapsed under various stressors. This ability offers invaluable insights into resilience mechanisms and could inform strategies for restoring damaged environments.\nMoreover, the preserved samples provide a remarkable resource for studying microbial evolution in unprecedented detail. By comparing ancient preserved specimens with contemporary communities, scientists can trace the genetic and functional evolutionary trajectories of microbes. This temporal dimension enhances our understanding of how microbes have co-evolved with their environments and hosts, shedding light on fundamental processes such as horizontal gene transfer, mutation rates, and microbial speciation.\nBeyond ecological and evolutionary significance, Dr. Eren’s technique bears enormous promise for biomedical and biotechnological applications. Microbial communities form the basis of human health, agriculture, and industrial bioprocesses. Access to well-preserved microbial ecosystems will empower future researchers to identify novel microbes, metabolic pathways, and biomolecules that could be harvested for therapeutic or industrial use. It also opens new frontiers in studying the microbiome’s role in disease progression and health maintenance with the advantage of temporal context.\nThe ethical and philosophical ramifications of gifting future scientists microbial communities from our present era are profound. This research underscores a stewardship responsibility to safeguard biological heritage, not just of macroscopic organisms but also of microbial life that underpins planetary ecosystems. The preservation of these microscopic worlds ensures that future generations will have direct access to this diversity, enabling a continuum of knowledge that transcends human lifespans and societal changes.\nDr. Eren’s work also highlights the urgent need for standardized protocols and repositories capable of housing these delicate specimens safely. Just as seed banks and zoological collections conserve plants and animals, microbial libraries are poised to become central repositories for microbial diversity. Such infrastructures will facilitate global collaboration, allowing scientists from various disciplines to share and analyze microbial ecosystems, fostering integrative and interdisciplinary approaches to biological sciences.\nCritically, the research addresses longstanding challenges in microbiome studies related to the reproducibility and comparability of data. Currently, studies of microbial communities often suffer from methodological inconsistencies and temporal variability. The ability to work with preserved reference specimens provides a benchmark for calibrating and validating experimental results, thereby improving the rigor and reliability of microbiome research globally.\nThe impactful nature of this study extends also into environmental policy and conservation strategy design. Authorities tasked with managing biodiversity and ecosystem services may utilize preserved microbial data to inform decision-making processes. As microbial ecosystems substantially influence soil fertility, water quality, and atmospheric dynamics, maintaining their integrity is paramount. The preserved datasets will offer empirical evidence to support policies aimed at minimizing anthropogenic damage and promoting sustainable ecosystem management.\nFurthermore, this preservation method lends itself to exciting possibilities in synthetic biology and bioengineering. By accessing microbial communities from different temporal contexts, synthetic biologists could engineer microbial consortia with tailored functionalities derived from historical metabolic capabilities. This could revolutionize areas such as bioremediation, biofuel production, and biosynthesis of complex natural products, all harnessed from the diversity frozen in time.\nThe significance of Dr. Eren’s contribution cannot be overstated, as it fundamentally alters how we conceptualize and interact with microbial life across epochs. By anchoring microbial ecosystems into preserved specimens, scientists are granted an unprecedented continuity of microbial knowledge, allowing retrospective analyses that enhance predictive models of ecosystem dynamics under future environmental scenarios.\nThis research epitomizes the convergence of microbiology, molecular biology, materials science, and environmental science. It sets a new paradigm wherein biological preservation no longer applies solely to large organisms but encompasses the smallest units of life that sustain planetary health. As this field advances, we anticipate the emergence of microbial paleobiology as a new scientific discipline, offering insights into the ancient biosphere through modern microbial lineage preservation.\nAs the technology matures, public engagement and education about microbial diversity and its conservation will be essential. Increasing awareness about the role microbes play in everyday life and ecosystem functioning could inspire broader societal commitment to microbial ecosystem safeguarding. Dr. Eren’s visionary work serves as a clarion call to recognize and preserve microbial heritage as an integral component of Earth’s biological legacy.\nIn summary, Dr. A.M. Eren’s innovative preservation of modern microbial ecosystems represents a paradigm shift with far-reaching implications for science and society. By granting future scientists access to the living past of microbes, this research opens doors to novel discoveries in ecology, evolution, medicine, and biotechnology. As we stand at the cusp of a new era in microbial research, the ability to conserve microbial communities in their entirety offers an invaluable resource to unravel the physiological mysteries and evolutionary pathways that have sculpted life on Earth.\nSubject of Research: Preservation of modern microbial ecosystems for future scientific study\nArticle Title: Gifting future scientists the past through well-preserved specimens of modern microbial ecosystems\nArticle References:\nEren, A.M.

    "text": "UA Little Rock Graduate Achieves Long-Awaited Master’s Degree and Professional Growth\nAfter a more than a 20-year gap since earning her undergraduate degree, Bobbie Handcock found herself inspired by the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic to return to school and pursue a long-held dream: earning her master’s degree.\nNow a first-generation student from Ohio, Handcock will soon graduate from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock with a [Master of Arts in professional and technical writing](https://ualr.edu/rhetoric/graduate/).\nLike many Americans during the pandemic, Handcock reevaluated her career path in 2021 and decided it was time for a change. Landing a job as a web content specialist at UA Little Rock presented the perfect opportunity to align her professional and academic goals. “Some might say it was kairos — or the opportune time,” Handcock said.\nFrom there, she began to research whether graduate school was the right fit for her. Once she was accepted to the graduate school, Handcock began taking courses online. She also took advantage of student support services at UA Little Rock, including getting a mentor to help her navigate this new phase of learning.\nThrough the professional and technical writing program, Handcock has been able to gain experience on real-world projects and sharpen her skills.\n“One aspect that I love about attending UA Little Rock is the real-world projects I’ve been able to do and the real-world experiences I’ve had,” Handcock said.\nDuring her time in graduate school, she created a style guide for a Pine Bluff business and completed an independent study, where she worked on a grant writing team at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Her courses also helped her become the volunteer marketing coordinator of the HighEdWeb (now Digital Collegium) Leadership Academy, an online program designed to develop leadership skills for digital professionals working in higher education.\n“Pursuing my master’s in professional and technical writing sharpened my skills, making me a more versatile writer, skilled editor, and effective communicator. I’ve had some wonderful professors who helped me expand my expertise in research, editing, document design, grant writing, and writing for social media,” Handcock said.\nThe Lonoke, Arkansas, resident said the most influential person in her graduate school journey has been her husband, Julius.\n“He has supported and encouraged me since day one,” she said. “I could not have done it without him. When I got tired or frustrated, he helped me through it. When I reached a milestone, he celebrated with me.”\nTo other students who want to pursue a graduate degree, Handcock said, “You’ve got this. If you need help, UA Little Rock has so many resources available. I had a graduate student mentor, and I attended the Student Success Fest at the beginning of each semester.”\nThe university has a welcoming environment and is open to students from all walks of life, she said.\n“Whether you’re a nontraditional student like me or just coming out of high school, I truly believe there is a place for you here,” Handcock said.\nThis story was written by Sydney Ambrus.",

    "title": "Canadian Union 'Condemns' Translation Bureau's Plan to Cut More Than 300 Jobs",
    "text": "The Canadian Association of Professional Employees (CAPE) has called on Canada’s Translation Bureau to scratch a five-year business plan that would eliminate more than 300 jobs.\nThe new plan will “directly undermin[e] the rights of francophone Canadians to access information of equal quality to that enjoyed by anglophones and damag[e] the integrity of both official languages in Canada,” CAPE President Nathan Prier said in a statement released on March 20, 2025, the Journée de la Francophonie (Francophonie Day).\nThe Translation Bureau, a federal service under Public Services and Procurement Canada, provides translation and interpreting to both government departments and private clients, primarily from English to French. CAPE, a federal public services union, represents staff translators on Parliament Hill.\nThe Canadian Press reportedly obtained a government document related to the Translation Bureau’s business plan for 2025-2030, which states that, as part of an effort to ensure financial viability, 339 employees will be let go through “natural attrition” over five years.\nAccording to the document, the plan reflects an “overall drop” in demand — specifically for “traditional” translation services.\nThe Translation Bureau reported a 1.34% dip in demand from 120 department agencies in 2022-2023, followed by a 7.78% drop in 2023-2024. Demand is expected to decrease a further 9.38% in 2024-2025 due to government plans to refocus spending; an increase in the rates the Translation Bureau charges for its services; and growing adoption (presumably by other departments) of machine translation tools.\nElections and additional rate increases are expected to decrease demand by a further 2.36% in 2025-2026. The internal document does, however, note that the Translation Bureau plans to keep “key and specialized positions” filled.\nCAPE, on the other hand, said that reducing the Bureau’s staff by nearly a quarter (from an estimated 1,350 in 2024 ) will force translators to work faster with fewer resources, resulting in “an unacceptable decline in quality” that would disproportionately affect French-speakers.\nCBC reported that the Bloc Québécois had voiced similar concerns, citing the Liberals’ elimination of the Department of Official Languages in addition to funding cuts to the Translation Bureau.\n“These are two direct affronts to Quebecers and francophones in Canada,” CBC quoted the Bloc Québécois as saying.\nPublic Servants Have Their Say Per The Canadian Press, other government departments have begun using online translation services (i.e., free internet tools) or are “investing on their own to deploy translation tools powered by artificial intelligence.”\nOn Reddit, users in a space for Canadian public servants shared their own experiences working with the Translation Bureau. The cost was one common complaint:\n“Translation bureau is really expensive. It’s usually less [expensive] to outsource to a private translation firm,” 613_detailer explained.\nTha0bserver agreed emphatically: “I got an estimate from a private supplier yesterday that was literally 1/10 of the quote I got from the translation bureau. ONE TENTH.”\n“I haven’t worked anywhere in the last five years that didn’t use a private third-party contract translation service, redistributing translation demand due to either cost or resource availability at TB,” NotMyInternet wrote, adding that the cuts are “just going to worsen our contracting situation, forcing even more of us to look outside for translation services.”\nSlator Pro Guide: The Future of Language Industry Jobs This 80-page guide analyzes employment trends in the language services and technology industry. Multiple commenters reported better results with Google Translate and, especially, DeepL:\n“The last time I sent something for translation, I got back the EXACT SAME text that I received from Deepl,” KermitsBusiness wrote.\n“The difference is you pay for TB to use DeepL for you,” cheeseworker replied.\n“It’s not always appropriate to do so (ie confidential or classified docs) and obviously for legal or specialized text you will always need a human translator,” Unwholesome_coscomb noted. “But for a random email reminding employees to do their mandatory training? Meh.”\nA few observers, such as Nogreatcathedral, advocated for “more translators embedded in directorates or some similar level.”\n“Even when we send stuff for human translation to the TB, we need a francophone employee to review it for domain accuracy,” they wrote. “If you had embedded translators who were familiar with the domain specific language, you’d take that workload off of francophone analysts and facilitate faster turnaround AI –> human review translation pipelines.”\nOuserhwm concurred: “Even when we pay for proofing, which adds cost – it isn’t perfect. I had embedded translators and they were definitely greatly preferred!”",
