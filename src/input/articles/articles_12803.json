    "title": "Every word from Arteta’s post West Ham presser",
    "text": "Mikel Arteta was in philosophical mood following our 2-0 defeat to West Ham United on Thursday.\nDespite racking up 30 shots over the 90 minutes, we were left frustrated and fell to our first home defeat of the season.\nAfter the game the boss was asked about the game, missed opportunities, VAR decisions and more in his post-match press conference.\nHere’s a full transcript…\nOn the game…\nCongratulate West Ham and praise my players, that’s what I can say. This is football. You look what we’ve done in the game, how much we generated in the game and to see the result is very disappointing, but they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty, three, we had thirty. I don’t know how many touches in the box, how many situations, how many open goals to score and we haven’t. In football you have to do that better if you want to win, and today we haven’t won because of that and for the rest, the team kept trying and had an incredible attitude again.\nOn missing chances….\nIt’s what it is, we have to try to generate. If we don’t score goals in thirty shots, we have to do fifty or sixty to try to score ,it’s the only thing. I cannot imagine a game that you have more dominance, more touches in the box, less situations of the opponents against a really good West Ham side, but today wasn’t enough to win the game.\nOn frustrations from losing after dominating the stats…\nIt is, but this is football, when the team generates that much normally you are going to win games and that’s the way we have done it, because as well against Brighton we generate so much, against Liverpool as well. But we score goals in different ways and we have to make another step in that area to win the game more comfortably for sure, because today the team deserves to win the game, there’s no question about that.\nOn the first goal being awarded after a VAR check…\nI haven’t seen it, the only thing they are saying is that it’s not conclusive the images that they have, it’s just a shame that with the technology that we have that it’s not that clear that we can say yes that it was out or in. It’s done, it’s gone, nothing we can do about it now.\nOn potential need for new signings in January to solve issues with chances…\nWhat we have is the players that we have, it’s the players that I love the most. What we have to do is try to get better situations, and more training, put them there and raise their confidence and that’s it because they have done it.\nOn players lacking confidence in front of goal…\nI don’t think it’s that. You hit the post, or you hit the ball and it’s half a centimetre and you have I don’t know how many shots or someone blocks the shot and it doesn’t come in. We miss a lot of situations when we have to pick the right pass, there are two players free in the box and I can recall five, six actions of that and that’s what makes the difference to win the games.\nOn the camera angles provided to rule the first goal in play…\nI don’t know but the technology we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer. So what we have to do is without that, win the game with the amount of situations that we generate in the game it should have been more than enough.\nOn having a record 77 touches in the box and not scoring…\nThey were great, we have to put the ball in the net and win it, and as well because the two situations in the box we have to defend in the box, we didn’t defend it well enough. It’s a team that are really good in the box, with the timing, the quality they have with the front players arriving and that’s what made the difference today unfortunately and it is a very disappointing night for us because I think we should have got much more from the game.\nCopyright 2023 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.

    "title": "How Relationship Books Can Help You Understand Attachment Styles",
    "text": "In in the present day’s world, relationships play a central function in our well-being and personal development. Yet, many people struggle to build secure, fulfilling relationships resulting from unconscious behaviors rooted in our attachment styles. These attachment styles—patterns in how we bond, join, and respond to intimacy—had been first studied by psychologist John Bowlby and have since turn into a cornerstone in relationship psychology. Fortunately, relationship books are valuable resources to assist us understand and address these patterns, empowering us to domesticate healthier connections. This article explores how relationship books could be instrumental in helping readers understand attachment styles, identify their own, and improve their relationships.\nUnderstanding Attachment Styles\nAttachment styles check with how folks form emotional bonds and interact with others, particularly in romantic relationships. Psychologists commonly establish 4 primary attachment styles: secure, anxious, avoidant, and fearful-avoidant (also known as disorganized).

They tend to form stable, trusting relationships and are usually empathetic and supportive partners.\n– Anxious Attachment: These with an anxious attachment style may crave closeness and worry abandonment, usually feeling insecure about their partner’s commitment.\n– Avoidant Attachment: People with an avoidant attachment style are sometimes uncomfortable with intimacy and worth independence.

By shedding light on these behaviors, relationship books can guide readers toward self-awareness and more fulfilling connections.\nHow Relationship Books Clarify Attachment Theory\nRelationship books simplify advanced psychological theories and supply relatable examples, making it easier for readers to attach with the concepts. Books corresponding to *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, *Hold Me Tight* by Sue Johnson, and *The Attachment Theory Workbook* by Annie Chen provide insight into the origins of attachment styles, how they develop in childhood, and how they manifest in adult relationships.\nFor example, *Attached* breaks down attachment theory into digestible information and presents practical advice for each attachment style. It contains self-assessment tools to assist readers identify their own and their partner’s attachment styles, along with strategies to navigate differences. By understanding one’s attachment style, readers can work on identifying triggers, fostering healthier behaviors, and communicating effectively with their partner.\nBooks like *Hold Me Tight* additionally emphasize the function of emotional bonds in secure attachment. Dr. Sue Johnson, a psychologist and pioneer of Emotionally Centered Therapy (EFT), uses this book to demonstrate how attachment theory could be applied to strengthen emotional connections in relationships. The book provides step-by-step exercises designed to help couples build trust and safety, which are crucial for secure attachments.\nIdentifying and Understanding Your Own Attachment Style\nOne of the crucial powerful ways relationship books assist readers is by helping them identify their own attachment style. Self-assessment exercises and reflective questions permit readers to gain a clearer understanding of their own emotional responses and behaviors in relationships.\nFor instance, many books encourage readers to reflect on their previous relationships, noting patterns of conduct and recurring conflicts. Did they often feel anxious when their partner didn’t reply promptly? Did they discover themselves emotionally distancing when things turned too intense? Recognizing these behaviors and the attachment style associated with them could be transformative.\nBooks on attachment theory assist readers not only to determine their style but in addition to understand why it developed. Many of our attachment styles are rooted in early experiences with caregivers. For example, a person with an anxious attachment style could have had inconsistent caregiving, which led them to develop fears of abandonment. By understanding these origins, readers can gain larger self-compassion and realize that their attachment style is not a flaw but a discovered sample that can be modified with effort.\nCultivating Healthier Relationships\nPast self-awareness, relationship books usually supply concrete advice and exercises to help individuals and couples foster healthier, more secure attachments. For example, some books train readers find out how to regulate emotions, manage triggers, and talk wants more successfully—all essential skills for improving attachment-related issues.\nBooks like *The Attachment Theory Workbook* take a hands-on approach with exercises that guide readers through self-reflection, communication, and emotional regulation. These exercises may also help people with insecure attachment styles be taught healthier ways to approach intimacy and independence. For couples, such books additionally provide guidance on understanding each other’s attachment styles, serving to both partners to meet each other’s wants and navigate potential conflicts constructively.\nEmbracing Change and Growth\nWhile attachment styles are deeply ingrained, they don’t seem to be set in stone. Relationship books emphasize that with awareness and aware effort, individuals can move toward a more secure attachment style. Many readers might find it empowering to realize that they’ve the ability to improve their relationships through self-reflection and change.\nBy gaining perception into attachment theory, individuals can break free from unhealthy relationship patterns, leading to more fulfilling and harmonious connections.

    "text": "Mauricio Pochettino, Chelsea, December 2023\nDean Saunders believes Chelsea “won’t accept” being 10th, and Mauricio Pochettino remains on the chopping block, he just delays his fate for “another two weeks” with every win.\nNone of the managers at Stamford Bridge since Todd Boehly became chairman have dealt particularly well with the swelling of the squad. Boehly has sanctioned £1billion worth of signings since the summer of 2022.\nWhile that should mean for a quality side, it means there are ample options, and a lot of players to not gel together. The Blues finished 12th in the Premier League last season, and currently find themselves 10th.\nAfter such a spend, Saunders does not believe Chelsea will accept being so low down the table, and Pochettino has only swept the pressure aside slightly after a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace.\n“If they’d have lost last night then he would have been [under pressure]. Chelsea can’t be 10th in the league when you’ve spent £1billion. They’re not going to accept it, the owners or the fans,” Saunders said on talkSPORT.\n“So every time he gets three points it gives him another two weeks to work on the training pitch with Mudryk and people like that. Getting them and knocking them into shape.\n“Like you said, I’m not sure whether the centre-forward is good enough to play for Chelsea. They really need another striker.”\nHis colleague, Jamie O’Hara, believes even more money must be spent in forward areas, despite Nicolas Jackson and Chrisopher Nkunku setting the Blues back a combined £84million in the summer.\n“And then they need to spend even more. I speak to [Jason] Cundy about it all the time and he’s like, ‘we’ve got to spend more money,’ and as bad as it sounds because they’ve spent an awful lot of money but they do!” O’Hara said.\n“They actually do, because they haven’t got a striker that’s going to get you 20, 30 goals a season and they need a goalkeeper because they’ve got players playing in goal that you’re like, they’re not good enough, nowhere near good enough.”\nBoehly will likely sanction more spending, though that will surely have to mean the sales of some players in order to conform with Financial FairPlay regulations, meaning the club’s identity will continue to be altered.",

Um vídeo repercutido na internet mostra um avião que parece “boiar” no pátio em meio à inundação. O aeroporto ficou alagado devido às enchentes que atingem o Rio Grande do Sul. A [catástrofe climática](https://ndmais.com.br/famosos/davi-do-bbb-24-e-criticado-ao-pedir-doacoes-no-proprio-pix-para-ajudar-vitimas-no-rs/) já registrou 107 mortes, 374 feridos e 136 desaparecidos em 428 municípios afetados, segundo a Defesa Civil. O Rio Guaíba, em Porto Alegre, registrou o maior nível da história no domingo (5), com uma cheia de 5,33 metros. A Capital teve quatro óbitos em decorrência dos temporais. As operações do Aeroporto Internacional de Porto Alegre seguem suspensas por tempo indeterminado. A Fraport Brasil, concessionária que administra o aeroporto, informou que os aviões comerciais foram retirados do pátio na sexta-feira, com exceção de um cargueiro. O [vídeo da aeronave](https://twitter.com/avioesemusicas/status/1788268987811504268?t=tXbwv-_goI9_aCGMq02qfg&s=08) deixada no aeroporto alagado impressionou internautas. As imagens dão a falsa impressão de que o cargueiro estaria boiando na água.

    "title": "Reggie 'Smooth Az Butta' Brown reflects on his time at V100.7",
    "text": "A month after being laid off by iHeartMedia and V100 , Reggie \"Smooth Az Butta\" Brown is optimistic about his future and wants Milwaukee listeners to know that he'll still be a big part of the city's nightlife and isn't leaving his hometown.\n\"I don't want anybody to be sad for me,\" Brown said in an interview with the Journal Sentinel Thursday. \"I had a great run. I am blessed. I am extremely happy. ... It's all good. There's no bitter feelings. I understand the nature of the business.\"\nBrown has been on-and-off with the local hip-hop and R&B station for nearly the last 32 years. He got his start at the station in October 1992 before departing in July 1994 and returning in November 1998. Brown then spent more than 21 years straight at the station, at times as the morning drive voice, but more recently as the afternoon drive voice.\nHe was laid off again in January 2020, only to be rehired as program director of the station in March 2020 — \"The week of COVID,\" as he put it.\nMany of Milwaukee's Black residents and hip-hop and R&B fans grew up with Brown on the radio. He was the anchor at the station locally, following layoffs of other personalities, including Bailey Coleman. He was the last live local talent at WKKV-FM (100.7) prior to last month when he was let go again by the radio giant iHeartMedia.\nBrown's time slot — 2 to 7 p.m. — is currently being filled by Trey White, a radio personality based in Chicago. Brown worries about the lack of local information getting into Black communities as the programming is no longer based in Milwaukee.\n\"Now there's no one there that's live,\" Brown said. \"If something happens in Milwaukee there's nobody local to talk about it. It's really sad so hopefully they'll hire somebody. ... (Trey White) prepared my prep sheet every day and he's a great young talent.\"\nBrown discussed the complications radio stations have as they try to compete with streaming platforms and are often stretched thin due to budget cuts. He said the \"downfall\" of V100 began in June 2022 when Coleman was laid off. He said since then its been long days and constant stress.\n\"That was the day I sorta knew the end was coming soon,\" he said. \"I'm tripping that it lasted this long. And funny enough, I was gonna leave in October, I wasn't gonna sign my extension.\" Brown said he had an offer from a new Chicago station that was \"nearly triple my salary,\" but said even Chicago is too far away from home.\nBrown's departure came as a shock to many on social media. Officials and celebrities, including County Executive David Crowley, Ald. Khalif Rainey and former NBA players Caron Butler and Shaquille O'Neal, have left pleasantries with Brown in the days since he was laid off.\n\"People come up to me all the time and say, 'I used to listen to you on the way to school in the morning, (or) in the afternoon on the way home,\" Brown said. \"I love to hear that — it makes me feel old — but I love to hear that.\"\nBrown graduated from Riverside High School in 1982. He said he owes his career to the broadcasting programs offered at Milwaukee Public Schools. More recently, he's been working about six days a week doing club appearances and doing voice work in commercials.\nBrown said he plans to \"live it up\" this summer, including a trip to Disney World with his grandkids and to the BET Awards with his son. \"I want people to know that I'm not retired,\" he said. \"You can't retire from talking. You can't retire from doing what you love to do.\"\nBrown said he is working on something \"big\" next but that won't be in radio. \"I can't say too much. I can't really put too much out there, but it's going to happen real soon,\" he said.",
