    "text": "Camping gives people the opportunity to unwind and experience nature at its fullest extent. Yet, it’s always important to come to campsites prepared and ready for anything, as the outdoors can be quite unforgiving at different intervals of the year.\nA couple of students from Polytechnic Ibrahim Sultan recently experienced such a feat when they went camping at Batu Layar Beach in Kota Tinggi, Johor, and got a lot more than what they bargained for. In a clip shared to one of the students’ TikTok page\n@___zaiddd, the user gave some insight into how the massive rainfall turned their peaceful camping trip upside down.\nAt the beginning of the video, the duo revealed how the heavy rain weighed on their delicate camping tent, requiring them to hold it up from the inside using their bare hands. As the night continued, the storm only got heavier as the the tent tore in certain places, causing rain to come into their shelter.\nSlowing down for just a brief moment, the storm rushed in once again at around 3am.\nResponding to the video, multiple Malaysians stated that the boys must have chosen an improper time to go camping, while others asked if they had brought a flysheet with them, which is an outer fabric layer for tents that act as an additional protective layer. Unfortunately, the duo said they had not.\nHowever, a few people also defended the boys, saying that even those with a full camping set will not be able to protect themselves from harsh weather when it arrives.\n“Some of us with a complete set also will be scared to go camping during raining season. Only those with enough protection can go and do it bravely,” commented another user.\nWatch the full TikTok video below:\nDua orang pelajar Politeknik Ibrahim Sultan berada dalam situasi cemas ketika cuba untuk tidur di dalam khemah di Pantai Batu Layar, Kota Tinggi ketika musim hujan ribut🤣\n[#foryourpage] [#endofdiploma]\nIf you’re planning on going camping soon, maybe reschedule!\nAlso read:\nJohor Man Bravely Walks Through Chest-Level Flood Waters to Get to Work Despite Harsh Weather",

    "text": "Amylyx Pharmaceuticals (AMLX) Soars 2.85% Amid Legal Scrutiny\nAmylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMLX) shares surged 2.85% today, marking the fourth consecutive day of gains, with a cumulative increase of 32.46% over the past four days. The stock price reached its highest level since December 2024, with an intraday gain of 6.50%.\nOne of the key factors influencing Amylyx's stock price is the investigation launched by Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC. This investigation focuses on potential corporate wrongdoing by [amylyx] and certain of its officers and/or directors. Such legal scrutiny can significantly impact investor confidence and lead to fluctuations in the stock price.\nAdditionally, Alpha Wave Global LP's decision to reduce its position in Amylyx by 77.8% in the fourth quarter has raised concerns among investors. This substantial reduction by a prominent investment firm can affect market perception and potentially influence the stock's value.\nAnother factor to consider is Amylyx's 3-Year Share Buyback Ratio, which stands at -7.50 as of April 22, 2025. This ratio suggests the company's strategy regarding share repurchases, which can impact investor sentiment and stock performance.\nFurthermore, a stockholder has filed a claim against Amylyx, alleging that the company overstated the commercial prospects and prescription rate of its RELYVRIO product. This legal action could have significant implications for Amylyx's reputation and stock performance, as it may affect investor trust and market sentiment.",

The alert comes into force from 11am (December 30) and means “strong and gusty” winds are expected until 3am on Sunday (December 31). The alert covers the majority of the county up to [Chertsey](https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/chertsey) as a strong spell of wind moves east across England and Wales. The forecaster has warned of travel disruption and possible short-term losses of power or services. It said some delays are likely on road, rail, air, and ferry transport and that journeys on buses and trains will “probably” take longer. “Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely,” The Met Office continued.

    "text": "By Josh Haskell\nClick here for updates on this story\n HOLLYWOOD, California ( KABC ) — An estimated 1,000 Hollywood residents in need spent Christmas Day at Hollywood United Methodist Church in partnership with Temple Israel of Hollywood for the 38th annual Christmas Day Dinner.\nThat’s where we met Red Wine Jones, who moved to Los Angeles from East Texas a year ago with her daughter and two grandchildren.\n“We’ve been living on the streets but thank God he’s blessing us with a place, and I’ve been helping them,” she said. “Going through a whole lot. It’s a lot more expensive than Texas, and it’s been really hard but good prayers would help, and I’m praying for everybody.”\nVolunteers treated the homeless and local families in need to live music and a hot meal, and those volunteers are from both congregations who are dedicated to being positive members of the Hollywood community.\n“As we live around L.A. and all of our Hollywood neighbors and the tent encampments, it’s heartbreaking, really,” said Ricka Fisher, a member of Temple Israel of Hollywood and the co-chair of the Christmas Day Dinner. “The way we can actually be of value to our Judaic community is to spend this day and give back to all those who celebrate Christmas, especially those who are homeless, who are hungry, who are financially challenged, who have health challenges and who otherwise might just need a safe space to have a holiday.”\nSylvie Belfer said she volunteers simply because it’s Christmas and she wants to make people’s day.\n“Helping comes first and respect comes first,” she said.\nIn addition to a hot meal, those in need are also received toys, clothes and hygiene kits.\n“I love togetherness and I love people, and I thank God for what they’re doing for us,” said Jones.\nThe attendees were of all ages from different backgrounds, sharing the hardships of life, and a hope that next year, things will be better.\n“We need food to thrive, not just survive, so this meal brings a lot, not just to our hearts, but to our souls,” said Issis Mant who’s homeless. “Every day, we need to be supportive of each other, doesn’t matter what skin color we are, doesn’t matter what nationality we are, doesn’t matter what religion we are.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "Добыча нефти снизится – в США дали новый прогноз на 2025-2026 годы\nВпервые за 4 года добыча нефти в США в 2025 году продемонстрирует снижение. Это ставит под сомнение планы американского руководства по укреплению энергетического лидерства страны. По прогнозам Службы энергетической информации, производство нефти в 2026 г. уменьшится до 13,37 млн баррелей в сутки по сравнению с 13,42 млн баррелей в 2025-м, сообщает Bloomberg.\nСнижение связано с падением мировых цен и сокращением числа действующих буровых установок. Крупнейшие производители сланцевой нефти уже заявили о достижении пиковых уровней добычи. Количество новых скважин, согласно оценкам СЭА, будет уменьшаться до 2026 г.\nЧитайте по теме: ОПЕК ограниченно нарастил добычу в мае\nСуточная добыча нефти на сланцевых месторождениях в 2026 г. должна составить примерно 11,09 млн баррелей. Замедление активности в пермском бассейне привело к пересмотру прогнозов в сторону понижения.\nРост числа незавершенных скважин (DUC) наблюдается уже четвертый месяц подряд. Это может свидетельствовать о намерении компаний приостановить запуск новых скважин в ожидании повышения цен.\nВместе с тем, прогноз по добыче нефти на морских месторождениях на 2026 г. был повышен до 1,85 млн б/с. Это приведет к росту мировых запасов нефти более чем на 800 000 б/с — максимальному значению с начала проведения подобных оценок.\nКроме того, СЭА снизило прогноз увеличения глобального спроса на нефть в 2024 г. до 800 000 баррелей в сутки. Это приведет к общему уровню потребления в 103,5 млн баррелей.\nРанее на pronedra.ru писали, что сланцевый бум в США заканчивается – эксперты оценили ситуацию с добычей нефти",

Este sujeto, a su vez había sido detenido en nuestro país por un delito de abuso sexual perpetrado en el año 2018”.Una vez establecida su ubicación, a través de herramientas analíticas investigativas, se informó a la Brigada Investigadora de Delitos Sexuales de Temuco, quienes, en coordinación con Interpol Chile, obtuvieron, por parte de la Corte Suprema de nuestro país, una orden de detención, logrando materializar con éxito su captura.El detenido fue puesto a disposición de los tribunales, para luego proceder con las instancias administrativas respectivas para su extradición hacia Argentina.",

    "text": "TEXAS, USA — East Texans are preparing to ring in the new year with fireworks across East Texas. Before you begin to pop fireworks, make sure you understand the responsibility that comes with fireworks. Texas Firework Laws According to [Texas Department of Insurance](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/fire/fmfireworksell.html), retail fireworks permit holders are promited to sell fireworks for New Year from December 20 to January 1. To purcase fireworks, you have to be 16-years-old or older. In several East Texas cities it is prohibited to use fireworks within city limits such as - Jacksonville - Longview - Marshal - Tyler - White Oak In the city of Tyler, if you're caught setting off fireworks within the city limits it's a Class C Misdemeanor, which is a fine up to $500. In several counties, fireworks are allowed outside city limits such as - Gregg - Harrison - Rusk - Upshur - Panola However, even in these areas, it is still illegal to: - Shoot fireworks from or toward a vehicle and boat - Shoot fireworks from a public road, public land, park or lake - Shoot fireworks within 600 feet of a church, hospital, child-care facility, primary or high school without written permission The Texas Department of Insurance gives tips on how to safely use fireworks: - Always buy fireworks from an established retail outlet. - Only ignite fireworks outdoors in cleared areas away from houses, buildings, dry leaves, and flammable materials - Keep water handy for fires and emergencies. - Never experiment or attempt to make homemade fireworks. - Light only one firework at a time. - Never re-ignite malfunctioning fireworks; soak them in water and throw away. - Never give fireworks to small children. - Store fireworks in a cool, dry place. - Never throw fireworks at another person. - Never carry fireworks in your pocket. - Never shoot fireworks in metal or glass containers. - Wear eye protection when shooting fireworks. - After shooting them, soak fireworks in water before putting them in the trash. In addition to firework safety, officials are reminding locals celebratory gunfire is illegal and could cause seriously bodily harm or death. \"Make sure you get eye protection. Hands are protected and that you're not in an area that's dry, water down the area where you're at and having a extinguishment source,\" said Paul Findley, Jacksonville Fire Chief. Another safe option Findley mentioned is going to watch a professional fireworks display instead.
