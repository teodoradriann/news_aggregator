    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighth person who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victims with ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" [Shopping Trends](https://www.ctvnews.ca/shopping.html) The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "text": "Prosecutor: ‘More young people resorting to violence’ INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — A man convicted this week on two counts of murder was days away from his 18th birthday when he committed the crimes. He is the second man to be convicted of murder in connection to a Sept. 1, 2021, shooting in a car at a gas station in the 4200 block of North Post Road in the northeast Marion County city of Lawrence. Both men were boys in their late teens when the shooting happened. The sister of the man convicted this week was 21 at the time of the shooting. She also faces a murder charge in connection to the shooting. [Israel Eduardo Raymundo Cruz](https://www.usherfuneralhome.com/obituary/Israel-RaymundoCruz), 45, a native of Guatemala, died in the shooting. Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears said in a statement issued Thursday, “We are seeing more young people resorting to violence as an outlet, and it ultimately leading to serious, life-altering consequences. As a community, we continue to empower and equip our youth with the tools and courage (to) do the right thing.” Lei Gamble, 20, was two weeks away from his 18th birthday when the shooting happened. According to online court documents, a jury on Thursday found Lei Gamble guilty of two counts of murder; a count of robbery resulting in bodily injury; a count of pointing a firearm at another person; and a count of carrying a handgun without a license. His sentencing hearing was set for Feb. 28 in Marion Superior Court 21. His older sister, Taleiah Gamble, 23, is charged with murder, and robbery resulting in serious bodily injury. Her jury trial is set for Feb. 12 in Marion Superior Court 21. Isaiah R. Davie-Franks was 16 when the shooting happened. The 18-year-old pleaded guilty in October to a count of murder and was sentenced. He’s now in the state’s Pendleton Correctional Facility with the earliest release date set for Aug. 3, 2055, when Davie-Franks will be 50 years old. Officers from the Lawrence Police Department and the Indiana Metropolitan Police Department responded to the shooting. They found Cruz dead inside “a red vehicle” with a gunshot wound to the head, according to a news release issued Thursday from the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office. According to the release, a witness told police that she heard a single gunshot while traveling east on 42nd Street near Post Road, and saw two males. One of the two was pointing a gun at the red vehicle. The witness then saw one of the two males shoot three times at the vehicle before they both fled. That’s when the witness called 911. The gas station’s security video showed Cruz inside the vehicle struggling with Lei Gamble and Davie-Franks. Davie-Franks got in from the rear, driver’s side door and continued to struggle with Cruz. The video then recorded the two men shooting at Cruz and running away. In an interview with investigators, Lei Gamble admitted that he planned a robbery and was driven to the gas station by his sister.

    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "By Jon Haworth ,\n18 hours ago\nA priest in Florida bit a woman’s hand during a physical altercation while he was administering Communion to the congregants of his church, officials said.\nThe incident between the priest and a female parishioner began at approximately 10 a.m. on Sunday during Mass at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in St. Cloud, Florida, when a woman “came through Father Fidel Rodriguez’s Holy Communion line and appeared unaware of the proper procedure,” according to a statement released by the Diocese of Orlando.\nMORE: 2 people shot during California high school graduation ceremony “After a brief exchange with the woman, it was determined that she was neither prepared nor disposed to participate in Communion,” read the statement. “Father Rodriguez gave the woman a blessing and advised her to receive the Sacrament of Penance (Confession) before coming back to receive Holy Communion (Eucharist).”\nThe same woman is said to have arrived at 12 p.m. for Mass on Sunday and stood in Father Rodriguez’s Communion line when he asked her if she had been to the Sacrament of the Penance (Confession) to which she replied that “it was not his business,” according to the Diocese of Orlando.\nMORE: 1,400 packages of meth weighing almost 6 tons and worth over $18 million found in squash shipment Facebook / St. Thomas Aquinas Church (St. Cloud, FL) - PHOTO: A priest in Florida bit a woman’s hand during a physical altercation while he was administering Communion to the congregants of his church, officials said. MORE: France releases scratch-and-sniff postage stamps that smell like French baguettes “Father Rodriguez offered the woman Holy Communion on the tongue,” church officials said. “At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them. Having only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed.”\nThe woman was immediately asked to leave, according to the Diocese of Orlando’s statement.\nMORE: Climber found dead after falling off highest peak in North America “It should be noted Father Rodriguez had no prior knowledge of the woman’s background,” officials said. “Further, while the Diocese of Orlando does not condone physical altercations such as this, in good faith, Father Rodriguez was simply attempting to prevent an act of desecration of the Holy Communion, which, as a priest, Father Rodriguez is bound by duty to protect.”\nAuthorities have not yet charged the priest with any crimes though it is possible he could be charged pending the investigation. Officials have not given any details on injuries the woman may have suffered during the altercation.\nIn the Catholic tradition, the Eucharist is considered “the source and summit” of worship and faith, said the Diocese of Orlando. “The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion.”\nMORE: 35-year-old man survives grizzly bear attack after encountering 2 of them at national park “The Diocese of Orlando believes all people of all faiths should be respected and that their religious ceremonies or services should never be disrupted,” officials said.\nThe Diocese of Orlando has said they will not comment any further on the incident and the investigation is currently ongoing.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Denver and Arvada get $15 million for major upgrades at two local parks",
    "text": "Denver and Arvada are each getting millions of dollars from the federal government for two parks that have faced challenges over the years.\nIn Denver, the money will go to La Alma-Lincoln Park, where the city recently put up fences in response to complaints of crime and drug use. In Arvada, the money will go to a major revamp of Gold Strike Park, an often overlooked but historical site near Interstate 76.\nThe funding, announced last week, is coming from the U.S. Department of the Interior and its Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership Program (ORLP). The program distributed more than $250 million to about 50 projects around the country.\nDenver and Arvada were among the biggest winners. Denver got the 9th largest award in the federal package, while Arvada got the 11th largest. They were the only recipients in Colorado.\nThe money is meant to serve communities lacking in parks and recreation, \"and where there are significant populations of people or are economically disadvantaged,\" according to Interior.\nLa Alma-Lincoln Park is getting $8.4 million for fixes and new features.\nIn Denver, the money will help with construction of La Alma-Lincoln Park's 2023 Vision Plan, which includes a new skating loop and a \"rhythm skate plaza,\" described as a \"smooth open multi-use surface\" that can also host other kinds of gatherings. The park is in the Lincoln Park neighborhood near 13th Avenue and Mariposa Street.\nThe plan also calls for expanded playgrounds, new grass and trees, new fencing, new lighting, replacing the existing tennis and basketball courts, restoring the amphitheater and bring the park into compliance with the Americans for Disabilities Act — among other stuff.\n\"The park has experienced deterioration in many of its core structures and elements and much of the infrastructure is at the end of its useful life,\" Stephanie Figueroa, a Denver Parks and Rec spokesperson, told us in an email. \"Providing high-quality park space while maintaining the strong character and history of the park is an ongoing, critical need.\"\nIn August, the city closed the park's green spaces, saying it was a response to drug sales and violent incidents. It was similarly closed in 2022 after a deadly shooting there.\nFigueroa added that La Alma-Lincoln Park is high on the city's list of priorities, according to a set of equity metrics that Parks and Rec developed to decide which parts of town need the most love.\nThere's no word yet on a construction timeline or overall project budget. We'll update if we get more details.\nThe city council previously did some strategic money maneuvering to improve its chances of winning federal money for the park. The city moved money meant to rehab Civic Center Park's Greek Amphitheatre to a fund for La Alma-Lincoln Park. The Civic Center project was getting pushed back, and officials thought they could leverage that money to apply for even more money from the federal government.\nArvada won $7.3 million for Gold Strike Park.\nGold Strike Park sits just north of Interstate 76, on the east side of Arvada. If you've ever noticed a big, white pedestrian bridge just off the highway, that's an entrance to the park.\nIt's not a particularly exciting place at the moment — basically just a field, a few pathways and some lonely public art. Many users pass through it on bike or foot as they use the Ralston Creek Trail on the way from Denver to Olde Town Arvada.\nThe city has big plans for the area, including adding a \"nature playground,\" a water play area, creek crossings, a pedestrian bridge, an event lawn, a pavilion and a garden. Gold Strike Park marks the location where settlers first recorded a gold strike in Colorado — the confluence of Clear Creek and Ralston Creek.\nThe revamp is expected to break ground in 2025, with completion by 2028 and a total budget of about $14.7 million\nEditor's note: This article was updated on Oct. 3, 2024 at 7:15 p.m. with additional information about the timing and budget of the Arvada project.",
