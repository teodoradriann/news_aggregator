    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n在最近举行的2025中关村论坛年会上，人形机器人成为最靓的明星，它们活跃在迎宾、交流、主持、表演、服务等多个场景中，或挥手致意，或写诗作画，或演奏乐器。今年以来，在具身智能技术助力下，人形机器人加快迭代进化，并逐步拓展生产生活应用场景。当我们惊叹于人形机器人带来的变革时，少有人意识到：这些钢铁躯体背后正涌动着一条隐形的“生命线”——能源。当人形机器人走出科幻电影，谁来为它们充电“续命”？\n人形机器人是钢铁之躯，电能就是其流淌的血液。为机器人提供持久动力，目前存在两种主要的能源供给方式：有缆和无缆。有缆方式下，机器人要通过传输能源的线路或者管道从电源站获取能量。这种方式虽然稳定，但也限制了机器人的移动范围。无缆方式下，机器人通过自身携带或产生的能源来维持“生命”，这使得机器人活动范围更加灵活。\n人形机器人通常采取后一种方式作为动力源，虽然获得了更广的活动空间，但续航能力却大打折扣。人形机器人具有类似人的外观和行为，能够行走、跑步、跳跃、抓取和操作工具。相比仿生四足机器人，人形机器人需要性能更强大的电机、更多的机身自由度和更复杂的控制算法，这也意味着需要更多能量支撑。而且，随着人形机器人功能不断增加，如配置更高级的传感器、更复杂的控制系统、数量更多的芯片等，能耗问题将进一步凸显。\n机器人的“钢铁之躯”越强壮，“电力心脏”的负荷就越沉重。尽管我们在电动汽车领域已经取得了一些突破，但人形机器人对电池的要求更为苛刻。人形机器人内部空间狭小，需要电池具备高能量密度；人形机器人动作频繁，要求电池有高倍率放电能力，能快速提供大电流；人形机器人工作环境复杂多样，要求电池必须拥有良好的环境适应性和较长的寿命。目前的电池技术在这些方面仍无法满足未来人形机器人长时间、高负荷工作的要求。在实际应用中，无论是工厂中的物流搬运，还是家庭中的家务服务，机器人都需要频繁地停下来充电。\n较为低下的工作效率显然无法满足人们对机器人的期待，电池的“电量焦虑”已成行业心病。如果说数据中心这类固定设施的高能耗问题可以依靠堆砌电力资源来解决，机器人的移动能源供给难题似乎更难攻克。人们通常认为，人工智能、机器视觉等技术是人形机器人发展的主要问题，但事实表明，电池续航能力才是制约人形机器人部署的更大瓶颈。\n如何给人形机器人提供充足稳定的能量？电池技术突破是解决电力瓶颈的关键。一些科研机构和企业正在研究新型电池材料和技术，有望在不增加体积的情况下，显著提高能量密度和充电速度。新型电池如果能够成功应用于人形机器人，将大大延长其续航时间。除了电池材料的改进，电池管理系统也至关重要。通过智能化管理电池充放电，根据机器人工作状态动态调整电池输出功率，同样可以提高电池使用寿命和效率。当然，如果我们可以加快充电速度，在充电量和工作时间之间找到平衡，单次续航时间的长短就没有那么重要。如果再大胆想象一下：有一天我们给人形机器人装上“液氢心脏”甚至“核能心脏”，续航问题就能更好地得到解决。\n人形机器人的机械动力也有优化空间。采用更高效的电机和驱动系统，可以减少能量损失。通过优化机器人运动控制算法，使其动作更加流畅自然，也可以降低能耗。此外，还可以通过减轻人形机器人的重量来降低能耗。例如，采用轻量化材料制造机器人外壳和结构部件，不仅可提高机器人的灵活性，还可减少电池负担。\n人形机器人的未来，充满无限可能。电力瓶颈的突破，将是开启这个未来的关键钥匙。随着补能技术不断进步，机器人设计持续优化，人形机器人有望“越走越远”。（作者：王轶辰 来源：经济日报）\n（责任编辑：符仲明）",

    "title": "Israel launches airstrikes in Rafah as Hamas accepts mediated ceasefire deal",
    "text": "Rare scenes of joy in Gaza Monday as news spread that Hamas accepted a proposed ceasefire deal mediated by Egypt and Qatar. In exchange for its release of Israeli hostages. Thank God after months of suffering a real truce, this woman says. But Israel says it has not agreed to the proposal after meeting his war cabinet. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the deal accepted by Hamas. Is a softened version proposed by Egypt far from Israel’s necessary demands? He says a new negotiating team will continue talks, but military operations will continue. As he signalled at Sunday’s Holocaust Memorial, I say to the leaders of the world. No amount of pressure will stop Israel from defending itself. Or from targeting Gaza. At least 20 Palestinians have been killed in ongoing air strikes in Rafah, says Gaza’s health ministry. Israel’s told more than 100,000 people in the east of the city to move to a narrow humanitarian strip up against the seacoast. We are dismantling our tent for the fourth time, this man says. God knows where we will end up now. Washington is scrambling too. I mean, my goodness folks, I don’t know that it gets any more sensitive than right now as the US tries to keep ceasefire talks on the rails. By involving Arab leaders, A ceasefire is absolutely achievable. President Joe Biden wants to keep Netanyahu from a full scale ground invasion of Rafa, stressing US opposition in a phone call. While in Israel, pressure on Netanyahu to accept a diplomatic solution is growing as well. With families of hostages flooding the streets of Tel Aviv once again. So, Sasha, it certainly seems like these negotiations will continue. Can you give us a broad sense of how far apart the parties are? Well, there seems to be a real chasm over one particular issue, which is how long should the ceasefire last? Hamas says that the deal it accepted today would see it basically be permanent, and Israeli troops would pull out when the hostages were released and would stop the blockade of of the territory. As far as Israel is concerned, it sees the ceasefire, the truce, lasting just long enough for the hostages to get out. But not so long that its military options are limited after that. And in terms of fighting, Netanyahu has already said that that will continue whether there’s a deal or not. All right, Sasha, Patrick, we will be talking again.",

    "title": "States With Abortion Bans Saw Over 65k Rape-Related Pregnancies After “Dobbs”",
    "text": " States With Abortion Bans Saw Over 65k Rape-Related Pregnancies After “Dobbs” The same states saw only 10 or fewer legal abortions per month, despite supposed exceptions to bans.\nBy Sharon Zhang , T ruthout Published January 25, 2024 Pro-choice supporters rally for reproductive rights at the Texas Capitol on May 14, 2022, in Austin, Texas. Montinique Monroe / Getty Images Nearly 65,000 rape-related pregnancies occurred in states with total or near-total abortion bans post- Dobbs v. Jackson , new research finds, while those same states saw only a handful of legal abortions performed on average per month.\nAccording to research published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Wednesday, there were an estimated 64,565 pregnancies related to rape during the periods when abortion bans were active across the 14 states with total or near total bans between July 2022 and the beginning of this year.\nResearchers estimate that 5,586 of these pregnancies occurred in states whose bans technically — though often not in practice — have exceptions for rape, while 58,979 happened in states without exceptions. In Texas alone, where there are no exceptions except for medical emergencies — which, again, are often not granted in practice — there were 26,313 rape-related pregnancies in this period.\nMeanwhile, the study found that these same states saw 10 or fewer legal abortions performed monthly in these states while bans were active, undercutting the idea that exceptions to abortion bans actually protect people who are victims of sexual assault in practice.\n“Like many exceptions written into abortion bans, an exception for rape victims may appear to be a reasonable solution but in practice can create more trauma and danger for patients who have already experienced a traumatic event,” Sami Heywood, an Illinois OB-GYN and Physicians for Reproductive Health fellow, who was not involved in the research, told CNN .\nRelated Story News | Reproductive Rights Idaho GOP Lawmaker Aims to Remove Rape and Incest Exceptions to Abortion Law Polling indicates that Idaho residents want abortion rights expanded, not further restricted. By Chris Walker , T ruthout January 23, 2024 Truthout “No other health care is reserved only for people who can prove a crime took place. That’s not an ethical way to practice medicine. It is cruel to force people who have already been victimized to jump through legal and logistical barriers that cause further harm.”\nSamuel Dickman, the study’s lead author, also emphasized this point in a statement. “Politicians use the idea of abortion exceptions to provide political cover, but those so-called exceptions don’t actually help pregnant survivors get the care they need,” Dickman said.\nOther studies have similarly found that there was a decrease of over 32,000 abortions across the country in the six months directly following Dobbs , meaning that huge swaths of people have had to endure pregnancies that they likely otherwise would not have had to endure. Research published earlier this month by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that states with total abortion bans saw an increase of 2.3 percent in births versus states with fewer restrictions in the first six months of 2023, or an increase of about 32,000 births.\nThe people who had to carry pregnancies related to rape may have travelled to other states to obtain abortions, or otherwise were likely forced to carry the fetus of their rapist until they miscarried or gave birth.\nExperts say that the number of people who are forced to endure a pregnancy, rape-related or otherwise, that they normally would have terminated will only increase as abortion bans go on.\nDue to a widespread culture of suppressing rape and sexual assault victims, JAMA editors pointed out in a note published alongside the research that abortion bans make it even more difficult for survivors to recover and seek care.\n“Restricting abortion access to survivors of rape can have particularly devastating consequences. While some states with very limited access to abortion allow an exception for rape, the very nature of rape may make it difficult for survivors of rape to take advantage of these exceptions,” the editors wrote. “Many of these states require that the rape be reported to law enforcement, which most survivors of rape are reluctant to do, and even when reported, the process often markedly slows the timing of early abortion.”\n“As physicians, we do not see abortion as a political, religious, or legal issue. Rather we see access to safe abortions as a necessary part of reproductive health services to protect the physical and mental well-being of patients,” they continued. “The best solution to this problem is a national law protecting the right of all people to choose to terminate pregnancy.”",
