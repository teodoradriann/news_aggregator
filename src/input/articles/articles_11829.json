    "title": "Top Obama Advisor David Axelrod Sounds Alarm About Kamala Harris’s Town Hall Performance: ‘Word Salad City’",
    "text": "Even when praising her, Democrat figureheads are finding plenty to criticize about Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, with less than two weeks until a critical election.\nWhile Harris has had plenty of critics from both the Republican Party and from voters since taking over for incumbent President Joe Biden in late July, she had generally been shielded from the barbs of her fellow Democrats.\n(If anything, it appears her “Democrat” critics would sooner ditch the party altogether.)\nBut after a torrid — and, according to her critics, horrid — media blitz over the last few weeks, it seems even the Democrats need to criticize some of the warts of the Harris campaign.\nOne such critic emerged on the usually-friendly airwaves of CNN, and that was one of the architects of former President Barack Obama’s successful election campaigns: David Axelrod.\nThe 69-year-old political consultant and strategist analyzed Harris’s performance during a Wednesday night town hall event with Anderson Cooper. He did offer some praise for the de facto leader of the Democrats.\nBut after offering his platitudes, Axelrod offered a more biting criticism when pressed on Harris’s overall performance.\n“Look, I think it was a mixed night, OK?” Axelrod began. “I think she was very strong coming out of the gate, and she obviously came with a purpose.”\nThe former political advisor then lauded Harris for attacking her chief political rival and Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, on a number of issues, including alleged quotes about admiring Adolf Hitler’s generals, which appear to have been largely discredited .\nIs Kamala Harris hurting her chances with each media event? Yes No\nCompleting this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge via email. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . Yes: 99% (148 Votes) No: 1% (2 Votes) Axelrod also gave Harris points for hitting on the topic of abortion in a way that her base will certainly eat up.\nBut Axelrod also couldn’t help but notice that one of Harris’ most common criticisms — her propensity for “ word salads ” — reared its ugly head during the Wednesday night event.\n“The things that would concern me is when she doesn’t want to answer a question, her habit is to kind of go to ‘Word Salad City,’ and she did that on a couple of answers,” Axelrod explained.\nThe Democrat strategist offered one example in which Cooper asked Harris whether she thought she could handle the Israel-Hamas conflict better than Trump.\nInstead of answering that yes-or-no question, Harris, as Axelrod described, responded with “a seven-minute answer, but none of it related to the question he was asking.”\nAxelrod also criticized Harris’s steadfast refusal to take any responsibility or accountability with regard to the illegal immigration crisis that occurred under the watch of Harris and incumbent President Joe Biden.\n“On immigration, I thought she missed an opportunity, because she would acknowledge no concerns about any of the administration’s policies,” Axelrod said. “And that’s a mistake.\n“Sometimes you have to concede things, and she didn’t concede much.”\nAxelrod wasn’t done.\n“You do want to relate to the people in front of you,” he said. “She didn’t do a lot of that. She didn’t ask them questions.\n“She didn’t address them particularly, so she was giving set pieces too much.”\nAxelrod’s concerns are not completely unfounded, as Trump has recently retaken the national polling advantage over Harris.",

    "title": "Column: Cubs Convention is on, while SoxFest remains off. Can an old tradition be revived? – Boston Herald",
    "text": "The announcement of Cubs Convention events Monday helped Cubs fans temporarily forget about the team’s lack of any offseason signings, while simultaneously reminding White Sox fans that SoxFest remains on hiatus.\nFan fests have been an annual winter marketing tool for our two teams since the Cubs invented the genre in 1986 as a way to get people interested in the upcoming season and maybe sell a few tickets. The main difference between the two local fan fests is that Cubs fans generally want autographs and to be close to the players, while Sox fans want their pound of flesh from management for the team’s inadequacies.\nThis would’ve been a nice chance for first-year general manager Chris Getz to get his first official grilling, though it’s hard to imagine the genial Getz barking back like his predecessors.\nOh well. Maybe next year.\nWhether these fan fests are an outdated idea in 2024 is debatable, but traditions in Chicago are worth preserving, so for the Cubs, the infomercial must go on.\nI’ve been covering these events since the Cubs billed theirs as the “Cubs Diehard Convention” back in 1987, when announcer Harry Caray usually could be found at the hotel bar and general manager Dallas Green asked noisy fan Ronnie Woo-Woo to pipe down.\nThe names of the players and management have changed over the last 37 years. Sad to admit the only things remaining in 2024 might be me and Mr. Woo-Woo.\nThe Cubs even canceled this year’s seminar with business management, taking away the soapbox from president of business operations Crane Kenney because of low ratings. He finished just ahead of the owners, whose panel also was canceled. But Cubs fans can attend a reception where they can “chat with Tom Ricketts over a beverage,” according to a news release. It did not say whether Ricketts was getting the round.\nThe Cubs also scheduled a seminar featuring some of the Cubs from the 2016 championship, and hopefully former manager David Ross can crash it and bring some drama to the weekend in case there is no last-minute Cody Bellinger signing to announce.\nAs for the Sox, it’s just another lost opportunity for an organization in desperate need of attracting attention that doesn’t involve gunshots. While the Sox haven’t officially canceled SoxFest, as they did the 2023 version, it’s getting late to book a hotel and sell tickets, unless they’re thinking of pitching a tent in some open space in Brighton Park.\nBarring a minor miracle, it’s not happening. Pedro Grifol skates again.\nMany Sox fans have offered theories for the team’s disinterest in holding another SoxFest. Most of the ones I’ve heard revolve around management’s alleged unwillingness to deal with fans angry over the team’s direction , or with Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf for being Jerry Reinsdorf.\nBut those were thorny offseason issues for many years and SoxFest continued, so I’m guessing the reasons are purely financial. If there was money to make, the Sox surely would be all in.\nI’ve been to a dozen or so SoxFests since the inaugural affair in 1992 and watched many fans get into heated debates with executives Ken Williams and Rick Hahn that were as entertaining as you might imagine. It got everyone into the proper mood for the season, when fans would then move their critiques to Sox Twitter.\nSo what can the Sox do to promote the team without SoxFest?\nThe best bet would be to revive the old winter caravan where the team would gather the manager, some coaches and players and travel by bus to some remote outpost like Valparaiso, Ind., or Iowa City for a brunch or luncheon. When the team travels all the way to their town to say hello, fans are far less likely to start harassing them over their shortcomings.\nUnfortunately, the Baseball Writers’ Association of America can’t help, as we did for many years from the 1940s to ‘90s. For over five decades, the local chapter of the BBWAA held a midwinter awards ceremony called the “Diamond Dinner” at a downtown hotel and invited fans to attend, with proceeds going to charity.\nFormer Tribune baseball writer Jerome Holtzman told a story of picking up Mickey Mantle at O’Hare in a limo and stopping off at his house in Evanston, where his children had written “Welcome Mickey” signs and taped them on the walls. He later went back to O’Hare and picked up Sandy Koufax, then asked the Dodgers great if he could stop off, too.\n“And when we arrived, the kids had taken down the Mickey Mantle signs and had replaced them with ‘Welcome Sandy Koufax,’” he wrote.\nHoltzman wasn’t called “the Dean” for nothing.\nThe last Diamond Dinner I recall attending was in 1985, honoring Tom Seaver, Bill Veeck, Rick Sutcliffe, Harold Baines, Ryne Sandberg, Gary Matthews and others. The late sports writer Bill Gleason, who lived for the moment, was master of ceremonies, and Sox manager Tony La Russa and Cubs manager Jim Frey were also featured.\nIt all seemed like one big happy family back then.\nOnce the Cubs began inviting their players for their own winter convention, they saw no need to bring them in for a writers’ banquet. “We have a hard time getting our ballplayers to come in for that,” one Cubs official told Holtzman in 1993. “We can’t ask them to come in twice.”\nThe Diamond Dinner was briefly missed and then forgotten.\nSome fans have lobbied the current baseball writers to reboot the dinner, noting that the New York and St. Louis chapters have baseball banquets for their fans. But the Chicago writers would need the cooperation of the two teams and the star players. That’s a reach in this day and age, where teams would have to be in charge of every detail to have a working relationship with the media. The Chicago chapter of the BBWAA is also much smaller than it was years ago.\nHoltzman was sorry to see the dinner end, but wrote that an old friend conceded to him “even the oldest traditions don’t go on forever.”\nMaybe SoxFest will be back one day. Or maybe, like the Diamond Dinner, it will simply be a blast from the past.\n()",
