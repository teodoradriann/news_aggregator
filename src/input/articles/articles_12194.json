    "text": "-\nMayo Clinic discovers new role for protein to fight tumors\nMayo Clinic researchers have discovered a new role that a specific protein plays in regulating cell resistance and fighting tumors in certain types of cancer, offering hope for improved cancer therapies and patient outcomes.\nThe protein, known as NKG7, is found in CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill cancer cells. CD8+ T cell resilience is essential for anti-tumor activity. The protein allows CD8+ T cells to continue killing cancer cells even under stress and can help prevent cancer from growing and spreading.\n\"We found that patients with invasive bladder cancer who had NKG7-expressing CD8+ T cells within their tumor had superior survival compared to patients without,\" says Dan Billadeau, Ph.D., senior author of the study, detailed in Nature Communications. \"This discovery holds promise for manipulating CD8+ T cells — for example, CAR-T and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) — to combat cancer.\"\nT cell-based immunotherapy is a developing field that treats many types of cancers. However, Dr. Billadeau explains that a significant problem in using these therapies is that many patients may experience a transient or short-term response followed by cancer progression.\nThere are two main types of T-cell-based therapies:\nCAR T-cell therapy takes T cells from patients and modifies them to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are proteins that recognize specific antigens on cancer cells, allowing the T cells to target and kill cancer cells more effectively.\nTIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) therapy involves taking T cells from a patient's tumor and growing them in a lab. Then, the cells are returned to the patient in a higher dose.\nNKG7 is a protein expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes like CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. A prior Mayo Clinic study had linked it to durable responses from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the mechanism remained unclear.\nDr. Billadeau says that in this new work, the team investigated how the NKG7 protein might make CD8+ T cells more resilient and able to combat cancer cells more efficiently.\n\"We showed that NKG7 works at the lysosome, an organelle in the cell's cytoplasm, to restrain the overactivation of mTOR, a protein that regulates cell growth and which limits the persistence of functional CD8+ T cells,\" says Dr. Billadeau. \"We discovered a role of NKG7 in the longevity of effector CD8+ T cells that are crucial in the control of cancer progression.\"\nThe manipulation of NKG7 expression can be used in CAR-T and TIL therapy to enhance their function and increase anti-cancer responses. The findings may also aid in cancer prognosis, as high NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells in a tumor might correlate with a better clinical outcome. The NKG7 levels in CD8+ T cells in cancer tissues and peripheral blood may predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, another therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, but this needs further validation.\nNext steps\nThe team's work suggests that providing NKG7 proteins to various CD8+ T cell therapies, such as CAR-T and TIL, will give these T cell therapies a more resilient phenotype, leading to better patient outcomes. The team is working on several projects to add NKG7 to these therapies and test them in animal models. They are also performing studies in other cancers to use CD8+/NKG7+ T cells to predict survival and response to different cancer immunotherapies.\nReview the study for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES — Powerful surf rolled onto beaches on the West Coast and Hawaii on Thursday as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushed toward shorelines, causing localized flooding.\nForecasters urged people to stay off rocks and jetties, and to not turn their backs to the ocean because of the danger of “sneaker waves” — occasional much bigger waves that can run far up the sand and wash someone off a beach.\nA high surf warning for parts of Northern California said waves would range from 28 to 33 feet and up to 40 feet at some locations, the National Weather Service said, adding that there were reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas.\nIn Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris. Santa Cruz County issued warnings for people in several coastal areas to be ready to evacuate.\n“Mother Nature’s angry,” said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. “I mean these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.”\nThe same area was battered by the ocean last January as the West Coast was slammed by numerous atmospheric rivers.\n“I feel for the people that are down low here,” said Jeff Howard, also an Aptos resident.\nWhile not quite as huge, the waves along Southern California were also described as hazardous, with life-threatening rip currents. Nonetheless, surfers couldn’t resist.\nPatience was key, according to Alex Buford, 27, who was catching waves just north of Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles County coast.\n“I was waiting for awhile because the waves were really sick, and they’re kinda hard to get into even though I have a really big board,” he said. “Just waited for a good one and I got it and it was a long one. Pretty big. It was sick.”\nIn Hawaii, the weather service forecast surf rising to 30 to 40 feet along north-facing shores and 18 to 22 feet along west-facing shores of five islands.\nProfessional Hawaii surfer Sheldon Paishon was getting ready to surf Thursday morning at Makaha, a world-famous surfing beach on Oahu’s west side.\nPaishon, 30, has been surfing at various spots around Oahu this week, taking advantage of waves during this week’s high surf warning in effect till Friday morning.\n“It’s always big waves in the winter time in Hawaii,” he said.\nHe warned that novice surfers should check with lifeguards before heading into the water and “make sure you got some people around you and stay safe.”\nHonolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards, posted at beaches across Oahu, rescued 20 people along the island’s famed North Shore on Wednesday, said spokesperson Shayne Enright. They were also busy with thousands of “preventative actions,” she said.\n“This time of year produces incredible surf but it can also be very dangerous,” she said.\nThe dangerous surf could also cause surges that could hit coastal properties and roadways, the weather service warned.\nThe post Powerful surf hits West Coast and Hawaii, flooding some low-lying areas appeared first on NBC News .",

    "text": "Speaking to ITV's Tonight programme, Rishi Sunak said he was not a liar and called Sir Keir Starmer's suggestion that he is 'pretty desperate stuff' Rishi Sunak has denied Keir Starmer's accusation that the Prime Minister lied about Labour's tax plans, in an exclusive interview with ITV's Tonight programme. Asked whether he was willing to lie in order to stay in power, Mr Sunak said \"No.\" He added that Keir Starmer's inference that the Prime Minister was a 'liar' was \"pretty desperate stuff\". Mr Sunak said: \"Keir Starmer and the Labour Party are obviously very rattled that we've exposed their plans to raise tax on people. And that's what it, that's what it demonstrates.\" Pressed on whether the numbers were in fact based on assumptions drawn up by Conservative advisors, Mr Sunak said: \"No. The analysis and the working is done by Treasury officials.\" The full interview will run on a special episode of the ITV Tonight programme, The Leader Interviews: Rishi Sunak, which airs at 7pm on Wednesday June 12. Labour has said it does not have plans to increase a working household's tax by £2,000. The estimate from the Conservative party, which is based on spending commitments they say Labour has made up to until 2028-2029 would allegedly leave a Labour government with a £58.9 billion bill. Over the same time period, the Conservatives have said Labour plans to increase Treasury revenue would collect a sum amount of £20.4 billion over the next four years.They have argued that will leave a £39.5 billion blackhole in public finances - one they claim will only be plugged with higher taxes for working households.Labour has vehemently disputed the figures and has launched a fierce campaign on social media, claiming \"the Tories are lying to you\" and \"Rishi Sunak lied to you... just like he did about Partygate\". After the Prime Minister repeated the claim several times during Tuesday's ITV debate, Sir Keir finally called the claim \"absolute garbage\" and clapped back: “What’s happened here is they put in pretend Labour policies to the Treasury and then they get a false readout.“What they’ve put in for this analysis is a mental health policy that isn’t the Labour Party’s policy, he’s put in one of his own policies. He’s asked the civil service to cost it.\"They’ve come up with this figure of £2,000.”Watch Rishi Sunak's interview in full on a special episode of the ITV Tonight programme, The Leader Interviews: Rishi Sunak, which airs at 7pm on Wednesday June 12.
