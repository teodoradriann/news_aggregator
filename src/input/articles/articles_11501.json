    "title": "Strategies to Achieve Millionaire Status with Solana at $200",
    "text": "- Solana (SOL) has experienced a remarkable surge, with its price increasing by nearly 1000% since January 2023, peaking at $123.68 before a recent correction to around $100. Despite a 6.4% correction in the past day, SOL remains one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, surpassing even Bitcoin’s 160% rise this year. - To become a millionaire with SOL priced at $200, an investor would need 5000 tokens, which currently cost about $523,000. Solana’s potential to reach this value is supported by its previous all-time high of $259.96 from November 2021, and analysts predict a bull market in 2024 could push SOL towards or beyond this peak. - Despite the optimistic outlook, predictions from platforms like Changelly suggest that SOL might not hit the $200 mark until at least October 2025, with expectations for the token to remain near $100 for most of 2024. The forecast could change if a bull market emerges next year, but the impact of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval remains uncertain. With its impressive performance in 2023, Solana (SOL) has become a standout cryptocurrency, riding a wave of nearly 1000% growth since January. Despite a recent 6.4% correction and a drop to around $100, SOL’s performance remains strong, even outpacing Bitcoin’s 160% rise over the same period. Millionaire Dreams: Investing in Solana for Future Gains To reach a net worth of one million dollars with SOL valued at $200, an investor would need to possess 5,000 tokens. This quantity of SOL currently costs approximately $523,000, assuming recent price levels. Path to $200: Solana’s Potential Trajectory - Solana’s all-time high reached $259.96 in November 2021, making the $200 target a plausible future milestone. - Optimism for 2024 is fueled by predictions of a bull market, potential Bitcoin ETF approval, and the Bitcoin halving event in April. However, predictions from platforms like [Changelly](https://changelly.com/blog/solana-price-prediction/) suggest a more conservative timeline, with SOL not expected to hit $200 until at least October 2025. The forecast for 2024 places SOL around the $100 mark but acknowledges that a shift to a bull market could alter these expectations.",

    "text": "Bolivian Aymara indigenous lawyer Bertha Aguilar is currently handling 40 cases, from women in divorce proceedings to property conflicts -- all in her local Aymara language - Copyright AFP Aizar RALDES Esther MAMANI Bertha Aguilar is harvesting potatoes on the shores of Lake Titicaca when her phone rings.\nOn the line, a woman speaking in the Indigenous Aymara language explains that she was beaten up by her brothers-in-law in a land dispute and needs a lawyer.\nAguilar, Aymara herself, is on the case.\nThe 56-year-old mother-of-two is one of the rare lawyers in Bolivia who represents women who only speak Aymara, the country’s third most-used language after Spanish and Quechua.\n“It’s different when you speak to them in Aymara, they are better able to tell you what happened to them,” Aguilar says as she tucks her phone away and returns to her harvest.\nThe Aymara represent 9.6 percent of Bolivians. And although the country counts 36 recognized languages, court proceedings are only held in Spanish and there is no obligation to provide an interpreter.\nFor the 41 percent of the population who identify as Indigenous, some of whom speak only their mother tongue, this is a barrier to justice.\n“We would like to know how many judges and prosecutors speak an Indigenous language,” said Lucia Vargas of the Women’s Coordinator group of feminist NGOs.\n“If the Aymara do not understand Spanish, they have greater difficulty understanding the complexity of a judicial process that is in Spanish.”\n– ‘All kinds of bruises’ –\nAguilar proudly dons the traditional shawl, hat, and pollera — a long woolen skirt — worn by Aymara women, even when she is in court.\nMost of her clients are women, many seeking her counsel after experiencing a wide range of sex-based violence.\n“I have seen all kinds of bruises, punches in the eye, in other words, all kinds of abuse,” she told AFP.\nAlthough there are no statistics on Indigenous victims of gender-based violence, “the Aymara world… is part of a national reality where there is a strong tradition of machismo since time immemorial,” said historian Sayuri Loza.\nIn 2023, Bolivia registered 51,000 complaints of physical, sexual, psychological and economic abuse against women. The cases include 81 femicides, according to data from the prosecutor’s office.\n– ‘They defended the man’ –\nAguilar decided to become an attorney after experiencing stigma and discrimination at home and within the legal system.\nShe suffered physical violence and economic abuse at the hands of her ex-husband, a descendant of the Aymara people who grew up in the city and was university educated.\nHe and his family would often insult her, she said, using derogatory terms aimed at Indigenous women.\nThey separated in 2005, but it was a struggle to find a lawyer who would handle her divorce.\nShe said she spoke to “about four, but I couldn’t make myself clear… and they defended the man.”\nAguilar herself only learned to speak Spanish informally after moving to La Paz at the age of 16 from her home in Chachapoya, 170 kilometers (105 miles) away.\nA few years after her divorce, she entered the Public University of El Alto, a city adjacent to the Bolivian capital, where she obtained her law degree in 2012, studying in Spanish.\nOnly 10 percent of the almost 800,000 women who identify as Aymara in Bolivia access higher education, according to a study by the Catholic University.\n– Divorce to property spats –\nNow, Aguilar has a small office in front of the El Alto Court of Justice, with a sign outside reading: “If I am not in, call.”\nWhen she is not litigating, she tends to her small farm in Chachapoya, but she never rejects an incoming call.\n“In the courts … there are many women who cannot speak Spanish,” she said.\nShe is currently handling 40 cases, from women in divorce proceedings to property conflicts, among others.\n“Nayax aka divorciox doctorat mistunap munta” — (I want that divorce to come through), client Silveria Palle, 57, says in Aymara, desperate to escape a partner who has beaten her for years.\nAguilar has the same message for all of her clients: “If I escaped the abuse… why can’t you?",

    "text": "India-UK FTA: Why India’s Farmers Will Be The Biggest Winners In Historic Trade Deal\nWith enhanced access and strategic protections, the FTA will help Indian agriculture transition from volume to value, and from local to global\nIndia and the United Kingdom are all set to sign the landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on Thursday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi beginning his two-day visit to UK to strengthen bilateral relations in key areas such as defence, trade, and technology.\nA major highlight of the visit is expected to be the formal signing of the historic trade deal, which represents a landmark moment for India’s agricultural and rural economy. With duty-free access, streamlined trade protocols, and protection for India’s unique agri-heritage, the agreement sets the stage for a quantum leap in agri-exports, value-added products, and rural prosperity.\nRecommended Stories\nKEEPING FARMERS IN FOCUS\nAgriculture sustains over 55 per cent of India’s population and remains the cornerstone of rural livelihoods and economic security. With this in mind, the FTA promotes value addition and global competitiveness and ensures inclusive benefits reach rural and marginal farmers.\nWith enhanced access and strategic protections, the FTA will help Indian agriculture transition from volume to value, and from local to global.\nIndia’s farmers are poised to be the biggest winners of the FTA, which unlocks premium UK markets for their produce, matching or exceeding the benefits already enjoyed by exporters from Germany, Netherlands, and other EU nations.\nHere’s how the trade deal will help India’s farmers:\nTariff Elimination on Key Crops: Indian staples like turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and processed goods like mango pulp, pickles, and pulses will enjoy duty-free access—enabling better margins and wider reach.\nMassive Market Access for Farmers: Over 95 per cent of agricultural and processed food tariff lines will attract zero duties on entry into force. This will apply to fruits, vegetables, cereals, pickles, spice mixes, fruit pulps, ready-to-eat meals and processed foods. The access will significantly reduce landed costs in the UK and increase the competitiveness of Indian products across mainstream and ethnic retail chains. This, in turn, will lead to more income at the farm gate, greater incentives for quality, packaging, and certification and increased rural employment across the agri-value chain.\nSensitive Products Protected: The FTA excludes India’s most sensitive agri sectors to protect domestic farmers. There are no tariff concessions on dairy products, apples, oats, and edible oils. The exclusions reflect India’s calibrated trade strategy—one that prioritises food security, domestic price stability, and vulnerable farming communities.\nMarket Boost: Duty-free access is expected to increase agri exports by over 20 per cent in the next three years, contributing to India’s goal of $100 billion agri-exports by 2030.\nCertification Made Simple: Provisions related to Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) will streamline certification, cutting down time and cost for exporters.\nDiversification & Resilience: The FTA creates new market access for emerging products such as jackfruit, millets, vegetables, and organic herbs, helping farmers diversify and buffer against domestic price volatility.\nUNLEASHING THE POWER OF BLUE ECONOMY\nIndia’s fisheries sector—especially in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu—will see a dramatic expansion through access to the UK’s $5.4 billion marine import market.\nShrimp, tuna, fishmeal, and feeds—currently taxed between 4.2–8.5 per cent—will become completely duty-free, unlocking rapid export growth. Apart from this, the FTA’s Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures will help Indian exporters meet UK standards with ease, reducing rejections and strengthening trust. Despite strong demand, India’s current share in UK marine imports is only 2.25 per cent—leaving massive room for expansion.\nThe FTA strategically positions India to outcompete or match leading global exporters in several high-potential product categories. Indian exporters will now enjoy the same market access as Germany or Netherlands, leveling the playing field.\nApart from this, the deal seeks to lay the foundation for India’s move into high-margin, branded exports, especially in coffee, spices, beverages, and processed food.\nCoffee & Instant Coffee: The UK already absorbs 1.7 per cent of India’s coffee. Duty-free access will help Indian instant coffee compete with EU exporters like Germany and Spain, unlocking growth in a premium, fast-growing segment.\nTea & Spices: The UK is a key buyer of India’s tea (5.6 per cent) and spices (2.9 per cent). With zero tariffs, these shares are now primed for exponential growth.\nOilseeds: The UK market will enable Indian oilseed exporters to expand their consumer base and boost competitiveness through tariff elimination and simplified trade protocols.\nCraft Alcobev Sector: Indian craft drinks like feni from Goa, artisanal wines from Nashik, and toddy from Kerala will now enjoy Geographical Indication (GI) protection and shelf space in high-end UK retail and hospitality chains.\nThese reforms will help transform India from a commodity supplier to a value-added powerhouse in the global food and beverage trade, promote job creation and rural prosperity, elevate Indian agri-brand equity and place India at the forefront of global agri-trade.\nFrom the highlands of Assam to the coasts of Andhra Pradesh, and from Punjab’s fields to Kerala’s spice farms, the India-UK FTA is set to empower producers, elevate products, and energise exports—turning India’s agri-sector into a global force for growth, resilience, and innovation.\nAbout the Author\nNews Desk\nmarket trends,\nstock updates,\ntax, IPO,\nbanking finance, real estate, savings and investments.

    "text": "GEORGE TOWN: Penang's Chingay Festival parade kicks off with over 40 teams participating despite a sudden rain which came pattering in the evening.\nShowcasing the state's rich tapestry of multicultural heritage, the members from various associations and groups gathered at 7pm next to Padang Brown in Jalan Johor before forming a long line as they paraded through the city.\nThey passed Jalan Penang, Jalan Burma, Jalan Transfer, Jalan Sri Bahari, Jalan Penang, Jalan Chulia and Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling before ending at Lebuh Light, about four hours later.\nThroughout the parade, the Chingay teams performed stunts of balancing giant flag poles on their foreheads and chin, while others complimented the celebration with dragon and lion dance, stilt walking, as well as performances by school bands.\nAt about 11pm, when the rain had stopped, the event culminated with a fireworks show at Lebuh Light, in front of the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce building.\nAmong those present were Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow and Penang tourism and creative economy committee chairman Wong Hon Wai.\nThe name “Chingay” is derived from the Mandarin term for “the art of costume” and “masquerade” in Hokkien.\nIt was reported that the Chinese in Penang first performed Chingay in 1919 in celebration of the birthday of the Goddess of Mercy organised by market traders and other Chinese communities in the city.\nThey carried the idol of the goddess and 12m flags around George Town to eliminate the disease plaguing the area then. The procession has since transformed from its original purpose to the promotion of tourism and was recognised as an intangible cultural heritage by the National Heritage Department in 2012.\nOpen Modal ×",
