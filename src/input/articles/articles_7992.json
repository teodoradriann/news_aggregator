    "text": "By Timothy Nazzaro, Boston 25 News Staff January 25, 2024 at 5:27 pm EST\nExpand\n(Mass.gov)\nBy Timothy Nazzaro, Boston 25 News Staff January 25, 2024 at 5:27 pm EST CONCORD, Mass. — Members of the Massachusetts Correction Officers Federated Union (MCOFU) sent a letter to Governor Healey on Thursday, saying in part they’re “deeply troubled” by the planned closure of MCI-Concord in June.\nThe medium-security men’s prison reportedly employs 300 MCOFU members and houses over 300 inmates.\n“With the planned closing we are concerned over how this will happen logistically and how it will place our other facilities at an increased threat level,” the letter reads.\nUnion leaders are worried the inmates at MCI-Concord will be re-classified to lower security facilities, which they say puts both officers and inmates at risk.\nCiting a 2022 incident where Correction Officer Matthew Tidman was nearly beaten to death by an inmate, the MCOFU says things like that happen when higher security level inmates slip through the transfer cracks and are placed in lower security facilities.\nMass. correction officer has made ‘unbelievable recovery’ after severe beating from inmate “We understand that the number of inmates is down from years past but the inmates that are currently incarcerated are some of the most dangerous and violent offenders,” the letter to Healey says. “We are asking you and your administration to stop the closing of Concord and study the impact this will have in our correctional system.”\nAccording to the union, MCI-Concord closing would be the fourth prison in three years in the state to close, which they say “stretches the system too thin, with no viable plan to house these most dangerous inmates.”\nIn a statement, the Department of Corrections (DOC) says they’re committed to addressing any safety concerns.\n“Commissioner Mici and the DOC leadership team are deeply committed to working closely with employees and their union representatives to address any safety concerns and to ensure a fair and equitable relocation of all affected staff to other facilities,” a DOC spokesperson said. “We are grateful to our corrections staff for their hard work and service. As we continue to shape the future of our agency, we are confident that together we can take this essential step to eliminate redundancies, enhance efficiency and ensure a more effective and impactful correctional system while still ensuring the safety of our staff and incarcerated individuals.”\nMCI-Concord is the state’s oldest operating men’s prison in Massachusetts.\nBelow is a full version of the MCOFU’s letter:\nMCOFU Letter to Governor Healey by Boston 25 Desk on Scribd\nThis is a developing story.

    "title": "Pakistan PM announces ‘strict ban’ on New Year celebrations. Here's why",
    "text": "Christians devotees take part in a parade along a road ahead Christmas celebrations, in Islamabad on December on December 5, 2023.\nPakistan caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Thursday declared a ban on the New Year celebration in the country as a gesture of solidarity with the people of war-torn Gaza. In an address to the nation, Kakar urged to show solidarity with the Palestinians and exhibit sobriety and humility at the New Year.\n“Keeping in mind the seriously concerning situation in Palestine and to show solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters, there will be a strict ban by the government on holding any kind of event for New Year,” he said.\nMore than 20,000 Palestinians, majority of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The ongoing war has already driven around 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people from their homes and with Israel expanding its ground offensive, more Gazans are expected to be displaced.\nKakar alleged that the Israeli forces have “crossed all limits of violence and injustice” with around 9,000 children dead since the Israeli bombardment began on October 7.\n“The whole Pakistani nation and the Muslim world are in a sheer state of anguish over the massacre of innocent children and genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.”\nHe said Pakistan had sent two aid packages to Palestine, with a third one in preparation. Kakar also highlighted Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to raise awareness about the plight of the Palestinian people on global platforms and affirmed the country’s commitment to continuing these efforts to halt the bloodshed perpetrated by Israel.\nPakistan’s New Year celebrations are traditionally not huge due to the influence of Islamic groups who try to stop the festivities through various methods, including the use of force.\n(With inputs from agencies)\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

    "text": "Les Engagés et le MR sont parvenus ce jeudi à un accord sur les programmes des gouvernements wallon et francophone. La déclaration a été présentée lors d’une conférence de presse qui a duré plus de deux heures. Parmi les mesures, on retrouve une baisse d’impôt inédite de 1,5 milliard d’euros. Ainsi, on notera un accès facilité à la propriété via une réduction à 3 % du taux des droits d’enregistrement à partir du 1er janvier 2025, soit le même montant qu’en Flandre. Diminution « radicale » Les droits de succession et de donation seront « diminués radicalement » et leur perception directement gérée par la Wallonie. « La baisse sera de 50 % », a précisé Maxime Prevot. Tous les taux actuels (qui montent parfois jusqu’à 80 %) seront donc divisés par deux avec un taux minimum de 5 % sur les successions en ligne directe. La condition de cinq années d’occupation de la résidence principale du défunt pour bénéficier des avantages sur ce bien sera supprimée. « Au total, les mesures fiscales entraîneront des baisses d’impôts de 1,5 milliard d’euros, a dit Georges-Louis Bouchez. C’est la plus grosse baisse d’impôt jamais connue en Wallonie. » Elle devrait s’étaler sur deux législatures, le document évoquant « une baisse de 700 millions cumulés sur cette législature ». On notera aussi des adaptations en termes de fiscalité automobile et environnementale. Une réforme de la taxe de mise en circulation pour les voitures électriques est annoncée ainsi que l’instauration d’une « vignette », idée jamais réalisée jusqu’à présent.",
