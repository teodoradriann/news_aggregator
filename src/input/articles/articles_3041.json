    "title": "Las mejores alternativas a X, la antigua Twitter de Elon Musk",
    "text": "La reciente salida de medios como 'The Guardian' y 'La Vanguardia' de X (anteriormente Twitter) ha reavivado el debate sobre la influencia y la toxicidad de la red social de Elon Musk. Estos medios argumentan que X se ha convertido en un caldo de cultivo para la desinformación, la extrema derecha y la vulneración de los derechos humanos, planteando la necesidad de buscar alternativas que prioricen la veracidad, el respeto y el diálogo constructivo. Este éxodo, sumado al apoyo explícito de Musk a Donald Trump durante las elecciones estadounidenses, nos lleva a preguntarnos: ¿qué futuro le espera a X? ¿Existen alternativas viables? ¿Son estas alternativas realmente mejores? La transformación de X bajo el mando de Musk ha sido objeto de numerosas críticas. El magnate ha admitido que manipula el algoritmo para favorecer la visibilidad de ciertos contenidos, priorizando aquellos que generan mayor tiempo de permanencia en la plataforma, lo que a su vez se traduce en mayores ingresos publicitarios. Esta práctica, según expertos como Albert Cuesta, periodista especializado en tecnología, ha contribuido a la proliferación de contenido tóxico y a la invisibilización de fuentes acreditadas que no generan tanta interacción, avanza naciodigital.cat. Sin embargo, Cuesta también argumenta que la responsabilidad de la toxicidad en X recae en parte en los propios usuarios, quienes en su mayoría no utilizan las herramientas disponibles para filtrar y bloquear contenido ofensivo. La elección de mantener la cronología dictada por el algoritmo, en lugar de la pestaña \\\"Siguiendo\\\", expone a los usuarios a una mayor cantidad de contenido tóxico. Susana Pérez Soler, periodista y experta en redes sociales, considera que la indignación por la deriva de X es ingenua. Argumenta que, como empresa privada, X tiene la libertad de operar según sus propios criterios, amparada por la libertad de expresión. La responsabilidad, según Pérez, recae en los usuarios, quienes deben decidir si continúan utilizando la plataforma o buscan alternativas. Aunque Pérez Soler considera la salida de 'The Guardian' y 'La Vanguardia 'como una decisión \\\"oportunista\\\", coincide con Cuesta en que este movimiento puede ser positivo a largo plazo. La marcha de estos medios podría abrir un espacio para la moderación y el diálogo constructivo en X, además de beneficiar a los propios medios en términos de reputación y tráfico web. Cuesta ve esta situación como una oportunidad para que los medios de comunicación fortalezcan sus propios canales de comunicación, como newsletters, aplicaciones móviles y grupos en plataformas como Telegram o WhatsApp, estableciendo una conexión más directa con su audiencia. Este cambio de enfoque podría impulsar un modelo de negocio menos dependiente de los clics y más centrado en la fidelización de la audiencia. Si la tendencia de abandono de X continúa, existen varias alternativas que buscan ofrecer una experiencia más saludable y constructiva en el ámbito de las redes sociales. Mastodon: Esta plataforma descentralizada, basada en software libre, se organiza en comunidades independientes interconectadas. La moderación está a cargo de los propios usuarios, lo que facilita el control del contenido tóxico. Mastodon se financia mediante donaciones, patrocinios y subvenciones, y ha rechazado ofertas de compra, manteniendo su independencia.\\n Threads: Vinculada a Instagram, Threads cuenta con una base de usuarios considerable. Permite publicaciones más largas que X y ofrece foros de discusión para fomentar la interacción entre usuarios. A diferencia de X, Threads prioriza la relación entre los contenidos y su supervisión.\\n Bluesky: Creada por un ex ingeniero de Twitter, Bluesky también apuesta por la descentralización, otorgando mayor autonomía a los usuarios. A pesar de su compromiso inicial con la moderación, su fundador abandonó el proyecto por considerar que estaba siguiendo el mismo camino que X. A pesar de la existencia de estas alternativas, Pérez Soler se muestra escéptica sobre su capacidad para destronar a X, argumentando que carecen de la masa crítica de usuarios que ostenta la plataforma de Musk. El futuro de X, y del panorama de las redes sociales en general, dependerá en gran medida de la evolución de las preferencias de los usuarios y de la capacidad de las plataformas alternativas para ofrecer una experiencia realmente diferente y atractiva. Es probable que X continúe su deriva hacia la derecha, mientras que las alternativas luchan por consolidarse como espacios de diálogo constructivo y respetuoso. La elección, como siempre, está en manos de los usuarios.",

    "title": "Lizzo Claims Her Weight Loss Was Due to A Calorie Deficit And Not Ozempic: 'Calories In Versus Calories Out' | The Nerd Stash",
    "text": "The Lizzo Ozempic rumors have been shut down again. During a recent TikTok livestream, the “Good As Hell” singer discussed the secrets behind her weight loss. Despite many fans speculating she took medication to achieve a smaller figure, Lizzo said her transformation was done naturally through a calorie deficit.\nThe Truth Behind Those Lizzo Ozempic Rumors Lizzo explained that making small lifestyle changes helped her lose weight. One thing she’s implemented in recent years is counting calories. Once she became committed to keeping track of everything she ate, Lizzo realized that sweets made up a large potion of her daily intake. So, she gradually started eliminating them from her diet. The star said she stopped consuming “two to three” Starbucks drinks everyday, which amounted to 1,200 calories. She also replaced “sugary” breakfast meals with “super savory” foods.\nAlthough she wouldn’t normally recommend counting calories as a form of weight loss, Lizzo said it’s what worked best for her since she previously had a problem with bingeing. “Across the board, science-wise, [what helped me was] calories in versus calories out,” she said.\nLizzo explained that her mental health played a huge role in her relationship with food. Due to her anxiety, she would find ways to “distract” herself, like turning to drinking or eating. Once she stopped ignoring her anxiety and tackled it head on, Lizzo was able to improve her diet. While going into a calorie deficit helped with her weight loss, Lizzo said it’s not for everyone. “Everybody’s body is different. Find out what works for you,” she said.\nFans Always Assume It’s Ozempic The Lizzo Ozempic rumors are nothing new. The pop star has been accused of taking the medication repeatedly throughout her weight loss journey. In fact, the allegations became so widespread that they were even mentioned during a South Park special last May. After it aired, Lizzo poked fun at the Ozempic rumors by dressing up as the weight-loss drug for Halloween. She even created a fake ad to go along with her costume. “Need self love? Try Lizzo!” the poster read.\nAnother celebrity who’s been accused of using Ozempic recently is Meghan Trainor. The singer shocked fans when she debuted a slimmer figure at the 2025 Billboard Women In Music Awards. She was asked about her transformation during a red carpet interview at the event. Although she admitted she learned “a lot of tricks” for weight loss, she didn’t mention Ozempic. Instead, she credited her appearance to a new workout routine.\nRelated: Meghan Trainor Reveals Secrets to Weight Loss Amid Ozempic Accusations: ‘I Learned A Lot of Tricks’ Trainor explained she had tried to lose weight by doing cardio. However, once it failed to give her results, she changed her routine to incorporate a more diverse set of workouts.\nIt seems what Lizzo said was right. Not every weight-loss method will work for everybody. It’s all about figuring out what works best for you.",

(Gray News) - Never in a million years did an Illinois woman think she would win an instant $1 million by playing a scratch-off. An unidentified woman celebrated her birthday by winning a seven-figure lottery ticket. The ticket was purchased at a BP gas station at 12700 South Harlem Ave. in Palos Heights, [according to WLS.](https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-lottery-palos-heights-gas-station-winning-ticket-scratch-off/14479204/) [WLS reported](https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-lottery-palos-heights-gas-station-winning-ticket-scratch-off/14479204/) that the woman decided to stop at a gas station and buy a $25 Diamond Crossword 10X purple ticket. She said she selected that specific ticket because it was her favorite color. “When I scratched the ticket in my car, I kept seeing wins that were getting bigger and bigger,” she said, per the reports. “As I got to the end, I realized it was worth $1 million and I couldn’t believe it.” The woman was so shocked she went back in to double-check. “I instantly started crying and my legs felt like noodles. I didn’t think I would be able to drive home,” she said. The woman told lottery officials that the money will make a difference in her life. She said she and her husband work very hard and she wants to give her children opportunities that the world has to offer. The store will receive $10,000 for selling the winning ticket.

I am trying to finish strong. I really have not had the chance to take my medal in,\" she said.\n\"After Paris I went back to Texas, did some training. It has been up and down, I am still working on the fine tuning.\"\nAlfred's gold in Paris was the first-ever Olympic medal of any colour for her tiny Caribbean island homeland.\nAnd she said she was now looking to the Diamond League finls in Brussels next week and then returning home for some proper celebrations.\n\"In Brussels I will not run the double, just the 100m,\" she said.\n\"My aim is nothing in particular, just to finish strong. I am looking forward to go to Saint Lucia , just to celebrate with my country.\"",

    "text": "Would you like to subscribe to our newsletter?\nA BC logging company will have to pay $280,000 fine for cutting down old-growth forests in the Kootenays.\nAccording to a Feb. 13 BC Forest Appeals Commission decision, Interfor was originally fined $360,000 for logging the trees in an area adjacent to the Arrow Lakes.\nHowever, Interfor appealed the fine arguing it should pay $40,000 instead.\nThe decision said Interfor was given permission to log the area subject to a forestry plan that had conditions about logging in an area where old-growth forest existed.\nThe logging dates back to 2012 and 2013 and took place in the Selkirk Forest.\nREAD MORE: Remembering the Kamloops canneries, farms and orchards in 'simpler' times\nWhile the company had permission to log the area an inspection found it had breached the rules when it came to logging in areas where old-growth forest is present.\nIt was fined $45,000 for each of the eight areas where it had broken the rules.\nThe company argued it had followed the provincial government's rules while logging in the old growth areas.\nThe lengthy 68-page, 30,000-word appeal, goes into in-depth detail about how the provincial legislation should be interpreted.\nThe two sides argued over how the term \"modified\" should be defined, as well as other wording in the legislation.\n\"Interfor says 'modified' must be interpreted in the surrounding context... (it) argues that the Province could have required other language in the forest Stewardship Plan before approving it if the Province wanted an express limit on incursions,\" the decision read. Interfor claimed it followed the rules and had done nothing wrong.\nHowever, the Forrest Appeal Commission disagreed.\nREAD MORE: Two BC realtors fined total of $12,000 for breaking advertising rules\n\"We find Interfor did not act in a manner consistent with the limitations on how and why Old Growth Management Areas harvesting could occur,\" the decision reads. \"The Panel finds that the planning and harvesting of Old Growth Management Areas for all eight of the impugned cutblocks went beyond what we consider to be modifications to the boundaries between non-Old Growth Management Areas lands and the Old Growth Management Areas.\"\nThe Forest Appeal Commission was also critical of paperwork the company said it no longer had, pointed out it offered no \"satisfactory explanation\" as to why this documentation wasn't available, while other paperwork from the same time period was.\n\"We find that Interfor knew or ought to have known to preserve any documents which may have existed,\" the decision read.\nWhile Interfor wanted the penalty dropped to $5,000 per infraction, the Forest Appeal Commission settled on $35,000.\nThe company will now have to pay $280,000.\nTo contact a reporter for this story, email Ben Bulmer or call (250) 309-5230 or email the editor.
